   New Twists on the Familiar

   Over the past 25 years, in essays and reviews, two
collections of stories, a novel and the remarkable
autobiographical fictions -- verbal snapshots, anecdotes,
journal entries, full-scale memoirs and stories -- collected
in his new book, "Shuffle" (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 162
pages, $18.95), Leonard Michaels has perfected a literary
style of uncommon lucidity, force and ease. These are
classical virtues, to be sure, but Mr. Michaels's subjects,
his voice and emotional range, his intelligence and wit, all
are distinctly American, late 20th century, anything but
antique.
   Out of familiar material -- Lower East Side Jewish family
life during the war, Greenwich Village sex and friendship in
the '50s and early '60s, ever more desperate sex and
careerism in Berkeley, Los Angeles and New York from the time
of women's liberation to the present age of glitz -- he
constructs literary miniatures that are dense but go like
lightning. They seem larger, more spacious and alive with
precise facts and meanings than most gasping novels. But for
all their artful compression and meticulous diction, they're
never precious, never merely out to shock or elicit snobbish
admiration. They always stay close to the way people actually
talk and act when they're too driven by their ferocious,
guilty needs to even think about good manners.

   Mr. Michaels has always cared more about his stories than
literary fashion. Twenty years ago, when cast-iron whimsy and
slap-happy sprawling comedies of the absurd were in style, he
built sharp little diamond structures that said much more
than most about radical sex and politics a la mode. When gray
videotaped minimalism became the rage, he kept infusing
stories with operatic feeling and color and an almost
19th-century belief in character. When feminism threatened to
dwindle into parlor games, he wrote a novel, "The Men's
Club," that portrayed the sexes as participants in chemical
warfare.
   Most unfashionably, he's neither a self-advertising
moralist nor an aesthetic nihilist. He still believes, it
seems, that a literary work has an intrinsic moral power. His
characters seethe and erupt in all too modern ways (breaking
down, betraying each other, spouting radical chicanery or
psychobabble), and he implies that they can and must be seen
as desperate moral, psychological and historical beings. But
he never passes facile, moralistic judgments; he dramatizes
and leaves the rest to us. He often writes in fragments, but
he constructs an immediately recognizable picture of
"contemporary reality." In this he's closer to modernist
collages than to postmodern videos. He's always telling
stories with palpable beginnings, middles and ends. He's
deadly serious, witty and bursting with feeling.
   His new book falls into three sections. The first is a
highly fractured journal of California sex, marriage and
divorce among academics, shrinks and literary and movie
types. We careen from social satire to a quote from Lord
Byron ("And, after all, what is a lie? 'Tis but the truth in
masquerade") to a glimpse of Lower East Side family life ("I
phoned my mother. She said, `You sound happy. What's the
matter?') to garish sexual anecdotes and confessions to
scenes of tormented, competitive friendships. The key word
seems to be "ferocity."
   The central section of the book is the most traditional:
strong, highly condensed memoirs of Mr. Michaels's father and
mother, of a high-school English teacher (a former
ball-turret gunner who brings his trauma to the teaching of
"The Winter's Tale"), and a grad-school anecdote.
   But the last and longest section is the triumph of the
book: a memoir of the author's first marriage that portrays
with great intensity and conviction his grim transition from
late adolescence to young manhood and maturity and,
simultaneously, the shift in American life (feeling, thought,
fantasy) that took place between the late '50s and the early
'60s. Mr. Michaels's fiction has always shown the continuity
between personal and political or cultural history, and in
this narrative the central figure of Sylvia, an exotic
Jewish-American Greenwich Village student with "a figure and
face like Egyptian statuary," embodies the tortured,
torturing spirit of the age. Reader, he married her, and it
was truly hell.
   In June 1960 he dropped out of graduate school and
returned to New York with the vague idea of writing stories.
Walking through Greenwich Village he feels a "new apocalyptic
atmosphere . . . Elvis Presley and Allen Ginsberg were the
kings of feeling, and the word love was like a proclamation
with the force of kill. I saw a blunt admonition chalked on
the wall of the subway station: ---- Hate. Weird delirium was
in the air and in the sluggish, sensual crowds as I pressed
toward the sooty-faced tenement . . ."
   There he meets Sylvia Bloch and, "like a couple doomed to
a sacrificial assignation," they make love in her squalid
apartment: "Through the tall, open window of the living room
we saw the night sky and heard people proceed along MacDougal
Street, as in a lunatic carnival, screaming, breaking glass,
wanting to hit, needing meanness. Someone played a guitar in
another apartment. Someone was crying. Lights flew across the
walls and ceiling. Radios were loud. The city made its
statement in the living room. None of it had to do with us,
lying naked on the couch, just wide enough for two, against
the brick wall." It's all there, even in the beginning: the
violent city, the violent age, their violent sex, her
madness, his obsession, their combat, their mutual
destruction. Such a story brings us as close to tragedy as
contemporary prose is likely to get.

   Pirates Plunder Reds to Stay Ahead

<LP>
   Cincinnati -- Mike York, a boyish looking 25-year-old
pitcher, was called up from Buffalo by the Pittsburgh Pirates
to make his first Major League start against the Cincinnati
Reds to begin a four-game series at Riverfront Stadium here
Friday. He didn't mind admitting he was a tad nervous. "I
didn't know if I was going to bounce my first pitch or throw
it over the backstop," he said.
   But he threw a strike, and then some more. He went seven
innings, gave up six hits and no runs, and the Pirates won,
7-1.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Pirates also won the second game of Friday's
doubleheader, 4-3, when shortstop Jay Bell, who'd had just
four hits in his previous 39 at bats, went three-for-four and
drove in the winning run in the eighth inning. They won
Saturday, 3-1, behind the pitching of Zane Smith, just
obtained in trade from Montreal, and reliefer Doug Bair, a
40-year-old journeyman called up from Buffalo the week
before.
   On Sunday, the Bucs whipped 'em again, 6-3, and, for a
change, a couple of their certified heroes did the damage.
Doug Drabek pitched into the seventh inning for his 16th win,
and Bobby Bonilla hit a three-run homer. That was okay with
manager Jim Leyland. "Moving guys around like we have keeps
you thinking -- you don't get many days off," he smiled.
   Then he paused and continued. "Maybe that's the way it's
supposed to be this year," he said. "Nobody in our league is
sitting back and pushing buttons."
   Looked at differently, though, Pittsburgh's sweep of the
Reds might have shown that nobody else is pushing his buttons
better than Leyland. Besides introducing himself to a number
of his pitchers, the slim skipper spent the series rotating
Gary Redus and Sid Bream at first base, Rafael Belliard and
Jose Lind at second, Belliard and Bell at shortstop, Jeff
King and Wally Backman at third and Don Slaught and Mike
Lavalliere at catcher. He might have jockeyed his outfield,
too, but his main reserve there, R.J. Reynolds, is out with a
pulled hamstring.
   The extent to which Leyland has juggled his pitching is
attested to by the remarkable fact that York's victory
brought to 19 the number of Pirate hurlers who have
registered wins this season. If that's not a record, it
oughta be.
   The upshot of all the prestidigitation was that Pittsburgh
departed steamy River City with a two-game lead over New York
in the National League East and the best record in the
league, whatever the compass point, at 71 wins and 49 losses.
The latter distinction formerly was held by the Reds, the
season-long leader in the loop's Western sector, and despite
a 6 1/2-game divisional edge with the campaign three-fourths
over, its surrender did not sit well with Reds manager Lou
Piniella.
   After Saturday's loss, Lou lamented he was offended by his
team's lack of offense, and added, "I've been very patient
with a lot of people, but I'm starting to lose my patience."
Sunday's setback seemed to leave him more sad than steamed,
but he repeated the theme. "We gotta score more runs," he
said. "We got the people here. We just gotta get them going."
   Piniella didn't say who in particular he was upset with,
but a poll of Cincinnati fans surely would place
centerfielder Eric Davis on top of their guess list. The
swift and powerful Eric the Red has been the Cincy hero since
his 1985 debut, but has been booed doghouseward this year as
a result of a .224 batting average. He's getting company
there, though: Among the Reds position players who start
regularly, only second-baseman Mariano Duncan, the team
leader at .326, has improved his batting average since the
All Star-game break.
   Lack of runs of late has meant lack of leads, which, in
turn, has meant that Piniella hasn't been able to use one of
his prime strengths, the bullpen duo of Randy Myers and Rob
Dibble. Those two gents, wicked fastballers both, have
combined for eight wins, 32 saves and 173 strikeouts in 136
innings. But neither appeared against the Pirates, because,
well, I already told you why. Suffice it to say that the
Reds, who won 33 of their first 45, have lost 22 of their
last 40.
   The Pirates, on the other hand, have been models of
consistency. They won 14 of 20 in April, 15 of 26 in May, 14
of 27 in June and 15 of 26 in July, and were 13-8 in August
through Sunday. And this, you'll recall, is much the same
gang that limped home fifth in the NL East last year.
   "Yeah, our lineup hasn't changed too much, but we're older
now but still young, if I make myself clear," says Barry
Bonds, the Bucs leftfielder. Bonds, 26, has made himself
clearer on the field by making his fourth season in the bigs
his best, with 24 home runs, 90 runs batted in and 42 stolen
bases to date. Fifth-year man Bonilla, age 27, has chipped in
similarly with 28 HRs and 83 RBI, and seven-year vet Andy Van
Slyke, 29, has had 13 and 54, respectively, despite injuries.
   Bair, performing for his seventh Major League team over a
12-year career, chimed in with the wisdom of longevity.
"We've been fortunate when we've had to be. You can't
overemphasize that side of things," said he.
   And, indeed, the Bucs got lucky a couple times last
weekend. In Friday's nightcap, Bell drove in the game winner
by barely beating out a dribbler to third base, and on
Saturday the Reds' Billy Hatcher missed a three-run homer by
a few foul feet.
   Further, they've had a little help from their foes, albeit
inadvertently. On Sunday, Reds starting pitcher Jack
Armstrong gave up five hits and seven walks through five
innings but trailed only 2-1. Singles by Backman and Belliard
opened the Pittsburgh sixth, and Van Slyke hit one out of the
park foul before flying out to deepest center.
   Up came Bonilla and the crowd stirred, expecting a
pitching change. Piniella stuck with Armstrong, though, and
Bobby stuck the ball into the second deck behind right field.
   "I had Dibble ready, but the catcher said he {Armstrong}
was throwing well, and it was still a 2-1 game," explained
Lou.
   Of such choices are losers -- and winners -- made.

   Real Wages Went Up in the 1980s
   ----

   It is often asserted that real wages have generally
deteriorated since 1972. For ordinary wage-earners, the 1980s
boom was no boom at all: Their condition stagnated while
high-income people gobbled up the new wealth.
   For example, the authoritative "Green Book," issued
annually by the House Ways and Means Committee, claims that
average yearly earnings in terms of constant 1987 dollars
rose from $17,062 in 1970 to a peak of $18,109 in 1972. From
then on, inflation-adjusted average earnings decreased to
$16,699 in 1980 and then more slowly to $15,968 in 1989. The
average rate of decrease in real average earnings from 1980
to 1989 was O.5% per year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is these figures that critics of the 1980s boom are
relying on when they say there was no boom at all for most
people who draw a paycheck. Happily, the figures are not
correct.
   In my opinion, the wage-indexing series developed by the
Social Security Administration for various purposes in
connection with the Social Security program is a better
chronicle of wage movements than the Green Book. The Ways and
Means statistics do not really reflect the amount that the
average person earns in a year. Rather, they are average
weekly earnings as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
of the Department of Labor times 52. Since some persons are
not employed in all weeks of a year, this tends to overstate
actual earnings.
   At the same time, because BLS does not study the country's
entire work force in the country, but only production and
nonsupervisory workers on non-agricultural payrolls, it tends
to understate earnings.
   In a final push toward error, BLS figures are obtained by
survey sampling rather than by counting everybody.
   The Social Security series is, by contrast, based on the
total earnings of all employees in the first quarter of the
year, annualized. The data involved in the computations are
on a "complete count" basis and do not involve samples or
surveys.
   The Social Security wage data show the 1980s in quite a
different light from the Green Book. While the two series
agree about what happened in the 1970s, the Social Security
data suggest that wages were in fact 4% to 7% lower than the
BLS data in most of the 20 years from 1947 through 1966 and
appreciably higher in the 10 years from 1980 through 1989.
The Social Security average wage was 2.47% higher than the
BLS average in 1980, and the differential steadily increased
to as much as 14.3% for 1988 and 17.6% for 1989.
   In constant 1987 dollars, the Social Security averages
rose to a peak in 1972 of $18,147 and then slowly declined to
$17,092 in 1980. But since 1980 after-inflation wages have
grown by about 1.1% a year, to $18,778 in 1989.
   So who's right, BLS or Social Security? One way to check
is to match them both against a third wage series, average
weekly wages in employment covered by the state unemployment
insurance programs, as reported by the Office of Employment
and Unemployment Statistics in the federal Department of
Labor. (Because these data are based on only covered workers,
they are affected by legislative changes in unemployment
insurance coverage, and so data from before 1972 are not
comparable with later data.)
   Compare the unemployment insurance numbers to the Social
Security and BLS numbers, and you find much greater
correspondence with the Social Security numbers than with the
BLS ones. Because the unemployment insurance numbers are
based on weekly wages rather than quarterly ones, they tend
to be higher than the Social Security numbers, but the
relationship between them has been constant, while the
relationship between them and the BLS numbers has not been.
   The ratio of the unemployment insurance average wage to
the Social Security one has not deviated much from around
115% throughout the 1980s -- the same relationship as
obtained for the period from 1972 through 1979 as well. On
the other hand, the ratio of the unemployment insurance
average to the BLS numbers, after remaining level at about
115% from 1972 to 1979, deviated sharply afterward. It rose
steadily to 131% in 1988 -- confirming the hypothesis that
the BLS numbers are too low.
   Although both the BLS and the Social Security series show
a deterioration of wages totaling approximately 7% from 1972
to 1980, the Social Security series shows an encouraging
annual average rate of increase of 1.1% from 1980 to 1989,
and the BLS series shows a dismaying decrease of 0.5%. The
Social Security numbers are confirmed by a second major wage
series; the BLS numbers are not. Democrats, Republicans --
take your choice.

   BUSH DEMANDED the release of 3,000 Americans trapped in
Iraq and Kuwait.
   Declaring for the first time that those detained in the
Mideast are hostages, the president said he would hold Iraq
responsible "for the safety and well-being of American
citizens held against their will." The State Department
announced that at least 12 Americans who had been staying in
hotels in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2, "have been
relocated by the Iraqis" to an unknown destination, possibly
Baghdad. At least 35 other Americans in Kuwait were moved
earlier by the Iraqis, and their whereabouts remain unknown.
A European diplomat said groups from several nations
apparently were being rounded up in Kuwait by the Iraqis.
Over the weekend, Iraq had said foreigners were going to be
used as human shields to protect Iraqi installations from
Western forces.

   Nine EC Nations Are Expected to Move
   Toward a Stronger Stance Against Iraq

   PARIS -- As pressure fueled by the plight of hostages in
Iraq and Kuwait grew in Europe for a more determined stance
against Saddam Hussein, European Community members today are
expected to present a more unified military and political
front in the Persian Gulf.
   At a meeting of the Western European Union in Paris, nine
EC members are expected to signal their joint commitment to
enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq, create a
structure to coordinate their military effort in the Gulf,
and announce the sending of more naval vessels to the region.
However, the WEU, the only EC-linked organization that deals
with military matters, isn't expected to send ground troops
to Saudi Arabia to serve alongside U.S. soldiers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At a separate meeting of EC foreign ministers immediately
thereafter, the EC is to discuss ways to free Western
captives in Iraq and Kuwait. Iraq yesterday confirmed that an
unspecified number of foreigners have been moved to military
and industrial installations, apparently to serve as
deterrents against a military attack. European governments
with citizens in Iraq and Kuwait reacted with outrage at
Iraq's announcement that foreigners would be dispersed as a
shield against attack and not be allowed to leave until the
U.S. military withdraws from the region.
   Most European governments are facing calls to take action
against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Saddam Hussein's
hostage stance appears to have strengthened Europeans'
resolve.
   Greece, Denmark and Turkey, which aren't WEU members, are
to participate in the meeting as observers. Turkey, which has
been instrumental in enforcing the U.N.-sponsored embargo of
Iraq, is being invited to the meeting as "a European country
that is directly involved" in the crisis, a French official
said.
   The meetings come amid signs of a hardening of French
military policy in the Gulf. After having distanced itself
from the U.S. military action in Saudi Arabia in an attempt
to maintain its good relations with Arab states and the
Palestine Liberation Organization, the French were
embarrassed over the weekend by widespread publicity given to
33 French people who appear to have been moved from their
hotels in Kuwait and Baghdad. French newspapers yesterday
called on the government to stand up to the Iraqis rather
than pursue diplomatic efforts.
   "Now," said former French foreign minister Jean
Francois-Poncet, "anything is permissible."
   Though some countries, such as Belgium, would like to see
the WEU take command of European forces in the Gulf, this
isn't likely to happen immediately. The WEU doesn't have any
structures in place to exercise such a command. Other
countries, such as the Netherlands, want to use the WEU to
press for U.N. coordination of the multinational military
force assembling in the Gulf.
   The WEU was widely seen as effective in organizing a
European force in the Gulf in 1987 and 1988, which helped
U.S. forces keep shipping lanes open during the Iran-Iraq
war. Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and France already
have ships or material headed for the Gulf that will be part
of the WEU effort. Other countries that signaled they would
support the effort under the WEU umbrella include Italy and
Spain. West Germany will contribute to the effort by moving
ships into the Mediterranean, but the government decided
yesterday that it can't send ships into the Persian Gulf
without a change in its constitution, which forbids military
activities outside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
area. The remaining WEU members, Portugal and Luxembourg, are
also expected to contribute.
   Though several EC countries want to bring military and
foreign policy matters under the EC treaty itself, several
countries are opposed. Neutral Ireland doesn't want to be in
any military arrangements with Britain. And Britain is also
opposed. Nevertheless, many political experts expect the EC
countries to coordinate more political, foreign policy and
military matters after a treaty-changing conference on
political union later this year.
   Military experts in Europe said the WEU response is
already the most extensive joint European military effort
ever and is likely to grow if the crisis isn't resolved.
While many Europeans have criticized Europe's seemingly slow
response, most experts see the effort as faster and more
coordinated than expected.
   The EC governments are trying to make sure they also
coordinate their political response to the crisis. Most
European governments said they wouldn't close their embassies
in Kuwait by Friday as Iraq has demanded. "We will keep our
embassy open and our people in Kuwait as long as there are
French people in Kuwait to serve or to try to get out," said
a French official. Britain said it would keep its mission
open "as long as possible," and Italy said the Iraqis would
have to use force to shut down its embassy.
   According to official sources, France has 281 nationals in
Iraq and 270 in Kuwait. The French Foreign Ministry said it
knows the whereabouts of all but the 33 who were rounded up.
   Last weekend, 123 Britons were moved from hotels in Iraq
and Kuwait, prompting fears that they would be placed at
military installations to deter an attack. British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd called the Iraqi move "illegal and
repulsive." Britain has about 4,000 citizens in Kuwait and an
additional 500 in Iraq.
   Italy has 150 people in Iraq and 138 in Kuwait, while West
Germany has 590 in Iraq and 300 in Kuwait. The Netherlands
has 150 people in Iraq and 80 in Kuwait. Other European
countries have smaller totals.

   Interco and Its Banks and Bondholders
   Tentatively Agree on Debt Restructuring

   Interco Inc. said it agreed in principle with its banks
and bondholders to a debt-restructuring plan that gives
bondholders the right to approve a new board for the troubled
company.
   Bondholders are understood to have pressed for board
representation as a condition of restructuring Interco's $1.9
billion in debt because they believe the company's problems
stem from actions taken by the current board. In late 1988,
the board approved an ill-fated recapitalization that fended
off the Rales brothers of Washington, D.C., but left the St.
Louis furniture and shoe company staggering under a heavy
debt load.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company and the bondholders are expected to agree in
the next week or so on a new slate of directors. Wilbur Ross,
a Rothschild Inc. managing director who is advising
bondholders, said the group anticipates that Interco chairman
and chief executive officer Richard Loynd will remain in
those posts.
   Mr. Loynd, who was named chief executive last year, said
the pact will resolve Interco's "burdensome" debt problems
and "will permit us to capitalize on the inherent strengths
of the core companies." Interco makes Lane and Broyhill
furniture and Converse and Florsheim shoes.
   The agreement nevertheless appears to be a victory for
bondholders, who agreed to swap their so-called "junk"
securities for 95% of Interco's common stock. In May, Interco
proposed giving the bondholders an 81% stake in the company
and making no changes in the board.
   A reverse stock split outlined in the agreement would
reduce the stake of current stockholders to 5% instead of the
10% Interco originally proposed.
   Bondholders have generally shown more clout in
debt-restructuring talks lately. The latest financial rescue
plans for Southland Corp. and Western Union Corp. also would
put a dominant share of equity into the hands of bondholders
and other investors injecting fresh cash. That contrasts with
many debt-restructuring plans last year, such as SCI
Television Co.'s, in which bondholders got less than half the
company's equity.
   The Interco agreement averts at least for now a
bankruptcy-law filing. Interco had threatened to seek
bankruptcy-court protection if it couldn't otherwise
restructure its debt.
   A bankruptcy-law filing is still possible if the
debt-restructuring plan isn't approved by 95% of each class
of bondholders and a majority of current stockholders. But
the agreement increases the chances that Interco could pursue
a "prepackaged" bankruptcy, if necessary.
   Under such an arrangement, any debt swap would require the
approval by holders of only two-thirds of each class of
bonds, eliminating thorny problems associated with holdout
bondholders and stockholders. Interco's advisers believe the
company could emerge from prepackaged bankruptcy proceedings
in six months or so -- a far shorter time than the two years
or more that most companies spend in court.
   Interco said its banks agreed to forgo until February 1992
a $160 million repayment of principal, giving the company
more time to rebuild its finances. The agreement extends
payments on the $800 million in bank debt through 1998, with
the second payment of $60 million due in February 1994.
Interest payments are scheduled to resume in November.
   The agreement calls for holders of medium-term notes that
predate the 1988 recapitalization to be paid on schedule.
These notes mature between 1991 and 1993.
   The plan also calls for holders of Interco's 13 3/4%
senior subordinated debentures due in 2000 to receive stock
plus new 8.72% debentures and warrants to buy Interco shares
for $2 each. Holders of the company's subordinated discount
debentures due in 2003 would get stock and warrants while
holders of its 14 1/2% pay-in-kind debentures would get only
stock.
   Interco's bonds rallied slightly on news of the latest
restructuring plan. The company's 13 3/4% senior subordinated
debentures were quoted by traders at R.D. Smith &amp; Co. at 27
cents on the dollar, up a cent or two from Friday's levels.
The discount debentures were unchanged at five cents on the
dollar, while the 14 1/2% bonds were unchanged at four cents
on the dollar.

   Ford Motor Offers
   Incentive Financing
   On Escorts, Tracers

   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. is offering cut-rate financing
in an effort to boost disappointing sales of its new twin
subcompact models, the Ford Escort and the Mercury Tracer.
   Escort sales are running more than 20% behind last year's
pace, and are the big reason behind Ford's drop in market
share so far this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The incentive financing program, which began Aug. 9 and
runs until Sept. 3, will allow Escort and Tracer buyers to
obtain 4.8% financing on loans up to 48 months. In 10
northeastern states, buyers will have the option of taking
$500 cash instead of the budget financing.
   The moves come on top of an earlier Ford program that
gives $500 to Escort and Tracer buyers who are purchasing
their first car. Fred Ricart, a Ford dealer in Columbus,
Ohio, said his Escort sales have dropped about 50% this year,
but he added that the new programs have already begun
reviving sales.
   Ford's share of the U.S. car market fell to 21% in the
first seven months of this year from 22.8% last year. Early
this year, Ford officials predicted the company would gain
market share in 1990, but now that goal is looking difficult
to achieve. If Ford's share of new-car sales does drop, it
will be the first such decline since 1986.
   Boosting sales of the fuel-efficient Escort and Tracer is
important for another reason as well: It helps Ford to keep
selling big cars with far lower gas mileage but far higher
profit margins. This year, Ford expects its cars to average
less than 26.5 miles per gallon, well under the federal
standard of 27.5 miles per gallon. Ford won't pay a penalty
because of credits earned from previous years, but the
credits will run out in a year or so.
   Ford invested $1.9 billion to develop the new Escort,
which is based on a similar model from its Japanese
affiliate, Mazda Motor Corp. When the 1991-model Escort first
appeared in April, it had trouble competing with the 1990
Escort, which had a lower base price and carried a $1,000
rebate as well.

   "It's a smaller pool (of power)," acknowledged a company
spokeman, "but there's still an adequate reserve." He said
that the 50-block area was "nowhere near" drawing off all
available power.
   Con Edison said that only 10 customers remained without
power because the utility's crews have been unable to gain
access to their buildings to reconnect them. Many firms in
the area had been using diesel generators during the
emergency.

   Japanese Carrier
   Places Big Order
   With Boeing

   Boeing Co. said All Nippon Airways Co. recently exercised
five options for 747-400 jumbo jets, elevating them to
firm-order status, and at the same time took out 17 new
options for the wide-body aircraft.
   An announcement about the options placement, which
eventually could be valued at as much as $3 billion to the
Seattle aerospace manufacturer, is expected to be made
Tuesday in Tokyo. Conversion of the five options, meanwhile,
is valued at about $650 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Combined with orders placed during 1988 and 1989 but not
yet filled, All Nippon now has booked 43 Boeing 747-400s. Of
that total, Boeing said, 26 are currently counted as firm.
Options are important because, while they don't add to
Boeing's official backlog, they seal a carrier's delivery
position.
   All Nippon, which has been known until recently primarily
as a domestic airline, is in need of planes to expand its
international routes. Japan's second largest airline, it now
connects Japan to 14 destinations in North America, Europe,
Asia and Australia, and intends to start flights to Paris in
October, and to New York next March. By 1995, the company
aims to double the percentage of international flights from
its present 18%.
   All Nippon's decision follows a string of large orders for
Boeing from Asia in recent months, spotlighting how air
travel in the Pacific Rim continues to boom, even as signs of
weakness have developed in the U.S. market. In June, the
company received orders for 23 747-400s by Korean Airlines,
totaling $4.8 billion. It also has a $2 billion order from
China's Civil Aviation Administration and a $3.1 billion
order for 747-400s from Japan Air Lines.
   Japan's carriers have been increasing competition to
provide international flights recently. Although Japan Air
Lines was for many years the only one with the right to fly
international routes, government deregulation in 1985
encouraged other airlines to provide services abroad. In
addition, the soaring number of Japanese tourists recently
has strengthened the demand for overseas flights.
   Adding to its fleet of 747-400s, which would carry about
350 passengers in All Nippon's three-class seating
arrangement, is therefore seen as a necessary move for the
airline. Should All Nippon go on to purchase the planes, it
will also lower the average age of its aircraft to less than
seven years from the present 7.8 years. Delivery of the
planes, which will be powered by General Electric Co.
engines, could begin in 1995.
   The planes ordered earlier will be delivered starting next
week.
   In addition to the 747-400s, All Nippon is also shopping
around for about 300 other wide-body planes, and is looking
at models made by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Airbus
Industrie.
   In the year ended March 31, All Nippon posted operating
revenue of $4.3 billion, up 16.4% from the previous year. Net
income rose 3% to $95 million.

   HERSTAL, Belgium -- Fabrique Nationale Herstal S.A., the
maker of Browning rifles and other small arms, outlined a
survival plan that hinges on obtaining an injection of about
13 billion Belgian francs ($408 million) and on a union
agreement to cut about 1,200 jobs in Belgium.
   Officials of FN, 76%-owned by Societe Generale de Belgique
S.A., also said the Persian Gulf conflict should boost its
sales moderately but was unlikely to turn around the
company's losses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   FN has continued to suffer heavy losses this year, but
company officials declined to provide details before next
month. For 1989, FN had a loss of 2.1 billion Belgian francs
on sales of 21.14 billion Belgian francs.
   The financing plan will be presented to shareholders at a
meeting Sept. 28. FN said the financing would include new
equity, cancellation of debt and other unspecified aid.
   The plan also depends on an improvement in sales, but so
far this year, FN officials said, orders are too low to meet
the plan's assumptions. A company executive said it would be
"very, very difficult" to meet all the conditions of the
plan. He said FN could be broken up if the rescue plan fails.
   A spokesman for Generale de Belgique, a Brussels-based
holding company, said it supported the rescue plan. But the
spokesman reiterated that Generale, which granted FN an
emergency loan of 1.5 billion Belgian francs last month,
won't continue to bankroll FN without support from the
unions, creditors, other shareholders and the government.

   Plan to Share
   Access to ATMs

   NEW YORK -- After competing with each other for years, the
two largest networks of automated teller machines said
yesterday they had agreed to give access to their machines to
each others' customers. The move could double the number of
ATMs available to consumers nationwide within a year.
   The announcement by Cirrus System, a unit of MasterCard
International Inc., and Plus System, which is owned by a
group of banks and Visa International Inc., however, does not
automatically give access to the other system; each bank must
agree to open its machines to customers of the other system.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   ATM cardholders presently have only Cirrus or Plus
imprinted on their cards; these cardholders will have access
to additional ATM machines only if those machines display the
other system's logo. As a Cirrus spokeswoman said, "People
will still have to match up the Cirrus logo on their card
with a Cirrus logo on the door of a bank to make sure they
can conduct business there."
   Cirrus and Plus apparently made the move to allow access
because of pressure from member banks that want to attract to
their ATMs as many transactions and accompanying fees as
possible.
   Although some banks may not believe the added convenience
for customers is worth the extra cost banks will incur, some
of the largest banks, including BankAmerica Corp.'s Bank of
America and Chase Manhattan Corp.'s Chase Manhattan Bank,
have already signed up for the new network sharing
arrangement.
   The announcement by Cirrus and Plus was hailed by industry
observers who have long criticized the confusing array of
regional and national arrangements for sharing ATMs.
   David Taylor, a group executive with the Bank
Administration Institute, said, "This is a very positive step
for everybody. It gives consumers much greater accessibility
and approaches the convenience in ATMs that we should have
had long ago."
   In addition, wider sharing of ATMs will relieve banks from
some of the costs of expanding their own ATM networks. Most
banks, with the notable exception of Citicorp's Citibank
branch system in New York City, belong to one network or the
other.
   The Cirrus network has about 33,000 ATMs nationwide
available to 275 million cardholders, including all holders
of MasterCard credit cards. Plus has about 27,000 machines
that are accessible to 130 million cardholders.

   NEW YORK -- The Treasury bond market rambled through
another quiet trading session while investors sat on the
sidelines waiting for hints about the direction of interest
rates.
   But in the junk bond market, prices ended moderately to
sharply lower as investors worried about the prospects of a
recession. Adding to the market's bearish tone, Moody's
Investors Service Inc. reported that junk bond defaults are
running at a 19-year high.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the Treasury market, the benchmark 30-year bond ended
little changed. Shorter-term securities ended with modest
declines. The latest two-year notes, for example, finished
nearly 1/8 point lower, a loss of about $1.25 for a bond with
a $1,000 face amount.
   But trading activity in the Treasury market "was
exceptionally light," said Charles Lieberman, a managing
director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
"Basically, we are waiting for the Federal Open Market
Committee meeting to see whether the Federal Reserve
surprises us and eases monetary policy," he said.
   The FOMC is the Fed's policy-making group, and its members
are scheduled to meet in Washington today to set monetary
policy and assess the state of the economy. Prior to the
recent rise in oil prices that followed Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, it was widely expected that FOMC members would vote
to reduce short-term interest rates in an effort to keep the
economy from slipping into a recession.
   But fearing that the oil price increases may stimulate
broad-based inflation, many economists now believe the Fed
will vote to keep credit policy unchanged.
   The possibility that a policy change could occur kept many
investors away from the market.
   Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service reported that 29
issuers of junk bonds defaulted on interest payments in the
first seven months of the year, representing a default rate
of 5.8%. That rate was only marginally higher than the 5.6%
default rate for all of 1989, but Moody's said that if the
current pace of defaults continues, 1990 will wind up with
the steepest corporate bond default rate since 1970, when the
collapse of Penn Central resulted in a 10.9% default rate.
   Moody's said it expects the default rate to climb as
heavily indebted companies encounter financial trouble
brought about by a slowdown in consumer spending and the
threat of a recession spurred by oil prices.
   In dollar terms, Moody's said roughly $8.4 billion of junk
bonds defaulted during the first seven months for an
annualized default rate of about 6.3% of total junk bonds
outstanding at the beginning of the year. By comparison, in
all of 1989, $9.4 billion of debt defaulted, for a
dollar-based default rate of 4.9%.
   The most significant defaults occurred in companies
sensitive to trends in U.S. consumer spending, including
Campeau Corp.'s Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores
retailing units, which together accounted for 22% of
defaulted debt so far this year. Other major defaults
affected the debt of furniture and shoe conglomerate Interco
Inc., convenience store operator Southland Corp., and Western
Union Corp.
   John Lonski, Moody's senior economist, said higher oil
prices are likely to relieve pressure on junk bond issuers
that are suppliers or producers of oil products.
   But for others, he said, costlier crude is likely to add
to the already formidable challenges confronting steeply
leveraged companies by raising production costs, reducing
households' purchasing power and by keeping interest rates,
and thus refinancing costs, prohibitively high.
   Another indication of rising credit problems is the
mounting level of credit rating downgrades within the junk
bond market. Between January and July, Moody's said it
downgraded four junk bond issuers for each one it upgraded,
including 52 rating downgrades to Caa, a total that is
already equal to Caa downgrades for all of 1989.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasurys ended slightly lower.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at 97 31/32, down from 98
on Friday. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, was unchanged at 8.93%. The latest
two-year note ended at 99 23/32, down from 99 26/32 on
Friday. The yield rose to 8.14% from 8.08%.
   The government sold a total of $18.4 billion of
three-month and six-month Treasury bills at its regular
weekly auction.
   The average discount rate on three-month bills was 7.55%,
while the average rate on six-month bills was 7.45%. Those
were up from last week's auction when they were 7.41% and
7.31%, respectively.
   Here are auction details:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Junk bonds shrugged off gains in the stock market and
settled sharply lower as fears of recession and higher
inflation continued to unsettle investors.
   The junk bond market sometimes moves more closely with the
stock market than other bond markets. But that wasn't the
case yesterday.
   Prices of junk bonds, high-yield high-risk corporate
securities that have low or no credit ratings, varied greatly
yesterday. Most top-quality junk issues ended between 3/8 and
1/2 point lower, while middle and lower-tier issues suffered
even greater losses, finishing one to 1 1/2 points lower.
   Junk bond investors said recession-prone bonds such as USG
Corp. and American Standard Inc. were particularly hard hit.
American Standard's 12.875% senior subordinated debentures
maturing in 2000 plunged three points to 90, while USG's
13.25% senior subordinated debentures due in 2000 tumbled two
points to close at 53.
   By contrast, non-cyclical bonds such as issues from
supermarkets, food companies and other industries fared much
better. Among the market's stronger performers were Kroger
Co.'s 12.875% senior subordinated debentures, maturing in
1999, which finished unchanged at 101 1/4.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds ended little changed.
   Meanwhile, PaineWebber Inc. said its private placement
group has received commitments for $100 million of 11.43%
senior notes due 1995 to be issued by Petroleos Mexicanos,
the Mexican national oil company.
   PaineWebber said the notes are priced at par and yield
three percentage points above the yield on five-year Treasury
notes. PaineWebber said it expects the transaction to close
in late September.
   The securities firm said the placement represents Pemex's
first entry into the U.S. private placement market since 1982
and follows offerings for Pemex in West Germany and Austria
earlier this year.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Citicorp's $1.4 billion global credit-card backed
securities offering was the main focus of the Eurobond
market.
   The issue was split into two parts. The public, registered
portion consisting of $1.25 billion of three-year notes had a
8 7/8% coupon and was priced at 99.91 to yield 8.912%. The
$155 million of subordinated credit-card notes was privately
placed. The three-year notes had a coupon of 9 1/8% and were
priced at 99.855 to yield 9.182%.
   A Citicorp official described the issue, which was the
banking company's third such offering, as a "crisp, clean
transaction in a very difficult environment."
   Traders said buyers were almost exclusively U.S.
institutions. European investors didn't buy large quantities
of the bonds, despite intensive marketing efforts. This was
partly because of worries about how the dollar will fare if
the Middle East crisis worsens. "The pricing seems fair; it's
just the timing that isn't great," said a syndicate manager
at a European bank.
   Meanwhile, prices of most global government bonds
continued to tumble, and interest rates rose on concern about
events in the Persian Gulf.
   Hardest hit among the major markets was France, where
prices fell nearly one point. Among benchmark French
government bonds, the 8.5% issue due 2019 fell 0.93 point
from late Friday in Paris to 82.00 to yield 10.49%.
   British and West German government bonds ended moderately
lower.
   But in Japan, prices of most government bonds firmed after
the Finance Ministry supported the market by purchasing 90
billion yen ($614.6 million) of government bonds. Still, the
yield on the benchmark No. 119 bond remained above 8%.
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the No. 119 bond
was priced to yield 8.03%. The yield was as high as 8.10%
before the Finance Ministry purchases.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds moved off lows and ended unchanged to 1/8
point lower.
   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issue of 2018 was 1/8 lower at 97 7/8 bid to yield
7.36%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices closely reflected the Treasury market's activity.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities
for September delivery were off 1/32 at 98 15/32; Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 1/2% securities were down 3/32 at
98; and Federal National Mortgage Association 9 1/2%
securities were 3/32 lower at 98 17/32.

   PITTSBURGH -- Cyclops Industries Inc. said it will close

   The steel company said efforts to make the division

   Mr. Weisstein, 51 years old, said he was leaving because
"my contract is at an end," and "it's my desire to get into a
larger bank where the challenges might be a bit more
expansive." During his tenure, the bank's assets grew to
about $173 million from about $120 million, he said.

   CAMDEN, N.J. -- John W. Argabright, senior vice president
of Campbell Soup Co. and president of its international
division, decided to retire early.
   Mr. Argabright, who will turn 55 years old in October,
joined Campbell in 1986 as a vice president and took charge
of the international division. The group of businesses hasn't
been a bright spot for the food products company in recent
years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In late May, Campbell put its least profitable foreign
operations on the block, conceding that these businesses
can't deliver adequate returns to shareholders. The move also
is part of Campbell's companywide cost-cutting measures.
   Among the businesses for sale are Campbell's British
frozen vegetable and seafood lines of its Freshbake Foods
unit and its Italian cookie company, D. Lazzaroni &amp; Co.,
which has been plagued with production and distribution
problems.
   Mr. Argabright said his retirement will take effect when a
successor is named. While he plans to spend more time with
his family, he said, he also wants to return to his "first
love -- consumer marketing and advertising."

   The controversial Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant,
long at the center of the battle between opponents and
supporters of nuclear power, is up and running at full power.
   The $6.6 billion plant was completed four years ago, 14
years after construction began, but it sat idle while various
groups challenged the adequacy of evacuation plans in the
event of an accident at the plant. It received a full-power
license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission earlier this
year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The plant, owned by 11 New England utilities, had been
tested at the 100% power level in recent weeks. It started
full-power operations on Sunday and will produce 1,150
megawatts of electricity -- enough to supply one million
homes, Seabrook officials said.
   The prolonged battle over Seabrook caused substantial
write-offs for several of its owners and eventually led to
the bankruptcy-protection filing by its lead owner, Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire. The utility couldn't service
the debt it took on to finance its Seabrook stake.
   Several legal challenges over the adequacy of evacuation
plans remain, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
conducting an inquiry into its own procedures in licensing
the plant. But analysts believe it is highly unlikely that
the plant's license will be revoked.

   A Chair Too Timeless
   For Business to Buy?
                                                                                                       

</LP>
<TEXT>
   THE CHAIR is strong, graceful and prize winning.
Homeowners snap it up. Why don't businesspeople?
   Joey Mancini and Gaby Dorell of Brooklyn, N.Y., designed
their Karina side chair for Sawaya &amp; Moroni, a furniture
maker in Milan. The chair is made entirely of beechwood,
including plywood seat and back support. The back is made
with a new steam-pressure process that allows the plywood to
be tightly curved around the rear leg. The chair also comes
with a leather back and seat.
   The Karina looks delicate, but it survived rocking back
and forth under a 400-pound load. The Israel Museum in
Jerusalem has just added the chair to its collection, and ID,
International Design magazine has given it a "best" in its
1990 design review.
   Nevertheless, sales are mixed. Pia DeLeon, a salesperson
at DIVA, a Los Angeles importer, says the Karina has been
"very successful" with homeowners, but much less so with
hotels, restaurants and offices. Carole Tresselt, a principal
at Frederic Williams, a New York wholesaler, says U.S.
companies would "rather go with an $80 chair" than one that,
like the Karina, costs $650.
   Ivan Luini of New York, who represents the Italian
manufacturer, says the Karina's sales reflect a fundamental
difference between Europe and America. European companies are
willing to spend more on chairs because they "expect to keep
them for a long time," says Mr. Luini. U.S. companies are
loath to spend a lot, he says, because they are "always
remodeling."
                                                                                                       

   Trying to Strike Balance
   On Use of Hardwoods
                                                                                                       

   BOWING TO concern about rain forests, furniture makers
have cut back on their use of tropical hardwoods. But some
environmentalists aren't satisfied.
   Herman Miller says it's phasing out the use of tropical
woods in its "standard" products, if the wood can't be
obtained from "sustained-yield" sources. Its Eames lounge
chair, for example, will be offered only in alternative
veneers once the company exhausts its supply of South
American rosewood. But Herman Miller will continue using
traditional hardwoods for custom furniture, where requested.
   Steelcase says it has discontinued mahogany on many of its
better-selling lines. The company will still use mahogany on
its "high-end, low-volume" furniture, where the wood is
"essential to the nature of the design," but only if it has
been harvested under "strict controls."
   Rainforest Action Network, San Francisco, writes other
furniture companies urging them to follow Herman Miller's
"responsible lead." But Earth Access isn't appeased. Cymie
Payne, director of the Cambridge, Mass., group, says the wood
industry and environmentalists are talking different
languages.
   When timber companies refer to "sustainable" forest
practices, Ms. Payne says, they mean being able to cut the
same number of trees year after year. For Earth Access, she
says, sustainable means making sure that the number of plant
and animal species stays the same.
                                                                                                       

   Window Shopping Grows
   More Mechanical
                                                                                                       

   DISPLAY mannequins are becoming more abstract, mirroring
modern times.
   Boston's Origo Corp., a startup, offers a flexible
mannequin with 10 interchangeable heads and optional
illuminated crowns. Designer Farsad Labbauf says realistic
human forms "no longer convey the message of how abstract
human life has become in the last decade -- everything is
dealt with as a button."
   Established manufacturers warn about going too far. "The
retail industry is pretty conservative," says Bill Frappier,
national sales director for Goldsmith, a mannequin maker in
Long Island City, N.Y. Nevertheless, Mr. Frappier
acknowledges that many retailers prefer abstract displays,
which let them ignore makeup and hairdo. And he says a
robot-like mannequin called Multi-Man "turned this company
around."
   Greneker, Los Angeles, makes a mannequin with a color TV
monitor for a head and a skateboard for a base. The company
also hopes to produce one with security cameras in place of
eyes.
   There are holdouts against abstraction and robotics. Adel
Rootstein, New York, continues to turn out startlingly
realistic copies of men and women, with suntan and five
o'clock shadow optional. Executive vice president Nellie Fink
says, "A fabulous-looking mannequin makes a shopper think:
`That's what I'm going to look like in that suit or dress,'"
while an abstract display "loses the fantasy that shopping is
all about."

   Volvo Unveils New Luxury-Car Series
   To Counter Japanese Rivals in Europe

   GOTHENBURG, Sweden -- AB Volvo unveiled a new
top-of-the-line car model, the first in a spate of new models
planned by Swedish auto makers to fend off the imminent
incursion into Europe by Japanese car companies.
   Volvo said its new 900 series would be followed by the
launch of at least one other new model family by 1995.
Swedish archrival Saab Automobile AB -- in which General
Motors Corp. holds a 50% stake -- also plans to introduce
three new car models by the mid-1990s. The pace is unheard of
for the two Swedish companies, at which the traditional rate
of model debuts has been closer to one a decade.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But officials at Volvo and Saab admit the lack of exciting
new cars has intensified a recent sales slump and caused both
to lose ground to more nimble rivals, such as Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG and Daimler-Benz AG. The German car giants
have replaced almost their entire model ranges in recent
years. For Volvo and Saab, the challenge of catching up will
be complicated further by the arrival in earnest of the
Japanese in Europe, the officials said.
   Roger Holtback, president of Volvo's car division, warned
that intensifying competition from Japanese rivals promises
"to make Europe the auto industry's main battleground in the
1990s. We know that other Japanese companies will join Honda
Motor Co., Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. in setting
up manufacturing operations in Europe," he said.
   Volvo's response must be more frequent model changes,
despite the soaring costs of developing new models, Mr.
Holtback added. He also promised that the drive for growth in
Europe would steer design of new Volvo models. That strategy
addresses frequent criticism in Europe of Volvos for being
primarily styled for tastes in the U.S., the company's
biggest single market.
   The European slant is apparent in the sleek, rounded lines
of Volvo's most luxurious 960 model, which breaks with the
boxy profile of Volvo's previous exclusive model, the
eight-year-old 760. But an even bigger surprise rests under
the hood -- a powerful 3-liter, six-cylinder engine which Mr.
Holtback compared favorably with high-performance engines of
any other European luxury-car maker.
   Industry analysts agreed that the new engine probably
would be the first from Volvo muscular enough to earn serious
respect from performance-minded car buyers in central Europe.
But these analysts added that Volvo could have problems
cultivating a more performance-oriented image among European
car buffs without driving away existing customers.
   Many Volvo buyers prize the company's image as an
ultra-safe family car with a quirky cachet and high resale
value. Reflecting that performance-safety balancing act,
Volvo equipped the 960 model with an elaborate built-in
child-restraint seat, which it said was a first for any car
maker.
   As proof of how serious Volvo is about quicker model
changes, Mr. Holtback boasted that development of the new 900
series had been completed in just two years. But it cost a
hefty 2 billion Swedish kronor ($350 million). The new
model's engine and transmission were the first in a new
drive-train program that when completed will have swallowed
at least six years and an estimated 6 billion kronor, Mr.
Holtback suggested.
   Moreover, the advent of the 900 series leaves Volvo with
five model families. According to Mr. Holtback "that's
obviously a broader product range than we need for the time
being. The message we're giving customers and dealers is that
in the coming five years we will reduce the number of model
families to three with more distinct profiles."
   The 900 series will be one obvious survivor; so will the
the mid-size 400 series model produced by Netherlands-based
affiliate Volvo Car BV. Volvo is negotiating to acquire the
70% it doesn't already own of Volvo Car BV from the Dutch
government.
   The third model is almost certain to be the 600 series, a
long-awaited successor to Volvo's big-selling, 25-year-old
200 series. Most analysts expect the 600 series to debut next
fall. Volvo refuses to discuss possible model changes in line
with company policy.
   Whenever it comes, the 600 looms as a make-or-break
product decision, analysts said. Buoyant sales of the new
model will be necessary to meet Volvo's internal growth
target -- to 500,000 cars a year by 1996 from roughly 410,000
units now.
   Costs of developing the new 900 and expected 600 models
have stretched Volvo, eating into the car division's
operating profit in recent years amid dwindling sales in
Sweden, the U.K. and the U.S. The three markets account for
70% of the company's sales.
   Mr. Holtback predicted that by the mid-1990s, Volvo's
alliance with France's Renault "will kick in as an insurance
policy." He predicted that tighter links with Renault and
expanded Volvo manufacturing operations outside Sweden would
ensure a strong position in Europe. And joint development
work on major components would help both concerns bear the
skyrocketing costs of surviving the fierce competition
expected in Europe.

   MILAN, Italy -- A Milanese stockbrokers' committee met to
try to avert the forced liquidation of stock held by
Commissionaria Lombardfin S.p.A.
   The meeting was amid concern that time may be running out
for a solution to the brokerage's problems, which contributed
to a further plunge on the Milan Stock Exchange.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lombardfin problems stem from its purchase of a 32% stake
in Partecipazioni Finanziarie &amp; Industriali (PAF), 52%-owned
by Gianni Varasi and his family. Italian press reports have
put the value of that purchase at about 100 billion lire ($88
million).
   Lombardfin's difficulties have been public knowledge for
several weeks. But the situation worsened Friday when a group
of creditor banks was unable to agree to roll over loans that
Lombardfin had taken to help finance the acquisition of the
PAF stake.
   The Varasi family's majority stake apparently leaves
Lombardfin's holding with little strategic value.
   Bruno Pazzi, the newly appointed president of Consob, the
Milan stock market's regulatory body, has made it clear that
he regards a forced liquidation of the broker's portfolio as
a last resort, and would prefer that a compromise be reached.
   PAF shares fell a further 3% to 4,900 lire ($4.29)
yesterday after shedding nearly 20% in panic selling Friday
on news of the impasse between Lombardfin and its banks.

   Out of the Closet: Boston's Art Treasures Seen at Last

   Boston -- For more than 4,000 years, King Cheops's feet
were hidden beneath the Great Pyramid at Giza. For the past
77 years, they have languished in the temperature --
and-humidity-controlled storage rooms of the Museum of Fine
Arts here.
   Unearthed in 1913 by a museum expedition party, the
three-inch chunk of calcite is all that remains of one of
three known statues of the pharoah. Long-toed and elegantly
slender, the feet were considered too fragmentary to be
shown.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But after years of obscurity, Cheops's feet have finally
stepped into the limelight, along with five Federal-style
chairs, a fake Fragonard and Emily Babcock Alward's
19-century court gown. They've all been put on show together
after years of being stuck away in the museum's storerooms.
   At a time when some museums, such as New York's
Guggenheim, are selling off the lesser items in their
collections, the MFA has organized a tribute to them --
"Unlocking the Hidden Museum: Riches From the Storerooms." As
with many big museums, the bulk of the museum's more than a
million objects lie in storage. A no-frills affair down to
the museum packing crates that serve as mounts, this
eccentric and engaging show, up till Sept. 9, tries to
explain why.
   The first room is, in effect, a concrete argument for
owning too much of a good thing, but against showing all of
it. To make this point, five near-identical English porcelain
goat-and-bee cream jugs are grouped in one vitrine, not far
from the five Federal-style chairs, four Kashmiri shawls and
70 stone "shawabtis", bearded pharaonic servitors from the
tomb of the Nubian pharoah, Taharqa. Eager to avoid chores in
the after-life, Taharqa was buried with more than 1,000 of
the statues. The museum got to take home half after
excavating his tomb in 1918, adding to a considerable
"shawabti" collection that eventually would total just under
10,000. Though of great interest to scholars, the entire
group has never been displayed. "It might sink the floor,"
one curator remarked.
   In fact, the museum has so many artifacts from the Middle
Eastern digs it sponsored from 1905 to 1942, that less than
10% can be shown at one time. Many of the artifacts have
never been exhibited; more to the point, many still are
packed in their original shipping crates.
   "You don't have to go to Egypt to excavate, you just have
to go into our basement," said Rita Freed, curator of
Egyptian and Ancient Near Eastern Art.
   With such a wealth of objects, a big museum can afford to
be choosy about what it exhibits. So while John Singleton
Copley's portrait of Samuel Adams hangs in public view, his
merely adequate rendering of Robert Hooper Jr. is relegated
to a backroom. Both are on view here, among similar pairings
of the great and not-so-great.
   And so are a few of the museum's mistakes. That Fragonard,
for example, which the museum bought in 1944 only to discover
that it was an 18th-century copy. Shown alongside the real
thing, Fragonard's "The Good Mother" -- borrowed for the show
-- the copy is now a denizen of the storeroom, along with the
fake Roman head and the Egyptian tomb sculpture that turned
out to be a modern forgery cobbled together from ancient
planks of wood.
   The museum keeps its fakes on hand for research purposes,
but occasionally they spring a few surprises of their own.
Thanks to its glossy, unblemished surface, a red-lacquered
Greek vase given to the museum in 1941 was considered a
19th-century forgery. But when a conservator pulled the vase
from a storeroom shelf for this show, he noticed fine
crackles on the surface. X-ray studies revealed that the vase
had been put together from broken fragments and then
over-zealously painted and varnished. Although badly damaged,
it almost certainly dates from the late 5th century B.C. A
small area of the vase has been cleaned of its overpaint, all
of which will be removed after the show.
   Other objects go in and out of storage for reasons that
have more to do with taste than authenticity. Back in 1890,
Henri Regnault's paintings were so admired that the citizens
of Boston took up a subscription to purchase his enormous
"Automedon With the Horses of Achilles." But by 1940, the
10-by-10-foot painting of the nearly nude hero with his
snorting chargers looked dated next to impressionist art.
   M. Regnault's painting has drawn a lot of favorable
attention since emerging from its 20-year stint in the
storeroom, and may eventually return to the gallery. However,
other victims of changing taste, such as Ignacio Zuloaga y
Zabaleta's 1910 "My Uncle Daniel and His Family" -- which
depicts a group of mantilla -- clad, fan-flipping women posed
before a turbid landscape -- seem likely to remain in the
storeroom for a few more decades at least.
   Perhaps the most engrossing section of this show is
devoted to the fragile, the fragmented and the damaged.
Shards of ancient pottery and scraps of thousand-year-old
fabric are important resources for scholars and historians,
but rarely are displayed.
   Other things are kept out of view for their own good.
Edvard Munch's lithograph "The Scream" once was a vivid red.
Now, displayed under the linen flaps that protect it from
further degradation, it is a watery pink from too much
exposure to light and may never be exhibited again.
   Many objects need elaborate and costly restoration before
they can be exhibited. Ironically, this show gave curators
the support to fix some of them up. A tattered 10th-century
Chinese wall screen has been carefully fitted with patches of
new silk, tinted to blend with the original surface. And
conservators spent two years cleaning and resetting more than
10,000 tiny ivory tiles in an 18th-century Indian bookcase.
   Some artifacts wait a century or more for repairs.
Upstairs in an airy conservation studio, Pamela Hatchfield,
one of the show's four curators, is at work on a 3,000
year-old Egyptian coffin that hasn't been treated, much less
exhibited, since it came to the museum in 1872. The coffin
still would be in storage, water-splotched, splintered and
flaking gesso hieroglyphics, if it were not among the more
than 400 objects now being readied for 10-year loans to
museums in Dallas and San Antonio, Texas.
   MFA curators are quick to point to such loans when asked
why storing art isn't the same thing as hoarding it. However,
in the final room of the exhibition that distinction becomes
blurred. Filled with works that MFA curators say are just too
big, too small or too strange to display, it contains
everything from cases of tiny carved netsuke and jewel-like
miniatures, to a Renaissance triptych. Dan Flavin's glaring
light sculpture, "Monument for V. Tatlin" -- isolated here
behind a partition -- isn't shown because its harsh beams
could damage paintings. More to the point, the museum doesn't
have enough 1960s' pop art for a separate gallery. And there
is no textile wing to display the long-trained,
gold-embroidered gown that Mrs. Alward wore to meet Queen
Victoria.
   Eventually, curators say, they hope to have gallery space
for all these objects. But now that museum goers have seen
these treasures, they may not be content to see them return
to storeroom obscurity. Well-meaning curators may have opened
a richly furnished Pandora's box. Writing in the visitors'
comment book, Lisbeth Edgar of Manhattan had one question
that the exhibition failed to answer: "Why are you hogging so
much art?" she demanded.

   Dollar Ends Mixed in Light Trading
   As Yen Gains and Swiss Franc Declines

   NEW YORK -- The dollar ended mixed in thin trading as
dealings focused on cross, or non-dollar, activity. The yen
gained and the Swiss franc declined, switching their recent
roles as leading and lagging currencies.
   Yesterday's results represented no shifts in investor
sentiment, but, rather, a light market's natural tendency to
consolidate when faced with a lack of political and economic
news on which to trade the dollar.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Instead, Saudi Arabia's confirmation that it would make up
half of the oil production lost from Kuwait and Iraq was seen
as a good excuse to take profits on short, or oversold, yen
positions by buying the Japanese unit against European
currencies.
   The weakening of European units, along with the improved
oil-supply picture, encouraged some independent dollar
buying, cushioning its decline against the yen.
   Once put in the mood to level holdings, foreign exchange
investors chose to sell the Swiss franc against more than
just the yen. As a result, the generally well-bid safe-haven
currency put in the worst performance among major currencies
yesterday.
   The yen-mark cross rate served as the barometer for
trading in all three world markets. By the time London
closed, North American dealers had already given up on
achieving any significant dollar movements and instead
focused on swinging the greenback just enough to push the
mark below support at 94 yen and keep it there.
   The break occurred right after the European market closed
down. The mark was last quoted in New York trading yesterday
at 93.66 yen, well below 95.23 yen late Friday.
   By that time, the dollar was changing hands at 146.44 yen,
down from 147.58 yen previously. The pound and Swiss franc
closed at 280.35 yen and 113.09 yen, respectively, down from
283.83 yen and 115.13 yen Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 147.38 yen, down from 147.47 at the close there Monday.
Meanwhile, the dollar was at 1.5658 marks.
   The market was "keeping an eye on what's coming out of the
Mideast" Monday but saw little of note, said Peter Connelly,
foreign-exchange manager for Wells Fargo Bank in San
Francisco. As a result, "the yen had a chance to catch up."
   By the end of global trading in New York, the dollar had
settled at 1.5650 marks, up from 1.5495 marks late Friday in
New York.
   The U.S. unit also rose to 1.2964 Swiss francs from 1.2830
francs late Friday. The mark and pound rose to 0.8282 franc
and 2.4789 francs, respectively, from 0.8271 franc and 2.4653
francs previously.
   Replacing the Swiss franc yesterday as the strongest
European performer was the British pound. Though it was lower
against the U.S. unit by the end of New York trading -- at
$1.9135, compared with $1.9225 late Friday -- the pound had
climbed to 2.9931 marks from 2.9807 marks.
   A value of three marks is thought to be the British
government's target level for entry into the exchange rate
mechanism of the European Monetary System.
   The pound's gains were all the more remarkable since many
investors entered the weekend with long sterling positions.
In recent months, market players have protected themselves
from a surprise Saturday or Sunday ERM entry by buying
sterling on Fridays and selling it on Mondays.
   But the second half of the operation was skipped this
time. ERM speculation was given a boost over the weekend by
British news reports focusing on entry as early as next
month. The days prior to the European Community's
intergovernmental conference in December were also mentioned
as a likely entry time.
   News that Iraq moved its Western hostages into military
installations as a shield against a U.S. attack, coupled with
a tongue-lashing of the Iraqi invaders by President Bush,
gave the dollar a lift soon after noon in New York.
   "No one wants to be short dollar for long" during the Gulf
crisis, said Robin Cheung, a vice president with Unibank in
New York.
   A dollar sell-off yesterday was forestalled by the general
opinion that today's credit-policy setting Federal Open
Market Committee meeting won't produce a vote for easier
money.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $410.10 an ounce, up 50 cents. Estimated
volume was a heavy five million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$410.45 an ounce.

   Bush Describes Americans
   Held by Iraq as `Hostages'

   Confrontation Is Escalating;
   U.S. Says Some Citizens
   Are Relocated in Kuwait

   President Bush said for the first time that Americans and
other Westerners detained in Iraq and Kuwait are hostages,
thereby elevating their importance -- and the stakes -- in
his confrontation with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   In a speech in Baltimore to the Veterans of Foreign Wars,
Mr. Bush said he had been "reluctant to use the term hostage"
in the past two weeks. "But," he said, "when Saddam Hussein
specifically offers to trade the freedom of those citizens of
many nations he holds against their will in return for
concessions, there can be little doubt that whatever these
innocent people are called, they are, in fact, hostages."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Faced with few options to protect Americans in Kuwait and
Iraq, the President warned: "I will hold the government of
Iraq responsible for the safety and well-being of American
citizens held against their will."
   Mr. Bush's rhetoric moved the U.S. a step closer to
hostilities with Iraq. By framing the issue so starkly, he
expanded the circumstances under which the U.S. would move
militarily against Baghdad -- and may have put himself in a
position in which he would be forced to react if harm comes
to Americans being detained.
   Hours after Mr. Bush spoke, the State Department said in
Washington that at least 12 Americans who had been staying in
hotels in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2, "have been
relocated by the Iraqis" to an unknown destination. State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said some of the U.S.
citizens "were taken with other, much larger groups of
foreigners."
   They may be going to Baghdad," a U.S. official added,
"That's something we presume."
   At least 35 other Americans in Kuwait were moved earlier
by the Iraqis, and their whereabouts remain unknown.
   A European diplomatic source in Washington said that
groups consisting of about 20 Westerners from different
nations apparently were being rounded up in Kuwait by the
Iraqis and were being moved at frequent intervals. The source
said much of the information his government was receiving was
vague and difficult to verify. But he said, "Our feeling is
the process has begun. People are being picked up and moved
around."
   Until now, the Bush administration had calculated that the
best chance for getting Americans and other Westerners out of
Iraq and Kuwait was to keep the spotlight off them and hope
that many could filter out or that an international
evacuation could be arranged quietly.
   Mr. Bush had been hoping to avoid an Iran-style hostage
crisis, in which U.S. policy would become handcuffed by
public fixation on the status of civilians caught up in the
standoff between Baghdad and Washington. But the change in
tactics by Mr. Bush, which came after a Sunday night White
House strategy session between the president and his top
aides, was prompted by Iraq's declaration that foreigners
were going to be used as a "shield" protecting Iraq from U.S.
and other Western military forces.
   According to Associated Press and Reuters reports, Iraq
said it had begun moving Western detainees to important
military sites that might become targets for U.S. bombs. The
reports quoted an Iraqi spokesman as saying, "Iraq's foreign
guests have been in fact moved to all vital and military
installations." U.S. officials were unable to confirm whether
the statement was accurate.
   Saddam Hussein also warned diplomats in Kuwait that if
they fail to close their embassies in Kuwait they would lose
their diplomatic immunity and be treated as any other
foreigners. There are about 130 diplomats in the U.S. Embassy
in Kuwait.
   Having chosen to focus on the hostages, Mr. Bush now faces
the same challenges that bedeviled former Presidents Carter
and Reagan in such circumstances. To satisfy Americans, he
will have to display concern for the hostages. Yet at the
same time, he will try to convince Saddam Hussein that he
won't back down from his demands or from his willingness to
use military might to enforce a United Nations trade embargo
on Iraq.
   While the hostage issue seems to complicate Mr. Bush's
planning, there isn't any sign that he is backing away from
his goals or that he is trying to leave Saddam Hussein a
face-saving way out of the crisis. In his VFW speech, the
president declared that U.S. objectives remain the "complete,
immediate and unconditional withdrawal" of Iraq from Kuwait;
the restoration of the ousted Kuwaiti government, and the
"security and the stability of Saudi Arabia and the Persian
Gulf."
   After his speech, Mr. Bush insisted that he wasn't
"turning up the heat" over the issue of detained Americans.
In remarks to reporters, he explained that he used the term
because Iraq linked freedom for the foreigners to a pullout
of U.S. and other troops from the region. Such demands "are
totally unsatisfactory to most countries in the world," Mr.
Bush said. "That can't stand."
   Mr. Bush said that the showdown with Iraq could be long
and that tough decisions remain to be made. The president is
likely to make one such decision today, activating some
military reservists. Estimates of the size of such a call-up
have ranged as high was 200,000, but the White House
indicated the figure would be smaller.
   In an apparent attempt to keep U.S. public opinion behind
his policy, Mr. Bush portrayed the growing U.S. presence in
the Gulf as a moral mission against aggression and an attempt
to defend U.S. friends, rather than a selfish effort to
protect the U.S. supply of cheap oil. In his 25-minute VFW
speech, his longest statement so far on the Gulf crisis, Mr.
Bush didn't mention the word "oil" once.
   Separately, the administration expressed concern that the
mounting tensions in the Persian Gulf could spill over into
other parts of the Middle East. The State Department said it
was permitting nonessential embassy personnel and dependents
in Jordan to leave that country if they wished, and it
advised other Americans to consider doing the same.
   An administration official explained that in view of
anti-U.S. demonstrations and Saddam Hussein's strong
influence in Jordan, "we're concerned about how the security
situation might evolve and decided it was appropriate to let
people leave."

   The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on
nationwide telephone interviews of 805 registered voters
conducted Saturday and Sunday by the polling organizations of
Peter Hart and Robert Teeter.
   The sample was drawn from 263 randomly selected geographic
points in the continental United States. Each region of the
country was represented in proportion to its population.
Households were selected by a method that gave all telephone
numbers, listed and unlisted, an equal chance of being
included. One registered voter, 18 years or older, was
selected from each household by a procedure to provide the
correct number of male and female respondents. The results of
the survey were minimally weighted by race and party
identification to assure that the poll accurately reflects
registered voters nationwide.

<TEXT>
   Chances are 19 of 20 that if all registered voters in the
U.S. had been surveyed using the same questionnaire, the
findings would differ from these poll results by no more than
3.5 percentage points in either direction. The margin of
error for subgroups would be larger.

   LONDON -- Lloyd's of London Underwriters Association
reduced the recommended marine hull insurance rates for the
Persian Gulf.
   A spokesman for the insurance firm said it cut recommended
rates because there hadn't yet been any serious incidents in
the Gulf. "But I'm sure if there are" any incidents in the
region, the rates will increase again, he added.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The rate for "hull and machinery" insurance for vessels
making calls at ports on the Persian Gulf coast of Saudi
Arabia, excluding the neutral zone between Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia, are now quoted at 0.75% of the insured value for
every seven days' cover, Lloyd's said. That rate is a
reduction from the previous level of 1%.
   Similarly, a 0.75% rate now applies to vessels making
calls to Iranian ports in the northern Persian Gulf, reduced
from 1% previously.
   Rates for ports on the coast of Iraq, Kuwait and the
neutral zone are still "held covered," which means they must
be negotiated on a voyage-by-voyage basis.
   Rates for vessels calling at other Persian Gulf ports and
at Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast ports are 0.20% of the insured
value, compared with the previous rate of 0.25%.
   The cost of insurance to the Gulf of Aqaba is unchanged at
0.25% of the insured value. All rates quoted are for seven
days' cover, Lloyd's said.

   EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE plans gain increasing favor, to help
control drug use.
   Rehabilitating drug users can make drug testing more
acceptable, by showing that firing or discipline isn't
inevitable, says John Tysse of the Labor Policy Association,
an employer group. Union Carbide's employee assistance
program went national in 1988. The program shines "a better
light" on testing; the company says it wouldn't test without
it. Boeing revises its policy to stress rehabilitation, not
just testing, to curb drug abuse.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consultant Towers Perrin says assistance programs are
gaining credibility for "detection and management" of drug
and other worker problems. Both Mobil and Campbell Soup
strongly emphasize counseling for drug users, but insist
they're not doing so in order to sell testing. Mobil moves
more vigorously to use its plan to stop and treat drug abuse.
Valley Bank says its supportive get-help policy has made drug
testing a "non-event" with employees.
   American Airlines says assistance plans are more effective
than testing in attempts to curb drug abuse.
                                                                                                       

   EMPLOYERS FEAR huge legal problems from new civil-rights
rules.
   If legislation due to emerge from Congress soon becomes
law, new punitive and other damages and jury trials would
spur litigation, says the Equal Employment Advisory Council,
an employer group. It says the bill, aimed at countering 1989
Supreme Court rulings that limited rights of plaintiffs in
race and sex discrimination cases, also promises "confusion"
over "well settled" issues. Labor attorney Victor Schachter
says employers will defensively resume "hiring by the
numbers."
   Banc One says it is preparing for any new law by making
sure it can prove lack of bias in hiring and firing. Keithley
Instruments, an electronics-gear firm, worries about zealous
enforcement. Bank of America says the law could boost many
firms' court costs, but not its own. A Bush veto could block
the bill, but many firms worry some version of it may become
law.
                                                                                                       

   FACTORY PRODUCTIVITY in the U.S. lags still more behind
other nations.
   Output per hour gained only 2% among U.S. manufacturers in
1989, exceeding only Sweden's 1.6% rise among 11 industrial
countries, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Nine other
nations topped the U.S., led by gains of 6.4% in Norway, 5.8%
in Japan and 5.1% in the United Kingdom. U.S. productivity
increases had tied for fifth among 12 nations from 1979
through 1987, but the U.S. rise in 1988 fell to 10th among
the 12.
   The U.S. has lost much of its cost advantage, too. Its
2.2% rise in unit labor costs was seventh among 13 nations
analyzed by the bureau, with the Netherlands, Norway and
France scoring cost declines. Korea's 13.6% rise was the
largest. In unit labor cost increases, the U.S. was 11th and
seventh among 14 countries in 1979-1987 and in 1988,
respectively.
   U.S. productivity won't keep up if U.S. workers aren't
trained to make decisions, the National Center on Education
and the Economy warns.
                                                                                                       

   THE THREAT OF WAR with Iraq may undercut industrial
unions' lobbying for a U.S. policy to cushion the impact of
military budget cuts on defense-plant workers. Machinists
union President George Kourpias is "scared stiff" that
legislators now won't listen, but he'll keep at it.
                                                                                                       

   THE BIG SLIDE: Labor unions in manufacturing suffered
their largest membership decline in three years in 1989, a
study by consultant Grant Thornton shows. Membership fell
3.2% to 4.6 million from 4.8 million, mainly due to rising
demand for people with high-tech skills and  a shrinking
market for low-tech workers, the most unionized, the firm
says.
                                                                                                       

   MASS LAYOFFS rose 14% in 1989 from 1988, with 2,762 layoff
actions reported, affecting 572,143 workers, the Bureau of
Labor Statistics said. But a separate BLS survey showed
worker displacement over five years from plant closings,
employers moving, staff cuts and like reasons easing by
300,000 from levels in a similar 1988 survey.
                                                                                                       

   ETHICS ARE LACKING in business, these working women
report.
   In a survey of 1,400 women by Working Woman magazine, from
52% to 70% said they've witnessed managers' lying to
employees, expense-account abuses at high levels, office

   East German Panel
   On Privatization
   Loses Its Director

   BONN -- Reiner Gohlke quit as director of the trust agency
responsible for privatizing East Germany's economy, raising
new speculation that the country is on the brink of economic
chaos.
   Mr. Gohlke, former head of West Germany's railways, said
he was leaving his post because of differences with fellow
board members over how best to fulfill the job. But West
German sources said Mr. Gohlke was increasingly impatient
with the unwillingness of Western industry to invest in the
East. Mr. Gohlke also has complained about resistance within
the East German trust agency, known as the Treuhandanstalt,
from holdover employees from the former communist government.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, the rapid collapse of East Berlin's government
continued with the withdrawal of the Social Democrats from
the post-communist ruling coalition. Analysts said that by
bolting, the Social Democrats would accelerate the move
toward formal German unity, currently expected by Dec. 2.
   The political crisis in East Berlin is likely to
fundamentally alter relations between the two German
governments. Until now, there seemed a good chance that the
two sides could get an agreement that maintained the illusion
of unifying two equal partners.
   But now that their government has crumbled, the East
Germans are likely to simply declare themselves out of
existence by joining the West. In that case, West German laws
would extend to East Germany and the country would be
governed by a set of interim regulations until formal unity
after the Dec. 2 all-German elections. And even that date
could be advanced: The Social Democrats are vowing to seek a
vote in the East German parliament this week to accelerate
German unity to mid-September.
   The resignation of Mr. Gohlke comes as doubts are growing
over the East German government's ability to carry through an
aggressive economic reform program. Having committed itself
to the ultimate goal of German unification, East Berlin is
hard-pressed to make difficult or unpopular decisions.
   "There's hardly any state authority left in East Berlin to
carry through on any decisions," said one West German
official. The resignation of Mr. Gohlke "is just another sign
of that weakness."
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere said Mr.
Gohlke would be succeeded by Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, head
of Hoesch AG, the big West German steel concern. Mr.
Rohwedder, a former official in Bonn's Finance Ministry,
already is head of the trust agency's supervisory board.
   Mr. Rohwedder met yesterday with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, presumably to discuss strategies for dealing
with East German economic problems.
   The trust agency is trying to determine which of East
Germany's 8,000 companies can be salvaged and is arranging
for temporary financing to allow most of the companies to
continue functioning.
   The two Germanys merged their economies on July 1, but
most East German companies appear unable to compete in the
new competitive environment without special assistance.

   Iraq's Not-So-Tough Army

   The average American reader would be hard pressed to know
whether the U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia are about to face the
Middle East equivalent of Rommel's vaunted Afrika Corps or
those of his bumbling Italian allies. Thus far, the
commentary has leaned toward the alarmist. U.S. News &amp; World
Report said on Aug. 13, "Iraq's huge tank army, operating in
open desert ideally suited to tank warfare, is a match for a
superpower." Other sources speak in wide-eyed awe of a
million "battle-hardened troops," supported by a massive
chemical weapons inventory, advancing under the protection of
planes flown, according to the Aug. 8 issue of the New York
Times, by "pilots whose skill and experience makes them the
most feared flyers in the Middle East."
   It's right to be cautious, but these press accounts sound
like descriptions of the Israeli army, not the Iraqi. Baghdad
fields a competent but limited extension of its mechanisms of
internal repression. This month marks only the second
anniversary of the formal end to the Iran-Iraq War -- a war
that was, in the words of strategic expert Lawrence Freedman
"a delicate balance of incompetence."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   True, the Iraqis have amassed a significant military
machine. But it is a giant with feet of clay -- which is why
Saddam is resorting to hostage-taking.
   -- Armor. Iraq has indeed "amassed 5,500 tanks, more than
Hitler had on the eve of the Nazi invasion of Poland" as U.S.
News reported, but at least 4,000 of those, according to the
International Institute for Strategic Studies, are outmoded
Soviet-made T-54/-55s and Chinese versions of the same tank.
Another 1,000 are Soviet T-62s, a better tank but one the
Israelis destroyed easily during the 1982 invasion of
Lebanon. Only the remaining 500 tanks can be classed as
modern types.
   -- Troops. Nearly half of Iraq's 1 million men are
mobilized reservists. They and their regular army
counterparts had their hands full countering the poorly
trained and equipped Iranians. Even when fighting on their
own territory, Iraqi troops surrendered in relatively large
numbers when the need (or opportunity) arose. Refugee reports
from Kuwait have not indicated a dramatic improvement in
troop morale or competence (though loot and rape have
apparently raised more than a few spirits).
   -- Chemical weapons. Iraq's substantial chemical inventory
has been used principally against unprepared troops and
unprotected civilians. It is a defensive weapon of limited
utility against a well-prepared, mobile foe. The Iranians
were able to counter it with masks and sometimes even wetted
handkerchiefs.
   -- Airpower. The Iraqi air arm turned in a decidedly
lackluster performance during the Iran-Iraq War. They were no
match for the Iranians in dogfights, and their close air
support of ground troops was largely ineffective. David Evans
and Richard Company, active duty U.S. officers writing in the
November 1984 issue of the Atlantic monthly, observed, " . .
. Iraqi pilots have dropped most of their bombs from 25,000
feet -- 24,000 feet too high for the pinpoint accuracy needed
to destroy tanks and artillery batteries." Iraqi pilots
improved -- but not by much -- as the war went on and the
Iranians proved unable to overcome their spare parts
shortages.
   In the Iran-Iraq war, the Iraqi army had difficulty
coordinating a limited advance against a weak, unprepared
foe. Time and again during the conflict, Baghdad displayed
shortcomings in military leadership that crippled its forces.
The overcentralized chain of command failed to make even the
most mundane tactical decisions in a timely and advantageous
manner. Inter-service and inter-arms coordination was
rudimentary. When success was achieved -- in one notable
engagement, the Iraqis were able to decimate a poorly
deployed Iranian armor division in a massive ambush conducted
from defensive positions -- the officers responsible were not
rewarded but shunted to the side, or even liquidated
outright.
   To Saddam Hussein, the military is a tool of repression
and threat. Military competence, if allowed to go too far,
would threaten his own position. So he deals with it in ways
reminiscent of Josef Stalin, who decimated his officer corps
on the eve of World War II. Only gradually, using time and
space, was Moscow able to rebuild a functioning military
machine. Saddam Hussein will have less time and less space.
   Saddam Hussein's military weakness has been compounded by
intelligence failure. The general form of Western, especially
U.S., response to an invasion of Kuwait was predictable. Iraq
had to act fast before the Americans arrived. Yet Saddam
repeated his costliest error of the Iran-Iraq War, when his
troops sat still after they reached their initial objectives.
The Iranians regrouped and drew the Iraqis into protracted
warfare.
   Saddam's Kuwait blunder may be even bigger. He picked the
most inappropriate time for an attack. A year ago, America
faced more strategic constraints from the Soviets. A year
from now, American forces may not be so numerous,
well-trained or well-equipped.
   Then, he bungled operationally. Halting after grabbing
Kuwait has provided the U.S. and its allies time for
reinforcement. And tactically, Iraq is in a lot of trouble.
The U.S. military has rebounded from its low point in the
waning days of the Vietnam War. It is a force constructed for
a war of movement. Its leadership, down through brigade
level, are "battle-hardened" too -- in the Vietnam War. Its
capabilities will be magnified by the complete control of the
air and seas it can expect to enjoy.
   Speculation concerning the need to break through Iraqi
defenses (at heavy cost) is misplaced. Kuwait will not be
liberated by slugging through that oil-rich chunk of land,
but rather by using U.S. mobility to strike across Iraqi
lines of communications toward the only strategic target of
consequence to the dictatorship, Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.

   LANCASTER, Pa. -- In October 1988, one of the world's most
successful corporate raiders and greenmailers set its sights
on a sleepy maker of floor coverings located here among the
peaceful Pennsylvania Dutch. For the Belzbergs, Armstrong
World Industries Inc. looked like mighty easy prey.
   The Belzbergs were, after all, the Canadian financiers who
had over the past decade made more than $250 million buying
stakes in more than a dozen companies and threatening to take
them over. The fearful target then generally offered the
family a big premium, or greenmail, to go away, or found
another bidder to buy the Belzbergs out.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Family chief Samuel Belzberg, 62, is such a tough operator
that he mounted a successful takeover of Scovill Inc. the
week before Christmas in 1984, and the next year threatened
Arvin Industries Inc. with a takeover bid on Christmas Eve
itself.
   The Belzbergs were investors both in Ivan F. Boesky &amp; Co.,
headed by the legendary arbitrager and inside trader, and in
Jamie Securities Co., run by recently convicted securities
felon John Mulheren, at whose trial Sam testified as a
character witness.
   Sam's son Marc, increasingly the family's lead player in
the takeover game, was found by a federal court in Washington
to have illegally concealed the family's ownership of Ashland
Oil Co. shares during a takeover fight for that company in
1986. A Belzberg unit paid $3.1 million to settle this civil
suit and a related case.
   Marc once expressed his business philosophy to a seminar
at his alma mater, Yeshiva University, according to a friend
who attended: "In your personal life, you meet someone and
give them the benefit of the doubt, bring them to your house,
serve them a meal; if you do that in the business world,
you'll get robbed." Mr. Belzberg says he doesn't remember the
talk.
   It was with a similar spirit of good will that the
Belzbergs went after Armstrong with a public takeover
proposal in July of 1989. In May of this year, the 10-month
battle ended and the Belzbergs, true to form, sold their
shares. But this time, no greenmail was paid: The Belzbergs
lost about $13.6 million.
   The story of how one of the last of the greenmailers went
down to defeat says a lot about the business conditions with
which the '90s have begun. Without enough equity behind them
and with junk bonds no longer considered a proper or readily
available substitute, the Belzbergs were nothing more than a
paper tiger against the then $2.3 billion Armstrong, a
company the Belzbergs would have easily been able to gobble
up or greenmail just two years earlier. What's more, their
once-successful relationship with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
and their history as greenmailers weakened the Belzberg's
reputation with the rest of Wall Street, as well as with the
shareholders and legislators who came to Armstrong's defense.
   The Belzbergs, who include Sam's brothers Hyman, 66, and
William, 58, and who have a combined estimated net worth of
$400 million, seem to have learned a lesson from the
experience. Although none of the Belzbergs would be
interviewed for this article, Sam Belzberg acknowledged in an
April interview with this newspaper: "Business is a little
bit tough right now." Adds Gordon Lancaster, executive vice
president of the Belzbergs' main holding company, First City
Financial Co., "The hostile, high-profile, newsworthy,
headline-making transaction is gone. Sam says the new First
City will be really boring."
   The Belzbergs, who first made their money in furniture,
real estate investing and oil and gas leases, may come to
relish boredom, as right now, the Armstrong failure isn't the
only problem in their far-flung empire.
   Far West Financial Corp., a Los Angeles-based savings and
loan that is 54.2%-owned by the Belzbergs, needs at least
$130 million of new capital to prevent a federal takeover,
which seems more likely since regulators rejected a
recapitalization plan last week. Far West was a major
purchaser of junk bonds, which have dragged its net worth
down perilously close to insolvency. As with many other big
clients, Drexel Burnham's Michael Milken not only sold the
Belzberg empire junk bonds, but he also raised money from
junk sales to others to finance the family's raiding
operations. "Far West is a typical Drexel-Milken daisy chain
thrift," says Kenneth Thomas, a Miami-based thrift analyst.
   First City, the family's Vancouver-based flagship, also
has problems. In recent years, gains on securities trading
and investments generated the largest part share of its
earnings.
   Such gains will probably be slimmer in the post-takeover
era. First City plans to close its New York arbitrage
operation, which invests in takeover stocks; an associate
cites losses on UAL Inc. and Hilton Hotels Corp. First City
also blamed "volatile markets" and losses on arbitrage for a
sharp drop in first-quarter earnings. The results followed a
20.7 million Canadian dollar loss for the fourth quarter of
1989, owing to loss provisions on unspecified investments.
   First City's 5.6% stake in Britain's Asda Group PLC, a big
retailer, is now worth roughly $44 million less than what the
Belzbergs paid for it, according to a Toronto analyst's
estimate.
   And recently, Sam Belzberg sold First City's nine-seat
Challenger jet plane for about $7 million in a cost-cutting
move.
   When the Belzbergs first began making secret purchases of
Armstrong shares in late 1988, the target clearly looked ripe
for the picking. The home-products market was going through a
big period of consolidation, and Armstrong had strong market
share and good earnings, and was affordable. "We were on
everybody's takeover screens," says the company's soft-spoken
chairman, William Adams.
   In some ways, however, the Belzbergs' effort seemed
ill-fated from the start. Shortly after they began acquiring
Armstrong shares, their investment bank, Drexel, agreed to
plead guilty to six federal felony charges. In March of 1989,
when the Belzbergs owned 4% of Armstrong, their financier,
Mr. Milken, was indicted on racketeering and various
securities-law violations. As Drexel began sputtering toward
its eventual bankruptcy-law filing earlier this year, market
professionals suspected that the Belzbergs were losing much
of their effectiveness.
   "They were nothing more than spearcarriers for Drexel,"
says Guy Wyser-Pratte, arbitrage chief at PrudentialBache
Securities, who believes the Belzbergs couldn't do a big deal
without Drexel's help.
   Soon, the Belzbergs' secret stock purchases soared above
$15 million in value, and the government had to be notified
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law. The Belzbergs'
filing put the Armstrong camp on alert.
   Mr. Adams, 56, the thin and bespectacled Armstrong chief,
proved in many ways a sharp contrast to the ruddy-faced,
stocky Belzberg family boss. Sam Belzberg is an art collector
and inveterate international traveler, a competitive
sportsman and a big fan of professional boxing.
   Mr. Adams is a lifelong Armstrong employee who is so
punctilious he records his hole-by-hole golf scores on his
home computer.
   But unlike those who had quickly capitulated under a
Belzberg merger offer, Mr. Adams quickly dismissed the idea.
The Belzbergs proposed a merger in July of 1989, announcing
that they had amassed a menacing 9.85% of Armstrong's shares.
Armstrong did offer to buy back the Belzbergs' stake, but
only at the current market price, with no premium. The
Belzbergs, in a declaration of war, refused.
   By last fall, the junk-bond market and Drexel Burnham were
reeling, so the Belzbergs searched Wall Street for other
sources of cash to finance a takeover battle. Numerous
investment and commercial banks declined to help, a former
First City executive says. First City's Mr. Lancaster says
financing commitments were lined up at one point in the
summer of 1989, but they lapsed.
   And then Armstrong struck back. Already protected with
plenty of anti-takeover armor, the company went further: It
put 10% of its stock in the hands of a new employee stock
ownership plan. It also sought from the Pennsylvania
legislature the toughest anti-takeover bill in the country --
and saw it ceremoniously signed into law in Lancaster three
days before Armstrong's annual meeting in April.
   Under that law, a raider selling his stake in a
Pennsylvania company within 18 months of making a bid to
control it has to turn over any profits from the deal to the
company he was raiding. The law also specifically allows a
target company's directors to reject a takeover bid even if
the bid seems in the best interest of the target company's
shareholders, as long as the directors believe other
"stakeholders," such as the employees, would be hurt.
   For the Belzbergs, the Pennsylvania takeover law packed a
double wallop: Not only did it make a hostile bid for
Armstrong more difficult, but the controversy surrounding the
law helped stall the company's stock price, making it
impossible for the Belzbergs to sell their Armstrong shares
at a profit. "Whatever takeover premium that might have
existed a year ago was beaten out by the mere proposal" of
the law, complains an adviser to the Belzbergs.
   With the costs of maintaining their more than $170 million
stake mounting -- they borrowed money to buy some of the
shares -- the Belzbergs had time for one final maneuver: They
would go right to the Armstrong shareholders, seeking to
unseat four of the 13 directors. The proxy fight, if
successful, would pave the way for a Belzberg takeover of
Armstrong.
   But here the Belzbergs' reputation caught up to them. Some
of the large institutional investors that controlled 60% of
Armstrong remembered all too well how the Belzbergs had cost
them money before, by accepting greenmail. In such cases, the
Belzbergs made a big profit by selling their shares in a
particular company, but the sudden removal of the Belzberg
takeover threat usually caused the target company's shares to
plunge in value.
   "Greenmail, of course, is anathema to us," says Jim
Ullman, a portfolio strategist at Batterymarch Financial
Management, which owned about 1 million Armstrong shares at
the time of the proxy fight. Batterymarch says it was burned
in the Belzbergs' greenmail play at Ashland. "Greenmail, on
the face of it, is inequitable. It almost amounts to
stealing," Mr. Ullman says.
   Sam Belzberg said in the April interview that "I don't
know what greenmail is." But he added that the family no
longer accepts a buy-out of its investment shares at a
premium not available to other shareholders.
   The Belzbergs did get some expressions of sympathy from
some big holders who disliked the Pennsylvania anti-takeover
law, but it wasn't nearly enough.
   Armstrong's management, meanwhile, had done a decent job
with the company, given the industry's cyclical nature.
First-quarter results were particularly encouraging. Profits
from continuing operations, excluding unusual items, rose 30%
to $40.7 million or 86 cents a share.
   At the April 30 shareholder vote, the Belzbergs won enough
ballots to seat only Michael Jensen, a professor of business
administration at Harvard who is widely seen as a
shareholder-rights champion.
   A chastened Sam Belzberg decided to bail out. On May 30,
the family sold its entire stake, three-quarters of it to
Armstrong, for about $171.5 million, about $18 million less
than the family paid for it. Though settlements of
outstanding lawsuits with Armstrong later won the Belzbergs
another $4.4 million, they had lost the long battle, and
ended, at least for the foreseeable future, their days as a
raider.
   The Belzbergs say they are shifting their focus to West
Coast real estate and environmental services as two potential
growth areas.
   Mr. Lancaster says First City also is now busy chasing
friendly but smaller deals, often involving assets that
debt-ridden companies need to unload. But he acknowledges
that First City isn't likely to be able to sustain the
profits it reaped from its '80s-style raids. And Sam Belzberg
is no longer talking of building a giant industrial empire.
   Instead, one of his current passions involves a big
underground reservoir in the Colorado desert, where he and
his partners have acquired a large chunk of land. They hope
to tap the reservoir to sell water to Denver residents.
   But once again, opponents are lining up against the
Belzbergs: Ranchers are worried about their wells going dry,
and a group of self-styled New Age mystics that live in the
area are also opposed. Says Belzberg aide Mr. Lancaster,
"Every environmentalist, every Indian band, every Tom, Dick,
and Harry is going to be involved in this."

   Thornton Wilder's "Our Town" is a delightful piece of
fiction . . . and so was your recent July 30 page-one article
about Peterborough, N.H.
   Your selection of sources resulted in a distinctly
one-sided portrayal of the town's relationship with Minebea
Co., owner of the New Hampshire Ball Bearing plant here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The tone of the piece, in fact, reflected a preconceived
bias against small towns and their adjustments to changes in
management of local companies. Further, it was written in the
unfortunate tradition of Japan-bashing articles that have
become all too popular in recent years.
   The article implied NHBB is strictly bottom-line-oriented,
having little interest in the community, but this is not
borne out by the facts. The company has been actively
involved in community and regional affairs for years.
   Certainly there are adjustments to be made under the new
ownership, but change is inevitable with the passage of time
and evolving business conditions.
   Let's keep Thornton Wilder's work as great entertainment
and let the Peterboroughs of the nation find their way of
dealing with new management in their vital industries.

   Peterborough's business community is much more than just
Minebea's NH Ball Bearings subsidiary. There is certainly a
small-town flavor that natives and more recent arrivals
cherish. I've enjoyed this community since moving here in
1975 as founding editor and co-owner of my first major
magazine, BYTE. Numerous businesses large and small find this
kind of small town quite acceptable.
   Our town's publishing industry alone employs hundreds of
people. Our economy is much more balanced than a single
manufacturing company recently acquired by new owners.
Peterborough, N.H., co-exists with and trades quite well with
a global world of commerce.

   MONTREAL -- One of Canada's two main East-West railroad
lines reopened and the second was expected to reopen soon.
   Government-owned Canadian National Railways said freight
began moving Sunday night on a segment of its
transcontinental route in northern Ontario. The track had
been blocked for a week by native Indian protesters who were
seeking action on land claims and other issues.

   Meanwhile, Canadian Pacific Ltd. said its CP Rail unit
obtained a court injunction ordering a separate group of
Indians to end a blockade on a segment of its main
transcontinental route. A CP Rail spokesman said he couldn't
say when the track would reopen but added that the railroad
is confident the Indians will obey the injunction. The CP
Rail blockade began last Thursday.

   CHICAGO -- Just over a year after the Chicago Board of
Trade, suspecting an attempt to corner the market, ordered
large traders to liquidate positions in soybean futures
contracts, rumors about a possible similar attempt are
circulating in the soybean oil futures pit.
   ADM Investor Services, the futures trading division of the
huge grain processing firm Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., has
amassed a large position in soybean oil futures contracts,
traders said. The firm also is thought to hold more than half
of all receipts for delivery of soybean oil based on July and
August futures contracts, which show ownership of the oil
stored in warehouses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The price of the soybean oil futures contract for August
delivery settled at 24.36 cents a pound yesterday, up 0.11
cent.
   Talk on the floor of the Chicago exchange yesterday was
that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Board of
Trade's business conduct committee are investigating whether
ADM has a legitimate business reason for its holdings. A
spokeswoman for Archer-Daniels-Midland in Decatur, Ill.,
declined to comment. A Board of Trade spokesman also had no
comment.
   "Something's going on," said one prominent Board of Trade
member who asked not to be identified. "I'm sure it's in the
hands of the business conduct committee, and they're very
secretive about what they do."
   The CFTC routinely monitors firms with large positions in
any futures contracts as the contracts near expiration. It
was doing just that in July 1989, when Ferruzzi Finanziaria
S.p.A. came close to cornering the market in U.S. soybeans.
At the time, Ferruzzi owned contracts for 23 million bushels
of soybeans, but there were only 12 million bushels available
for convenient delivery.
   If Ferruzzi had tried to take delivery of all the soybeans
for which it had contracts, prices would have risen sharply
and some traders might have been forced to default on their
commitments to deliver the grain. The CFTC ordered Ferruzzi
to reduce its holdings by 20 million bushels, and the Board
of Trade followed suit by laying out a schedule under which
large traders had to liquidate their positions.
   Theoretically, controlling a majority of all available
soybean oil would give ADM similar influence over the price
of soybean oil futures contracts. But it's unclear what, if
any, steps the CFTC or Board of Trade has taken to curb the
company's control.
   Some traders speculated yesterday that the U.S. will
extend additional credit to the Soviet Union this fall to buy
grain, as soon as the country clears up emigration
restrictions on Soviet Jews. "That would make ADM's position
worth a whole lot of money," one analyst said.
   Others worry that ADM has no economic reason to hold its
warehouse receipts for soybean oil and may be attempting to
corner the market. Other grain-processing and trading firms
have complained to the Board of Trade and the CFTC about
ADM's holdings.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures prices edged higher, while
those of silver and platinum fell. December delivery gold
ended with a gain of 50 cents an ounce at $418.80 after
trading in a range of more than $5, from $414.80 to $420.10.
December silver slipped five cents an ounce to $5.2620, and
October platinum declined $3.30 an ounce to $504.10. Gold
traders concentrated on oil's inflationary potential,
ignoring the dollar's strength against European currencies.
As a result, gold fluctuated "tick for tick" with oil, said
William O'Neill, senior futures strategist for Merrill Lynch.
It became known over the weekend that the Soviet Union sold
an estimated 75 tons, or about 2.4 million ounces, of gold
last week, according to Mr. O'Neill. "This may account for
some of the sluggishness in the market last week, when it
seemed that a firmer tone was warranted by the tense Middle
Eastern situation," he said. On the other hand, the market
showed an ability to absorb a large quantity of producer
selling and not break as it did when big Saudi Arabian sales
hit the market a few months ago, he said. About the only
negative factor in precious metals, the analyst said, is that
silver and platinum are experiencing little if any demand for
bullion. Platinum also has failed to react to tribal fighting
and tensions in South Africa, the world's leading producer,
he said.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices eased. October delivery sugar was
off 0.12 cent a pound at 11.28 cents. It traded as high as
11.41 cents before encountering selling, primarily
profit-taking from recent advances, one analyst said. She
said that China again was reported to be buying sugar in the
world market, but once this buying was out of the way no
other large orders were in prospect. China bought an
estimated 40,000 tons of sugar, bringing its purchases in
recent weeks to between 250,000 and 300,000 tons, the analyst
said. Another analyst said that although sugar futures
rebounded recently from a sharp drop, there still isn't any
fundamental reason for concern over supplies. In fact, this
analyst said, indications are that output will jump in the
1990-91 season that will begin Sept. 1.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices rose. The October delivery was up
1.09 cents a pound to 71.73 cents, and December cotton
advanced 0.89 cent to 70.10 cents. The October contract found
support that enabled it to rebound and offset last week's
declines, which were due to recession concerns related to the
Middle East crisis, analyst Thomas Mueller of Merrill Lynch
said. The recovery began late last week as the market
divorced itself from the Mideast situation and stock market
weakness, he said. Over the weekend, strong Far Eastern
demand developed for cotton in the cash market, which helped
boost prices, the analyst said. Separately, Louisiana, the
third largest cotton-producing state in the Mississippi
Delta, may not produce as much cotton as expected, according
to Mr. Mueller. The tops of the cotton plants are suffering
from prolonged dry weather in the state, he said. As a
result, Louisiana may produce about 1.1 million bales during
the 1990-91 season that began Aug. 1, or about 100,000 fewer
than expected earlier, Mr. Mueller said. Louisiana, unlike
Mississippi, hasn't had any significant rainfall in about a
month, he said.

   CHINA'S BUDGET DEFICIT

   China unveiled figures showing its budget deficit for this
year is widening.
   Government spending climbed 16.4% in the first seven
months this year, outpacing an 11.6% rise in revenue, said
the China Daily, quoting the State Statistical Bureau. The
official newspaper didn't give specific budget figures for
the period.
   The official projection for the 1990 budget has set the
deficit for this year at the equivalent of $1.8 billion,
narrowed from $1.9 billion in 1989. But economists said the
reduction was unlikely to be achieved. "The lower deficit
called for in the budget is now looking increasingly
optimistic," one foreign economist said.
   The newspaper didn't say why spending was rising, but it
noted that profits of state companies slid 20% in the first
seven months of the year. Last year, subsidies to keep prices
artificially low and to bail out inefficient state companies
accounted for one-third of government spending.
                                                                                                       

   EC ANTI-DUMPING ACTIONS
                                                                                                       

   The European Community opened an investigation into
imports of disposable Japanese lighters. The EC also said it
will reconsider a decision, announced in January, to end
anti-dumping duties that were imposed in 1985 on hydraulic
excavators from Japan.

   Israeli environmentalists won a temporary injunction
barring the Voice of America from building a
radio-transmitter complex in the Negev desert until
environmental questions are answered. Last month, a
government planning board approved the billion-dollar project
aimed at broadcasting programs of the Voice of America and
Radio Liberty.

   Vietnam will send a delegation to South Korea next month
to discuss economic cooperation, the first official visit
since before the Vietnam War, officials in Seoul said. South
Korean business groups have expressed interest in mining and
in building small factories in Vietnam to take advantage of
cheap labor costs.

   A brother-in-law of Philippine President Corazon Aquino
launched a movement to pressure Swiss authorities to return
millions of dollars allegedly stolen by the late President
Ferdinand Marcos and deposited in Switzerland. Sen. Agapito
Aquino said he formed the "Swiss Watch" organization because
the government had failed to recover the money through court
actions. The Aquino government has accused Mr. Marcos of
stealing up to $10 billion from the national treasury during
his 20-year rule.

   Philippine President Corazon Aquino said she will attend
Emperor Akihito's enthronement rites in Japan in November, as
scheduled, despite domestic problems and new coup threats
against her government. . . . The Matterhorn claimed the life
of a mountain guide for the first time in 39 years when a
Swiss guide and a U.S. climber fell to their deaths.

   This Government
   In Exile Is Poles
   Apart From Warsaw

   A Retired Accountant Keeps
   The Polish State Alive --
   And Free of Communists

   LONDON -- Overthrown in 1939 through the connivance of
Hitler and Stalin, the legitimately elected government of
Poland packed up its state seals and the handwritten original
of its constitution and decamped to Romania. After a stop in
France and some complications involving communism, it
established itself here, in a posh corner house with a
cream-painted portico at 43 Eaton Place. It is still at the
same address 51 years later, and in no hurry to move home.
   "You can have a very long tenancy," says Bohdan Wendorff,
Head of Chancellery and undersecretary in the Ministry of
Justice. "We've got this building until 2044."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Wendorff, who is 86 years old, sits at his desk in the
front office on a quiet Tuesday, finishing a cheese sandwich.
(The government meets on Mondays and Wednesdays.) On a table
behind him, the day's mail awaits opening: Polish newspapers
from the United States and Australia, the phone bill, an
official-looking envelope marked, "Urgent Reply Requested.
Open Now. #5,000 Cash Prize."
   When war broke out, Mr. Wendorff was a county clerk in
Poland's Interior Ministry. He escaped to join Poland's Army
in France, then served under British command and in 1945
became aide-de-camp to the first president of the Polish
Government in Exile. His 18 fellow ministers and
undersecretaries all fled, too, and suffered the war's
ordeals -- imprisoned in Siberia, embattled at Tobruk -- and
the indignity of its outcome for Poland. As a point of honor,
they vowed never to set foot in their homeland until it was
free.
   "I know everything about protocol," Mr. Wendorff says as
he rummages through a cabinet and pulls out the state seals;
they look like brass doorknobs. "I've got the constitution
upstairs," he says, going away for a few minutes and coming
back with a large cardboard folder. He opens it to pages of
faded Polish pen strokes from 1935. "Of course it will go
back to Poland. Our president will bring it back for the new
president -- when he's elected."
   A man by the name of Wojciech Jaruzelski, currently
residing at Belwedere Palace in Warsaw, labors under the
impression that he is president of Poland. On that detail,
Mr. Wendorff begs to differ. His president is Ryszard
Kaczorowski, a retired accountant currently hard at work in
the top-floor office of "the castle," the exiles' name for 43
Eaton Place.
   Warsaw's new leaders have renamed the country to conform
with the brass plate on the castle's front door: Republic of
Poland, it has always read. And they have crowned the eagle
in the national emblem to match the one on Mr. Wendorff's
mantle. But the exiles are fussy. The election of 1989 that
empowered Solidarity and finished communism was rigged to
spare some of the communists. Until a free vote expels them
all, the constitution stays here.
   "As far as we're concerned, Jaruzelski belongs in court,
not in the presidency," says Jerzy Kozniewski, who is finance
minister and also in the travel business. At 63, he is the
government's youngest member. "What exists there now is not a
sovereign country. We are still the true voice of independent
Poland. We are the mouthpiece."
   It is a busy Monday. The ministries of Military Matters,
Emigre Affairs, Education and Culture -- half a dozen people
-- are meeting around the long mahogany table in the cabinet
room. At the finance ministry (a small back office) Mr.
Kozniewski sits beside the green-metal safe while his
bureaucracy, one elderly man named Marek Swieszkowski,
shuffles accounts at the desk.
   "Things have gotten more difficult for us," Mr. Kozniewski
admits, since Solidarity formed a government of its own. In
simpler days of tyranny, Poland's opposition made 43 Eaton
Place a regular stop on trips west. But when Lech Walesa and
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki came to London this year,
they had to snub the Government in Exile, lest their
authority (and Gen. Jaruzelski's) be cast into doubt. It has
put a slight edge on life at the castle.
   "You'd think they invented the idea that Poland could be
free," Mr. Kozniewski says. "They're grateful, but they want
to make us a footnote in history. To return sovereignty now
would be nonsense. We waited half a century. We can wait
another year."
   The finance minister jumps up. He's forgotten about his
parking meter. Mr. Swieszkowski opens a strongbox, extends a
credit from the state treasury, and Mr. Kozniewski rushes
out.
   Back in Warsaw, politicians are slinging mud in
anticipation of the fully free election they all want. Mr.
Walesa's backers for the presidency insist that Gen.
Jaruzelski quit right now. They want a presidential election
this fall, and they're fuming at the U.S. for inviting the
general to Washington in October. The government isn't so
eager for a change so soon, and the issue has split
Solidarity.
   The exiles, meanwhile, carry ahead with the same "air of
unreality," as historian Norman Davies has written, that
"would hang over the government of Churchill and Atlee if it
had been forced to leave London for Ottawa in 1940, as
envisaged, and if its successors had been prevented from
returning ever since by a gang of Stalinist usurpers."
   For the Poles who flew with the Royal Air Force in the
Battle of Britain and fought beside Montgomery's Army at
Monte Cassino, the war ended in betrayal. They and the Free
French had been the only occupied allies to struggle on. Yet
at Yalta in 1945, Roosevelt and Churchill handed Poland to
the Soviets. Stalin promised to hold democratic elections,
but he didn't.
   Poland's government in London lost its status, and its
claim to a seat at the UN. Like 144,000 Polish soldiers and
their families, it chose to stay in Britain, and to preserve
the republic in exile. Its leaders called the deal at Yalta a
"monstrous injustice which could not possibly last."
   But it did, and the government that started as a stopgap
became a full-time state of fantasy.
   To fill in for parliament, dissolved in 1939, emigres
around the world elected a National Council. They still do,
every five years; 100,000 voted in 1989, two months before
Solidarity won at home. And to make up for the gold reserves
snatched by Warsaw, the finance ministry raises $250,000 a
year through "voluntary taxation."
   The National Council's 110 members meet here every two
months, or in Toronto or Chicago, to chew over the prime
minister's budget: $35,000 to publish the official gazette;
$1,480 for the president's postage; $3,700 for the foreign
minister's typist; $1,390 for coffee and wine. They never
fail to approve the prime minister's permanent program: to
remind the world that his government exists.
   Crisis has flared once. In 1972, some prewar political
parties judged that President August Zaleski, in office 25
years, had served long enough. He left, and a "Unified
Political Center" resolved that the president, who appoints
the prime minister, should pass the torch every seven years
to a new head of state accepted by an exile consensus.
   Four men have since accepted "responsibility before God
and history for the destinies of the state," as the
constitution enjoins. Ryszard Kaczorowski would like to be
the last.
   Silver-haired and pinstriped, he sits at a fine-grained
desk in an office as presidential as they come: crystal
chandeliers, Persian carpets, gilt ceiling, and a portrait
gallery of presidents past.
   On July 19 last year, he took the oath of office. It was
the day his predecessor, Kazimierz Sabbat, died in London --
and the day another oath was taken, in Warsaw, by Wojciech
Jaruzelski.
   "Perhaps," says President Kaczorowski, "it was God's
hand."
   He had been Home Minister of the Government in Exile,
keeping up contacts with the Polish underground, just as the
London Government stood behind the underground he joined in
1939 as a 20-year-old in Bialystok. The Soviets arrested him,
condemned him to death, changed their minds and sent him to
Siberia. He went on to fight in Italy, and to take up the
emigres' vigil here.
   "A lot of people thought our existence was ridiculous," he
says. "But sometimes they forget about the moral value of
symbols. I hope to return to Poland, and not as a private
citizen. A freely elected parliament might invite me to
transfer our sovereignty. It might only be for hours, but for
that time I would be president of Poland -- in Warsaw."

   Dallas and Fort Worth enjoy a reputation as the nation's
best location for industry. There's nothing wrong with that
to the extent that it means first-class public services at
reasonable cost, or cutting red tape. But in one glaring
instance Dallas's "pro-business" leadership has succumbed to
the "what's good for General Motors is good for Detroit"
fiction. The city is even engaging in a costly exercise in
corporate socialism.
   This example of private interest superseding the public
good has its roots in 1974, when Dallas-Fort Worth opened as
a regional airport. It was built to take over regional
traffic from Dallas's older municipal airport, Love Field. In
1979, then Fort Worth Congressman and House Majority Leader
Jim Wright secured legislation, now known as the Wright
Amendment, to restrict commercial air traffic at Love Field.
The amendment limited Love Field traffic to origins and
destinations within Texas or four contiguous states. The
rationale was twofold: to nurture the new Dallas-Fort Worth
Airport until it could stand on its own and to allay Fort
Worth's fears that Dallas was not seriously committed to the
newer airport.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stated rationale aside, the appropriate question to ask
with respect to such protection is, cui bono? Obviously, DFW
Airport has been a major beneficiary of the "infant industry"
protections accorded by the Wright Amendment: In the 11 years
since the amendment's passage, DFW has become the nation's
second-busiest airport and is projected to surpass Chicago's
O'Hare as the world's busiest within five years. The
amendment's restrictions have also promoted Fort Worth-based
American Airlines' dominance of DFW while allowing
Dallas-based Southwest Airlines to carve out a profitable
niche at Love. In fact, Southwest is Love's sole carrier.
   Anyone who has passed through DFW of late knows this
heavily congested airport no longer needs the "protection" of
the Wright Amendment. But passengers originating in or
connecting through DFW desperately need protection from the
inflated airfares that result from a federally sanctioned
duopoly (of American and Delta) at DFW and monopoly at Love
Field. For example, a recent Department of Transportation
study, which concluded generally that airline deregulation
has been a boon to travelers, also observed that typical
fares at DFW are 15% to 20% higher than the national norm. A
1989 Federal Trade Commission investigation found that
passengers at both airports would reap lower airfares and
experience fewer flight delays if the restrictions at Love
were repealed.
   In turn, last year Rep. Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) and Sen.
Nancy Kassebaum (R., Kan.) sponsored bills to repeal the
Wright Amendment. Neither bill went anywhere; Mr. Glickman's
was stymied in the House Aviation Subcommittee, whose
membership includes Rep. Pete Geren (D., Texas) from Jim
Wright's former district, while the Senate opted to steer
clear of what it perceived to be a local matter.
   Nonetheless, encouraged by these efforts and recognizing
Love Field as an underutilized asset that could contribute to
the city's economic development, the Dallas City Council --
Love's governing body -- last fall passed a resolution
supporting replacement of the Wright Amendment. It advocated
extending the airport's perimeter limit to 650 miles -- a
reach as far north as Omaha and as far east as Nashville. Not
surprisingly, officials in neighboring Fort Worth went
ballistic, accusing Dallas of reneging on a sacrosanct
agreement thought of as the basis for regional cooperation.
   Sensing a groundswell in Dallas for modification of the
Wright Amendment -- and a challenge to its position --
American Airlines' Chairman Robert Crandall then weighed in.
First he demanded access to 11 gates at Love Field and
promised 200 flights daily out of the airport. Then he
threatened to cancel plans to build a new terminal at DFW.
The former was effective in heightening neighboring
residents' noise and safety fears, while the latter indelibly
identified American's interests with those of DFW Airport
and, more important, the entire North Texas region. Last, but
not least, American convinced virtually every public and
civic group in North Texas to lobby against the City
Council's effort to open access to Love Field.
   Southwest Airlines, meanwhile, this spring broke its
long-standing silence to propose to the City Council a
self-serving "compromise" that would not only preserve the
Wright Amendment restrictions -- and the airline's Love Field
monopoly -- but also permit direct and connecting flights
beyond Texas's four contiguous states. Not surprisingly, a
majority of the City Council caved in under American's
full-court press and rescinded its resolution endorsing the
650-mile perimeter.
   How does the City Council justify its decision? Mainly
with the weak excuse that it's the "pro-business" thing to
do: American is a major employer and contributes mightily to
the regional economy. Half-apologetically, Mayor Annette
Strauss has been heard to quip with reference to American:
"Where does a 2,000-pound gorilla sit? Anywhere he wants to."
The unspoken and less humorous reality of the situation,
however, is that Dallas has meekly agreed to perpetuate an
outdated legislative relic that restricts competition, limits
choices, hinders local economic development and imposes undue
costs on the flying public across the nation.
   The Love Field matter could be quickly resolved by
Congress, but Washington's self-styled paladins of free
enterprise, including several from the Texas delegation,
apparently don't have the stomach for a fight that would
displease the nation's largest and most powerful airline.
Ultimately, air travelers must seek redress in court -- the
only place, it seems, where public policy is made these days.

   In your July 18 article "Rivalry Accelerates for Sports
Trucks, Dubbed Family Sedans of the '90s," you are right when
you say that several years ago Jeep Cherokee virtually owned
the market. I had a pickup for years but needed four doors
once I had kids. In late 1987 the only four doors were Jeep
and the Isuzu Trooper. I made a big mistake and bought the
Trooper. It has been a maintenance nightmare. I've spent
almost $3,000 on repairs and it has been in the shop more
than 65 days in the past two years (I once had to wait 12
days for a thermostat housing gasket).
   If Joe Isuzu is going after the upscale Range Rover
market, all I can say is Good Luck]

   Tokyo Shares Decline in Very Thin Trading;

   Tokyo stocks finished lower in extremely thin trading.
Prices were pushed up and down largely by arbitrage trading
amid few participants on the market.
   In London, the crisis in the Persian Gulf continued to
take its toll, as U.K. shares again closed sharply lower,
albeit above intraday minimums.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo trading was quiet, except for some test buying
midday by some individuals and dealers who were trading for
their own accounts. Mainly, investors remained on the
sidelines without new developments in the Middle East.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 296.25 points to
26490.47. Volume on the first section was estimated at 200
million shares, the lowest daily volume since January 1986,
traders said. Friday, 290 million shares changed hands.
Decliners outnumbered gainers 653 to 246, while 187 issues
were unchanged.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index was up
319.17 to 26809.64.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was down 10.32 points Monday, or 0.51%, at
2022.98.
   The second section index dropped 24.01 points, or 0.59%,
to 4048.24. Volume in the section was estimated at seven
million shares, down from 13 million shares Friday.
   The Nikkei Index, which opened the day at 26759 points,
fluctuated in a range of 26456 to 26923. Traders said that
just a small amount of buy or sell orders was able to move
the index because of the thin overall volume.
   Stocks declined from midday gains to close slightly above
intraday lows. Traders said, however, that they saw the
market regain some stability.
   "Money placed on the stock market has become extremely
small," said Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock trading
at Okasan Securities. And any major move in the Middle East
can widely swing prices, he said.
   But a decreased amount of selling and the recovery of
futures indexes back above cash indexes Monday encouraged him
as well as other traders to think that the market has come to
a lull for now.
   Investors held off from buying because of anxiety about
Saturday's warning fire by the U.S. Navy on Iraqi oil tankers
in the Persian Gulf and because of concern about an economic
slowdown in the U.S., as many economists predict a larger
impact of higher oil prices on the U.S. economy than on the
Japanese economy.
   "But sell orders declined sharply Monday, especially from
foreigners," said Shigeru Akiba, head of equity at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew International.
   "It says that investors have already sold what they think
they should {in response to the Persian Gulf unrest}. Stock
prices appear to have stopped falling," the official said.
   What lifted the market's mood was the upward swing of
futures indexes to climb above cash indexes, traders said.
   Reflecting growing expectation for future declines and
active short hedging by institutions, futures indexes had
fallen below cash indexes during most of the past trading
days and early Monday morning.
   But as futures indexes recovered a regular spread Monday,
partly supported by stability on the bond market, fear for a
further sharp fall of stock prices was reduced, traders said.
   Among gainers Monday was Pioneer, which ended at 5500 yen,
up 60 yen ($37.30, up 41 cents), following Friday's report by
the company that said consolidated net income this year will
rise 36% to about 40 million yen.
   Non-ferrous metal shares were bought on rising gold prices
and growing demand for aluminum by beverage can makers and
car makers. Nippon Light Metal gained 20 yen to 1210 yen.
Sumitomo Metal Mining advanced 20 yen to 1580 yen.
   In London, dealers said investors were unwilling to take
new positions or hold existing ones, reflecting the
uncertainty and mounting tensions in the Persian Gulf.
   But, while some dealers said the overall decline was
merely a markdown by market makers trying to entice buying
interest, others said investors were growing more jittery
about holding open positions.
   And there was little comfort from other European stock
markets, badly hit on Middle East worries that spilled over
into the London market, commentators said.
   In addition, a handful of major bluechip issues began
trading ex-dividend, pressuring the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 Share Index. The index fell 20.3 points to
2156.6, ranging during the day from 2176.5 to 2149.2.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index was down 19.4 points at
1659.5. Turnover amounted to a relatively moderate 350.6
million shares, compared with the 500.5 million shares
Friday.
   International issues were pressured from the outset on a
sharply weaker dollar, continuing the recent weak trend.
Unilever shed 14 pence to 643 pence (27 cents to $12.37)
while Courtaulds dropped 13 pence to 299 pence. Moreover, a
handful of stocks with exposure to the U.S. leisure market
were hurt on perceptions of pending recession across the
Atlantic. Rank Organisation slipped 18 pence to 648 pence,
while Grand Metropolitan retreated 13 pence to 574 pence.
   Guinness continued to lose ground after last week's
earnings results from French luxury group LVMH proved
disappointing. Guinness and LVMH have symmetrical
cross-shareholdings in each other. Guinness fell 12 pence to
678 pence.
   Polly Peck slid 17 pence to 307 pence, up from the
intraday low of 294. The retreat came after the company's
chairman late Friday said he would abandon plans to take the
company private through a buy-out of the 74% of shares he
doesn't already own. The London Stock Exchange said soon
afterward that it will launch an investigation over details
regarding the change in plans.
   Among ex-dividend issues, Barclays shed 14 pence to 349
pence, British Petroleum gained 2.5 pence to 368.5 pence,
Commercial Union Assurance fell 8 pence to 468 pence, GKN
dropped 8.5 pence to 332 pence, Standard Chartered dropped 15
pence to 382 pence, and SmithKline Beecham skidded 6 pence to
528 pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed lower in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Madrid and Milan.
South African gold stocks closed lower.
   Also, stocks ended lower in Sydney, Singapore, Hong Kong,
Seoul, Manila and Wellington, and higher in Taipei.

   Stocks Trade in Narrow Range
   As Mideast Stalemate Continues

   NEW YORK -- A stalemate in the desert means a narrow
trading range for stocks on Wall Street.
   That's how analysts and traders alike described
yesterday's trading activity and summed up expectations for
the foreseeable future.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While stock market averages strained to register moderate
gains, most stocks ended lower or unchanged.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 11.64 points to
2656.44, largely due to gains in oil stocks. Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.68 to 328.51, the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.23 to 180.42, and the
Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 0.26 to 304.00.
   But the averages belied the underlying weakness evident in
the market's breadth. Only 629 issues advanced while 920
issues declined and 457 issues ended unchanged. Volume on the
Big Board slumped to 129,630,000 issues, from 212,560,000
shares on Friday.
   "{The activity} could hardly be viewed as a rally," said
Carmine Grigoli, chief equity portfolio strategist at First
Boston.
   Dale Tills, manager of institutional equities trading at
Charles Schwab, said investors are likely to take any
strength as an opportunity to sell, which should keep the
market trading in a range between 2620 and 2660, he said.
   But Mr. Grigoli was less optimistic, saying he expects the
market will continue to move lower in the months ahead as the
impact of oil prices is felt further.
   "I'm looking for the Dow {industrials} to move closer to
the 2500 level in the next few months," Mr. Grigoli says.
   In the meantime, the price of oil will likely determine
the daily swing in prices.
   "Oil to bonds to stocks," is how Kidder Peabody's Stefan
Abrams describes the link between oil and share prices.
   Oil issues rose along with crude-oil futures. Chevron rose
1 3/8 to 80; Exxon added 5/8 to 52 3/4; Texaco rose 1 3/4 to
65 5/8; USX, which owns Marathon Oil, rose 5/8 to 33 1/8; and
Du Pont, which owns Conoco, added 1/4 to 37 5/8.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Grigoli says, every day that the Federal
Reserve doesn't act to ease credit, the market falls further
toward a recession.
   "It would take a significant easing at this point, perhaps
as much as 100 basis points on the federal funds rate," the
rate at which banks loan money to each other overnight, to
revive the economy, he says. A basis point is 1/100th of a
percentage point.
   Mr. Grigoli has advised maintaining cash levels of 25%
since earlier this year, and he doesn't expect to commit any
of that cash to the market soon.
   "The earliest that a significant, sustained rally could
develop in the market would be November or December," he
says.
   He advises emphasizing multinational consumer growth
stocks in order to weather a recession. The earnings of
companies like Procter &amp; Gamble, Philip Morris, and PepsiCo
should remain stable even if the economy doesn't, he says, in
part because of their exposure in European and Far Eastern
markets, where economic activity may remain stronger than in
the U.S.
   But even if the Federal Reserve can steer the economy
through the obstacles presented by higher oil prices and
falling corporate profits, most analysts agree that a
standoff in the Middle East will keep a cap on stock prices.
   Among other oil stocks, Pogo Producing rose 7/8 to 8 1/2,
while Permian Basin Royalty Trust added 3/8 to 5 7/8.
   Harken Energy fell 5/8 to 2 3/8 after reporting a second
quarter loss of 73 cents a share, compared to profit of 7
cents a share in the year-ago quarter after a tax credit.
   Atlantic Richfield gained 1 5/8 to 139 1/8. The oil
company said it will maintain its freeze on gas prices, but
raise prices for diesel and jet fuel.
   British Petroleum slid 1 1/8 to 84 7/8. The company said
it will auction off its gas exploration and production
holding company in the Netherlands. Analysts estimate that
the unit could fetch between $60 million and $70 million.
   Gitano Group was the most striking decliner, plunging 4
7/8 to 19 3/8 on more than 10 times normal volume after
Goldman Sachs analyst Jay Meltzer reduced his earnings
estimates for the company, citing increasing competition in
the retail apparel industry. Mr. Meltzer reduced his 1990
outlook to $2.50 a share from $2.90, and his 1991 estimate to
$3 from $3.40.
   UAL edged up 3 to 104 1/2 while other airline stocks were
lower on rising fuel prices. The leader of the union group
trying to finance a $201-a-share buyout of UAL is scheduled
to meet this week with top Japanese bank officials, according
to the American Banker.
   AMR also rose, adding 1/8 to 47 5/8. The company's AMR
Eagle regional airline division is nearing completion of
negotiations for the purchase of as many as 100 aircraft
valued at about $800 million.
   Capital Cities/ABC added 4 to 508. The company is expected
to benefit from sharply higher ratings for its ABC evening
newscasts since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Texas Utilities added 1/8 to 35 7/8, leading the most
active list in dividend related trading.
   Federal National Mortgage Association fell 1 1/8 to 29
3/4. On Friday, the company released data that shows a key
measure of its profitability was unchanged in July. The
profit measure, the yield spread between Fannie Mae's
mortgage assets above its debt costs, was unchanged at 94
basis points in July.
   WorldCorp added 7/8, or nearly 18%, to 5 3/4. Attention
may have been brought to the stock by a newspaper article
over the weekend that says the company may benefit from the
military's airlift of soldiers and materiel to the Persian
Gulf. WorldCorp provides cargo and passenger charters to the
military and commercial customers.
   H.H. Robertson fell 7/8 to 9 3/4 following the death of a
major dissident shareholder. Anthone Pedone, who died on
Friday, held about half of the 15.9% stake controlled by the
dissident shareholder group known as H.H.R. Acquisition Corp.
The dissident group says, however, that it hasn't changed its
plans to wage a proxy contest to oppose management on certain
issues related to Robertson's merger with Ceco Industries
Inc.
   Weyerhaeuser added 3/4 to 21 1/2 after announcing that it
will resume the repurchase of its stock.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index lost 2.32
to 331.29. Volume totaled 11,770,000 shares.

   As Many Pros Despair, Small Investors
   See Market Rebounding Within a Year

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Investment professionals may be getting
jittery about the outlook for stocks, but some individual
investors remain resolute.
   Many of those who attended one of the country's largest
annual meetings of individual investors believe that the
market, after some turbulence, will be higher a year from
now.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "For more than 50 years, I have bought blue-chip stocks
that pay a 5% dividend, and I have done very well,"
80-year-old Thomas Cordory of San Francisco said. "I don't
intend to change my strategy now." His wife, Helen, also 80,
said, "I love IBM -- and I am holding on forever."
   The Cordorys were among some 500 individual investors who
paid an average of about $2,500 (including travel, hotel and
registration fees) to attend a four-day conference here last
week, sponsored by Investors Seminars Inc.
   The advice they got from financial newsletter writers,
money managers and stock analysts was often blunt. Craig
Corcoran, editor of Davis/Zweig Futures Hotline, an Orange
Park, Fla., newsletter, told them to "sell all stocks and
move into cash and Treasury bills."
   Bert Dohmen, president of Wellington Financial Corp., a
Honolulu money-management firm, said to "sell all stocks and
move your money into foreign currencies." And Joe Granville,
editor of Granville Market Letter, Kansas City, Mo., said to
"sell stocks and buy gold."
   But, despite the escalating confrontation in the Middle
East, rising oil prices and growing recession worries, a poll
taken on the final day of the conference found that more than
half of those attending remain confident. Like the Cordorys,
most of them are older than 50, manage their own money, and
have built up considerable portfolios of blue-chip stocks
that they aren't rushing to sell.
   "There will be a short-term blood bath in the market,"
said a 72-year-old investor, who didn't want his name used.
The man, who identified himself as a retired banker, said he
plans to hold onto his blue-chip stocks -- and smaller
high-tech stocks, too. After a brief crunch, he predicted,
the market "will rebuild a base, consolidate in 1991 and
start up again."
   Some individuals said they even plan to buy stocks --
contrary to the pros' advice. David Koontz, a Laguna Beach,
Calif., investor who is in his 50s, said he purchased several
growth stocks late last week at what he believes were bargain
prices. Among his picks: General Electric Co., Johnson &amp;
Johnson and Home Depot Inc. These stocks, he said, were
"battered down way beyond reason."
   The persistent optimism did nothing to cheer the more
gloomy professionals. "I think individuals don't understand
how bad things really are," Mr. Dohmen, the Honolulu money
manager, said. "When they do, the market will go down
further."
   Mr. Granville, referring to the old saying that the show
"isn't over until the fat lady sings," quipped that counting
the actress and comedienne Roseanne Barr's rendition of the
Star Spangled Banner at a recent baseball game, "even that
has happened."
   But a few bullish pros at the conference believe the
individual investors are correct. Norman Fosback of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., editor and publisher of six investment
newsletters, said he believes the specialists are the victims
of a herd psychology. "The group that usually is wrong is the
experts," he said. "Find out if they are all recommending the
same thing, and then do the opposite." Mr. Fosback himself
sees a short-term correction in a long-term bull market.
   Charles R. Schwab, chairman of Charles Schwab Corp., the
nation's largest discount brokerage firm, said he expects
individual investors to outpace the professionals "in this
market. The pros are getting too fancy." Though his firm
doesn't give advice, Mr. Schwab said he plans to buy some
beaten-down blue-chip stocks for his own account.
   That should be just fine, in the opinion of people such as
Jerry Daley, a thirtysomething "value" investor from
Ridgewood, N.J. He said, "I don't plan to sell in a panic."
And Walter Krysher, 86, of Hudson, Pa., said he remains
optimistic about the economy. He expects the stock market to
continue its upward climb after "this blip."

   From the Pulpits a Mighty Roar:

   Try finding a church manual that tells how to blend the
squeal of racing car tires with the soprano section of a
choir, or how to handle a blast of exhaust at Holy Communion.
   Those are real questions for 10 Denver churches that find
themselves along the circuit of that city's downtown Grand
Prix this Friday through Sunday. And some of the pastors
aren't pleased that they have to come up with answers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's not that the churches don't want to be a participant
with the city" in the auto race, says the Rev. Robert West,
pastor of St. Paul's Lutheran Church. "It's just that we
don't want our right to worship disregarded."
   Mr. West, along with the Rev. John Wilcox, pastor of
nearby Central Presbyterian Church, complained to city
officials months ago that street closings along the 1.9-mile
racecourse would keep many parishioners home. And those who
got through would hear more thunder from the streets than the
pulpit. Still, the city approved the race.
   As a result, Mr. Wilcox's flock plans to pull up stakes
this Sunday and worship with another congregation -- one
whose church is well away from the racecourse. "My philosophy
of life is when you're licked, you don't waste time and stew
in it," he says.
   Mr. West, on the other hand, is staying put. "We may end
up with just an organ recital," he concedes. The Grand Prix's
organizers have agreed to provide an off-duty police officer
to keep race fans from parking in the church's lot.
   Race officials have been working hard to ease the concerns
of the clerics (as well as those of local retailers and
neighborhood groups). They are distributing more than 100,000
"traffic brochures," detailing street closings and alternate
routes, and issuing parking passes for churchgoers.
   That pleased the Rev. C.B. Woodrich, pastor of Holy Ghost
Roman Catholic Church. Aware that he will have two weddings
this weekend, race officials gave the wedding coordinators
maps so that brides, grooms and guests could make it to the
church on time.
   Father Woodrich sees the race actually offering a way to
fill pews, through a little advertising he'll do among the
thousands of race fans Denver is expecting. "I'm going to
make sure they know in the hotels where I am," he says. "I'm
looking for good Mass attendance."

   PARIS -- Pechiney S.A. said unfavorable exchange rate
conditions and weak metals prices contributed to a 10.3% drop

   The aluminum and packaging company said group revenue fell

   I am a fan of New Kids on the Block, and I think that your
July 23 page-one article about them was unfair. You did not
mention the older fans, like me and my girlfriends. I'm 13,
and I still have to have my mommy take me to a concert.
   Maybe you only have to be six or seven years old to know
this, but aren't articles supposed to be written unbiased? I
don't know about you, but I don't think calling their
bubblegum music (according to you) "horrid fluff" and saying,
"At least some older children reject the New Kids as kid's
stuff" sounds like it's written from a neutral point of view.

   You stated that New Kids concerts "look more like day camp
than a rock concert." I am 15 years old and a big fan of the
New Kids. I am disturbed that New Kids fans are stereotyped
as little children that have to bring their parents to the
concerts. The New Kids are so down to earth, easy to relate
to and great performers that "kids" any age should be
represented as New Kids fans, including me.

   As a mother of two pre-teen fans of the New Kids on the
Block, I have no sympathy for Mrs. Flores, who is unable to
afford a "decent dress" for herself after spending a small
fortune on New Kid paraphernalia for her daughter. Poor
little Ivory, hasn't she ever heard the word "no"?
   Susan L. Santos
   Duncannon, Pa.

   I feel the article is totally discriminating against New
Kids on the Block. Though you did quote some music critics,
you only quoted the ones who feel negatively toward them.
Never did you mention that the New Kids were labeled the "Top
Pop Group of 1989" by Billboard or that their second album
went platinum seven times. Instead, you wrote that some feel
they are the "beltless slacks of the entertainment field" and
"a hormonal response rather than music per se."
   Donnie, Danny, Jordan, Jon and Joe encourage kids to work
hard for what they believe in and always be themselves. They
attend "Say No to Drugs" benefits and give a portion of the
proceeds from their telephone hotline to the United Cerebral
Palsy Foundation. Never did you mention any of this.

   You made it sound as if they didn't have any fans over the
age of 10, which just isn't true. I am 17 years old, and my
friends and I enjoy listening to them very much. We attended
their concert, on July 1, at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre,
and saw people of many ages.
   I will agree with you that the majority of their fans are
pre-teens, which I think is good because they are influencing
these kids at a early age to stand up for themselves and say
"No" to drugs. Since drugs are reaching kids at a younger
age, this is a very important lesson to learn.

   RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif. -- Data-Design Laboratories Inc.,
whose net loss widened in the latest quarter, said it might
have to redeem some debentures at a premium unless its
tangible net-worth position improves.
   In the fourth quarter ended June 30, Data-Design's net
loss nearly doubled, to $2.5 million, or 37 cents a share,
from $1.7 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales
rose 2.5%, to $23.5 million, compared with $22.9 million in
1989's fourth quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Data-Design said it is likely that its tangible net worth
on Sept. 30 will be below $28 million, the level specified in
its agreement with holders of its 8.5% debentures. If the
same thing happens again Dec. 31, the company said, it will
have to redeem 10% of the debentures then outstanding at a
possible premium.
   Alan Steel, Data-Design's chief financial officer, said
the company is hopeful about meeting the $28 million target
by year end. Still, "we're talking to our major bondholders
about loosening the requirement to give us a little more
leeway," he said.
   For the full year, the company's net loss narrowed, to
$2.9 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with $12.2
million, or $1.82 a share, last year. Sales increased 1.6%,
to $91.2 million from $89.8 million.
   Data-Design makes printed circuit boards for the computer,
communications and instrumentation industries.

   As an undergraduate at Princeton in the early '70s, I was
a charter member of just such a fan club. The Royal Huntation
Society of Princeton University (its full name) comprised a
small group of hard-core devotees. The members were devoted
enough, in fact, to secure official recognition from the

   Over-the-counter stocks showed no strength, sliding lower
all day as their listed counterparts crept higher.
   Traders reported frustration with the OTC market's
weakness and their inability to explain its retrograde
motion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index closed with a 4.90, or 1.25%,
decline to 388.59. The New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index added 0.23, or 0.13%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
climbed 11.64, or 0.44%.
   "There's nothing nice to say about the OTC," says Steve
Bliss, head of OTC trading for Mabon Nugent &amp; Co.
   Unlisted shares opened with a brief surge only to retreat
for the rest of the day. It was the opposite story on the Big
Board where major averages opened lower, rallied and finished
higher on the day.
   "The OTC just acted horrible right across the board," says
Robert Antolini, head of OTC trading at Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp.
   Traders say buyers were scarce and selective. Volume fell
to 115.5 million shares from 146.9 million shares Friday.
Declining issues led advancers 1,231 to 693.
   The OTC's unwillingness to follow the Big Board higher
mystified traders.
   Mabon Nugent's Mr. Bliss suggests investors were reluctant
to place their money in the less liquid OTC market. He says
those willing to buy despite the Middle East uncertainty
probably felt safer in a more liquid market.
   The day's most active issue was Intel, which lost 1 to 33
1/4 on 2.3 million shares.
   Some of the OTC's biggest issues were battered in the
all-day slide. Microsoft fell 4 3/4 to 55 1/2. Sun
Microsystems dropped 1 1/4 to 26. Nike was 2 1/4 lower to 73
1/4. Reuters's American depositary receipts declined 2 5/8 to
46 3/4.
   But some others managed to defy momentum and finish the
day higher. Apple Computer added 1/4 to 36 3/4. MCI
Communications rose 1/2 to 34 3/4.
   Florida Employers Insurance shares were 4 3/8, or 58%
higher, to 11 7/8 after the company said it signed a letter
of intent to sell either its stock or its assets to American
Employers Group Inc. for about $16 a share.
   Spiegel's Class A shares were down 4, or 16%, to 16. The
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said Spiegel told
analysts last week that sales were slow and customers gave
its fall catalogue a cool reception. Spiegel Chief Financial
Officer Alton M. Withers projected third quarter earnings
would be flat at 21 cents a share.
   Mack Trucks lost 1/4 to 6 1/2. The truck maker said late
Friday that a revised forecast for the year projects losses
of about $180 million compared to a loss of about $185
million for 1989. The company previously projected its 1990
loss at $130 million.
   Millfeld Trading gained 7/8 to 13 1/2 after reported net
income for its second quarter doubled compared with the
period a year ago. The company also extended a warrant offer.
   Radiation Systems also benefited from a positive earnings
report. Fourth quarter net income jumped to 39 cents a share
from 11 cents a year ago. Radiation Systems shares rose 3/8
to 10 3/8.

   Cards Leave an Imprint and Consumers Are Indebted

   The 1980s were a bull market in consumer plastic --
credit, charge, debit and automated-teller cards -- that
changed the way Americans bank and spend. They brought
convenience that is one of the rather invisible gains in
quality of life enjoyed by most of us in a period that is too
casually written off as a gilded era.
   Some equate plastic with phony, contending in this case
that expenditures-made-easy represent a false prosperity for
which we must soon pay dearly. Doubtless, some recklessness
in consumer finance was part of the debt pollution that now
is being cleaned up. But those voices on the political
periphery calling for restrictions on credit cards as part of
a return to solvency have it wrong. The fact that banks, now
the predominant card issuers, are generally pushing these
loans while they tighten up in other sectors is evidence
these purchase plates grease the economy but do not bloat it.

   You get a distinctive view of the card industry at the
Santa Monica, Calif., offices of H. Spencer Nilson, who puts
out a monthly newsletter devoted to the business that has
occupied half of his 69 years, including executive stints at
Diners Club and Carte Blanche.
   Mr. Nilson is upbeat on credit cards, by which he means
any plastic that lets you delay payment -- if only until the
end of the billing cycle. Using figures he boasts of being
singularly able to elicit from card issuers, he says this
debt tripled in nominal terms during the 1980s while the
economy only doubled. Bank cards were the big gainers, up
sixfold. The 1986 tax revision that began a phase-out of
consumer-interest deductions, widely thought to have put a
dent in this trade, registers hardly a blip on his chart. He
shows this growth slackening to a mere doubling during the
'90s, but he attributes that to a lower GNP trajectory not an
aversion to charging.
   If economists don't buy his line, Mr. Nilson scoffs,
that's because they don't have the industry sources that he
does and must rely on incomplete Federal Reserve data. He
admits that not every company confides in him and he must
make an educated guess about some entries. Skeptics among
what Mr. Nilson says are 10,000 readers suspect that he makes
a lot of guesses.
   The card craze that over this century spread from oil
companies to department stores to financial houses has
reached the point where a fanatic such as Mr. Nilson can
accumulate 172 of them. Americans hold a billion, and the
shopper who has any cards at all will have an average of nine
with a total unpaid balance of more than $2,000. Remaining
barriers to use are breaking down, with medical services,
movie tickets and charitable contributions the latest
inroads.
   These paper-work-free loans are hardly high finance, or
even a good way around the crunch that some builders and
other small businesses are complaining about. Although
cardholder Nilson once estimated he could amass a
half-million dollars in cash advances within a month,
job-creating enterprises wouldn't last long paying an annual
rate of about 20%.
   Neither is plastic an end to cash. Indeed, electronic
tellers have made it easier to carry safe amounts, and
greenbacks will always be demanded for small purchases or
those that must be kept secret to avoid taxes, prosecution or
embarrassment. Personal checks, the convenience boon of the
1950s, stand to be the loser, but people still like the float
-- even though technology has shortened it -- that these give
between purchase and payment. That's one reason that Mr.
Nilson isn't big on debit cards, which usually draw down a
bank balance instantly. Giving a merchant the ability to tap
directly into his funds bothers him. He also thinks consumers
will resist shifting from credit to debit cards and losing
the option of contesting a billing before it has been paid.
   As with other competitive industries, buyer preference
along with market structure and technology will shape the
card trade. In addition to paying higher fees for status
cards such as those from American Express, some consumers
have clung to using retailer cards even though bank-card
acceptance has made alternatives unnecessary in most
instances.
   Merchandisers maintain their own label cards (while
increasingly farming out the billing) largely because the
holders make up a great marketing list. James F. Smith, a
veteran of the Sears charge operation (he oversaw the rollout
of the company's Discover card in 1985) who now teaches
finance at the University of North Carolina, recalls that the
chain once offered a Winnie-the-Pooh doll to pregnant
cardholders and got a 25% response.
   Big U.S. banks, hurting in so many ways, are aggressively
seeking new card accounts because they remain profitable. But
Mr. Nilson thinks the big players in Visa and MasterCard this
decade will be the European banks. The JCB card from Japan,
meanwhile, is still a minuscule presence in the U.S.; First
Interstate Bancorp. economist Jerry Jordan says this is
partly because Japanese banks don't care to hold dollar
assets at present.
   The big story in credit, however, is the AT&amp;T card
introduced this year. At no annual fee, Mr. Nilson believes
it is the wave of the future. "AT&amp;T amazed me in how
professional and smart they were in so many ways," he says,
placing it No. 6 in the market already. At this pace it will
be No. 2 behind Citibank (which now has 29 million holders)
within a year. Meanwhile, the card issuers are expanding
their service scope to provide insurance, discounts on phone
bills and legal services.
   The downside for consumers, Mr. Nilson forecasts, is a
steady rise in interest rates on cards, maybe to 25% (largely
because of losses from skyrocketing personal bankruptcies,
which he and other specialists blame on lax new laws and not
overborrowing). And, he says, higher rates charged to
merchants by banks will, with cards now so pervasive, bring
on a general rise in retail prices. Others in the field
challenge that notion.
   Without a general price effect, it's hard to argue that
even the 75 million American adults without credit cards are
losers in the positive-sum world of plastic. (Many of them
are missing the fun by their own doing; Mr. Nilson says
Citibank alone purges 2.5 million a year from its rolls.)
With tax revision having eliminated the deductibility of
consumer finance for those who itemize, the only hidden
subsidies remaining are those folded into the outrageous
write-off for "home-equity" loans.
   State usury laws impeded this revolution until the
interest-rate blowout a decade ago finished most of them off.
Now the appeal of freedom of choice, and the ability of
lenders to work their way around restrictions by locating
processing centers (and jobs) in friendly states, has
rendered the legislative threat virtually moot. And for the
nearly half of card users who pay their bills off before any
penalty applies, the future of low-fee, no-hassles credit --
brought to us by competitive banking and retailing -- looms
bright indeed.

   Denison Mines Had
   Second-Period Loss
   Of $84.9 Million

   TORONTO -- Denison Mines Ltd. reported a second-quarter
net loss of 97.1 million Canadian dollars (US$84.9 million),
after writing down half its oil and gas assets and providing
for the cost of reducing the work force at its Canadian
uranium operations.
   Denison, a Toronto-based resources concern, said it also
omitted paying dividends on its preferred shares. The company
said it made the move because of declining profit from
operations brought on by lower oil and gas production and
prices as well as weak potash prices. The company hasn't paid
cash dividends on its common shares since 1986.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest quarterly loss compared with net profit in the
year-earlier period of C$8 million, or one Canadian cent a
share. Revenue fell to C$84.2 million from C$98.5 million.
   On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Denison's Class A shares
plunged 35 Canadian cents, or 18%, to close yesterday at
C$1.65. The Class B shares fell 22 Canadian cents to C$1.35.
   Denison's preferred stock also plummetted. The Series A
preferred shares closed at C$7.50, down C$4.75. The Series B
shares halved in value, losing C$7.88 to close at C$7.88.
   Denison spokesman Ed Shiller said the company wrote down
C$80 million on its Italian oil interests because of lower
crude prices and a reduction in proven reserves. He said the
write-down doesn't reflect the economic value of the
property, however, because of rising oil prices since the end
of the second quarter.
   Mr. Shiller said the write-down shouldn't affect the
company's ability to sell its overseas oil and gas interests,
which have been up for sale for more than a year. Disposing
of these interests, which are located in Italy, Greece, Spain
and Egypt, is critical to Denison's ability to reduce its
burdensome debt load, analysts say. The company had debt of
C$316 million as of Dec. 31, 1989.
   Denison also has been hurt by costly uranium operations
and market prices that are at record lows. The company
previously announced plans to reduce the work force at its
Elliot Lake, Ontario, uranium mine by about 30% as of Aug. 1.
Denison said it took a provision of C$4.2 million in the
second quarter to cover costs of scaling back operations at
the mine.

   Real Estate:
   Housing Slump Boosts Relocation Costs

   The housing slump presents relocation managers with a new
challenge: how to unload scores of Victorians, colonials and
Tudors.
   Depressed real-estate prices have saddled corporations
with a hefty backlog of homes purchased because transferred
employees can't find their own buyers. As a result,
relocation costs are spiraling and some companies are
rethinking transfer policies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co., Los Angeles, has an inventory of
once-coveted California houses. "People used to stand in line
to bid on them," says Catherine Morris, a senior analyst of
compensation and policy at Arco. Now, she says, it takes two
to three months to sell a house after Arco buys it -- and
that's usually after the employee has tried for months to
find a buyer. When the house finally does sell, Arco
typically takes an 8% loss.
   Companies usually offer to buy homes if transferred
employees can't find buyers on their own. But in today's
slow-moving real estate market, for-sale signs are out for
much longer and companies are burdened with steep carrying
costs.
   Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, says selling a
house takes an average of 180 days, up from 150 days last
year. "The biggest piece of our costs is that carrying time,"
says Regina Belli, manager of relocation services. "And the
longer it sits on the market, the more likely it is to have a
stigma attached. People think there must be something wrong
with this house."
   Housing prices in once-hot markets such as New England and
Southern California have dropped substantially in recent
months. Houses in Manchester, N.H., and Boston are selling
for 6% below last year's prices, according to Runzheimer
International, a consulting firm.
   "Now I'm satisfied if we sell an East Coast house within a
year," says Lynn Pellicciarini, an assistant vice president
in charge of relocation at BankAmerica Corp. in San
Francisco. Prices in other markets, such as Arizona and
Colorado, are also expected to fall as the government
auctions real estate from failed thrifts.
   Companies trying to unload houses in this market often
take a double hit. When buying a house from a transferred
employee, they generally cover the difference, if any,
between what the employee originally paid and the current
appraisal; then, to land a buyer, companies are forced to
sell at a discount.
   The Employee Relocation Council, a Washington, D.C., trade
group, estimates that about half of its 1,000 corporate
members this year will be forced to use a loss-on-sale
provision for moves, up from just 13% three years ago.
   Westinghouse pays up to $5,000 to help defray an
employee's loss on a house sale. Ms. Belli estimates the
company is using the loss program 5% more often than last
year.
   In the past, Mitre Corp., a Bedford, Mass., systems
engineering consulting firm with 6,000 employees, rarely had
to buy houses in a move because "employees could always get a
better offer" on their own, says Steve Nurney, relocation
administrator. "Now they're better off taking ours."
   The company is using the loss-on-sale provision twice as
often as last year, he says, adding that the weakest markets
are Boston, Houston and Colorado Springs, Colo. Sometimes the
loss provision is merely a few thousand dollars, "but it can
easily be half of the total cost of a move," Mr. Nurney says.
Ms. Pellicciarini of BankAmerica adds: "I've seen them in
excess of $30,000" on East Coast or Arizona homes that were
purchased in the past three years and resold this year.
   The result: Relocation costs have risen sharply.
Runzheimer estimates that the average cost to relocate an
employee who owns a home was $40,939 at the end of 1989, up
from $36,891 in 1988. Though a 1990 estimate isn't available,
companies say their costs have jumped. For instance,
Westinghouse says its average has increased to $55,000 per
employee from $50,000 last year.
   Costs are also rising because more transferred employees
demand temporary lodging for their families in between
houses. In some cases, BankAmerica now expects to pay 90
days' lodging instead of one month. In the San Francisco
area, where an apartment may rent for $2,000 a month, that
increased stay is quite costly, Ms. Pellicciarini says.
   Rising costs are prompting companies to rethink whom they
move and what they are willing to pay. "It's receiving a lot
of concern from top management," says Mitre's Mr. Nurney.
"For the first time, real estate has become a consideration
in selecting a candidate to fill a job." In two recent cases,
Mitre management decided not to move employees because it was
"too big of a loss to swallow," he says.
   Other companies say they're reining in some relocation
spending, agreeing to cover only actual losses on a house,
not other investment property, such as vacant land around a
house. "When times are good, the issue doesn't come up," says
Gini Santos, world-wide policy development manager for
Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, Calif. But now, she adds,
Hewlett-Packard won't reimburse employees for losses on land.
   Some companies say they are getting complaints from
employees who feel pinched by the efforts to rein in costs.
Kevin Reid, a Digital Equipment Corp. relocation manager,
says the company has received "a fair number" of complaints
from employees about its purchase offers. "When the market is
like this, people are going to lose money," he says. "It's
not a happy time when you find out something you bought two
or three years ago is now worth $20,000, $30,000 or $40,000
less." But he says the company's offers are in line with
selling prices these days. Mr. Reid adds that Digital is
holding about 30% more houses than last year and takes an
average loss of 8% on each house it sells.
   Other employees at the computer giant have chosen to stay
put in jobs rather than seek a transfer that would force them
to put their homes up for sale, Mr. Reid says. That stay-put
attitude is cropping up at some other companies, too. The
housing slump "is making it extremely difficult to get people
to transfer from one market to another," says Harvey J.
Auger, president of PHH Homequity, a Wilton, Conn.,
relocation firm.
   To move houses faster, more companies are striking special
deals. Some employees are offered payments equal to 1% to 2%
of their house's value if they sell it themselves.
   Westinghouse figures it costs at least $10,000 less if
employees sell their own homes, so they offer more pre-sale
marketing tips to workers, Ms. Belli says. If the company
does buy the house, it offers higher broker commissions and
incentives to get the house shown more frequently.
   Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del., helps arrange mortgages for
buyers in areas such as Hobbs, N.M., where its Conoco
subsidiary recently closed a facility and pulled out 40
workers. "We want to help cushion the blow to a community's
real-estate market," says Steve Rogers, a relocation
supervisor at Du Pont.
   Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, Providence, R.I., recently
began a mortgage "buy-down" program that offers buyers a 3%
break on the mortgage during the first year, 2% in the second
year and 1% in the third. "It can be significant savings for
a buyer," says David Farley, corporate employment director.
   More importantly for the company, it helps move houses.
"If you're looking at two comparable houses," he says,
"you'll lean more toward our house."

   Airports Try to Ease the Pain of Waiting
   With New Ways for Fliers to Spend Money

   Airports, in a takeoff on the friendly skies, are trying
to profit by becoming more friendly on the ground.
   The main things that drive passengers batty -- lousy
airline service, surly ticket agents and bad weather -- are
beyond an airport's control. But airport officials are
realizing, more and more, that they can ease a traveler's
pain, or make it worse. "When you're delayed, are you forced
to spend $5 on a hot dog? Or do you have a pleasant
experience?" asks Robert Bunnell, a vice president at Airport
Operators Council International in Washington.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's not always obvious, but airports are beginning to
offer consumers ways to spend their time there pleasantly or
productively. Several have opened business centers where
executives can fax on the fly. In Pittsburgh and Boston,
kiddie travelers can romp on slides and merry-go-rounds. Many
airports are jazzing up their retail shops and clamping down
on notoriously high food prices. Some even tried electronic
golf driving ranges.
   "Airports have fallen behind in providing creature
comforts, and they're going to catch up in the next five
years," says Steven Reiss, the Alexandria, Va.-based
airport-design director for HNTB, a Kansas City, Mo.,
architectural and engineering firm. Nintendo games, rental
movies and exercise clubs will become common at airports, he
predicts.
   Moreover, with airline delays increasing what is known as
passenger "dwell time" in terminals, it is in the financial
self-interest of airports to serve up appealing distractions.
   In the past, many airports have fallen short with cramped
spaces, tacky souvenir stands and unappetizing food. "They
haven't always placed the needs of the traveler first,"
concedes Patrick Moscaritolo, director of Boston's Logan
International Airport. Tom Moriarity, a senior associate with
the Washington office of Halcyon Ltd., a real-estate
consultant with headquarters in Hartford, Conn., says,
"Airports are changing to keep pace with the public, which is
more knowledgeable and has higher expectations" than before.
   The drive to make airports more attractive is spurred by
the increasing recognition among local communities -- which
usually own the airports -- that airports are important
marketing tools in attracting new businesses, expanding
convention trade and increasing domestic and international
air service. The operators believe improved services will
help them compete with other airports for passengers while
also bringing in more money.
   Business travelers are prime targets. Since 1983, for
example, Tele-Trip Co., a unit of Mutual of Omaha Insurance
Cos., based in Omaha, Neb., has opened two dozen business
centers at 20 airports, including Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport, Baltimore-Washington International
Airport, New York's La Guardia Airport and Los Angeles
International Airport. Most of the centers offer secretarial
and notary services, conference-room rentals and
overnight-mail service. Sending faxes -- which costs $6 for
the first page and $2.50 for each additional page -- is the
most popular service.
   Harried parents with traveling tots are getting more
attention, too. At the Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport and Boston's Logan Airport, they can find refuge in
"Kidsport," special areas equipped with toy rocket ships,
child-sized furniture and nursing areas. "Sometimes the room
gets trashed, and toys and books disappear," says Pat Boyle,
a spokesman for the Pittsburgh airport. "But then we'll get a
gushy letter from some parent, who says, `Thank God it was
there.'"
   Stapleton International Airport in Denver is about to open
a similar play area developed in cooperation with the local
Children's Museum. At Las Vegas's McCarran International
Airport, a baby-changing room that can be used by fathers or
mothers is a popular new feature.
   Not all novel ideas work. One merchant operated electronic
driving ranges, called "Take Off and Tee Off," where
travelers could practice their golf swings between flights at
Pittsburgh and Denver. But the ranges closed for lack of
interest. The idea may get another try in the new Denver
airport, set to open in the fall of 1993.
   Meanwhile, other innovations are taking off. Food is a
good example. The anonymous coffee shop serving mystery meat
is giving way to food courts, which feature several small
eateries, and food carts, which offer increased variety with
a modest inventory. Both are popular in malls.
   Price controls are spreading, too. Airports used to award
contracts to the concessionaires that offered to pay the
airport the highest percentage of gross receipts, a practice
that critics say encouraged overcharging the public to drive
up revenue.
   But, tired of hearing consumer complaints about $2 cups of
coffee, many airport officials are structuring "agreements so
that exorbitant prices aren't charged," says Richard Haury,
program manager for the new Denver airport and a senior vice
president at Irving, Texas-based Greiner Engineering Inc.
Many airports, including Portland (Ore.) International,
Boston Logan and Washington National, require prices to be
close to off-airport prices. In return, some charge lower
rents.
   Washington National officials also scrapped the
traditional approach of relying on a single concessionaire to
run all the airport's watering holes. They instead hired a
developer who subcontracts space to competing restaurateurs
-- with spectacular results. At a year-old food court at the
USAir terminal, sales are clipping along at an impressive
$3.30 per departing passenger (a standard way of measuring
airport sales). That compares with an average $1.12 spent at
the airport's restaurants before the food court opened.
   "What it says is, if you give people quality and products
at reasonable prices, people will spend the money," says
Clyde Bingman, manager of commercial programs for the
Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which runs
Washington National and Washington Dulles International
Airport.
   Another food trend is the greater use of brand names.
"Instead of generic pizza, you might get Pizza Hut," says
Halcyon's Mr. Moriarity. The brand names assure travelers
they are getting value for their dollar, adds Mr. Bingman.
Haagen-Dazs Ice Cream, Au Bon Pain and Sbarro are
increasingly finding homes in airports.
   Not to mention singles' bars. Anton's Bar and Grill at
Washington National is a popular nightspot. "What more could
you want?" says HNTB's Mr. Reiss. "You've got security,
anonymity, food, cocktails. . ." and if you don't like
another customer, "all you have to say is, `Sorry, got to
catch a plane.'"
   In airport retailing, some national chains are becoming
interested in what they see as an affluent, untapped market.
Encouraged by the success of their two stores at John F.
Kennedy International Airport, officials at Bloomingdale's
Bloomie's Express plan to open four more stores in airports
this year and seven next year. Nature Co., which is owned by
CML Group Inc. of Acton, Mass., is "interested in pursuing"
an expansion into the airport market, says Jennifer Kaiser,
the company's director of public relations.
   European airports have been far ahead of American ones in
turning their airports into quasi-shopping malls, with
Copenhagen and Amsterdam leading the list. Both have large
offerings of duty-free goods. Frankfurt, Rome and Zurich
airports also have assorted retail and food outlets.
   Some U.S. airports are emphasizing stores featuring items
made locally or of local interest. "People really want
regional merchandise, not necessarily a mug stamped with a
logo with that city," says Sharon Bergman, senior director of
retail for Concession Air, one of the nation's biggest
airport concessionaires and a unit of Buffalo, N.Y.-based
Delaware North Co.
   Thus, passengers can buy sourdough bread at San Francisco
International Airport, cajun food at New Orleans
International Airport and fresh lobsters at Boston Logan.
Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, which will open a
major new terminal in November, will feature merchandise made
in Arizona or elsewhere in the Southwest.
   The Portland airport has married both retail trends: Nike
Inc., whose corporate headquarters is nearby, has a store
there, and so do several small local retailers who are
pushing made-in-Oregon items and hiking supplies.
   Such local items enhance efforts by airport designers to
instill a sense of place in bland airport terminals. At the
McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, aluminum palm
trees are intermingled with 565 slot machines. The new
Phoenix terminal will display $2 million in art with
Southwestern motifs. It's not always easy for a community to
decide what identity to stress at the airport. "Some people
say Denver is a cowboy town," says Greiner's Mr. Haury, "yet
others say Denver is mountains."
   Airports today ignore consumer needs at their own peril,
says Boston's Mr. Moscaritolo: "People can always fax or
teleconference. There are alternatives to getting on a
plane."

   WASHINGTON -- MCI Communications Corp. appointed three new

   Mr. Crane, who had been Southeast division president,

   OPEC may be in its worst crisis yet, but it has support in
Russia.
   The Soviet Union's largest republic would like to join the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia's
foreign economics minister told a news conference in Moscow.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We are prepared to enter as one of the members of OPEC,
now perhaps as an observer but in the future, if we are
accepted, to enter fully," said the minister, Viktor
Yaroshenko.
   The Soviet Union is the world's largest oil producer,
although output has been declining and is now down to under
12 million barrels a day, most of which is used domestically.
Russia accounts for the bulk of the country's oil production.
It is, in effect, the Texas of the Soviet Union in size and
oil output.
   According to Mr. Yaroshenko, the republic considers itself
free to join OPEC because of its assertion of independence of
central Soviet control. Its parliament has decided that it,
and not Soviet authorities, control resources on Russia's
territory.
   The Soviet Union itself has long been interested in OPEC.
It has sent observers to OPEC meetings and has attempted to
cooperate with other oil exporters, both in and out of OPEC,
when production restraints were necessary in the past to prop
up prices.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Rage Greets a Reheated Roy Rogers Ad

   Two years back, the Roy Rogers fast-food chain irked lunch
ladies everywhere with a commercial tweaking school-cafeteria
food and the dough-faced ladies who serve it, to the tune
"See You in September."
   The ads worked better than any Roy Rogers commercials
before -- but the chain, with tail between its legs, pulled
them after complaints by the American School Food Service
Association, the group that represents lunch ladies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last week, though, Roy Rogers and its new owner, Hardee's
Food Systems, defiantly trotted out the commercial again.
"We're sorry if any group is offended by this . . . {but}
it's a fun commercial that's done in good taste. We told {Roy
Rogers} to go ahead and run it," declared John Merritt, a
Hardee's senior vice president, yesterday morning.
   Yet after just five days on the air, it looks like deja vu
at Roy Rogers. By yesterday afternoon, after much conferring
behind closed doors, the chain announced that it was pulling
the ad -- again.
   The reason? The lunch ladies revolted -- again. "We were
livid that the ads came back. We thought they had been sent
to the advertising graveyard," says a spokesman for the
School Food association.
   A humbled Mr. Merritt late yesterday explained that the
company reversed its decision because of "the bigger issue of
the role of food service in the American system." In other
words, enough abuse, already: "We {fast-food purveyors} are
already wrongfully blamed for a lot of the country's ills,
including global warming and the premature aging of the
adolescent population."
   Ironically, for all the fuss the commercial is raising,
Mr. Merritt says it wasn't resurrected as a publicity stunt,
but because it sold sandwiches and was a lot cheaper than
producing a new spot. The ad shows beefy cafeteria marms
shoving plateloads of stomach-churning, unidentifiable fare
toward the camera. "You know what September means," warns the
voiceover.
   By pulling the spot, Roy Rogers joins the ranks of other
American advertisers who have caved in to pressures from
interest groups. Not that those groups have had much of an
impact on sales; last year Clorox and Mennen emerged
unscathed from boycotts launched by the Rev. Donald Wildmon,
who charged that the companies bought air time on
"questionable" TV shows. Still, many advertisers now kowtow
to their attackers, apologize profusely and promise never to
repeat their sins.
   But the situation at Roy Rogers is an especially odd one,
considering the company has lived through it -- almost word
for word -- before.
   The first time around, in 1988, Roy Rogers's then-owner,
Marriott Corp., decided to pull the ads after the
food-service group threatened to boycott its hotels. After
the ads were pulled, the group insisted Marriott didn't move
quickly enough -- and boycotted anyway.
   This time, Roy's new attitude came from Hardee's, which
bought the fast-food chain from Marriott with plans to
convert the Roy Rogers outlets into Hardee's restaurants. As
the Roy Rogers chain shrinks, less attention is paid to its
marketing functions -- and less money is spent on its ads,
making the popular lunch-ladies ad seem like a sure-fire
winner.
   Considering Roy Rogers continues to exist only in a
handful of markets in the East, Hardee's didn't think anyone
would raise much of a fuss over a two-year-old commercial,
Mr. Merritt says.
   At the ad agency that created the spot, Washington-based
Earle Palmer Brown Cos., executives say they are confounded
by the whole turn of events. "Look, these people are totally
overreacting," says Mark Goldstein, the agency's president,
who says he still doesn't know what spot Roy's will run after
"Lunch Ladies" takes its final bow Friday.
   "I have very fond memories of the women who worked in the
cafeteria at my elementary school," he says. "The women in
this commercial remind me of them. When you're eight years
old, those women look bigger than you, they look older than
you . . . and they're strict]"

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Fairfield Communities Inc. said First
National Bank of Boston terminated Fairfield's right to draw
additional loans under its $45 million revolving credit
facility, and is requiring Fairfield to repay the loan
outstanding amount of $23.2 million in 47 equal monthly
installments, beginning next month.
   The loss of financing will result in a "significantly"
reduced level of resort-site sales in the third-quarter, as
well as layoffs of an unspecified number of the company's
3,000 workers, said Fairfield, a developer of recreational
and retirement communities. As for earnings, the company said
it was "not yet able to quantify the scope, possible effects
or financial result" of the credit termination.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fairfield President John W. McConnell said the bank's
decision came as a surprise. "We've had a 20-year banking
relationship with the Bank of Boston, and we've never
defaulted," he said. Asked to explain the bank's move, Mr.
McConnell said, "That would be speculation. But we do know
that the Bank of Boston has written off hundreds of millions
in loans, and we know that Fairfield Communities' performance
has been less than satisfactory."
   In the second quarter, the Bank of Boston charged off $200
million in bad loans, enabling it to reduce its nonperforming
assets to $1.96 billion from $1.98 billion.
   In the year ended Dec. 31, Fairfield Communities posted a
loss of almost $25 million, or $2.27 a share, on revenue of
about $240 million. Almost $23 million of that loss came from
the sale of discontinued operations. In the first half of
1990, the company had net income of $1.7 million, or 16 cents
a share, including an $840,000 benefit from tax-loss
carry-forwards.
   Observers of the company said they shared Mr. McConnell's
puzzlement. Said Kenneth Campbell, president of Audit
Investments and editor of the Realty Stock Review, "It looks
like someone in Boston said, `Where can we get some money
back?' and went down the list of profitable customers."
   Others say Fairfield's mistake was simply being in the
real estate industry. "There's a generalized credit crunch
affecting real estate borrowers," said Sheldon Grodsky,
director of research for Kenneth, Jerome &amp; Co., adding that
the Bank of Boston in particular "has had its head handed to
itself in real estate lending."
   Mr. McConnell said Bank of Boston was "one of several"
major lenders to Fairfield. He said he had not been notified
of any other credit terminations. He said the $23.2 million
owed Bank of Boston represented less than 10% of Fairfield's
debt. He said the company would seek a lender to replace Bank
of Boston.

   Mail Boxes Etc., San Diego, said it recovered from an

made to settle certain litigation.
   The insurance recovery will result in a gain of about
$240,000 in the second quarter ending Oct. 31 because the
entire settlement amount has already been written off, the
company said.
</LP>

   The litigation involved charges by Nancy Tash, daughter of
the company's late founder, Gerald Aul, that the company and
its president, Anthony DeSio, fraudulently induced her to
sell her 23% stake in 1983. Mail Boxes is a franchiser of
postal-business and communication service centers.

   Operation PUSH, the Chicago-based civil-rights group,
declined to end its national boycott of Nike Inc. products
despite the company's announcement Friday of new
affirmative-action goals.
   The Beaverton, Ore., athletic apparel company's new goals
include naming a minority to the Nike board, increasing the
number of non-white department heads by 10% within 12 months
and naming a minority vice president within 24 months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rev. Tyrone Crider, director of PUSH, called Nike's goals
"inadequate." He repeated PUSH's demand that Nike use
minority-owned banks, advertising agencies and other service
companies.
   "The boycott and blackout campaign against Nike has not
ended. In fact, our efforts have intensified," he said.
   Operation PUSH has called for the boycott because it says
that Nike gets about 30% of its $2.4 billion of annual
revenue from black customers, but invests little in the black
community and has no high-level black employees.
   Nike says it gets closer to 15% of its revenue from
blacks. It has defended its policies and has alleged that
PUSH has financial connections with rival athletic wear
company Reebok International Ltd. PUSH has denied the
allegation.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Nike shares closed
at $73.25, down $2.25.

   U.S. Troops, After Long Flight and Bus Ride
   Into Saudi Desert, Wait in the Blinding Heat

   SOMEWHERE IN THE DESERT, Saudi Arabia -- Marine Cpl. Jerry
M., a thin young man with a worried smile, has set up his
mortar unit in what could only be described as a moonscape of
lifeless rock and hot, wind-parched sand.
   His stubby 81mm mortar is ready, pointed north toward the
Kuwaiti border. The five men in his squad sit in the sparse
shade afforded by a thin camouflage net. The chaos of the
past five days -- the 23-hour flight from California, the
massive confusion at a plane-choked airport, the long drive
to the sea to unload Marine equipment -- is finished. Now
comes the hardest part: the waiting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He and thousands of other noncommissioned officers are now
the key players here, in the aftermath of the largest
military buildup over a short span in U.S. history. Now that
the troops are here, they must be kept in fighting trim.
   It is about 110 degrees on the baked, white floor of an
old cement quarry where Cpl. M.'s commander, Lt. Col. James
Mattis, has positioned his company. Col. Mattis talks
excitedly about how interesting it is to be in a place where
the only neighbors are a handful of Bedouins and their
camels: "This is just like Lawrence of Arabia."
   Meanwhile, for the benefit of a visiting television crew,
some of the troops are doing wind sprints, showing how
quickly they can run and set up a machine gun.
   But the harshest aspect of being here is probably what is
most on the minds of the men sitting quietly under Cpl. M.'s
camouflage net. "The sergeant and I are trying to keep their
morale up, joking around and all. As long as they stay in
good humor, we'll be all right," he says. "But the main thing
that's getting everybody out here is the heat."
   (Under the rules of press censorship established by the
Pentagon for this operation, officers can be identified, but
not enlisted men and the names of military bases and troop
positions here.)
   Complaints about sitting around in the heat with no
obvious enemy to confront come first to Cpl. M. "I have to be
a father figure, reminding them when to drink water and
things like that. And I'm only 22 years old," he adds. "It's
a drastic change."
   The complaints eventually filter up to Maj. Gen. John
Hopkins, who notes that his men train regularly in the Mojave
Desert at 29 Palms, Calif. But he admits that he, too, is
awed by the brutal, more humid climate here. "This desert
would make 29 Palms look like Aspen, Colo.," he says.
   Nonetheless, he adds, "I feel confident about it. This is
our stock and trade. This is exactly what the Marine Corps is
all about."
   The introduction to Saudi Arabia comes for most soldiers
on what seems to be a square mile of concrete, floating in
the desert here in the Eastern Province of the kingdom. Like
most Saudi facilities, it was built king-sized. It is one of
the largest air bases in the world.
   There are times, though, when the U.S. Air Force almost
fills it up, simultaneously positioning, unloading and
refueling as many as 15 transports at one time. Tanks, jeeps
and other equipment sprawl over the runway as dazed Marines
and paratroopers stumble into the humid night after their
long journey from home.
   The first troops to arrive last week, a brigade of the
82nd Airborne Division, literally outran their supply line
and had to be supported in the field for two days on Hardee's
beef sandwiches mysteriously produced by the Saudis. There
was a one-day traffic jam on the runway when officials
discovered they didn't have the proper equipment to refuel
the planes.
   It has been an ordeal for the pilots, too. Often flying
24-hour shifts, they shuttle in and out from U.S. bases in
West Germany and Spain. Sgt. Walter K., the Air Force "port
director" who choreographs the movements of the giant,
whining C-141 and C-5B transports on the runway, can let them
stay only for two hours -- just long enough to unload and
refuel.
   "I don't think anything in history has happened with a
surge this big," says the sergeant. The top brass here agree,
saying that even counting World War II, the U.S. has never
airlifted so much so quickly.
   So far, after hundreds of arrivals, only one transport has
broken down on the runway. Maj. T.J. Hedding III, 37, an Air
Force reservist from San Bernardino, Calf., wonders how long
the human side will hold up.
   He flew his C-141 in yesterday and stood watching as a
group of young Marines prepared their equipment. When he
flies back to the U.S. air base at Torrejon, Spain, he will
sleep in a cramped 10-by-10-foot room with three other pilots
on cots. Ten hours later, he will be aloft on another run to
Saudi Arabia. He has been doing that for seven days in a row.
   "These kids are all gung-ho," says Maj. Hedding, referring
to the Marines. "I don't think the fact that they are on the
brink of a real shooting war has sunk in yet."
   If there is a war here, it will be the first one in which
the troops are driven to the front in red, white and blue
double-decker buses. The Saudis have borrowed them from
transit systems in Riyadh and elsewhere and they line up at
the air base day and night, waiting to shuttle the troops out
to the desert.
   After waiting at the air bases for a day-and-a-half,
Marine Sgt. David J., 29, of Lawrence, Ill., and his men
boarded one of the buses and it promptly got lost, the driver
weaving back and forth on the empty Los Angeles-sized
freeways here for five hours before he found the seaport
where the Marines were to draw their heavy equipment.
   "For a while, all we talked about was chemical weapons,"
recalls the sergeant, who says his men have gradually become
acclimated to the heat and resigned to the possibility of
having to face an Iraqi poison-gas attack.
   The seaport is the key to the sudden presence of Gen.
Hopkins's 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade. There, Col. Bob
Redlin, the brigade's logistics officer, says 2,000
containers and 3,000 tanks, howitzers, trucks, armored cars
and other items were unloaded in 36 hours from three ships
that sailed in from the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian
Ocean.
   "Ten days ago, I was in Norfolk, Va., at my
father-in-law's funeral and this stuff was sitting in storage
in Diego Garcia. A week later, I was in this port unloading
the equipment," he says, referring to the growing mountain of
gear and supplies -- enough to sustain 16,500 men for 30 days
of combat -- that is arriving on the docks here.
   The next problem he and other officers face is how to
provide relief for their tired troops if the Persian Gulf
crisis evolves into a long waiting game. Arranging rest and
recreation will be difficult here, in a country that forbids
alcoholic beverages and is extremely concerned about
protecting women from even the gaze of outsiders.
   "As long as it remains Saudi R&amp;R, we have no trouble with
that," notes one Saudi official.

   NEW YORK -- Investors, relieved that once again the Middle
East didn't explode over the weekend, timidly bid prices of
big stocks slightly higher.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.64 points to
2656.44 on volume of 129.6 million shares. Long-term U.S.
Treasury bond prices ended little changed, although they were
up in very light trading most of the day partly because of a
dip in oil prices. The dollar was mostly higher.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The gain in the Dow Jones industrials doesn't signal a
market turnaround, traders said. Broader market measures
didn't perform as well. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and
the New York Stock Exchange composite index both rose
proportionately much less than the Dow, and over-the-counter
stocks fell. Even on the Big Board the number of declining
issues was well ahead of advancers.
   Barry Saghal, research director at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp;
Co., noted that the Dow derived much of its strength from
oil-related issues. Assuming the Mideast situation doesn't
develop suddenly into either all-out war or peace, he expects
stock prices to sag in midweek and then take another nose
dive before the weekend.
   "The markets just don't know how to discount acts of war,"
said Mr. Saghal.
   Paul Kronlokken, technical analyst at Piper, Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood, Minneapolis, said he wasn't surprised to see
blue-chip stocks rise a little. The market's 11.4% decline
since the Dow Jones industrials nearly breached 3000 last
month has been more persistent than the 9.5% selloff in
January that took the Dow to 2543.24, the low for the year,
he noted.
   Bond traders said what little action there was for much of
the day consisted of investors selling short-term notes and
buying long-term bonds in anticipation of an auction of
two-year and five-year notes next week. Traders are betting
such an auction will depress prices on short-term debt. But
trading was extremely thin and prices fell back in late
afternoon.
   The dollar rose against most major currencies but fell
against the yen because of cross-trading among non-U.S.
currencies. Traders were buying yen, having concluded that
Japan is less vulnerable to the lack of oil supplies from
Iraq and Kuwait than previously thought, said Jeffrey
Mondschein, foreign-exchange director at Continental Bank in
Chicago.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose in thin trading. Declining Big Board
issues outnumbered advancers, 920 to 629.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were flat. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond stood at 8.93%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.5650 marks and 146.44 yen, compared
with 1.5495 marks and 147.58 yen Friday.

   An attempt to have Eastern Airlines and its former sister
airline, Continental, declared a single carrier for labor
bargaining fizzled last week, more than two years after it
began.
   The parent of the two airlines, Continental Airlines
Holdings Inc., ultimately won in its attempt to have the move
dropped, but only because it lost control of Eastern four
months ago. In April, a bankruptcy judge ousted Continental
Holdings -- previously known as Texas Air Corp. -- and
appointed a trustee to run Eastern. Continental Holdings
retains control of Continental Airlines.

   The National Mediation Board, the federal agency that
oversees airline labor relations, cited the trustee
appointment as the reason for the ruling last Friday.
   The mediation board said, however, it would let the unions
refile their requests if the bankruptcy court approves a
reorganization plan for Eastern that involves any form of
control by Continental Holdings.
   The case began in 1988, when Eastern's three unions asked
the board to have Eastern and Continental declared one
carrier for labor purposes. It was the kickoff of a bruising
battle between Eastern and its unions.

   Americans may fret about Japanese making inroads into the
U.S. economy, but more and more U.S. entrepreneurs are
sighing with relief when they arrive.
   When Computed Anatomy Inc. desperately needed cash last
year, American investors proved useless. A small Japanese
corporation saved the day.
   The New York medical-equipment maker spent years seeking
funds from U.S. venture capitalists and "wasted tens of
thousands of dollars" to prepare presentations and reply to
questions, says Jeffrey Stewart, president.
   After the company received an "absurdly low" investment
offer from a U.S. venture capitalist, it turned to Toyo
Medical Co., Nagoya, a distributor of Computed Anatomy's
products in Asia, Mr. Stewart says. Toyo provided the funds
that Computed needed immediately to pay off its creditors --
and kicked in nearly $2 million in fresh capital.
   "Without the capital, we'd have had to shut down," Mr.
Stewart adds.
   Mr. Stewart has plenty of company. While the Japanese once
focused mainly on big American corporations, now one small
U.S. company after another finds that investors, major
suppliers -- and even owners -- come from Tokyo instead of
Toledo.
   Sometimes the relationships lead to fights, charges of
stolen technology and even total disruption of business. But
often, companies say Japanese investors are marching in where
American venture capitalists increasingly fear to tread. And
the Japanese frequently prove to be exceptionally helpful
investors, the Americans say.
   Publicly reported Japanese minority investments in U.S.
industrial companies with annual sales of under $100 million
soared to $320 million last year, up 82% from $176 million in
1988, says Venture Economics Inc., a Needham, Mass., research
and consulting firm.
   The Japanese "are filling a void left by U.S. venture
capital," says investment banker Sumiko Ito, head of the
Pacific Rim group at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc., Baltimore. From
1987 to 1989, venture-capital investments in smaller American
companies fell 17%, while the number of concerns getting
investments shrank 22%, Venture Economics says.
   Ms. Ito adds that not only are Japanese corporations
providing early-stage investments but also late-stage
financing, capital traditionally provided by big U.S.
corporations and insurers.
   In the early days of venture capital, small niche
companies such as Computed Anatomy would have been obvious
investments. The company, founded in 1981 by three
ophthalmologists at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, makes
machines that map the eye and was the only one of its kind.
It projected annual sales of $50 million within five years of
introducing the first product.
   But after financing the company through friends and
"angels," and developing the diagnostic machine, Computed
Anatomy's founders couldn't find money to fund the company's
growth and expansion. The company says it talked to nearly 50
venture-capital firms; almost all the discussions proved
abortive. One of New York's largest venture concerns talked
to Computed Anatomy for eight months before it decided that
the investment involved was too small. Another venture
concern, Euclid Partners Corp., New York, made an offer -- of
almost a third less than what the firm wanted. Finally,
Computed Anatomy signed the deal with Toyo.
   Indeed, Japanese often enter the scene only after U.S.
investors turn down the deal or offer too low a price.
   LTX Corp., a Westwood, Mass., maker of semiconductor test
equipment, raised $24 million in Japan only after it failed
to find investors here. "We'd have been hardpressed to raise
money at the price we did here in the U.S.," says John
Arcari, chief financial officer at LTX.
   After LTX's stock dropped to around $2 a share and the
value of the company stood at less than $50 million, LTX sold
a 15% stake to Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Tokyo, for $12
million -- almost twice the market value at the time.
Sumitomo also paid a further $12 million for a 49.5% stake in
LTX's Japanese operations. The entire LTX investment gives
Sumitomo a stake in a key semiconductor business.
   "The Japanese clearly are looking for new products and
technologies here," says Masazumi Ishii, a former McKinsey &amp;
Co. consultant, who now heads Azca Inc., a Redwood City,
Calif., consulting firm.
   "Japanese corporations are better organized to invest in
small companies than their U.S. and European counterparts,"
says venture capitalist Arthur Spinner of Hambro
International Venture Funds, New York. The Japanese
commitment to an investment usually comes from the top, he
notes. In U.S. and European corporations, investments in
small companies often are handled by a unit or division that
itself is straining to be noticed by the larger corporate
entity.
   Also, "it's easier to work with one Japanese corporate
investor" than a slew of U.S. venture capitalists, especially
when large amounts of capital are involved, says Mr. Spinner.
There's more risk in managing a syndicate of U.S. venture
capitalists with conflicting goals, than in a single Japanese
corporation that knows what it wants and is willing to stick
in there, he adds.
   The Japanese also have shown a willingness to keep their
hands off their investments. "They're giving us a lot of
latitude in the day-to-day running of our business and
developing our own business strategy," says Mr. Stewart of
Computed Anatomy. "A (U.S.) venture capitalist not only would
have wanted a bigger portion of our business, he would have
been here every day telling us how to run it."
   To some, this explains why the Japanese are welcomed by
U.S. entrepreneurs and are often happy to outbid American
investors.
   But for some U.S. companies, the Japanese thirst for
technology has led to miserable fights. Last month, the
founders of Stardent Computer Inc., a Silicon Valley
supercomputer company, sued Japan's Kubota Ltd., contending
that the Japanese manufacturing giant conspired to co-opt the
U.S. company's technology by using its investment in the
concern as leverage.
   Kubota characterizes the allegations as "bold-faced lies"
and claims entrepreneurs brought the charges only after their
private demand for a $7 million payment was refused.
   Most U.S. companies are making deals "for specific
applications and specific geographical territories" and
aren't giving away technology lock, stock and barrel, says
Paul Ferrari, editor of Corporate Venturing News, a Needham,
Mass., newsletter. Others add that young U.S. concerns are
getting the benefit of the know-how and marketing of large
Japanese corporations.
   Japan's Mitsui &amp; Co., for example, now is helping Digital
Radio Laboratories Inc., Carson, Calif., to make and
distribute hardware for its cable-based digital audio
service. For Digital, financing this aspect of the business
would cost more than $5 million, says venture capitalist
Robert Fleming, a Digital director.
   Digital had received over $7 million in financing from
U.S. investors to launch its service, which will allow
cable-TV system operators to provide digital audio sound to
their subscribers. But to make the hardware, Digital needed
more money. "It was too much money, too early, for venture
capitalists to finance and expect a decent return," says Mr.
Fleming.
   Similarly, Adaptive Solutions Inc., Beaverton, Ore., had
received about $1 million in seed financing from U.S. venture
capitalists. Then, it turned to Sharp Corp. and Mitsubishi
Electric Corp. to test and develop new uses for its neural
network computers, machines that mimic certain brain
functions.
   The Japanese "are being very deliberate about what they
are doing. By putting in small sums of money they are
controlling their risk," says Yutaka Fujiwara of MASI Ltd., a
Chicago investment banker. "As long as the financing gap
exists here and small U.S. companies meet strategic needs,
the investments will continue to increase."

   The President's Vacation
   Is Raising Some Eyebrows

   Although an overwhelming 72% of Americans back President
Bush's actions in the deserts of the Middle East, they're
less sure about his conduct in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Only 53% approved of his taking time to vacation at his
seacoast home just now, with 39% disapproving, in a poll
taken over the weekend before the hostage drama escalated.
Television news has juxtaposed Mr. Bush playing golf with
poignant interviews with relatives of Americans presumably
being held hostage.

   "I was saddened to see . . . Mr. Bush playing golf and
going fishing after having sent U.S. troops overseas," said
Lawrence Naumoff, 44, a Chapel Hill, N.C., novelist. "It was
a vision of the old-fashioned ugly American who doesn't
reflect on what his actions have caused."
   However, Edith Seibert, a housewife from Hermitage, Pa.,
said, "His mind is much clearer up there {in Maine} without
everybody in Washington beating on him to make a military
strike."
   Mr. Bush broke off his vacation for the second time
yesterday to meet with advisers in Washington, then returned
to Maine. The White House says that this is a working
vacation and that, thanks to sophisticated communications,
Mr. Bush can manage the nation's affairs as well in Maine as
in Washington.

   What Jesse Jackson's Up To
   ----

   Jacqueline Jackson, wife of Jesse Jackson, attended
Washington Mayor Marion Barry's drug and perjury trial in
early August, sitting next to Mr. Barry's wife. In June,
Jesse Jackson traveled to Memphis, where he spoke to a
congressional prayer breakfast sponsored by Rep. Harold Ford
(D., Tenn.). Mr. Ford is awaiting a retrial on bank fraud
charges, the first trial having ended in a hung jury. At the
prayer breakfast, Mr. Jackson said Mr. Ford should not be
tried again. "It is the Justice Department that is on trial,"
Mr. Jackson told the crowd of 1,500.
   In response to news reports of mass killings of civilians
in Liberia's civil war, Mr. Jackson appeared on television,
flanked by other black leaders, and called on the Bush
administration to take a more active role there. And Mr.
Jackson is running for the District of Columbia's "shadow"
Senate seat, a position created by the District's city
council to lobby Congress for D.C. statehood. If he wins, Mr.
Jackson says, he will seek access to the Senate floor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The common thread to these and other Jackson actions
during the past year or so is their popularity with blacks,
but not with whites. These actions confirm Sen. Ernest
Holling's (D., S.C.) description of Mr. Jackson's "Rainbow
coalition" as "the black-bow coalition." Mr. Jackson's
actions make little sense for someone running for president
of a nation that is only 12% black. But it makes a great deal
of sense for someone who wants to be a power-broker for the
black community -- especially when Mr. Jackson's role as the
pre-eminent black leader in the nation is being challenged,
at least in the mainstream/white media, by Gov. Douglas
Wilder of Virginia.
   Mr. Wilder's challenge to Mr. Jackson is based on his
demonstrated ability to win white votes. In response, Mr.
Jackson is saying, in effect, "Yes, but I am the leader of
black voters." Although Mr. Wilder has ordered Virginia's
state institutions to divest themselves of stock in
corporations that do business in South Africa, Mr. Wilder
cannot match Mr. Jackson in public gestures that appeal to
the black community. If Mr. Wilder made gestures of support
for Marion Barry and Harold Ford, it would alienate Mr.
Wilder's white supporters. By not worrying about his
popularity with whites, Mr. Jackson remains freer to say and
do things that appeal to blacks.
   In this way, Mr. Jackson hopes to make clear to the
national Democratic Party that it is he, and not Mr. Wilder,
who can keep black voters in the fold. Whether the Wilder or
Jackson approach -- getting on the inside and compromising or
staying on the outside and evangelizing -- better serves the
interests of the black community is open to debate. But if
Mr. Jackson's strategy succeeds, the Democratic Party could
face the same dilemma in 1992 it had in '84 and '88 --
appeasing a popular black leader at the expense of
much-needed white support.

   Questar Corp., an oil and gas concern based in Salt Lake
City, said it increased its expected capital expenditures for
this year to a record $160 million from its initial estimate
of about $140 million. The previous high is $146 million in
1982.
   A spokesman said the spending increase, which will mostly
go for petroleum reserve acquisitions and pipeline
construction, was in the works before Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait triggered higher oil prices. But he acknowledged that
turmoil in the Middle East "certainly re-enforced our
strategy of increasing oil and gas reserves."
</LP>

   Questar said it will finance the spending mainly through
internal sources of funds. It said the expenditures won't
have much effect on earnings in the short term.

   American Housing Trust VII -- $293 million of
mortgage-backed certificates, to be issued by the Department
of Veterans Affairs via First Boston Corp. and backed by
vendee loans. The deal, called a proportional coupon
allocation structure, is designed with two separate security
structures -- one single-class and one with multiple classes
-- with a range of average maturities. As investor demand
increases or decreases during the marketing period for the
single-class certificates, the proportion of par amount in
each of the two structures will be adjusted up or down
acccordingly. Details of the planned offering weren't
immediately available. This is the seventh in a series of
securitized offerings by the Veterans Affairs Department
since 1988. Vendee loans are loans issued to finance the sale
of VA-owned properties acquired as a result of VA loan
defaults. The VA originates approximately $50 million to $70
million of such loans each month.

   Mutual Funds:
   At Fidelity, the Hunt for Stock-Pickers Begins at Home

   BOSTON -- When Harris Leviton was looking for an analyst's
job in 1987, he jumped at the chance to work for Fidelity
Investments, the U.S.'s largest mutual fund group.
   "Some of the other places I interviewed wouldn't let you
near money for three or four years, sometimes even a decade,"
says Mr. Leviton, who was recently chosen to run the $62
million Fidelity Convertible Securities fund.

   Not so at Fidelity, where an analyst often is running one
of Fidelity's 38 Select portfolios within two years of
arriving at the Boston-based firm. Select portfolios, which
are volatile mutual funds that invest in a single industry,
are one of the fund industry's most controversial products.
But for young analysts eager to manage money, they are a
godsend.
   The Select funds are part of Fidelity's strategy for
attracting and nurturing novice stock pickers. William Hayes,
the firm's director of fixed-income research, says: "You're
not going to sit on the bench for years, hoping that some
senior portfolio manager is going to get hit by a bus."
   The prevailing assumption at Fidelity is that if you hire
analysts who are young and bright and give them lots of
responsibility, and if they work harder than the competition,
this will translate into better performance for Fidelity's
stock funds.
   Now that top stock-picker Peter Lynch has retired as fund
manager of Fidelity Magellan, the quality of Fidelity's
research department is more important than ever. Fidelity
needs to convince investors that -- even without Mr. Lynch --
the firm can continue to generate stellar investment results.
   Fidelity does attract "younger, more aggressive, more
arrogant people who are very smart," says Eric Kobren, editor
of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter on Fidelity
published in Wellesley, Mass. "They attract a Morris Smith
{the new manager of Fidelity Magellan} or a Beth Terrana
{manager of Fidelity Growth &amp; Income}, who are in their early
30s and work 80 hours a week and are constantly on airplanes
flying off to visit companies."
   All told, Fidelity's stock-picking department employs 105
analysts and fund managers. According to Fidelity, that makes
it the country's largest "buy-side" research department.
   But is Fidelity's research department really that good? If
the performance of Fidelity's stock funds is any guide, it
seems so. Kanon Bloch Carre &amp; Co., a Boston mutual-fund
research firm, puts Fidelity in the top 10% of all fund
groups, based on the performance of its stock funds over one,
three, five and 10 years. Kanon Bloch's ratings give equal
weighting to all funds, so the results aren't skewed by
Magellan's huge size.
   Fidelity Select was the brainchild of Edward C. Johnson
III, chairman and owner of 47% of closely held Fidelity
Investments. His daughter, Abigail, now manages two Select
portfolios. Mr. Lynch, who initially oversaw the Select funds
as head of the growth stock group, was one of Select's
earliest backers.
   Since Fidelity launched its first four Select portfolios
in 1981, they have often been criticized as poor investment
vehicles. Because Select portfolios concentrate on a single
industry, the funds frequently are volatile. They often grace
the top of the quarterly and one-year fund performance charts
-- but can also be found languishing at the bottom. Despite
criticism, Fidelity has continued to add Select portfolios,
arguing that the funds are useful for those who want to
invest actively in the stock market without actually picking
stocks.
   "From a public relations standpoint, it's done some
damage," says Mr. Kobren, the newsletter writer. "But it's
also attracted a new breed of fund investor who was
previously at Merrill Lynch buying individual stocks."
   As a way of attracting new investors, the Select funds
have only been a modest success. The funds range in size from
the $313 million Health fund to Life Insurance and
Automotive, with assets of only $500,000 each. Fidelity
Magellan, by contrast, boasts $13 billion in assets. In all,
the Select funds account for less than 6% of Fidelity's total
stock fund assets of $43 billion.
   But pulling in money isn't the only role for the Select
funds. They also act as a proving ground for Fidelity's
analysts and generate investment ideas that can be used by
the stock-pickers who run Fidelity's large, diversified stock
funds. The Select portfolios are managed by 25 fund managers,
mostly young analysts whom Fidelity has recruited from the
top business schools. Fidelity analysts have an average age
of 33 and typically start at salaries of $55,000 or $60,000 a
year.
   For Select managers, the ultimate goal is to run one of
the big, diversified mutual funds. Many young analysts "think
they'll blow the world away," says Fidelity's Mr. Hayes, who
is heavily involved in recruiting new analysts. "If you
really are that good, you will move up quickly here."
   There are two ways for Select managers to stand out. One
way is to turn in a good performance with their Select fund.
Because a Select manager's fate is closely tied to his
sector, the fund's performance is rated by comparing it with
a benchmark index for the sector.
   But far more important are the investment ideas that a
Select manager feeds to the managers of Fidelity's large,
diversified funds. Fidelity's analysts provide around half
the stock ideas used by the bigger funds.
   A Select fund manager "who sits in their office and beats
their benchmark by 90% a year but doesn't talk to the
diversified fund managers isn't doing us any good at all,"
says Richard Spillane, who oversees the Select funds. "The
worst thing is if they have a great stock in their Select
fund and they don't tell the diversified fund managers."
   At Fidelity, a new analyst doesn't sit on the sidelines
for long. "My second week here, I walked into Peter Lynch's
office," recalls Lawrence Bowman, who manages two Select
portfolios, computers and technology. "He was a god to me. I
walked in and said, `I think you should buy this stock.' He
picked up the phone and bought some right there. It blew me
away."
   Not all Mr. Bowman's picks have panned out. A year ago, he
had been recommending Sun Microsystems Inc. when the earnings
outlook turned sour and Sun slipped from $23 a share to below
$13.50. "We were loaded to the gills," recalls Mr. Bowman.
"We owned a couple of million of shares going into this. I
loved it. I was sure I was right."
   But Mr. Bowman adds: "There isn't a person here who hasn't
made a big mistake."
   At Fidelity, picking a few bum stocks is expected. Not
admitting to mistakes is another matter. "What portfolio
managers don't like is that you put them in a stock and then
it goes down and you don't talk about it," says Deborah
Wheeler, who runs Fidelity Select-Retail. "Peter {Lynch}
hated that."
   A Select manager's biggest headache used to be managing
the fund's cash flow, as shareholders rushed to withdraw
money or bought in like crazy. Ms. Wheeler was running Select
Housing when the bond market tanked in April 1987. Over the
next month, investors -- fearful that a spike in interest
rates would damage home sales -- redeemed away half of the
fund's $50 million in assets.
   Last November, Fidelity moved to curb big cash movements
by charging $7.50 plus a 0.75% redemption fee for switches
made within 29 days. Cash flows now are far less drastic, but
Select managers still have to suffer through nail-biting
market swings.
   "We all commiserate when our sector is doing poorly, and
we have fun when our sector is doing well," says Lawrence
Greenberg, who runs two Select portfolios and is an assistant
to Magellan's Morris Smith. "There's only so much you can do
when your sector is in the tank."
   Fidelity already offers small investors 80 stock funds,
but the firm will have to add more if it's going to
accommodate the aspirations of Mr. Greenberg and other Select
managers. Mr. Hayes, the director of fixed-income research,
says that won't be a problem. He predicts that, just as there
now are funds that invest in distinct parts of the U.S. stock
market, so that sort of specialization is likely to spread
among funds that invest abroad.
   Even with Mr. Lynch gone, Mr. Hayes figures Fidelity will
go on producing stellar results. He likes to point out that
Fidelity (or Fido, as the firm is known among employees) has
survived the departure of other top stock-pickers. When Mr.
Hayes joined in 1969, the company was still feeling the loss
of star fund manager Gerald Tsai, who had left three years
earlier to start his own fund.
   "Gerry Tsai was the wunderkind at Fidelity in the 1960s,"
Mr. Hayes recalls. "When I arrived here, people were
wondering what would happen to Fidelity after Gerald Tsai.
Peter {Lynch} was a singular dimension at Fidelity. But life
goes on."

   K mart Corp., citing increased sales and "careful
monitoring" of expenses, said its second-quarter earnings
rose 2.1% to $148 million, or 74 cents a share, from $145
million, or 72 cents a share.
   Sales for the quarter ended Aug. 1 rose 11% to $7.78
billion from $7.01 billion a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The discount retailer said that despite a relatively weak
retail environment, its earnings improved as increased sales
and expense monitoring offset higher interest expense and the
reduction in gross margins from the lowering of prices. K
mart, which is based in Troy, Mich., said it was particularly
encouraged by the strength in apparel sales as well as strong
sales of seasonal merchandise.
   In the first six months, K mart earned $248.1 million, or
$1.24 a share, compared with $239.1 million, or $1.19 a
share, a year earlier. Sales rose 13% to $14.83 billion from
$13.07 billion.

   Tensions Mount
   In Israel as Crisis
   In Gulf Escalates

   TEL AVIV -- Israelis flocked as usual to the azure waters
of the Mediterranean here, but beneath the colorful beach
umbrellas the talk seemed to be of only one subject: war.
   "It feels like the quiet before the storm," said Orly
Vilenski, 26 years old, applying a coat of suntan lotion
before attending to the pressing issues of geopolitics. "Me,
I'm not worried, because I'm going with my whole family on
holiday to New York next week. But my friends have been
joking that we should call first before coming home, just to
make sure Israel still exists."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With gallows humor, macho swagger, and carefully phrased
official statements, Israel is walking a fine line between
preparedness and panic as the escalation in the Persian Gulf
continues.
   During the weekend, tension mounted when two armed
Jordanian soldiers, described by Israel's government radio
station as "Moslem extremists who hoped to carry out an
attack on Israel in solidarity with Saddam Hussein,"
infiltrated Israel's border. Israeli army troops killed one
and wounded the other, who was taken for questioning.
Jordan's Radio Amman noted that the two soldiers had been
"missing from base," suggesting their absence was
unauthorized.
   The incident served to underline Israel's sense of
vulnerability. Israeli officials, who had been striving with
U.S. encouragement to maintain a low profile in an effort not
to be drawn into the Gulf conflict, began to sound more
alarmist.
   "Personally," said a senior government official who asked
not to be named, "I now think there will have to be a war."
He added, "It's getting more and more dangerous every day.
The entire region is now a powder keg." Israel's
government-run radio news sounded a similar note, stating
that "senior government officials" have concluded that "war
in the Gulf is now inevitable."
   These officials argue that given his past record, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein is unlikely to respond to diplomatic
overtures or to be frightened by military deterrents. But the
Israeli analysis may be colored by the preference of many
officials that Saddam Hussein be eliminated from Middle East
politics -- especially if it can be done by a nation other
than Israel.
   A number of senior Israeli officials, particularly in the
Defense Ministry, hope that the U.S. will conduct massive air
and missile strikes against Iraq. The alternative -- a slow
war of nerves -- may allow further spread of Arab nationalism
and unrest, increasing the likelihood of instability in such
moderate Arab states as Jordan, they argue.
   "The West must stop {Saddam Hussein}" argued one such
senior Israeli official. "Otherwise he will simply try this
again in another eight years."
   Some Israeli officials worry that Saddam Hussein, if
cornered, may see an attack on Israel as his best shot at
uniting Arab allies. One official calls this the "Samson and
Delilah scenario," in which Saddam Hussein pulls the pillars
down on all his enemies rather than surrender.
   Whether Israel might be drawn into any military conflict
is a matter of debate here. Military analysts and
policy-makers believe Saddam Hussein would like to portray
his invasion of Kuwait as an Arab fight against Israel. They
are determined not to give him the opportunity, unless Iraq
threatens Israel directly or places troops in Jordan. In an
attempt to appear uninvolved and peaceful, Israel hasn't
called up most of its military reserves, though officials
confirm that some air force reservists were called into
service and that anti-missile batteries have been massed on
the Jordanian border.
   The army has also refused to distribute gas masks to
civilians, despite a clamor from those fearing Iraqi chemical
warfare. Some Israeli politicians, including Foreign Minister
David Levy, have called for immediate distribution. An
Israeli lawyer frustrated by the army's refusal took the
issue to court, where a judge will decide on it later this
week.
   Meanwhile local papers have begun to carry accounts of
runs on baking soda, a homemade remedy against poisonous gas,
as well as accounts of people stocking up on such staples as
rice, sugar and oil. One newspaper, Yediot Ahronot, alerted
readers to such early signs of chemical attack as the sudden
death of "foliage and small pets."
   At the beach here, people most fear the threat of chemical
weapons. Yuda Baker, a Tel Aviv diamond merchant, worries
that gas masks will be distributed only to soldiers. "I want
my family and other civilians protected," he says. "They may
be in real trouble."
   Tippi Wall, 32, a teacher, says, "I think war is coming.
Every day I have more and more fear. It's getting very hot."
Calling for a pre-emptive strike, as do many on the beach,
she says, "I think we should attack Iraq first. Saddam
Hussein is a murderer. He wants to rule the whole Arab
world."
   Up in the lifeguards' hut, the mood is even more macho.
Ron Wohlberg, 32, flexes his biceps and from the shade of his
sunglasses suggests, "I'm not afraid, why should I be? I
think Saddam Hussein will lose. The Americans will finish him
off. And if they don't, we will."
   Betty Merion, a tourist from Philadelphia, doesn't want to
take any chances. "It's been a great trip," she says, "but
I'm happy to be going home. We've been lucky, but I don't
want to push my luck."

   Frederick "Fritz" Bensusan, a 28-year-old credit manager
in Santa Cruz, Calif., approves completely of President
Bush's handling of the Middle East crisis. "I think he has
done everything right," he says.
   But Mr. Bensusan is convinced that before it's over, there
will be loss of life. "We'll see some kind of military
action" soon, he believes, because "violence is a pattern for
the area." And he worries that here at home, the crisis will
provoke a recession.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bensusan's comments mirror the opinions and emotions
of American voters sampled in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC
News poll. The scientific telephone poll was supplemented by
face-to-face interviews, which show that Americans' support
for President Bush is stalwart -- and their pessimism about
quick success in the operation deep-seated.
   Overwhelmingly -- by 72% to 16% -- Americans continue to
back Mr. Bush's handling of the confrontation in the Middle
East, almost three weeks after Iraq's lightning seizure of
oil-rich Kuwait. By almost the same margin, they approve of
his decision to send military forces to Saudi Arabia and the
Persian Gulf. And more than two-thirds of them say they are
willing to see those Americans fight under any of the most
likely scenarios.
   At the same time, these voters entertain no notions that
any of this is going to be easy. They believe that the U.S.
holds the upper hand so far. But a plurality, 42% of them,
believe the U.S. will end up in a war with Iraq.
   And in a rapid shift unusual in polling history, Americans
now conclude, 57% to 26%, that there will be a recession in
the U.S. sometime during the next 12 months. Only a month
ago, Americans believed by a lopsided 49% to 25% that there
wouldn't be one. This extraordinary turnaround, occurring at
a time of surging gasoline prices, is clearly a result of the
unfolding events in the Middle East.
   "So far, the public is pretty much of one mind. They've
concluded we've done the right thing and they back the
president by a large margin," say Peter Hart and Robert
Teeter, who conducted the poll for the Journal and NBC.
   Besides backing the general Bush approach, Americans
appear willing to commit U.S. forces to battle, particularly
if U.S. security or American hostages are at stake. If Iraq
were to invade Saudi Arabia, 74% of the poll's respondents
would support military action. Nearly as many would support a
combat role for American forces if Iraq imprisons or
mistreats Americans living in Kuwait. And 61% say they would
support an invasion of Iraq itself to try to force the
release of the hostages.
   The pollsters say they rarely have seen a survey where the
American public supported committing military forces to
battle before the fighting had actually begun. "If there is a
short message being sent to Iraq's Saddam Hussein," the
pollsters say, "it reads: `Don't mess with us.'"
   Thus, President Hussein's efforts to divide American
public opinion clearly aren't working; this poll was
conducted 2 1/2 weeks after the crisis began Aug. 2, meaning
that unlike earlier surveys, this one permitted respondents a
chance to think things through. "This is a reflective opinion
vs. the earlier reflexive opinions," say Mr. Hart, a
Democratic pollster, and Mr. Teeter, a Republican.
   But Americans are less inclined to go to war with Iraq
over economic questions, even over matters so critical as
Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti oil. If the price of gasoline
should surge to $2 a gallon, only 27% say the American
response should be military action.
   "That's not worth fighting for," says Linda Nidetz, a
34-year-old part-time legal secretary from Glenview, Ill.
"We've had gas shortages before."
   "The American voters are being very discriminating," the
two pollsters agree.
   Normally, Americans pull together, at least initially,
when their troops are committed to dangerous missions abroad.
President Reagan scored high marks for intervening in Grenada
and Mr. Bush for ousting Panama's Manuel Noriega.
   But those patriotic surges can sour if the news from the
battlefield is bad, or if the conflict shows no signs of
coming to a successful conclusion. Vietnam, of course, is the
most searing example, one that continues to burn in the minds
of Americans. "After Vietnam, I can't think of hardly
anything that's worth starting a war over," says Annette
Burt, a 40-year-old airline employee from Linden, N.J.
   But a more apt comparison may be President Truman's
intervention in 1950 to prevent South Korea from being
overrun by North Korea's powerful army.
   The American army then fought under a United Nations flag,
with U.S. Allies giving the effort limited support.
Initially, according to historical Gallup poll data,
Americans supported defending South Korea by 65% to 20% --
not so different from their current feelings about Kuwait.
But as the North Koreans overran the Allied troops, sentiment
changed. In just four months, between September 1950 and
January 1951, opinion turned around even as the news was
getting better -- until half of the American public concluded
it had been a mistake after all. Dwight Eisenhower was
elected president in 1952 on his implied promise to end the
Korean fighting.
   So far, the President's strategy of Middle East
intervention wins the support of a broad range of Americans
-- men and women, older and younger, Democratic and
Republican. Pollsters Teeter and Hart note that 62% of the
women responding support sending troops to the Middle East
(and 68% support the president's handling of the crisis).
   The one exception is blacks. Only 41% (against 74% for
white voters) approve of sending combat forces to the Middle
East.
   Priorities also are a concern to Delia Realmo, a
high-school history teacher in Chicago's predominantly
Mexican-American Little Village neighborhood. "We have a
health-care crisis, a measles epidemic and things the rest of
the country doesn't even think about," she says, expressing
reservations about the use of force in the Middle East.
   Americans who support Mr. Bush rarely express doubts about
the mission itself. Nancy Calhoun, a 46-year-old town
supervisor in Blooming Grove, N.Y., notes that she has a son
serving as a Navy pilot. "That's why my son is there {in the
Navy}; it is a stand for democracy and a stand for the
world," she says.
   "I'd throw the H-bomb at them," says Jerome Cummisky, a
79-year-old retired real estate and insurance agent from
Madison Lake, Minn.
   But there is an undercurrent, both in the poll and in the
interviews, that this operation won't be an easy one to
conclude successfully. While approving the concept, people
wonder about the execution.
   "I think the worst is perhaps ahead of us," says Gary
Patton, a 46-year-old lawyer in Santa Cruz.
   "It's really a scary, scary situation," says Pamela
Jenkins, 35, an office supervisor at Burnside Coal &amp; Oil in
the Bronx borough of New York City. "I think a guy who used
chemical warfare on his own people just doesn't value human
life, and that may get us into terrible trouble."
   "I think it's going to escalate to an armed conflict,"
says Robert O'Leary, a 36-year-old insurance salesman from
Walden, N.Y. "Our hostages are history."
   In the poll, Americans are almost evenly divided on
whether they think the crisis will lead to combat, 42% saying
it will and 40% expecting the U.S. to achieve its objectives
short of war.
   By the same token, people are somewhat doubtful that
economic sanctions and a blockade will enable the U.S. to
achieve its objectives, with 43% saying those actions will
work and 37% saying they won't.
   They tend to support some options a lot more heavily than
others. Calling up National Guard and Reserve units wins
broad approval, with more than three-quarters in support.
Blockading Jordan, if it doesn't go along with economic
sanctions, is popular too, with 59% in support.
   What happens to American hostages clearly will be a major
factor in framing public opinion. Americans feel so strongly
about this that 61% say they would support invading Iraq --
an immense military challenge -- to force Saddam Hussein to
free Americans.
   But while an overwhelming majority would agree to an
invasion of Iraq for this purpose, a much smaller majority
supports the idea of cutting off food to Iraq to the point
that innocent civilians would go hungry. Black voters, again,
part company, with only 37% supporting the idea of shutting
down food supplies to Iraq, compared with 58% of whites in
support.
   Americans worry about the hostages abroad; at home, they
worry about a recession.
   Pollsters Teeter and Hart say they are stunned by the
turnaround in economic opinion, with 57% of Americans now
believing there will be a recession in the next 12 months.
   "The economy's been teetering on the edge for some time,
and this crisis will probably put the economy over the edge,"
says Jim Lufty, who owns a card shop in Traverse City, Mich.
   Pessimism about the economy is widely distributed.
Pollsters find that black voters tend to be more pessimistic
about the direction the economy is going than white voters,
but in this poll white voters are just as pessimistic.
   And when it comes to assigning blame for the surge in
gasoline prices, there is little doubt in these people's
minds. U.S. oil companies are blamed by 70% of the
respondents -- and Saddam Hussein by only 13%.

   Medicine:
   Drug to Reverse
   Organ Rejection
   Shows Promise

   A drug that could revolutionize the organ transplant field
continues to show high success rates in new studies.
   The drug, known as FK506, often reverses advanced
rejection, lowers the occurence of infection, virtually
eliminates hypertension and reduces the instance of kidney
failure more effectively than traditional immunosuppressive
therapies, like cyclosporine, researchers said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The drug is metabolized from a soil fungus found in Japan.
It could expand both the availability and success of
complicated organ transplants. Rejection has been the major
obstacle in the approximately 30,000 organ transplants
performed worldwide each year. Many patients require repeat
operations because of the rejection problem.
   The successful experiments are good news to the drug's
manufacturer, Japan's Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., which
discovered the drug in 1984.
   Results of several studies conducted between February 1989
and June 1990 were disclosed at the International Congress of
the Transplantation Society in San Francisco. The research on
FK506 was headed by Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, director of the
University of Pittsburgh Transplantation Program.
   With FK506, researchers hope that patients "won't require
a second or third transplant," said Dr. Andreas Tzakis, a
transplant surgeon at the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center. "With the scarcity of organs for children, this drug
may result in organs available for a large number of
children."
   Dr. Tzakis, who studied 42 children who had undergone
liver, heart, kidney and other transplants, found that high
doses of steroids required with cyclosporine were unnecessary
with FK506, eliminating problems of stunted growth and facial
puffiness. In addition, he found that organs failing on
cyclosporine could be salvaged by giving the patient FK506.
   In a study on adult patients who received heart
transplants, researchers reported that 26 out of 30 patients
who used the drug are experiencing excellent cardiac
function, with few instances of rejection or infection.
   In that study, researchers said they were also surprised
by the decrease in deaths due to atherosclerosis, a hardening
of the arteries accompanied by small fatty deposits on artery
walls. Researchers believe that FK506 curbs the incidence of
hypertension and prevents a condition called hyperlipidemia,
a buildup of excessive fat in the blood.
   A common complication for all organ transplants treated
with cyclosporine is hypertension, which is virtually
eliminated with FK506.
   In another study on 125 liver transplant patients,
researchers said that fewer than 40% of the patients
experienced rejection, compared with a 70% rejection rate for
patients treated with cyclosporine and other traditional
therapies.
   Dr. Mario Alessiani, a fellow at the University of
Pittsburgh, said infection remains a major obstacle. "As it
stands, patients are still experiencing the same types of
infections common in cyclosporine patients, but some
(infections) appear less frequently and tend to be less
severe."
   The drug, which is still in its experimental phase, hasn't
been approved yet by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
and its long-term effects are still unknown. Clinical trials
began at University of Pittsburgh in 1989, and surgeons have
given the drug to about 800 patients, who have received
transplanted livers, hearts, kidneys, pancreatic islet cells,
lungs and various combinations of these organs.

   NEVADA POWER Co. (Las Vegas, Nev.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it lowered its ratings on about $260
million of this utility's debt. The rating concern said
Nevada Power probably will have to borrow heavily over the
next five years to fund a major expansion program, and it
cited the utility's recent rate decreases. Moody's downgraded
its ratings on Nevada Power's first-mortgage bonds and
secured pollution-control bonds to Baa-1 from single-A-2,
unsecured pollution-control bonds to Baa-2 from single-A-3,
and commercial paper to prime-2 from prime-1. Richard Hyte,
Nevada Power's chief financial officer, said the utility's
explosive customer growth is straining its cash flow.
"Funding for heavy construction requirements and increasing
customer service costs will need to come, in part, from
future rate increases," he said. Nevada Power said its
capital outlays increased to $120 million last year from $50
million three years ago. It said its capital budget probably
will increase 38% this year, and will average $200 million
for each of the next three years.

   Computer Associates International Inc. said it will buy
back as many as 15 million shares, or about 8% of its common
stock, on the open market.
   A disappointing revenue and earnings forecast July 12
knocked nearly 40% off the giant software company's indicated
value. Yesterday, Computer Associates stock rose 75 cents in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, to close at
$7.125 -- still 56.8% below its July 11 closing price of
$16.50.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Garden City, N.Y., company's president, Anthony Wang,
said he considered the company's shares a good value. "We've
done many software acquisitions in years past, and very
seldom have we had the chance to buy a company at less than
one times revenue," he said.
   At its closing price Friday, Computer Associates had an
indicated market value slightly below its revenue of $1.3
billion for the fiscal year ended March 31.
   Computer Associates, once a high-flier in the computer
industry, hit the wall a year ago because of trouble handling
a large acquisition. In recent months, the company had
reported that those problems were behind it and restored some
of its credibility.

   REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   The Jogger and Gun Control

   The jury has spoken in the jogger case with a verdict that
underscores the disconnection between the common sense of the
people and the accepted wisdom of the political and
intellectual elites. The jury never considered that somehow
socioeconomic, racial or other factors could excuse the evil
committed on a woman by rampaging young men that night in New
York's Central Park. And to the degree that the punishments
are remarkably light, the fault lies not with the jury but
with the state's permissive criminal-justice system.
   The general outlines of the crimes are by now well known.
A group of some 30 teen-agers entered the park one evening in
April 1989. At least six robbed several passers-by, and
savagely beat and raped a then 28-year-old investment banker.
The jogger was so brutally attacked that she lost
three-quarters of her blood. One eyeball exploded in the back
of her head. Her white sweat shirt was left crimson. She was
bound in her own clothing and left for dead.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Descriptions of the jury deliberations make clear that the
jurors approached their task in a commonsense way. Jury
foreman Earle Fisher saw to it at the beginning that the
issue that monopolized attention outside the courtroom would
play no role in the jury room.
   Mr. Fisher, a black law graduate, says, "One of the first
things the jury did was decide the very first statements out
of our mouths in that jury room would be whether we believed
race was an issue. The first thing we did in the jury room
was to decide whether or not this case had racial overtones,
and we decided it did not. That cleared the air." The jury
was made up of four blacks, four whites, three Hispanics and
one Asian.
   We also do not believe, by the way, that race was the
major factor in the recent mixed-verdict trial of Washington
Mayor Marion Barry. We can understand a jury deciding to
convict Mr. Barry on one drug count because he was so
obviously guilty, but also deciding not to pile on. This was
a case against a political figure based on actions only
indirectly related to his official duties. The U.S. Attorney
was right to bring the case, but the jury crafted a rough
justice with a verdict to stop Mr. Barry from running for
re-election as mayor and stop him from claiming vindication.
   The evident common sense of the jury in discounting the
race issue suggests how far much of the elite liberal culture
has drifted from the general public. Whenever one of these
events happens now, it immediately becomes the sole property
of politicians, poseurs, intellectuals and the media. It is
really quite striking to read in the verdict's aftermath how
many of the people interviewed in the defendants' own
neighborhood felt that a serious wrong had been committed and
deserved sanction. For the record, the last juror holding out
against conviction was a white male journalist.
   The jury cannot be blamed for the light sentences. Many
states, including New York, treat criminals with adult-sized
bodies and pure evil intent as if they were merely
mischievous adolescents. This became relevant when the jury
convicted the teenagers of assault and rape but could not
find the required intent to convict on the attempted-murder
charge. The irony is that the punishment would not have been
any greater if the three had been convicted on the
attempted-murder charge. As juveniles, the maximum they can
serve is between five and 10 years. As adults, they would
have faced 16 to 50 years.
   They are called "juveniles," but Yusef Salaam is 16 years
old, 6 feet 4 inches tall and 150 pounds. Raymond Santana is
15, 5 feet 5 inches and 135 pounds. Antron McCray is 16, 5
feet 4 inches and 135 pounds. Whether we call them juveniles
or adults, the 5-foot-5-inch, 105-pound jogger had no chance.
Indeed, one of the others they beat up that night was a
6-foot-4-inch former Marine.
   Nor are the three bound for any serious prison. Juvenile
offenders in New York, even felons, still go to reform
schools. They will be supervised by a counselor and spend
seven hours a day in school. Most facilities have swimming
pools, several athletic fields and indoor gyms.
   The same political culture that treats felons gingerly
because of their age has now spent the summer agitating that
the crime problem can be solved by extending New York's
strict gun-control laws nationally. The newspapers and
politicians peddling the argument that guns are the key to
the crime problem might spend a moment reviewing the weapons
used in Central Park. The jogger was attacked with (1) a
pipe, (2) a rock, (3) a stick, (4) a brick, (5) punching
fists and (6) kicking feet. No gun, automatic or manual,
imported or domestic.
   The jogger jury had an immediate concern far removed from
racial politics or gun control. The jurors had to confront
the lawlessness that affects all big-city residents,
minorities most of all. The jury ultimately concerned itself
with the most basic questions of crime, punishment and civil
order. The jury repeated a central but too often fudged
lesson of our advanced civilization, that individuals who
commit evil acts must be punished.
   The jury did its job. Now the political elites should
recognize that deterrence is an even better policy than
punishment alone. Justice requires preventing these kinds of
brutal acts from being committed in the first place. We will
know there is deterrence when criminals and citizens alike
are no longer surprised when wrongdoers are routinely
arrested, convicted and punished.

   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. boosted anticipated outlays for the
first-stage construction of its planned Lilly Technology
Center in Indianapolis, to $540 million from about $185
million.
   The pharmaceutical giant said the technology center will
house current production and distribution operations, and
bring together labs and related activities involved in
developing production processes for new pharmaceutical
products.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the plan, Lilly will build a $120 million
biotechnology development laboratory, and will spend $145
million on other projects by 1994, in addition to $90 million
for infrastructure work.
   Also to be included at the center are a previously
announced $150 million facility for producing the company's
synthetic human insulin product, and a $35 million
administrative building.
   A Lilly spokesman said the second phase of the project,
set for the latter half of the decade, will boost the
expenditures to more than $1 billion.
   The technology center is separate from Lilly's cross-town
headquarters and basic-research labs, where a previously
announced $415 million expansion project is also under way.

   AMMAN, Jordan -- Although guns remain holstered in the
Persian Gulf, analysts in Jordan are writing obituaries for
certain players. Counted among the dead are U.S. influence in
the region and the stability of the Jordanian state.
   "Whatever happens, America is finished in the Middle
East," says Taher Masri, a former Jordanian foreign minister
and leading member of Parliament. Mr. Masri, one of the most
moderate and articulate voices in Amman, outlines a lose-lose
scenario for the U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If Iraqi President Saddam Hussein weathers the crisis, Mr.
Masri says, his prestige and power will be so great that such
current foes as Egypt and Saudi Arabia will fall into line,
through fear of Iraq or of their own populations. Saddam
Hussein is seen extending his hegemony in Yemen and Jordan,
giving him a choke point on the Red Sea and a long border
with Israel. "He will be a Gamel Nasser with teeth," Mr.
Masri says.
   If Saddam Hussein is defeated or deposed, Jordanians see
dire consequences for the U.S. A man widely perceived by the
Arab masses as a "nationalist hero" will have been martyred
by "Western imperialism," Mr. Masri says, and "the gap
between Arab leaders and their people -- already wide -- will
become even wider." Wrath now directed at the U.S. will be
discharged at home, threatening many regimes.
   Mr. Masri and other analysts have no doubt who will
benefit: fundamentalists, terrorists and radical Arab
nationalists. "The U.S. may clobber Saddam," says one source
close to the palace, "but it won't be left with many regimes
in the region to defend." Analysts say that the large
Palestinian population in Gulf states, particularly Saudi
Arabia, could become a vehicle for terror and instability.
   Asad Abdul Rahman, a member of both the Arab Organization
for Human Rights and the Palestine National Council, thinks
the damage already has been done to the U.S. and its allies.
"A moderate like myself can no longer even talk about ethics
or international law," he says. "Arab dignity is all anyone
cares about."
   He believes most Arabs have accepted that Saddam Hussein
likely will lose. But even if the odds are three to one
against Iraq, "Arabs still say, `I'll take my chances,'" he
says. "The attitude is, `Let him die, let us all die, but at
least someone stood up to the U.S.'"
   Saddam Hussein's defeat would only deepen this nihilism
and anger, Mr. Rahman believes. "All America would win is the
enmity of millions of Arabs. It might take a few years, but
the fallout will be turmoil and terror."
   Passion already is near the breaking point in Amman. When
a leading imam tried to justify Saudi Arabia's stance in a
sermon, he was booed out of the pulpit -- a show of
disrespect that Jordanians say is almost unheard of in Amman.
Pro-Iraq rallies continue daily, and trucks of riot police
are posted by the U.S. Embassy and at major intersections.
Two conscripts in the Jordanian army infiltrated the
Israeli-occupied West Bank, apparently on their own
initiative. One was killed and the other captured.
   A Westerner working for a government agency returned from
vacation to find his co-workers doing nothing but arguing
politics. "Twenty percent want to flee Jordan," he says, "and
the other 80% want to go to holy war."
   This feverish pro-Iraq sentiment creates what one
ambassador in Amman calls "the king's conundrum." If King
Hussein accedes to Western pressure and imposes trade
sanctions on Iraq, "the anger at home would be off the
screen," the diplomat says. But if the king defies the U.S.
and supports Baghdad, he will incur isolation abroad and
economic ruin at home, possibly within several months. "The
king," says the ambassador, "is really facing the crunch."
   The Gulf crisis is a triple hit to Jordan's stumbling
economy. Remittances from the 300,000 or more Jordanians
working in Kuwait have been made almost worthless, and the
future of Jordanians working in other Gulf states is in
doubt. Economic aid from Kuwait is gone, and other Gulf
states are likely to repay Amman for its support of Baghdad
by ending their aid as well. And traffic at the port of
Aqaba, from which goods are trucked to Iraq, is dwindling
fast as suppliers stop loading goods bound for Iraq.
   If Jordan cuts off the rest of its trade with Iraq, "the
economy would effectively come to a standstill," says the
king's brother, Crown Prince Hassan. Jordan sends 25% of its
exports to Iraq and receives 90% of its oil from Baghdad, for
free as repayment for credits that Amman extended during the
Iran-Iraq war. If this trade were halted, bankers say Jordan
would be unable to service its foreign debt of $9 billion,
and unemployment could soar.
   Cutting trade with Iraq is even less palatable
politically. "The king would be perceived as stabbing Saddam
and the Arab cause in the back," says one Western diplomat.
One sign of sensitivity about the king's image is the return
of censorship after months of emerging democracy and freedom
of the press in Jordan. Issues of Time magazine arrived on
Amman newstands this weekend with several pages cut out. The
censored material included a phrase saying that King Hussein
is "known locally for having `changed his skin a million
times.'"
   This chameleon quality has helped the king survive
repeated threats during his 37-year reign. And in recent
weeks, he has been at it again, standing by Iraq in one
breath and hedging his support in the next. He didn't condemn
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but he didn't recognize the
Iraqi-installed government, either. He says Jordan will
comply with United Nations trade sanctions, but says study of
the details still is needed -- and in the meantime, trucks
continue to roll across the Iraqi border.
   But as tensions in the Gulf heighten each day, the king
may have to take a stand. Few here doubt that he will stick
with Saddam Hussein, forgoing Western aid and risking a
blockade of Aqaba.
   Jordanians say they would rather starve than switch sides.
Digging his fingers into a traditional weekend lunch of lamb,
rice and nuts, Nasser Lattouf reminds a Western visitor that
"our grandparents lived for centuries on milk and dates." The
pharmacist adds, "a little hunger will just make us feel
we're contributing to Saddam's struggle."

   Recession-Proof Stocks Haven't Always Protected
   Investors During Recessions and Bear Markets

   Many investors nowadays figure that as long as the economy
muddles through without a recession, stocks will do all
right.
   Even worrywarts can rest easy, as long as they load up on
stocks in such "recession-proof" industries as drugs, food,
tobacco and utilities, or so the conventional wisdom says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   History, however, has another story to tell: Not only do
bear markets often arrive without a recession -- and
recessions without bear markets -- but defensive stocks don't
always offer much protection when stocks do fall.
   A bear market is often defined as a market in which stock
prices fall 15% or more. Since 1960, investors have been
mauled by six of them. But only half of those bear markets
were recession-related, according to Ibbotson Associates
Inc., a Chicago investment-research firm.
   The most notable exception was the downdraft that
culminated in the 1987 stock-market crash, one of the worst
drops since the crash of 1929. From its peak in mid-August
1987 to its trough in October, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index plunged about 36%. (Even looking at full-month total
returns, including dividends, the drop exceeded 23%.) But
there wasn't any sign of negative economic growth, let alone
a recession. Ordinarily, the National Bureau of Economic
Research, the official scorekeeper on such matters, requires
at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth before
it calls a recession.
   This isn't to say that bear markets aren't important
economic signals. "In most of these cases {where no recession
materialized}, the market did accurately predict a growth
slowdown," said Anirvan Banerji, an economist at Columbia
University's Center for International Business Cycle
Research.
   The Columbia researchers, unlike the Commerce Department,
don't include the stock market in their index of leading
economic indicators because it is "too sensitive to the
economy," he said. In the cases where the market did
correctly foresee a recession, it was on average eight to 10
months early, according to Mr. Banerji.
   Stock prices also tend to anticipate economic recoveries
by four to six months. A look at the track record shows that
when a recession is mild, stock prices are often on the
rebound about the time the recession is getting under way.
But when a recession is long and severe, the market often
takes its most harrowing pratfall after the recession
arrives.
   The market's subtle knack for spotting economic shifts
stems from the fact that stock prices reflect future
expectations, not just current realities. In particular, the
market's performance is frequently linked closely to how
investors view the changing long-term outlook for corporate
profits and interest rates.
   That means, for instance, that when the economy is running
at full steam, straining capacity and reviving inflation,
investors are already looking ahead to higher interest rates
and softer company earnings. As investors rush to take their
bull-market gains, the market can sell off sharply even when
the anticipated downturn fails to register as a recession.
   Investor expectations also help explain why five out of 11
recessions that occurred since 1929 weren't accompanied by
bear markets. "Most of those {solo} recessions were extremely
mild" and occurred in periods, such as the '40s, '50s and
early '80s, when the economy was recovering from a very low
base, said Laurence Siegel, managing director at Ibbotson
Associates. The market was factoring in "not just the next
few months of recession but a long period of tremendous
anticipated growth in the future."
   Today, in contrast, the economy is sputtering at the end
of one of the longest economic booms in history, and a
growing number of investment professionals see high odds of a
bear market ahead, whether an "official" recession
materializes or not. They think the market isn't sufficiently
discounting some clear and present troubles on the corporate
profit front that justify an additional 10% drop in share
prices, even after the latest oil-induced slide.
   "The market is still complacent," said Carmine Grigoli,
chief equity portfolio strategist at First Boston Corp.
"There are certain characteristics that are not yet reflected
in stocks prices but should be."
   Among the biggest threats to corporate profits, and by
inference to stock prices, is debt, the pros say.
   Even before the Iraqi invasion sent oil prices soaring,
companies were "having trouble passing through costs," said
Mr. Grigoli. "Meanwhile, interest expense is already
absorbing a near record proportion of corporate cash flow."
This pincer movement "will make the earnings decline much
more pronounced than in past recessions" if the economy
weakens further, he said.
   Because of the unusual profit risks today, Mr. Grigoli
believes stock prices, on average, shouldn't be more than
13.5 times companies' per-share earnings. That's well below
the current "market multiple" of about 15 times earnings, but
not as bad as it could get, he said. "Multiples have hit an
average low of 10 times earnings in post-war recessions," he
said.
   Why isn't the market discounting these risks? One reason
is that expectations may still be too rosy after the go-go
experience of the 1980s, said John Hagler, of investment
advisers Hagler, Mastrovita &amp; Hewitt. "We've cranked into
stock prices great expectations with respect to future
corporate profitability and growth" that are based on the
leverage-driven performance of the last decade, he said.
   That performance is "probably unrepeatable," given the
current high level of corporate, government and consumer
debt, Mr. Hagler said. But before investors' expectations
drop to realistic levels, the market may go through "either a
short and painful correction or, as my suspicion is, a long
Chinese water torture lasting three or four years."
   Hilda Ochoa, president of Strategic Investment Management,
sees other reasons why stocks could be in for trouble now.
"The market is definitely more overvalued now than it was in
the {weak economy of the} late '70s and early '80s" by as
much as 20% to 30%, she said. And history shows that the more
overvalued stocks are, the "more vulnerable {they are to} the
slightest negative shock or change in evaluation of the
economy."
   And that's not all. "Shrinking liquidity arising from debt
problems and lower structural demand for stocks" also bode
ill for stocks, she said. For instance, corporate buyers have
less appetite for stocks now that the takeover boom is over;
most pension funds are fully funded and won't be adding much
to their portfolios; and foreign buyers aren't as likely to
venture into U.S. stocks at a time when they too are being
hurt by higher oil prices and rising interest rates, she
said.
   Under the circumstances, stock-market investors who think
they can play it safe may have some rude surprises coming.
Many classic "defensive" plays have backfired in recessions
and bear markets over the past 20 years, an analysis by
BARRA, a Berkeley, Calif., investment-research firm shows. As
the table accompanying this article shows, most stock groups
widely considered to be defensive caused investors big losses
when the market fell. Moreover, they often lost more than the
market as a whole.
   Despite what brokers may say about these blue-chip
bastions, the performance of these stocks has a lot less to
do with their "recession-proof" earnings than the multiple of
earnings that investors pay to buy them in the first place,
the pros say.
   "What's recession-proof about them?" asked Ibbotson's Mr.
Siegel. "By the time everybody wants them, they're probably
priced too far out of reach to offer good returns."

   The Voting Rights Act was passed in the 1960s to guarantee
the electoral participation of minorities and to strike down
discriminatory election laws. But since it was amended in
1982, it has often been used to promote a racial spoils
system. Districts that once discriminated against minorities
are now twisted to guarantee the election of liberals and to
exclude other minority voices. A federal appeals court has
now decided to study charges that the law is being perverted
into a means for backdoor political power.
   The case of Sarah Flores has brought the issue front and
center. Until this month, she was favored to win a fall
runoff election and become the first Hispanic to serve on the
powerful Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Then
federal Judge David Kenyon invalidated her primary victory on
the Catch-22 ground that the district lines had been
gerrymandered so that no Hispanic could win under them. Mrs.
Flores, a longtime Hispanic activist, protested. Last week
the federal appeals court delayed both her scheduled election
and the new election ordered by Judge Kenyon while it studies
the matter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The local ACLU chapter and other liberal groups that
charged the current district lines dilute Hispanic voting
power are more interested in politics than voting rights.
Otherwise, they would agree that Mrs. Flores, a lifetime
county employee who won 68% of the Hispanic vote in her
primary, is both qualified and has real Hispanic support. The
problem is that Mrs. Flores isn't their kind of Hispanic. She
is a Republican.
   To avoid a Flores victory and continued conservative
control of the Board of Supervisors, liberal activists
persuaded Judge Kenyon to cancel her election and adopt their
own gerrymandered district map. The poodle-shaped district
shown nearby packs in as many Hispanic Democrats as possible
while excluding Mrs. Flores's political base and, indeed, her
home (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Aug. 21, 1990).
Several hundred thousand residents of the old district would
be denied the right to vote for a supervisor for at least two
years.
   The appeals-court ruling is expected in October, but Mrs.
Flores has no better than an even chance of winning. That's
because Judge Kenyon's original ruling striking down the
existing districts was conveniently issued the day before
Mrs. Flores's first-place showing. That means the fact that
Mrs. Flores is one step away from winning can't easily be
made part of the judicial record.
   There is still a way to expose the political hypocrisy at
work in the Flores case. The court-ordered delay of the
election for supervisor means that Pete Schabarum, the
retiring incumbent, will serve until an election is held next
year. If he chooses to leave office on schedule, Governor
George Deukmejian would be free to appoint Sarah Flores to
take the seat she was favored to win anyway.
   The travesty of a court throwing one Hispanic out of
office on the grounds of discrimination so another Hispanic
can take her place would be lost on no one. Perhaps it would
even stir the Bush Justice Department to question its
apparent policy of supporting every Voting Rights Act lawsuit
liberal groups can dream up.

   Cheney Announces
   U.S. Presence
   In Abu Dhabi

   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates -- The U.S. has moved a
contingent of Air Force transport planes to this tiny kingdom
and has received pledges of military cooperation from Oman
and Qatar, illustrating America's newfound acceptance in
parts of the Arab world.
   A fleet of 16 C-130 aircraft and nearly 600 Air Force
personnel secretly were moved here a week ago from Little
Rock, Ark., to participate in the enormous airlift of troops
and war materiel into Saudi Arabia. The arrangement was
announced yesterday during a visit here by Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Its significance extends beyond speeding the movement of
cargo. The sudden and now publicly acknowledged presence of
U.S. forces in the United Arab Emirates, which had
consistently rebuffed such requests over the years,
demonstrates the sharp and perhaps long-lasting change in
America's role in the entire region following Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
   "It is a big step for the emirate" and "a number of
governments in the Gulf to invite United States forces in,"
Secretary Cheney told reporters after meeting at the
presidential palace with Sheik Zayid, ruler of the U.A.E.
   "They are deeply concerned that their very existence is
threatened by Saddam Hussein," Mr. Cheney said, and are
"eager to cooperate with the U.S." and other Arab governments
to ensure that the Iraqi president doesn't advance any
farther.
   Secretary Cheney is discussing possible arms sales with
several other countries in the region, and military officials
said Oman already is a busy transshipment point for the U.S.
military buildup in Saudi Arabia. In addition, Qatar has
agreed in principle to allow U.S. planes there during a
crisis.
   Mr. Cheney met with the rulers of Oman and Qatar during
his tour, before heading for sessions with Saudi Arabia's
King Fahd and other Saudi officials.
   Mr. Cheney's hectic flights crisscrossing the Middle East
illustrate his increasingly important diplomatic role to
isolate Iraq's Hussein, while the U.S. builds up its naval
forces and ground troops in Saudi Arabia.
   The United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman have all pledged
to send troops into Saudi Arabia, and their air bases and
harbors are important to keep supplies moving steadily. Use
of airports in the Persian Gulf countries also would provide
U.S. airmen emergency landing strips if shooting breaks out,
an official traveling with Mr. Cheney said.
   Mr. Cheney's comments reflected the sea change affecting
the region. Amid the splendor of Abu Dhabi's seaside palace,
decked with marble and an ornate rug as large as a tennis
court, the secretary emphasized that "our defensive efforts
of the past few weeks apply to all our friends in the Gulf."
He is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the U.A.E.
in its 18-year history.
   Later, standing in the 110-degree weather, Mr. Cheney
talked about the potential for longer-term military ties.
Countries in the region "are now prepared to actively engage
with us to enhance their security," including buying
"additional equipment if that's what they need," he told
reporters.
   For the airmen who work in a rickety hangar and sleep
packed together in makeshift air-conditioned trailers put up
by the U.A.E in 48 hours, short-term concerns are paramount.
"We slept in the hangar the first night, on the floor," said
Col. Richard Pluchinsky, a Vietnam veteran who now serves as
the unit's operations officer. "Right now we can sustain our
operation for 30 days" without receiving additional spare
parts or other materiel from the U.S.
   Despite the immense logistical problems, the colonel said
morale is pretty good. "The flyers want to fly. The
maintainers want to fix," he said.
   After looking over the primitive living conditions for
U.S. military personnel in Abu Dhabi, Mr. Cheney said the
American people must understand that "we are here because we
need to be here." The Bush administration, he said, is
committed "to stay as long as we're needed and as long as
we're wanted. That is what I have told to troops, too."

   Business Brief -- OMI Corp.:
   Public Securities Considered

   OMI Corp., an international bulk shipping company, said it
is considering whether to issue publicly traded securities
for its international joint venture activities.
   The company said a decision will not be reached before the
end of the year, because of the complexity of such a
transaction. Company officials couldn't be reached to
elaborate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts think New York-based OMI considers its stock
undervalued and hopes to get a greater value for its foreign
operations. "There are times when the parts are worth more
than the whole but it is not recognized by investors," says
Luella White-Price of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities.
   In 1989, OMI had revenue of $32.9 million from foreign
operations compared with $160 million for its domestic
activities. However, foreign operating profit was $21.3
million compared with $13.7 million for domestic shipping
operations. OMI's net income nearly doubled to $27.5 million,
or $1.01 a share, from $14.1 million, or 45 cents a share.
The year-earlier per-share figure included a 25-cent
reduction because of an accounting change on dry-dock
expenses.
   OMI maintains approximately a 50% interest in a number of
operations, including Rubicon Tankers Ltd. and Mosaic
Alliance Corp.
   OMI shares closed yesterday at $7, down 75 cents, in
American Stock Exchange composite trading.

   Beset by slow sales and steep losses, Data General Corp.
plans another big round of layoffs, company insiders said.
   The cutbacks could total at least 2,000, or 17% of Data
General's work force of 11,700, and are expected to be
announced in early September.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, Ronald L. Skates, president and chief
executive officer, denied industry speculation that he has
been seeking a buyer for the big minicomputer maker, based in
Westborough, Mass. "We aren't talking with anyone about
selling the company," he said in an interview.
   The layoffs would be the latest in a series at the
loss-plagued company, shrinking employment from a peak of
17,700 in 1985, its last profitable year. Revenue peaked at
$1.36 billion in 1988.
   A Data General spokesman yesterday wouldn't rule out
further cutbacks, and said, "We're going to take whatever
steps are necessary to become profitable," Mr. Skates added,
"We are doing everything we can to downsize the company."
   Data General is trying to transform itself from a
traditional minicomputer manufacturer to a maker of
workstations and computer network servers, built around
standard Unix operating software and low-cost,
standard-design microprocessors supplied by Motorola Inc.
   But the transition has taken longer than Data General
executives had hoped, as competition in the workstation
market has become more intense and sales of the company's
older minicomputer line eroded somewhat faster than expected.
The new workstation line, which is aggressively priced and
has received good technical reviews, is expected to bring in
sales of more than $100 million this year. Still, sales from
the older minicomputer line are likely to fall by more than
that sum, estimated Barry F. Willman, a Sanford C. Bernstein
&amp; Co. analyst.
   Analysts said Data General has a relatively strong balance
sheet, with only $58 million in long-term debt and $93
million in cash. But they said that further work-force
reductions are inevitable. "They've been losing money a lot
faster than they've been able to cut costs," Jay Stevens, an
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said.
   In the past, Motorola, a big communications equipment
maker based in Schaumburg, Ill., has been mentioned as a
potential suitor for Data General, because of the strategic
fit of the two companies' technology. But analysts discount
this possibility, noting that Motorola recently entered the
computer systems business on its own and may not want to
invest in Data General's headaches. A Motorola spokesman
declined to comment yesterday.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Data General shares closed near the 52-week low of $5,
finishing at $5.75, up 12.5 cents, giving the company an
indicated market value of $172.5 million. At the current
stock price, the company's value is less than 15% of annual
revenue, and well below its book value, or assets minus
liabilities, of $16 a share.
   For its third quarter ended June 30, Data General had a
net loss of $21.4 million, or 71 cents a share, on a 1.2%
decline in revenue to $302.4 million. The loss, though
narrower than the year-earlier third-quarter deficit of $23.1
million, or 79 cents a share, after a $6.3 million one-time
gain, was far larger than most analysts had expected. Data
General also backed off an earlier forecast that it would
break even or even show a profit in the fiscal fourth
quarter.

   First Interstate, Amid Continuing Woes,
   Suspends Dividend-Reinvestment Plan

   LOS ANGELES -- First Interstate Bancorp said it suspended
a dividend-reinvestment plan that had been a major element of
the struggling concern's efforts to rebuild its shattered
capital base.
   The move highlights the continuing woes of the nation's
eighth largest banking concern, despite recent rebounds from
disastrous results in the second half of 1989 that eroded
capital, hammered its stock price and made it vulnerable to a
takeover bid.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the plan, shareholders were allowed to use dividend
proceeds to buy First Interstate stock at a 2.5% discount
from market values. The plan had produced $260 million of
desperately needed capital since its initiation in February
1989.
   First Interstate said it dropped the plan because of its
flagging stock price. Although it earned $222.3 million, or
$3.60 a share, for the six months ended June 30, First
Interstate's stock has slid to new lows, making the issuance
of discounted shares under the reinvestment plan too
dilutive.
   "The purpose of the plan was to allow us to replenish our
capital base in a costeffective manner," said Edward M.
Carson, chairman and chief executive officer. "However, at
current stock price levels," it would not "serve the
interests of shareholders" to boost the number of shares
outstanding at cut-rate prices.
   The news drove First Interstate's stock down even further.
In New York Stock Exchange trading, it closed at $28.875,
down 50 cents. That was believed to be a record low for the
stock, which traded as high as $70 a share in the fall of
1989. Analysts say the swooning stock reflects both general
weakness in bank stocks and lingering skepticism about First
Interstate's prospects.
   The bank declined to comment on how the suspension of the
plan would affect its ongoing efforts to restore capital
devoured by surprise losses totaling $341.3 million in last
year's second half. A spokesman, noting that the bank has had
two profitable quarters in 1990, said the bank intends to
build capital through retained earnings. Meanwhile, the bank
is continuing restructuring efforts aimed at trimming its
cost structure, which remains one of banking's most bloated.
   Still, the stock's continuing plunge raised anew questions
about how long First Interstate will be able to avoid
becoming a takeover target. The current stock price level is
far below First Interstate's book value of $37.81 a share,
and has even gone below the $33 a share at which it sold 8.6
million shares in a public offering in February. Several
competitors, including Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Security Pacific
Corp. and BankAmerica Corp., are known to have studied
possible bids for First Interstate. As the stock price
slides, "the temptation for a bid rises," observed one
investment banker.
   Furthermore, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. bought 45% of
the shares sold in the February offering and owns about 10%
of First Interstate. Although KKR has said it supports
management's efforts to turn the company around, some other
institutional holders questioned how long KKR would tolerate
the low stock price. At present levels, KKR has a paper loss
of about $13 million on its purchases in the February
offering.
   "Losses have been known to make KKR's patience wear a
little thin," said one institutional holder.

   LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co. said it will
maintain its freeze on gasoline prices, but it is raising the
price of diesel and jet fuel.
   The decision to continue Arco's gasoline price freeze,
begun 13 days ago in the wake of President Bush's request
that oil companies act responsibly in pricing, is being
reviewed on a day-to-day basis, said George H. Babikian,
president of Arco Products Co., the company's marketing and
refining division.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Arco said the price of diesel fuel will
climb, on average, to 76 cents a gallon from 70 cents. Jet
fuel will increase to about 75 cents or 80 cents a gallon
from 70 cents, depending on specific contract arrangements
with customers.
   "Arco is doing all it can to hold the line, but we cannot
continue the freeze on diesel and jet fuel prices in the face
of sharp differences in marketplace prices between Arco and
its competitors," Mr. Babikian said in a statement. "In
addition, we have been forced to augment our jet fuel
supplies by buying on the spot market at high prices."
   Meanwhile, at an average of about $1.16 a gallon in Los
Angeles, Arco's regular unleaded gasoline is priced between
five and 13 cents below the competition, the spokesman said.
Accordingly, more than 100 Arco stations a day are running
out of regular unleaded gasoline at some of their pumps.
   Arco said it will continue "to encourage its dealers to
show restraint in setting prices." The company added that it
also is urging motorists to reduce gasoline consumption
during "the current emergency."

   Jacor Communications Inc. said it reached a debt
restructuring accord with its bank lenders but still faces an
Oct. 15 deadline to raise $15 million in fresh equity.
   Under terms of the new accord, Jacor has met all
previously extended interest payments, the company said. In
addition, Jacor, which owns 13 radio stations in eight cities
as well as other media properties, said it reduced the
principal of its bank credit outstanding by $3.5 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As part of the new lending accord, Jacor noted that its
banks extended to Oct. 15 or later their waiver of a
provision requiring the company to raise $15 million in fresh
equity. Jacor does not expect to meet the Oct. 15 deadline
and said it is seeking a further extension. It noted,
however, that "there can be no assurance that a further
extension will be granted."
   Moreover, the Cincinnati-based company noted that as a
condition of the agreement, Jacor agreed to continue to defer
indefinitely certain payments on subordinated indebtedness
and warrants and cash dividends on its capital stock. Jacor
said it has not yet obtained from the holders of these
obligations a consent to such deferral. Failure to obtain
consent will result in a default.

   Heard on the Street:
   USX, Unlike Most Oil-Related Companies,
   Hasn't Benefited From Persian Gulf Conflict

   PITTSBURGH -- In the nearly three weeks since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, just about everything associated with the
oil business has shot up in price. Everything, that is,
except USX stock.
   The nation's largest steelmaker, USX is also a major oil
company, through its Marathon Oil Co. unit. And Marathon
generated 55% of USX's pretax operating profit in 1989, up
from 36% in 1988. So USX stock might seem likely to be a big
beneficiary of the Persian Gulf hostilities. The crisis has
sent crude oil prices soaring 40%, to more than $28 a barrel,
as gasoline prices have ratcheted upward.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yet USX hasn't been caught up in Wall Street's newfound
fervor for oil stocks. The major oil stocks in the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index are up nearly 11% from the start of July,
bucking an 8% market decline. USX shares have barely budged
in the period. And at yesterday's close of 33 1/8, USX is
actually down 3% from the day before Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   The stock is dropping in part because investors worry
about the impact of a weak economy on the steel industry,
itself a big energy consumer. Steel is used in a lot of
recession-vulnerable products, notably autos and appliances.
If a recession develops, steel companies probably won't be
able to make recent price increases stick. Even more
troubling to investors is the possibility of a steel labor
strike; the USX contract has less than a half year to run.
   USX itself seems bewildered by the stock's behavior. Rex
Cooley, senior vice president and comptroller of USX, notes
that a $1-a-barrel rise in crude oil translates into $70
million pretax profit on an annualized basis for USX's oil
exploration and production segment. With crude oil up more
than $8 a barrel, the company's net income could be boosted
by roughly $305 million, or $1.20 a share annually.
   In the analysts' camp, George Gaspar of R.W. Baird has
raised his 1990 profit estimate for USX to $3.25 a share from
$2.75. Besides benefiting from higher prices for crude, he
says, Marathon should be able to increase production 3% to 5%
in the second half. Marathon had strong operating earnings in
the first half, posting an 11.8% rise from a year earlier to
a record level.
   Yet most analysts aren't changing their opinions of the
stock. Independent analyst Charles Bradford maintains a
neutral rating, saying the oil crisis hasn't allayed concerns
that Carl Icahn may dump his 13.3% stake in USX.
   A gloating Carl Icahn says the stock is being penalized by
the USX's role as the nation's No. 1 steelmaker. "People who
like oil don't buy it and people who like steel don't buy
it," he says. "It's neither fish nor fowl. Furthermore,
Marathon's future as a domestic oil producer hinges on
capital investment, which now must be shared with a
capital-consuming steel business, he says.
   In May, Mr. Icahn lost a proxy battle in which he sought
shareholder support for a spinoff of at least 80% of the
steel business. If USX had spun off steel, he insists now,
the stock would be "significantly higher." USX declined to
comment on his remarks.
   Robin Shoemaker at Shearson Lehman says a separate
Marathon Oil would trade at between $30 and $33 a share, with
steel trading at perhaps $8. The analyst says the stock's
weakness "puts more pressure on management to take some
action to separate Marathon from steel." USX has said that it
would consider reducing its exposure to steel through a
complete or partial sale, more joint ventures or an initial
public offering of as much as 20% of the steel operation. But
Chairman Charles A. Corry indicated earlier this month that
the company had nothing major in the works.
   Bryan Jacoboski, an oil analyst with PaineWebber, says
that even though a stand-alone oil company would be valued at
more after the invasion, a stand-alone steel company would be
less. Overall, "I don't know if they necessarily would be
better off," he says.
   As for USX, he thinks the poor performance reflects
several factors, including the presence of Mr. Icahn. "People
are afraid he's going to cut a deal for himself," the analyst
says. He also thinks investors were disappointed that the
company could sell only 30% of its Texas Oil &amp; Gas
exploration and production properties.
   Meanwhile, steel analysts say investors are worried about
approaching talks with the United Steelworkers union, whose
contract expires in January. During 1986 contract
negotiations, USX weathered a protracted strike.
   "The perception is that it might be difficult to
renegotiate that contract," says Leo Larkin, who follows
steel for Standard &amp; Poor's. "And that prevents USX stock
from benefiting from the rise in oil prices."

   Deficit to Swell by Billions
   As the Economy Slows,
   Military Outlays Grow

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The crisis in the Middle East has already
started to boost official estimates of the U.S. budget
deficit.
   The White House budget office and the Congressional Budget
Office said they increased their estimates of the budget
deficit for fiscal 1991 by about $1 billion as a result of
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. That increase reflects
government-guaranteed farm loans and export loans to Iraq now
unlikely to be repaid.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And that's just a small beginning. The figures don't show
it, but government officials say that the increase in defense
spending and the slowdown in the economy that result from the
Mideast crisis will add tens of billions of dollars to the
budget deficit next year. The result, barring new
deficit-cutting measures, will almost certainly be the
largest budget deficit in U.S. history, between $250 billion
and $300 billion.
   President Bush met with his staff on the budget in
Washington to complete work on a Republican proposal for
cutting the deficit. White House Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said: "We will have a significant package to put on the
table" when negotiations with Congress resume after Labor
Day.
   The new White House budget estimates, which exclude any
effects on the economy from the Middle East crisis but
include costs of the savings and loan bailout, put next
year's deficit at $232.3 billion.
   Yesterday's White House report, required by the
Gramm-Rudman budget law, shows that following that law's
strict formula, which excludes much of the S&amp;L spending, the
deficit for next year is estimated at $149.4 billion. That
means the government must cut the deficit by $85.4 billion to
meet the Gramm-Rudman law's target of $64 billion for fiscal
1991.
   If Congress and the White House fail to agree on a budget
plan in September, the Gramm-Rudman law's automatic spending
cuts will take hold Oct. 1, when the fiscal year begins. The
White House report said those cuts would slash many domestic
spending programs at least 32.4% and cut defense programs --
excluding military payrolls -- by a sharp 35.3%.
   The spending cuts are so Draconian, and their effects on
the government so severe, that most government officials say
Congress and the White House are virtually certain to prevent
them from taking place. Although the cuts are automatic,
Congress and the president can cancel them with a simple
piece of legislation.
   The White House budget office estimates are based on an
economic forecast that was prepared before Iraq invaded
Kuwait. Since that time, a sharp rise in oil prices has led
administration officials to acknowledge that economic growth
is likely to slow substantially. Internal administration
estimates suggest a $10 increase in the price of a barrel of
oil will cut growth by roughly 1.2 percentage points. That,
in turn, could add a further $25 billion to $30 billion to
the budget deficit. Higher interest rates could make that
deficit boost even larger.
   In addition, the massive deployment of U.S. troops to the
Middle East is likely to put upward pressure on defense
spending. President Bush said yesterday "we cannot attack the
deficit by attacking the very heart of our armed forces,
committed men and women who are motivated and ready."
   Mr. Bush said he will "oppose the defense budget slashers
who are out of tune with what America needs to keep freedom
secure and safe." And he criticized the House Armed Services
Committee for suggesting "unacceptable cuts from our defense
budget for fiscal year 1991."
   Later in the day the president told reporters that all
Pentagon cuts aren't off the table, just "reckless Pentagon
cuts are -- we just can't tolerate them. And I think that
most members of Congress will return and understand this
now."
   President Bush continues to push for a broad
deficit-cutting accord, and he plans to meet with
congressional leaders at Andrews Air Force Base in the first
week of September. The White House goal is to cut roughly $50
billion from the deficit in fiscal 1991, and $500 billion
over five years.
   But in the wake of the Mideast crisis, some members of
Congress say the chances for a budget deal have faded. With
the odds of recession rising, politicians worry that
deficit-cuts could push the economy over the brink. One
possible compromise discussed by some administration
officials would be to cut significantly less than $50 billion
in the first year, but still try to make close to $500
billion in cuts over five years.
   The Congressional Budget Office report calculated next
fiscal year's deficit by Gramm-Rudman rules at an even-larger
$165.2 billion, requiring cuts of $101.2 billion to reach the
Gramm-Rudman target. But while the congressional report is
required by the Gramm-Rudman law, it has no effect in
calculating the automatic spending cuts.
   Like the White House, the Congressional Budget Office said
that including savings and loan spending, next year's deficit
is estimated to exceed $230 billion. The largest budget
deficit in the past was in 1986, when it reached $221.2
billion.

small coastal freighters that he says stay in Egypt's
territorial waters and may try to work their way into the
Jordanian port of Aqaba, a potentially large hole in the
international interdiction net against Iraq. U.S. ships
closer to Aqaba and other ports have the final responsibility
of determining whether Iraqi cargo is involved, and the U.S.
would intercept ships only in international waters.
   But as tensions heat up in the Middle East, Capt. Foote
and his crew know they will find it even more difficult to
control shipments to Iraq and protect the U.S. fleet in the
Red Sea. "There have been a few cases where we hailed a ship
and got no response," Lt. Cmdr. Steve Miller, the
Ticonderoga's executive officer, said a few days ago. "But
you don't know if it's a {radio} frequency problem or
something much more serious."
   The volatility became clear over the weekend, when
American warships fired warning shots at two Iraqi vessels
believed to be carrying outbound cargoes of oil.
   "When we start getting into the business of firing warning
shots, you're never sure of the reaction," Capt. Foote told
reporters.
   In many ways, life aboard "The Tico" -- as the crew
affectionately calls this 10,000-ton cruiser -- reveals the
risks and difficulties of the Navy's massive show of force.
The Ticonderoga's sophisticated radars, which can
simultaneously track large numbers of ships and planes for
more than 250 miles, also serve as the primary air-defense
warning for the carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and its
support ships.
   "I'm ready at a moment's notice to fire a warning shot if
I have to," Capt. Foote told reporters who visited his ship
last weekend. If a hostile plane heads directly for the
Ticonderoga, he said, "I could have guns shooting in 10
seconds . . . and have missiles shooting in less than that."
   "The crew understand this is serious business, and they
know the president isn't joking," Capt. Foote said. "They all
have cars. They have motorcycles. I don't think any of them
fail to see the importance of fuel."
   All crew members have been issued gas masks and protective
clothing in the event chemical weapons are used by the
Iraqis.
   Inside the hushed, air-conditioned core of the ship --
called the combat information center -- the pale green light
from computer consoles and a giant, computer-generated map of
the region reflects off Capt. Foote's face. He presses a
button, and the image pans out to show the precise speed and
location of distant ships that won't reach the carrier task
force for days. Little half-moons identify the position of 50
or so planes that the ship's computers monitor every hour.
   In the blinding sunlight on deck, a few nervous sailors
with flak jackets, M-14 rifles slung over their shoulders and
.45-caliber pistols on their hips stand ready to make good on
the U.S. blockade. "We just call ourselves the
visit-and-search party," said the 27-year-old lieutenant in
charge. (Defense Department rules allow identifying only
senior officers.)
   If a ship is suspected of carrying Iraqi goods, these
sailors would take a small boat to board it and inspect the
cargo. "Every ship in the fleet has been asked to put
together such teams," said the native of Owings Mills, Md.
Ship captains are required to consult closely with senior
officers before taking such hostile action.
   Most of all, Capt. Foote worries about the long-term
impact on his crew's nerves. "It's very hard to be on
five-minute alert for six months," he said.

   HARLEYSVILLE, Pa. -- Harleysville Group Inc. and its
parent company, Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co., announced
an agreement to acquire the property and casualty insurance
operations of USLICO Corp., for $135 million in cash and
securities.
   Under the agreement, Harleysville Group and Harleysville
Mutual will purchase all of the capital stock issued and
outstanding of Hawkeye Insurance, based in Des Moines, Iowa,
and its consolidated subsidiaries: United Security Insurance
Co., also based in Des Moines, and Western States Insurance
Co., based in Freeport, Ill.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The transaction price of $135 million will consist of a
cash payment of $110 million, of which $93 million will be
contributed by Harleysville Group, which is a publicly traded
company. Harleysville Mutual will contribute $17 million and
will issue a $25 million, seven-year, 10% note to USLICO.
Immediately prior to the closing of the deal, Hawkeye will
return to USLICO 500,000 common shares of USLICO.
   Bradford W. Mitchell, chairman and chief executive officer
of Harleysville Group, said that the acquisition may have a
moderately dilutive effect on the company's per-share
earnings next year and in 1992, but that it "will have an
anti-dilutive effect on our earnings after that time."
   Mr. Mitchell said the acquisition of USLICO's
property-casualty business will help Harleysville continue
its strategic plan to build its national network of regional
insurance companies. The acquisition will give Harleysville,
which now operates four regional property-casualty insurers
that cover the East Coast, a new presence in Midwest and
Western states. The company will have operations in 34
states, up from 19.
   In a separate but related transaction, Harleysville Mutual
will sell its wholly owned subsidiary, Harleysville Life
Insurance Co., to USLICO for a $17 million, seven-year, 10%
note that Harleysville will hold in its investment portfolio.

   HOUSTON -- Baroid Corp., controlled by Dallas financier
Harold Simmons, said its board approved a previously
announced plan to separate its petroleum services businesses
and metals and mining businesses into two publicly traded
companies in a tax-free spinoff.
   Under the restructuring, the company said it will
distribute to current shareholders all shares of common stock
in its subsidiary, New Baroid Corp., which includes its
petroleum services businesses. Shareholders will receive one
share of New Baroid Corp. common for each share of the
company's common stock held on a record date to be
established. The company will then adopt a new name and New
Baroid Corp. will change its name to Baroid Corp., the
company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Baroid also said that after the restructuring its
operations will consist primarily of Titanium Metals Corp.,
its titanium metals business, and its bentonite mining
business.
   Robert J. Leidich, Baroid's vice president and general
counsel, said the company is undertaking the spinoff to
"separate two distinct lines of businesses."
   The company said the plan is subject to several
conditions, including New Baroid's ability to complete
negotiations with a group of commercial banks for a $200
million credit facility. New Baroid plans to distribute $100
million of the proceeds of the credit facility to the company
prior to the stock distribution and will use about $50
million of the remaining proceeds to repay debts.
   The plan, which isn't subject to approval by shareholders,
is expected to be completed by early October, the company
said.
   Baroid itself was created in 1988 when it was spun off
from NL Industries, also controlled by Mr. Simmons through
his Valhi Inc. holding company.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Baroid
closed at $14.25, down 37.5 cents.

   NEW YORK -- Paramount Communications Inc. said Michael S.
Hope, an executive vice president, will leave the company at
fiscal year end on Oct. 31 to pursue other opportunities.
   Mr. Hope, 48 years old and one of two executive vice
presidents at Paramount, oversees planning and operations,
and played a large role in restructuring the company from a
conglomerate into a trimmer concern focused on entertainment
and publishing. He said he made "a personal decision" to
leave, now that the restructuring is complete.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some analysts said Mr. Hope also may have seen little
opportunity for advancement at Paramount, a highly
decentralized company run by Martin S. Davis, chairman and
chief executive officer, who doesn't have a clear No. 2
executive.
   Formerly a partner at the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young,
Mr. Hope joined Paramount in 1983 as chief financial officer
and was named to his current post four years later. His
duties will be assumed by Paramount's chief financial
officer, Ronald L. Nelson, 38.

   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Donald J. Trump reached a
compromise with about 60 subcontractors who are owed about
$70 million for their work on the Taj Mahal casino here.
   A pact was signed by Mr. Trump and the subcontractors just
in time for the New Jersey Casino Control Commission to rule
on Mr. Trump's $65 million bank bailout today without the
threat of an immediate default judgment against Mr. Trump
hanging over the proceedings. The contractors, many of whom
said they had employed extra personnel to help Mr. Trump open
the Taj by April 2, 1990, had threatened to force Mr. Trump
to seek bankruptcy-law protection if they weren't paid. Mr.
Trump hasn't paid them because the casino hasn't generated as
much cash as expected.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Terms of the deal are believed to include a deferral of
almost all the claims against Mr. Trump for at least a week.
After that, the contractors are scheduled to get about 20
cents on the dollar, or about $14 million, with future
payments deferred, said one person familiar with the terms of
the agreement. It isn't clear where Mr. Trump will get the
cash to make the payments or whether he can use any of the
expected $65 million bank loan for that purpose.

   Building Contracts
   Begin to Stabilize

   NEW YORK -- National construction contracting activity
seems to be stabilizing after a steep decline early this
year.
   In the latest revision of its 1990 outlook, F.W. Dodge,
McGraw-Hill Inc.'s forecasting unit, projected a 7% decline
in construction contracting this year to $247.08 billion from
1989's record $266.97 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The worst seems to be over for the building market
nationally," said George A. Christie, vice president and
chief economist at Dodge. Still, Mr. Christie warned that
while reduced construction because of the savings and loan
crisis had already occurred, replacing S&amp;Ls as a source of
construction loans will be a "time-consuming process."
   The survey said it expects non-residential building
contracts to decline 10% this year, to $85.6 billion,
including a 17% decline in commercial and manufacturing
buildings, a 7% gain in educational building contracts, and a
1% decline in hospital and health construction. Office
building contracts are expected to decline 23%.
   Funding for nonbuilding construction is expected to ease
2%, to $47.7 billion, with transportation contracts flat and
environmental public works down 1%. Utility construction is
expected to fall 15%.
   Residential construction, forecast at $113.8 billion, is
expected to fall 7%, with a 3% decline in single-family
houses and a 20% decline in multifamily housing.

   Of Weapons-Test Case

<LP>
   LOS ANGELES -- A previously sealed court document
indicates that the Justice Department decided not to pursue
at least 11 areas being looked at by criminal investigators
as part of a settlement agreement it signed last February
with Northrop Corp.
   As part of the deal, Northrop pleaded guilty to 34 counts
of falsifying test results on the air-launched cruise missile
and the Harrier jet. It also paid the government $17 million,
one of the largest penalties ever extracted from a defense
contractor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the dropping of the criminal inquiries has miffed some
parties close to the matter, who contend that the government
gave away too much for too little. "We are extremely
disappointed," said Phil Benson, an attorney in the law
offices of Herbert Hafif. The firm, based in Claremont,
Calif., represents a number of employee whistle-blowers who
raised many of the allegations against Northrop.
   It has been known for months that a number of criminal
investigations, including probes into some aspects of the
manufacturing of MX missile parts and the B-2 Stealth bomber,
had been terminated as a result of the settlement pact. But
the precise list of what federal prosecutors no longer were
pursuing was sealed, and the government sought to keep the
exhibit containing that information under wraps. The Los
Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal moved to have the
document released, however, and it was finally made part of
the court file yesterday.
   Mr. Benson said he was particularly irked that criminal
investigations into two matters weren't being continued. One
involves allegations that Northrop circumvented normal supply
channels and installed components from neighborhood stores
like Radio Shack into MX-missile guidance units. The other
involves contentions that the company wrongfully charged the
Air Force for equipment, known as the dry integrated test
system.
   "The $17 million doesn't come close to compensating the
taxpayers for what the government gave away in this
settlement," Mr. Benson asserted. "The fate of these cases
were never allowed to be determined by a jury. They were
determined behind closed doors."
   Northop has denied all wrongdoing.
   William Fahey, the assistant U.S. attorney here who
negotiated the settlement, wasn't immediately available
yesterday. But Mark Richard, a senior Justice Department
official, testified before Congress last month that it was
decided to cease some investigations into Northrop only after
lengthy scrutiny.
   In some cases, he said, it was determined that the statute
of limitations had expired. In others, experienced agents and
prosecutors had determined there was "insufficient evidence
of criminal fraud."
   Northrop still remains the focus of two ongoing criminal
probes by the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, according to
Justice Department documents. But the portion of the exhibit
that spells out exactly which cases were being pursued by
that office as of February was redacted from the record by
the court.
   In a March filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Northrop itself disclosed that its work on a
flight-control mechanism on the B-2, known as the ARTs
system, was being examined. The company also said it was
being looked at with regard to two other, unidentified
investigations. Mr. Benson said he thought one of the cases
may be a probe into Northrop's receipt of payments for
building the ZSR-62, an avionics system on the B-2. The third
case may have had to do with tubing used on the Navy's F/A-18
fighter jet. But one of Northrop's outside attorneys received
a letter dated July 9 from the U.S. Attorney's office here
saying the company isn't currently "either a subject or a
target" of that probe.
   Justice Department officials are quick to note that they
are also pressing to have Northrop sanctioned
administratively. And the department is also pursuing some
civil allegations. In certain cases, in fact, the government
is acting as co-plaintiff with Mr. Hafif's clients, who stand
to receive a portion of any monies recovered from Northrop.
Mr. Benson said that it is much harder to litigate a civil
case against the company, however, when there is no
collateral criminal investigation to help ferret out
evidence.
   Even with the unsealing of the exhibit, it remains
somewhat fuzzy exactly which investigations have been
dropped. For instance, one part of the document says the
government won't pursue any allegations related to "the
`final report' matter at Northrop's B-2 division." Mr. Benson
said he didn't know what that referred to.
   The exhibit also says that the government won't pursue
criminally any "allegations of improprieties and/or
illegalities" set forth in any of the whistle-blower cases
pending in U.S. District Court here. Mr. Benson said he
feared that language was overly sweeping.
   The House Government Operations Committee is expected to
conduct a hearing in September that may explore further the
terms and circumstances of the settlement. The panel also
plans to raise questions about whether the cruise missile
will malfunction at low temperatures it is supposed to be
able to withstand. Also as part of the agreement in February,
the Justice Department dropped charges related to the
low-temperature issue, largely because the Air Force loosened
testing requirements, making a fraud case tough to prove.

   LOS ANGELES -- A federal court judge sentenced David
Arnold Feldman to 15 years in prison and ordered him to pay
restitution of $70.7 million to BankAmerica Corp., the
biggest loser in a $144 million mortgage investment scheme.
   Mr. Feldman, 50 years old, was convicted June 9 of three
counts of mail fraud and was acquitted of two other counts.
Five counts were dismissed during the trial for failure of
proof. Mr. Feldman was taken into custody yesterday after the
sentencing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "A notice of appeal of the conviction and the sentence
will be filed" today, said Rodney Perlman, a Los Angeles
attorney representing Mr. Feldman. Judge Dickran Tevrizian
"exceeded his authority" in making the restitution order, the
attorney asserted.
   Two other principal figures in the mortgage fraud pleaded
guilty earlier this year to reduced charges of mail fraud.
They are Kent Borden Rogers, 50, of Huntington Beach, Calif.,
and George Charles Ash Jr., 45, of Alta Loma, Calif. The
three men were indicted last year for scheming to sell what
proved to be practically worthless mortgage loans to 20 banks
and savings and loan associations.
   The men promised high interest rates and assured investors
that their investments were protected by independent
underwriting policies, among other safeguards. Most of the
loans later went into default, and Bank of America, as the
trustee for most of the mortgage securities pools,
repurchased them and took $95 million in charges against the
1984 earnings of its parent, BankAmerica Corp.

   WASHINGTON -- Seven major toy distributors were sued by
the Justice Department and the Consumer Product Safety
Commission for selling imported toys the government
considered hazardous.
   The suits are the result of a yearlong investigation
conducted by the commission and the U.S. Customs Service that
found the companies sold imported toys that failed to meet
federal health and safety standards. The items included
rattles and other toys with small parts that could pose a
choking risk to small children, as well as toys coated with
lead-based paint.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although most of the product labels recommended the toys
for children over three years of age, commission officials
said the design of the toys proved they were actually
intended for younger children. The commission said there were
no known injuries or deaths resulting from the toys, which
were imported mostly from Taiwan.
   The chief executives of the companies also were named in
the suits.
   The suits seek injunctions against the companies to stop
the sale of the items. A commission spokesman said the action
also is designed to encourage U.S. companies to require the
same quality-control standards of foreign products as they do
of U.S.-produced goods.
   The companies named in the suits are Toys "R" Us, Paramus,
N.J.; Child World Inc., Avon, Mass.; Lionel Leisure Inc.,
Philadelphia; Value Merchants Inc., Milwaukee; Illco Toy Co.
U.S.A., New York; Beachcombers International Inc., Fort
Myers, Fla.; Division Sales Inc. and an affiliated
partnership, Justen Products, both of Itasca, Ill.
   Michael Goldstein, vice chairman of Toys "R" Us, said the
suit "is without merit. Our safety record is excellent."
   Mr. Goldstein said he did not know which specific toys
were mentioned in the suit and he declined to speculate as to
why the suit was being brought at this time. He called the
suit a "waste of taxpayers' money," but added that he was
confident the company would prevail.
   The other companies couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.
   Over the past year, several companies have agreed to
voluntarily recall certain products.

   Banks Fare Poorly in Their Attempts
   To Parcel Out Parts of Big RJR Loan

   NEW YORK -- Regional and foreign banks are balking at
taking on a large portion of last month's $2.25 billion loan
to RJR Nabisco Inc. unless they get a bigger cut of the fat
fees offered to the banks that originated the loan.
   About two dozen banks lent money to RJR in July as part of
a wide refinancing plan for the tobacco and food company. The
loan -- which offered banks unusually high up-front fees for
participating -- was oversubscribed by more than three to
one.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As is typical with such large financings, the lead banks
are trying to parcel out much of the loan to a wider group of
banks. Such syndications help the original lending banks
avoid undue concentration in lending to a single borrower.
Syndications also let smaller banks widen their loan
portfolios.
   So far, however, the RJR loan syndication hasn't proved
popular. The American Banker yesterday reported that RJR's
main lending banks have pooled together to offer $1.4 billion
of the RJR loan for resale, but attracted bids for only $200
million of the loan as of last Friday. The pooled syndication
is due to expire Aug. 31. "I suspect the {main} banks will
come up short and perhaps far short of what they want to
sell," said one banker who has lent to RJR.
   The main sticking point, bankers said, is how to divide up
the fees that RJR paid last month to get the loan done. The
fees that RJR's main banks collected ranged from 2.75% of
their loan amount to as much as 8% in a few cases. The loan
was led by units of Bankers Trust New York Corp., Chase
Manhattan Corp., Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, Fuji Bank
Ltd., Security Pacific Corp., Citicorp and Manufacturers
Hanover Corp.
   New banks buying into the loan are currently being offered
fees as low as 0.5% if they buy a $10 million piece of the
loan, or 1% if they buy $35 million or more, bankers said.
That has struck some banks as too puny to attract their
interest. "People knew what the main banks got paid," one
banker said. "There's a feeling that if the loan is going to
be sold down, the main banks can afford to share a lot of the
fees."
   Starting next month, several bankers said, they expect
that more of the latest RJR loan will be sold to a wide group
of banks, with greater fee-sharing than is currently being
offered. Several of RJR's agent banks insisted, however, that
they aren't in any rush to sell their RJR loans and are
simply testing the market with the current pooled offer.
   The current tussle over the RJR loan syndication doesn't
matter to the tobacco and food company itself; it already has
collected its $2.25 billion. The struggle also is unlikely to
leave any one bank hugely exposed to RJR; the largest single
bank loan to the company in this round of lending was about
$110 million.
   Nevertheless, bankers said, the current impasse shows that
the mania for leveraged lending has calmed down considerably
from the late 1980s, when banks such as Citicorp and Bankers
Trust often were able to sell off 90% or more of their loans
to highly leveraged companies, and still keep millions of
dollars of fee income on their books.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Three Pilots Found Guilty of Flying Drunk

   A federal jury in Mineapolis found three former Northwest
Airlines pilots guilty of flying while under the influence of
alcohol.
   The trial is apparently the first prosecution under a 1986
federal law that prohibited substance abuse by
commercial-transport employees. The three men -- Norman Lyle
Prouse, Robert Kirchner and Joseph Balzer -- each face a
maximum penalty of 15 years in jail and a $250,000 fine.
Sentencing is expected next month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The three pilots didn't contest that they had consumed
numerous drinks at a North Dakota bar several hours before
they flew a jetliner with 91 passengers to Minneapolis.
Federal officials, acting on a tip from a bar patron,
arrested the three at the end of the March 8 flight.
   Northwest Airlines, a subsidiary of NWA Inc., fired the
three men for violating a company rule that prohibits
ingesting alcohol within 12 hours of a flight.
   In his instructions to jurors last week, U.S. District
Judge James Rosenbaum said that any impairment, however
slight, would constitute a violation under the federal
statute. If they found no impairment, however, the jury was
free to find the pilots not guilty -- despite the blood
tests, taken at the end of the flight, which showed alcohol
levels ranging from 0.06% to 0.13%.
   The pilots argued at trial that they weren't impaired, and
cited the perfect flight as proof. One pilot, Mr. Prouse, had
contended that because he had a long history of alcoholism,
he was inured to a greater extent than most people to the
effects of alcohol.
   An attorney for Mr. Prouse said there was "virtually no
evidence that any of {the pilots'} actions in operating the
flight were impaired," as the judge's instructions required
the government to prove. An appeal of the conviction is
likely, he said, on a number of issues, including the
validity of the citizen's arrest made by a Federal Aviation
Administration official. Attorneys for the other two
defendants couldn't be reached for comment.
   In their arguments, neither the prosecutor nor the
attorneys for the defendants mentioned to the jury a clause
in the federal law that says pilots are presumed to be
impaired when their blood-alcohol level is above 0.10%. That
would have apparently nearly guaranteed at least one
conviction. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth de la Vega,
who prosecuted the case, said in an interview that she wasn't
convinced that portion of the statute could withstand a
constitutional challenge.
   In the end, the presumption clause wasn't needed, she
said, because of scientific experts' testimony about the
effect of alcohol on performance. "In a way, science was on
trial," Ms. de la Vega said.

   MANVILLE TRUST hires a public relations firm.
   Amid mounting criticism of its huge cash shortage, the
Manville asbestos personal-injury trust recently hired a
public-relations firm, Robinson, Lake, Lerer &amp; Montgomery, to
help improve its public image.
   Robinson Lake, which represents Michael Milken and other
well-known clients, is working for the trust on a $10,000
monthly retainer with a $15,000 cap on total monthly
spending. Since early June, the firm's work for the trust has
cost about $30,000, said Marianna S. Smith, the trust's
executive director.
   Ms. Smith said the trust decided to hire the firm to help
respond to negative publicity about the trust's cash
shortage. After the trust announced earlier this year that it
was unable to pay current asbestos personal-injury claimants
for more than 20 years, it came under harsh criticism in the
courts for failing to come up with adequate financing.
Although the trust had expected to temporarily have
insufficient cash to pay claims, the shortage came much
sooner and was much worse than expected. It is estimated that
the cash shortage will be $30 million by March 31, 1991.
   The assets of the trust, formed as part of Manville
Corp.'s 1986 bankruptcy-court reorganization, consist mainly
of Manville stock, which went down in price as the trust came
under criticism.
   "When the bad publicity came out, what we saw was that our
asset base was being negatively affected," Ms. Smith said.
She said the trust hired Robinson Lake for advice in
improving the trust's image and preserving the value of the
assets.
   But some plaintiffs' attorneys reacted with surprise and
disappointment at the hiring of outside public-relations
counsel.
   "At a time when everyone is worried about the trust
running out of money and whether victims will be left without
compensation, for the trust to spend $120,000 a year on PR
seems to be an improper use of the funds," said Stanley Levy,
one of the major attorneys for asbestos victims and a
director of Manville Corp. The trust is independent of the
company.
   U.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein, the federal judge in
Brooklyn who has authority over all matters arising out of
the Manville bankruptcy case, has ordered the trust to
restructure its financing by Sept. 6. The judge has said that
operating expenses at the trust can be trimmed substantially.
   The hiring of Robinson Lake was brought to Judge
Weinstein's attention yesterday, according to one of the
judge's law clerks. A few weeks ago the judge issued a
freeze, which has been extended to Sept. 6, on the trust's
payment of settlements. The freeze allows the trust to
continue making "necessary" payments to staff and operating
expenses, but it is unclear whether it applies to paying an
outside public-relations firm.
   In defending the trust's retention of Robinson Lake, Ms.
Smith compared the cost to the amount the trust pays in its
average asbestos settlement, $43,231. Although the retainer
is $10,000 a month, she says the trust expects to pay less
than that amount monthly.
   Ms. Smith also said the trust might not require the firm's
services for very long. Robinson Lake's Washington office is
working for the trust on a month-to-month basis. Robinson
Lake declined to comment.
   Donald M. Blinken, a trustee of the trust, said Robinson
Lake was hired because "we had been very low-key. It was time
for the trust to explain what it has been doing and why."
   A spokeswoman for the trust said Robinson Lake is mainly
providing behind-the-scenes advice in dealing with the press.
The firm will not be dealing directly with the news media,
nor will it advise the trust on legal strategy and financing,
she said.
   She said the trust wants Robinson Lake's help in improving
its public image so that asbestos claimants will "have
confidence that we're acting for them." Most asbestos victims
are former construction workers and shipbuilders who were
exposed to asbestos on the job years ago. Asbestos, once
widely used in insulation, causes respiratory ailments and
cancer.

   BOEING SETTLES suit alleging injury from electromagnetic
radiation.
   Attorneys for Robert Strom, a former employee who brought
the class action suit, said Boeing Co. had agreed to pay more
than $500,000 in cash and to purchase an annuity for Mr.
Strom and his family.
   Mr. Strom had alleged that he contracted terminal leukemia
after being exposed to dangerous levels of electromagnetic
radiation while working as an electrical technician for the
Seattle company. Settlement of the case, brought as a class
action on behalf of more than 700 past and present Boeing
workers, also calls for Boeing to provide medical monitoring
of the workers for 10 years. All the class members also
retain the right to seek compensation in the future.
   The settlement is likely to add more fuel to the growing
controversy over the potential health hazards of
electromagnetic energy given off by power lines and a variety
of electrical household appliances. Some studies have
suggested links between cancer and exposure to such
radiation, but no firm conclusions have been established.
   Litigation brought by property owners worried about the
effect of power lines on their land values has been
increasing, but the Strom case is one of the few suits to
allege personal injury, and to produce a public settlement.
Mr. Strom said he was exposed to electromagnetic radiation
while working on a Boeing project designed to determine how
communications systems are affected by blasts of electrical
energy, such as that given off in nuclear explosions. He also
accused Boeing of using workers as human medical research
subjects, testing the effects of exposure to electromagnetic
radiation.
   Michael Withey, a Seattle attorney who helped represent
Mr. Strom, believes the settlement provides a foundation for
similar suits in the future. "I think there's going to be
massive litigation," said Mr. Withey, an attorney in the
Seattle firm of Schroeter, Goldmark and Bender. He was one of
several attorneys handling the case on behalf of Trial
Lawyers for Public Justice, a Washington, D.C., organization
that filed the suit.
   A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the terms of the
settlement, noting that it is still subject to final approval
by a state court judge in Seattle. He noted that Boeing
continues to deny any wrongdoing in the matter.

   TWO LAWYERS are indicted for allegedly falsely claiming
they could bribe officials.
   A federal grand jury in Tampa, Fla., indicted Jerome C.
Berlin and Anthony V. Labozzetta on charges of conspiracy and
fraud in connection with an alleged scheme in which they took
funds from a fraud-riddled Florida securities firm on the
premise that they could win favorable treatment from
regulators to allow the company to continue operating in
exchange for cash payments.
   Mr. Labozzetta, of New York, and Mr. Berlin, of Miami, are
accused of falsely representing to G.I.C. Government
Securities Inc. in Tampa that they could curry favor with
Gerald C. Lewis, the Florida Comptroller, who regulates
banking and securities, and a U.S. senator. According to one
attorney involved in the case, the senator referred to is
Albert Gore of Tennessee.
   The U.S. attorney in Tampa said the defendants' alleged
claims that they could peddle influence and make bribes for
favorable treatment of G.I.C. were entirely false.
   In a statement, Mr. Lewis said, "I have been victimized by
the use of my name in an apparent case of con men conning the
con men." Neither Sen. Gore nor a spokesman could be reached
late yesterday.
   Mr. Labozzetta and his attorney, Leonard Sands, also
couldn't be reached for comment.
   Neal Sonnett, an attorney for Mr. Berlin, a Miami
businessman who infrequently practices law, said the charges
were completely without merit. "Jerry Berlin is an honest and
ethical lawyer and businessman who hasn't done anything
wrong," Mr. Sonnett said, adding that Mr. Berlin had taken a
lie detector test four years ago showing the charges to be
false.
   The indictment alleges, among other things, that in 1985,
Mr. Labozzetta misrepresented to Lonnie O. Kilpatrick,
then-president and chief executive officer of G.I.C., that he
could influence decisions of political officials and
regulators by funneling them money through Mr. Berlin,
painted as an active political fund-raiser who had close
connections to and influence with various officials. Mr.
Berlin is alleged to have joined in the scheme.
   The now-defunct, G.I.C. eventually filed for
bankruptcy-law protection in October 1985, leaving numerous
investors with millions of dollars in losses, and Mr.
Kilpatrick was subsequently convicted of multiple charges of
fraud in Tampa.

   MORGAN &amp; FINNEGAN, an 80-lawyer New York firm specializing
in intellectual property law, opened a Washington office. The
branch is run by Frederick F. Calvetti, who serves on an
of-counsel basis with the firm. Mr. Calvetti was formerly a
partner in the Alexandria, Va., law firm of Stevens, Davis,
Miller &amp; Mosher. Arnold I. Rady, a member of Morgan &amp;
Finnegan's executive committee, says that at least one of the
law firm's New York partners will move to Washington. He said
the new office will service domestic and foreign clients.

   OPEC Rejects Saudi, Venezuelan Bid
   For Meeting, Making Output Boost Likely

   OPEC rejected a call by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for an
emergency meeting, leaving them free to pump more oil on
their own.
   The two had sought a meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to endorse a plan under which
they and other producers would increase output to avoid oil
shortages and runaway prices during the current Middle East
crisis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The rejection of their bid was widely thought to mean that
Saudi Arabia will soon produce more oil anyway. The kingdom
had previously stated that it would do so if OPEC failed to
act. Venezuela is expected to follow suit.
   A statement issued by OPEC's Vienna headquarters yesterday
said the request for a special meeting failed to get the
required support of a majority of OPEC's 13 member nations.
The statement added that Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil
minister and OPEC president, would "meet some OPEC oil
ministers for consultations before the end of the month."
   Despite the decision against an emergency session, both
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela still held out hope for some sort
of OPEC meeting quickly to consider their intention to
replace more than half the four million barrels a day of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes lost to world oil markets. Also,
some others in OPEC who had voted against an immediate
emergency meeting appeared to be having second thoughts.
   Last night, several oil ministers were trying to arrange
at least such an informal meeting, possibly by Friday. Their
goal is to provide some kind of OPEC "umbrella" for the
increased output, mainly to avoid the appearance of a
production free-for-all.
   "The potential for a meeting of some sort, by at least six
or seven, is still there," said Bahman Karbassioun, a
Vienna-based consultant and former OPEC official. The idea
would be to "use OPEC's good offices" for the production
increases that are going to happen anyway "and not damage the
organization," he said.
   In Caracas, meanwhile, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres
Perez was quoted by the government news agency as saying that
several OPEC nations with the potential to increase oil
production expect to meet in the next few days. And he said
Venezuela will increase its production "when there is an
accord within OPEC."
   There wasn't any immediate official response from Saudi
Arabia to the rejection of the call for an emergency meeting.
But one Persian Gulf oil official close to developments
suggested that OPEC's "saying `no' to a conference means
saying `yes' to the idea that everybody can act on his own."
   Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, had made clear
over the weekend that the kingdom, which has been producing
within its OPEC quota of 5.4 million barrels a day, would
shortly increase output by as much as two million barrels a
day with or without OPEC's approval. Among other reasons, Mr.
Nazer cited the damage to the economies of developing
countries from escalating oil prices. And he suggested
Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates would produce an
additional 500,000 barrels a day each, and urged others with
lesser spare capacity to help make up the lost four million
barrels a day.
   Yesterday, President Bush applauded the Saudi decision.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, "The president
notes that we are very pleased by the boost in world-wide
supply being provided by Saudi Arabia, and overall we believe
we have reasonably stable conditions with regard to oil
production and supply."
   Oil prices, which have gained as much as $8 a barrel since
the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, had been expected to
level out this week on the basis of the Saudi public pledge
to increase production. Yesterday, crudes generally were
higher though the rate of climb did slow. Petroleum product
prices rose sharply as market worries centered on possibly
tighter fuel supplies. On the New York Mercantile Exchange,
unleaded gasoline for September delivery surged 4.28 cents to
settle at $1 a gallon.
   Several OPEC nations remain strongly opposed to any change
that would pour more oil onto world markets at this time.
Iraq is among them. It vociferously objects to any OPEC
meeting designed to replace its blockaded oil. And its old
war foe Iran also is opposed to such a meeting.
   Iran's oil revenues have increased sharply since Iraq
invaded Kuwait, and Iran not only has sold most of the oil it
had sitting in storage, but has received substantially higher
prices for the oil. Meanwhile, it is winning new customers on
long-term contracts in Japan who formerly purchased from
Iraq.
   There are also several members of OPEC who maintain that
there isn't any need to increase production while oil
inventories, including government-stored crudes in major
consuming nations, remain high. Indonesia, usually a moderate
on oil prices, proposes that OPEC's ministerial
market-monitoring groups carefully study the supply and
demand situation before considering a full meeting.
   Meanwhile, a meeting of the governing board of the
International Energy Agency that had been scheduled for
Thursday has been postponed until Aug. 31. The delegates to
the Paris-based agency are to consider the consuming nations'
possible responses to the oil-supply crunch. The governing
board first met earlier this month but concluded then that
conditions didn't warrant the use of the emergency
oil-sharing system or drawdowns of strategic oil stores.

   SAN DIEGO -- A small group of union employees involved in
labor contract negotiations with one of the subsidiaries of
Triton Group Ltd. are urging Triton shareholders to reject a
proposed merger with Intermark Inc.
   The merger is unfair to Triton shareholders and would hurt
union members by weakening Triton and its subsidiaries, said
Richard Zell, secretary-treasurer of United Food &amp; Commercial
Workers Local 1119 in the San Francisco area.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the merger agreement, Triton holders would receive
1.4 shares of Intermark common stock for each share of Triton
common. Intermark, a San Diego-based holding company that
already owns a 51.6% stake in Triton, would be the surviving
entity.
   Roughly 300 United Food union members are employed by
Liquor Barn, a retail chain with 65 stores in California.
Only 11 are members of Local 1119, Mr. Zell said. Triton,
also based in San Diego, acquired a two-thirds interest in
Liquor Barn in October.
   In recent weeks, contract talks between Liquor Barn and
its food union employees have stalled. Mr. Zell said that
Liquor Barn management has proposed "a long list of
takeaways" and "is trying to deprive members of union
representation." The workers' contract expired last month.
   Mitchell Woodbury, vice president and corporate counsel
for Triton and Intermark, said that Triton "has been
bargaining in good faith." The merger proposal is "fair, just
and equitable" to shareholders of both companies, he said.
   Mr. Woodbury said Triton has rejected requests by the
union for the company's shareholder lists "as not being made
in compliance with applicable law." Local 1119 purchased
advertising space in this newspaper to urge shareholders to
vote against the merger. Shareholders will vote on the
proposal at Triton's annual meeting Aug. 30.

   WESTWOOD, Kan. -- United Telecommunications Inc. moved to
reorganize the sales and service operation of its troubled
long-distance telephone unit, US Sprint Communications Co.
   The revamping, which United Telecom said will cut 500
administrative jobs while adding "hundreds" of sales
positions, comes on the heels of a dismal second-quarter
showing by Sprint, the nation's third-largest long-distance
provider.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sprint posted a $42 million operating loss for the period,
leading to a 55% profit drop for United Telecom and providing
a nasty shock for Wall Street analysts, who had expected a
much smaller decline. United Telecom stock plunged 23% on the
news to $29.50 a share and recently bottomed out in the $23
to $25 range.
   As part of a previously announced plan to cut 1,000 jobs,
Sprint said it will refocus its National Markets operation,
cutting three of its five marketing and service groups. The
customers served by the three discontinued groups, which
handled accounts generating monthly billings between $2,000
and $10,000, will be split between the two remaining groups.
Those two groups, based in Atlanta and Kansas City, Mo.,
previously handled Fortune 1000 accounts and residential
customers.
   Separately, William Esrey, United Telecom's chairman and
chief executive officer, said in an interview that despite
the recent decline in share price, the company isn't
considering buying back any of its stock.
   Without naming any specific targets, Mr. Esrey said United
Telecom wants to retain its ability to use the stock in place
of cash in making acquisitions.
   A company spokesman said no one, either from within the
company or from the investment community, has been lobbying
for a buy-back.
