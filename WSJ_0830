   The Saddam Hussein affair, starring a villain out of
central casting, has set off an energetic round of huffing
and puffing about the subject of Arabs, interests and allies
in the Middle East. We have our own long record on the
subject of Iraq and its assorted neighbors. We -- who told
you that the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor was
a good thing, and who warned during the U.S. hostage crisis
and the Iraq-Iran war not to get too close to Iraq -- are
here today to tell you that Assad of Hama is a Saddam-style
cutthroat but that the royal families of Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait are not.
   We have read various editorialists and pundits in recent
days who either want the West to trust Syria's Assad to help
us oust the Kuwaiti monarchy, or who want to tar all Arabs in
the region with the Assad brush. Surely it ought to be
possible to bring more sophistication to the subject of the
Arabs' future.

<TEXT>
   A good example of the sort of helpful thinking now needed
on the Gulf region was an article on this page last week by
Saudi lawyer, Abdulaziz H. Fahad ("Thanks to Saddam the Arabs
Outgrow Arabism," August 22). He pointed out that the "Arab
world" has been held together by the threat of riots and
assassination; a distinction was made between the
perpetrators of blackmail and blackmail's victims.
   "The resilience of the Gulf states," Mr. Fahad wrote, "may
finally provide the needed assurance for the Arab world to
join the democratic revolutions of the 1980s. Secure in the
knowledge that their people's loyalty could not be
manipulated by outside forces in the name of Arabism, one
hopes that the perennially insecure Arab regimes may turn
inward and start the process of democratization." (In an
article nearby today, Mr. Fahad proposes that Saudi Arabia
seize the current opportunity to liberate itself from OPEC.)
   If now the Saudis and Kuwaitis learn that they can stand
up to this "Arab world" and that they can in fact rely on the
United States, they indeed have some prospect of evolution
toward democracy.
   There seems to be a general mood in political circles now
to somehow remove the leadership in places such as Kuwait or
even Saudi Arabia with a wave of our hand and turn the
country over to the people. Recall, though, what followed
when we judged the Shah to be irredeemably undemocratic.
Perhaps the Persian Gulf will at last have some chance of
evolving toward greater pluralism if Western intellectuals
stop agitating a politics of overthrow for its governments.
   The Kuwaitis have already held some democratic
experiments, and in general have done well by their people.
The Saudis have been host to the Islamic pilgrimages, with
the risks that has demonstrably carried. Hosni Mubarak has
been struggling, at considerable personal risk, to modernize
the politics and economy of an Egypt that in the early days
of Arabism gave the world Nasser.
   Contrast these efforts at political and social melioration
with the Syria of Hafez al Assad. Assad not only did Hama
(subdued at cost of at least 10,000 lives in 1982), but is in
military control of the territory in which the
Lebanon-related U.S. hostages are being held. If, as now
seems to be the case, these hostages are held by relatives of
the terrorists who are prisoners in Kuwait, then everyone
knows exactly who they are. The Syrian authorities with the
troops and police on the ground should be held responsible.
   If the forces in the Gulf now led by the U.S. eliminate
the Iraqi threat, it seems likely that the Middle East will
undergo a long period of reordering its status quo. It is
certainly in the interests of the West and of the populations
long under the heel of Arabism to see significant parts of
this region begin the process of integrating with an orderly
world system. When that process begins, it will be important
for the West to recognize Arabs who want to help create a
civilized world and Arabs who wish to prevent it.

   NEW YORK -- Investors bid bond and stock prices higher as
oil prices tumbled on news that OPEC agreed to boost output.
Also, market-buoying rumors circulated that Iraq had a plan
for leaving Kuwait.
   The October futures contract for light crude oil fell
$1.96 to $25.92, the lowest level in nearly three weeks. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average, which stayed in a narrow range
early in the session, gained 17.58 points to 2632.43 in
sluggish trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Long-term Treasury bond prices added 1 1/4 points, or
$12.50 for each $1,000 face amount, also in light activity.
The dollar ended mixed in an equally quiet currency market,
with traders slimming their holdings in advance of the long
weekend and U.S. economic data due out next week.
   Much of the initial impetus for rising stock and bond
prices came from Vienna, where 10 of the 13 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to
produce more oil to offset most of the supply loss from Iraq
and Kuwait.
   As for unsubstantiated reports that Iraq was preparing a
specific plan for ending its occupation of Kuwait, "It's hard
to say whether there's any validity" to them, said Robert
Farrell, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch. But they
"caused bonds to rally and stocks followed," he said.
   Mr. Farrell noted the stocks' rise was powered by the same
issues that led the Dow industrials to nearly 3000 -- drug,
health-care stocks and other shares of companies with strong
profit growth.
   The bond market drew additional strength from a successful
auction of fiveyear U.S. Treasury notes. Bidding was
unusually strong among individual investors, said Raymond
Stone, managing director at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates.
   In currency markets, much of the action again was focused
on the yen. A rumor that Japan's central bank was poised to
boost a key interest rate continued to bolster the yen, said
Yoichi Sakaguchi, chief currency trader at Sanwa Bank.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose on volume of 134.2 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where advancing issues outnumbered
decliners, 972 to 508.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices jumped. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond fell to 8.92%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency rose to 1.5595 marks from 1.5563 late Tuesday, and
fell to 143.60 yen from 143.73.

   Money Fund Yields
   Resumed Decline
   In the Latest Week

<LP>
   Yields on taxable money-market mutual funds resumed their
slide in the week ended Tuesday, and investment inflows
slowed markedly.
   The average seven-day compound yield of 433 taxable funds
slipped to 7.76% from 7.80%, according to IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report. The annual yield had increased
fractionally in the previous week after declining since early
July. Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After pouring several billion dollars a week into money
funds for three weeks, investors added just $475.4 million to
the taxable funds in the latest week, the Holliston, Mass.,
newsletter reported. The total now stands at $400.9 billion,
by Donoghue's count.
   "Recent optimism about the Mideast crisis has reduced the
turmoil in the stock and bond markets," said Martha
Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's, explaining the small
increase. She noted that institutional investors took about
$528 million out of taxable funds, meaning that individuals
added a total of about $1 billion.
   Institutional investors typically take cash out of money
funds when yields on competing investments look better. Stock
prices, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, have
risen somewhat in the past few days, and yields on Treasury
bills sold at auction have moved slightly higher in the past
two weeks.
   Yields on taxable money funds are unlikely to change much
any time soon. The average maturity of the funds' investments
-- such things as commercial paper (short-term corporate
IOUs), bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills --
remained at a fairly long 45 days for the fourth consecutive
week.
   Yields on tax-free funds rose in the week ended Tuesday.
The average seven-day compound yield increased to 5.34% from
5.26%. The latest yield is equivalent to 7.42% for an
investor in the 28% tax bracket and 7.97% for someone paying
33% in taxes.
   Assets of the 229 tax-exempt funds tracked by Donoghue's
declined $392.6 million, to $80.7 billion. Average maturity
lengthened two days, to 55 days.

   Laura Ashley
   To Sell 15% Stake
   To Jusco of Japan

   LONDON -- Laura Ashley Holdings PLC agreed to sell a 15%
stake to Japanese chain-store operator Jusco Co. in an effort
to lighten the troubled British company's debt load and
expand in Asia.
   Under the agreement, subject to shareholder approval,
Jusco would pay #29.9 million ($58.1 million) for 35.2
million new Laura Ashley shares. The per-share price of 85
pence is 73% above Laura Ashley's trading level of 49 pence
late Tuesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, Laura Ashley said it would sell more than
half the equity in its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, Revman
Industries Inc. Jusco would acquire about 48% of the equity,
with Revman's management taking as much as 5% more. The
transaction, which values all of Revman at about $35 million,
will make Revman an associated company of Laura Ashley and
remove its roughly $27 million in borrowings from the parent
company's balance sheet.
   For Laura Ashley, the Jusco deal offers "room to maneuver,
and steps up the pace in the Far East," said Nick Bubb, a
London-based analyst at Morgan Stanley. But, he said, until
Laura Ashley shifts from costly U.K. factories to less-costly
Asian sources, "I'm reluctant to say they've turned the
corner."
   Jusco and Laura Ashley already have a retail joint
venture, Laura Ashley Japan Co. Under yesterday's agreement,
Jusco will boost its stake in the venture to 60% from 50%,
although Laura Ashley is to retain control of its brand name
and receive increased royalties.
   Laura Ashley home furnishings, in particular, are
increasingly popular in Japan, said Sir Bernard Ashley,
chairman and co-founder. "We have tremendous opportunities
there, and this will unlock them," he said. Sir Bernard
characterized Jusco as a "friendly, passive investor taking a
long-term view." Yesterday's agreement stipulates that Jusco
can't raise or lower its 15% share of Laura Ashley's enlarged
share capital without approval from the company's board.
   The Ashley family's stake in the company would be diluted
to 59.2% from 69.7% currently. That holding could fall to
54.2%, as the family has agreed to give Jusco a right of
first refusal to buy an additional 5% stake at a price to be
agreed on later. Sir Bernard said his family isn't
necessarily committed to retaining a majority holding in the
company, although he doesn't envisage relinquishing control
"in the immediate future."
   In a statement, Jusco's chairman and chief executive
officer, Takuya Okada, said the arrangements would "enhance
the global presence of both groups" and "contribute to the
improvement of Laura Ashley's financial position." Jusco,
which operates more than 450 retail outlets in Japan, had
pretax profit of 39.4 billion yen ($274.2 million) on sales
of 1.35 trillion yen in the year ended Feb. 20.

   Medicine:
   Nonhuman Gene Is Successfully Implanted in Patients

   Medical researchers cleared the last big scientific hurdle
to gene-based treatment of major diseases by implanting a
nonhuman gene into patients in a clinical trial.
   Proponents believe the accomplishment will lead to new
treatments for cancer, immune system ailments and hereditary
diseases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's the first time that foreign genes have been
introduced into humans," said Steven A. Rosenberg, chief of
surgery at the National Cancer Institute and the leader of
the team that performed the experiment. "It's the base from
which we will begin using gene therapy to help people who are
sick."
   In the trial, Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues attached a
special marker gene with no therapeutic value to certain
cancer-fighting cells in five patients with advanced
melanoma, a fatal skin cancer. The implanted gene survived in
all five patients for at least 19 days -- and in one patient
for as long as 189 days; it turned up in the tumors of three
of the five patients, who suffered no side effects attributed
to the gene. "This showed the genes can be introduced safely
and efficiently," Dr. Rosenberg said. "Now we just have to
learn how to apply it to a variety of diseases."
   Years of work in both the laboratory and the clinic remain
before effective gene-based treatments are widely available.
But the accomplishment "is tantamount to the first satellite
that was launched that showed we could escape gravity," said
Nathan A. Berger, a researcher at Ireland Cancer Center,
University Hospitals and Case Western Reserve University,
Cleveland. "That opened up the whole space program. This is
going to open up a whole new era of gene transplant for
therapeutic purposes."
   The results also strengthen the belief that doctors can
use the body's innate cancer-fighting cells as couriers to
deliver cells with more powerful, gene-modified anti-cancer
properties to tumors. The next step is to replace the inert
marker gene with such potent genes in an effort to shrink or
eliminate the tumors.
   A report on Dr. Rosenberg's work appears in today's New
England Journal of Medicine. Collaborators include Michael
Blaese, also of the cancer institute, and W. French Anderson,
of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Some of the
results were previously disclosed at scientific meetings.
   The first tests of gene therapy are expected to be on
melanoma patients and on children with severe combined immune
deficiency, or ADA deficiency, which leaves victims
vulnerable to death from infection. Proposals for these
experiments were approved late last month by the National
Institutes of Health and await clearance by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration. Dr. Rosenberg said the treatments could
begin within two months.
   Current immune system approaches to cancer have been only
partly successful. Although some patients have achieved total
remission for months or even years, immunotherapy works only
about half the time, and in most patients lasts only for a
short period before tumors begin growing again. "There's
enormous room for improvement," Dr. Rosenberg says.
   While the anti-cancer strategy calls for genes to bolster
the body's existing cancer-fighting agents, scientists will
try a different tack against ADA deficiency. Here they will
seek to insert a gene that makes an enzyme called adenosine
deaminase, which eliminates toxic wastes from the body.
Victims of the disease lack the gene and thus don't produce
the enzyme. Similar efforts are expected in treatment of such
ills as sickle-cell anemia, muscular dystrophy and
hemophilia.
   Some researchers are looking at bone marrow cells or skin
cells as possible places to implant therapeutic genes, Dr.
Berger said. Dr. Rosenberg has focused on lymphocytes, or
certain white blood cells, as part of his strategy to marshal
the body's own immune system to fight cancer. In the latest
experiment, Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues attached the
gene marker to cells called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes,
or TILs, which congregate in tumors as part of the body's
immune response to invading cancer cells.
   The researchers extracted TILs from the patients' tumors
and steeped them in interleukin-2, a growth factor
manufactured by Cetus Corp., Emeryville, Calif., to produce
huge amounts of the cancer-fighting TILs. Patients were also
treated intravenously with doses of interleukin-2. In
previous trials, the researchers have reinfused these TILs
into cancer patients. Tumors shrank in about half the cases,
and total remissions resulted in about 10% of patients.
   This time, researchers added another step, splicing the
gene marker into the mixture before reinfusing it. The marker
gene was derived from bacteria resistant to the antibiotic
neomycin. Later, the scientists exposed tumor biopsies and
blood samples to neomycin. The antibiotic killed cells that
lacked the resistant marker gene, but some cells survived the
antibiotic, proving that the implanted gene -- and its TIL
companion -- survived in the blood stream or had traveled to
the tumor. Had the body's immune system attacked the foreign
gene, it would have been a major setback to the gene-therapy
effort.
   Tumors regressed in all three patients whose tumors showed
evidence of the marker gene and one patient remains in total
remission 13 months after the therapy. These patients
responded to the TIL treatment itself, not to the marker
gene, the researchers said. The other two patients died
within a year of the start of treatment from progressive
cancer.
   The hope is that replacing the marker gene with a gene
having tumor-fighting properties, such as tumor necrosis
factor, interleukin-2 or interferon alpha, will enhance the
TILs' ability to kill the cancer cells. The experiment also
showed that some TILs are more capable of migrating to tumors
than others. Extracting these "tumor-reactive" TILs,
cultivating them with interleukin-2 and reinfusing them could
result in more effective treatment, whether or not they
carried gene-spliced cargo to the tumor.

   STOCKHOLM -- Smarting from a third consecutive quarter of
plunging pretax profit, AB Volvo announced plans to trim
heavy truck production in the U.S. for the rest of this year
and begin hefty job cuts at both its car and truck divisions.
   The Swedish auto concern said profit before taxes skidded
56% in the second quarter, to 1 billion Swedish kronor
($174.7 million) from 2.29 billion kronor a year earlier.
Pretax profit was down 54% for the first six months, to 2.06
billion kronor from 4.48 billion kronor the previous year.

   "It's quite clear that market conditions this year are
tougher than we expected. Downturns in some of our larger
markets -- the U.S., U.K. and Scandinavia -- have hit us
pretty hard," said Christer Zetterberg, Volvo's chief
operating officer.
   Mr. Zetterberg admitted the company "doesn't expect to get
much help from markets during the rest of this year or 1991."
Consequently, Volvo management has ordered tough cost-cutting
steps "which are necessary to restore our Swedish
competitiveness," he said.
   Investors seemed to welcome the move. Volvo B-free shares,
the series most traded internationally, jumped 10 kronor to
close at 325 kronor in trading yesterday on the Stockholm
Stock Exchange.
   Volvo intends to eliminate 5,000 jobs by the end of next
year, with about 80% of the layoffs affecting car plants in
Sweden.
   But overseas units also are beginning to feel the pinch.
Volvo GM heavy Truck Corp. -- the three-year-old alliance
with General Motors Corp. -- is about to lay off 350
employees, about 8.5% of its total payroll, and reduce 1990
production by 2,000 trucks or about 10%.
   Sagging heavy truck demand this year has taken its toll.
Volvo said unit sales of its heavy trucks in the U.S.
declined 22% during the first six months. The total U.S.
market fell 18% during the same period.
   Volvo's sales dropped 2.4% in the second quarter to 22.92
billion kronor from 23.48 billion kronor the previous year.
First half sales shrank 4.2% to 44.59 billion kronor from
46.55 billion kronor a year earlier, the company said.

   Tokyo stocks retreated on dealer-led selling Wednesday, as
profits were taken after three sessions of advances for the
Nikkei index. Traders said arbitrage selling added to the
decline.
   In London, share prices closed slightly down, yet far
above the day's lows, as sentiment drifted toward a stalemate
on the London market's near-term prospects.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues was off 815.97 points
at 24894.79; on Tuesday, the index gained 569 points.
   In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose 34.68 points to
close the morning session at 24929.47.
   Wednesday's first section volume was estimated at 430
million shares, down from 504.2 million Tuesday.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first section issues,
which rose 42.92 points Tuesday, lost 36.09 to 1911.42 on
Wednesday.
   The second section index, which jumped 88.55 points
Tuesday, eased 4.96 to 3687.38, on volume estimated at 9.8
million shares, up from 9.3 million shares a day earlier.
   Press reports that the Bank of Japan was negotiating with
the Finance Ministry on raising the official discount rate --
the interest rate on loans to banks -- were viewed as
weakening the Japanese government bond market, but traders
said this scarcely affected stocks. The Bank of Japan raised
the rate 0.75 percentage point to 6% early Thursday, after
denying on Wednesday that the talks had been held.
   "The market's already discounted a 75-basis-point rise," a
trader said before the rate increase was announced. A basis
point is 1/100th of a percentage point.
   The bulk of the stock market's declines stemmed from
dealer selling, traders said, with profit-taking coming on
shares that led the three-session rally from Friday. Declines
caused by arbitrage selling in tiny chunks throughout the day
"complemented" the dealer-led selling, a trader said.
Pressure remained on futures indexes, keeping them at a
discount to the cash indexes and allowing for limited
arbitrage selling.
   The Mideast confrontation kept trading thin and oriented
for the short term, with only fringe players participating in
bargain-hunting, observers said.
   Meanwhile, the financial daily Nikkei Keizai Shimbun said
Nomura Securities and leading commercial banks, including
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank, were
reportedly involved, perhaps unwittingly, in a 1.7
billion-yen ($11.8 million) Colombian drug money laundering
scheme. The news hit the market in midafternoon, traders
said, but stock prices appeared little affected, continuing
lower at a steady pace. Observers also said the likelihood
that the institutions will be implicated in the scandal is
slim.
   Shares that fell as a result of profit-taking included
blue-chip leaders such as Sony, down 290 yen at 7,260 yen
($50.55).
   TDK lost 140 to 6,060, Kyocera slid 170 to 7,530, Fanuc
fell 200 to 5,800, and Hitachi dropped 40 to 1,350.
   Nomura Securities fell 80 to 1,710 and Nikko Securities
declined 50 to 900, but Yamaichi Securities gained 9 to 960.
Daiwa Securities slipped 10 to 1,100.
   Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank fell 100 to 1,900, Mitsubishi Bank
lost 60 to 1,850 and Bank of Tokyo declined 40 to 1,150.
   Nippon Mining was up 3 at 704, Sumitomo Mining rose 10 to
1,300, Dowa Mining fell 1 to 714, and Mitsui Mining rose 25
to 750. Teikoku Oil firmed 50 to 1,350, and Mitsubishi Oil
rose 19 to 969.
   In London, traders had expected Wall Street to drift
downward, but an about-face in early New York trading helped
the London market to its flat finish. A lack of genuine
buying interest was again a main feature, and traders
attributed price fluctuations to market makers covering their
positions. "The market is in for a long stalemate," a trader
said, adding that volume is unlikely to pick up soon.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell
0.4 point to close at 2125.7. The day's low was 2210.1, its
high 2128.1. Volume was 297.3 million shares, slightly more
than Tuesday's total of 281.6 million shares, which is the
low for the year. The FT 30-share index finished up 1.5
points at 1658.9.
   Several companies posted interim results that were in line
with traders' expectations. Cadbury Schweppes, after
reporting a 12% rise in pretax profit, closed at 325 pence
($6.32), up 7 pence.
   Ladbrokes PLC, which also recorded a 12% rise in pretax
profit, fell 5 to 274. Traders said sentiment was affected by
a brokerage firm's downgrading of full-year earnings
forecasts by #10 million ($19.4 million) to #340 million.
   Pearson PLC, its first-half pretax profit up 15%, was down
4 pence at 690 pence.
   W.H. Smith, a diversified bookseller that had a 1.8%
decline in pretax profit for the year, fell 5 to 321.
   Carlton Communications, downgraded by Barclays de Zoete
Wedd on the belief that the strong pound continues to dent
its U.S. earnings, fell 8 to 337.
   Prices for many oil stocks were firmer, despite an
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreement to
raise production. The Middle East conflict still remains a
potentially bullish factor for crude prices, traders said.
Enterprise Oil climbed to 651, up 12. Lasmo Oil shares rose 7
to 481.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris and
Frankfurt, marginally higher in Stockholm, lower in Brussels,
Milan and Madrid, and mixed in Zurich and Amsterdam. South
African gold stocks closed slightly higher. The Paris climb
was a response to gains in the Paris bond market and was
fueled by optimism about the oil price outlook, which also
prompted Frankfurt's moderate advance. Trading was thin on
most bourses.
   Stock prices closed lower in Hong Kong, Taipei, Singapore,
Wellington and Manila, and higher in Seoul, and were little
changed in Sydney, as overall activity was generally thin.
Hong Kong stocks slumped 2%. Taipei's main stock index
nose-dived 5.57% on profit-taking, which also pushed prices
down in Manila. Seoul's rise in prices was the third in a
row.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The

   Ladbroke Group PLC, a London hotel, retailing and betting
concern, reported a 12% rise in pretax profit for the first
six months of the year, led by strong growth in its Hilton
International hotels chain.
   Pretax profit for the half year ending June 30 increased
to 158 million pounds ($307 million) from 141 million pounds.
However, the gain left earnings slightly below market
forecasts, which ranged between 160 million and 170 million
pounds.

   Profit after taxes and minority interests firmed to 112

from 11.4 pence.

   Over-the-counter stocks missed the climb in
exchange-listed shares as gloomy news in the technology
sector shadowed smaller stocks.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 1.08 to 381.78, a 0.3%
loss, as volume edged up to 118.1 million from 117.8 million
Tuesday. Despite the day's loss, advancing shares edged out
decliners, 987 to 887. However, 120 stocks fell to new lows
while only 13 reached new highs.

   3Com lost nearly a third of its market value and led the
day's bad-news bearers with an unexpectedly bleak short-term
outlook. That news came just one day after Oracle Systems
skidded on nervousness about its near-term earnings outlook.
   "People were spooked by what happened with 3Com and
Oracle," said Jerry Newman, an institutional trader in San
Francisco for Cowen &amp; Co.
   At Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco, shares sold by
institutions were being bought primarily by small investors,
according to James Tarantino, head of OTC trading there.
   A number of large technology issues ended the day lower.
Intel fell 5/8 to 35; Apple Computer slid 7/8 to 37 1/4; and
Microsoft dropped 2 3/8 to 60 1/2. The Nasdaq Industrial
Index, which includes many computer stocks and larger OTC
issues, fell 1.45 to 409.26.
   Also pressuring the market was its largest utility, MCI
Communications, which fell 1 5/8 to 31 3/4. The Nasdaq
Utility Index fell 7.19 to 497.81. Financial issues fared
better as four Nasdaq financial indexes posted gains.
   Investors continued to punish the stocks of companies that
surprised them with bad news. 3Com tumbled 3 7/8 to 8 3/4 on
more than 4.8 million shares after delivering analysts a
pessimistic near-term outlook. Pharmacy Management Services
dove 3 1/8 to 7 7/8, well below its $12-a-share initial
offering price in April, after cautioning that upcoming
first-quarter earnings for fiscal 1991 will fall below
expectations.
   Investors also reacted strongly to the resignation of One
Price Clothing president Brian P. Woolf; the stock plummeted
3 5/8 to 10 1/8. And Barry's Jewelers fell 1 1/2 to 4 1/4
after reporting widening losses.
   Investors took 3Com to the woodshed after officials with
the Santa Clara, Calif., maker of computer communication
systems told analysts the declining U.S. economy is
pressuring their near-term outlook, Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report said. The stock was the day's most active as
more than 4.8 million shares changed hands.
   3Com Chief Financial Officer Christopher B. Paisley told
DJPIR the company is cautious about the short term and called
it "appropriate" for expectations to come down. However, he
called the sell-off an "overreaction" to management's
comments. He also said the company's board will consider a
share buy-back program at a Sept. 20 meeting, in addition to
an existing one-million share repurchase program.
   Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. analyst Therese M. Murphy
advised investors to avoid 3Com shares until revenue growth
picks up, probably not until late in the second fiscal
quarter ending November or early in the third quarter. Both
she and Salomon Brothers analyst Michele Guite also cut their
estimates for the company's 1991 first quarter and full year.
   Ms. Murphy said 3Com indicated sales of both its software
and server products have been hurt by confusion about the
latest local area network manager products by Microsoft Corp.
3Com acknowledged that "the clear beneficiary of this
confusion is Novell, which is the established market share
leader," she added.
   Pharmacy Management said it's comfortable with estimates
it will earn 50 to 77 cents a share in fiscal 1991 ending
next July, compared with an estimate of 27 cents a share for
1990 provided by First Call. However, the Tampa, Fla.,
provider of medical cost containment services and products to
workers' compensation payers and claimants said that
first-quarter earnings will fall below earlier expectations
because of expansion costs.
   One Price Clothing skidded after the departure of
president Brian Woolf. Robinson Humphrey Co. analyst Dan R.
Wewer Jr. slashed his investment opinion on the South
Carolina retailer to "sell" from "buy" and lowered his 1990
earnings estimate, noting the company indicated sales are
running below plan.
   Mr. Woolf told DJPIR his resignation was "a very amicable
leaving," and attributed his decision to differences in
management style. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Henry
D. Jacobs Jr., who will assume Mr. Woolf's post until a
replacement is found, also told DJPIR that recent retail
sales haven't been up to expectations, although they aren't
"alarmingly low."
   Barry's Jewelers reported that its loss for the fourth
quarter ended May 31 widened to $2.24 a share from 15 cents a
year earlier, citing increased provisions for bad debts. For
the year, the Duarte, Calif., operator of jewelry stores
reported a loss of $3.10 a share, compared with net income of
$1.21 a year earlier.
   Trans World Music skidded 2 to 20 1/4 after the Albany,
N.Y., retailer of prerecorded music and video products said
it postponed a one-million-share stock offering originally
indicated at $33 a share.
   Interphase fell 1 to 4 1/4. The Dallas maker of
microcomputer products said it will take a charge of 85 cents
a share in the third quarter ended July 31 after deciding to
discontinue its majority-owned subsidiary, OMNI Solutions
Inc. Before the charge, Interphase had net income of three
cents a share for the quarter.
   Among the day's gainers, Computer Data Systems jumped 1
3/8 to 8 5/8 after the board of the Rockville, Md., data
processor authorized a share repurchase of as many as 200,000
of its 2.8 million common shares outstanding.
   International Lease Finance gained 1 7/8 to 31 5/8 on more
than 1.2 million shares after American International Group
and International Lease Finance said they may complete their
proposed merger even if the closing price of American
International is below $66.45 a share.
   Sierra Tucson tumbled 4 to 12 1/4 before the National
Association of Securities Dealers halted trading in the stock
for pending news. After the market closed, the Tucson
operator of alcohol and drug treatment centers said it
expects a charge of 17 cents a share in 1990 because of
higher initial operating costs at its German operations. The
company now expects earnings of 14 cents a share for the
third quarter and 73 cents for the full year, compared with
year-earlier net income of 20 cents and 62 cents,
respectively.

   Letters to the Editor:
   Turkey Is Not Forgotten -- or Forgiven

   "The Forgotten Ally" (editorial, Aug. 10) is off the mark.
Turkey is scarcely forgotten -- it is the third-highest
recipient of U.S. military aid. In addition, over the past
decade it has received loans and other economic support from
Europe. It has also received up to a billion dollars a year
in support and aid from the Soviet Union and its erstwhile
satellites -- the only NATO country to do so.
   The congressional limits to U.S. aid to Turkey resulted
from its invasion of Cyprus and continuing threats against
another NATO member, Greece. It is also worth recalling the
more complete Turkish record on human rights and on the
treatment of ethnic minorities. It is uneven at best. While
it is true that it has harbored Kurds fleeing gruesome
conditions in Iraq and Iran, their brethren have been
subjected to humiliations and torture in Turkey. Amnesty
International and similar organizations have been documenting
these human-rights violations for years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Other ethnic minorities no longer present problems because
they have been persecuted out of existence. Pogroms in 1955
and later reduced the historic Greek Christian community in
Istanbul and the islands of Imbros and Tenedos from 250,000
people to fewer than 4,000 today.
   The problem of Western perceptions of Turkey derives from
that country's record. Even the more-enlightened Turkish
leaders -- for example, President Turgut Ozalhave never faced
up to these horrors. Turkey's unwillingness or inability to
face up to the barbaric moments in its recent past is the
main reason why European peoples and governments "look down
their noses."
   Aristide D. Caratzas
   New Rochelle, N.Y.
   ---
   Your editorial on Turkey deserves a Pulitzer Prize for
distortion for portraying Turkey as the champion of the West,
a model of democracy and a haven for the ethnically
oppressed. You trivialize Turkey's past and recent record
regarding the mistreatment of minorities (Armenians, Kurds),
the occupation of Cyprus and the lack of true democratic
pluralism.
   Furthermore, you fail to acknowledge that Turkey's
cautious assistance in the current Middle East crisis is a
result of political and economic considerations, including
promises of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance, rather
than of Turkish kinship with the West. Indeed, any Western
bias toward Turkey is due not to religion but rather to
Turkey's lack of respect for human rights and its 16-year
military occupation of Cyprus. Turkey is, of course, a
strategic friend and ally of the U.S.; as such, it would be
served best by our helping it overcome its shortcomings
instead of sweeping them under an Anatolian carpet.
   George Polychroniou
   Reading, Mass.

   Turkey has grossly violated human rights in Cyprus since
it invaded the island in 1974, occupying 37% of its territory
and forcibly uprooting some 200,000 Greek-Cypriots. Turkey
consistently ignores numerous resolutions that call for the
immediate withdrawal of its occupation troops.
   Indeed it could be argued that Iraq took the consistent
refusal of Turkey to abide by the U.N. resolutions on Cyprus
as a precedent to invade Kuwait.
   Sotiris Kattos
   Press Counselor

   Your editorial referred to Turkey as "secular." In terms
of being a "secular" state, Christian churches in Turkey are
prohibited from ringing their church bells -- except perhaps
once on Sunday. Christian clergymen are prohibited from
wearing clerical outfits in public. The Christian religion in
Turkey is terribly oppressed -- but I don't think the term
"secular" is the right word for this situation. In these
terms, the modern world's ultimate "secular" leader would be
Stalin.
   You also refer to Turkey as "democratic." In Turkey,
torture of political prisoners is so widespread that Amnesty
International does not list individual names, but only round
numbers, of the 250,000 Turkish political prisoners tortured
in recent years.
   Like our previous aid to Iraq, aid to Turkey could prove
to be a very smart short-term strategy -- and a very stupid
long-term strategy.

   NATIONAL GYPSUM Co. (Dallas) -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of this construction
conern predicting that falling gypsum wallboard prices would
"erode the company's already very thin" reserves for making
interest payments. Moody's said it lowered to Caa from
single-B-3 the ratings on priority senior subordinated
debentures and subordinated debentures. The gypsum wallboard
industry continues to suffer from overcapacity and depressed
price levels, Moody's said. The poor outlook for housing
starts combined with what Moody's called "the unlikelihood of
a near-term turnaround in the company's performance" raises
doubts about National Gypsum's ability "to generate enough
cash to service its debt through the downcycle," Moody's
said. Moody's noted that National Gypsum's debt is
nonrecourse to Lafarge Coppee, a French construction company
that owns 54% of National Gypsum. National Gypsum declined to
comment.

   CALFED Inc. (Los Angeles) -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. said it lowered its rating on this financial services

The rating concern also downgraded the California Federal
Bank unit's long-term deposits and senior debt to Ba-2 from
Baa-3, and short-term deposits and commercial paper to not
prime from prime-3. Moody's said about $875 million of debt
is affected by the changes. Moody's said its action reflects
California Federal's "somewhat weak" capital, and increased
uncertainty about the future of California commercial real
estate. A Calfed spokesman said the Moody's move reflects the
"increasingly pessimistic outlook for California real estate
values."

   Sounds Like a Good Way to Have
   Modern Art Reflect Modern Life

   Some folks think modern art is rubbish. Susan Pedicord, on
the other hand, thinks modern rubbish should be art.
   In an effort to improve the environment -- and perhaps
nurture budding Picassos -- Ms. Pedicord has opened a store
in Montpelier, Vt., to recycle trash as art supplies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Appropriately named "Restore," the shop offers everything
from discarded legal pads, partly used wallpaper rolls and
pillow stuffing to clothespin springs, red plastic bottle
caps and wood chips. Customers -- mostly artists, parents and
kids -- use the materials for such arts and crafts as
collages, sculptures, mobiles and toys. Teachers also load up
on supplies for use in art classes.
   "Most of the materials are perfectly good. They have one
little scratch or wrinkle, and they're no longer useful to a
company," says Ms. Pedicord. An artist herself, she came up
with the idea for Restore three years ago after hoarding
leftover scraps from an art project.
   Since then, she has persuaded 100 Vermont businesses to
channel their scraps to Restore instead of burdening
landfills. "Our environmental goal is to get waste out of the
waste stream," says Ms. Pedicord. She spends much of her time
driving from bottle makers to brush makers to quilt makers --
loading up her small pickup truck with their rubbish. And she
also approaches new companies, touring their facilities in
search of usable waste.
   Vermont artists and kids love the store -- especially the
prices. On opening day this month, more than 200 people
showed up. At 10-for-a-penny, mailing labels and promotional
stickers were among the hot items. "Kids love stickers,"
explains Ms. Pedicord. But 1990 U.S. Census pencils were also
selling fast.
   Restore, a unit of Restore Resources Unlimited, a
nonprofit, waste-reduction organization, soon will begin
exhibiting the work of local artists who've used discarded
materials in their pieces. "We wanted to give the art
community both access to inexpensive art materials and a new
place to exhibit their work," says Ms. Pedicord. In addition,
the retailer may sponsor recycled-art competitions at several
local schools.
   Ms. Pedicord maintains that her store represents "the kind
of creative problem solving that will help solve the
environmental problems we're facing today." She doesn't
address, however, what happens when her customers throw away
their art projects.

   NEW YORK -- Another monthly decline in new construction
contracts points to still lower levels of building in the
months ahead, according to F.W. Dodge, the forecasting unit
of McGraw-Hill Inc.
   Dodge said setbacks in all segments in July resulted in an
annualized construction startup rate of $232.31 billion, down
from $244.85 billion in June. The seasonally adjusted rate
brought the Dodge index down to 148 from 156 the previous
month. The index compares current contracting with a 1982
base of 100.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Restrictive credit, budget austerity, and a stagnant
economy are more than enough reasons for the sorry state of
construction in 1990," said George A. Christie, vice
president and chief economist for Dodge. Energy inflation is
an added impediment to improvement in the near future.
   The weakest segment, nonresidential building, dropped 8%
to $80.5 billion, as a result of lagging office construction,
which fell 23% to the lowest rate in a decade. Nonbuilding
construction, including public works and utilities, was down
7% to $42.4 billion, and homebuilding was down 2% to $109.4
billion.
   Through seven months of 1990, $143 billion of new
construction was started, 8% less than the comparable 1989
period. The most severe regional declines continued to be in
the Northeast, down 24%, and the Southeast, down 15% through
July.

   Changes in Clean Air Bill Aren't Likely
   Despite Impact of Crisis in Middle East

   WASHINGTON -- The Mideast crisis will probably force a
closer look at the cost of the clean air bill -- the biggest
energy legislation around -- but the measure isn't expected
to change much.
   The jump in oil prices and increased likelihood of
recession in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait have
given new ammunition to White House and industry lobbyists
who have attacked the bill's steep price tag. "This sobering
Middle East crisis should cause everyone to re-evaluate
America's energy priorities and should raise grave concerns
about the new Clean Air Act," said Richard Seibert, vice
president for resources and environment at the National
Association of Manufacturers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration estimates that the legislation
would impose annual costs of $25 billion on industry when it
is fully phased in, with utilities and oil refiners -- and
their customers -- among the hardest hit. The measure, which
is pending in a House-Senate conference committee, would
impose the nation's first controls on acid rain, curb
cancer-causing emissions from factories and take a new
approach to cleaning up smog in all U.S. cities by 2010.
   At the same time, however, powerful forces stand in the
way of any effort to make wholesale changes in the measure.
An attempt to substantively alter the measure would risk
unraveling the series of carefully crafted compromises that
was worked out over more than a year of negotiation. With
enactment -- and the congressional elections -- in sight, few
lawmakers are likely to be willing to take that risk.
   Furthermore, the strength of the environmental movement
remains a strong counterweight to any new push by business or
the White House to scale back the measure on cost or any
other grounds. "The people who have argued against clean air
for a long time will use this recession argument against it
now," said Daniel Weiss, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "But
with the deadlines in this bill, there will be plenty of time
for business to comply long after any recession is just a
memory."
   Most important, the impact of the Mideast instability is
blunted because it can support many sides in the debate.
Besides bolstering arguments for limiting the clean air
bill's costs, it also helps people who want to use the
measure to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil.
Sometimes the two goals are at odds.
   For example, both the Senate and House measures would
force the oil industry to begin selling cleaner-burning
reformulated gasoline in some cities. The industry has
contended that the provisions would force them to close
refineries temporarily and could boost the price of gasoline
as much as 15 cents a gallon in those cities. Both effects
would be particularly undesirable at a time when the economy
is weak and gasoline prices are rising.
   Over the longer term, though, replacement of gasoline with
non-gasoline additives -- as the provisions would require --
could help reduce oil imports. Higher gasoline prices would
promote conservation.
   Still, fears about the economy may well make a difference
in the clean air debate, at least at the margins. They could
help bolster the less costly provision in areas, such as
provisions designed to reduce industrial smog emissions,
where one house's bill is more stringent than the other.
Industry also may be able to use the crisis to help push back
effective dates, such as deadlines for cleaning up auto
tailpipe emissions.
   In addition, the Mideast crisis may boost small business's
efforts to win a softening of provisions that would impose
additional requirements for permits and paperwork. For
energy-intensive small businesses, "it's almost a double
whammy with clean air kicking in and the Iraqi situation,"
said Terry Hill, a spokesman for the National Federation of
Independent Business.

   E-Systems Agrees
   To Buy Defense Unit
   From Hadson Corp.

   DALLAS -- E-Systems Inc. said it agreed to acquire Hadson
Corp.'s HRB Systems Inc. for $65 million, half what Hadson
paid for it only two years ago.
   Like many defense contractors, HRB's sales have declined
in recent years because of "the breakout of peace," said
Hadson President J. Michael Adcock, explaining why the unit's
value dropped 50%. In 1989, the unit had sales of about $113
million, down from about $140 million only two years earlier,
Mr. Adcock said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He stressed, however, that "HRB remains a good solid
company," and that its sale is part of a larger Hadson
strategy to reduce debt and concentrate on producing and
supplying energy products and facilities, the primary
business of Oklahoma City-based Hadson.
   HRB will give E-Systems, a maker of defense electronics
systems, "access to new customers, emerging programs, and
synergistic opportunities which we expect will result in a
positive future contribution to our earnings," said E.G.
Keiffer, chairman and chief executive of E-Systems. He added
that HRB "will further complement and expand our position in
the advanced intelligence and reconnaissance systems
marketplace, an area which we believe has and will become
increasingly important." HRB, based in State College, Pa.,
employs about 1,300.
   Mr. Adcock said Hadson established reserves in the second
quarter large enough to cover the loss on the sale of HRB. Of
the $147 million, or $3.71-a-share, loss that Hadson reported
for the second quarter, about $144 million came from
discontinued operations. In the year-earlier quarter, the
company had a loss of $2.7 million, or seven cents a share,
after taking a $2.8 million loss on discontinued operations.
Revenue in the quarter fell to $106.5 million from $130.2
million.
   E-Systems reported six-month earnings of $35.9 million, or
$1.15 a share, compared with $38.5 million, or $1.24 a share,
a year earlier. Sales rose to $896 million from $791 million.

   Film: Phantomlike `Darkman' Seeks Revenge
   ----
   By Julie Salamon

<LP>
   "Darkman" doesn't have a crackerjack plot -- though it
does have five screenwriters. At times director Sam Raimi
constructs shots that are almost deliriously corny; for
example, standing his heroine in front of a background that
changes from a burning building to a cemetery as she glistens
in the foreground like a giant cutout doll. The
characterizations are undeniably melodramatic.
   Yet there is great giddy pleasure to be found in this
peppy Gothic thriller. Mr. Raimi got his start doing
low-budget horror films ("The Evil Dead" and its sequel), and
has carried the unbridled nuttiness of the genre to this more
mainstream picture. As, for instance, when Darkman forces an
adversary's head up through a manhole in the middle of a busy
street; the man bobs in traffic until he is flattened. Mr.
Raimi has shot this scene, and the entire movie, with a fluid
visual wit that sustains the mood through some implausible
turns in the story.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Indeed, "Darkman," an original film that seems very
familiar, has captured the moody romanticism of certain comic
book heroes without losing a sense of fun. Mr. Raimi hasn't
weighed the material down with the somber self-importance of
"Batman" or the pretty dullness of "Dick Tracy."
   Mr. Raimi is in top form with his villains, a great
assortment of geeks and brutes who can be bad in horrendously
imaginative ways. The main baddie specializes in guillotining
fingers with a cigar cutter, then collecting his trophies in
a velvet-lined box, as if it were Mother's best sterling.
   This scary fellow with the hard eyes, Durant, is one of
the movie's strangest surprises: He's played -- extremely
well -- by Larry Drake, best known as Benny, the mentally
retarded clerk on "L.A. Law" who periodically is trotted out
rather cynically to demonstrate that the show's careerist
characters really do have heart.
   "Darkman" begins life as Dr. Peyton Westlake, an earnest
research scientist on the verge of developing perfect
synthetic skin. He punches data into a computer and noses
float through the air -- then melt. He's also on the verge in
his personal life. He wants to get married to his girlfriend,
a perky lawyer named Julie. She says she loves him but she's
not quite ready to stick around either.
   Julie works for a real estate developer whose evil doings
become the catalyst for the creation of Darkman. The details
don't matter. It's enough to know that thugs blow up Peyton's
laboratory with him in it. Enough of him survives for him to
re-create himself as a character openly modeled on the
Phantom of the Opera, and to take his revenge.
   Irish actor Liam Neeson ("The Good Mother," "Suspect")
plays Peyton and the tortured Darkman as near to the top as
possible without going over, which seems entirely appropriate
for this operatic role. Mr. Neeson allows this creature, who
takes no pleasure in his revenge, dignity and poignancy that
don't seem cartoonish at all. Frances McDormand does what she
can with the relentlessly stalwart Julie, who is allowed one
amusing line: "If you're not going to kill me I have things
to do."

   The late Jim Thompson wrote 29 novels in the '50s. His
tough, pulpy literature was filled with neurotics, psychotics
and con men trying to paper over their nowhere lives with big
schemes. The schemes inevitably failed, and ended in violent
death.
   Movie makers have long been attracted to Thompson's gritty
vision, and he wrote a few screenplays himself. The tough
talk of Thompson's drifters and whacked-out dreamers can be
wonderful in the right hands. It also can seem oblique and
pretentious.
   An example of the oblique and pretentious Thompson
currently is available in director James Foley's new film,
"After Dark, My Sweet," based on a Thompson novel published
in 1955.
   Mr. Foley has done much to blur and sentimentalize this
story of a former boxing champ and mental patient who shows
up somewhere one day. Collie hooks up with a widowed dame
named Fay (Thompson's women inevitably are dames and more
than one is named Fay) and a con artist called Uncle Bud. He
sleeps with Fay and agrees to go along with Uncle Bud's plans
to kidnap a rich young boy.
   Like the plans of many Thompson character's, Uncle Bud's
isn't terribly well conceived, and even if it were, something
would happen to throw it off. Here, the little boy has
diabetes.
   There is inherent interest in the situation that Mr. Foley
manages to undercut with annoying soft-focus of thought and
camera. He encourages his actors to overdo everything, which
means a lot of neck-popping and eye-rolling on the part of
everyone. Pudgy Jason Patric, as Collie, has no edge at all,
while Rachel Ward's Fay is nothing but edges. She looks very
hungry. It's hard to know what Bruce Dern is doing as Uncle
Bud. Mr. Foley's attention seems to be occupied mainly with a
large table lamp in Fay's living room, the only object that
is framed nicely whenever it appears onscreen.
   ---
   "My Blue Heaven" is interesting as an example of how
talented or at least experienced people can spend a great
deal of time, money and effort on a movie that fails
consistently, in almost every single scene. The movie,
written by Nora Ephron and starring Steve Martin and Rick
Moranis, is billed as a comedy, though you will find yourself
wondering why Carol Kane appears briefly, and why she
disappears.
   ---
   The British director Nicolas Roeg has specialized over the
years in bizarre fantasies, sexual and otherwise, that rarely
made sense in any conventional way but that always were
fascinating to see. Now he's made his most coherent movie, a
nasty fairy tale called "Witches," in which Anjelica Huston
plays a vampy witch whose goal is to turn the children of
England into mice. It's a diabolical giggle, though parents
should know that in order for the little hero's kindly
grandmother to help him save the day, his parents must die.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: Jim Thompson's unblinking vision needed to be
put on screen by a director with a tough-minded intelligence
and a cool eye and a sense of humor. Stanley Kubrick has all
of them, and had them even as a young director, when he made
"The Killing" in 1956. Sterling Hayden is great, the
mastermind behind a racetrack heist. There is a dame named
Fay, too. And Thompson and Kubrick teamed up again for "Paths
of Glory," the first of Kubrick's cynical, powerful anti-war
pictures.

   Mohawk Crisis Closes Clementine's Kitchen

   Oka, Quebec -- Sometimes it's tough to get a reservation
in a good restaurant. When I telephoned L'Auberge Clementine
in this village just an hour's drive west of Montreal, the
answering machine said in French: "We're sorry we can't take
your call. We hope the crisis will be over soon."
   Clementine is a country inn famous for its fresh foie gras
from local ducks, for squab with mushrooms and wild rice,
pheasant breasts with cool sweet pepper sauce, quail with
wild garlic and apple brandy. Owner-chefs Michel and Louise
Beaulne have based their menu on the rich agricultural
resources of the surrounding region. But they currently are
unable to serve this sublimation of cuisine quebecoise
because their previously idyllic village has been under siege
for weeks over an issue of Indian land claims. Townspeople
have been caught in a confrontation between radical Mohawks
and the Quebec provincial police.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Until the Mohawks dug in at Oka -- after the municipality
threatened to expand the local golf course onto
Indian-claimed land -- it was just another pretty little
Quebec town just a couple of hours from Ottawa. If known at
all, it was for the restaurant and for a smooth cheese
similar to Port Salut that is made by Trappist monks who've
been there since 1788.
   This summer in Oka, a baleful standoff has been
maintained, the Mohawks entrenched behind their blockade at
the top of a hill on the town's main street, the police at
the bottom of the slope in scattered groups behind concrete
barriers. TV pictures have shown grim-faced government
ministers marching up the hill for a series of stalemated
talks, and journalists who have been allowed into the Indian
encampment have brought back reports of radical activists
from outside Oka, allegedly including some American Indians,
trained ex-Vietnam vets. They are heavily armed with
semiautomatic weapons, Uzis, even rocket launchers, and are
said to have taken control of the local group. No one except
local residents and those with special accreditation have
been allowed in or out of the town for weeks.
   Inside Oka, there is an eerie quality to its abandoned
streets with their well-kept houses, trimmed lawns and hedges
and colorful municipal flowerpots hanging from the lampposts.
Many residents have left to stay elsewhere. Down along the
water's edge, past the deserted beaches of the marina with
its grounded boats, is Clementine, a comfortable old
Quebec-style house overlooking Lac Deux Montagnes. Mrs.
Beaulne bursts from the door and hugs me, a welcome stranger
in the tense, hushed world that this town has become.
   Twenty yards from the front door a squad of police, some
with shotguns cradled in their arms, lounge under a brightly
striped marquee set up to protect them from the sun. Inside,
tables still are set for guests with pretty apricot
tablecloths, white lace overlays, copper salvers at each
place; the vases on each table still contain a few fresh
flowers. Around the warmly panelled room are hung antique
platters and old photographs, including one of a beautiful
young woman taken in 1898. It turns out to be Clementine,
Mrs. Beaulne's grandmother, who was, in her day, a celebrated
cook in Oka. Many of the restaurant's recipes, Mrs. Beaulne
explains, are based on Clementine's: traditional dishes of
Quebec, tourtiere, or meat pie, ragout des pattes de cochon,
a pig-foot stew, and for dessert, sugar pies made from maple
syrup. Over time, Mr. Beaulne has refined this heavy country
fare into the elaborate and delicious sounding plates now on
offer: oak leaf lettuce with smoked game meat, maple-flavored
quails from the region, carefully de-boned young saddle of
rabbit glazed with a honey and citrus sauce.
   As head of the local businessmen's group, Mr. Beaulne has
been in meetings all morning with a government minister
discussing compensation for local farmers and businessmen.
Unharvested raspberry crops lie rotting in the fields and
some farmers, Mr. Beaulne explains when he joins us, have
even been prevented from moving their cattle from one
pasturage to another. He himself is losing thousands of
dollars weekly, but thinks he'll be okay if things are
settled quickly. His neighbor at the marina and others in the
town aren't so secure. They have big mortgages. They rely on
the summer season to make money and many are close to
bankruptcy.
   The Beaulnes are disgusted with their government, both
provincial and federal. With political relations between
Quebec and Canada at an all time low this summer after the
collapse of the Meech Lake accord -- which was supposed to
declare Quebec a "distinct society" within Canada -- neither
authority has moved to help Oka.
   Mrs. Beaulne, who doubles as the pastry chef and hostess
for Clementine, slips away and returns with coffee and a
promised "light" dessert she has prepared. It's a fluffy
floating island in a rosehued pool of fresh raspberry coulis
set off by a single nasturtium. The talk turns to food and
how the Beaulnes discovered, almost by accident, the bounty
from the farms around Oka. "One day I was out of pheasant and
my supplier from Montreal was late," Mr. Beaulne says. "Then
I discovered the guy up the road was raising pheasant and I
could buy them for half the price." Not only was it "fabulous
for freshness," he goes on, but "I started to buy locally for
the money. I could offer a pheasant breast with cranberries
for six bucks less than my competitor]"
   Soon he had organized the local farms into a small company
that supplied him, and later local groceries and
supermarkets, with everything from lettuce to cheeses as well
as hormone-free ducks and chickens and delicious Quebec beef,
which previously had been shipped to Western Canada as cattle
for fattening and for the stamp that declared it western
beef. "I really went overboard with local produce," he says
now, recalling how he got one village market gardener to
switch her entire crop from vegetables to raspberries.
   As we talk, Mr. Beaulne absently waves away a garbage
truck that has backed into the driveway. No garbage today.
   Soon it is time to go, and back outside we reenter a war
zone. A short stroll around the corner from the restaurant we
stand at the base of the disputed hill. At the top we can
glimpse the dark, masked figures of the Mohawk guards
standing beneath the lazily flapping flag of the Mohawk
nation. When I move to step beyond the curb and the yellow
plastic police line, a Quebec policeman waves me back.
   "This," says Mr. Beaulne, "must be what it feels like to
live in Lebanon." He stands with his arm around his wife on
the front steps of the empty restaurant, and as I turn to
leave I wonder when I will be able to return for the simple
pleasures of a meal at L'Auberge Clementine.

   Ed.: Since Ms. Jennings's visit to Oka earlier this month,
the Quebec government has called in 3,000 Canadian soldiers
with tanks and armored personnel carriers. They now are in
position around Oka and the other disputed locations. On
Tuesday the army was given orders to take down the
barricades. Frantic last-minute negotiations now are under
way to settle matters peacefully. As of last night, the
barricades at Oka still stood, although a barricade blocking
a major commuter bridge into Montreal was dismantled withput
violence yesterday.

   Program Traders Move Off Exchanges
   ---
   `Collared' Investors
   Sidestep New Curbs

   NEW YORK -- At the big U.S. stock and futures exchanges,
program traders have been "collared" and detoured into
"sidecars" in an effort to get them to "stabilize." To all
this, many program-trading investors are saying "goodbye."
   New exchange limits on stock-index arbitrage, the most
controversial form of program trading, have made the strategy
riskier and harder to execute when markets are moving sharply
higher or lower. So Wall Street's program traders are simply
doing more and more arbitrage-related trades off exchanges.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Program trading, the simultaneous buying or selling of
hundreds of stocks, still averages about 10% of average daily
New York Stock Exchange volume. That reflects the need of
some big investors to trade large baskets of stocks in
strategies not related to index arbitrage. Also, many big
brokers such as Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. have stepped up index
arbitrage trading for the house account, making up for volume
that may have been lost from money managers.
   Advocates of program trading curbs say they help calm
panicky markets. At the same time, however, exchange
officials want the majority of trades to stay on exchanges
because, they say, it results in better pricing for all
investors.
   Program trading curbs indeed slow the abrupt advances and
declines in stock prices that this strategy, unhindered, can
exacerbate -- as demonstrated on several occasions this
month. But the volatility is reduced at the cost of market
efficiency, which means investors being able to buy or sell
easily at the best price.
   Under Rule 80A, the New York Stock Exchange mandates that
stock-index arbitrage, in which computer-assisted traders
rapidly buy or sell stocks in New York with offsetting trades
in stock futures in Chicago, must be conducted in a
technically stabilizing way once the Dow Jones Industrial
Average swings 50 points up or down from the previous day's
close. This "collar" introduces enough risk into the standard
stock-index arbitrage trade that use of the strategy almost
dries up, traders say.
   At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index futures, commonly used in stock-index
arbitrage, aren't allowed to fall more than 12 points for a
half-hour. Such a move also kicks in the Big Board's
"sidecar" procedure that routes all program trading orders to
a holding file. This "coordinated circuit breaker" tends to
block most stock-index arbitrage activity, traders say.
   Since last October's stock market "minicrash," program
traders have faced negative public opinion. The outcry was so
great that the Big Board commissioned a special panel on
volatility and investor confidence to deal with the question.
   But since last October, brokers and the big index funds
have been expecting tighter regulation. To duck the heat of
critics and sidestep regulatory blockades, they are trading
away from formal exchanges and even electronic networks, in a
completely private market run by big brokers and banks.
   "There is no question that you see a proliferation of
arbitrage-like trades in a private market because of a lack
of liquidity on exchanges imposed by program trading
collars," says Loyd Johnson, vice president at Advanced
Investment Management, a Pittsburgh investment firm.
   "Last Thursday, we had no buyers at all in the S&amp;P futures
and that was the result of the collars," he adds. (On
Thursday, program trading restrictions took effect at the Big
Board at 9:54 a.m. EDT and remained in effect all day.)
   "Ordinarily, brokerage firms {conducting arbitrage} would
be buying futures and selling stocks," Mr. Johnson says. "But
now nobody in their right mind would take that kind of risk.
Why fool around with this liquidity problem in the listed
market when I can lock a trade up" in the over-the-counter
market? he asks.
   It's difficult to measure the volume of off-exchange stock
index-related trades because regulators are having trouble
monitoring the transactions. "I do not believe that we have a
ready source who would tell us what the aggregate level of
equity-related swaps are," says Brandon Becker, associate
director of market regulation at the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   But investors who use these strategies say the trades have
ballooned since last October. Big brokers and banks such as
Salomon Brothers, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Bankers Trust Co.
are aggressively marketing the trades, fund managers say.
Investment firms say the corporations they manage money for
are even getting visits from brokers eager to sell new
private market techniques.
   Officials from Salomon Brothers, Bankers Trust Co. and
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. declined to comment formally.
   The rise in off-exchange stock-index trading strategies is
a textbook example of how Wall Street easily innovates around
restrictions. Also, it shows how "enhanced" stock index
funds, which promise to deliver better returns than the
market, must adopt new strategies to meet more competitive
performance demands. "There is a tremendous demand for
customized derivative products," says one Bankers Trust
official.
   Typically, the off-exchange transactions involve hundreds
of millions of dollars in stock positions, with some
involving $1 billion or more. The term of the swap agreements
can last several months or years.
   Index fund managers say the trades have lower commissions,
none of the risk involved in juggling futures and stock
positions, and much cheaper administrative costs. All these
savings help boost returns.
   "The over-the-counter market is wonderful because you can
define a strategy any way you want," says J. Thomas Allen,
president of Advanced Investment Management.
   One simple and popular strategy is swapping the return on
S&amp;P 500 over a specified time period for an interest rate
return, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate, for
example.
   The index fund can speculate by buying a security, such as
commercial paper or even a junk bond, that delivers a higher
return than Libor; so at the end of the year, the fund shows
clients that it earned the S&amp;P return plus added returns from
its interest rate bet.
   Brokers can speculate by deciding to hedge or not to hedge
the commitment the firm made to deliver the S&amp;P's return.
   These transactions are simple swaps with both sides
betting that they can do better than the commitment they've
promised to deliver.
   Often, the swaps give brokers a desired "short" position
in stocks that offsets their day-to-day purchases of stocks
from customers.
   The swaps are also being conducted using foreign
stock-market indexes, such as the DAX index of major West
German stocks. Some of these markets don't have related
futures contracts, so the brokers are, in effect, creating
them with swap agreements.
   As the transactions proliferate and become more
innovative, some investors are starting to voice concerns
about credit risk. "There is a whole chain link: Does the
broker fail on his end, or does the investment manager fail
on his promise?" says Jeffrey Geller, managing director at
BEA Associates. Ordinarily, investors and brokers put up with
credit risk for a day or two as trades settle. But swap
transactions are often long-term bets, making credit-quality
concerns all the more intense.
   "Credit risk is the biggest factor," says Al Slosky, chief
investment officer of MTH Asset Management. "It's market
changes that create defaults. What if you entered into a
three-year swap agreement with Drexel Burnham Lambert two
years ago?"

   Abreast of the Market:
   Industrials Gain 17.58 on Decline
   In Oil, Prospect of Mideast Solution

   NEW YORK -- Another steep decline in crude-oil prices and
heightened optimism about the prospects for a peaceful
resolution of the Mideast conflict sent stock prices higher,
but trading remained light.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 17.58 to 2632.43
amid reports pointing toward a more conciliatory position by
Iraq and news that most members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries had agreed to permit increased
oil production.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 972 to 508 on
the New York exchange. Among broader market indexes, Standard
&amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index gained 2.85 to 324.19, the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 1.52 to 177.78 and the
Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 2.46 to 300.13.
   Big Board volume rose slightly, to 134,240,000 shares from
127,650,000 Tuesday, but the total reflected several large
block trades that appeared to be designed to capture
quarterly dividend payments.
   Also, traders noted that buying and selling resulting from
stock-index arbitrage contributed to the market's volatility,
as arbitrage buying surfaced just after midday and some
arbitrage selling cut into the market's gains late in the
session.
   Based on yesterday's closing price levels, the stage may
be set for further index-arbitrage selling as trading opens
today. September contracts on the S&amp;P 500 finished at 323.85,
a discount of nearly 1/2 point to the cash index.
   In recent days, "fair value" for the S&amp;P 500 contract -- a
price level that reflects the different costs and benefits of
owning futures as opposed to stocks -- has been about one
point above the cash index, according to a trader at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   Stocks spent the first half of the latest session drifting
within narrow trading ranges, duplicating their performance
Tuesday when the Dow Jones industrials eked out a 3.22-point
gain.
   However, as crude-oil prices tumbled below $26 a barrel in
New York trading, "oil started to dictate where {stocks} were
going," said Jeffrey Kaminsky, head of block trading at
Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co.
   The October futures contract for light crude oil retreated
$1.96 a barrel, to $25.92, amid expectations that OPEC's
accord would resolve the shortfall in oil output stemming
from the Mideast crisis.
   Separately, Iraq reportedly offered to withdraw from
Kuwait and release all foreign hostages if certain conditions
were satisfied -- a proposal coming the day before a meeting
between United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz.
   However, the market's late pullback reflected some renewed
concerns that the Middle East situation could deteriorate.
And the White House denied that it has received any direct
offer from Baghdad.
   "That fear is still overhanging the market, even though
the picture is improving a little bit as far as oil prices
and the overall status" of the Mideast situation are
concerned, said Joseph J. McAlinden, director of research at
Dillon, Read &amp; Co.
   Food, beverage and drug issues were among the session's
best performers as market players continued to steer toward
groups whose earnings are considered least likely to falter
in a weak economy.
   Philip Morris added 1/2 to 45 1/2 in composite trading of
2.6 million shares, while Coca-Cola gained 1 to 42 3/4,
Hershey Foods climbed 1 7/8 to 37 1/2 and Merck rose 1 1/8 to
82.
   Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 1 3/8 to 60 3/4 on 1.2 million
shares amid word that the Food and Drug Administration had
set Oct. 16 as the date for an advisory committee to conduct
a review of Pravachol, the company's cholesterol drug. The
news prompted analysts at Goldman Sachs and Cowen &amp; Co. to
repeat their buy recommendations, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.
   Three of the Big Board's most active issues were among
apparent targets of dividend-capture trades by institutions:
Texas Utilities, which dipped 1/8 to 33 7/8 on volume of 3.9
million shares; First Interstate Bancorp, which added 1/4 to
28 7/8 on 3.5 million shares; and First Bank System, which
lost 1/4 to 12 3/4 on 2.1 million shares.
   U.S. Shoe dropped 3/4 to 13 3/8. The company reported that
net income for the fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 4 fell
29% from a year earlier.
   Perkin-Elmer gained 1 3/8 to 22 7/8. In reporting that
earnings for the fiscal quarter ended in July were up 3% from
a year ago, the company pointed to "operational improvements"
growing out of a recent restructuring, such as stronger cash
flow and "accelerating order growth" for new instrument
products.
   Anthem Electronics plunged 3 3/8 to 21 1/2. Smith Barney,
Harris Upham lowered the stock's investment rating to hold
from buy and reduced its 1990 and 1991 earnings projections.
Analyst James L. Barlage told the Dow Jones investor report
that he has turned cautious on the company's shortterm
prospects as a result of continuing "spotty order patterns"
in its third quarter and the possibility of a U.S. recession
ahead.
   Kansas Gas &amp; Electric rose 3/4 to 25 1/2. The company,
targeted in a $27-a-share takeover offer from Kansas City
Power &amp; Light, disclosed that it may hold discussions about
its possible merger or reorganization, among other things.
Kansas City P&amp;L went up 1/8 to 29 3/4 on one million shares,
with dividend-related trades accounting for most of the
activity.
   Beazer added 3/8 to 10 3/8. The company agreed to sell a
50% stake in its Midlothian, Texas, cement manufacturing
plant for about $45 million to a U.S. unit of Pioneer
International, another British-based firm.
   Talley Industries, which said it stands to benefit from
General Motors' decision to boost the number of U.S.-built
cars equipped with air bags, rose 1 to 6 5/8. Under a 12-year
royalty agreement with TRW, which acquired the company's
airbag business in April 1989, Talley receives payments for
every bag sold in North America by any manufacturer and for
every bag sold by TRW world-wide.
   Stanley Works added 3/4 to 30 3/8. The company's board
approved the repurchase of as many as three million common
shares and raised its quarterly dividend 11% to 30 cents a
share.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 2.45
to 324.23. Volume totaled 11,670,000 shares.

   GOOD NEWS FOR FRENCH BUSINESS

   To help counteract the negative economic effects of the
Mideast crisis, France's government is preparing some
unexpected good news for businessmen and consumers: Lower
taxes next year.
   Officials said they also are planning deeper than expected
cuts in government spending next year, in an effort to
curtail the expected inflationary effects of higher oil
prices. The plans are part of the preparation of the 1991
budget, which will be presented to Parliament in the fall.
   The planned cuts in business taxes are likely to anger
many Socialist members of Parliament, who generally support
the government but consider Socialist Prime Minister Michel
Rocard too pro-business. The cuts likely also will be
criticized by the right-wing opposition, which generally
considers the Socialist government's tax and spending cuts
too small.
   Under the plan, taxes on reinvested business profits are
to be cut to 34%, from 37% currently. An earlier plan called
for them to fall no lower than 35%.
                                                                                                       

   ALBANIAN DENIAL
                                                                                                       

   Albania denied it is building a wall around foreign
embassies in its capital, Tirana, in order to restrict access
to them. The official ATA news agency said that "at the
request of some embassies themselves some adjustments of the
walls and their lattices are being made." It didn't name the
embassies. About 5,000 Albanians climbed over embassy walls
last month to gain access to foreign missions in a bid to
emigrate. They eventually were allowed to leave Albania.

   BHOPAL ARGUMENTS END
                                                                                                       

   India's Supreme Court finished hearing arguments yesterday
on overturning last year's $470 million settlement between
the government and Union Carbide Corp. for the 1984 Bhopal
gas disaster. The five-judge panel reserved judgment on the
case, United News of India reported. No date was set for
pronouncement. The settlement between the government of
previous Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and the U.S. company was
ordered by the Supreme Court in February 1989 during the
hearing of a $3 billion suit filed against Union Carbide.
Victims' groups and the current government appealed against
the settlement earlier this year, saying it was too meager.

weapon of terrorists. Prague's daily Mlada Fronta said
trained German shepherd dogs can find the plastic explosive
hidden in a building, car, luggage or on a person. Training
the dogs to sniff out Semtex takes three months, the
Communist Party paper Rude Pravo reported.
                                                                                                       

   EUROPE'S IMPERILED FORESTS
                                                                                                       

   Air pollution is taking a toll on Europe's forests, the
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe reported. The
survey covered 286 million acres in 26 nations, representing
two-thirds of Europe's forest area. Spruce, fir and oak trees
over 60 years old were the worst hit. Over 15% of all spruces
in this age group in 15 countries were suffering moderate to
severe defoliation, as were the same percentage of oaks in 15
countries and of firs in seven countries, the report said.
                                                                                                       

   NEW HOTEL FOR BEIJING
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Sapporo Breweries Ltd. and partners will open a
hotel in Beijing to coincide with the Asian Games to be held
in the Chinese capital in September, a company spokesman
said. The first eight floors of the 13-story Beijing Rainbow
Hotel will be opened to guests from Sept. 17, the spokesman
said. Sapporo has a 60% stake in the hotel, Beijing Tourism
Corp. has a 35% stake, and the remainder is owned by the
Japanese trading house Tokyo Maruichi Shoji Co.
                                                                                                       

   EAST GERMAN SPORT STRUGGLE
                                                                                                       

   East Germany's training system for swimmers, the most
successful in the world, is close to going under, an official
of the sport's federation said.
   After years of close attention and lavish financing,
swimmers face mounting problems in training, medical care and
other areas because money has dried up. "The most successful
swimming country is disappearing," a federation official
lamented. "People are going to other jobs or abroad, years of
experience is just flowing away."
   The official said "considerable parts of our swimming
structure are already broken," including the system for
selecting youngsters, cultivating them in training centers
and allocating clubs. "The structures are cracking right down
to sports medical care," he said.
   West Germany's swimming federation has agreed to merge
with its East German counterpart. That decision sparked
protests among West German swimmers who fear they will lose
their places on the team to more powerful competitors.

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's new press spokesman
promised at his first news conference yesterday to play no
favorites with the official Soviet media or Western
journalists. Vitaly Ignatenko said: "We will have equal
relations with all journalists. We will not be hiding, we
will be open." . . . Bermuda voters elected to retain the
death penalty. Nearly 11,000 people turned out to vote in the
island's first national referendum, and almost 79% voted to
retain capital punishment for premeditated murder.

   Evil Comes to Wappingers
   ----

<LP>
   On Nov. 28, 1987, a 15-year-old black girl, whose
stepfather had stabbed his first wife 14 times in 1969 as a
dress rehearsal for killing her with four bullet holes to the
head in 1970, was seen crawling into a plastic garbage bag
outside the Pavillion Condominiums near Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
The girl's clothing had been singed by fire, she was covered
in dog excrement, and the words "KKK" and "nigger" had been
scrawled onto her body. It was not the sort of thing that
happened in Wappingers Falls, N.Y., every day.
   It is the premise of "Outrage: The Story Behind the Tawana
Brawley Hoax" (Bantam, 408 pages, $21.95) that Tawana Brawley
was so fearful of returning to her stepfather's house, from
which she had been absent four days, that she and her mother,
Glenda, cooked up an elaborate story about rape and abduction
at the hands of white policemen and Ku Klux Klan members to
prevent Ralph King from punishing her for visiting a
boyfriend serving time in a nearby prison. As a result of
this hoax, various innocent people had their reputations
besmirched, well-meaning celebrities such as Bill Cosby and
Mike Tyson were duped, and the black people of America,
already victimized by poverty, crime and an enduring racism,
were sucker-punched by a clan of ne'er-do-well pranksters and
their publicity-mongering advisers. All the same, it's worth
remembering that 15-year-old girls often will dream up wild
tales, particularly if they happen to have a stepfather who
stabbed his first wife 14 times before dropping by a year
later to polish her off for good.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Outrage" is the work of six New York Times reporters
(Robert D. McFadden, Ralph Blumenthal, M.A. Farber, E.R.
Shipp, Charles Strum and Craig Wolff), some of whom covered
the case, some of whom rewrote the stories filed by those who
covered the case. It is, as one would expect of a Times
undertaking, very well-researched and very well-written, and
it is, as one would expect of a Times undertaking, more than
vaguely self-congratulatory. The Times reporters chide their
downscale upstate journalistic colleagues for their lack of
zeal in pursuing the story, and also take potshots at their
less gifted competitors in the broadcast news community.
Piling on the inside baseball about the workings of a
big-city newspaper, the sextet recount how they, the pros
from the Big Apple, busted this story wide open, leaving no
doubt that Tawana and Glenda Brawley had cooked up this
farcical tale, which was then played for all it was worth by
the Brooklyn-based James Brown impersonator and erstwhile FBI
informant the Rev. Al Sharpton and two lawyers, the
politically ambitious C. Vernon Mason and the implacable
Alton Maddox.
   The self-congratulatory tone is more than a trifle
grating, as the Times reporters were privy to all sorts of
hot tips and official leaks to which journeymen at papers
such as the Poughkeepsie Journal were not. But, more to the
point, the Times reporters hardly were cracking the crime of
the century. From very early on, it was clear that something
smelled about this story, and it wasn't just dog feces. Ms.
Brawley claimed to have been forcibly abducted and held
captive for four days, but there was never any evidence of
physical harm. She claimed to have been sexually violated but
there never was any evidence of rape. An abundance of
medical, psychological and circumstantial evidence gradually
made it clear that Ms. Brawley, whatever her reasons, was
lying. Long before the New York Times had laid the case to
rest, an awful lot of its readers already had the general
idea.
   Not that everyone thinks the case has been laid to rest.
What is most disturbing about Ms. Brawley's ludicrous yarn is
that it was believed, and continues to be believed, by more
than a tiny number of black Americans. Why? Why not? As the
authors of "Outrage" point out, black New Yorkers had grown
weary of official investigations that inevitably sided with
white police officers compelled to strangle unusually
athletic graffiti artists or gun down knife-wielding
grandmas. The mood of credulity was further abetted by the
notorious Howard Beach case, in which a terrified young black
man was hounded to his death on a Brooklyn highway late in
1986.
   "Outrage" does an admirable, evenhanded job with all this,
even explaining the motivation for Mr. Maddox's all-consuming
hatred of whites (he was savagely beaten by a white gang
while growing up in Georgia). But the book hardly is
sympathetic toward this pack of manipulative liars. Mr.
Maddox, who accused New York State Attorney General Robert
Abrams of masturbating while looking at Tawana Brawley's
photograph, comes off as a racist madman. Glenda Brawley
comes off as a media-teasing charlatan. Mr. Sharpton, who
even accused the Mafia and the Irish Republican Army of
participating in Ms. Brawley's degradation, comes off as an
amiable stooge. Ralph King comes off as a stepfather no girl
would want to mess with. Tawana comes off as Tawana.
   The authors have an eye for the telling detail: Glenda
Brawley doing her aerobics exercises on the roof of a Queens
church where she was hiding out from the government;
then-heavyweight champion Mike Tyson giving Tawana his
$36,000 Rolex watch; Gov. Mario Cuomo phoning a black radio
station in New York and confronting his adversaries on the
air. Yet the most memorable image is that of Tawana Brawley
and her entourage turning up in Atlanta to lay a wreath at
Martin Luther King's final resting place. Until then, Ms.
Brawley merely had been guilty of lying. Now she was guilty
of defiling a grave.

   CBS Appoints
   Rodgers to Head
   TV Stations Unit

   NEW YORK -- Johnathan Rodgers was named president of the
five television stations owned by CBS Inc., inheriting a
division with a decidedly uneven performance.
   Mr. Rodgers, 44 years old, will guide the division from
Chicago, where he served as general manager of CBS-owned
WBBM. As expected, he was chosen to succeed Eric Ober, who
was named president of CBS News last week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The CBS-owned TV stations in New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago and Philadelphia have a combined cash flow of about
$170 million. Its Miami station, WCIX, is losing several
million dollars a year and has signal problems.
   "CBS stations are laggard but extremely profitable," said
John Kornreich, analyst with Sandler Capital Management.
"They could be even more profitable and contribute more
heavily to CBS's bottom line, but they have to better deliver
the audience share."
   CBS has major headaches at KCBS in Los Angeles, where Mr.
Rodgers once served as news director and station manager.
Among the three network-owned stations in the city, KCBS
ranks a poor third, especially during the early-evening
newscast. (Local news programs provide stations with most of
their revenue.)
   WBBM in Chicago is a strong No. 2, though it finishes a
distant third during the late local news. That probably
results, however, from the CBS network's weak prime-time
schedule delivering a small audience -- a problem plaguing
CBS stations and affiliates all over the country. Although
WCAU in Philadelphia is ranked No. 2 from sign-on to
sign-off, most of its local newscasts are rated lower. WCBS
in New York has solidly improved, although it's still a
distant No. 2 to powerhouse WABC, owned by Capital Cities/ABC
Inc.
   "Certainly the stations group is not in great shape," said
Richard A. Kurlander, vice president and director of
programming at Petry Television Inc., a firm that advises TV
stations. "CBS rarely brings in people from the outside, so
it gets too inbred. But Rodgers is an excellent manager who I
expect will do a good job."
   Mr. Rodgers is an easygoing, affable executive who joined
WBBM in 1986 after serving as an executive at CBS News. He is
known for a demanding yet relaxed management style. For
example, he implements a strict "dress down" Friday policy;
that is, he encourages wearing blue jeans to the office.
   Mr. Rodgers said in an interview that he believes his role
is to "allow general managers to get their own job done" and
to allow the stations to operate independently. The most
important job for the CBS stations is "program acquisitions,"
he said. Because stations can no longer win 40% audience
ratings, he said, "we have to go after programs that will get
not only a 20 share but the right 20 share, meaning the right
demographics."
   With the exception of KCBS in Los Angeles, the CBS-owned
stations made several major purchases of syndicated product
for the 1990-91 TV season, which begins next month.
   WCBS, for instance, bought "Entertainment Tonight,"
syndicated by Paramount Communications Corp. And the four
stations purchased "Trump Card," syndicated by Warner Bros.
Television, a division of Time Warner Inc.

   FAIRFIELD, N.J. -- Ogden Martin Systems Inc. said it
received approval from Lee County officials in Florida to
build and operate a $147 million waste-to-energy facility.
   It will be the fourth such facility in Florida to be built
by the unit of Ogden Projects Inc. The award is significant
because Florida is one of the states where the solid-waste
disposal crisis is acute and where incineration, much opposed
by the public, is trying to get a toehold.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The facility will convert up to 657,000 tons of
residential and commercial solid waste annually into more
than 47 megawatts of electric power. Ogden will sell the
power to Florida Power &amp; Light Corp. The county will receive
90% of the revenue from electric sales, which will be used to
pay down the cost of financing and operating the plant.
   The facility will be financed by revenue bonds that the
county, as owner, will issue by year end. Construction of the
plant, which will take 27 months, will begin when all
applicable federal, state and local environmental permits are
issued.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Ogden shares closed at $19, up 12.5 cents.

   LAKEWOOD, Colo. -- Plains Petroleum Co. said it reached an
agreement with KN Energy Inc., the purchaser of about 85% of
its natural gas production, for wellhead prices to be charged
under base contracts for 1991.
   With this new agreement, Plains estimates that 1991 gas
volumes sold will increase by about 17.5% and that revenue
received from its principal purchaser will increase 12.5%
from its current 1990 forecast of about $33 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Plains said the annually renegotiated price will vary for
1991 from a high of $1.95 per million British thermal units
for sales made in the high-demand season in the winter and
late fall to $1.65 per million BTUs in the low-demand season.
Assuming normal weather, the expected average price for 1991
for the base contracts is $1.8 million BTUs, or about 2% less
than the current-year price of $1.84 million BTUs.
   Plains Petroleum is an oil and gas company. KN Energy,
also based in Lakewood, Colo., is a diversified energy
company.

   Kidder Regains Program Trading Crown

   NEW YORK -- Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. reclaimed its rank of
No. 1 program trader on the New York Stock Exchange.
   While some other brokerage firms continue to shy away from
computer-aided program strategies, Kidder has used advanced
technology to overtake Morgan Stanley Group Inc. as the most
active program-trading firm, averaging 13.6 million shares
traded weekly since early July. Most striking, Kidder now
accounts for one-third of all stock-index arbitrage activity,
the most disputed form of program trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While program traders don't agree on this, critics have
blamed index arbitrage for exacerbating big market plunges,
including the 1987 stock market crash and last October's
190-point minicrash.
   Executives and traders at Kidder argue that their program
trading -- most of it for the firm's own account, rather than
for customers -- is being done responsibly, in ways that
don't disrupt the markets. And the firm needs the profits,
after posting a net loss of $23 million last year.
   But the stepped-up program activity could cause public
relations problems for Kidder and its parent, General
Electric Co. Kidder is still smarting from the angry letters
and phone calls, including some from of its own brokers, that
helped spur the firm to cut back its program activity last
October.
   In Fairfield, Conn., GE declined to comment yesterday on
its Kidder unit's program activities.
   In stock-index arbitrage, traders make rapid-fire
purchases and sales of long lists of stocks with offsetting
trades in stock-index futures, profiting by slight price
discrepancies between the two markets.
   Rival traders and market analysts have been surprised by
the amount of Kidder's trading, because in recent weeks, it
has been difficult to gauge the discrepancies, or spread,
between the markets.
   Kurt Schultz, senior stock-index analyst for Refco Group
Ltd. in Chicago, said index arbitrage has "been real
sporadic, and it's been jittery, which can be a problem for
these guys. You have all these kneejerk reactions out of the
Middle East. The futures and {stocks} get out of line, but
it's tough" to do index arbitrage, "because everyone's trying
to go the same way."
   Such problems haven't stopped Kidder.
   "They are aggressive," Jeremy Lefkowitz, managing director
at Chancellor Capital Management in New York, said. "They are
executing when other people are waiting" for more obvious
opportunities.
   For example, Big Board statistics show that during the
first half-hour of trading on Aug. 3, when the stock market
plunged 57.70 points, Kidder was the most active program
trader among firms that were trading both for their own
accounts and customers -- selling 633,000 shares for its own
account and 387,000 as an agent for customers.
   Kidder had been one of several major brokerage firms that
stopped doing stock-index arbitrage for their own accounts.
But Kidder jumped back into the activity three months ago, a
few months after a similar resumption by Bear Stearns Cos.
The two biggest U.S. brokerage firms, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and
American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said
they have discontinued all index arbitrage.
   When Kidder resumed stock-index arbitrage for its own
account, the firm pledged that it would at all times -- even
before so-called circuit breakers to help slow down big
market swings are triggered -- sell stocks only on "upticks,"
when a stock is rising, and buy only on "downticks." This
approach is meant to avoid accelerating a market move already
under way.
   Many index-fund managers said the limits make it
impossible to do index arbitrage effectively.
   So how can Kidder trade with self-imposed restrictions and
still make money? People familiar with Kidder said the
in-house program trading unit, under the direction of Peter
Klein, senior vice president, is taking advantage of
sophisticated computer software it has developed over the
past few years. The computer programs are a closely guarded
secret within the firm and haven't been shown to customers.
"Peter got the mandate to develop good analytics," said an
individual familiar with the operation.
   Another system, developed for customers with the help of
GE researchers, is programmed to monitor the buying and
selling prices of "program stocks" -- those issues that are
part of stock indexes such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index -- and how much stock is offered for sale or purchased
at a given time, or what traders call liquidity.
   It isn't surprising that Kidder has been doing so much
trading for its own account; for example, 7.1 million shares,
compared with 5.3 million for customers, in the most recent
week for which data has been released by the Big Board. The
customer-oriented part of Kidder's program trading unit has
experienced some personnel tumult. Joseph R. Schmuckler, head
of the customer unit, has left to join Nomura Securities
International, a unit of Nomura Securities Co. Steve
Bodurtha, a top analyst at Kidder who worked on trading
ideas, left to join Merrill Lynch.

   Saturday, Sept. 1, 10:30-11 p.m. EDT, on NBC: "AFI
Presents TV or Not TV?" an American Film Institute special
hosted by Jack Lemmon and featuring skits developed at the
AFI summer workshop. The program is the work, in short, of
aspiring comedy writers, normally a prospect to make the
blood run cold. This would be no exception but for one
laceratingly clever sketch called "Cooking With God" that
makes the whole enterprise, complete with sendups of Roseanne
Barr and "Twin Peaks," seem worth enduring. "Cooking With
God" is four minutes of wildly inspired nastiness aimed at
money-hustling television ministries. Harry Shearer stars as
the Rev. Robert Tilton, author of "The Robert Tilton Blind
Faith Cookbook," which among other things implores us to
"Accept the Lord as your personal chef."
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, Sept. 9, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on HBO: "Somebody Has to
Shoot the Picture," a compelling and oddly stylish film
notwithstanding the ungainly title. Roy Scheider is at his
lachrymose best as the photographer hero drawn into the
(fictional) case of a death-row inmate facing imminent
execution despite substantial questions about his guilt. Both
a murder mystery and a raw closeup of the business of
execution, the film is unmistakably a brief against the death
penalty, but one that fortunately avoids the usual
sermonizing.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, Sept. 10, 8-10 p.m. EDT, on TNT: "The Lost
Capone." You probably didn't know Al Capone had a nice
younger brother. Well apparently he did, and TNT has
unearthed him for us, via the work of newspaper columnist
James Bacon, on whose research this quasi-biographical saga
is based. Young Jimmy Capone, it appears, shared none of the
family predilection for violence, which outraged his
soon-to-become-famous brother Al the mobster and his barber
father who was sympathetic to mobs. Young Jimmy lit out for
new territory, where, to his elderly parent's further
mortification, he became a law officer. The relatives cannot
hold their heads up for shame. Clearly this is a crime-family
version of "The Jazz Singer," wherein this youth breaks his
old father's heart by running off to become a good citizen
instead of a singer. Under the alias Richard ("Two Gun")
Hart, the wayward Capone becomes the scourge of bootleggers
out West, among them, needless to say, Brother Al. The
producers note that some aspects of this history have been
fictionalized, which is also needless to say. Eric Roberts is
a credible Al Capone, despite an Italian accent that
regularly veers off into something a lot more like a cross
between Navajo and Romanian. Nevertheless, all this is
enormously entertaining, with a noteworthy performance from
actor Titus Welliver, who extracts more from the role of
middle brother Ralph Capone than one would have thought
possible.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Sept. 12, 8-9 p.m., on CBS: "Are You Safe? A
National Test on Crime Prevention." Kevin Dobson is the host
of this grimly practical compendium of pointers on ways to
avoid becoming a crime victim. It makes use, to be sure, of
test gimmickry, with answers and points scored, but there is
nothing relaxing or gamelike about this hour, which is
chillingly evocative in its portraits of the criminal
endeavor. Nothing gets one's attention more than the sight of
criminals about to pounce, and that sight, in all its hideous
variety, from street muggings to burglary to worse (all
reenactments), is what ensures that no one will fall asleep
watching this. It also is the reason a good many citizens
watching it are likely to want to go out and get a gun,
though this clearly is not the response intended by the
producers. The program underlines and amplifies the
well-justified sense now haunting everyone's life, that crime
and danger are just around the corner, waiting to strike.
This hour is, to repeat, no barrel of laughs, but it is hard
to imagine any television program that comes closer to
peoples' real concerns than these sometimes predictable,
sometimes surprising instructions on ways to stay alive.
Watch.
                                                                                                       

   Wednesday, Sept. 12, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on A&amp;E: "The 1960
National Democratic Convention." The hit of the year was
"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini," which did
not augur well for the new decade. The 1960 Democratic
Convention, which resulted in the nomination of John F.
Kennedy, brings back a lot more of the flavor of the time. It
was one of the last conventions that could still lay claim to
the appearance of a contest, as opposed to the ceremonial
annointments of today. John Chancellor narrates this
irresistible look back at a convention in which Kennedy's
competitors were, among others, Adlai Stevenson and Lyndon B.
Johnson.

   Seeks Flexibility
   On Debt Terms

   The Philippines, hard hit by an earthquake in July and the
current Mideast crisis, is seeking more-flexible arrangements
for repaying its $26.1 billion foreign debt.
   "There is now a greater need for debt relief," said Jose
Cuisia Jr., governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines.
"There should be greater flexibility."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Cuisia said in an interview, however, that the
administration of President Corazon Aquino will resist calls
for a moratorium on foreign-debt payments. The Philippine
Congress has passed nonbinding resolutions asking the
president to negotiate a 30-month moratorium, but Mrs. Aquino
says she will veto any bill requiring a payment halt, which
could ruin the country's international credit rating and
hinder foreign trade and investment.
   A series of debt-rescheduling agreements has extended
repayment periods, but the country's debt burden remains
heavy. This year, for instance, payments will eat up 40% of
the national budget. One-third of those payments go to
foreign creditors.
   As an example of the flexibility he is seeking from
creditors, Mr. Cuisia said the Philippines wants to conduct
another buy-back of commercial-bank debt this year, similar
to the $1.31 billion buy-back completed in January. To do so,
the government will need permission of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank to use funds lent by those
institutions.
   Under a 1989 debt-restructuring agreement, commercial-bank
creditors have been given a choice of offering debt to the
government for repurchase or of subscribing to new 15-year
Philippine bonds. Earlier this year, the Philippines sold
more than $700 million of bonds to creditor banks, an amount
lower than the government had expected.
   Mr. Cuisia said another buy-back would be the "most
cost-effective" way for the country to reduce its debt
burden. Many foreign commercial banks also favor such action
as a way to remove Philippine debt from their books, even at
a discount. In the January buy-back, the government
repurchased bank debt at 52 cents for every $1 of existing
debt with funds from the IMF, World Bank and Japan's
Export-Import Bank.
   Mr. Cuisia said the amount of commercial-bank debt
tendered in the January buy-back exceeded the $1.31 billion
actually retired, and he suggested there is at least $500
million and probably $800 million to $1 billion more of debt
that could be retired through another buy-back at a similar
discount.
   New York-based Manufacturers Hanover Corp., the lead bank
of the Philippines' 12-bank creditor group, declined to
comment on Manila's desire for a second buy-back. But a
senior U.S. bank official said creditor banks would be likely
to participate in a second such arrangement.
   Whatever action is taken to reduce the country's total
debt and its payments burden, there is concern both in the
Philippines and among foreign bankers that the country may
need additional assistance. One reason is the earthquake that
struck northern Luzon on July 16, killing more than 1,600
people and causing some $800 million in damages.
   Another is the Mideast crisis, which is likely to take a
severe toll on the Philippines' balance-of-payments position,
especially if oil prices remain near $30 a barrel. The
country imports 65% of its energy needs, mostly in oil and
oil products. In addition, remittances from Philippine
workers in the Mideast are sure to decline.
   Before the earthquake and Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, the government estimated an overall
balance-of-payments deficit of $300 million for 1991. "It
almost certainly will be much higher than that," Mr. Cuisia
said, without providing a new estimate. In the first five
months of the year, the balance-of-payments deficit was $58
million.
   The Philippines will need new loans to help cover the
widening payments gap. Mr. Cuisia said the issue of new
lending was deferred during recent meetings with creditors
and will be taken up later this year.
   In the meantime, the National Economic Development Agency
has reduced its outlook for growth in gross national product
to 3.8% from 6.5% forecast at the beginning of the year.

   TOKYO -- Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan unveiled a
package of financial, logistical and medical contributions as
its part of the effort to enforce the sanctions against Iraq,
calling them "the utmost" the country can do under its
war-renouncing constitution.
   Japanese officials emphasized that this was the first time
Japan has taken part in a tense military confrontation in a
distant region since World War II. They pleaded for
international understanding of the country's inability to
send military forces or weapons.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But it's unclear what kind of reviews the package will get
abroad. The U.S., in particular, has been pressuring Japan
for a sizable contribution to the region. But many details of
the package remain to be worked out, and Foreign Ministry
spokesman Taizo Watanabe declined to put a price tag on it.
   Late Thursday morning in Tokyo, Mr. Watanabe said that
after an evening of strenuous internal negotiations, Japan
had decided to estimate the value of its logistical and
medical contributions at $1 billion but still didn't have any
total figure for its contributions to countries in the
region.
   Japanese press reports said Mr. Kaifu explained the
package to President Bush by telephone before unveiling it in
a televised news conference. The reports said Mr. Bush
expressed understanding but urged Japan to do more. Briefing
foreign reporters, Mr. Watanabe declined to confirm whether
the call had taken place.
   In Washington, Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department
spokeswoman, said the measures announced by Japan were
"useful initial steps in responding to the Persian Gulf
crisis." She made clear that the U.S. was hoping for further
actions. "We look forward to discussing with Japan the exact
details of what Japan will do, as we consider what further
steps and contributions might be necessary as the situation
in the Gulf evolves," she said.
   Under the package, Japan will help transport food, water
and medical supplies to the U.S.-led multinational forces in
the Persian Gulf area and dispatch a 100-person civilian
medical team. Japan will also give at least $10 million to
help evacuees from Kuwait and Iraq and will help the
economies of Turkey, Jordan and Egypt with an unspecified sum
of low-interest loans and grants.
   "It's difficult to say whether it's millions of dollars or
billions of dollars," Mr. Watanabe said of the loans and
grants.
   It's also difficult to estimate the price tag of the whole
package. The only figure mentioned in the government's
seven-paragraph press release is the $10 million. According
to an air-cargo industry source, a charter flight from Japan
to the Middle East would cost about $650,000 plus insurance.
But it's not clear how many flights will be covered under the
package.
   Bureaucrats crafted the measures to minimize domestic
controversy over the constitutionality of assisting a
military operation outside Japan. The country won't send any
members of its euphemistically named Self-Defense Forces. The
private Japanese ships and planes that the government will
charter won't carry any munitions or weaponry, a condition
insisted on by some unionized crews.
   But the government could come under fire domestically over
one provision of the package. In addition to chartering its
own ships and planes to carry food, water and medical
supplies, Japan will help pay for charters by other
countries. The foreign ships and planes chartered by these
Japanese payments may be used to transfer munitions and
weaponry.
   Mr. Kaifu, defending his package, said: "We cannot afford
to be seen not doing anything about a problem which threatens
our own national interests." He suggested that Japan adopt a
"United Nations Peace Cooperation Law" that would enable the
country to react more quickly in the future. But he didn't
say when, if at all, he might introduce such legislation, nor
what exactly it might stipulate.
   Some senior conservative politicians have called in recent
days for legislation that would allow Japan to dispatch its
Self-Defense Forces overseas. But Mr. Kaifu gave no sign of
supporting their call.
   While declining to give examples of the kind of equipment
Japan might supply, he said the country would give the U.S.
and other countries a list of all the equipment available in
Japan and pay for any of it they chose. After exhausting
Japan's supplies of such equipment, Japan would buy similar
items in other countries for use by the multinational forces.
   Mr. Watanabe said some American officials had been briefed
on this plan, "and the reaction was positive."
   Japanese officials hope to work out the details of its aid
to Turkey, Jordan and Egypt before Mr. Kaifu visits those
countries along with Oman and Saudi Arabia, probably in early
October. Mr. Watanabe said the aid would be based on requests
from the countries, which are now being reviewed.
   The process is taking longer than expected, he said, in
part because some countries, instead of asking for grants as
expected, asked for low-interest loans and technical
cooperation. But Mr. Watanabe emphasized that at least part
of the "significant magnitude" of aid that Japan will give
will be outright grants.
   A senior Finance Ministry official had said previously
that Japan wanted aid to be financed by several big countries
jointly and funneled through the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund. The government's news release suggested that
Japan would give the aid both directly and through the World
Bank and IMF, but Mr. Watanabe said that "even if we go ahead
with unilateral aid, we want to have multilateral
coordination."

   James M. Weichert claims (letters, Aug. 17) that a house
that rose in value from $107,000 to $895,000 over 14 years
had an average annual appreciation of 52.6%. Average annual
return refers to an annual compounded rate; an investment of
$107,000 would grow to $39,732,624 in 14 years at an average
annual rate of 52.6%. The correct rate of return is 16.4% --
comparable with an investment in a Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index fund over the same period.

   U.S. Shoe Profit
   In 2nd Quarter
   Decreased 29%

   U.S. Shoe Corp. reported a 29% drop in profit for its
second quarter ended Aug. 4 because of a slowdown in sales at
its Lens-Crafters Optical stores, previously the specialty
retailer's fastest growing unit.
   The Cincinnati-based company, which last month predicted a
second-quarter earnings drop, said the sales slump in
eyeglasses continues in August, but that management believes
it is a temporary reaction to economic uncertainty rather
than a long-term trend.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nonetheless, the company said increased concern about a
general softness in the economy makes management "cautious"
about prospects for the remainder of the year.
   U.S. Shoe's second-quarter net fell to $1.9 million, or
four cents a share, from $2.6 million, or six cents a share,
a year earlier. Sales rose 15% to $671.4 million, from $583.2
million.
   For the first half, net was $19.3 million, or 43 cents a
share, more than double the $7.8 million, or 17 cents a
share, a year ago. Sales climbed 16% to $1.34 billion, from
$1.15 billion.
   Jeffrey S. Stein, retail analyst with McDonald &amp; Co.,
Cleveland, said there were no major surprises in the report.
However, he lowered his earnings estimate for the Jan. 31
fiscal year to $1.60 a share, from $1.75. He now expects
Lens-Crafters to have a second-half earnings decline, and he
has become more concerned about a general softening in retail
sales. Last fiscal year U.S. Shoe earned $49.2 million, or
$1.10 a share, on sales of $2.56 billion.
   Second-quarter operating profit at Lens-Crafters plunged
55% to $5 million, from $11 million a year earlier. While
sales rose 13% to $145.6 million, a larger number of stores
accounted for all of the gain. At the end of the quarter
Lens-Crafters operated 388 stores, up from 305 stores a year
earlier.
   The company said sales in the optical industry softened
suddenly in late April, holding second-quarter
sales-per-store about even with a year earlier after a period
of rapid sales gains. The company said it was difficult to
quickly adjust store-level expenses for the
lower-than-expected sales volume, but that Lens-Crafters did
make the adjustment late in the quarter. Comparable store
sales in August are "modestly below" second-quarter levels,
U.S. Shoe said.
   Women's apparel retailing produced a $531,000 operating
profit in contrast to an operating loss of $174,000 a year
earlier. Sales rose 17% to $313.3 million. Comparable store
sales gains have continued at double-digit levels in August,
and early reaction to the group's fall merchandise is
positive, the company said.
   The footwear group had a 47% rise in second-quarter
operating profit to $7.9 million, on a 14% rise in sales to
$212.6 million. Its second-half earnings outlook is
encouraging, U.S. Shoe said.
   Separately, U.S. Shoe said it will open several
Lens-Crafters stores in the United Kingdom during the fourth
quarter, its first outside the U.S. and Canada. U.S. Shoe
said it may open as many as 100 Lens-Crafter stores in the
U.K. within the next five to seven years. The U.K is a
logical entry point for the $6 billion Western European
optical market, the company said.

   OK, Brett, So It
   Isn't Exactly Bulls
   Loosed in Pamplona
   ---
   Still, the Running of the Sheep
   In Tiny Reedpoint, Mont.,
   Does Have Its Moments
   ----

   REEDPOINT, Mont. -- Before Montana, there was Spain. And
in Spain, there is Pamplona. And in Pamplona each July, there
is the running of the bulls, in which the mighty animals tear
through city streets, from corral to bullring, while
thrill-seeking humans try to dodge or outrun them.
   Ernest Hemingway used Pamplona as a backdrop for "The Sun
Also Rises." As a symbol of adventure and romance, the
running of the bulls there is world-famous.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Which brings us to Reedpoint.
   Reedpoint isn't world-famous. It is hardly even
Montana-famous. It has 96 citizens and seven businesses, and
its high school this year should have a graduating class of
one, assuming Robert Ulmer doesn't stumble along the way. It
is in the wide-open ranch country of the Yellowstone River
valley, where the access ramps to Interstates have grates to
keep the livestock off the four-lane. Reedpoint has no water
system, sewer system, mayor, police force, city government or
city taxes. The signs on the highway south of town spell its
name as one word; the signs on the railroad north of town
spell it as two.
   Nonetheless, little Reedpoint has at least one thing that
puts it squarely, if gently, in the heroic tradition. As
surely as July means Pamplona and the bulls, September means
Reedpoint. And the sheep.
   Next Sunday, thousands of people are expected to flock to
Reedpoint for what is being billed as the "101st Running of
the Sheep." (It is actually only the second running of the
sheep, but more about that later.) The festivities stretch
from morning until midnight, but the main event comes around
noon, when a thousand or so sheep will be herded the four
blocks down Reedpoint's main street, from the abandoned grain
elevators at the north to the Conoco service station at the
south, threading their way through the humanity. People can
race or pet or mingle with the sheep. The sheep, unlike the
bulls at Pamplona, don't seem to mind.
   "The sheep are so docile," says Russell Schlievert, an
organizer of the event, which is a civic fund-raiser
sponsored by a group called the Reedpoint Community Club.
"It's a very hands-on thing."
   Last year's thing started as a low-budget spoof of a
high-priced cattle drive that was the biggest event of
Montana's 1989 centennial celebration. Reedpoint ended up
attracting an estimated 12,000 people, and it raised enough
money to pay for doubling the size of the Reedpoint Memorial
Library, to two rooms from one. This year's proceeds will go
toward buying a used fire truck and emergency medical
equipment for the town.
   No one knows how big a crowd to expect this year -- or
what to expect from the crowd. Last year, many people arrived
with their favorite sheep in tow and in costume. One sheep
wore tennis shoes. Another was painted to resemble an
American flag.
   The winner of the Prettiest Ewe contest wore red-and-black
satin garters on her legs and a lacey bonnet on her head; her
owner, who led the sheep on a leash, wore a matching bonnet
and turn-of-the-century satin dress. The Ugliest Sheep
winner, by contrast, had a polka-dot look, its shaved coat
punctuated with unshorn clumps of wool, which were dyed
various colors.
   Aside from the beauty pageant, events this year range from
a parade to a street dance to a "sheep-to-shawl" contest,
which is exactly what it sounds like and is expected to take
six hours or so; the shawls will be auctioned. On the
cultural front, there are sheepherder-poetry readings.
(Sample from last year: The place I lived in wa'nt too clean/
It smelled like somethin' died/ When I talked to other
people/ They'd stay on the upwind side.)
   And there's the Smelliest Sheepherder event. Last year, it
began as a joke, with a few adequately groomed sheep men
gamely getting up on stage to the hoots of the crowd.
Suddenly, the real thing -- a herder named Festus, straight
from the hills -- pushed his way through the crowd, climbed
up on stage -- and literally overwhelmed the competition.
   "Everybody else on stage just turned around and walked
away and said, `Hey, it's his,'" says Mr. Schlievert, who
emceed the contest. "Then he got up and talked about living
on the range with the sheep." (Festus couldn't be located for
comment or for determining his last name. He's out with his
herd.)
   The idea for a sheep drive came when the Reedpoint
Community Club began looking last year for a new gimmick to
liven up its annual Labor Day weekend fund-raiser, Bachelor
Daze. That event, which included the auctioning of bachelors,
usually attracted a couple of thousand people to town, but
the idea was getting old, as were the bachelors.
   At the time, the Montana press was playing up something
called the Great Montana Centennial Cattle Drive, a six-day
extravaganza in which anyone could ride along with the herd
and play cowboy at a price of not much more than, say, six
days in Paris or Rome. Reedpoint decided that it might be fun
to have something a little more down-to-earth. Sheep are
about as down-to-earth as you can get; here in cattle
country, they're treated as rather a joke. Soon, the Great
Montana Centennial Sheep Drive was born.
   The parallel with Pamplona's bulls was pointed out by a
newspaper reporter in Billings, about 60 miles east of here;
Reedpoint folks hadn't heard of Pamplona. But the small-town
promoters proved adept at big-city media manipulation.
   "We took our sheep to downtown Billings, unloaded them
right in front of the TV stations and let them eat their
flowers and stuff until they came out and interviewed us,"
says Chery Leicht, who was secretary-treasurer of the
Community Club last year.
   The word spread, and on Labor Day weekend, people
descended on Reedpoint. Vendors ran out of food by
midafternoon. Connie MacLean, the official silkscreener, ran
out of T-shirts; after selling 560 of them that day, she
later had to print up and mail another 400 to people who left
orders. The event was thoroughly homespun: One old ranch lady
set up a gas stove on a corner and made fried bread for
passers-by.
   "The Great Montana Centennial Sheep Drive must be the most
successful spoof since Orson Welles's `War of the Worlds' was
broadcast in 1938," an editorial in the Billings Gazette
declared. "Certainly it was the most fun."
   It also brought money into a town that doesn't have much
of its own. The high-school girls' basketball team made
enough from its hamburger stand to pay for new jerseys and a
trip to Billings for the district tournament. And the
Community Club netted enough -- $9,131 -- for a 20-by-22-foot
addition to the library, a former one-room schoolhouse
roughly 12-by-14 feet.
   "It was unbelievable," says Librarian Evelyn Burton, a
retired schoolteacher, whose house is next door to the
library. (People don't have library cards in Reedpoint,
because Mrs. Burton knows everyone by name.) Mrs. Burton says
that as a result of the expansion, she is considering
increasing the library's hours -- or, more precisely, hour:
It's open from 3 to 4 every Wednesday afternoon.
   Given the success of last year's event, there was no
question but that it would be revived this year. Indeed, the
only issue was what to call it. The organizers settled on the
"101st Running of the Sheep" -- even though it's only the
second -- because it's Montana's 101st birthday. "It didn't
make much sense to me," says Ms. MacLean, the silkscreener.
"But I think they just liked the sound of it."
   It sounds like a tradition, an end-of-summer celebration
that every year should give Reedpoint its moment in the sun.
It might even become a continuing boon to the town's coffers.
At least, say many residents, isn't it pretty to think so?

   RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- Fleetwood Enterprises Inc., which
produces recreational vehicles and manufactured housing, said
its board authorized the purchase of an additional two
million, or 9%, of its 22 million common shares outstanding.
A previously authorized buy-back of two million shares has
been nearly completed at a cost of $34.6 million.
   Fleetwood also said net income for its first quarter ended
July 29 fell 31% to $10.8 million, or 48 cents a share, from
$15.6 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-earlier
quarter, which ended July 30. Sales slipped 1% to $389.2
million from $394.9 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company blamed the earnings decline on lower
recreational-vehicle sales and a shift in buyers' preference
for lowerpriced products with narrower profit margins. Strong
sales of manufactured housing were more than offset by the
decline in recreational-vehicle sales, Fleetwood said.

   STANLEY WORKS directors boosted the quarterly dividend 11%

million, or 7.1%, of its shares outstanding. The board
declared a dividend of 30 cents a share, up from 27 cents,
payable Sept. 29 to stock of record Sept. 10. Richard H.
Ayers, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
dividend action reflects the New Britain, Conn., company's
confidence in its prospects. The board authorized the
buy-back because it considers Stanley Works shares
undervalued, he added. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, Stanley Works shares rose 75 cents to
$30.375.

   In "Socialism Is Dead; Leviathan Lives" (editorial page,
July 18), James Buchanan correctly argues that centralized
management of economies has not worked and cannot work. He is
much less convincing in his argument that laissez-faire
economics has worked and can work.
   A free-market economy can indeed produce more goods, but
suppose it produces more than can be sold? According to
Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt,
"destructive," "excessive" and "cutthroat" competition was
the primary cause of the Great Depression, and both took
steps to restrict competition. Bernard Baruch, the leading
financier of his time, proposed in 1930 the creation of a
worldwide "Supreme Court of Business" to restrict
"overproduction."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Maybe they were wrong, but why do economists never
consider the possibility? In cutthroat competition,
"protectionism" is only an attempt to ensure job security,
and fully understandable. I assume Mr. Buchanan is familiar
with the benefits of protectionism -- unless he and his
colleagues are actively opposed to professorial tenure.

   Recently you noted (editorial, Aug. 2) that Meryl Streep
is analyzing Hollywood's employment practices. Projecting
from a study showing "men had twice as many roles as women in
1989's movies, Ms. Streep says that . . . `by the year 2000,
we will have 13% of roles . . . and in 20 years, we will be
eliminated from the movies.'" But will the trend stop there?
   Golly, this is even worse than she imagined, because when
the trend is projected for an additional 10 years, men will
be playing women] And yes, there is irrefutable evidence to
support this: 10 years ago, one man, Dustin Hoffman, played
one woman in "Tootsie." Today, two men, Eric Idle and Robbie
Coltrane, play two women in "Nuns on the Run." The trend is
obvious.

   Michael Gartner's spirited defense of what he alleges to
be First Amendment rights of the press and his attack on the
arguments of the Supreme Court (op-ed page, July 19) suggest
why the media generate suspicion and hostility in some
quarters.
   Tattered though it might be by some judicial decisions the
cloak of the First Amendment should be the critical shield of
a democracy's free press protecting it from chilling winds of
self-appointed censors but not used to allow anyone to expose
freely unsupported critical allegations just by flashing a
press pass.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Claims of untouchable authority in voicing opinion by the
columnist/editorialist/journalist/author, who may or may not
have any hard evidence, leave the subject of an attack
defenseless and, even worse, encourage the growth of sloppy
and lazy reporting.
   In exercising proper sensitivity to the very real threat
to their role the media should not lose sight of their
responsibility and the real fears of the citizenry. In a
paraphrase of a remark about war, perhaps the freedom of the
press is too important to leave to network-news executives.
   Nathan Kingsley

   ---
   The press has been able to affect careers and, for that
matter, national policy with absolutely no regard for the
consequences. The Spanish-American War, the internment of
Japanese-American citizens and the McCarthy era are good
examples of this.
   If an opinion carries the same weight as a fact, then the
consequences must be recognized. The court's decision to make
people responsible for what they say in no way weakens the
First Amendment.

   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered
its ratings on Bank of New York Co.'s long-term debt and
commercial paper.
   The rating concern's action affects a total of $1.2
billion of securities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moody's downgraded Bank of New York senior debt to
single-A-3 from single-A-2, subordinated debt to Baa-1 from
single-A-3, preferred stock to single-A-3 from single-A2; and
commercial paper to prime-2 from prime-1.
   Moody's said its move "primarily reflects the company's
exposure to highly leveraged transaction lending." It said
that "although these portfolios have exhibited only moderate
deterioration in asset quality, they nevertheless remain
substantial in relation to equity and reserves."
   A Bank of New York spokesman said that the company regrets
Moody's decision but that it will work with the rating
concern to improve the ratings.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bank of New York shares closed at $23.50, down 25 cents.

   ORANGE, Calif. -- West Coast Bancorp said its
third-quarter results will include a $1.4 million loan
write-off that is expected to reduce net income by $850,000,
or nine cents a share.
   West Coast Bancorp said the increase in provision for
possible credit losses stems from its inactive nonbanking
subsidiary, West Coast Realty Finance. The loan is secured by
a second deed of trust on a 60,000-square-foot office
building.

   Saab-Scania Stake
   Of 22% Is Bought

   STOCKHOLM -- AB Investor and AB Providentia, key holding
companies in Sweden's Wallenberg group, exercised an option
to buy a 22% voting stake in Saab-Scania AB in a transaction
valued at 4.3 billion Swedish kronor ($751.3 million).
   The move, which was expected, boosted the Wallenberg
group's voting stake to 58% in Saab-Scania, an auto and
aerospace group. The transaction rekindled market speculation
that the Wallenbergs plan to take Saab-Scania private in what
would be Sweden's biggest-ever leveraged buy-out.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Expectations of such a buy-out have buoyed the price of
Saab-Scania shares amid volatile, declining markets here in
recent weeks. Saab-Scania B-free shares, the series most
traded internationally, rose 10 kronor ($1.747) during the
past week but closed unchanged at 250 kronor yesterday on the
Stockholm Stock Exchange.
   Investor and Providentia said they are seeking "to create
an ownership structure able to optimize Saab-Scania's
long-term development potential." The companies added that
"this process is continuing" but declined to elaborate.
   The option pact completed yesterday dates from late April.
At that time, Investor and Providentia agreed to pay a hefty
premium over prevailing market prices for Saab-Scania stock
to dispose of a big, unfriendly holder, Sven-Olof Johansson,
a Stockholm property tycoon. Mr. Johansson had assembled the
Saab-Scania holding through aggressive market purchases over
several months.
   However, the Wallenbergs, who had held sway in
Saab-Scania's boardroom for decades, rebuffed Mr. Johansson's
requests for board representation. That soured relations. And
when the investor threatened to offer his Saab-Scania stake
to other, potentially hostile Swedish investors, Investor and
Providentia stepped in with a pre-emptive bid.
   The holding companies said financing for the purchase of
Mr. Johansson's stake would be arranged in both Swedish and
international capital markets. The Saab-Scania transaction is
only one of several completed by the Wallenberg group this
year. For instance, Investor and Providentia provided 25% of
the financing for affiliate Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB's
4 billion mark ($2.57 billion) takeover of West Germany's
Feldmuehle Nobel AG in May.

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc., a
brokerage firm, said its chairman and chief executive
officer, J. Craighill Redwine, resigned.
   Mr. Redwine, 49 years old, was named chief executive in
1986. In an interview, he said that he had decided "it was
time to move on" from his posts, and that there wasn't any
pressure to leave the firm. He said that he probably will
remain in the brokerage industry, but that he doesn't have
any immediate plans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Interstate/Johnson, one of the largest brokerage firms in
the Southeast, has had several quarters of declining revenue
and widening losses. In the quarter ended June 30, the
company had a loss of $1.4 million, or 20 cents a share, on
revenue of $31.9 million. The loss included a $750,000 charge
related to litigation.
   Elmon L. Vernier Jr., president and chief operating
officer, said Interstate/Johnson's board decided to leave Mr.
Redwine's posts vacant temporarily. The company, Mr. Vernier
said, is reviewing its businesses and options to develop a
"strategic direction."

   Middle East Crisis Has Made
   Amman, Jordan, the Spot
   To Cut Used-Car Deals

   AMMAN, Jordan -- Ahmed Kamil is a deal-making man from
Sudan. He wants to sell you his two-tone Mercedes Benz for a
rock bottom $2,000. "One thousand now, the rest in two
hours," he says, wiping the car down with a fold of his
flowing white robe. Across town, a Pakistani named Mohammed
will sell you a "like new" Chevy Caprice for only $1,200.
Nearby, Youssef, a Yemeni, offers a test drive in his 1988
Ram Charger, and "the very best price in Amman."
   Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait three weeks ago, Jordan's
capital has become a sprawling, used-car bazaar. The refugees
flooding in from Kuwait bring cars with them. Nice cars, the
kind that once cruised Kuwait city: luxurious and thirsty for
Persian Gulf gas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But gas isn't cheap anymore, and most of the refugees
desperately need cash. Stranded in Jordan, waiting for boats
or planes to carry them to their native lands, many are
off-loading the one real asset they still have.
   Most cars come with extras such as air conditioning. Some
even sport the new license plates issued by Baghdad,
designating Kuwait as a province of Iraq. But registration
papers aren't always part of the deal. In the chaos following
the Iraqi raid, many foreign workers made off with cars
belonging to Kuwaitis on vacation in Europe, or in flight to
Saudi Arabia.
   As showrooms, the refugees are using the parking lots of
mosques, embassies and union halls where most are camped out
until they find a way home. This makes for unlikely
juxtapositions. In the yard of one mosque, women string
laundry between trees and snooze on the ground while their
husbands hustle luxury-class cars. Asked for paperwork on his
BMW, one Sudanese man explains apologetically that it blew
out the window on the long desert drive through Iraq.
   Jordanian officials seize most of the stolen cars at the
border, though enough are slipping through -- along with
thousands of legally owned cars -- to seriously depress
Amman's established used-car market.
   "I haven't sold a car in 10 days," complains dealer
Mohammed Assi, who specializes in luxury vehicles. He gazes
across his silent showroom at a gleaming Mercedes 300SE,
which sells for the equivalent of $50,000. "People come in
and say, `Why should I pay that when I can get one from a
Yemeni for $5,000?'" he says.
   Mr. Assi says he won't buy stolen cars for resale because
"God is watching." But not all car dealers are so upright.
Asked why Kuwaiti cars are on sale at improbably low prices,
one dealer responds that the wind, sand and heat in the
sheikdom mean that "cars from Kuwait depreciate very
quickly."
   In fact, used cars here -- as everywhere -- rarely are the
bargains they appear. Car sales in Jordan are tightly
controlled and buyers who want to keep the cars in the
country must pay duty of 140% or more, based on blue-book
value. As a result, many of the buyers are companies with
foreign employees, who can buy duty-free, or mechanics who
chop the cars up for spare parts.
   Others are hoping to turn a few fast dinars by selling the
cars overseas. Zayed Kurdi, who works as a restaurant cashier
in Amman, took a day off this week to visit a makeshift car
lot outside the city where several hundred Kuwaiti vehicles
are on sale. His plan is to buy a car for a few hundred
dollars and drive it to Lebanon, where he can sell it for
several thousand. "The only question," he says, kicking the
tires on a dusty Toyota Cressida, "is can I get to Beirut and
back without being killed or robbed?"
   The feverish car market creates problems for refugees who
aren't actively peddling their automobiles. The sight of
Kuwaiti plates has become a Pavlovian trigger for passing
Jordanians to start haggling. "People pull up at red lights
or follow me home and say, `Let's make a deal,'" says Essam
Hammad, a Jordanian who returned home from Kuwait in his 230E
Mercedes. He says he paid $20,000 for the car in Kuwait five
years ago and doesn't intend to give away what is now his
only valuable possession. But as a visiting American admires
the car, Mr. Hammad reconsiders.
   "If you have U.S. dollars," he says, "maybe I am
flexible."

   I read with interest your July 19 "Lawyers Who Switch
Sides Draw Ire With Big Checks." It raises questions about
the relationship between attorney and client.
   Jerry Jackson, formerly with the National Wildlife
Federation and now with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom
is undertaking the defense of what appears to be a state
agency that has been accused of polluting the environment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While it would be unethical of Mr. Jackson to comment on
the particular case strategy absent a release from his
client, he could hypothesize as to whether he would "defend"
clients who are clearly wrong, or if he felt that his
obligations under his public trust as an attorney would
either compel him to decline the engagement or ensure that
his obligation as an attorney was not in conflict with his
client's objectives. This is especially true where the
conduct alleged to be in error is continuing.
   Barbara Brown, the women's rights attorney now
representing corporations in sex-discrimination matters,
might have been asked what she would do if, upon independent
investigation by her, she found her corporate client had
indeed done the dastardly deeds outlined in the complaint.
Would she tell her client to settle and pay up, or defend to
the bitter end if that is what the client desired?
   There is a fine line that separates ethics and advocacy,
and many times a substantial fee or career walks along that
line with you.
   Where one stands on those types of issues is the real test
of character.

   Since the days of President Eliot {of Harvard}, educators
have been talking about the needs of students. We are always
being told, in the case of dress codes, co-ed dormitories,
and campus cultural events, that students are mature men and
women who know what they want. Fine, then, let them have it.
Abolish all university-wide restrictions and do away with
tenure. Turn each faculty member into an independent
contractor, something like a paperboy, who is not paid a
fixed salary but a commission for every paper he sells on his
route. Teachers who are popular for whatever reason -- for
their sex appeal, their low standards, or even for their
merits as scholars and teachers -- would be paid commensurate
with the number of students they attracted. Others would
starve.

   To Stephen Leeb, it's deja vu. He says he finds today's
stock market such a striking parallel to the market at the
outset of the Korean war that he forces himself to restrain
his enthusiasm so he doesn't "sound like some kind of a nut."
   It's all there, says Mr. Leeb, editor of Personal Finance,
an investment advisory publication. The economic picture in
1950 was much the same: Low growth, little inflation and
relatively low interest rates. The immediate effect of the
Korean crisis was a surge in prices of basic commodities;
this time, it's oil. The market plunged 15% in five weeks
then -- just as it plunged 14% in three weeks this time.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And here's the part Mr. Leeb likes best: After the initial
shock, the market took off on one of the greatest rallies in
postwar history. Six months later it had climbed 25% from its
low.
   With today's stock markets under seige for three weeks --
and now sending mixed signals -- some analysts are looking to
history to figure out where stocks will end up. And many of
them say recent activity has the earmarks of classic "crisis
markets," which have historically provided profit
opportunities for the shrewd -- and courageous -- investor.
   Consider the 24% decline in the market following President
Kennedy's face-off with U.S. Steel Corp. in early 1962. The
market was convinced that a liberal, anti-business president
was about to send the economy reeling into a recession,
recalls Robert Stovall, head of Stovall/Twenty First
Advisers.
   During the worst days of spring 1962, Polaroid shares
plummeted from $236 to $81 and International Business
Machines' share price was slashed in half to $300. But the
recession of 1962 never happened. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average shot up 22% in the following six months and was 32%
ahead a year later. Mr. Stovall, comforted by history,
doesn't think the feared recession of 1990 will materialize,
either.
   Says William Lefevre, chief market strategist for Advest &amp;
Co., who agrees that most panic sell-offs don't evolve into
bear markets: "Investor fears are like nightmares: They
rarely come true."
   There's certainly no question that investors have reacted
wildly to any news during the current crisis in the Middle
East. The industrial average stood at 2899.26 on Aug. 1.
Then, with investors jolted by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and
the possibility of a Persian Gulf war, the average plunged
416 points.
   But last Friday it suddenly leaped 49.50 points, following
up Monday with a 78.71 gain to 2611.63, the biggest one-day
rise since last Oct. 16. Since then, with the crisis creating
no big news, the market has drifted, closing yesterday at
2632.43, up 17.58.
   To Mr. Leeb, this is an opportunity.
   "Of the eight crises that have spooked the market since
World War II," he says, "in all but one of them the market
was up significantly six months and 12 months later."
   All of these panic sell-offs -- after events such as the
Soviet launching of Sputnik and President Nixon's resignation
-- resulted in a quick decline of at least 10%.
   The exception to Mr. Leeb's rule, under the circumstances,
is an unfortunate one: the crisis touched off by the 1973-74
oil embargo. Like that sell-off, the Iraq drop may have been
rooted in genuine concern about the direct impact of the
incident on the availability of oil.
   In broad terms, there's an eerie parallel between then and
now: a sickly economy suddenly battered by the shock of
surging oil prices. The result then was a deep recession that
eventually swept away about 45% of the stock market's value.
If the parallel holds true to that frightful pattern, that
would mean an eventual decline of the industrial average to
1650 from its summer peak.
   The stock market just before Iraq's invasion also looked
very much as it did in the days just before the October 1973
Arab oil embargo, imposed in the wake of the Arab-Israeli
war. Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis group
at Salomon Brothers, notes that the market just prior to the
embargo was characterized by big price gains in blue-chip
stocks that put that select group far ahead of the broader
market.
   The situation was remarkably like the blue-chip buying
binge that pushed the industrial average to its all-time high
of 2999.75 in July while less-favored stocks, such as those
in the over-the-counter market, lagged far behind.
   The assumption in 1973, as well as last month, was that
large growth stocks, the biggest and best-managed companies
in the nation, were essentially immune to the ups and downs
of an economic cycle. But when the crunch came in 1973, the
blue-chips were brought abruptly to heel, just as they have
been in 1990.
   "What is disturbing is that the broad market is leading
the way down and the blue chips are following," Mr. Spence
says. "What you want to see in a market bottom is the broad
market acting better than the blue chips."
   Most analysts find more differences than similarities
between now and 1973. For instance, the oil supply situation
today is far less grave, prices haven't risen nearly as much
on a percentage basis, Americans have become more sanguine
about higher oil prices and inflation isn't the problem now
it was then.
   Another major difference, says David Wyss, director of
research at Data Resources, is that the dollar has fallen
sharply in recent weeks; investment capital seeking a safe
haven has flowed to Europe, where interest rates are higher.
In 1973 the dollar rose, hurting U.S. exports and adding more
recessionary pressure to an economy with tight credit that
was already closing in on a recession. This time around, with
a declining dollar, exports should be stimulated, Mr. Wyss
believes.
   Americans are less exposed, too. In the 1970s, the average
American had 40% of financial assets in stocks; that's now
just 20%.
   But while optimistic investors find plenty of reasons to
dismiss parallels between now and 1973, they are quick to
cite similarities with other crisis-related selloffs that had
happier endings.
   There's the 14% drop in four weeks in May 1970, during a
liquidity crisis symbolized by the failure of Penn Central
Co. Over the following year, investors pushed stocks up 44%.
   Even the financial panic of October 1987 didn't touch off
a long-lasting market debacle. Despite the 22.6% plunge on
Oct. 19, the market recovered. It was up 15% six months later
and toted up a 23% gain off the low point within a year.
   To Robert Ritter, chief market strategist of Ladenburg,
Thalmann &amp; Co., "This has all the earmarks of 1962."
   The plunge in the spring of 1962 was touched off by a
now-famous quote of President Kennedy about businessmen.
Referring to the double cross he believed had occurred after
U.S. Steel raised prices despite his help in securing a labor
settlement, the president reportedly told an aide: "My father
always told me that all businessmen were sons of bitches, but
I never believed it till now." The president evidently added
fuel to the fire when he further criticized the business
establishment at a commencement speech at Yale University in
June.
   Mr. Ritter says that then, as now, there was a deceptively
strong stock market, with relatively high price-earnings
multiples for the market's most heavily owned stocks, and a
generally weak economic environment. Just as in July of this
year, he says, there was a "weak top" because the broader
market averages had been performing poorly for the prior
year.
   Despite all that, Mr. Ritter is not yet convinced the
downturn this time will end as happily as it did then because
there are so many other issues this time, from the savings
and loan crisis to the budget deficit.
   And he mentions another historical point: October is
around the corner, and it has often been a bad time for the
market.
   Wall Street veteran Philip Carret, chairman of Carret &amp;
Co., a money management firm, sees a reason for optimism if
war breaks out, based on the Korean war example and other
history: He says armed conflict has often been good for the
market. "Usually after the first shock, the market tends to
get bullish," he says.
   Many disagree with that. Mr. Leeb says investors became
bullish during the Korean conflict, as he expects they will
now, because the slow economic activity going into the war
had already set the stage for the Federal Reserve Board to
stimulate growth by keeping interest rates down. Mr. Leeb
expects that the Fed is poised now to lower interest rates
despite the extra nudge that a rise in oil prices could give
to inflation.
   In other words, Mr. Leeb says -- and many analysts agree
-- it was not the Korean war itself that sent the market on a
tear after the initial fears subsided. These analysts say
that wars are not necessarily good for the economy or the
stock markets.
   On the plus side, wars tend to lead to full employment and
increased industrial production. But besides inflationary
impact, wars can eventually help stall an economy because so
much of the stimulated production is actually non-productive.
The engines that are built, for instance, are not used to
produce more goods.
   The market's record during World War II was spotty -- a
two-year bear market followed by a bull market. Similarly,
while the early years of the Vietnam war coincided with a
powerful bull market, there were down periods in the second
half of the 1960s.
   All of which means absolutely nothing for today anyway,
according to some market watchers who say history, in the
present case, is bunk. "I don't compare this with anything,"
says Dudley Eppel, head of trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette. Except for the October 1987 crash, "those other
things were child's play. There's much more volatility" in
the market now -- so much so, he says, that if it weren't for
"circuit breakers" that impede heavy computer-driven program
trading when prices fluctuate sharply, "we might have had
another 1987 now."
   Some money managers also resist drawing on their memories
of past markets to make investment decisions. "Those who
worship at the altar of historic parallels get boxed in,"
says John Neff, manager of the $6.7 billion Windsor mutual
fund, who has been in the business 35 years.
   Unlike most investment managers, Mr. Neff has been buying
stocks aggressively throughout the August downturn, reducing
his fund's cash position to 13% of assets from 19% before the
Aug. 2 invasion.
   About $80 million of Mr. Neff's $390 million of new
investments went into the market last Thursday, a day the Dow
industrials plunged 76.73 points. Among the stocks he found
attractive after their recent drubbing were some whose
fortunes are tied to the economic cycle: chemicals, aluminum,
paper and airlines.
   But even though Mr. Neff says history isn't important, he
recalls his own reaction to the sell-off of 1973-74. He
waited for a while, then bought heavily into what he calls
"lesser recognized growth stocks" that were down as much as
70%, including Pizza Hut, Tandy, Browning-Ferris and Hospital
Corp. of America.
   The result: His Windsor Fund outperformed the market for
three years.

   WASHINGTON -- The financial troubles at the Small Business
Administration's venture-capital program are intensifying and
are likely to worsen if the economy deteriorates, top
lawmakers and officials say. But the program, which has
helped finance thousands of small businesses over the past
three decades, will almost certainly survive the crisis,
these experts believe.
   The SBA program licenses small business investment
companies, or SBICs, to provide government-guaranteed loans
and equity financing for small companies. For the immediate
future, it faces a period of retrenchment as lawmakers and
government officials try to piece together what led to a
string of failures of SBICs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The SBA ordered a moratorium on granting new SBIC licenses
in June, and auditors from its inspector general's office
just completed an exhaustive scrutiny of the books at about
20 of them. At the same time, the SBA has asked the Justice
Department to decide whether to sue the directors of the
largest failed SBIC, River Capital Corp. of Springfield, Va.
   An SBA study shows potential SBIC losses of more than $800
million. (SBICs currently hold $1.4 billion in leveraged
federal funds.) Sen. Dale Bumpers, chairman of the Senate
Small Business Committee that recently completed hearings on
the program's troubles, calls the SBIC insolvencies "a
mini-savings and loan" crisis. "It's hard for me to have
faith in a program that could possibly lose half of the money
it's borrowed," the Arkansas Democrat says.
   A combination of factors contributed to the mess.
Officials lay much of the blame on lax regulation by the SBA
and poor management by some investment companies. The
procedures under which the companies operate also have come
under criticism. To be licensed as an SBIC, investors need $1
million in private capital. They can then borrow as much as
four times that amount from the agency, and can renew their
debentures or loan commitments. The result, say some experts,
can be continuous, rolling loans that last until a company's
investments run into trouble.
   In addition to all this, the risk inherent in financing
small, growth-oriented enterprises increases as U.S. economic
growth slows. The fragile economy could mean more problems,
Sen. Bumpers believes. So far this year, about 25 companies
have gone into liquidation, double the program's annual
average. A recession could mean a tripling or quadrupling of
liquidations, the senator predicts.
   Although the inspector general's office hasn't released
results of its review, the consensus on Capitol Hill and in
industry circles is that the program's past successes will
guarantee continuing congressional approval. SBICs provided
the start-up money for the likes of Apple Computer Inc. and
Federal Express Corp. Sen. Bumpers says they have generated
enough tax revenues to more than cover the cost of all the
SBA's losses.
   He and other committee members praised SBA Administrator
Susan Engeleiter for swift damage-control action, including
replacing the program's director and toughening the
accounting practices of investment-company auditors.
   The SBA has also been active in following up the 1988
River Capital failure, which will cost the government about
$29 million. In addition to asking the Justice Department to
decide whether to sue the company's directors, SBA general
counsel Sally Narey says, it asked the department to
determine whether charges should be brought against Arthur
Andersen &amp; Co., the accounting firm that was under contract
to review River Capital's records and investment procedures.
   The SBA contends that Arthur Andersen should have looked
more deeply into whether River Capital's managers were
correctly valuing its investments, while the accounting firm
maintains it performed its role properly. In a review of the
case, the General Accounting Office didn't blame Arthur
Andersen for the company's failure but strongly recommended
the use of government auditing standards for investment
concerns.
   During the recent Senate hearings, SBA officials and other
witnesses blamed poor management decisions by the investment
companies and inadequate regulation by the agency for the
current crisis. One of River Capital's main investments, for
example, was a hazardous waste disposal company in Rhode
Island that never won a state permit.
   Until recently, the SBA had only five staffers handling
SBIC liquidations; they were responsible for a caseload that
experts say would have required 50 people by private industry
standards. The failure of another SBIC, Royal Business Funds
Inc. of New York, left the SBA saddled with a Colorado ski
resort that agency officials operated for several years at a
loss of $11 million. This month, First Connecticut Small
Business Investment Co. of Bridgeport went into bankruptcy
proceedings owing the SBA about $28 million.
   Currently, 159 SBICs are in liquidation proceedings, owing
Uncle Sam about $476 million, the SBA says. The agency says
it expects to collect about half of the sum, which doesn't
include interest owed on the money. So far this year, the
agency has collected $66 million from the assets of failed
investment companies. And an earlier review by the inspector
general's office found that the SBA risks losing another $130
million from still-operating SBICs with a high risk of
failing.
   Representatives of the SBIC industry say the negative
publicity resulting from the hearings and the moratorium on
new licensing has been unfair.
   "We hope the hearings and the spotlight on the business
failures will be a cleansing experience," says Peter McNeish,
president of the National Association of Small Business
Investment Companies.
   Some venture capitalists also believe indictments of the
program have been overblown. Jim Parsons, a general partner
with RFE Investment Partners, New Canaan, Conn., says while
there have been "problems in the industry, this is a pretty
risky means of investment. I think on balance, the program
has been a real benefit to the economy."
   JoAnn Price, president of the National Association of
Investment Companies that represents minority-owned SBICs,
often called Mesbics, worries that the negative publicity
will hurt efforts to expand private capital available to
those companies. Congressional aides and others familiar with
the industry say Mesbics have had far fewer problems than
SBICs in general.
   This is a critical time for small business, which faces a
dearth of start-up financing. Venture firms have been moving
away from high-risk financing of small and early-stage
companies to larger, more established ones. Many venture
capitalists believe if funds continue to dry up for start-ups
in the 1990s, SBICs will be relied on more than they are
today.

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Litton Industries Inc. announced
a 2.5 million-share expansion of its buy-back program and a
proposed $1 billion note offering, and posted a 2.3% decline
in net income for its fourth quarter ended July 31.
   The diversified technology concern's profit fell to $45.5
million, or $1.91 a share, from $46.6 million, or $1.86 a
share, in the year-earlier fiscal fourth quarter. The
per-share profit rise reflected a 5% shrinkage in shares
outstanding from Litton's continuing repurchase program.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales rose 6.8% to $1.41 billion from $1.32 billion.
   The company said its Advanced Electronics segment has been
hurt by the effects of a tightening defense budget. Operating
profit in the segment fell 17%, largely reflecting a slowdown
in military demand for spare parts and other equipment in
Litton's fiscal fourth period.
   Improved results in Litton's Resource Exploration Services
business were largely offset by weakness in the Industrial
Automation Systems business, which has been hurt by delays in
the start of new engine programs by U.S. auto makers, the
company said.
   Litton's oil-services subsidiary "has experienced
accelerating revenues and profits over the past two years in
a recovering energy market," said Orion L. Hoch, Litton
chairman, who characterized the unit as "an especially
promising growth business for Litton." The company's
shipbuilding segment also reported higher earnings and sales.
   Litton said it expects to raise about $265 million from
its proposed offering of $1 billion face amount at maturity
of zero-coupon bonds, due 2010. The bonds, which are called
liquid yield option notes, are expected to pay a yield of
6.75% to maturity and to be convertible, at Litton's option,
into common stock or cash.
   Litton said proceeds will be used to retire $440 million
of floating-rate subordinated notes. The current rate is
about 9.625%. "The transaction will reduce our interest
expense and improve our cash flow," Mr. Hoch said. Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets, a unit of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., is the
underwriter.
   Litton said the boost in its stock buy-back program brings
to about three million the number of its shares the company
now is authorized to purchase. As of July 31, Litton had 22.4
million common shares outstanding. Litton said it bought back
nearly 2.2 million shares in the latest fiscal year ended
July 31.
   Investors reacted favorably to the announcements. Litton
shares rose $1 to close at $75.75 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday.
   "Investors are recognizing that Litton has the ability to
grow earnings per share, even in a difficult economic
environment," Howard Rubel, an analyst at C.J. Lawrence,
Morgan Grenfell Inc., said. "The earnings weren't bad, even
though the company has some defense exposure." Mr. Rubel
expects Litton to earn $7.50 a share in fiscal 1991.
   For fiscal 1990, Litton's net edged up less than 1% to
$178.8 million, or $7.26 a share, from $178.3 million, or
$7.05 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 2.7% to $5.16
billion from $5.02 billion.

   Covering the War Is CENSORED

   Here's something you should know about that war that's
going on in the Gulf:
   Much of the news that you read or hear or see is being
censored.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Any reporter who showed up last week in Saudi Arabia was
given a list by our military people. It said, among other
things:
   The following categories of information are not
releasable.
   (1) Number of troops.
   (2) Number of aircraft.
   (3) Number of other equipment (e.g. artillery, tanks,
radars, trucks, water "buffaloes," etc.).
   (4) Names of military installations/geographic locations
of U.S. military units in Saudi Arabia.
   (5) Information regarding future operations.
   (6) Information concerning security precautions at
military installations in Saudi Arabia.
   (7) Names/hometowns of U.S. military personnel being
interviewed {although that seems to have been relaxed over
the weekend}, and names of Saudis being interviewed.
Commanders of U.S. units being interviewed are excepted from
this provision.
   {The list omits (8).}
   (9) Photography that would show level of security at
military installations in Saudi Arabia.
   (10) Photography that would reveal the name or specific
location of military forces or installations.
   And, the rules add, "If you are not sure whether an action
you take will violate a ground rule, consult with your escort
officer PRIOR TO TAKING THAT ACTION."
   When they're on military bases occupied by U.S. troops,
reporters are constantly accompanied by U.S. military
"escorts." These escorts listen in on virtually every
interview and conversation. Censors, performing a "security
review," read the stories of some print reporters before the
pieces are filed. Censors on occasion tell TV reporters they
can't do this or that story.
   Reporters are told where they can go and can't go in Saudi
Arabia -- put simply, they can't go very many places -- and
the television reporters are forbidden from telling their
viewers just where the reporters are other than "someplace in
Saudi Arabia." When not on military bases, the reporters
often are accompanied by Saudi bureaucrats who hamper and
hinder the newsgathering.
   So what we have is this: A war, or near-war, that has not
been declared by the president, that has not been debated by
Congress, and that cannot be reported by the press. Further,
it's a three-front war, and no reporters can get into Kuwait,
the few who get into Iraq can get no meaningful information,
and those allowed into Saudi Arabia are censored.
   "At the first post-Cold War moment when we're putting
Americans in harm's way, we aren't, it seems to me, being
provided a sufficient amount of information to really engage
meaningfully in a debate about whether or not this is
appropriate," Bob Kerrey, the Vietnam Medal of Honor winner
who now is the Democratic senator from Nebraska, said on
"Meet the Press" last Sunday.
   "I know from reading the newspaper that it's hot in the
desert and that the chow is bad," he went on, and the
implication was clear: that's about all the American people,
including Congress, are being told.
   This is no way to run a war.
   Right now, the New York Times estimates, the U.S. has
about 50,000 Marines, 50,000 soldiers, three naval battle
groups, and 250 aircraft involved in Operation Desert Shield
in the Gulf. Add in the cost of 50,000 reservists who will be
joining in, and you get a war that is costing America, by
estimate of the Times, about $32 million a day.
   For $32 million a day, the government should tell us
what's going on. There is no reason -- there is no excuse --
for this kind of censorship in this undeclared and undebated
war. It is understandable why the government would want to
keep secret the most sensitive strategies of a war, but this
censorship in Saudi Arabia -- a censorship of facts, not of
plans and strategies -- exceeds even the most stringent
censorship of World War II.
   Further, it's a continuation of a trend that has been
clearly established by the Reagan and Bush administrations.
The press was shut out of Grenada, cooped up in Panama, and
put on the late plane into Saudi Arabia.
   At the moment, this huge buildup of men and machines has
the support of the American people and of the young men and
women who are being dispatched. That's the understandable
first blush of patriotism, the instinct to rush in and get
the bad guys. If the war goes on, though, all that will
change: The troops will tire of the war -- the boredom of
waiting or the horror of fighting -- and Americans will tire
of its costs.
   Only one thing can change this: facts.
   And right now, at least, that's the one weapon the
Pentagon has no use for.

   Technology:
   Japan Pursues LCD Screens With Passion

   OSAKA, Japan -- As technological breakthroughs go, strides
in computer screens may seem to be a mundane matter. But to
some in Japan, it's gripping stuff.
   In a 20-page comic book published in May by a Japanese
business magazine, Sharp Corp. scientists sweat over
microscopes, and demanding executives pound on their desks as
the company rises to leadership in liquid-crystal displays
(LCDs), a key ingredient in shrinking personal computers into
popular laptops.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company's first real-life derring-do comes in October.
At a plant near its headquarters here, Sharp will begin mass
producing the specialized color LCDs that are likely to
become the industry standard in the next five years.
   Other major Japanese electronics companies are transfixed
by Sharp's progress. Toshiba Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and NEC
Corp., among others, plot their own strategies. For many,
only semiconductors will take up more of their research and
production budgets. "In terms of importance to the {computer
system,} our executives say the {1990s equivalent of the DRAM
chip} is LCDs," says Takashi Shimada, the top engineer in
Toshiba's electron tube and device group.
   Japan's rush into technology's latest commercial frontier
is good news for consumers seeking smaller computers. But for
some Americans, it's cause for concern. In Washington
yesterday, the International Trade Commission ruled
unanimously that U.S. producers are being hurt by imports of
Japanese thin-panel displays. That was in response to a July
petition by seven small U.S. companies trying to enter the
market. They accused Japan's 12 electronics giants of
"dumping" -- selling the screens in the U.S. at prices below
their production or home-market prices -- to monopolize the
market.
   Yesterday's ruling means the U.S. Commerce Department will
continue investigating the allegations, which cover imports
valued at more than $90 million a year, and will issue its
own preliminary ruling by Dec. 26. An affirmative decision
could result in stiff duties on imports.
   To many analysts, however, U.S. companies would have a
tough time jumping in, regardless of Japanese behavior. The
advent of a new generation of LCDs, they say, is a stark
illustration of the slippery slope of dependence that starts
when a country forsakes critical technologies. In the 1980s,
Japan virtually chased the U.S. out of the basic memory-chip
business, as well as many of the peripheral-equipment
markets. That may come back to haunt the U.S. industry. The
same techniques used to make chips and printers are the keys
to making LCDs.
   Indeed, International Business Machines Corp. opposes the
dumping petition, claiming that no U.S. producer has been
able to meet its needs for LCDs. The U.S. computer maker, in
a joint venture with Toshiba, is the only major U.S. computer
company currently entering the business.
   U.S. computer companies don't make their own conventional
screens now. But as a mature product, the standard cathode
ray tubes (CRTs) are commodities, readily obtainable from
many different suppliers. That's not the case with
sophisticated LCDs. They will be available mainly from Japan
for the foreseeable future, and U.S. companies shouldn't
expect easy access to those supplies, especially while
capacity is limited and the technology is still being
perfected.
   "It may be difficult," says Atsushi Asada, a senior
executive vice president at Sharp, "to meet demand." NEC will
only make the screens for in-house use.
   Moreover, Japanese screen makers may have an incentive to
withhold the new LCDs, which started going on sale a few
months ago. The Japanese companies are increasingly making
the computers as well as the screens, turning them into
competitors of the U.S. companies that they are supplying.
   This could be very bad news for U.S. computer makers. The
laptop market, which is already dominated by the Japanese, is
the fastest-growing segment in the computer industry. Andrew
Grove, the outspoken chief executive officer of Intel Corp.,
a leading microprocessor maker, predicted to reporters in
June that the growth of portables would help Japan pass the
U.S. as the world's largest computer maker by 1992, taking
42% of the market.
   The principles behind the LCD screen were first discovered
by RCA Corp. in 1963. Liquid crystals, when charged with
light, line up parallel to the electric field. The crystals
can be manipulated either to block light or to let it pass
through, thus creating images.
   Big U.S. companies failed to pursue practical
applications, but the Japanese, most notably Sharp,
persisted. In 1973, Sharp sold the first LCD-screen
calculator. The technology quickly spread to a number of
other small consumer appliances, such as wristwatches.
   LCDs had certain limits, however: they had to be kept
small, could only work in black and white, and were slow to
respond. In recent years, the technology has improved enough
to work in laptops, with the 27-millimeter-thick,
10-inch-diagonal LCDs replacing bulky CRTs, which are seven
centimeters thick by comparison. But the screens still can be
slow and difficult to read.
   Now that the breakthroughs are starting to appear,
however, the major Japanese makers are investing heavily.
Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd.'s Tokyo office, in a report
published in December, estimated the Japanese will spend
roughly 350 billion yen ($2.44 billion) in the next three
years to build LCD plants.
   Many different LCD approaches exist, but most of the
companies have turned to a technology called active-matrix,
thin-film transistors. A black-and-white screen requires only
a matrix of wires, with the intersecting dots controlling the
image. But crossing wires are too imprecise, especially for
color. So the companies are making screens with a separate
transistor for each dot with the appropriate use of primary
color filters to create the desired color. The production
techniques are similar to semiconductor manufacturing, using
clean rooms, thin films of material and sophisticated
etching.
   That approach is fraught with problems, most notably that
the quality requirements for LCDs are much higher than for
semiconductors. One bad dot in a million can ruin a screen.
The Japanese press estimates that as much as 80% of the
current output gets scrapped. That means the best target for
cost per screen at the end of next year is still a pricey
200,000 to 300,000 yen, according to Sharp's Mr. Asada. His
goal is to cut that to 50,000 yen to 80,000 yen in five
years.
   But the Japanese makers are confident of success. The
industry estimates, according to Jardine, that LCDs will take
more than half the PC display market by 1995. That would be
$12.5 billion in revenue, or the equivalent of nearly
one-third the total Japanese consumer electronics output.
   The makers also are looking beyond computer displays to
put their LCDs in a range of new products, such as automobile
navigation systems, high-definition TVs, and optoelectronic
computing. Those companies that dominate the LCD technology,
analysts say, will likely have the edge in those markets,
too.

   U.S., in Bid to Lift
   Price of Wheat,
   To Refill Reserves

   WASHINGTON -- Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, in a
move to prop up sagging wheat prices, ordered the refilling
of a special wheat reserve for providing emergency food aid
to developing countries.
   The move was seen here and in the commodity markets as an
attempt to partly compensate U.S. farmers for the loss of
wheat sales to Iraq, which had been a major buyer of U.S.
commodities before the Persian Gulf crisis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Currently, the so-called food-security reserve contains 60
million bushels of wheat, as compared with its statutory
maximum of 147 million bushels. "It is prudent to replenish
the reserve with higher wheat stocks due to a bumper {U.S.}
wheat harvest," Mr. Yeutter said yesterday.
   The Agriculture Department hasn't yet decided how much
government-owned wheat to put into the reserve Sept. 28. It
depends on how much uncommitted wheat is on hand. The
Agriculture Department also sets aside surplus wheat for
domestic distribution and the overseas Food-for-Peace
program.
   "There is a reasonably good chance that we would have
enough uncommitted wheat to fill it," Mr. Yeutter said.
   He and other Bush administration officials have been under
political pressure from wheat-state lawmakers to take steps
to boost wheat prices that have been depressed by the
prospect of bumper wheat crops throughout the Northern
Hemisphere, including the Soviet Union, and a record world
harvest of 584 million tons.
   "It's a positive step," said Rep. Dan Glickman (D., Kan.).
"It's the first sign of recognition on their part that they
need to put a floor under this {wheat} price, and for
humanitarian reasons, they need to put more wheat in the
reserve as well."
   In trading at the Kansas City Board of Trade yesterday,
the wheat contract for September delivery fell five cents a
bushel to settle at $2.72. Similarly, wheat took a four-cent
drop on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Mr. Yeutter acknowledged that the refilling of the
reserve, which had been drawn down during the drought years
of 1988 and 1989, will be "more symbolic than substantial"
for the markets, but it should still be "a plus."
   He said that the department "has to do other things" to
find customers for U.S. wheat and shore up wheat prices. The
department is willing to subsidize the sale of 11.3 million
tons of wheat this year to 40 countries under the Export
Enhancement Program, but so far "we just haven't had many
takers," Mr. Yeutter said. "Potential buyers are waiting for
the market to fall further."
   The administration is trying to counteract what he calls
the French government's "incredibly aggressive attempt to buy
market share" by selling wheat at $92 to $94 a metric ton
with subsidies ranging as high as $120 a ton.

   NEW YORK -- Roger L. Werner Jr. resigned as president and
chief executive officer of sports cable channel ESPN to head
Prime Ventures Inc., a regional sports network company newly
formed by cable executive Bill Daniels.
   Mr. Werner, 40 years old, was considered one of the most
promising young executives at Capital Cities/ABC Inc., which
runs ESPN and holds an 80% stake in the cable channel. A
successor will be named shortly, said Herb Granath, ESPN's
chairman and the president of ABC Video Enterprises. ESPN's
No. 2 executive, Steve Borenstein, may be the likely choice.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A former consultant with McKinsey &amp; Co. who had advised
ESPN in its early days, Mr. Werner joined the channel in 1980
as a vice president of finance and rose through several
promotions before jumping over to a sister unit, the ABC
television network, to become executive vice president there.
He returned to ESPN as its new president two years ago.
   Mr. Werner leaves ESPN a cable powerhouse, with 56 million
subscribing households and pretax earnings that topped $100
million last year. But the sports channel faces declining
profits this year because of expected losses of $20 million
or more on the first year of a new ESPN baseball contract,
and additional losses expected on a new football contract.
   ESPN officials said, however, the sports channel will post
ample profits this year, though earnings will be down from
1989 levels.
   Mr. Granath said Mr. Werner's departure was his own
choice. "We're very much chagrined to see him leaving, though
ESPN is in good shape," Mr. Granath said.
   Mr. Werner was lured to the new venture by Mr. Daniels,
the chairman of cable company Daniels &amp; Associates, with a
generous offer that Capital Cities/ABC couldn't afford to
match.
   "Bill Daniels made a sensational offer, and I decided to
take him up on it," Mr. Werner said yesterday in a telephone
news conference. He wouldn't reveal whether his new job
includes equity in the venture, but he said, "I do have a
substantial upside opportunity in growing the business. I
look forward to being an entrepreneur again."
   Prime Ventures Inc. will oversee a variety of
sports-oriented properties controlled or minority-owned by
Mr. Daniels. They include six regional sports networks owned
and operated by Daniels and Tele-Communications Inc., the
nation's largest cable operator.
   Mr. Werner's new post also will oversee a national sports
programming service called Prime Network; Prime Ticket
Netowrk, which operates in southern California and Hawaii and
is the nation's largest regional sports network; minority
interests in Home Sports Entertainment in Dallas and Houston
and regional sports channels elsewhere; and Daniels's
majority ownership of production company First Auto Sports
Television, and Denver Grand Prix Auto Race Inc.

   Preliminary census figures are beginning to confirm the
belief that the centers of political power have tipped.
Altogether, California, Texas and Florida may pick up 14
congressional seats, while New York, New Jersey and
Massachusetts lose ground. We pick the latter three because
each is in the process of significantly raising taxes to
cover public outlays that they won't reduce. It is an
interesting spectacle to watch the political culture of these
prominent states operate in apparent obliviousness to
potential losses both of fleeing residents and of political
importance.

   SERVICE FIRMS strain for an edge in a dicey economy.
   Seminars and books on customer satisfaction mushroom as
consumption cools. "We got complacent, fat and sassy," says
Larry Dirrim, head of the International Customer Service
Association. Mature technology also forces firms to stress
service in order to get a leg-up on competitors, says
Eberhard Scheuing, a marketing professor at St. John's
University in Jamaica, N.Y., who has written a book on the
subject.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When in doubt, many consult. CareerTrack, Boulder, Colo.,
says its customer-service seminars will draw more than
100,000 clients this year -- five times 1988 attendance. In
New York, Audits &amp; Surveys Inc., more than doubles "customer
satisfaction" visits, to 250,000. The firm rates speed,
smiles, smells and the like. But ICSA's Mr. Dirrim cautions
that consultants alone won't do the trick. He says the
service message "has got to come from the top."
   A University of Michigan professor creates an index --
first used in Sweden -- to rate national customer
satisfaction.
                                                                                                       

   BUT WHO COOS "IT'S YOU"? Fashion "magalogs" pick up some
slack.
   As retailers cut back, designers make house calls through
hybrid catalogs that ape fashion magazines. Anne Klein II
prints advice from top designer Louis Dell'Olio. JH
Collectibles sends super model Cindy Crawford calling. A Big
Theme: family. Nautica shamelessly slides a copy of
Impressionist Mary Cassatt's "Maternal Caress" across the
page from a sweater ad. Ralph Lauren's Polo for boys follows
little troopers through Yosemite (before the fires) as they
learn about brewing pine-needle tea, hooking trout and
spotting birds. Polo omits prices, includes seed packet.
   Does it work? Bloomingdale's Francey Smith says floor
traffic jumps after a mailing. Gayle Miller, head of Anne
Klein II, explains: "You don't walk in and drop $1,000 on a
few pieces of merchandise without knowing how to put it
together." AK II prints 8.5 million catalogs to help madame
decide. Retailers usually pay for mailings, but results are
tough to gauge. Shoppers using retailers' toll-free 800
numbers bypass sales floors.
                                                                                                       

   MANY NFL TEAMS hold the line on already high ticket
prices.
   About half the NFL teams plan increases at the gate this
fall: The hottest teams charge the most, while losers stay
put. Fans of national champion San Francisco '49ers hand over
$30 -- 20% more than last season. But the now-dismal Chicago
Bears hold steady at $27 for sideline and $24 for end-zone
seats. With only one win last year, the Dallas Cowboys keep
tickets at $25 and $19. A bargain: $7.50 bleacher seats at
Detroit Lions games.
   Television revenues help insulate turnstile prices.
Broadcast contracts add $32 million to each team's budget
this year 00 nearly double last year's $17 million. A Denver
Broncos spokesman says the team would have been hard-pressed
not to raise prices without the TV funds. With an 11-5 record
last year, the Broncos still charge $30 for best seats.
Pittsburgh Steelers charge a flat $20 price for the third
year in a row.
   A beer at a Philadelphia Eagles game costs $4 -- nearly
double other arenas. Proceeds help pay for security.

   PUPILS NOW, platinum later? Hungry banks court student
business.
   New York's Chemical Bank gives away the Sony Walkman at
campuses while Ohio's Banc One lures the student body with
pizza coupons. At the University of Texas in Austin, local
banks set up booths to "rush" newcomers. "It boils down to
building a customer base as early as possible," says Paul
O'Connor of Student Bankpak, an AmeriTrust unit. Packages
often include checking (some free) and savings accounts,
automatic teller machine and credit cards. Indiana University
students outnumber townies in Bloomington, where Banc One
rolls out the Hoosier account after a popular Boilermaker
version at Purdue University.
   Financial-aid offices are key information toeholds for
banks -- Princeton's compiles local bank terms for students
-- but proximity is the biggest draw. "Without a branch on
campus it's hard to communicate," says Ralph Jordan of tiny
Tompkins County Trust, in upstate New York, which recently
bumped Norstar from the popular ATM spot in Cornell
University's bookstore. Bank of Boston rests on the laurels
of its many academic neighbors as students pour into its
Harvard Square branch.
   A Chemical Bank survey finds only 3% of 200 polled schools
have ATMs.

   Flurry of Magazines in Los Angeles Aim
   To Defy Nationwide Advertising Slump

   LOS ANGELES -- Like the tangle of highways in this
eclectic city, the market for magazines for and about Los
Angeles is headed for one big traffic jam.
   Major media companies staked out their piece of turf years
ago with such mainstays as Los Angeles, owned by Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., and American Express Publishing Co.'s L.A.
Style. But now a plucky group of independent magazines --
some new, some revamped -- have set sights on the city, with
an editorial focus as narrow as a single neighborhood or as
broad as the California state of mind.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   BUZZ, a monthly magazine aiming to be hip, literary and
upscale all at once, will make its debut in early October.
The Brentwood Bla-Bla, one of two quirky monthlies that
publish solely what readers send in, is stepping up its
distribution in the area since being acquired last month by
Page Group Publishing Inc. Exposure, a funky pop-culture
monthly bought recently by Capital Cities/ABC, will soon get
a cleaner look and national distribution.
   But Los Angeles already may have reached a saturation
point in local magazines. The new flurry of publications will
test the limits of the local advertising market and could
overwhelm readers. Through July of this year, a half-dozen
California city magazines, ranging from Palm Springs Life to
San Francisco Focus to the granddaddy, Los Angeles, have been
hit with ad-page losses, according to Media Industry
Newsletter.
   Publishers worry that planned cuts in defense spending
could push the region into a recession and make things even
tougher for the magazines. Los Angeles's sprawling, divergent
urban mass has prevented existing magazines from building
massive circulation, yet starting a new city magazine here
can cost $5 million to $10 million, as much as it takes to
launch a small national magazine. Another hurdle: Tony
national magazines lured by the city's image are moving in on
the locals' domain.
   Industry executives say Los Angeles publishers need only
look east to see the pitfalls of a crowded market. In the New
York area, a local recession and bad times in retailing have
depressed ad spending, resulting in the shutdown of a few
magazines -- Seven Days and Manhattan inc. among them -- and
falling ad pages at many. American Express's New York Woman,
though critically praised, is down 23% in ad pages through
June, and even News Corp.'s perennially healthy New York
magazine is down 14%.
   "The lesson of New York is very clear," says Thomas Ryder,
president of American Express Publishing Corp., which bought
L.A. Style in 1988. "If you have too many magazines in one
city, you will see a bloodbath and people will lose
millions."
   Moreover, in virtually every part of the country, city and
regional magazines are being hit hard by declining retail
advertising. But publishers such as BUZZ President Eden
Collinsworth say Los Angeles is "underserved" by magazines
and that the publications can share the wealth by appealing
to distinctly different audiences.
   The market could quickly become overserved, however,
because virtually every existing magazine and most of the new
and revamped independents have the same target: the West
Side, comprising the largely affluent, yuppified communities
of Malibu, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Brentwood and Bel
Air.
   "BUZZ wants to attract a highly creative, artistic
audience -- but so do many publications," says W. Pendleton
Tudor, chairman of the executive committee of A/S/M
Communications, Inc., which publishes Adweek.
   Despite the lessons of New York, magazine executives say
Los Angeles is a city headed in another direction, and they
want to catch the momentum. "The center of gravity is
shifting in the country," says BUZZ's Ms. Collinsworth. "Los
Angeles has become a terrifically confident metropolitan
center, and there's room for a new magazine that reflects the
new reality."
   No longer the second or third city to New York, Los
Angeles can now boast of being the country's top retail sales
market and the fastest-growing major city. The Getty Museum
and industrialist Armand Hammer are both building museums
here. Earlier this year, the Los Angeles Times, flagship
paper of Times Mirror Co., passed the New York Daily News as
the country's largest metropolitan daily. And the
much-thumbed-through Zagat Restaurant Survey has declared
that Los Angeles has bypassed New York in serving the world's
most imaginative restaurant food.
   Though no one magazine has dominated, Los Angeles is the
most established, with paid circulation of more than 170,000.
Started in 1960, it took 13 years to become profitable. With
readers heavily concentrated on the affluent West Side and
scattered through assorted valleys, it continues to struggle
with the urban sprawl that is modern-day Los Angeles.
   "Communities have developed their own urban identities;
they don't look to downtown L.A. as the center," says Geoff
Miller, publisher of Los Angeles. "That makes it hard to find
the shared values that create a loyal readership."
   Los Angeles takes the broadest, middle-of-the-road
approach. It used the innocuous TV star Bob Newhart on the
cover of its recent dining guide issue. (Exposure, by
contrast, preferred for a recent cover a jarring photo of a
rock singer from the band Jane's Addiction; he wore a ring
through both nostrils and had been spray-painted platinum.)
   Los Angeles offers a foolproof mix of upbeat service
articles on restaurants and real estate, and some, but not
much, serious journalism. It is the biggest monthly city
magazine in the country, but circulation is flat and hasn't
grown much since tripling in the 1970s to 150,000.
   The magazine's mainstream approach has left room for
others. BUZZ, whose tag line is "The Talk of Los Angeles,"
hopes to draw a more affluent, in-the-know readership with a
more literary publication.
   Stationed in a classic '50s-modern house designed by Los
Angeles architect Richard Neutra high atop Mulholland Drive,
Ms. Collinsworth and a small staff have assembled a troop of
"name" writers whose Hollywood connections make them
celebrities in their own right. Columnists include
screenwriter Harlan Ellison and Holly Palance (daughter of
actor Jack Palance). BUZZ has already drawn ad commitments
from national advertisers such as Absolut, Guess? jeans, and
Estee Lauder.
   For something farther out on the edge, there is Exposure,
a three-year-old monthly acquired in January by the Fairchild
Publications unit of Capital Cities/ABC. It started as a
streetwise nightclub magazine for the hip Melrose area and
became ever slicker, monitoring popular culture and focusing
on fashion while also running stories on racism, censorship
and other social issues. As part of its push for Exposure,
Fairchild will sell ad space in the magazine in a package
with the company's fashion publications.
   Other magazines are targeting other geographic or
special-interest niches. L.A. Style, largely a fashion
magazine, will clear a profit this year for the first time in
its five-year run. Angeles magazine, focusing on interior
design, is distributed free to affluent neighborhoods. L.A.
West focuses on travel, local environmental issues, and home
and garden, and is distributed free to homes on the West
Side.
   The most offbeat magazines are two written by readers: the
Brentwood Bla-Bla and Beverly Hills, the Magazine. Both were
acquired in July by Page Group Publishing. Readers send in
poems, reminiscences, restaurant reviews, wedding
photographs. But the contributors are getting more famous.
Photographer Scavullo recently contributed shots of famous
celebrities to Beverly Hills.
   Despite the local crowd, several New York-based magazines,
most notably Vanity Fair, have targeted Los Angeles as
fertile ground to build circulation. G. Douglas Johnston,
publisher of the Conde Nast Publications Inc. property, says
Los Angeles provides 13% of Vanity Fair's national
circulation of 750,000, not far behind the 16% sold in New
York.
   But others are pulling back. Bud Knapp, chairman of Los
Angeles-based Knapp Communications Corp., recently killed
plans for a weekly regional magazine in Los Angeles. Mr.
Knapp, publisher of Architectural Digest and Bon Appetit,
says the publication was dropped because of the high costs of
start-up and "the state of our economy, now and projecting
forward." He adds: "Like everything in life, starting a new
magazine is a matter of good timing."

   The Mideast isn't the only place where a voracious force
spent the past few years advancing in the face of
half-hearted containment measures. Here at home, the same
script applies to budget items such as the federal
student-loan program. In fact, we've reached the point where
hostilities can't be avoided. Let war come.
   This is a cost-of-good-intentions story, an example of how
our political system decides to "help" some group without
much caring that these grandiose public commitments breed
waste, fraud and abuse.

<TEXT>
   Student loans ballooned during the Carter years, then
continued to grow in the 1980s because the Reagan
administration preferred them to grants. They attracted some
marginal students and any number of marginal operators of
instructional facilities who preyed on the conscientious and
careless alike, sometimes by offering empty programs or by
simply going out of business after tuition was paid. (Many of
the bad apples are proprietary trade schools.) Loan defaults
continue to rise rapidly in dollar terms (more than $2
billion this fiscal year) and soon should account for about
half the cost of the program.
   Beginning with the publication in 1985 of a list of
schools with the highest default rates, the Education
Department has been trying to get a grip on this problem.
Secretary Lauro Cavazos weighed in more than a year ago with
what amounted to a series of circuit breakers to prevent
institutions prone to abusing the program from getting away
with as much. The measures have taken time to be phased in,
and even though several hundred actions have been filed we
don't yet know whether the regulations have teeth. Overall
default rates actually had begun to stablize even before
those reins were put on, but the money being lost per bad
loan keeps increasing.
   Judges have balked at letting Education summarily shut off
a school's loan pipeline. To deal with one court ruling,
Secretary Cavazos earlier this month requested "emergency"
powers to withdraw funds where evidence exists that schools
are soliciting students under false pretenses. The emergency
must await a 45-day comment period.
   The administration also is now attempting to attack the
student end of the problem, with legislation that would limit
eligibility to borrowers who are by some stretch of the
imagination credit-worthy. Top Democrats in Congress, for
whom student loans rank as entitlements, will have none of
that.
   Meanwhile, the budding insolvency of one of the
intermediaries in the government's loan-guarantee process,
the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, has forced new
attention on the issue. Opinions vary on whether HEAF brought
on its predicament by aggressively amassing a risky loan
portfolio or just was unlucky in its draw, but its loans
apparently will be placed with another such insurer. These
guarantors are pivotal to the program -- in fact, the
Education Department relies on them for information about
loan-volume surges that might warn of trouble at the schools.
The federal government is, of course, the backup guarantor.
   The student-loan fiasco is merely a part of the huge
fiscal mess spawned by government credit guarantees. (In the
S&amp;L case, loans were backed by insuring the deposits that
funded them.) Two lessons should be drawn.
   First, and in the short run, insured loans should be sold
in the securities markets and whatever loss is realized on
them, because of credit or interestrate risk, should be
accounted for now and not be allowed to swell in the dark.
   Second, because no system of controls is going to be fully
effective in checking the greed of those who see profit in
government largess, Washington should quit thinking it can
manage these huge programs. It just can't. Where it is
determined politically that aid should be given to recipients
such as struggling students, they should be handed vouchers
by which they can purchase credit enhancements or interest
write-downs, which can be priced like any other financial
good or service.
   The budget battle of 1990, taking place in the context of
a weak and anxious economy, is a time for truth. Congressmen
who live the lie of unlimited resources should be called to
account. And the next time the public is being sold a new
federal program, such as student loans or subsidized health
care, it should look further down the road at the odds of an
expensive crackup.

   New Patent
   Shakes Up
   Chip Firms

   Semiconductor makers went into a frenzy this week when
word spread that the U.S. Patent Office had granted a
far-reaching patent covering many of the electronics
industry's most lucrative chips.
   The patent recipient, they learned, was little-known
Gilbert P. Hyatt, a 52-year-old divorced inventor living
alone in La Palma, Calif. If it survives challenges, his
patent could drain hundreds of millions of dollars from
chip-company coffers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The patent could also turn chip-industry history on its
ear. Mr. Hyatt applied for a patent in 1970 that covered his
invention of what he says was the world's first
microprocessor, the type of chip that now plays the role of
central commander in tens of millions of computers around the
world.
   But Ted Hoff, a former Intel Corp. engineer, is generally
considered to be the inventor of the microprocessor. Intel
commercially produced the first microprocessors in 1971. If
Mr. Hyatt is able to enforce his patent, which covers a
technology he said he invented in his living room in 1968, he
could demand royalties from big microprocessor makers such as
Intel and Motorola Inc.
   Chip companies refused to say what the impact of the
patent would be or if they planned to contest it. An Advance
Micro Devices Inc. spokesman said the company's lawyers had
just learned of the patent, which was granted July 17. A
Texas Instruments Inc. spokesman said the company had a
policy of not commenting on other people's patents.
   Intel said its lawyers are studying the scope of the
patent. "We respect valid intellectual property claims," said
an Intel spokeswoman. "There's been no notification of any
infringement on a patent."
   Chip-industry officials had one thing in common: No one
seemed to know who Mr. Hyatt was. "He's very obscure," said
Michael Slater, editor of Microprocessor Report, a closely
read newsletter. "I've never heard of him before."
   Even Mr. Hyatt's publicist, Charles McHenry, conceded he
knows little about his client. "He's very private," said Mr.
McHenry. "A classic techno-nerd: Give him the beanie and
propeller and he'd be right there."
   Mr. Hyatt said his obscurity was planned. "I've kept a low
profile because I'm a little guy who's very vulnerable to the
big companies," he said in a phone interview.
   Mr. Hyatt's story plays like many other Silicon Valley
garage-shop legends. After working for several Howard Hughes
companies and Teledyne Inc. in the early 1960s, he formed a
company called Micro Computer Inc. to develop computer
technologies. Using a bedroom in his Los Angeles ranch-style
home as an office, he set up soldering irons and other
laboratory equipment in his living room, where his wife
helped him wire together "breadboards," the prototypes that
chip makers create to test their ideas.
   There, Mr. Hyatt said, he came up with the idea of
combining various computer circuits on a single sliver of
silicon to make what is known now as a microprocessor. In
1970, after he had received venture capital and moved his
company out of his home, he began what was to be an arduous
20-year process of patenting his invention. The patent office
repeatedly rejected his applications, asking for proof that
he had solved certain thorny problems, such as how to wire
tiny transistors together on the chip.
   Since his company folded in 1971, Mr. Hyatt has funded his
private research by consulting for the aerospace industry,
helping companies develop computer systems that track
missiles, find enemy submarines and aim signals at
satellites. Still, the pending chip patent "has been a
continued financial and time drain," said Mr. Hyatt. "It's a
real relief to have it now . . . and it should help correct
historical events."
   Whether chip-industry heavyweights will concede his
version of history isn't clear, because chip companies aren't
talking. Patent lawyers familiar with the case say it's too
early to tell how Mr. Hyatt will be able to enforce his
patent. Intel and others have a track record of fighting
fiercely to protect their chip-making rights, and a
protracted court battle could ensue.
   "It's hard to know what a fundamental microprocessor
patent like this will cover," said Peter Courture, an
intellectual-property lawyer with the Palo Alto, Calif., firm
of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, who works with chip
companies. "But there's one thing I can guarantee: A lot of
companies will fight it tooth and nail."
   Wall Street didn't react strongly to the news, with
analysts saying that they hadn't figured out what impact the
patent would have. Intel and Motorola stocks closed down
slightly, while Texas Instruments and National Semiconductor
Corp. stock prices rose.
   What chip makers will probably do is search for "prior
art," evidence that work done before Mr. Hyatt's invalidates
his patent, said Mr. Slater, the newsletter editor. "There
was a lot of simultaneous independent invention going on" in
the 1960s, he said. "There are many ways to attack a patent."
   Mr. Hyatt said he expects to gain royalties, but added
that "I'm not a litigious type of person." He said he is
forming a joint venture with a large U.S. company with a chip
division to take care of licensing his patent. Mr. Hyatt said
he plans to use royalties to fund inventions to add to the 50
patents he already holds on various technologies, including
computers and liquid-crystal displays.
   "The patent is a basic one, the royalty rates will be low,
and I don't think it will be a problem," Mr. Hyatt said.
   The chip industry has a history of disputes over basic
patents that could set a precedent for how Mr. Hyatt's patent
is treated. Two inventors, Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby, each
claimed for years to have invented the first integrated
circuit. The patent office eventually ruled that it was a
joint invention.
   Texas Instruments has recently cashed in on some basic
patents it has had for decades. Analysts estimate that it
collects about $100 million a year in royalties from Japanese
and Korean companies for a basic memory-chip technology. And
last December, TI was granted a patent in Japan for the basic
integrated-circuit technology, a patent that analysts say
could bring TI $150 million to $650 million a year.
   Whether Mr. Hyatt can expect royalties approaching TI's is
unclear, lawyers said. "This looks like a credible claim,"
said Willis E. Higgins, a Palo Alto chip-patent lawyer. The
Los Angeles law firm representing Mr. Hyatt is very good, he
said, but "he could end up getting out of this patent
anything from nothing to many millions of dollars."

   "You're now in the middle of one of the toughest military
missions in modern memory."
   -- President Bush, Aug. 29

   A DESERT AIR BASE, Saudi Arabia -- As President Bush
delivered his first message to the troops yesterday, the men
in Sgt. William Barrett's tent were listening to heavy-metal
rock tapes and trying to keep the blowing sand out of their
eyes.
   For them, as for many U.S. troops here, it is now a
waiting game. The long, sleepless frenzy of unloading planes
and setting up camp is over. As the confrontation between the
U.S. and Iraq heads into a diplomatic phase, the crucial
issue may be which side can best endure what Mr. Bush called
the "long, hot days of the Gulf region's cruelest month."
   Boredom now looms as the worst enemy. "We just sit around
and try to keep up each other's spirits," says 24-year-old
Sgt. John Hensley of Fayetteville, N.C.
   Sgt. Hensley plays a major role as morale-booster because
he has brought along his cassettes. He also has taught his
companions a trick that not only is useful but also for a
time was the troop's chief form of entertainment. The
soldiers wrap plastic water bottles -- which are ubiquitous
here -- with gauze. Then they wet the gauze, which is secured
to the bottles with shiny duct tape, and set them out on the
runway. There, in the 120-degree heat, the desert wind chills
the bottles through the magic of evaporation.
   The half-dozen men in the tent, all mechanics for their
unit's tank-killing A-10 jet fighters, must spend 12 hours a
day on the flight line. As the wing's maintenance crew during
alerts, they must be ready to prepare the planes --
affectionately known as "the Hogs" -- for what could be one
of the first battles of war.
   Col. Sandy Sharpe, commander of the 354th Tactical Fighter
Wing, which flew here from its home in Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
worries about what boredom can do to his troops. "They're
ready right now to do their job," he says. "I don't think any
of them want to sit around for six weeks."
   But sit around they may. That's why the tremendous
logistical support the U.S. forces are receiving -- from the
U.S. and the Saudis -- may become decisive in the Persian
Gulf showdown.
   The support is beyond what the U.S. has had in any
previous war. For example, the mail service here borders on
the supernatural. When Sgt. Barrett arrived a week and a half
ago, this was a largely empty airstrip, built oversized -- as
many Saudi projects were -- for distant future needs. But
already, Sgt. Barrett has received five letters from his
wife.
   Portable showers have been installed. Soon there will be a
laundry, a daily hot-meal service and a 500-bed tent
hospital. As visiting reporters left this base, a line of
flatbed trucks carrying portable outhouses was seen heading
north toward the border.
   A city of air-conditioned tents has been erected here for
sleeping. The Saudis pay the energy bills, and when they
heard the airmen were sleeping on cots, they came up with a
supply of thick mattresses.
   Tonight, the long-awaited MWR -- for morale, welfare and
recreation -- tent will be ready to show movies from the U.S.
   Most of the men and women here have never seen combat.
Col. Sharpe, who saw action during the later stages of the
Vietnam War, says the relative handful of veterans remaining
are mostly senior unit commanders.
   Out on the runway, the long row of twin-engine A-10s have
never fired a shot in battle either. They are painted dark
green, designed to blend into the shrubbery of Central
Europe. The planes' fuselages are built around large machine
guns whose uranium-tipped bullets can stitch Soviet-made
tanks.
   "We'll be right there when their boys meet our boys," says
Capt. James L. Baldwin of West Monroe, La., one of the
pilots. "We'll be right over them at a couple of thousand
feet."
   As far as is known here, the Iraqi soldiers who have dug
into the table-flat desert over the Kuwaiti border have very
little in the way of creature comforts.
   "They fought Iran for eight years, but they never had
supply lines this long," says one Saudi official. "They have
made sure there is very little left in Kuwait, so their lines
must go back to Iraq."
   Meanwhile, the stiff breeze off the desert flaps the roof
of Sgt. Barrett's tent, and the midday sun makes the A-10s so
hot that the mechanics must work with gloves on. "We can hang
out as long as it takes," Sgt. Barrett says.

   Brazilian Arms Experts Said
   To Upgrade Iraq's Missiles

   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Among the foreigners reportedly being
held in Iraq are Brazilian weapons engineers who may have
been aiding Baghdad's missile capabilities, according to
officials and individuals familiar with their activities.
   Their presence, which highlights Brazil's once close
commercial ties with the regime of Saddam Hussein, is a
"political embarrassment" to Brazil at a time when it is
firmly supporting the economic blockade of Iraq, Foreign
Minister Jose Francisco Rezek has said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Brazilian officials acknowledge the engineers' presence in
Iraq, but contend they were operating without the
government's knowledge and say they have no specific
information on their activities.
   "We don't have knowledge of the project," says Foreign
Ministry spokesman Jose Vicente Pimentel. "The Brazilians are
there on a strictly private basis." But Mr. Pimentel says the
"very special treatment" the group apparently enjoyed,
including luxurious but isolated living conditions, could
indicate a military project of some importance to Iraqi
authorities.
   Brazilian press reports say the group was helping Iraq to
develop a short-range missile, possibly based on the Piranha
air-to-air missile that Brazil unsuccessfully sought to
develop, and to improve the performance of Iraq's Soviet-made
Scud ballistic missiles. There is also speculation that the
group was helping Iraq develop an earth-orbiting satellite
with military applications, and a rocket launcher. How far
these projects have advanced isn't clear.
   Brazilian officials say that until recently Brazilians
were free to work in Iraq, but they should now comply with
Brazil's adherence to the embargo imposed against Iraq, cease
their work and leave the country. But there hasn't been any
response to Mr. Rezek's appeal to their "patriotism,"
officials say.
   "Brazilians, including retired military {officers}, are
civilians like any others {and} have the right to work
wherever they want," says Aeronautics Minister Socrates
Monteiro. "But at a time when the Brazilian government is
proclaiming its support for the United Nations-sponsored
economic blockade against Iraq, Brazilian citizens are
obliged to comply with this blockade."
   The group, said to total about 23 engineers, is apparently
headed by retired Maj. Brigadier Hugo de Oliveira Piva,
former director of Brazil's Aerospace Technology Center. The
engineers are said to have been in Iraq for several months.
Other foreign engineers, possibly Soviet, French and Chinese,
were believed to be working on the same project.
   Individuals familiar with Brazilian and Iraqi military
research doubt that the project was carried out without the
knowledge of Brazilian authorities because of Mr. Piva's high
rank. "It's conceivable that the government is right, but it
seems implausible to me that Piva would go and embarrass his
government to help Iraq with its missile technology," says
Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear
Arms Control, which tracks chemical, nuclear and missile
development in the Third World.
   At the Aerospace Technology Center, according to David
Dantzic, a researcher at the Wisconsin Project, Mr. Piva was
in charge of converting the Sonda IV, Brazil's latest space
rocket, into a missile large enough to carry a nuclear
warhead, and of secretly making nuclear weapon material by
enriching uranium. Since his retirement, Mr. Piva has headed
an engineering consulting firm called HOP (after his
initials) and based in Sao Jose dos Campos, near Sao Paulo.
Repeated telephone calls to HOP's offices and to Mr. Piva's
home were unanswered. According to Mr. Pimentel, Mr. Piva was
recently in Iraq, but Brazilian press reports quote friends
of Mr. Piva saying he is in Europe.
   While officials say Mr. Piva -- described by one magazine
as a "Brazilian Werner von Braun" -- has the right to market
his scientific abilities, the newspaper Jornal do Brasil
commented that passing on information about the Piranha
missile, whose development Brazil abandoned for lack of
funds, would "constitute a serious case of espionage." Maj.
Teles Ribeiro, a spokesman for the Aeronautics Ministry, says
he doubts the Piranha would interest Iraq because it's very
similar to the Sidewinder, a U.S. missile that Iraq could
already have obtained.
   The engineers' presence in Iraq once again focuses
attention on Brazil's controversial defense program. In only
two decades, Brazil has become the Third World's largest arms
maker and exporter, but has roused ire in Washington because
of what the U.S. considers indiscriminate selling to
countries, such as Libya, that are linked to international
terrorism. Also, Brazil's failure to sign either the nuclear
nonproliferation treaty or the Missile Technology Control
Regime has led to suspicion that it has a program to produce
nuclear-weapons material.
   Last summer, West German documents suggested that Brazil
was using for military purposes West German nuclear
technology acquired for the power industry, and was reneging
on some inspection terms. Brazil denies that such diversion
is taking place. More recently, the Washington-based Council
on Hemispheric Affairs and the Wisconsin Project charged that
efforts by Embraer, a Brazilian aerospace company, to
purchase an IBM supercomputer should be blocked because
Brazil could use the computer to develop -- and disseminate
-- nuclear-weapons technology. And two weeks ago, Wisconsin
Project officials warned that Brazil could use rocket motor
technology it is acquiring from a group of European companies
to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile.
   But Mr. Pimentel, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, denies
the allegations. "We're the bad guy that on top of burning
rain forests also sells arms to Iraq," he says. "But this bad
guy hasn't sold arms to Iraq in two years and hasn't even
sold spare parts for a year because Iraq doesn't pay. We were
one of the first countries to say we would stick to U.N.
resolution 661 despite its economic costs."
   Indeed, until Iraq's economic difficulties, it enjoyed a
profitable relationship with Brazil. Until the embargo,
Brazil imported up to 160,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day. It
paid for some of the oil with Brazilian goods. Among other
things, Jornal do Brasil recently alleged, Brazil's previous
military government provided Iraq with a small quantity of
enriched uranium.
   During the Iran-Iraq war, Brazil sold Baghdad about $3
billion of hardware, including armored vehicles, tanks,
rocket launchers and ammunition. Iraq's financial straits
after the war were a major reason why two of Brazil's largest
armsmakers, Avibras Aerospacial S.A. and Engesa, filed for
protection from creditors this year.
   But the Kuwait crisis could revitalize the troubled arms
industry. Engesa hopes to sign a $2 billion contract to
supply Saudi Arabia with heavy armored vehicles.

   We Saudis
   No Longer Belong
   In OPEC

   As part of their strategy to confront Saddam Hussein, the
Saudis have committed themselves to boost their oil
production to make up, at least partially, for the losses
resulting from the international boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti
oil. Before it did so, Saudi Arabia felt that it needed the
approval of OPEC.
   Although it obtained that approval yesterday, this need to
seek foreign approval for acting in the Saudi national
interest at a moment when Saudi Arabia is facing what might
be the greatest challenge in its modern history, should make
it clear that OPEC, from a Saudi perspective, has outlived
its usefulness -- if it was ever useful to Saudi Arabia at
all. To protect its vital interests, which happen to coincide
with those of the world at large (including the developing as
well the industrialized countries), Saudi Arabia should leave
OPEC.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Multinational oil companies once enjoyed great discretion
to decide where oil was produced and in what quantities. The
fact that many oil producing regions were under colonial rule
greatly enhanced oil company power. OPEC was created in 1960
by Venezuela, Iraq and Saudi Arabia as a counterweight to the
power of the multinational oil companies. The founders of
OPEC hoped to enhance their bargaining position by
negotiating with the companies jointly.
   These hopes were disappointed, despite the powers that the
mass media and sanctimonious politicians have attributed to
OPEC. It is probably correct to say that the emergence of
OPEC restrained the oil companies somewhat and impelled them
to pay more attention to the interests of their host
countries. But the crucial events in the subsequent history
of oil had very little to do with OPEC.
   Specifically, the success of the producing countries in
increasing oil prices and wresting control over production
levels from the oil companies were effected essentially
independently of OPEC. The rise of oil prices prior to the
Arab oil embargo in 1973 was the result of favorable market
conditions and the quirky nature of Libyan politics.
   When Col. Gadhafi seized power in Libya in 1969, he took
advantage of tight oil supplies of the "sweet" -- low sulfur
-- oil that Libya produces to play one oil company against
the other. Rises in Libyan oil prices naturally led the other
countries to demand equal treatment. OPEC made little
difference.
   OPEC was even less relevant to the truly revolutionary
developments in the fall of 1973 when the producing
countries, once and for all, gained control over production
levels and prices from the oil companies. It was the Arab oil
embargo that achieved these results. OPEC again had nothing
to do with it.
   With the producing countries making the decisions that oil
companies had once made, OPEC became irrelevant as a
collective bargaining agency. It took on, however, a new
mission in the 1980s: enforcing oil production quotas to
prevent oil prices from dropping. These efforts have
basically proven unsuccessful. Whatever results were achieved
were realized because Saudi Arabia sacrificed its own
interests and held its production far lower below capacity
than any of its OPEC partners.
   As the largest oil producer in OPEC and the possessor of
the largest reserves in the world as well, Saudi Arabia had
to assume the leadership of OPEC. But instead of offering
Saudi Arabia a vehicle to protect its national interest, OPEC
proved to be an instrument in the hands of its adversaries to
impose undesirable constraints upon Saudi decisions.
   The national interest of Saudi Arabia is obvious: stable
and reasonable oil prices. Oil prices should never be allowed
to rise to the point where energy alternatives become so
economically competitive as to displace oil. Saudi Arabia is
a one-resource country. It needs to market its oil for as
long as it lasts, which will be a long time.
   Other countries, with bigger populations and smaller
reserves, have different interests. And these countries have
often sought to use OPEC to impose their goals on Saudi
Arabia. In the 1970s, the Shah of Iran led the pack; today it
is the unholy alliance of the Ayatollahs and Saddam Hussein.
   It was these other interests that had begun to prevail
even before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The July OPEC
meeting agreed to raise the price of oil to $21 a barrel.
This was a clear threat to the Saudi interest in maintaining
the competitiveness of oil. After the turmoil of the early
1980s, oil prices collapsed and so did the demand for OPEC
oil. It took a long time for oil prices and consumption to
recover, but by the late 1980s the trends were encouraging.
Saudi Arabia could increase its income by boosting production
while maintaining the lower prices.
   Iraq and Iran, unable to increase output, advocated a rise
in oil prices. The July meeting, had its outcome not been
made obsolete by Iraq's military move, put Saudi Arabia in a
position where it would have had to choose between its own
interests and obeying an OPEC edict.
   In light of this discouraging history and to deprive its
enemies of whatever levers they enjoy under the OPEC
umbrella, Saudi Arabia should simply walk away from OPEC.
OPEC might be retained as a harmless but useful "trade
association" to collect information and publish oil
statistics. But Saudi Arabia should no longer permit it any
policy-making power.
   Saudi Arabia is the superpower of oil. With this status
come challenges and responsibilities -- challenges and
responsibilities that Saudi Arabia is fully capable of facing
without the OPEC cover.
   The Middle East is a nasty neighborhood with armed thugs
on the loose. We cannot do much about that, but the Saudis
owe it to themselves (and to the world) not to be exploited
by those thugs through the mechanism of OPEC.

   Bank Reviews Loan
   Made to Partner
   Of Auditor Firm

   GLEN ROCK, N.J. -- Citizens First Bancorp Inc. said it met
with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, its outside auditor, to "review the
circumstances" of loans to a Coopers partner that are in
default.
   Citizens and Coopers declined to name the partner, specify
the size of the loans or indicate when the default occurred.
But, raising questions about a potential conflict of
interest, Citizens said in a statement that Coopers, which is
based in New York, "will promptly take a special in-depth
review" of its audit work and the partner's involvement.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The partner wasn't directly responsible for auditing
Citizens' financial statement but acted in a secondary review
capacity, the statement said. The loans, from the Citizens
First National Bank of New Jersey unit, were not in default
at the time.
   Coopers "remains confident that its audits were properly
conducted and that Citizens' financial statements are fairly
presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles," the statement said.
   Rodney Verblaauw, Citizens' president, said in an
interview that the bank had provided for the unsecured
portions of the partner's loans as part of a $70 million loan
loss provision taken in the second quarter. He termed the
personal loans in question "inconsequential in terms of the
overall picture," saying they amounted to "no more than"
several hundred thousand dollars.
   Citizens, the holding company for the 51-branch bank unit,
reported a net loss for the second quarter of $34.5 million
because of the $70 million loan loss reserve. For 1989, the
company reported earnings of $37.1 million on revenue of
$289.3 million. Its assets totaled $3 billion at July 31.
   Pending completion of the Coopers investigation, due
within two weeks, Mr. Verblaauw said he wasn't concerned "at
this time" about a conflict created by the partner's loans.
   Accountants and their clients usually take great care to
avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Professional
standards typically prohibit accountants from holding an
ownership interest in an audit client, and certain other
business relationships -- while not forbidden -- must be
undertaken with caution, said John C. Burton, a professor of
accounting at Columbia Business School and former chief
accountant with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In the case of an accountant holding loans from a bank
whose audits he oversees, Mr. Burton said "it might be more
sensible to borrow from someone else to avoid the appearance
of impropriety."
   "If there is any business relationship between the partner
and the client, it would create an independence problem," Mr.
Burton said. "Then there would be a question of whether the
audit was an independent audit."

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. urged
Kansas Gas &amp; Electric Co. to meet with its officials before
entering talks with any other potential buyers.
   Kansas City P&amp;L last month launched an unsolicited
$27-a-share, or $857 million, tender offer for the Wichita
utility. But Kansas G&amp;E rebuffed the offer as inadequate and
overly conditional, saying also that the bid "raises
substantial and serious legal questions and numerous
uncertainties under state and federal statutes."

   Earlier this week, Kansas G&amp;E disclosed in a Securities
and Exchange filing that it might consider a merger or
recapitalization plan as a means of foiling its unwanted
suitor.
   In a letter made public yesterday, Kansas City P&amp;L
President and Chief Executive Officer Drue Jennings told
Kansas G&amp;E Chairman and President Wilson K. Cadman: "We are
concerned that KG&amp;E's statement indicates that you may enter
discussions with third parties without also engaging in
discussions with us."
   Mr. Jennings urged: "Let's meet before you take any steps,
such as agreeing to substantial commitment and other fees or
agreeing to merge with, or sell significant assets to, a
third party."
   Kansas City P&amp;L's offer has been extended until Sept. 14;
at the time the original expired Aug. 20, about 43% of Kansas
G&amp;E's common shares had been tendered.

   The U.N., a Wobbly House of Cards

   In the days since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the United Nations
has acted with greater promptitude and cohesion than at any
time since the Korean War. Within 48 hours the U.N. Security
Council issued a resolution condemning the invasion,
demanding that Iraq withdraw, and invoking comprehensive
Chapter VII sanctions. Even more striking is the most recent
resolution authorizing member states to use minimal force to
enforce the sanctions. Even rogue states like Libya, Syria
and Iran have supported the U.N. actions and declared that
they will respect them. Armed with this universal solidarity,
the U.N. secretary general will meet with Iraq's foreign
minister today, leading some to hope that the U.N. will
provide an escape route from war.
   It is probably fair to say that the U.N. has never before
in its history looked more like the peacekeeping,
order-preserving institution it is supposed to be. Many
observers ascribe this to the apparent end of the Cold War.
There has certainly been an unprecedented degree of Soviet
cooperation with the Security Council's actions. But the
superpower conflict hasn't been the only, or, in many cases,
the main, obstacle to an effective U.N. response to regional
threats to peace.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In fact, the Korean War is a good example of a tough U.N.
response against the wishes of the Soviet Union. Of course,
at the time the U.S. dominated the world scene. This nation's
relative power combined with the strong support of Western
Europe and the Latin American countries to give us an almost
automatic majority in the U.N. bodies. In the Korean case
this led to circumstances in which we could even circumvent
the Soviet veto on the Security Council.
   As Europe's colonial empires in Africa and Asia collapsed,
however, U.S. domination of the U.N. gave way to domination
by a new majority composed mainly of developing countries --
the so-called Third World. This majority has since determined
the issues that dominated the U.N.'s political agenda. Two
components of the majority, the Africans and the Arab states,
proved most effective at promoting their preoccupations,
South Africa and Israel, to the top of the U.N. agenda.
Beyond these regionally determined priorities, an
anti-colonial and leftist ideological thrust superficially
united the Third World majority. This gave the Soviets some
advantages in advancing their anti-Western agenda through
U.N. institutions.
   To see how destructively this arrangement has worked, it
helps to look at the numbers. A Heritage Foundation review of
voting patterns during the U.N.'s 44th General Assembly
(September-December 1989) shows that the rest of the world
voted the same way the U.S. did an average of only 17% of the
time. The average overall coincidence of voting with the
Soviet Union for these countries was by contrast 95%. On
Middle East questions, the rate was about the same. Some 94%
of U.N. members supported resolutions 44/40 A and 44/42,
which condemned Israel for being "terrorist" and "aggressive"
and called for Israeli withdrawal from "occupied
territories."
   Long before last fall, once it became clear that we could
no longer dominate its decisions, the U.S. ceased to take the
U.N.'s politics seriously. It seemed easier for us to use our
great power unilaterally, or to take advantage of the
superiority in bilateral relations that our global economic
dominance made possible.
   As a result, the U.N. ceased to be a viable instrument for
pursuing U.S. policy goals. Yet the Third World majority that
dominated its decisions had no effective power to translate
decision into action outside the U.N. In this sense the
great-power veto on the Security Council merely reflects
reality. Without involvement and support from the great
powers, the U.N. can't do much more than talk. The necessary
but not sufficient condition of its effectiveness is the
support, indeed the leadership, of a nation powerful enough
to add meaningful economic and political muscle to its
actions. The Third World majority can provide the chassis for
the U.N. vehicle. The great powers, and especially the U.S.,
must provide the engine.
   The U.N.'s remarkably cohesive response to Iraq's
aggression reflects a set of circumstances that have at least
temporarily pushed aside the factors that have rendered the
U.N. impotent. In the context of the Soviet Union's apparent
collapse in the Cold War competition, the U.S. has, for the
moment, emerged again in a position of undisputed global
preeminence.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait posed an immediate threat to
Saudi Arabia, whose wealth and quiet political skills have
made it a very influential player among Arab countries. Other
traditional or more moderate Arab regimes (Egypt and Morocco,
for example) also feel the shadow of this threat, while the
leaders of the radical states (such as Libya and Syria) don't
want to see Saddam Hussein achieve the Nasserite position of
dominance in Arab politics that will result if his bold move
against Kuwait succeeds. Given Iraq's regional military
dominance, and the Soviet Union's current weakness, the U.S.
represented the only power with the wherewithal to respond to
Iraq's move in time to forestall an Iraqi takeover of Saudi
Arabia.
   A combination of regional self-interest and U.S. readiness
have created an opportunity to fashion a coalition of support
for prompt, and even forceful, U.N. action. The Soviets are
in no position to oppose this coalition (which has some of
the same elements as the one that repeatedly secured passage
of resolutions in the General Assembly against the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan). In fact, since a prolonged crisis
in the Gulf will increase U.S. eagerness for continued good
relations, the Soviets have an interest in encouraging
international action -- with the U.S. in the lead role. Given
the importance of Middle Eastern oil to their economies, the
Europeans and the Japanese clearly have an important stake in
making sure that supplies are not disrupted, or permanently
controlled, by an Arab power less susceptible to their
influence than the Arab monarchies.
   It would be a mistake to believe that the U.N.'s ability
to deal with the Gulf situation means that the organization
itself has suddenly overcome its inherent structural and
political deficiencies. The organization is not a catalyst or
agent of events, it is more like a barometer. Its present
role reflects a certain state of existing interests and power
relations in the world. At the moment, those interests and
relations have allowed the U.S. to reassert the strong
leadership role that allowed the U.N. to take decisive action
in the early years of its existence. What we are witnessing
therefore tells us more about the current pre-eminence of the
U.S. than it does about the U.N.
   Even with that insight, we should be wary of concluding
that the U.N. has now become a routinely reliable instrument
for U.S. policy. The self-interest of certain Arab states
combined with our readiness and Soviet weakness have made the
current moment possible. The key factor, in U.N. terms, is
majority support in the Arab bloc. Even in the present crisis
it is not hard to envisage a change in that support over
time. If Saddam Hussein can foment anti-American,
anti-Western feeling among the Arab masses, this might weaken
the resolve of the vulnerable moderate and traditional
governments that are the core of the coalition that supports
our presence and forceful action in the region. Weakness at
the Arab core would give rise to European vacillation and
doubtless affect the Soviets' calculations about the wisdom
of being too positive in their cooperation with the
international effort built around U.S. power.
   We should also bear in mind that at some point this
situation may become the precedent for actions less consonant
with U.S. interests than at present. Will we someday find
ourselves called upon to acquiesce in an effort built around
Soviet military power (which still exists, by the way,
despite current Soviet preoccupations that discourage its
use), aimed at South Africa or Israel, with an African or
more radical Arab majority at its core? The U.N. remains a
highly politicized arena, in which -- for the moment --
global and regional circumstances favor our leadership.
Circumstances can change, however. Rather than betting on
naive theories about a fundamental reform of the U.N.'s weak
character, we should constantly remember that there can be no
substitute for our own prudence, diplomacy and decisiveness.

   With Saudi Oil Fields Secured, Bush Now Needs
   To Define Long-Term U.S. Objectives in the Gulf

   KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine -- When a somber President Bush first
went before the nation to announce the dispatch of troops to
the Persian Gulf, he could offer a simple, clear rationale:
Saudi Arabia's giant oil fields were threatened by Iraqi
troops sweeping through Kuwait, and the loss of those fields
would pose "a major threat" to America's economy.
   In the three weeks since then, Mr. Bush has succeeded in
securing the oil fields, and in gathering an impressive show
of international condemnation for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But now the president is running into real problems
articulating and selling the administration's broader goals
in the Gulf crisis -- goals such as the restoration of the
emir of Kuwait, an objective that will be tough to achieve
and difficult to sell to Americans unaccustomed to fighting
for unelected monarchies.
   "I think the president has been better with deeds than
with plans or words, at least as they're expressed," says
Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.). "I don't know what the
mission is fully expected to be."
   Whereas oil once seemed the overriding American
consideration, Mr. Bush recently gave a 25-minute speech
about the Gulf crisis to the Veterans of Foreign Wars without
once mentioning the word "oil." He stressed instead more
idealistic goals such as stopping Iraq's "assault on the very
essence of international order and civilized ideals."
   Mr. Bush has often compared Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to
Adolf Hitler -- yet in a meeting with lawmakers this week he
didn't say that removing him was an American goal. Privately,
other officials worry that whoever follows Saddam Hussein
might be even worse.
   And the president has made little of what some analysts
and politicians think may be the most powerful argument for
challenging Saddam Hussein: The likelihood that this crisis
could set the tone for the whole international order in the
post-Cold War period.
   "I think that they have done quite well in saying Saudi
Arabia asked us to come and we went and this was all part of
a collective effort," says William Quandt, a Carter
administration Middle East adviser now at the Brookings
Institution. "Where I think they have been a little more
careless is in not having made enough of a point, which I
think people understand pretty readily, that . . . in this
crisis, we have the chance for laying down the ground rules
for some time ahead."
   The administration's difficulty in articulating a clear,
long-term mission in the Gulf seems to arise because the
president and his aides aren't sure how aggressive they want
to be. In a radio address to armed forces yesterday, as in
all his prepared remarks since the crisis began, Mr. Bush
talked of four goals: forcing an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait, restoring the Kuwaiti government, ensuring the
stability of the Persian Gulf and protecting Americans
abroad.
   There was a flurry of reports yesterday that the
administration had turned down feelers from Iraq on
negotiations. In fact, the White House said, an official of a
past U.S. administration had broached some ideas for a
solution. But it was unclear whether they were his own or
represented a formal overture from Baghdad, and the White
House said there was "nothing in this particular proposal
that merited its pursuit."
   Some analysts worry that Mr. Bush may have created
long-term problems for himself in setting one of those four
goals, the restoration of the ousted emir of Kuwait. Even
among Arabs that deplore Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Kuwait's
ruling al Sabah family wasn't very popular, and Americans are
more comfortable if they can be told they are battling for
democracy rather than royalty.
   Yet now if Mr. Bush accepts anything less than restoration
of the Kuwaiti emir as part of a negotiated deal with Iraq,
he would be seen as having failed to achieve one of his
fundamental goals -- and in the process would unsettle the
ruling royal family in neighboring Saudi Arabia. Mr. Bush
seemed to waver on this goal this week, saying in passing
that whether the wealthy ruling family remains in power is "a
matter for the Kuwaitis to decide."
   Beyond that, administration officials are torn by the idea
of going well beyond the stated goal of forcing an Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait and using the current crisis as an
excuse to get rid of Saddam Hussein and destroy his ominous
chemical and nuclear weapons programs.
   Officials worry that the U.S. could bite off more than it
could chew in the Gulf by adopting grander and grander goals.
The administration is sobered by memories of the Korean War,
when the U.S. tried to go beyond simply protecting South
Korea and ended up bogged down in a long war that succeeded
only in preserving the status quo.
   And while the idea of using the big American military
force against Iraq is tempting, the administration also
realizes that current Arab support for the international
campaign against Saddam Hussein could shatter as soon as
American bullets begin killing Arab soldiers.
   So Mr. Bush at the moment is saying, in essence, that
he'll leave a big American army and armada in the region
while he waits for international economic sanctions to force
Iraq out of Kuwait. And in the meantime, he's willing to give
others' diplomatic efforts a chance, but he doesn't see much
hope in them.
   As Congress begins returning to Washington from its August
recess, that position leaves the administration open to
complaints from two sides -- from those who want to go much
further and those who fear the administration may yet go too
far.
   "The president needs to formulate our goal in terms of
eliminating the military capacity of Iraq," said Sen.
Lautenberg after meeting with Mr. Bush Tuesday. "That is a
clear policy." Similarly, Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, one
of the Republican Party's most influential lawmakers on
foreign policy, flatly declared that Saddam Hussein poses
such a long-term threat to the Gulf that "he does have to
leave the leadership of the country, and beyond that, many of
the forces that he has aggregated have to be removed as a
threat."
   By contrast, Nebraska Democratic Sen. Robert Kerrey
declared in a television interview over the weekend that "the
only justification that I find legitimate" for dispatching
American forces to the Gulf was preventing an invasion of
Saudi Arabia. "I question a response that says that we're
going to go there and have our young people die so that we
can have cheap oil here at home, or cheap gasoline here at
home," he said on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press."
   And in fact, the administration at one point seemed to
flirt with using cheap oil as one reason for putting American
soldiers in the line of hostilities. President Bush declared
to a Pentagon audience that "our jobs, our way of life, our
own freedom and the freedom of friendly countries around the
world would all suffer if control of the world's great oil
reserves fell into the hands of that one man, Saddam
Hussein."
   But such a rationale undermines support for the U.S. even
among friendly Arabs, because it implies that the U.S. is
interested only in grabbing Arab oil and not in the region's
other political or economic problems. And some lawmakers
report that, even among Americans, the oil argument isn't
persuasive; some voters would rather pay a few cents more for
a gallon of gas than risk having their sons or daughters
killed in combat.
   As long as the Bush administration has "stayed on the high
ground of opposing aggression in one form or another, they're
in good shape," says Richard Murphy, who was the State
Department's top Middle East diplomat during much of the
Reagan administration. "When you start talking about our way
of life . . . it causes you a hell of a problem with the
American public because they don't think Americans should be
shot at for $18, $20 or $21 dollar-a-barrel oil."
   The administration seems to be on the verge of crafting a
more sophisticated argument in which it can call the American
military deployment a significant success even if Saddam
Hussein remains in power in Baghdad.
   Officials are starting to contend that, however this
crisis ends, the U.S. will have so radically altered the
political ground rules in the Persian Gulf that Iraq will be
contained and American friends protected against further
aggression. The U.S. will have set a precedent for rapidly
intervening to protect Saudi Arabia, and might well leave
behind significant stockpiles of military equipment and
perhaps some American Air Force personnel to guard the Saudi
kingdom. And at the same time, the argument goes, other,
smaller Gulf oil states have moved further under the American
defense umbrella as a result of the crisis, making them less
vulnerable at the same time.
   That argument may well have broad appeal -- but so far, it
isn't one President Bush has made publicly.

   Green Cross Certification Co. said it issued the first
independent environmental seal of approval indicating that
products meet a specific standard, such as 100% recycled
content.
   Green Cross said that as a first step, it certified the
recycled content of more than 50 paper products, plastic bags
and fire logs distributed nationally by six manufacturers.
The products will have a label containing the Green Cross
seal, and a specific explanation -- such as "made from at
least 80% recycled plastics."

<TEXT>
   Green Cross, a division of Oakland, Calif.-based
Scientific Certification Systems Inc., a
food-and-product-testing concern, said the labeling program
should promote recycling and help clear up confusion over
environmental marketing claims. The label won't mislead
consumers because it verifies only the accuracy of specific
claims and avoids vague product endorsements, such as
"environmentally friendly," said a spokeswoman.
   However, consumer advocates and some companies caution
that Green Cross could increase confusion by adding to the
proliferation of competing and conflicting environmental
labels. Another group, Green Seal Inc., for example, plans to
issue seals of approval next year for products that reduce
waste from manufacture through disposal. Some also warn that
comparisons could be unfair if competing labels use different
definitions for "recycled content" or other standards.
   Green Cross said it issued certifications to 40% recycled
content paper grocery sacks made by Portland, Ore.-based
Willamette Industries Inc.; 100% recycled paper napkins,
toilet paper and tissues made by Portland, Ore.-based Pope &amp;
Talbot Inc., LaPalma, Calif.-based Orchids Paper Products
Co., and Irvine, Calif.-based Confab Cos.; 50% and 80%
recycled plastic trash bags made by Peabody, Mass.-based
Webster Industries Inc.; and 100% recycled fire logs made by
Hillsboro, Ore.-based Green Fields Inc. Green Cross says it
will expand the program to glass and additional plastic
products.
   Most of the companies are smaller producers hoping to
increase sales and market shares by promoting an
environmental advantage over major brands. "The certification
helps establish credibility with consumers," says a
spokeswoman for Pope &amp; Talbot, a maker of private-label paper
products.
   Julie Vergeront, special assistant Minnesota attorney
general, says Green Cross should help consumers make informed
choices, provided that claims are clear and accurate. She
said competition from niche products could force major brands
to increase their recycled content.
   Green Cross says it independently verifies claims and
charges manufacturers only the actual cost, which ranges from
$1,000 to $10,000. The program is currently being promoted in
four West Coast grocery chains; Green Cross says this will
soon expand to chains in the East and Midwest.

   McDonald's Tests a Diner
   With New Bill of Fare;
   Burgers Aren't a Big Hit

   HARTSVILLE, Tenn. -- McDonald's Corp. is testing a 1950's
style diner concept in this archetypical small-town U.S.A.
   Called the Golden Arch Cafe, the one-of-a-kind restaurant
features such traditional fare as pork cutlets, mashed
potatoes and cole slaw. There's also waitress service, a free
jukebox, movie posters on the walls and a nickel Coke
machine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's intentions for its version of the diner -- a
restaurant format enjoying something of a renaissance --
aren't clear. The company opened the Golden Arch Cafe with
only local fanfare in this town of 2,674 some 50 miles from
downtown Nashville.
   While McDonald's has experimented in recent months with
pizza, fried chicken and spaghetti in an effort to bolster
dinnerhour sales, this time the world's biggest fast-food
concern is trying out an entirely new type of restaurant.
   Same-store sales at McDonald's restaurants have slumped in
the past year, yet analysts were surprised at the company's
latest move. "While it makes some sense, I would question
whether this {concept} is something you could really build a
business around," said Michael G. Mueller of Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco. Although he said such
restaurants are attractive to an aging population, "you have
to wonder whether nostalgia is a fad or not."
   The company chose Hartsville for its prototype, an
official told the local newspaper, because it wanted a town
of 2,500 to 3,000 people with no other traffic generator.
   Early reviews from patrons of the Golden Arch are mixed.
They're delighted that the fast-food giant chose Hartsville
for its test -- but some residents say they don't
particularly like the hamburgers it serves.
   "The worst comments I've heard are about the hamburgers,"
says Kathy Atwood-Gammons, editor of the local newspaper, the
Hartsville Vidette. "Everybody thought they'd be like
McDonald's, but they're not."
   But the cafe's French fries fare better. They're exactly
like the ones available at the nearest McDonald's -- 19 miles
away, says Rosemary Denham, the newspaper's office manager.
   The Golden Arch opens at 5:30 a.m. and normally closes
about 9 p.m. but plans to stay open late Friday nights to
accommodate post-football game fans. It also will operate
Sundays, when most other restaurants in town are closed. The
cafe also has drive-thru window service, perhaps to compete
with the local Sonic hamburger-chain outlet.
   Reminiscent of the real thing, the McDiner's menu includes
hearty country breakfasts, sandwiches and Salisbury steak
platters with a vegetable-of-the-day at $2.99 for lunch, and,
after 4 p.m., catfish dinners. Local residents say ribeye and
sirloin strip steaks also are planned. Desserts include
banana splits, sundaes and pie a la modes.
   Patrons must order at a counter, but are served the food
by waitresses, who bring it on china instead of paper plates.
   "This is real exciting to us," says Ms. Atwood-Gammons.
Since a nuclear plant project was scrapped here more than a
decade ago, Hartsville business people have been trying to
recruit new employers. "We've had our economic problems," the
editor says.
   Apropos of small-town hospitality, other local merchants
sent bouquets of flowers when the Golden Arch opened Aug. 20.

   Israel Still Must Talk to the Palestinians

   TEL AVIV -- If there is no certainty that economic and
diplomatic sanctions will dispose of Saddam Hussein, the same
is true of a massive air strike. I was a member of a
government that decided on a very successful air strike
against Nasser in 1967, but he remained in office and his
armaments were replenished within six months.
   The Gulf situation today has no quick fix. If the U.S. is
not prepared for phased action and perseverance in pursuit of
its declared aim, it cannot hope for success. The anti-Saddam
coalition will be more likely to endorse armed action if it
is proposed after exploring the slender prospect of success
by watertight quarantine. And if armed force is to be
effective either as a deterrent or as a means of ultimate
sanction, it must be, and appear to be, invincible. Thus both
the advocates of military action and those who believe,
however skeptically, that blockades and interdiction will
suffice have an objective interest in a patient attitude to
time.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, the foreign media have done Israel no service
in portraying it wrongly as a source of agitation for
impatient courses. Conspicuous unobtrusiveness is not a
familiar Israeli posture, but in this case it has its own
logic. The task of resisting major international aggressions
must be carried on shoulders broader than ours. Israel's role
consists in an increase of vigilance, a serene and
unprovocative projection of its strength -- and clarity in
defining the points at which its vital interests would be
engaged. All this has been well accomplished in a mood of
bipartisan understanding between the major elements in the
Israeli parliamentary system. If there have been occasional
strident departures by individuals from those limits, this
only proves that lunatic fringes are universal.
   The fact that Iraq is not contiguous to Israel is of great
importance. It means that Saddam could engage us directly
only by inaugurating a missile exchange that would expose him
to untold devastation. The other theoretical option would be
available only if he were to obtain a base for action in
Jordan. This would mean multiplying his adversaries, of which
he seems to have more than enough already, and he cannot
realistically believe that he would be able to avoid
encountering Israel far away from his own ground and from
ours.
   The paradox of Jordan is that its integrity is safeguarded
by Israel's deterrent power, not by an illusory alliance with
Baghdad. King Hussein should look westward across the narrow
river for his kingdom's safety, not eastward toward the Gulf.
His anxiety about the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza
would be more understandable if it were less self-righteous.
He is the architect of that problem through his decision to
fight Israel in 1967 and should therefore take a role in its
solution.
   Geopolitical realities are stronger than passions, and
these realities tell us inexorably that Jordanian and
Palestinian destinies have an Israeli context and are by
their very nature remote from the tumult of the Gulf.
Jordanians and Palestinians will have to rediscover the
Israeli dialogue, for they have nowhere else to look.
   The Gulf crisis is not Israel's only or main problem. It
does not weaken our national structure, our democratic
principles, our Jewish vocation, our national unity, our
economy, our society, our regional peace or our international
relations. All these are weakened by the burden of enforcing
our jurisdiction over a Palestinian population half the size
of our own, without being able to offer them civic equality
or any expression of their national identity.
   Israel is one of the 160 countries whose parliaments or
governments have never committed themselves to recognizing
the permanent legitimacy of this situation. It is therefore
encouraging to note that the suspended peace process may be
discussed next week between the U.S. and the Israeli foreign
ministers. It is tendentious to assert that peace between
Israel and the Arab states is more urgent than progress in
Israel-Palestinian relations. These two issues are
inseparable. Does anyone know the name of an Arab state that
has either the will or the capacity to discuss peace with
Israel without placing the boundary question and the status
and identity of the 1.8 million Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza at the head of the agenda?
   Secretary of State James Baker's proposal for a Cairo
dialogue with Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian participation
was the most innocuous, safest and least hazardous proposal
ever submitted to Israel by a foreign power. It had majority
support in Israel. It could lead in time to a community
structure in which Israelis, Palestinians and Jordanians
could maintain separate juridical and cultural identities
while closely integrating in all other domains. What Europe
can best offer Israel and its neighbors is the example of its
own community structure, which evolved after wars more
frequent and lethal than all the conflicts of the Middle
East.
   Saddam's squalid maneuvers must not only be resisted by
international condemnation. They must also be discredited by
competing models of national freedom, social harmony and
institutionalized regional cooperation. Only thus can Middle
Eastern nations emerge from deadlock into the movement and
impulse of the modern age.

   Fluorescent-Bulb Sales
   Become Electrifying

   SALES OF energy-saving fluorescent lightbulbs are
brightening so fast that retailers are having trouble keeping
some in stock.
   One of the most popular is a 27-watt Panasonic bulb that
substitutes for 100-watt incandescent bulbs. "We've been out
of them 90% of the year," says a spokesman for Energy
Federation Inc., Framingham, Mass., a nonprofit concern that
sells the bulbs.
   Don't expect a low price. The fluorescent equivalent of a
conventional incandescent 60-watt bulb retails for about $15.
But it lasts 10 times longer, screws into standard sockets,
casts about the same color and intensity of light and uses
only 15 watts.
   Cheaper fluorescent bulbs -- retailing for less than $10
each -- may reach the market within a year, says Amory
Lovins, research director at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a
think tank in Snowmass, Colo.
   Right now, utilities are the biggest customers of
fluorescent bulbs; they resell them to foster conservation,
which regulators are pressuring them to do. Lighting eats up
some 25% of the power generated in the U.S., and fluorescent
bulbs could cut the need for power plants costing $85 billion
to $200 billion, say Mr. Lovins and other energy researchers
in the September issue of Scientific American.
Environmentalists also tout the bulbs' potential to cut air
pollution from power generation.
   This fall, Boston Edison Co. plans to offer customers
300,000 of the bulbs at $3 each, partly door-to-door. Buyers
are also thronging lighting stores and other outlets offering
the bulbs -- even at retail price, they get back more than
their costs through lower electric bills and fewer burnouts.
   Buying the bulbs "is not a free lunch," note the
Scientific American authors. "It is a lunch you are paid to
eat."
                                                                                                       

   Solar-Power Company
   Gets Day in the Sun
                                                                                                       

   SOON AFTER Iraqi tanks rolled into Kuwait, the switchboard
lighted up at Luz International Ltd.
   The Los Angeles company is the biggest player in solar
power, and its rows of trough-like solar collectors in
southern California produce some 90% of the world's
sun-generated electricity. Now people want to know how Luz
can help ease the U.S. addiction to foreign oil, says
Kathleen Flanagan, a Luz spokeswoman.
   The answer: It can't do much. Utilities buying Luz's power
use little oil. Still, Luz could realize big gains from
higher oil prices, says James MacKenzie, an energy analyst
with Washington's World Resources Institute. Utilities burn a
lot of natural gas, and gas prices "tend to follow oil
prices," he notes.
   Thus, the Middle East crisis may close the cost gap
between Luz's power and cheaper electricity from natural gas.
And the crisis may get more congressmen to vote for
solar-power tax credits; Luz has worried that the credits
would be discontinued.
   Even before the crisis, Luz had almost caught up with the
competition in electricity pricing. In a decade, power costs
at its new installations fell to eight cents a kilowatt-hour
from 24 cents, says Ms. Flanagan.
   During the next few years, she adds, Luz expects to shave
another two cents off that, putting its power in the same
price range as conventional options -- at least in a few

   To Fuel More Cars
                                                                                                       

   AMONG THE pollution-cutting alternatives to gasoline,
propane appears best positioned to benefit from higher oil
prices.
   Unlike some other alternative fuels like ethanol, propane
hasn't needed government subsidies to compete as a vehicle
fuel. It's the most widely used alternative fuel, propelling
more than 300,000 U.S. vehicles on the road and many off-road
vehicles; because of its relatively low pollution, it's often
used in forklifts. Some 85% of propane used in the U.S. is
supplied domestically as a byproduct of oil and natural gas
production; most of the imports come from Canada and Mexico.
   Propane, used mainly for heating, is a "much-neglected"
vehicle fuel and could be substituted for gasoline faster
than other alternatives, says R.F. Webb, an Ottawa energy
expert. The facilities to convert vehicles to propane were
built up after the 1970s oil shocks and are now
"underutilized," he adds. Production of vehicle fuel based on
propane could be scaled up "without strenuous effort" to
propel about 6.5 million of the approximately 180 million
U.S. road vehicles, estimates Mr. Webb. Some 10,000 U.S.
retail outlets already sell propane as motor fuel, mainly for
trucks and other "fleet" vehicles.
   Propane's ability to cut air pollution -- especially the
ground-level ozone that plagues big cities -- may soon boost
it as a motor fuel regardless of Mideast events. Using
propane can halve vehicles' ozone production, according to a
recent study at the University of California at Riverside.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   ACCORDING TO a study by the California Energy Commission,
wind power can be cheaper than anything else in generating
electricity -- blowing away oil, natural gas, nuclear,
hydropower and coal. . . . Ten school buses powered by
pollution-lowering natural gas are expected to begin
operating in California early next year as part of a program
sponsored by state energy regulators and utilities, says
Tecogen Inc., a Waltham, Mass., concern that will supply the
buses' engines.

   Lockheed Unveils a Prototype YF-22,
   Its Competitor to Replace F-15 Fighter

   PALMDALE, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp. and two other defense
contractors displayed a prototype of their candidate in the
competition to build the Air Force's next-generation fighter
jet.
   The winner of the contest between two proposed versions of
the so-called Advanced Tactical Fighter, or ATF, eventually
would replace the aging F-15s that have been pressed into
service in the Middle East.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The first YF-22, as the new Lockheed plane is known,
wouldn't be available for use by the military until the
beginning of the next decade. By that time, both company and
Pentagon officials stress, the F-15 will be nearly 30 years
old, and many Third World nations are expected to have added
to their arsenals today's top-of-the-line Soviet fighters,
the MiG-29 Fulcrum and Su-27 Flanker. Already, 11 countries
possess the former.
   The YF-22, which Lockheed is manufacturing with Boeing Co.
and General Dynamics Corp., is competing with a YF-23 built
by Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. The Northrop
plane made a 50-minute maiden flight earlier this week,
climbing to 25,000 feet and flying at 333 miles an hour.
   "As current events demonstrate, there are those in the
world willing to test American resolve and readiness," said
Gen. Ronald Yates, who runs the Air Force Systems Command.
"That, in a broad sense, is why we need the ATF."
   In an interview, YF-22 program chief Sherman Mullin said
the fighter is tentatively set to make its first flight on
Sept. 14, but Air Force officials insisted yesterday that
they didn't want to be pinned down on an exact date. Lockheed
Chairman Daniel Tellep reiterated the company's strongly held
view that the victor on the ATF won't be "he who flies first,
but he who flies best."
   The ATF, through a unique combination of speed, agility,
range and stealthiness, is designed to take and maintain
control over enemy airspace, providing ground troops and
ships with safe room to maneuver in battle. "It will preserve
our security well into the next century," Gen. Yates
asserted.
   But, in the eyes of many lawmakers, the federal budget
deficit remains as much of a threat as potential Third World
aggressors. And at a projected $51 million per aircraft -- a
40% higher price tag than that carried by the most advanced
model of the F-15 -- it's doubtful to many that the Pentagon
will ever be authorized to buy all of the 750 ATFs that it
now says it needs. The Navy also wants its own variant of the
ATF, and currently has plans to procure 546 of them to
replace the F-14.
   The YF-22, which was presented while Wagner's "Ride of the
Valkyries" blared over a speaker system, in some respects
resembles Lockheed's F-117 Stealth fighter, with its angular
airframe. In fact, Mr. Mullin called it "loosely speaking,
the son of the F-117." With four tails and stubby wings, the
aircraft also has a far different appearance from the rival
YF-23. It is shorter than the Northrop plane, which features
a more cigar-shaped fuselage: 64 feet, 2 inches, vs. 67 feet,
four inches.
   The stakes are high for all the companies involved,
including engine makers General Electric Co. and United
Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit, with this being
seen as the Defense Department's last major airplane project
of the century that is still up for grabs. "You don't have to
be a Rhodes Scholar to see that the military-aircraft
business is compressing," Mr. Mullin said. "The loser is
going to be hit very hard."
   Still, Mr. Mullin said that even with expected cuts and
stretch-outs in the defense budget, Lockheed can foresee the
ATF generating as much as $100 billion in revenue for its
team over the years between the Air Force and Navy
requirements. "Admittedly, there is no guarantee that is
going to happen," Mr. Mullin said. "But we just can't
envision the production of 1970-era airplanes in the year
2000."
   Collectively, the industry has sunk more than $1.3 billion
into the 54-month demonstration-and-validation phase of the
ATF program, meaning that even if Mr. Mullin's rosy
assessment is correct, it would take about 10 years for the
winners just to recover their investment. Major
subcontractors on the project have contributed another $800
million or so.
   The ATF "would be a nice piece of business for us," said
William Anders, vice chairman at General Dynamics. B. Daniel
Pinick, president of Boeing's defense and space group, said
that for his company, the YF-22 "meets one of our long-term
objectives: to be a maker of tactical aircraft."
   "The reason for that is simple," he added. "If you look at
where defense dollars around the world are going, it is into
these types of planes."
   But the success of the YF-22 is clearly most important for
Lockheed. Although Mr. Tellep asserted that winning the ATF
is "not make it or break it for Lockheed aircraft
activities," the company's historic role as a major supplier
of U.S. warplanes would almost surely be threatened by a loss
of this business. Although the YF-22 roll-out ceremony at
Lockheed's factory here was at times drowned out by riveting
on P-3 aircraft, most of the company's major lines have wound
down or are slated to do so soon. In addition, the Navy
recently terminated the company's contract to build the
successor to the P-3, the P-7.

   `Talking' Baby Gimmick Moves
   From the Screen to Commercials

   One simple gimmick helped "Look Who's Talking" become a
movie blockbuster last year: The flick's star, a baby,
"talked" throughout the movie in the voice of an adult actor,
Bruce Willis. Only the audience, the twist went, could hear
the baby speaking.
   Madison Avenue thought the gag was hot, too: The
"baby-talk" device is now showing up in ads for everything
from Kellogg's Eggo waffles to Burger King sandwiches. Baby
conversations have also made their way into ads for Scott's
Baby Fresh baby wipes, Fuji Photo film and even a maternity
ward at a hospital near Boston.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "When something happens in the movies that is a gimmick,
that insidious device spreads through television commercials
like the plague," says Roy Grace, chairman of ad agency Grace
&amp; Rothschild. "There's always this terrible need for ideas.
Whenever one comes along that seems even somewhat fresh, it
has a magnetic quality."
   In the Burger King spot, a baby boy and a baby girl sit in
highchairs at the fast-food joint munching on french fries.
"So what're you doing after this?" an adult voice says as the
boy waves his arm. "Let me think. Today's Tuesday. Tuesdays I
play peekaboo," his friend answers. The two chat about Burger
King food.
   "So what did your Dad get?" the boy says, pointing.
"That's my Mom]" the girl screams. "Sorry, I still get those
mixed up," replies the boy.
   Advertising executives say the slew of "baby-talk" ads is
just the latest example of advertisers borrowing ideas from
Hollywood. In their undying bid to find ads that will break
through the clutter and get noticed, advertisers often think
using an idea from a popular film will help get consumers in
their court.
   A current Roy Rogers ad, for example, features music
resembling the theme from the movie "Jaws." Special effects
in the movie "Superman" have been mimicked by many
advertisers. And now, advertisers are using film directors
like Spike Lee and David Lynch to direct their commercials so
they have a cinematic feel. "Films are the parent of many
commercial ideas," says Robert Schmidt, chairman of ad agency
Levine, Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver.
   To be sure, the idea of using babies in ads isn't new.
Advertising executives, armed with the hunch that babies have
a strong emotional pull on consumers, have cast babies in
starring roles in commercials for years, including those for
Michelin tires, Du Pont Stainmaster carpet and Angel Soft
toilet tissue. But the popularity of "Look Who's Talking,"
advertising executives say, has put a new spin on the old
baby-in-ad formula, letting the baby speak for himself.
   Rich Swietek, a copywriter at Mintz &amp; Hoke in Boston, says
he decided to tap the "baby-talk" idea because the agency's
client, Nashua Memorial Hospital's "Birth Place," needed a
warmer image.
   "The advertising out there {for hospitals' maternity
wards} was pretty mundane, just the basic shot of the parent
and kid. We wanted to try and capture a human feeling in the
parents to try and appeal to their emotions," Mr. Swietek
says. "We decided the best testimonial would come from the
babies themselves."
   One of Nashua Memorial's ads features a baby boy "talking"
about the maternity ward's private rooms and other amenities.
"Four months ago, I was born at the Birth Place at Nashua
Memorial Hospital," an actor says as a baby's cooing is heard
on the sound track. "The nurses were great . . . even the one
I sorta spit up on."
   Despite the fact that "Look Who's Talking" is nearly a
year old -- it came out last October -- advertisers say the
concept is strong enough that people don't need to have seen
the movie for the ads to make sense.
   A planned television series on ABC based on the movie,
called "Baby Talk," has been put on hold. But advertisers say
the ads couldn't be more timely: The original movie came out
on video earlier this year and the film's sequel, "Look Who's
Talking Too," will hit theaters in December. This time, Mr.
Willis will be joined by a couple of other famous voices
playing babies: Roseanne Barr and Richard Pryor.

   CBS Considers
   Late News Show
   On Gulf Crisis

   NEW YORK -- CBS News is exploring the possibility of
producing a late-night program to focus on the crisis in the
Middle East.
   If the program succeeds, a new half-hour series produced
by CBS News could remain on the air to compete with ABC
News's "Nightline."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The show could be anchored by CBS News correspondent
Charles Kuralt. Company insiders said that chief White House
correspondent Lesley Stahl also might have a role. The
experiment began last night with a special CBS News broadcast
featuring an exclusive interview by anchorman Dan Rather with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   In an interview, Eric Ober, who was named president of CBS
Inc.'s news division last week, confirmed the plans. Talks
about a half-hour CBS News program that would be aired at
11:30 p.m. in most time zones began last week when CBS
Broadcast Group President Howard Stringer decided to remove
CBS News President David W. Burke and replace him with Mr.
Ober, who was president of the CBS-owned television stations
division.
   "CBS News is looking seriously at time periods for
expansion, and 11:30 p.m. is one under consideration," Mr.
Ober said.
   Mr. Ober declined further comment, but other people at CBS
News, who didn't want to be quoted by name, said CBS has no
firm plan for a regular nightly series at 11:30. The division
is taking a "wait and see" attitude, they said.
   CBS News's plans come as network news divisions are
devising new ways to boost revenue. For example, ABC News is
considering an overnight newscast, perhaps to begin on
Election Day in November. ABC News said it was exploring this
possibility at the request of its more than 200 affiliates.
   CBS's television network long has been frustrated in the
financially lucrative late-night arena, most recently by its
big-budget flop, "The Pat Sajak Show." With its
action-adventure shows, CBS runs a poor third behind "The
Tonight Show with Johnny Carson" on General Electric Co.'s
NBC network and "Nightline" on Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s ABC
network.
   At stake is a share of the $429 million in ad revenue
earned by the three major broadcast networks in the 11:30
p.m. to 2 a.m. period.
   It was another crisis facing U.S. citizens, the hostage
situation in Iran more than 10 years ago, that was
responsible for the creation of "Nightline." ABC News's
series of nightly reports on the 1979-80 Iranian hostage
crisis evolved into the highly respected late-night news
program.
   The ratings of "Nightline," which generally finishes No. 2
in its time period, soar when a major news event occurs. For
instance, A.C. Nielsen Co.'s ratings for "Nightline" have
climbed 27% since the Middle East situation began.
   CBS News already produces a two-hour overnight program,
"Nightwatch." When Mr. Burke was removed last week after just
two years, CBS officials said privately that he wasn't
"creative" enough and didn't "energize" the beleaguered news
division, which has suffered rounds of layoffs and budget
cutbacks since 1985.
   But individuals at CBS said that CBS News's annual
operating budget, estimated at $340 million, will increase
next year.
   CBS News had been hoping for millions of dollars in ad
revenue from a new series, "Face to Face With Connie Chung,"
which the network scheduled for one of its best time periods,
Mondays at 10 p.m.
   But last month, Ms. Chung unexpectedly canceled her own
series, and instead would like to air periodic specials,
because she wants to try to have a child. That move cost CBS
News millions of dollars, insiders have said.

   WASHINGTON -- The government's principal economic
forecasting index was flat in July, another sign that the
economy was precarious even before turmoil in the Middle East
jarred American consumers and businesses.
   The flat reading of the index of leading indicators, a
collection of 11 sets of economic statistics that are
supposed to foreshadow economic activity six to nine months
in advance, followed a 0.1% rise in June and a 0.6% increase
in May. Those figures marked slight revisions from last month
when, based on preliminary data, the department calculated
that the index was unchanged in June and rose 0.7% in May.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Only three of the 11 indicators made positive
contributions to the index last month: orders for new plant
and equipment, raw materials prices and an index of consumer
confidence all rose. The other eight -- including stock
prices, unemployment claims, factory orders and building
permits -- held the index down.
   The leading indicators are the latest in a string of
statistics that suggest the economy was in a weak position by
July. Mounting evidence of this has increased fears the
economy won't be able to survive the higher oil prices
prompted by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait without sinking
into a recession.
   "While these figures indicate that the economy was already
sluggish prior to the Middle East crisis, they do not point
to the emergence of a recession. Since this time, however,
the sharp rise in world oil prices has made a downturn almost
inevitable," said Gordon Richards, an economist for the
National Association of Manufacturers.
   Private surveys are showing that consumer confidence
tumbled in August, suggesting that people may curb
discretionary spending in the face of economic uncertainty.
That alone, some analysts fear, could tip the economy into
recession.
   Besides worries over oil prices, the country also faces
the prospect of an auto strike later this year. If that
happened, the resulting plunge in car production would almost
certainly spell recession.
   "I think we're right on the edge," said Stuart Hoffman,
chief economist at PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh. "I
really don't see any growth at all in the fourth quarter."
   But some economists don't think a downturn is inevitable.
"It's unclear how much shock this is to the economy," said
John McAuley, an economist at R.H. Wrightson &amp; Associates, an
economic consulting firm in New York. He expects continued
slow growth.
   Three consecutive declines in the leading indicators are
supposed to signal a recession, though the index is notorious
for predicting downturns that never occur. After the October
1987 stock market crash, for example, the leading indicators
fell for five straight months, but the economy continued to
grow at a healthy rate.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said sales
of new single-family homes dropped 2.3% in July following a
4.6% increase in June, which was revised from an earlier
estimate of an 8% increase. Sales fell in the Northeast and
the West but rose slightly in the Midwest. They were flat in
the South.
   Nationwide, the average price of a new home fell to
$150,500 in July from $152,100 in June. The median price
dropped to $121,000 from $127,000.
   The home-sales figures are based on incomplete data and
are often revised substantially.
   The numbers in both reports were adjusted for regular
seasonal fluctuations.

   Charles Lichenstein, then deputy U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, became a momentary folk hero seven years ago
when, during the crisis touched off when the Soviets shot
down a Korean Air Lines jet, he encouraged the world body to
leave the banks of the East River. "We'll be at dockside
waving you a fond farewell as you sail into the sunset," he
declared.
   But the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, besides upsetting the
balance of power in the Mideast, has promoted a radical
change in the views of the U.N. held by American policy
makers and others. The U.N. has won praise in recent years
for its role in brokering an end to the Iran-Iraq war and the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. For the first
time since its founding 45 years ago, however, the
organization seems poised to realize its potential, coming of
age as a formidable instrument for resolving international
conflicts before they erupt into war.

   Today, with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar set
to meet with Iraq's foreign minister in Jordan in an effort
to end the Persian Gulf standoff, even a lot of longtime U.N.
skeptics believe that the organization may have been born
again.
   "The U.N. is in exactly the kind of crisis that it was
designed to deal with: armies crossing borders," says
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a former
chief delegate to the U.N. who became known for assailing it
as a captive of resentful Third World nations.
   Yet even as the U.N. enjoys its new-found respect, there
are indications that the whiff of hope -- even romance --
surrounding the organization may not last forever. In
particular, the small nations that used the U.N. as a
platform for attacking the industrialized world may now see
the newly united superpowers using it for their own purposes,
ignoring Third World concerns.
   "When the superpowers are working together," complains
Abdullah al-Ashtal, Yemen's U.N. delegate, "little attention
is being paid to the smaller countries."
   The organization won a second chance when the Cold War
fizzled out and the superpowers stopped using their power to
veto any action benefiting the other. Suddenly the U.N. was
freed from paralysis, emerging as a peacemaking and
nation-building force around the globe.
   "The U.N. was a rusty car out in the garage that all of a
sudden someone has discovered could be driven," says Edward
Luck, president of the United Nations Association, a
nonprofit research group.
   In February, during the organization's supervision of
Nicaragua's first free elections, U.N. banners declaring that
"your vote is secret" fluttered above polling places in even
the most remote villages. After elections in the new African
nation of Namibia in April, local residents held a series of
farewell bashes for U.N. diplomats, slaughtering sheep and
cattle for the feast. Some Namibians even named their newborn
children Untag, the acronym for the U.N. Transition
Assistance Group.
   Just this week the five permanent members of the Security
Council agreed to an unprecedented plan for a truce and U.N.
administration of Cambodia until a new government is elected.
   But it was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait earlier this month
that turned all eyes toward the U.N. A series of unanimous
Security Council votes on steps to counter Saddam Hussein's
expansionism suddenly presented a picture of the world body
acting as the world always hoped it could. "If we can pull
this off we have a model . . . with the U.N . . . of how to
deal with the next half-century," Sen. Moynihan says.
   But the resolutions dealing with the Iraqi invasion reveal
important institutional flaws remaining. Regardless of how
many resolutions it passes, the U.N. by itself still doesn't
have the muscle to enforce its decisions. "It happens that
the U.S. is eager to enforce this one," says John Ruggie,
director of the University of California Institute on Global
Conflict and Cooperation. "What happens when the U.S. isn't
so eager?"
   In addition, some Americans, particularly foreign-policy
conservatives, continue to harbor grave concerns that the
U.N. remains a forum for attacking the U.S. and its economic
interests. "The danger in the Iraq crisis is that people will
say the U.N. isn't so bad after all," says Midge Decter,
executive director of the Committee for the Free World.
"People should be steadier in their enmities."
   But even the harshest U.N. critics acknowledge that the
organization has begun playing a useful role in world trouble
spots from Africa to Asia to Latin America. The U.N. is close
to completing an agreement in the long Western Sahara
struggle between Polisario insurgents and Morocco. It is
leading an effort to seek a negotiated peace in El Salvador.
In the Mideast, U.N. peacekeeping forces are stationed in
southern Lebanon, the Golan Heights, the Sinai and, standing
between hostile armies as little as 30 feet apart, on the
Iran-Iraq border.
   But the U.N. nearly didn't get off the ground at all
because of disagreements among the great powers when they met
in San Francisco in 1945 to design the organization. With
fresh memories of the failure of the League of Nations -- an
American idea that never won American membership -- war-weary
nations fought over how much power to give the big powers to
allow them to police the world.
   The Soviets insisted that each permanent member of the
Security Council -- the U.S., the Soviet Union, Great
Britain, France and China -- should have the power to wield a
veto to end any discussion, investigation or resolution. The
U.S. wanted to limit veto powers, however, arguing that only
decisions of the Security Council, not other business, should
be subject to veto.
   Harold Stassen, the former perennial GOP presidential
candidate and the only surviving member among the eight
officials appointed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to help
create the U.N., says that superpower politics dominated even
this early dispute. Mr. Stassen says that President Truman
dispatched a trusted aide to Moscow to warn Stalin that if he
didn't yield on the point, there wouldn't be a U.N. The
Soviets signed on and the U.N. was born.
   The organization, already divided between a General
Assembly in which the smaller nations could debate issues and
a Security Council where the enforcement work would be done,
was from the start paralyzed by the Cold War. Swiftly the
veto became a tool for obstruction -- and the U.N. found
itself hopelessly tangled in ideological disputes.
   "The Soviets saw any act of aggression by someone in their
bloc as an act of liberation," says Jeane Kirkpatrick,
President Reagan's envoy to the U.N. "If this were two years
ago, the Soviets and those associated with them would have
defined what Iraq did as an act of liberation."
   When Libya invaded Chad in 1983, the 15-member Security
Council did nothing. Chad's foreign minister wandered the
halls of the U.N. in his long, flowing, light-blue robes,
hopelessly in search of support. And several months later,
when Mrs. Kirkpatrick was speaking in the General Assembly in
defense of the U.S. military action on the Caribbean island
of Grenada, several delegates interrupted her remarks and
moved to end the debate. The president of the General
Assembly agreed and she was abruptly silenced.
   But in the current Gulf crisis, the U.N. has emerged as an
invaluable tool. President Bush, himself a former U.N.
delegate, understood the potential of the organization for
providing cover and legitimacy for his response to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. Without the prospect of U.N. support, he
might not have been able to persuade Saudi Arabia to accept
U.S. troops. Without U.N. action, it would have been more
difficult for an Islamic state such as Turkey to close its
oil pipelines. Without the U.N., the likelihood of Soviet
involvement in international action was slim; from the
outset, Moscow made it clear that it would not move without
the U.N.
   The administration has at some points in the current
crisis moved at a slower pace, or shown more caution, than
officials would have preferred -- specifically in order to
keep the five permanent members of the Security Council
moving in unison. For instance, Mr. Bush held off on
unilaterally enforcing the embargo. That was a deliberate
strategy chosen in hopes that this crisis could set a
precedent in which the Security Council showed it would take
concerted action against international aggressors, something
it has seldom done in the past.
   Republican Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, a prominent
foreign-policy voice in the Senate, saw vivid illustration of
the importance of the U.N. when he traveled this month to
Indonesia, an Islamic country that has joined the U.N.
embargo on Iraq. He said that officials there told him that
Jakarta wasn't interested in siding with the U.S. in the
Gulf, but was willing to join a U.N. effort. "For them U.N.
leadership gives them the umbrella they need," Sen. Lugar
says. "It offers a new option to them."
   The U.N. also won plaudits for its role in supervising
Nicaragua's elections last February, which resulted in the
surprise defeat of the leftist Sandinista government that had
ruled there for a decade. Nicaragua was the first member
nation that ever invited the U.N. to monitor an election. The
organization moved in seven months before the vote to begin
planning its supervisory activities and by election day had
nearly 200 observers roaming the country in 31 white,
radio-equipped Toyotas and power boats.
   At a rural polling place 20 miles from Managua, Rigoberto
Aguirie, waiting in the hot sun to vote, said that "the most
important thing is for people to believe that these elections
will be fair" -- and the presence of the U.N. and other
organizations provided that assurance. Officials from the
international organization tabulated a parallel vote by
sampling each polling place to test the accuracy of the
government's final tally.
   But the U.N. also has mastered some of the small details
of diplomacy that become so important in countries where free
elections are a novelty rather than the norm.
   While U.N. observers were monitoring a political rally in
Managua last winter, for example, violence erupted and
several rocks were hurled at an opposition-party vehicle. The
U.N. observers remained on the scene after the rally broke
up, taking statements from the car owners and escorting them
to local authorities to ensure that their complaints were
registered.
   "It really made a big difference," says Larry Garber, a
consultant to the National Democratic Institute for
International Affairs, an affiliate of the U.S. Democratic
Party that helps promote democracy abroad. "It increases the
confidence of people that they can participate in political
activities and cast their votes freely."

   Bush's Nominees to New Housing Board
   Face Delays Due to Dispute in Congress

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush's nominations to the newly
created Federal Housing Finance Board are being stalled by a
dispute with members of Congress over whether the positions
should be filled on a full-time basis.
   In a letter to the president last week, Senate Banking
Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich) asked Mr. Bush to
withdraw the names of the four nominees if they are unwilling
to accept full-time positions. Sen. Riegle said he hadn't
scheduled confirmation hearings because the disagreement with
the Bush administration, which wants the four to serve part
time, hasn't been resolved.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, consumer groups have called for hearings on
the nominees, particularly Daniel Evans, who is chairman of
the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis and a longtime
associate of Vice President Dan Quayle. Mr. Evans, the
Consumer Federation of America contends, may have a conflict
of interest because his law firm has represented a bank whose
parent company has acquired defunct savings and loans.
   The five-member housing finance board was created by last
year's thrift-bailout law to regulate the nation's 12 home
loan banks, which have 3,200 S&amp;L members. (The secretary of
housing and urban development is a permanent member.) The
member thrifts buy shares in the home loan banks and get
lower interest rates for mortgages.
   Chase Untermeyer, director of presidential personnel, said
the White House counsel's office is "absolutely vigilant"
about potential conflicts of interest. "They would not let
anybody out" who even appeared to have a conflict, he added.
   Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), chairman of the House
Banking Committee, argues that a part-time board "where
members maintain employment and business interests in the
private sector can be the breeding grounds for serious
conflict-of-interest situations."
   In his letter last week, Mr. Riegle also urged the
president not to give the nominees recess appointments, as
the White House has considered doing. Recess appointments are
made when Congress isn't in session and therefore can't hold
confirmation hearings. Recess appointees can hold office
until the subsequent session expires, which in this case
could be about a year.
   Mr. Untermeyer said making recess appointments is "an idea
that's in the air," but added there are no plans to make any
housing finance board appointments during the current recess.
   The Consumer Federation of America has called for the
Senate's full confirmation process to examine Mr. Evans's
relationship with Bank One in Indianapolis, whose parent
company, Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio, has purchased
thrifts in Texas, Wisconsin and Ohio. He is a partner in the
Indianapolis law firm of Baker &amp; Daniels, which has
represented Bank One. Mr. Evans also served as chairman of
the Quayle for Vice President Committee in 1988 and as
director of the vice president-elect's transition team.
   Sen. Riegle has asked the American law division of the
Library of Congress to study the part-time, full-time issue.
Administration officials say a part-time board would be able
to meet its responsibilities fully and would have the
flexibility to work as much as is necessary.
   Mr. Untermeyer, in an Aug. 13 letter, told the consumer
group that the administration believes part-time members
could "fully discharge the important responsibilities given
it." Part-time status would allow them to work as much as
needed, including every day during some months, he said.

   Citicorp Forges `Global Bonds' With Credit-Card Link

   For years, corporate treasurers dreamed of a truly global
debt security that could be traded anywhere in the world,
sold easily in any time zone. Someday, they imagined, a new
Superbond would arise and throw off the usual shackles of
corporate bonds, lowering companies' financing costs by
allowing them to tap a world-wide pool of investors
simultaneously.
   Now, New York-based Citicorp is marketing what it hoped
would be just such a bond. And, as with many dreams when
reality sets in, a few warts show.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "What we are trying to do is create a global security that
can sell in Europe, Asia and the U.S.," Michael T. Nugent,
group treasurer of Citibank's credit-card business, said. "We
learned we had to get out and educate investors more."
   Citicorp has unfurled three separate $1.4 billion
offerings of the new global-style bonds since mid-May,
including one last week. To its credit, the banking giant did
succeed in the arduous task of arranging for local
settlement, or delivery and administration of bonds in each
market. Still, though the new global bonds were rated
triple-A, investors demanded higher yields than those found
on other triple-A corporate debt.
   In the past, U.S. corporations have sold bonds directly
into specific markets abroad, but -- following in the World
Bank's footsteps -- Citicorp believes it is the first company
ever to sell securities in multiple markets simultaneously.
Such global offerings have long been stymied by a thicket of
conflicting national regulations and the absence of a
universal system for settling trades.
   Backing the bonds' interest and principal payments are a
pool of credit-card obligations, a structure with which
Citicorp was already familiar as the leader in the $30
billion market for credit-card securities. Because of this
credit-card wrinkle, the new bonds had some complexities that
an industrial borrower wouldn't face. They also turned out to
be less than an ideal global security, for example, because
asset-backed securities can't be sold directly in Japan,
though Japanese institutions outside the country can buy
them.
   In creating the bonds, Citicorp experimented for 18
months, trying various structures in different markets,
bickering with underwriters, and making a few mistakes. The
company sold bonds registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. It sold unregistered securities in
bearer, or anonymous, form in the Euromarkets. It placed
credit-card securities directly with big institutions. And it
wound up following in the footsteps of a World Bank global
offering made last September.
   Along with other credit-card issuers, Citicorp sold
securities structured like mortgaged-backed securities, where
cash flows vary and the principal is paid over different
periods during the life of the securities. When these proved
too complex, except for sophisticated institutions such as
banks and insurance companies, Citicorp issued securities for
which the principal was paid in a lump sum at maturity. This
way, they looked like regular corporate bonds.
   Meanwhile, the bank experimented with different
maturities, ranging from three to 7 1/2 years, and deals of
different sizes, $225 million to $1 billion.
   All of the offerings were rated triple-A. Initially, they
were backed by letters of credit from similarly rated
international banks, such as Union Bank of Switzerland,
Credit Suisse and Sumitomo Bank Ltd. (Citicorp's own debt is
rated double-A-minus.)
   But the bank learned that investors had a limited capacity
to absorb debt backed by letters of credit, especially
because few big banks were rated triple-A and their numbers
were dwindling. And investors' risk was that if the credit
rating of the bank issuing the guarantee was lowered, the
securities also would be downgraded.
   To solve this problem, Citicorp adopted a so-called
senior-subordinated structure, in which an offering is
divided into two parts. The first, or senior, part -- about
90% of the offering -- is rated triple-A, and is supported by
a higher-yielding, more-risky second, or subordinated, part
that is rated only single-A.
   Still, "We weren't happy with our pricing," Mr. Nugent,
the credit-card official, said. "We were getting single-A
prices." The bank was paying more to borrow than it wanted
to. So last summer, he and his staff met with the bank's main
underwriters in Montreal and New York. They discovered that
investors were confused by the securities' many different
structures, that the secondary, or resale, market for the
bonds was inadequate, and that settlement was slow and
clumsy. Citicorp also learned something about its
underwriters.
   "I presumed that all investment banks educated investors
about structure, cash flow, what they were buying, the risk,
the underlying credit," Mr. Nugent said. Instead, "The
investment banks were essentially selling a cheap triple-A,"
he said. "They were doing a limited amount of work to clear
{sell} whatever was out there, and I was paying for that."
   Indeed, Etienne Bur, a vice president responsible for
managing Banque Nationale de Paris's own portfolios in Paris,
says part of the bonds' appeal has been that he can "buy a
triple-A at single-A prices."
   Mr. Nugent said, "I came away {from the underwriter
meetings} with the realization that we had to standardize the
program, pick a structure and stick with it, and eliminate
confusion in the marketplace." Citicorp officials got the
same advice from the World Bank, which advised talking
directly to investors and not just underwriters. (Last fall,
the big multilateral lending institution launched the first
global bond simultaneously in Europe and the U.S.)
   Mr. Nugent and his staff settled on the name "standard"
for their securities; previously, they used five titles. They
also put together a 150-frame slide show. But crucial to the
efforts was liquidity: the ability to trade the securities
without upsetting their price. "If there is no secondary
market, we are going to fall on our face," Mr. Nugent said.
   Thus, the bank decided to increase its offerings' size. It
also persuaded two big Eurobond clearing, or settlement,
agencies, Cedel S.A. and Euroclear System, to begin handling
the securities. Previously, "If a U.S. investor wanted to
sell, and the best price was in Europe, there was no way of
delivering from the U.S. to Europe, other than putting the
securities on an airplane," Bruce W. Bantz, a vice president
at Citibank's U.S. credit-card business, said, adding, "We
tried to have a security that everybody thought of as a
home-market security."
   This was no easy task, given Citicorp's fondness for
elaborately structured credit-card securities. With $24.22
billion in credit-card receivables as of March 31, Citicorp
is the biggest U.S. issuer of credit cards. By selling
securities with interest and principal payments backed by
credit-card obligations, a process known as securitization,
the bank gains another funding tool, boosts its return on
assets and frees up capital for other businesses.
   Finally, Citicorp arranged to have the London units of big
U.S. investment banks listed as underwriters. In earlier
deals when the New York units were the market makers, their
European affiliates lacked sufficient incentive to serve
investors who wanted to buy the bonds.
   So far, Citicorp's efforts appear to have paid off.
Foreign investors bought 48% and 45%, respectively, of its
first two global bonds launched in May and June. The bank
also estimated that about 45% of the three-year offering last
week was sold abroad, despite the Mideast crisis and
weakening dollar. All three global offerings were registered
with the SEC and used a senior-subordinated structure.
   The senior, $1.25 billion part of last week's issue had an
8 7/8% coupon, and was priced at 99.91 to yield 8.912%. The
$155 million of subordinated securities had a 9 1/8% coupon,
and were priced at 99.855 to yield 9.182%.
   "We are confident in the structure. We are very pleased
with the liquidity," said Mr. Bur of Banque Nationale de
Paris, which is buying the new global bonds this year. As
does most corporate debt, the Citicorp paper yields more than
U.S. Treasury bonds: 0.63 percentage points for last week's
three-year issue, and a hefty 0.88 points for both the
five-year issue in May and seven-year offering in June.
   Despite the extensive efforts to widen investor interest,
Citicorp's bonds still yield more -- roughly 0.3 percentage
point -- than those sold by other companies with triple-A
ratings. The bank believes this gap will narrow, as investors
become more familiar with the securities. But others are
doubtful. "These sort of bonds are quite complicated," Mr.
Bur said.
   A fund manager at a London-based investment bank also is
skeptical. He predicted that new, stiffer capital-adequacy
ratios will prompt U.S. and European banks to flood the
market with securitized debt, and said: "The thing we most
like {about the Citicorp securities} is quite simple: They
look cheap."

   Group's Mideast Crisis Move
   Is Seen as Bid to Reassert
   Influence in Oil Markets

   VIENNA -- The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, in a bid to reassert its influence over oil
markets, freed its members to pump to capacity during the
Middle East crisis.
   The suspension of production quotas had been expected and
won't significantly change anticipated oil supplies for the
months ahead. The few key OPEC members with substantial
excess capacity had previously indicated they were going to
use it with or without formal approval.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But in announcing the move, OPEC signaled its
determination to take a bigger role in the current crisis
after weeks of indecision. In an official statement issued
here, the ministers said they authorized production increases
to "clearly restate to the world that OPEC stands for market
stability and regular supply of oil to consumers."
   OPEC in recent years has attempted to control its
production to avoid the gluts, shortages and severe price
gyrations that cost its members enormous amounts of revenue
and market share in the 1980s.
   Consistent with that strategy, Saudi Arabia and other
leading OPEC members have already begun boosting output
following the price run-up caused by the global embargo
against Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. The action finally taken
yesterday by a majority of the oil ministers sanctions that
output surge. The ministers, who have been meeting since
Sunday, reached a tentative accord earlier this week.
   Crude-oil prices fell almost $2 a barrel yesterday, with
traders citing the OPEC agreement and a growing perception of
easing tensions in the Middle East.
   Many OPEC ministers here suggested the organization passed
a crucial test. There has been some question about OPEC's
ability to function during this crisis, which has entangled
three of its five founding members: Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia.
   "OPEC has survived the most critical challenge in its
history," Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister,
said in an interview.
   Not all OPEC members were pleased with the outcome,
however. Approval came over the objections of the ministers
of Iraq and Libya, who boycotted the meeting and questioned
its legitimacy. A third opponent, Gholamreza Aghazadeh,
Iran's oil minister, did attend but urged that OPEC not
increase output until after major oil-consuming nations have
drawn down their oil inventories to help fill the supply gap.
   Mr. Aghazadeh also tried to have yesterday's ministerial
monitoring committee meeting postponed for a week to permit
joint discussions with the Paris-based International Energy
Agency. The IEA represents 21 major oil-consuming nations.
The 10 other ministers rejected his proposal. Instead, they
called on consuming nations to execute existing oil-sharing
arrangements designed for shortages and to utilize the
"present huge accumulation" of oil inventories.
   Despite the OPEC request, a U.S. Energy Department
spokesman in Washington argued that there is no need yet to
draw on strategic reserves. That also will be the U.S.
position at tomorrow's IEA governors meeting in Paris.
Nevertheless, there are signs that U.S. resistance to dipping
into its reserves is softening. With OPEC sanctioning more
production from members that are able to increase output, the
U.S. could consider a small release of oil from its reserve
to help calm markets.
   A majority of OPEC members have been producing at peak
capacity for some time, so despite yesterday's go-ahead, only
a handful can do more. These are expected to make up at least
three million of the four million barrels a day formerly
exported by Iraq and Kuwait. Saudi Arabia is understood to
hold two-thirds, or about two million barrels, of that spare
capacity.
   Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, left immediately
after yesterday's brief meeting and didn't outline the
kingdom's production plans. OPEC sources said, however, that
it is already producing more than seven million barrels a
day. Its quota had been 5.4 million barrels a day.
   Venezuela also is already producing more. Celestino Armas,
oil minister, confirmed output recently was increased 300,000
barrels a day. A further 200,000 barrels a day will be added
by the end of the year, he said.
   The United Arab Emirates is pushing up output by 500,000
barrels a day. And although some of the production claims
seem inflated, lesser amounts are likely to come from some
other exporters. Nigeria can produce 250,000 to 280,000
barrels a day more, said its oil minister, Jibril Aminu.
   Several of the oil ministers suggested that a tabulation
of all the increases still leaves OPEC slightly short of its
former second-half production ceiling -- 22.5 million barrels
a day -- as long as Iraqi and Kuwaiti output is choked down.
   Still, Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Kuwait's finance minister and
former oil minister who represented that country here, said
supplies should be ample, with oil prices dropping as a
result. "There will be plenty of oil on the market, and there
is definitely no reason for panic," he said.

   After Sallie Mae's Plunge, Some Analysts Say
   Fears Over HEAF Losses May Be Overblown

   NEW YORK -- When will Wall Street stop beating Sallie Mae
stock?
   Until a few weeks ago, the Student Loan Marketing
Association, or Sallie Mae, was the darling of portfolio
managers, a financial growth stock with a triple-A credit
rating. Propelled by earnings increases of more than 20% a
year and the market's enthusiasm for growth stocks, Sallie
Mae shares rose from around 30 each in early 1988 to a peak
of 56 1/2 on July 17.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But less than a week later, this newspaper reported
deepening financial difficulties at the Higher Education
Assistance Foundation, a privately run firm that had become
the largest student-loan guarantee agency in the nation.
   Fearing that Sallie Mae might face losses from HEAF's
woes, portfolio managers dumped the stock. Sallie Mae shares
were trading in the mid-40s within days, and sank as low as
34 3/4 in last week's stock-market rout. Based on yesterday's
closing price of 41 5/8, investors have trimmed nearly $1.5
billion from Sallie Mae's market value in less than six
weeks.
   Several Wall Street analysts who follow Sallie Mae believe
the company won't suffer any losses from HEAF's troubles and
that the market has punished Sallie Mae far more than it
deserves. These analysts are pounding the table to try to
lure portfolio managers back into the stock.
   "Sallie Mae is one of the strongest financial institutions
in the United States," says John E. Keefe, an analyst with
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, who believes Sallie Mae's stock price
will head back toward 50 by the end of the year. At the heart
of Mr. Keefe's recommendation is his belief that whatever
happens to HEAF, the Department of Education won't allow
Sallie Mae or other holders of student loans to suffer a
loss.
   Eric I. Hemel, a First Boston analyst, takes a similar
view and expresses it with a lack of equivocation unusual on
Wall Street. "We see zero, and we mean zero, HEAF-related
losses at Sallie Mae," Mr. Hemel declared in a report this
month on Sallie Mae. Mr. Hemel and others, including Sallie
Mae executives, argue that the government can't allow lenders
to take losses on student loans as a result of HEAF's
problems, because lenders will then stop making new loans and
the program will grind to a halt.
   Sallie Mae buys government-guaranteed student loans from
banks and thrifts and earns a spread between the interest
paid on loans and its cost of borrowing. HEAF is an
intermediary between holders of student loans, such as Sallie
Mae, and the Department of Education.
   If a borrower defaults, the loan holder seeks payment from
a guarantee agency such as HEAF, which submits a claim for
reimbursement to the government. If too many of an agency's
guaranteed loans default in one fiscal year, the government
cuts its reimbursement to 90% and then to 80%. HEAF, which
guaranteed many trade-school loans, is now in the 80%
category.
   Lawrence A. Hough, Sallie Mae's recently appointed
president and chief executive officer, said in an interview
that Sallie Mae owns about $2.5 billion of HEAF-guaranteed
student loans, and has loans and loan commitments totaling $1
billion to HEAF and its affiliates. All the loans are backed
by more than enough collateral in the form of cash, student
loans or receivables from the government, Mr. Hough said. He
believes the government will make sure Sallie Mae and other
loan holders get 100% reimbursement on their HEAF-guaranteed
loans. But even if that doesn't happen, Mr. Hough says Sallie
Mae's maximum pretax loss would total between $30 million and
$50 million, spread over three or four years.
   A concern of analyst Lacy M. Shockley at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham, who isn't recommending Sallie Mae, is that the
company may have to get into the loan-guarantee business
itself to help resolve HEAF's problems. Though Sallie Mae
once proposed taking on some guarantee business, Mr. Hough
said that proposal was withdrawn and that Sallie Mae won't
become a guarantor unless it can be done with "the same
virtually zero-risk characteristic that describes our normal
business."
   Sallie Mae's shares are being hurt, in part, because the
resolution of HEAF's troubles and the future size of the
studentloan program are political issues unfamiliar to Wall
Street. "When political questions enter the valuation
equation, many investors just don't want to take the time and
they head elsewhere," Mr. Keefe says. "For years, Sallie Mae
has been a 90-second story. Now it takes three minutes. In a
difficult market, the portfolio manager just doesn't have
that much patience."

   WASHINGTON -- Ponce Federal Bank, one of the largest
thrifts in Puerto Rico, was hit with strong enforcement
measures by the Office of Thrift Supervision -- including an
order to change the locks on its doors.
   The measures, designed to "increase the bank's safety and
soundness," according to the OTS, include a temporary
cease-and-desist order issued against Ramiro L. Colon, former
chairman, president and chief executive officer and now a
stockholder, and his brother, Wendell W. Colon, former thrift
counsel and also a stockholder.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to the OTS, the Colons have been ordered to stop
causing the bank to violate federal regulations against loans
to affiliated parties and insider transactions, and to post a
$50,000 bond to make funds available for restitution to the
thrift.
   The OTS order also calls for members of the thrift's board
and Ramiro Colon to pay $615,000 in restitution to Ponce
Federal.
   Ponce Federal itself has been directed, among other
measures, to comply with OTS regulations dealing with loans
to affiliated parties and insider transactions; to stop any
direct employment-related payments to Ramiro Colon; and to
deny the Colons access to any of the institution's records or
files. Federal regulators also ordered the thrift to change
its locks and deny keys to the Colons.
   Regulators noted that the measures don't affect the
thrift's daily operations or depositors' accounts, which
continue to be insured up to $100,000.
   Thrift officials and Messrs. Colon weren't available for
comment.

   WASHINGTON -- The savings-and-loan bailout agency has
chosen an Alexandria, Va., real estate firm to manage $2.4
billion of real estate and loans seized from a Houston
thrift, government and private-sector sources said.
   If a contract to oversee and sell the properties is
finalized with the management firm, J.E. Robert Co., it would
be the first major asset-management contract awarded by the
Resolution Trust Corp. It also is likely to be one of the
largest single blocks of assets the agency puts under a
management contract.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The package is made up of thousands of loans and
properties previously held by University Savings Association
of Houston. The government seized the thrift, which was one
of the bigger failed savings and loans, and it was sold last
October to banking firm NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C., for $129
million. NCNB, however, assumed the thrift's deposits and
left most of the assets in the hands of the government. NCNB
has been managing the properties under an interim contract.
   Among the assets are delinquent commercial real estate
loans, shopping centers, hotels and land. Under the contract,
J.E. Robert would prepare the properties to be sold. In the
case of loans, that includes the arduous legal process of
foreclosing on the loans and sorting out other claims so that
the government can sell the properties.
   It wasn't known how much J.E. Robert bid to manage the
properties, but generally the asset manager receives an
annual fee of about 0.5% of the total value of the properties
and then anywhere from 1.5% to 4% of the sales price. Thus,
the value of the contract could be $100 million or more if it
lasts four or five years.
   RTC officials have said they expect to have $20 billion to
$30 billion of real estate and real estate loan assets under
management contract by year's end. As of June 30, the RTC had
total assets of $165.3 billion, but about $120 billion of
that was in securities and performing mortgages that the
agency finds easier to sell than the real estate and
delinquent loans that generally will make up the packages put
under contract.
   Joseph Robert, president of J.E. Robert, declined to
comment.
   A spokesman for the RTC also wouldn't comment on whether
J.E. Robert had been selected, but he said, "Our
asset-management program has been established now, and we
expect to be regularly awarding contracts in the weeks
ahead."
   The agency had a false start with the asset-management
program this year after many firms protested that the RTC's
process of randomly narrowing the field of bidders was
"irrational." The RTC changed the system to try to take the
experience of the bidders more into account.
   Separately, the RTC said it agreed to sell $379.2 million
of residential mortgage loans to Lehman Capital Corp. The
portfolio of 5,246 fixed-rate first mortgages, which were
assets of Horizon Financial, Southampton, Pa., will be sold
for 98.25% of the unpaid principal balance on the day of
settlement, expected within three weeks.

   Canada's other commercial banks didn't immediately follow
Bank of Montreal's move.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lloyd Atkinson, Bank of Montreal chief economist, said a
lower prime rate was appropriate because of "the stability of
the Canadian dollar combined with evidence of weak economic

   Bank of Montreal last adjusted its prime rate Aug. 14 when
it lowered the rate one-half percentage point to 14.25%.

   AMAX Inc. and its 87%-owned Amax Gold Inc. said they filed
a registration statement for a secondary offering of at least

the sale would raise about $160 million for the parent
company. Thomas McKeever, Amax executive vice president, said
the New York-based energy and mining company would use the
proceeds for general corporate purposes. Under the offering,
Amax would sell 9.5 million units consisting of one share and
a warrant to buy another share of Amax Gold. If all the
shares are sold and the warrants exercised, Amax's stake in
Amax Gold would be reduced to 55%. If the warrants aren't
exercised, the parent would continue to hold about 71% of
Denver-based Amax Gold. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets is the

   WASHINGTON -- The populations of many big industrial
states stagnated in the 1980s, while Americans swarmed to the
Sun Belt and the West Coast, according to preliminary U.S.
Census Bureau figures.
   The population of New York state barely grew over the past
decade, rising a mere 0.4%, to 17,626,586 from 17,558,000.
Over the past year, it actually declined. The populations of
Illinois and Pennsylvania also slipped slightly between 1980
and 1990.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the population of California surged nearly 24% in the
1980s, to 29,279,015 in 1990 from 23,668,000 in 1980. Texas
grew 18%, to 16,824,665 from 14,229,000 in 1980, although its
population slipped over the past year, according to the
figures.
   The figures on New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Illinois
were released yesterday, completing the Census Bureau's
preliminary population listings for all 50 states.
   California easily retained its spot as the most populous
state, while New York managed to hang onto the No. 2
position.
   A Census Bureau official cautioned that the counts are
incomplete and likely will be changed in the final report,
which is expected next spring.

   Perkin-Elmer Corp. reported a 3% increase in net income
for the fourth quarter ending July 31 as sales rose 7.4%,
reflecting successful restructuring efforts completed during
fiscal 1990.
   Perkin-Elmer, which manufactures analytical instruments
used in material-science laboratories, reported quarterly net
income rose to $13.6 million, or 38 cents a share, from $13.2
million, or 30 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Per-share earnings reflect the company's buy-back of 10.1
million of its common shares.
</LP>

   In addition to the share buy-back, the restructuring
included the sale of seven business units by the Norwalk,
Conn., company.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Perkin-Elmer shares closed at $22.875, up $1.375.

   LIESHOUT, the Netherlands -- The Bavaria brewery said
Saudi Arabia has asked it to double its exports of
non-alcoholic beer to the Middle East nation to help slake
the thirst of U.S. soldiers there.
   But the company already finds it hard to satisfy both
normal demand from Islamic clients and from a home market
where alcohol-free brews enjoy a growing reputation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The demand is much too large for us at the moment," said
Rien Coolen, a spokesman for the Bavaria brewery, which has
been exporting alcohol-free beer to Saudi Arabia for 15
years.
   A strict Islamic nation, Saudi Arabia prohibits the sale
of alcohol. To help meet the Saudi request, the brewery is
increasing output and will ask employees to work overtime,
Mr. Coolen added.
   Mr. Coolen declined to disclose the size of the Saudi
request or give details of his brewery's exports, citing
competitive reasons.

   American Express Co.'s travel unit, getting acquisitive
after nearly five years on the sidelines, has agreed to buy
AIT Travel Management Cos. of Phoenix, Ariz.
   American Express officials declined to disclose the price
of the acquisition, which the company expects to be completed
soon, pending regulatory approval. The purchase by American
Express Travel Related Services is the first acquisition of a
business travel firm since mid-1985.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Indeed, the decision to buy AIT Travel, which specializes
in business travel in the Southwest region, reflects American
Express's bullish outlook on the business-travel market.
Despite a slowdown in the U.S. economy, the company estimates
that the overall market for business travel and entertainment
in the U.S. will reach $115 billion in 1990, up from $95
billion two years ago. The acquisition also fits with
American Express's strategy to expand in the Southwest.
   AIT Travel Management operates 26 full-service ticket
locations in eight Southwestern states, with sales volume for
1990 expected to top $90 million.

   Interphase Corp. said it will take a charge of $2.8
million, or 85 cents a share, against third-quarter earnings
after writing off its investment in Omni Solutions Inc.
   The Dallas maker of microcomputer products said profit
posted in its core business during the period was not enough
to offset the charge, and the company expects to post a loss
for the quarter ended July 31.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A year after acquiring its majority interest in Omni, a
computer components maker, Interphase said it decided to
write off the investment because of high start-up costs and
"significant delays" in Omni's product development. Effective
Sept. 1, Omni will cease to exist as an independent company,
and Interphase will provide customer support for Omni's
products in the marketplace, the company said.
   "Since we will no longer be incurring losses associated
with Omni operations, we expect to report a profit for the
fourth quarter," said Michael E. Cope, Interphase president.
   For the six months ended April 30, Interphase posted a
loss of $1.2 million, or 37 cents a share, on revenue of
$12.4 million.

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Refco Inc., a Chicago futures firm, agreed
to pay a $220,000 fine to settle Commodity Futures Trading
Commission charges that it failed to maintain certain
records, and that it violated regulatory orders relating to
its record keeping.
   The charges stemmed from alleged actions by Ray Friedman
of Palm Beach, Fla., a founder of Refco and a longtime
trader. The CFTC alleged that Mr. Friedman, trading for an
unnamed customer, violated speculative position limits for
pork belly futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for
about a year, beginning in June 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The commission charged Mr. Friedman with aiding and
abetting Refco in not keeping written records of the orders.
The CFTC said that Mr. Friedman hasn't settled the charges.
   Refco was charged with failing to maintain the records,
failing to retain customer risk-disclosure statements,
failing to supervise, and violating two cease-and-desist
orders entered by the CFTC in 1983 and 1988 relating to
record keeping and supervision charges.
   The company, which didn't admit or deny any wrongdoing,
consented to a CFTC finding that it violated the regulations
cited by the commission. In addition to the fine, Refco
agreed to refrain from further violations and to review its
supervising procedures.
   In a prepared statement, Refco said: "The alleged
record-keeping violations did not affect the profitability of
customer accounts. It is Refco's intent to comply with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations. Refco has settled
this matter in order to maintain its positive working
relationship with the CFTC and to avoid the costs and
distraction of protracted litigation."
   In an unrelated action, the CFTC charged Craig LaCrosse of
Oak Brook, Ill., with aiding and abetting another floor
broker in entering false order records and engaging in
improper and false sales. The CFTC also alleged that Mr.
LaCrosse engaged in noncompetitive trading.
   Mr. LaCrosse, a registered floor broker and member of the
Chicago Board of Trade, was one of 45 traders indicted last
year by a grand jury for alleged trading abuses.
   Mr. LaCrosse last year pleaded guilty to aiding and
abetting the creation of a false record in connection with a
customer order and to making a prearranged accommodation
trade.

   ATLANTA -- Ray Howell, a key witness in a federal
investigation of political contributions by a Southern Co.
unit, was sentenced to two years' probation on contempt and
tax charges.
   Mr. Howell, who did graphics work for Southern's
Pensacola, Fla., Gulf Power Co. unit, disappeared prior to
his scheduled appearance before a federal grand jury in
Atlanta and hid for a year before surrendering last December.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As part of his guilty plea in April, Mr. Howell agreed to
cooperate in a continuing investigation into illegal
political contributions. The U.S. attorney's office recently
filed papers under seal that gave details of Mr. Howell's
cooperation.
   Individuals familiar with the investigation say Mr. Howell
can shed light on the roles of individuals who were involved
in the alleged political contributions scheme.
   Last October, Gulf Power pleaded guilty to two felony
charges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions
and tax evasion and paid a $500,000 fine, ending the case
against it. However, an investigation of the individuals
involved continues.
   Papers filed in federal court in Atlanta in the Gulf Power
case alleged that Gulf Power used Mr. Howell's Design
Associates Inc. to funnel money to the 1988 campaign of
Florida State Sen. W.D. Childers. Federal law bars utility
holding companies from making political contributions.

   National Intergroup Inc. improved the terms of a tender
offer for the cumulative convertible preference units
outstanding representing limited partnership interests of
Permian Partners L.P.
   Pittsburgh-based National Intergroup still will pay $3.85
a preference unit. But it agreed to extend the term of
accompanying contingent value rights to June 30, 1993, from
June 30, 1992, and to increase the possible payout under
those rights.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The rights would allow the holders to share in the
proceeds in excess of the cash they had already received in
the event that the Permian partnership is sold within a
specified time period. Under the new terms, holders would
receive 100% of the amount of the excess proceeds during the
entire life of the rights, instead of a graduated scale
dropping to 50% after June 1, 1992.
   National Intergroup said earlier this week that only
5,535,680 preference units had been tendered as of Aug. 27,
well below the 7,875,001 units, a majority of the publicly
held units, that National Intergroup had specified as the
minimum required to make the offer effective.
   National Intergroup is primarily a drug wholesaler but it
also has interests in metals, general merchandising and oil
production. Directors recently agreed to consider sale of the
firm's drug unit, FoxMeyer Corp., or of the entire company.

   Technology:
   Device Can Concentrate
   Light to Greater Intensity

<LP>
   CHICAGO -- University of Chicago researchers said they
developed a solar device that can concentrate sunlight to an
intensity 15% greater than on the surface of the sun itself.
   Roland Winston, head of the Department of Physics and a
researcher, said scientists have been trying to heighten the
intensity of collected sunlight because a highly concentrated
beam of light could someday power laser communication in
space or incinerate hazardous wastes, among other uses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The group's feat, which amounted to concentrating sunlight
to 84,000 times its normal intensity on Earth, surpasses the
previous record achieved by the researchers in 1988 by 40%,
he said.
   He said the group achieved the feat by first using a
conventional telescope mirror to focus the light to a
square-centimeter area. A precisely machined cone of sapphire
then concentrated that focused light into a square-millimeter
area. Key to the advance in intensity was a sapphire that was
"mathematically designed" to give the maximum possible
refractive index, or ability to bend light.
   In the latest experiments, the researchers measured the
energy output of the solar collector by heating fluid. The
solar collector generated 72 watts a square millimeter,
compared with 63 watts generated at the surface of the sun.
Normal sunlight that reaches Earth amounts to less than
one-thousandth of a watt a square millimeter.

Analysts estimate the one-time gain in the range of $60
million to $70 million. The sale is part of First Fidelity's

   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- Dennison Manufacturing Co., seeking
to placate shareholders and clear the way for its proposed
merger with Avery International Corp., has agreed to settle a
holder suit filed against it in connection with the merger.
   Under the proposed settlement, Avery Dennison Corp., the
surviving entity after the merger, would pay a quarterly
dividend of 20 cents a share for four consecutive quarters
after the merger closes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Avery, based in Pasadena, Calif., currently pays a
quarterly dividend of 16 cents a share and has said that it
will recommend a quarterly rate of 18 cents a share if the
merger is completed.
   The dividend rate to be paid after the four quarters
covered by the proposed agreement would be at the discretion
of the company's board, according to Gerald Hendrick,
Dennison's general counsel.
   The stock-swap merger of the two companies would create
one of the nation's largest office-products concerns, with
about $2.5 billion in annual sales. Dennison holders would
receive 1.12 Avery shares for each Dennison share.
   Dennison said the settlement is contingent upon completion
of the merger, an agreement on a stipulation in the
settlement and court approval. The suit is pending in
Massachusetts Superior Court.

   Barry's Jewelers Inc., Monrovia, Calif., said its
fiscal-fourth-quarter loss widened to $12.1 million, or $2.42
a share, because of increased provisions for bad debts.
   In the year-earlier quarter, Barry's had a loss of
$754,000, or 15 cents a share. Sales for the latest period,
ended May 31, dipped to $31.6 million from $31.9 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Trading of Barry's stock in the national over-the-counter
market was halted briefly yesterday pending the earnings
announcement. The stock closed at $4.25, down $1.50.
   Barry's, which operates 224 stores nationwide, said it
hadn't expected the increase in bad-debt provisions to be as
large as it was. The rise reflects "continuing deterioration
in the general retail environment," Barry's said, and its own
"increasingly adverse bad-debt experience," mainly in the
Southwest. Barry's also cited the effect of adjusting the
value of its accounts receivable for financing purposes.
   For fiscal 1990, Barry's posted a $15.5 million loss, or
$3.10 a share, compared with net income of $6 million, or
$1.21 a share. Sales rose 5.6%, to $165.7 million from $157
million.

   CHICAGO -- GATX Corp. said its aircraft-leasing joint
venture with France's Credit Lyonnais agreed to obtain $400
million in additional capital from new Japanese and U.S.
investors.
   The move will trim the two original partners' stake to 30%
each, GATX said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new investors -- Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., Nichimen Corp.,
and Sanwa Bank Ltd. of Japan; and the Household Commercial
Financial Services unit of Household International Inc. --
each received a 10% interest in the venture, and committed to
invest $100 million apiece.
   GATX and Credit Lyonnais began the aircraft-leasing
venture, known as GATX/CL Air, in 1988, with total funding of
$1 billion. The funds were used to acquire aircraft that are
leased to certain South American airlines, and for 20 Airbus
A320-200 jets to be delivered to other airlines over the next
several years.
   GATX said it anticipates the new financing will be used to
acquire additional aircraft.
   GATX has interests in railcar and aircraft leasing,
financial services, and bulk liquid terminal storage.

   BASF AG said its 1990 first-half group pretax profit
tumbled 21% to 1.74 billion marks ($1.11 billion) from 2.19
billion marks in the year-earlier period.
   The profit decline for West Germany's largest chemical
concern came on a 4.5% drop in group sales, which fell to
23.37 billion marks from 24.46 billion marks a year before.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the second quarter, group pretax profit plummeted 31%
to 891 million marks from 1.29 billion marks. Group sales
fell 8.1% to 11.48 billion marks from 12.49 billion marks.
   BASF said it sees difficulties for the rest of the year.
The company said that although there are "good" prospects for
boosting the volume of products sold, it expects to attain
only the "solid earnings" level of 1987, rather than the
level of 1988 or the record performance of 1989.

   The board of Northeast Bancorp Inc., holding company of
Union Trust Co., adopted a poison-pill measure designed to
make a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive.
   The move comes two weeks after the Federal Reserve Board
turned down a proposed acquisition of Northeast by Bank of
New York Co. The Fed said the acquisition would have hurt the
New York bank's ability to maintain a strong capital
position.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On Sept. 11, Northeast will distribute rights to purchase
common stock to holders of record Sept. 10. Under certain
circumstances, the rights would entitle the holders to
acquire shares of Northeast Bancorp or its acquirer at half
price.
   Northeast Bancorp, which had about 7.3 million shares
outstanding at June 30, said the plan isn't a response to any
effort to take control of the Stamford, Conn., banking
company.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Northeast

   NEW YORK -- Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. named Fox
Inc. president Jonathan Dolgen to the new post of president
of the Columbia Pictures film studio.
   The appointment marks a return to Columbia for Mr. Dolgen,
who first joined the old Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. in
1976 and rose to president of domestic operations in 1983,
before quitting in 1985 to join Fox, a unit of News Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Dolgen, 45 years old, will be president of the
Columbia Pictures film division and will report to Frank
Price, chairman of the studio. He will oversee daily
operations for Columbia, which operates separately from the
parent company's other production units, including Tri-Star
Pictures and a television production arm.
   At Fox, a replacement for Mr. Dolgen hasn't been named.
Mr. Dolgen had been president of Fox Inc., which owns the Fox
television network, since 1988 and a year ago took on the
additional title of president of Fox's television-production
unit, Twentieth Television, which makes such series as "L.A.
Law"
   Although Mr. Dolgen will report to Frank Price, Columbia's
studio chairman, he also will have other corporate
responsibilities that will have him reporting directly to
Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the co-chairmen of Columbia
Pictures Entertainment, which was recently acquired by Sony
Corp.
   "I'm going to work with Frank and my other friends at
Columbia Pictures, and I'm going to work with Jon and Peter
to deal with issues they think are suited to my skills," Mr.
Dolgen said in an interview.

   NEW YORK -- The dollar and yen, the two currencies hit the
hardest by expensive oil, rose yesterday on the back of
falling petroleum prices.
   The U.S. and Japanese currencies fared the best against
continental European currencies. The pound and other
currencies supported by high interest rates held their own.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The biggest loser on the day was the Swiss franc, which
was sold off when dealers learned that Switzerland's
benchmark Lombard rate had been lowered to 9.375% from 9.5%
Tuesday. Last week, the rate was above 10%.
   In addition, comments yesterday by National Bank President
Markus Lusser convinced currency investors that the central
bank will hold firm only on interest rates of long-term
securities, and not the shortterm paper favored by currency
speculators.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.5595 marks and 1.2900 Swiss francs, up from 1.5563 marks
and 1.2867 francs late Tuesday in New York. The U.S. currency
was also changing hands at 143.60 yen, down from 143.73 yen.
   The yen posted gains against the mark and Swiss franc. The
mark declined to 92.081 yen from 92.354 yen, and the franc
dropped to 111.318 yen from 111.704 yen.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 143.65 yen, down from 144.35 yen at the close there
Wednesday. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5599 marks, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.5556
marks.
   The market's movements yesterday also reflected the first
attempts by dealers to level positions ahead of month-end
accounting and a holiday weekend in North America.
   Amid these adjustments, the dollar is enjoying a grace
period, said Mark Morris, a dealer in New York for National
Westminster Bank. Even as it retains lingering support as a
"haven" from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the greenback is
gaining from the effect that new-found optimism for peace is
having on oil prices.
   Once dealers are completely free to ignore Baghdad, he
said, the dollar will fall once again. Even cheap oil won't
save the wobbly U.S. economy, many observers think.
   Sterling was trading late in New York at $1.9460, up from
$1.9428 Tuesday. The Canadian and Australian dollars ended at
87.63 cents and 83.12 cents, respectively, up from 87.54
cents and 82.97 cents.
   In fact, these so-called Anglo high-yielders, which had
risen in recent weeks because of their status as
petrocurrencies, stood to lose yesterday as the benchmark
crude oil futures contract fell $1.96 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange to $25.92 a barrel. But interest-rate
shopping held these currencies firm.
   Meanwhile, speculation about a possible Japanese
discount-rate increase heated up as two Japanese daily
newspapers reported that the Finance Ministry and Bank of
Japan had started discussing such a move Tuesday. Bank of
Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno denied any such discussions
Wednesday. However, early Thursday in Tokyo, the Bank of
Japan raised the discount rate by 0.75 percentage point to
6%.
   Analysts had been looking for the Bank of Japan to raise
its discount rate by early October, after the central bank's
quarterly survey of business sentiment and the second-quarter
gross national product report come out in the middle of
September.
   Jumpei Ishii, deputy foreign-exchange department manager
at Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, said the market has factored a
rise of 75 basis points in the discount rate into the market.
Mr. Ishii himself predicted a rise to 6.25% from the current
5.25%.
   The dollar rose against the yen in heavy Asian trading
Wednesday, finishing mixed against other currencies. The U.S.
currency was last quoted in Tokyo Wednesday at 144.35 yen,
compared with 143.20 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
   Yen selling to close out long positions shook the market
in the Japanese afternoon and pushed volume to high levels.
The pound joined the dollar in rising strongly against the
yen.
   The dollar ended European trading slightly higher, in what
traders termed a technical consolidation amid quiet dealings.
Dollar activity was slack, with most action focused on cross
movements in the yen.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $385.30 an ounce, up 30 cents. Estimated
volume was a heavy six million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $386.25 an
ounce.

   Citing successful introduction of new models and solid

car maker, said its consolidated pretax profit in the fiscal
year ended June 30 surged 34% to 837.81 billion yen ($5.83
billion) from 625.66 billion yen a year earlier.
   Toyota Motor's vehicle sales during the reporting period
grew strongly world-wide, supported in particular by strong
demand in the domestic market. Japan is the company's largest
market, where sales reached record levels for the third
consecutive year, the company said.

   Net income rose 27% to 441.3 billion yen, or 144.15 yen a

   Sales totaled 9.192 trillion yen, a 15% gain from 8.021
trillion yen last year.
   Toyota said its overseas operations are likely to face
much more severe conditions, as demand in the U.S. market
continues to slacken and competition increases in Europe.
   The company disclosed a plan to change Toyota's corporate
charter as part of an effort to branch out into nonautomotive
businesses. Toyota officials will ask a shareholders meeting,
scheduled for Sept. 26, to approve diversification plans. The
company wants to raise nonautomotive sales, currently
accounting for 2% of overall unconsolidated sales, to 6% in
fiscal 1994.

   DOMINGUEZ, Calif. -- Pic `N' Save Corp. said it will
report a loss for its fiscal second quarter and six months
due mainly to charges and costs related to its recent proxy
contest and restructuring.
   Pic `N' Save recently forestalled a threatened proxy fight
with Girard Partners L.P. and investor David Batchelder by
agreeing to put Mr. Batchelder and two associates on the
board, widening a planned stock buy-back and lifting certain
anti-takeover measures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pic 'N' Save, which operates a chain of retail stores
specializing in close-out merchandise, didn't specify the
amount of the costs, charges or losses, nor did it comment on
operating results.
   The company said the charges include a $1.6 million
after-tax severance package for Lewis B. Merrifield III,
president and chief executive officer, who has resigned
effective Jan. 1, and $1.7 million that Pic 'N' Save agreed
to pay Girard Partners as reimbursement for proxy-fight
expenses.
   In the quarter ended July 2, 1989, Pic 'N' Save had net
income of $6.4 million, or 18 cents a share, on sales of
$101.8 million. In last year's first half, the company had
net income of $11.8 million, or 33 cents a share, on sales of
$195.9 million.
   Pic 'N' Save said it believes that after the 1990 second
quarter it will have recognized all expenses and
extraordinary items from the proxy fight and restructuring
except for interest and other expenses related to additional
stock repurchases.
   "We are confident that with the distraction and disruption
of the proxy contest behind us and the programs we have
recently put in place, we should be profitable for the
remainder of the year," Mr. Merrifield told the annual
meeting yesterday. The company also expects to be profitable
for the full year, a spokesman said.

   Japan Raises Discount Rate by 0.75 Point

<LP>
   TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan boosted its benchmark interest
rate Thursday, taking what some economists warned could be an
internationally risky step to avert inflation at home.
   The central bank said it would raise its discount rate
0.75 percentage point to 6.0%, effective immediately. The
discount rate is the amount the central bank charges on loans
to financial institutions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The increase was the fifth since authorities started
tightening official credit in May 1989. The last time the
discount rate was at this level was Dec. 11, 1981, when the
Bank of Japan lowered it to 5.5% from 6.25%.
   More critically to the rest of the world, though, the rate
change was the first since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug.
2 sent oil prices soaring and threw most countries' economic
plans into limbo.
   And Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno suggested it
might not be the last rate increase if the crisis continues.
   Mr. Mieno said the central bank hoped its action would
help sustain, not derail, economic growth. "Under these
circumstances at home and abroad we concluded that we had to
act at this time to ensure continued stable growth," he said.
   By raising the discount rate, the Bank of Japan said it
hoped to ward off inflation at home. The bank said in a
statement that the decision to raise the rate reflected
domestic economic concerns, including a tight labor market,
rapidly expanding money supply and rising money market
interest rates. Unstated was the worry uppermost in many
officials' minds here that high oil prices eventually could
translate into inflation in Japan, a country that imports 99%
of its oil. People in Japan still refer to the 1973 and 1979
oil crises as "shocks."
   But coming in the midst of the crisis in the Middle East
and a slowing U.S. economy, some analysts warned that the
Bank of Japan's decision could prove too focused on domestic
concerns -- and harmful to the international economy.
   "If it causes any upward pressure in rates
internationally, it could be very bad," said Keikichi Honda,
director of economic research at Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
   Japanese policy makers were presented with an agonizing
conundrum. At issue was whether, with rates in the Japanese
credit market already rising, authorities should push
interest rates higher. Higher interest rates probably will
succeed in forestalling inflation with the domestic economy
expanding rapidly -- many economists expect it to grow nearly
5% this year. Japan's annualized inflation rate during June,
as measured by the consumer price index, was 2.2%.
   But Japan's effort to hold down its relatively tame
inflation could be the nail in the U.S. economy's coffin when
many are increasingly concerned about the possibility of a
U.S. recession. Policy makers at the U.S. Federal Reserve
have been leaning toward a modest easing of credit. Fed
officials suggest, however, that they won't move to cut
short-term interest rates until financial markets settle
down.
   Higher Japanese interest rates would compound Washington's
problem by making it harder for the U.S. authorities to lower
rates. Japanese investors already have grown weary of funding
the U.S. debt when they can obtain equivalent returns on
Japanese government bonds.
   In an interview before the rate change, Tomomitsu Oba,
president of the Japan Center for International Finance and a
former vice minister of finance, warned that if Japan raises
rates too quickly, "the world economy will be facing a very,
very serious problem."
   So delicate is the economic balance that analysts Thursday
morning were speculating that Mr. Mieno, the central bank
governor, must have discussed the rate change in advance with
U.S. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. Mr. Mieno himself said
Wednesday that he was taking "international" considerations
into account in setting Japan's monetary policy. Bank of
Japan officials wouldn't elaborate on their statement
announcing the rate change.
   The world's financial markets are acutely sensitive to the
dangers, though. Rumors this week that the Bank of Japan was
considering a discount-rate increase pushed the yen to its
highest levels of the year. Wednesday, markets were upset
again by leaks in the Japanese media that the central bank
had begun discussions with the Ministry of Finance on raising
the rate by 0.75 percentage point to one point. The reports
cited worries about the inflationary effects of higher world
oil prices resulting from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and
of tight labor conditions in Japan.
   Although the Bank of Japan moved aggressively to squelch
any such speculation, its announcement Thursday that the rate
indeed would rise gave mild reassurance to the markets. But
the stock market gave back most of its early gains, finishing
up 34.68 points at 24929.47. It had been up more than 300
points earlier.
   "They kind of caught people off guard after denying it"
Wednesday, said Mike Morizumi, a strategist in Tokyo for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "But people are basically
accepting it."
   Only a day earlier, reports of a possible increase in the
discount rate had crushed a three-session recovery on the
beleaguered Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei index plunged
815.97 points, or 3.17%, to 24894.79.
   Now, analysts say, the great fear is that Thursday's rate
change won't be the last. In a news conference Thursday
morning, Mr. Mieno hinted that there could be more, saying
that the situation in the Persian Gulf would require flexible
monetary policy.
   "The prospect of war is so close," said Richard Koo, an
economist at Nomura Securities Co.'s research affiliate. "It
would be much worse if they tried to raise rates now, a war
starts, oil prices rise, and they have to do it again."

   Banco Espanol de Credito confirmed it is postponing a
share offering in its industrial holding group, Industrial &amp;
Financiera de Banesto S.A.
   A spokesman said the delay was decided in the light of
adverse stock market conditions. Since the start of August,
international market turmoil has taken about 100 billion
pesetas ($1.04 billion) off the holding company's market
value.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Banesto wanted to raise between 85 billion and 95 billion
pesetas from the sale of 25.4% to 26.3% of the holding
company, of which it owns 76.4%. Under current conditions, a
bank official said, such a target wouldn't be realistic.
Instead, he said, the bank intends to go ahead with technical
planning so that the offering can proceed as soon as market
conditions improve.
   The Banesto holding company owns stakes in such
corporations as oil refiner Petroleos del Mediterraneo S.A.,
metals producer Asturiana de Zinc S.A. and steelmaker
Acerinox S.A., whose shares have fallen steeply in recent

banks will continue to operate under their current names. The
new company will have dual headquarters in Atlanta and
Norfolk, Va.

   General Development Corp., the beleaguered real-estate
company, introduced a plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Miami
to reassure its customers and to stabilize its own
operations.
   The Miami-based company, which filed for bankruptcy-law
protection in April, said the plan includes, among other
measures, financial incentives for buyers of the company's
home sites to continue making payments, and a lot-transfer
program, under which customers with contracts for home sites
that are currently undeveloped would be transferred to a
comparable developed one.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   General Development said company surveys have shown that
the top priority among its home-site buyers is assurance that
they will receive a deed to a developed home site. About 21%
of the company's customers made their July home-site payment.
But if customers received assurances of obtaining a deed and
financial incentives, the survey indicated, then about 63% of
customers would continue making payments.
   General Development's president, Thomas J. Hutchison,
characterized the program as the "first major step in
establishing a reorganization plan which will allow General
Development to emerge from bankruptcy."

COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (CFT)
</GV>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- In a blistering opinion, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission threw out a Cotton Exchange fine against a
futures trader for allegedly disruptive behavior.
   The problem?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It seems that the exchange's tiny Financial Instrument
Exchange division ignored testimony that the trader made an
offer -- not a bid -- in a disputed trade in the Finex's
dollar-index pit.
   No matter that the fine against the trader, Gary Fusfield,
was a mere $100. Said the CFTC in its harshly worded order:
"The magnitude of the exchange's error is not reduced by the
relatively trivial size of the fine."
   Futures exchanges increasingly have policed their pits for
abusive trading behavior following last year's federal probe
of futures trading practices at the two big Chicago
exchanges. But the Finex case is unusual because of the
exchange's apparent blunder -- and because the CFTC tossed
out the fine without remanding it to the exchange for further
review.
   "Because exchanges are under the gun to find violations,
it's become a bit of a numbers game," says Thomas Russo, a
New York lawyer who specializes in securities and commodities
law.
   The Finex declined to comment.
   The case stemmed from a disputed trade made by Mr.
Fusfield in March 1989. James Cahill, Finex floor committee
member, accused Mr. Fusfield of bidding -- or seeking to buy
futures contracts -- below Mr. Cahill's existing bid in the
dollar-index pit, and fined him $100. Such a low-ball bid
would have violated exchange rules.
   But in an affidavit filed with the exchange, Mr. Fusfield
insisted he made an offer -- to sell contracts -- at a price
slightly above the bid. Another witness in the pit verified
Mr. Fusfield's version of events.
   The Finex, however, ignored that testimony in issuing a
decision affirming the fine, the CFTC said.
   In its opinion, the CFTC called Finex's record of the
events "materially misleading," adding that its "reckless
disregard for an orderly and accurate procedure has made
review of its results impossible, and undermined confidence
in that result."
   In an unusual twist, the CFTC also refused to remand the
matter back to the Finex because it said the exchange's
disciplinary procedure was faulty.
   Mr. Fusfield, who termed the Finex review a "star-chamber
proceeding" in papers filed with the CFTC, said his
floor-brokerage business has folded. He now is a computer
consultant.

<TEXT>
   Sick children are among the toughest cases hospitals
handle. Scared, in pain and separated from home and parents,
young patients can get worse even though medicine says they
should get better. But thanks to 50 employees of a GTE Corp.
unit in Waltham, Mass., patients at Boston's Children's
Hospital now have an antidote to sick room blues: the
computer.
   Calling their project KidBits, the GTE Laboratories
employees have given about 10,000 hours of their own time
over the past three years to teach hospitalized children how
to use personal computers. The machines, donated by GTE, are
a therapeutic diversion for many hospitalized children, who
use them to play games, and a welcome communications tool for
those few youngsters whose illnesses or injuries confine them
to sterile isolation rooms.
   KidBits volunteers mostly help out on evenings or
weekends, though their employer lets them run quarterly
workday "computer fairs" for their young charges. "The GTE
people have made an outstanding contribution to our
department and to our patients and their families," says Myra
Fox, director of the hospital's patient activity department.
"They have extended themselves in a most unique volunteer
capacity."
   KidBits was started in 1987 by George Boggs, a GTE
research psychologist, after hearing of a friend's concern
for the morale of an 11-year-old nephew who had been in a
hospital isolation room for two months following a bone
marrow transplant.
   Mr. Boggs contacted hospital administrators, volunteering
to develop a computer-communications system for the young
patients. At first, the hospital staff was skeptical, citing
possible problems of patient safety, privacy and security.
But Mr. Boggs, who believes isolation slows a child patient's
recovery, persisted and won support from Ms. Fox.
   Although Mr. Boggs since has left GTE to join another
company, KidBits continues. There is, for example, Michael
Hackney, a 32-year-old chemist working on ceramics for auto
engines, who has averaged two hours a week over the past
three years teaching computer techniques to a total of 75
children. An easy-mannered and cheerful man, Mr. Hackney
instructs the children in such things as designing
computerized get-well cards for their other friends at the
hospital.
   KidBits' first installation was a voice system which
allowed children to dial up riddles on their hospital room
phone. Later, the KidBits volunteers trained 30 hospital
therapists to use the computers so that they, in turn, could
train the sick children. The GTE-sponsored computer fairs at
the hospital draw many of the KidBits volunteers. "You really
get something back when you see these sick kids giggling as
they help Snoopy escape the Red Baron on their computer
screens," says Rebecca Hudson, an active KidBit leader.
   But the most time-consuming project of the GTE crew has
been the development of a computer system that links a
network of four germ-free rooms to an activity room. This
system provides both communication and entertainment for the
young patients, who may have to stay in the isolated room for
six to 12 weeks. The first of these systems, eventually to be
installed in 13 rooms, began operation last month.
   David Fay, a GTE Labs psychologist, spent 15 evening hours
over a recent two-week span to help wire together the first
two rooms in the new system. "It makes me feel good to do
something with my professional skills {that has} a positive
impact on someone needing help," he says.

   Reynolds Metals Co. said it will introduce a non-stick
microwave wrap.
   The Richmond, Va., aluminum company said the product,
which will be in stores in the Midwest next week, will be the
first paper food-wrap designed exclusively for microwave use.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Microwave cooking typically uses paper towels or waxed
paper, which tend to rip easily, or plastic wraps, which tend
to sag and stick to dishes and food in the microwave.
   First Brands Inc. came out with Glad Microwave Wrap, a
plastic-based wrap, but when it sagged under the oven's heat,
so did its sales.
   Reynolds says its product, a result of six years of
research, won't sag, tear, pick up grease or stick to food
and containers. "You can even cook cheese on it," says John
M. Lowrie, vice president of the company's consumer products
unit.
   Mr. Lowrie said the product, which will look like freezer
paper and have a coating of fatty acid, will be available
nationwide within a year. He predicts the wrap will have
sales of $20 million in its first year.

   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
charged three people with insider trading in connection with
a 1988 bid by MAI Basic Four Inc. to acquire Prime Computer
Inc.
   In a complaint filed in federal court in Los Angeles, the
SEC charged that Dale Jabour, Ronald Lee Thurman and Winston
Cheong bought Prime Computer call options after learning that
MAI was considering an attempt to acquire Prime. All three
were employees at MAI at the time of the discussions, the SEC
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suit charged that Mr. Jabour, who was director of
accounting at MAI in 1988, overheard an MAI executive officer
tell another executive that the company was engaged in
discussions concerning Prime Computer. Mr. Jabour later
learned that any "significant corporate event" with respect
to MAI and Prime Computer would take place after the Nov. 8,
1988, presidential election, the SEC said.
   The complaint alleged that Mr. Jabour passed on the
information to Messrs. Thurman and Cheong. All three
subsequently bought call options in Prime Computer in
violation of their duty to MAI, the SEC said.
   Without admitting or denying the charges, the three men
agreed to final judgments under which they would be enjoined
from further violations of securities laws and Mr. Thurman
would be required to disgorge $1,875 and Mr. Cheong to
disgorge $3,830 in alleged profits from their trades. Mr.
Jabour previously returned profit of $21,800 to the sellers
of the options.
   The judgments, which are pending before the court, also
call for the three to pay to the Treasury civil fines equal
to their alleged profits.
   Messrs. Jabour, Thurman and Cheong couldn't immediately be
reached for comment.
   In August 1989, Prime Computer was acquired by J.H.
Whitney &amp; Co.

   Egghead Inc. posted net income for its fiscal first
quarter ended July 21 of $2.1 million, or 13 cents a share,
continuing the company's improved performance.
   The profit included a gain of $569,000 on the sale of the
company's training center and a charge of $1 million for
reserves to cover actual and anticipated legal expenses. In
the year-ago period, Egghead had a loss of $5.2 million, or
32 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Egghead, one of the nation's largest retailers of computer
software, had a loss of $12.1 million for 1990 despite a
rapid expansion; for the second half of the year, however,
the Issaquah, Wash., company had small but increasing
profits.
   The improvements partially stem from the closure of
marginal stores and Egghead's heavier reliance on direct
sales to customers, which contributed 58% of Egghead's
revenue in the first quarter.
   Egghead's sales grew 18% to $144.7 million, compared with
$122.3 million a year ago.

said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The systems will be available in September 1991, with a
monthly rental fee of about 79 million yen ($550,156) for the
VP2200/40 and of about 103 million yen for the VP2400/40.
   The other enhancements are intended to respond to
increased user demands for large-scale program processing
involving simulations, Fujitsu said.
   In a separate announcement, Fujitsu disclosed the release
of the UXP/M operating system for the VP2000 series
supercomputers and M series of mainframes, the first
mainframe computer adaptation of Unix System V Release 4. The
SVR4 is the latest standard for the Unix operating system.
   Fujitsu said it plans to adopt the Unix SVR4 standard for
all its Unix products.
   Basic software for UXP/M is scheduled to be delivered next
April, with a monthly rental fee beginning at 210,000 yen.

   Pittsburgh National Bank, a unit of PNC Financial Corp.,
said it paid $100,000 of back pay to 13 employees to settle
charges by federal regulators that the bank discriminated
against minority job applicants.
   Pittsburgh National said it didn't discriminate, but that
it didn't maintain adequate records to prove that its hiring
policies didn't violate federal regulations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Examiners from the Office of Federal Contract Compliance
Programs said Pittsburgh National hired a lower proportion of
minority applicants than white applicants for clerical
positions.
   The bank said more of the minority applicants may have
applied at times when the bank had no openings, or they may
have requested full-time jobs when the bank had only
part-time positions available. However, the bank didn't note
on each job application why the applicant didn't obtain a
job, and thus was unable to prove that it hadn't
discriminated, said Wilbur E. Hines, senior vice president,
personnel.
   As part of the settlement, the bank hired 13 minority job
applicants who previously hadn't obtained jobs and split the
$100,000 of back pay among them, Mr. Hines said. Also, the
bank improved its record-keeping to ensure that it can
document its compliance with anti-discrimination rules, he
said.

technology, commercial products and financial services,
awarded AT&amp;T a three-year contract to provide inbound and
outbound voice and data communications to more than 500
domestic locations. Textron wouldn't release the contract's
value, but said it would save Textron about $2.5 million in
annual communications costs.

   Syntex Corp. fiscal fourth-quarter net income rose 49% to
$75.1 million, reflecting generally strong demand for its
most profitable products and the performance of four
prescription drugs introduced in the U.S. this year.
   In the period ended July 31, the Palo Alto, Calif.,
company had per-share net of 67 cents a share, compared with
46 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Profit a year
ago totaled $50.4 million. Revenue gained 24% to $397.3
million from $321.1 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Syntex said the profit gain also reflected expense
controls. The four drugs Syntex introduced this year are
Toradol, Synarel, Cardene and Cytoven.
   In the year, net grew 13% to $341.5 million, or $3.05 a
share, up from $303.2 million, or $2.67 a share. Revenue was
$1.52 billion, up 13% from $1.35 billion.

   James River Corp. posted a fiscal first-quarter loss of
$84.8 million, or $1.11 a share, after taking a charge of
about $143.6 million, or $1.76 a share, to restructure its
operations.
   In the year-ago quarter, the paper-products maker had
profit of $57 million, or 64 cents a share, including
one-time items that resulted in a net gain of $800,000, or
one cent a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   James River announced the reorganization plan earlier this
month, and the loss for the first quarter, which ended July
29, was generally in line with analysts' expectations. As
part of the plan, the company intends to sell or shut down
operations with sales of $1.3 billion.
   The Richmond, Va., company said revenue for the quarter
was $1.42 billion, compared with $1.48 billion in the
year-ago period.
   James River said earnings dropped in its communications
papers division due to continued low prices for uncoated
freesheet papers, but its towel and tissue division posted a
"significant" increase in earnings.
   The company's specialty papers division also posted an
earnings gain. James River has agreed to sell 80% of the
division to a new company controlled by AEA Investors Inc.
and a management group.

   Commodities:
   Oil Prices Plunge on OPEC Pact to Lift Output,
   Perception That Mideast Tensions Are Easing

   HOUSTON -- Crude oil prices fell sharply following an OPEC
agreement to raise production and a growing perception among
market participants that Middle East tensions were easing.
   Ten of the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries agreed to raise output immediately to
help replace the four million barrels of oil taken off the
market because of the embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti petroleum.
Market estimates varied as to how much oil OPEC could quickly
put on the market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil for October delivery fell $1.96 a barrel to
$25.92 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest level
in nearly three weeks. So far this week the contract has
dropped about $5 a barrel, or 16%, as financial markets
increasingly believe the chances for Mideast hostilities have
lessened.
   "The crude market weakened on perceptions of a moderating
Persian Gulf crisis," said Andrew Lebow, a crude oil analyst
with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc. He said a number
of news reports pointed to the "potential for a peaceful
solution."
   A number of traders said Iraq's promise to release women
and children held hostage, followed quickly by praise from
the U.S. government for the move, was one sign of easing
tensions. Market participants also pointed to reports that
Iraq had made behind-the-scenes peace overtures to the U.S.
   And in a market looking to go lower, even news that was
several days old was cited as a factor, such as the planned
meeting between the U.N. Secretary General and Iraq's foreign
minister, scheduled for today.
   Among OPEC members, the country that has sizable spare
capacity that could ratchet up production quickly is Saudi
Arabia. Traders were expecting that country to produce an
extra two million barrels a day, with enough output from
other OPEC nations to replace a total of three million to 3.5
million of the lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti production.
   But some reports on the New York Merc said Saudi Arabia
already was producing an extra two million barrels a day and
could produce one million beyond that by the end of the year,
for a total output as high as 8.5 million barrels daily. Some
people remained skeptical, however. "They've been working on
projects to upgrade production capacity, but 8.5 million is a
very high number," Mr. Lebow said.
   Gasoline prices also were off yesterday, in sympathy with
crude declines. Gasoline for September delivery finished at
84.72 cents a gallon, down 3.81.
   Heating oil fell sharply, with the September contract down
7.88 cents a gallon to 71.64 cents. A sharp buildup in
inventories reported Tuesday afternoon by the American
Petroleum Institute depressed prices. "Heating oil seems to
be in adequate supply right now," one trader said.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of many corn, wheat and
soybean futures contracts sank for the third consecutive day
in the absence of any threatening developments in the Middle
East. Last week, grain prices rose on speculation that any
prolonged climb in oil prices would enable oil-producing
nations to import more U.S. grain. "The market is taking out
the war premium," said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice
president at Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago. Crop prices are
also being depressed by good growing weather in the Midwest.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices eased. The October contract was off
0.42 cent a pound at 11.05 cents and dropped at one point
below 11 cents. According to one analyst, the drop was a
delayed reaction to the softness that has hit many commodity
markets as fears of a war in the Middle East have eased.
There are no new developments concerning the current sugar
beet crop in Europe, the analyst said. Moderate but steady
demand for sugar in the world market from Mideast countries
has been curtailed by the crisis in that area, the analyst
said.
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: Most futures contracts dropped their daily
permissible limits. Contract months from November forward
declined their daily limit of five cents a pound; November
ended at $1.5330. The soon-to-expire September contract,
which can rise or fall as much as 10 cents a pound from its
previous close, was down as much as eight cents a pound at
one point before partially recovering to end 5.95 cents lower
at $1.6345. Contributing to selling in the September contract
is the fact that Tuesday will be the first day on which
notices will be issued to deliver the concentrate against
September futures, an analyst said. Concentrate prices have
been under pressure because retail demand has slowed in the
face of price advances caused by damage to the Florida citrus
crop by last December's freeze. The lower prices might help
to revive some consumer demand, the analyst said. However,
supply concerns have been alleviated by a
better-than-expected crop this year in Florida and
expectations that new-crop Brazilian supplies will soon be
available, which could create further pressure on prices, the
analyst said.

   COCOA: Futures prices declined. The December contract was
off $31 a metric ton to $1,249. Analysts following
fundamentals said that rain in the Ivory Coast has eased
fears that recent dryness would hurt the crop, although one
analyst said the rains were light and scattered and weren't a
major factor. "The market fell back because there was little
reason for it to have advanced in the first place," she said.
John Gambino, a senior futures technical analyst for Merrill
Lynch, said that on a purely technical basis, the drop in the
December contract to $1,100 a ton in mid-August from $1,560
in May was simply a correction of the market's rally from
$960 to $1,560 between last December and May. Now, Mr.
Gambino said, "Prices may have bottomed out and could be
setting the stage for the renewal of the bull move." The
downward trend, he said, "fits into a classic three-wave
correction" that he now believes is complete. According to
that scenario, he said, the recent low of $1,100 "marks the
resumption of the bull market that began last December."

   Bonds Rally on Strong Bidding at 5-Year Auction
   And Hints of Easing in Persian Gulf Tensions

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices rallied yesterday, boosted by
strong bidding at the Treasury's five-year note auction and
signs of less tension in the Mideast.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year note ended nearly 1 1/4
points higher, a gain of nearly $12.50 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction of its price, eased to 8.92% from 9.04% on
Tuesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices opened modestly higher on news that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to raise
output levels. But a late-day rally in the Treasury futures
pit at the Chicago Board of Trade spilled over into the cash
market and pushed bond prices sharply higher.
   The futures market rally was sparked by the release of the
government's five-year note auction results, which were
better than some analysts had expected.
   The $8.56 billion of five-year, two-month notes fetched an
average yield of 8.57%. The yield was up from 8.54% at the
previous 5-year, 2-month note auction May 24 and was the
highest average yield at an auction since May 25, 1989, when
the average yield was 8.72%. In when-issued trading activity,
the yield on the five-year notes fell to 8.5%.
   The bid-to-cover ratio, which measures the number of bids
the Treasury receives for each bid it accepts, was a hefty
3.10-to-1, compared with 2.53-to-1 at the last five-year
auction.
   Noncompetitive bids, a gauge of individual investor
interest, were $672 million. That was up from $593 million at
the pervious five-year auction in May and the highest since
$696 million at the February 1989 five-year note auction.
   Those results seemed to indicate investors were warming
somewhat to fixed-income securities after weeks of sitting
frozen by fear of what the Middle East crisis would do to oil
prices and inflation.
   And news from and about the Mideast standoff suggested
conciliation was more a possibility than had been perceived.
   The Iraqi ambassador to the U.S. told reporters Iraq would
release all male foreigners, as well as women and children,
if the U.S. would assure it wouldn't attack Iraq.
   And an article in Newsday said that a purported
intermediary for Iraq made a secret offer to evacuate Kuwait
if it received guaranteed access to the Persian Gulf and
control of an oil field that dips into Kuwait, among other
conditions.
   Later in the day, the White House dismissed the proposal
and said it hadn't had any direct dealings with Iraq.
   "There were elements of constructiveness in the air and a
sense that investors don't have to build in a worst-case
scenario," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc., New York.
   Fixed-income securities also were helped by the drop in
oil prices, which reflected the OPEC announcement. OPEC
nations, with Iran dissenting, agreed to boost production to
help make up for the embargo against crude from Iraq and
occupied Kuwait.
   The announcement sent oil prices tumbling. At the New York
Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for October delivery settled
at $25.92, down $1.96 from Tuesday.
   A drop in the Commodity Research Bureau's futures index
was also constructive to market tone. The CRB index settled
at 234.71, down 3.66 on the day, reflecting widespread price
declines in futures markets.
   Analysts said soybeans, corn and wheat futures all took a
tumble, as did orange juice, sugar, coffee and cocoa futures.
The grain futures led the declines, with some corn contracts
hitting life-of-contract lows.
   On the economic calendar for today is the weekly release
of initial unemployment claims at 8:30 a.m. EDT and the
release of July factory orders at 10 a.m. EDT.
   A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report consensus of economists
looks for an increase of 1.5% in factory orders after a 1.5%
decline in June.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury securities ended higher yesterday, after a rally
in the Treasury futures market spilled over into the cash
market.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 98 5/32 to
yield 8.92% compared with 96 30/32 to yield 9.04% on Tuesday.
The latest 10-year notes ended at 99 18/32 to yield 8.80%
compared with 98 26/32 to yield 8.91%.
   Short-term rates eased slightly yesterday. The discount
rate on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.47% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.70% while the rate on six-month
Treasury bills fell to 7.44% for a bond-equivalent yield of
7.82%.
   Here are details of yesterday's five-year, two-month note
auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   The notes are dated Sept. 4, 1990, and mature Nov. 15,
1995.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Junk bonds ambled along in another day of uninspiring
summer trading.
   Prices of most go-go bonds, or top-quality, liquid
high-yield names, ended the session slightly higher, but junk
bonds from retailers and other cyclical issuers continued to
come under heavy selling pressure.
   Hard hit were junk bonds of R.H. Macy &amp; Co. and Carter
Hawley Hale Stores Inc. Macy's 14.50% senior subordinated
debentures slipped two points to 59 while the retailer's
14.50% subordinated debentures also slumped two points to end
at 46.
   Carter Hawley's 12.50% senior subordinated debentures slid
two points to 69 while the company's 12.25% senior
subordinated notes shed 1 1/2 points to end at 74.
   With recession looming, investors have been selling junk
bonds of retailers on fears that profits will be squeezed in
an economic downturn.
   Some other cyclical bonds that were hammered in
yesterday's trading: National Gypsum Co.'s 11.375% senior
subordinated notes, which fell two points to an offered price
of 43. Bids for the company's 14.50% senior subordinated
debentures tumbled four points to 36.
   Yesterday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered the debt
ratings of National Gypsum because the decline in demand for
gypsum wallboard prices will continue to erode the company's
already skimpy interest coverage.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds posted gains with long-term bonds advancing
as much as 3/4 point.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bond prices perked up after the doldrums of
recent weeks and wrapped up the calm session with gains of
1/4 to 1 1/2 points.
   New deals that came to the market this session were well
received, traders said.
   The top attraction was Puerto Rico's $350 million Public
Improvement Bonds of 1990.
   The general obligation bonds were priced by a Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. group to yield from 6.15% in 1991 to 7.735% in
2020.
   In secondary dealings, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issues of 2018 ended 1 1/2 points higher at 98 1/2,
pushing the yield down to 7.31% from 7.44% at Tuesday's
close.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage- &amp; Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   The asset-backed securities market reached another
milestone as nearly $26 billion of asset-backed issues have
been sold so far this year, exceeding the $24 billion sold in
all of 1989. This month alone, nearly $4 billion of
asset-backed securities have been issued.
   "We really expect asset-backed issuance to remain heavy,"
said Bruce Mahood, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co.
   That's because issuers, especially banks, continue to step
up their sales while investors avidly seek the high-rated
securities that offer yields generally 0.55 to 0.90
percentage point higher than short-term Treasurys.
   With total issuance of $14 billion, sales of credit-card
securities dominate this year's asset-backed market and the
trend is expected to persist.
   But issuance of securities backed by auto loans may
slacken due to slow auto sales. Some automakers "aren't in
the market because their auto-loan portfolio has not grown
that spectacularly," said Michael Bassett, vice president at
Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
   There are just two forthcoming asset-backed deals now
being mentioned repeatedly -- both credit-card issues. One is
a $300 million offering by Valley National Bank via J.P.
Morgan. Valley National is a unit of Phoenix, Ariz.-based
Valley National Corp. The other issue is $500 million Signet
Banking Corp. via Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. Signet is based in
Richmond, Va.
   Another name being bandied about is Baltimore-based MNC
Financial Inc., which is seen selling about $500 million of
credit-card securities later this quarter or early next
quarter.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese bond market eroded further on continued talk
of an imminent hike in the official discount rate and a
weaker yen.
   Two Japanese national newspapers reported yesterday that
the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance were
negotiating a discount rate hike. The reports, which were
denied by government officials, said the discount rate could
be raised as much as one full point as early as the beginning
of September. The rate, which is what the central bank
charges member banks for loans, now is 5.25%.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno denied that the
central bank and the Finance Ministry were negotiating
another rate increase, but emphasized that the rise in the
price of oil was a new factor that the central bank was
carefully watching.
   Despite Mr. Mieno's denial, many dealers and analysts
believe there will be a discount rate increase by October.
   "I think they will hike the discount rate," says a dealer
at a major Japanese commercial bank. "They only have
September to do it in. If they don't {do it in September}
they will have missed the right time. . . . I think they are
deciding the scheduling."
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark
No. 119 10-year government bond was quoted at a price of
82.18, down 0.55 point on the day, to yield 8.31%. (Foreign
bond yields are quoted here in local terms and therefore
differ somewhat from yields calculated for these markets by
U.S. investment firms, which tend to use the semiannual
compound measure to compare yields across markets. Using that
method, the yield on Japan's No. 119 bond ended at 7.61%,
according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   The discount rate was last raised in late March by a full
percentage point to 5.25%.
   In other markets:
   -- West German bond prices ended on a firmer tone despite
being faced with as much as 10 billion marks ($6.43 billion)
of fresh supply due for pricing in the next week.
   -- British government bonds ended little changed.

   A federal appeals court in Los Angeles upheld the
dismissal of a libel suit against CBS commentator Andy Rooney
stemming from statements he made during a broadcast two years
ago.
   It is thought to be the first such decision by a federal
appeals court since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last June
that statements of opinion are not necessarily immune from
defamation suits.

   In an April 1988 television broadcast on the CBS
newsmagazine show "60 Minutes", Mr. Rooney held up a bottle
of "Rain-X," a chemical sealant used to protect cars from
rain, snow and ice, and said he spent an hour putting it on
his car windshield after receiving a free sample in the mail.
   "I suppose he'd like a commercial or a testimonial," Mr.
Rooney scoffed, speaking of Rain-X's manufacturer, Unelco
Corp., in Scottsdale, Ariz. "You know how they hold the
product up like this? It didn't work."
   Unelco's suit, filed in May 1988, was dismissed by a
federal judge in Phoenix on the ground that Mr. Rooney's
comments were protected opinion. But the case was under
appeal in Los Angeles when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in
June that commentary is protected only if it is clearly
presented as an opinion -- not as objective fact.
   Following that standard, the Circuit Court of Appeals in
Los Angeles found that Mr. Rooney's comments fell in the
latter category. The appeal panel dismissed the case,
however, on the ground that Unelco failed to establish that
Mr. Rooney's comments were false.
   Chicago attorney Robert P. Cummins, who represented
Unelco, said the appeal court judges were correct in finding
Mr. Rooney's comments potentially defamatory, but said the
court's analysis of whether his comments reflected the truth
"missed the mark."
   "We did not have an opportunity to develop a record that
could be objectively scrutinized," said Mr. Cummins, adding
that he plans to ask the full appeals court for a rehearing.
   The decision was only a partial victory for CBS Inc. "It
has always been our belief that these were not statements of
fact, but that they were inherently unreliable comments
because they reflect Mr. Rooney's personal experience with
the product," said Heddy Gold, in-house litigation counsel
for CBS in New York.

   INCREASES IN COMPENSATION for general counsel appear to
slow.
   Attorneys who head corporate legal departments got healthy
pay increases this year, but a sluggish economy apparently is
reducing the size of the compensation boosts.
   A recent Ernst &amp; Young survey of 700 U.S. companies found
that they are paying their general counsel an average 8% more
in salary and bonus this year than in 1989. Last year,
general counsel got average increases of about 10%, Ernst &amp;
Young says.
   "The pay is going up, but it's a far cry from the
double-digit increases we saw in the mid-1980s," says Robert
J. Berkow, national director of a law firm consulting at
Ernst &amp; Young, New York. "It's a reflection of what's going
on in the economy."
   Ernst &amp; Young made the annual survey in conjunction with
the Association of the Bar of the City of New York and the
American Corporate Counsel Association, Washington, D.C.
Formal results won't be published for about two weeks.
   A previously published survey by Of Counsel, a legal trade
publication, reported a similar slowing of compensation
increases for top legal officers at 170 public companies. It
showed an increase of 10.6% compared with 12.5% the year
earlier. Some attorneys believe that the slowing trend may
continue because of corporate worries about a recession.
   "I'd be surprised if it's 10% next year -- real
surprised," says Stephen Bokat, vice president and general
counsel of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington, D.C. But
other legal experts believe the longer-term pay prospects are
strong. "I think the trend for the '90s looks good," says
Paul Roy, a vice president of Hildebrandt Inc., Somerville,
N.J., a legal consulting firm.
   Not surprisingly, compensation appears to vary with the
size of a company's legal department. The general counsel
overseeing a one or two-person operation received
compensation averaging $124,000, the Ernst &amp; Young study
shows.
   That rose to $420,000 for general counsel supervising
staffs of 51 to 99 lawyers and $516,000 for general counsel
with staffs of more than 100 attorneys.

   RACKETEERING CHARGE filed against company headed by James
H. Guerin.
   Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia have filed a
racketeering charge against Parent Industries Inc., a holding
company headed by Mr. Guerin, a military equipment contractor
who turned a backyard security and electronics firm in
Lancaster, Pa., into a global weapons conglomerate.
   The charge, filed as an information in federal court in
Philadelphia, alleges that Parent Industries participated in
a scheme to create more than $1 billion in phony weapons
contracts to inflate the value of International Signal &amp;
Control Corp., a maker of hi-tech military hardware that Mr.
Guerin started in 1971.
   Mr. Guerin sold ISC to Ferranti International PLC,
Britain's third-largest military contractor, for $670 million
in 1987, but Ferranti has since claimed that it was duped in
the deal. Last year, Ferranti wrote off $365 million, more
than half its net worth.
   A criminal information is an alternative to an indictment
and is usually filed after the subject of an investigation
has agreed to plead guilty. Last May, Parent Industries
agreed to plead guilty to one count of racketeering and pay
the government $4.4 million in fines and criminal
forfeitures.
   Mr. Guerin himself hasn't been charged with a crime.
Neither he nor his attorney Joseph Tate, with the
Philadelphia law firm of Schnader, Harrison, Segal &amp; Lewis,
could be reached for comment yesterday.
   Mr. Guerin has been under investigation for two years, but
the information is the first criminal charge filed in the
case. Federal prosecutors said the investigation is
continuing.

   HOW LOW may the police fly when searching for drugs?
   Above 50 feet if they're searching by helicopter, the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ruled. The court reversed the
conviction of a Bucks County, Pa., man who was spotted
through a skylight in his roof growing marijuana in 1985.
   The decision is thought to be the first in the country
since the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the issue of aerial
drug searches last year. But the 15-page decision leaves
unclear how low police helicopters can fly in the
surveillance of homes and private property of criminal
suspects.
   Police in the Bucks County case descended to 50 feet from
500 feet and made three passes, rattling windows and shaking
the house, to confirm that the plants seen through the
skylight were marijuana, according to the decision. The court
ruled that the flights constituted an unreasonable search
because they "represented a hazard to person and property on
the ground."
   But the decision doesn't explain what legal standards --
public safety or an individual's right to an expectation of
privacy -- should decide the issue. Last year, the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a Pasco County, Fla.,
man who was arrested after local sheriff's deputies flying at
400 feet spotted marijuana growing in his greenhouse. But
that case, in which the court was sharply divided, also
didn't set limits on how intrusive aerial searches can be.
   Assistant Bucks County District Attorney Gary Gambardella
said he plans to ask the Pennsylvania high court for a
rehearing and may appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

   VICTIMS OF A CRIPPLING DISEASE sue Kodak over diagnostic
dye.
   Eastman Kodak Co. and other companies are being sued by
300 plaintiffs who say they were crippled by Pantopaque, a
dye used to diagnose back and spinal injuries. The
class-action suit was filed in federal court in Newark, N.J.
   According to the plaintiffs' attorney, N. Scott Rosenblum,
a partner at the Clayton, Mo., law firm Wittner, Poger &amp;
Rosenblum, his clients were never told they were risking
chronic pain, paraplegia or death from an incurable disease
known as arachnoiditis when they allowed doctors to inject
Pantopaque into their spinal systems. The plaintiffs are
asking for more than $15 million in damages.
   A spokesman for Kodak said the company's lawyers hadn't
seen the complaint and declined to comment.
   Lawyers for the other accused firms, Alcon Pharmaceutical
Laboratories Inc., Austin, Texas; Lafayette Pharmaceutical
Inc., Fort Worth, Texas; and defunct Lafayette Pharmacal
Inc., Indianapolis, could not be reached for comment.

   CLASS ACTION SUIT challenges Illinois lethal injection
procedure.
   Lawyers representing death-row prisoners in Illinois have
asked federal Judge James B. Zagel to halt all executions in
the state until the courts determine whether an unauthorized
chemical, potassium chloride, can be used with two others
specified by state statute for lethal injections. The state
plans to begin executions on Sept. 12.
   Lawyers from the MacArthur Justice Center and the Chicago
law firm Sonnenschein Nath &amp; Rosenthal filed a class-action
suit on behalf of about 130 prisoners challenging the
Illinois Department of Corrections' execution procedures.
Sonnenschein partner Charles Altschuler said there is a
substantial risk that the proposed injection procedure will
"inflict torture" before it kills.
   A spokesman for the Illinois State Attorney's office would
not comment on the substance of the case.

   CBS Inc. litigation counsel Heddy Gold said CBS
commentator Andy Rooney's statements in a broadcast about a
product he sampled weren't deemed fact but were "inherently
unverifiable comments, because they reflect Mr. Rooney's
personal experience with the product." Ms. Gold was
incorrectly quoted in an item in yesterday's Legal Beat
column about the dismissal of a libel suit against Mr.
Rooney.

   Saddam Damps Hopes of Early Accord;
   U.S. Rushes More Weapons to Saudis

   WASHINGTON -- Saddam Hussein damped hopes there might be a
quick negotiated settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis, as
the U.S. announced that it was rushing jet fighters, tanks
and Stinger missiles to Saudi Arabia.
   In an interview on CBS television, the Iraqi president
said, "Kuwait is part of Iraq," and he denied reports that he
had offered any concessions to the U.S. to defuse the
standoff in the Gulf. At the same time, he tried to sound a
conciliatory tone, asserting that he was "prepared to conduct
a dialogue" with President Bush and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.

<TEXT>
   Even when asked provocative questions, including one about
the comparison President Bush drew between him and Adolf
Hitler, Saddam Hussein remained calm and spoke in carefully
measured terms. But at one point he did show a flash of anger
toward Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, an outspoken Arab
critic of the Iraqi invasion, saying Mr. Mubarak "no longer
is a friend."
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials last night said they were still
waiting for Saddam Hussein to fulfill his promise to release
U.S. women and children who have been held hostage in Iraq
and Kuwait. Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department
spokeswoman, said Baghdad asked U.S. officials for the names
of those who want to leave in order to give them exit visas.
She said: "We are responding to that request." If Iraq lets
these foreigners go, she said, it would be "a significant
step in the right direction."
   Saddam Hussein's combination of defiant statements and
promises, in the view of a senior State Department official,
is part of a campaign to buy time in hopes of sowing disunity
among the nations that are arrayed against Iraq. In addition
to his interview with CBS News anchorman Dan Rather, the
Iraqi dictator appeared yesterday on French television.
   There were reports yesterday that the Bush administration
had received a number of overtures from intermediaries
claiming to represent Iraq. But the White House denied that
it has received any direct offer from Baghdad.
   One report, in the Long Island, N.Y., newspaper Newsday,
said that an unidentified official from a past U.S.
administration suggested recently to National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft that Iraq might be willing to
withdraw its troops from Kuwait on the following conditions:
an end to United Nations sanctions, guaranteed access to the
Persian Gulf and ownership of a disputed oil field on the
Iraq-Kuwait border.
   The White House confirmed that such a meeting occurred.
But a spokesman said, "There was nothing in this particular
proposal that merited its pursuit." It was unclear where the
ideas originated.
   The Bush administration, meanwhile, is sending tough
signals to Saddam Hussein. In a radio message to U.S. forces
sweltering in Saudi Arabia's desert, President Bush said,
"Nobody's feeling the heat more than the government in
Baghdad." Separately, NBC News reported last night that the
U.S. is providing intelligence and training to the Kuwaiti
resistance movement, which it said is mounting daily
guerrilla raids inside the occupied country.
   The administration also confirmed that it is selling about
$2.3 billion of weapons to Saudi Arabia, including 24 F-15
aircraft, 150 M-60 tanks, 50 Stinger anti-aircraft launchers
and missiles and 150 spare Stinger missiles and 1,500 rounds
of depleted uranium anti-tank ammunition.
   The White House signaled that the arms sale is just the
beginning of a broader U.S. effort to arm the Saudis. "We are
also looking at additional arms sales in the near term and
long range to help provide the Saudis with the force
structure necessary to help them defend themselves," said a
White House spokesman.
   A group of U.S. Jewish leaders met recently with Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney and expressed support for the
administration's policy, including its decision to provide
"assistance for the defense of Saudi Arabia, to deal with the
present emergency," according to a statement released by the
group.
   But the prospect of a continued military buildup in Saudi
Arabia is creating some concern among Israel's supporters in
the U.S. An official at Aipac, the major pro-Israel lobbying
group, said yesterday that Jewish leaders are worried that
the weapons being sent to the Saudis someday could be turned
against Israel. "It's simply an objective fact that this
stuff will be a substantial problem for Israel in the
future," he said.
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials said they see little basis for
negotiating with Iraq in the reported unofficial feelers that
are surfacing in Washington.
   The U.S. would be loath to grant Iraq possession of an oil
field in return for a withdrawal from Kuwait, for instance,
because such a concession would be seen as a reward for Iraqi
aggression. In addition, an Iraqi request for guaranteed
"access" to the Persian Gulf is widely viewed as a disguised
demand for possession of strategic Bubiyan Island -- a
Kuwaiti island just beyond the mouth of the narrow Shatt
alrab waterway, now Iraq's only path to the Gulf. Iraq has
long coveted the island, but Kuwait has refused to consider
giving it up.
   The flurry of reports about possible Iraqi offers precedes
a meeting between United Nations Secretary General Javier
Perez de Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
scheduled for today in Jordan. The U.S. has said it approves
of that meeting, but Washington professes to have little
expectation that it will bring about an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait.
