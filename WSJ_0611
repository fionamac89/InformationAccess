   Solvency Standards for Insurance Firms
   Get Scrutiny of State Regulators' Group

   BALTIMORE -- State regulators, feeling the heat of
congressional oversight and pressure from consumer groups,
are beginning to toughen solvency standards for insurance
companies.
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners met
here last week and adopted several measures designed to help
regulators scrutinize insurers' reserve and capital
requirements as well as their investments in junk bonds. The
group also tightened rules on independent financial audits
and reinsurance practices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The states are paying more attention to the financial
condition of insurance companies because it's more of a
problem," says Richard Stewart, a former New York state
insurance commissioner.
   The recent sharp rise in the number of insurer
insolvencies and the widely publicized problems of some
insurers' junk-bond investments have helped prod state
regulators to act. Also, state agencies are getting much more
attention from Congress. During the past six months, the
General Accounting Office has issued two reports that found
problems in how states monitor property/casualty company
solvency and reinsurance.
   Earl Pomeroy, North Dakota's insurance commissioner and
current president of the national group, concedes that "every
insolvency represents a management failure and a regulatory
failure." He says the parallels drawn between the insurance
industry and the savings and loan crisis, as well as
increased political pressure, served as "a warning shot
across our bow."
   By year end, the commissioners' group has pledged to
consider whether insurance-company investments in certain
areas such as junk bonds and real estate should be limited.
The group also plans to take up the thorny issue of whether
insurers' reserves should better reflect the actual risks in
their mix of businesses.
   Most critical of the states' regulatory efforts so far is
a report issued by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's
panel on oversight and investigations, led by Rep. John
Dingell (D., Mich.). The subcommittee found serious
weaknesses and breakdowns in the current regulatory system.
Among the problems cited: infrequent examinations based on
outdated information, insufficient capital requirements and
licensing procedures, failure to require use of actuaries and
independent audits, and improper influence exerted on
regulators. Inadequate staffing and regulatory resources were
also mentioned.
   Since the passage of the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945,
the states have had the responsibility for regulating the
insurance industry. The association of insurance
commissioners -- representing the 50 states, the District of
Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin
Islands -- has been the traditional vehicle for addressing
solvency issues at the national level. Its role has been to
develop model laws and regulations.
   But the association has no enforcement power. Its model
laws, although usually well-crafted, must be refined and
adopted separately by each state legislature, a practice that
has resulted in some wide differences and inconsistencies.
   The rules adopted last week apply to all states. They
increase the credit-quality categories for insurers' bond
portfolios to six from four. Insurers will now be required to
build larger statutory reserves over a shorter period of time
for lesser-grade bonds. In addition, the commissioners
adopted rules requiring that insurers' loss-reserve
statements be signed by certified actuaries.
   In an effort to measure effectiveness of the state
regulators themselves, the group also approved development of
an audit process. The goal is to determine how good a job
states do in monitoring insurance companies' solvency. Audits
are to begin within the next 12 months. Results will be made
public so that consumers can know which state commissions
have met the national group's standards.
   Mr. Pomeroy says several states are eager to be certified.
But others, including his own state of North Dakota, must
improve internal procedures to qualify.
   The association will also be increasing its oversight
role, taking a look at how individual states are dealing with
problem companies. During the meeting last week, several
states were asked to provide more information about their
efforts to shape up troubled insurers.
   Kenneth Merin, New Jersey's former insurance commissioner,
says the new emphasis on solvency is appropriate. But for
state insurance commissioners to be more effective in their
home states, he says, legislators and governors have to
confront the same problem. Instead, he says, their attention
"is usually focused on the hot consumer issues such as auto
insurance, worker's comp and health insurance."

   Group Wins Funds

   WASHINGTON -- The National Science Foundation and a
Pentagon research agency awarded a three-year, $15.8 million
contract to the Corporation for National Research Initiatives
to conduct research on a possible, ultra high-speed computer
network.
   Charles Brownstein, the NSF's acting assistant director
for computers, said that partners from private industry,
including the regional Bell telephone companies and
International Business Machines Corp., would chip in "many
times" the amount provided by the federal government. The NSF
is sharing the cost of the contract with the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Computer researchers hope the small research contract will
be a precursor to a federal effort to build a $390 million
national computer network that would operate at speeds 1,000
times faster than currently possible. In September, D. Allan
Bromley, President Bush's science adviser, urged building
such a network as part of a proposed $1.92 billion initiative
to advance U.S. supercomputing.
   But Mr. Bromley couldn't win any federal funds for his
plan. Administration and congressional sources say he is
pushing hard to get the administration to provide money for
the initiative for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 1991.
His plan envisions first-year spending of $151 million for
all supercomputing, including $30 million for the network.
   Unlike many proposals for government financing of
commercial research -- for instance, high-definition
television -- the supercomputing initiative hasn't yet run
into opposition from White House economic officials who
oppose government direction of industry. The computer network
is considered the high-technology equivalent of a public
highway and thus hasn't set off ideological alarms.
   The Corporation for National Research Initiatives, a
nonprofit research organization in Reston, Va., plans to use
the contract money to explore alternative designs for the
proposed national network and ways the network could be used.
   One of the possibilities is putting CAT-scan images on
computers so that surgeons could view the images like a
movie-rotating the images as they like, and visually
stripping away layers of tissue.
   The corporation is run by Robert Kahn, a former Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency manager who helped to
develop the U.S.'s first computer network.

   Letters to the Editor:
   Wellesley and Barbara Bush Redux
</HL>
<DATE>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A15
</SO>
<LP>
   In response to Enola G. Aird's May 8 editorial-page
article "Feminism's Skewed Definition at Wellesley": The
debate at Wellesley centered around the appropriateness of
Barbara Bush as a graduation speaker for a group of women who
have completed four years of a unique education. This
education is based on the philosophy that women historically
have made valuable contributions in all areas of society
including business, politics, law, medicine and family.
   Their contributions often have been unnoticed or
unappreciated, but attest endlessly to their abilities.
Wellesley women are encouraged to use their talents and
skills in striving to accomplish whatever their goals and
aspirations may be, regardless of the barriers with which
they are faced. They have become successful writers,
actresses, lawyers, bankers, politicians and educators. In
addition, many have become important community volunteers.
Many of these women are also mothers and homemakers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With so many accomplished women from whom to select, why
then did the students choose Barbara Bush? Mrs. Bush was born
into a wealthy family and dropped out of college to marry
into another fortunate position. Perhaps she is a good
mother. No one doubts her dedication to public service.
However, her ability to give is not based on her own, earned
accomplishments but on those of her husband and her family.
Mrs. Bush's achievements are derived from a class status that
allows her the time, money and luxury to be a full-time
mother and volunteer. I do not mean to belittle her
contributions, for they are noble and valuable. I believe,
however, that her activities did not qualify her to speak to
the graduating class of 1990.

   It's about time we moms at home stood up for ourselves and
Ms. Aird did that beautifully.
   I am sick of living in a community and a country where
snotty feminists are allowed to dominate public opinion with
their narrow outlook. I am a college graduate who gave up
pursuing a second degree to stay home and care for my
children, and few of my "enlightened" professors or fellow
students could understand why I would be content being a
full-time mom. Yet I can't think of a better use for my
learning than to benefit my family. After all, anybody can be
a doctor, lawyer, secretary, etc. these days, but nobody else
can be Mom to my children.
   It is interesting to note that the decline of marriage and
family has paralleled the decline in the number of women at
home. Despite an increased number of college graduates (a
"smarter" population, you might say), families seem to be
suffering more. I await Ms. Aird's "Militant Mothering," but
with such blind and deaf opponents the battle should be easy
to win.
   Barbara L. Wiedenbeck

   Ms. Aird misinterprets the thrust of the protest as
primarily anti-motherhood, misrepresents all Wellesley
students as full of "disdain for women who choose to care for
their children full-time," and ends her convoluted argument
by accusing the protesters of somehow devaluing children. Her
reaction to what she perceives as the protesters' lack of
respect for motherhood is written in an
I'm-not-gonna-take-it-anymore rhetoric usually reserved for
flag-burning, drug-dealing terrorists. But she neglects to
address the point most central to the protest: Although
Barbara Bush is now an advocate of education in her campaigns
for literacy, she dropped out of college to marry her
husband. Because she did not ever complete her college
degree, she is an inappropriate role model for a graduation
ceremony of a women's college. She lacks the one value
obviously shared by the Wellesley Class of '90: a commitment
to women's higher education.

   Ms. Aird has indeed been fortunate in receiving a fine
education, practicing her profession, and being able to be a
full-time mother and serve her community. However, most young
women today do not have those choices.
   My own experience has run the gamut: full-time mother and
community volunteer, three children, back to graduate school,
divorce, and working outside my profession to support my
family. Frankly, although Barbara Bush is an admirable
person, she does not represent a role model to me, my
daughter or her contemporaries. Accomplishments like hers are
celebrated -- when community activists are recognized and on
Mother's Day -- but not at college commencements.
   Let's face it -- women today still have a difficult time
being recognized as equals in so many fields. New graduates
need to hear from women who have faced those obstacles and
triumphed in spite of them. They need that inspiration.
   Kathy Kaufman
   Livermore, Calif.
   ---
   Mrs. Bush's role as the mother at home is fast becoming
obsolete. For me, the alternative of not working has never
been an option, nor has it been, nor will it be, for a
growing portion of American women. Both Mrs. Bush and Ms.
Aird have that option. That is wonderful. But the simple
facts now are that living costs have gone so high that most
families cannot exist on one income. A few months ago, I
listened with amazement when Mrs. Bush told an interviewer on
public radio that women with young children should not be
working for that extra television set. My salary -- I shouted
to the radio -- pays the mortgage] And, I know I am not the
exception.
   So, the real question facing most of the new mothers of
this generation which includes these Wellesley graduates --
is not whether full-time motherhood is a waste of talent.
That is not the issue here. Many of these graduates, like me,
are going to have to continue to work when their children are
born and when they are young. There will be no choice. The
problems that cry out for more attention -- to name a few --
include support from business for the working mother or
father, more child-care options and more job flexibility.

   The trustee for the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway said the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., approved Canadian
Pacific Ltd.'s offer of $25 million for assets of the
railroad, which is in bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   Francis Dicello, the trustee, said the agreement is
subject to negotiation of labor agreements and to regulatory
approval. He said the Bankruptcy Court asked the Interstate
Commerce Commission to render a decision on the transaction
within 90 days of submission.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Delaware &amp; Hudson owns about 600 miles of track in New
York and Pennsylvania and has rights to run its trains on an
additional 900 miles of track.
   Mr. Dicello said Canadian Pacific's plans to rehabilitate
the line and increase freight traffic over it will increase
rail competition in the Northeast. Delaware &amp; Hudson provides

York and $5.5 million from Pennsylvania, Mr. Dicello said.

   Law -- Washington Docket:
   At Justice Department, New No. 2 Man
   Brings Humor, Humility to Difficult Job

   WASHINGTON -- Listening earnestly to questions about
several notoriously disorganized Justice Department
subdivisions, William Barr, the agency's new No. 2 man, nods,
sighs, and then breaks into a wide grin. "This is a big job]"
he declares.
   The post of deputy attorney general, traditionally the
day-to-day operations chief of the 75,000-person department,
now includes an additional task that is even more daunting.
He must help repair the damaged political reputation of his
boss, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, the most beleaguered
member of the Bush cabinet.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Barr, an affable Reaganite conservative with strong
ties to the Bush White House as well, has taken some sensible
preliminary steps. For starters, he reveals a sense of humor
and humility about a department that bucked and stalled while
a coterie of longtime Thornburgh vassals were at the wheel.
   "His personal staff was playing, by default, too much of
an operating role," acknowledges Mr. Barr, whose promotion
from assistant attorney general is expected to receive quick
Senate confirmation. Already moved into the deputy's spacious
fourth-floor office suite, the somewhat rumpled lawyer in
horn-rimmed glasses explains that he has taken the unusual
step of drafting three veteran U.S. attorneys as special
assistants. They will help him pick his way through a
bureaucratic briar patch that he admits he doesn't know much
about yet. The message to disgruntled department employees is
clear: We're going back to the drawing board, with respected
prosecutors from the field on the way to whip things into
shape.
   Mr. Barr, a former Central Intelligence Agency legislative
aide zealous about protecting executive branch prerogatives,
nevertheless promises "a more open department," with greater
access afforded to inquisitive lawmakers and reporters. He
won't comment on the matter directly, but he is said to
believe that the attorney general made a mistake by turning a
no-leaks policy into a holy crusade.
   Investigators collared no culprits, but Mr. Thornburgh
raised suspicions by locking out the department's
internal-affairs office. To make matters worse, the attorney
general kept quiet when two aides, since pushed aside,
registered some deception during lie-detector tests.
   Despite Mr. Barr's promises of reform, there are reasons
to be skeptical that he will bring lasting changes. Here are
three areas to watch:
                                                                                                       

   Public image. Mr. Thornburgh has been badly tarnished by
his bedraggled inquiry into a leak about a federal
investigation involving Rep. William Gray (D., Pa.). After
exonerating Mr. Gray a year ago, the attorney general now
refuses to reiterate that the No. 3 House Democrat isn't the
target of a grand jury inquiry in Philadelphia. That
obfuscation, combined with the issuance of subpoenas to
organizations that have paid Mr. Gray speaking fees, creates
the impression, once again, of partisan gamesmanship.
   Mr. Barr could help clear the air by urging the attorney
general to acknowledge that this is an exceptional case and
to state what, if anything, federal investigators still want
to know about Mr. Gray. But there is little reason to hope
this will happen. Asked about the Gray situation, Mr. Barr
says, "I don't know anything about any investigation, nor do
I want to." He declines to comment further.
                                                                                                       

   Congressional relations. After successfully helping
negotiate anti-drug legislation in late 1988, the Thornburgh
regime has taken an adversarial stance toward Congress,
compared by Democratic Capitol Hill staff members to that of
Reagan administration Attorney General Edwin Meese. Lately,
there have been positive developments, such as Mr.
Thornburgh's agreement to cooperate with a House Judiciary
Committee investigation of a longfestering computer software
procurement scandal at the department.
   But one way Mr. Barr impressed the attorney general,
according to some observers, was by refusing to cooperate
with congressional efforts to look into legal opinions that
expanded the authority of U.S. agents and troops to do police
work abroad. Moreover, in most cases the department hasn't
played a significant role in shaping legislation viewed as
important by the White House. The department isn't deeply
involved, for example, in the negotiations over the big
anti-crime bill under debate in the Senate.
                                                                                                       

   Running trains on time. Dick Thornburgh enjoys being
called governor. He cites his eight years as chief executive
of Pennsylvania as a case study of frugal, commonsense
management.
   At the Justice Department, he has identified waste and
inefficiency in a number of areas, including the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and the Marshals Service. New
directors are in place, and some bureaucratic flow charts
have been rearranged. But substantive change has been slow,
if evident at all. Drug enforcement officials, for example,
worry that regional marshals who act as custodians of
forfeited assets frequently allow them to depreciate because
of a lack of financial acumen.
   Meanwhile, other problems continue unchecked. In the
department's money-granting and research arm, the Office of
Justice Programs, career employees say that federal money
intended to fertilize innovative state and local programs is
being channeled elsewhere. A House Government Operations
subcommittee investigation disclosed that almost half of one
$50 million grant program for states and cities actually
stayed in Washington, most of it at the Justice Department.
   Mr. Barr says his mission will be "coordinating the
department's efforts {which have been} lacking in a number of
areas." As to specifics, he understandably pleads ignorance,
having just unpacked his boxes and hung his photographs. But
if Mr. Thornburgh is to resuscitate his reputation as a savvy
manager, it will be Mr. Barr who wades into more than a few
messes and begins the cleanup.

   Boeing Expects Korean Airlines Order
   For 23 Jets Valued at Nearly $4 Billion

   Korean Airlines is expected to sign a contract today for
23 747-400 Boeing jumbo jets in a deal valued at almost $4
billion.
   The transaction would mark the third giant order for
Boeing Co. from Asia in the past few weeks, underscoring the
rapid growth in that market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Seattle-based Boeing, the world's leading commercial
airplane maker, has scheduled a news conference for 11 a.m.
in Washington, D.C., to mark the signing.
   In addition to the attendance of Boeing Chairman Frank
Shrontz and C.H. Cho, a senior executive vice president of
Korean Airlines, lawmakers also have been invited, a signal
that the South Koreans hope will show that they're continuing
to try and reduce the U.S.'s merchandise trade deficit with
their country. The deficit, according to Commerce Department
figures, stood at $6.3 billion at the end of 1989.
   Boeing declined to disclose what kinds of planes Korean
Airlines will purchase, but an official at the carrier said
it will make 12 firm orders for 747-400s, as well as 11
"re-confirmations" for the four-engine aircraft. A
re-confirmation gives Korean Airlines the right to cancel at
a future date, but it is considered more of a commitment than
taking out options. Deliveries are planned to begin in 1991.
   Sources close to the transaction cautioned that the
numbers could slightly change before the contract signing.
   The airline executive said Korean Airlines will pay about
$170 million each for the 747s, adjusted for inflation.
   The official said that Korean Airlines also considered
Airbus Industrie's A-330 planes, but he said the Boeing
aircraft "are particularly suited" for trans-Pacific and
European routes. Airbus's A-330s also won't be ready until
several years after the Boeing planes are available.
   It wasn't immediately clear which of the world's
jet-engine manufacturers -- General Electric Co., Rolls-Royce
PLC or United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit --
will power the planes. An engine order often lags an aircraft
order. Pratt &amp; Whitney, though, has been named the supplier
for nine other 747-400s bought in the past by Korean
Airlines.
   The Korean Airlines order -- which follows a $2 billion
deal with China's Civil Aviation Administration and a $3.1
billion booking for 747-400s for Japan Airlines -- could
boost Boeing's stock price.
   The stock hit a 52-week high last Monday at $87. It
slumped later in the week, closing Friday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at $82.50, off $1.375.
   Judith Comeau, aerospace analyst for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.,
attributed the fall to profit-taking, noting that a number of
other blue-chips have suffered a similar fate over the past
few days. But she believes there is plenty of upside
potential left in the stock. "It is much too early to sell
Boeing," she said.
   Ms. Comeau pointed out that the 747-400 is a particularly
hot commodity right now. She said she recently visited AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines unit, for instance, where officials
are struggling to find a leasing company or another source
that can provide six 747s. "They can't get them anywhere,"
she said, explaining that they'll "probably have to settle
for" smaller McDonnell Douglas MD-11 trijets.
   The demand for the 747 is particularly acute in the
Pacific Rim. Boeing's own forecast is that air traffic to
Asia from North America and Europe will soar 9% annually
through the next decade. Within Asia, air traffic is expected
to surge over the same period almost 8%, and within the U.S.
only 5.2%.

   Ames to Close One-Third of Its Stores
   And Reduce Its Work Force by 36%

BANKRUPTCIES (BCY)
BROADLINE RETAILERS, DEPARTMENT STORES (RTB)
</IN>
<LP>
   Ames Department Stores Inc., in a major retreat from its
ill-fated expansion plans, said it plans to close nearly
one-third of its 679 stores by summer's end and cut its work
force by about 18,000 employees, or 36%.
   The Rocky Hill, Conn.-based discount retailer, which has
been operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankrupty Code
since April, said it planned to submit a strategic plan that
includes the store closings to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
after clearing the plan with its creditors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stephen L. Pistner, a retailing consultant who was brought
in as chief executive of Ames after the bankruptcy filing,
said the massive downsizing would cut expenses and reduce
operating losses. In addition, inventory sales from the
stores targeted for closing are expected to generate about
$180 million in much-needed cash.
   Thomas Tashjian, a retail analyst with Seidler Amdec
Securities in Los Angeles, said the cash would help
significantly. "One of the key issues with dealing with Ames
is to buoy the confidence of vendors about the company's cash
flow and financial position. It will indicate that they're
going to have cash flowing in and more cash than vendors had
originally expected," he said.
   Ames filed for bankruptcy court protection after some
vendors had stopped shipping goods to its stores because Ames
couldn't pay for earlier shipments.
   The planned closing of 221 stores, located mainly in
Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, will
eventually result in 18,000 layoffs. After the closings, Ames
will have 458 stores in 17 states, primarily in the
Northeast, and about 32,000 employees, the company said. The
store closings are set for August and September.
   Ames estimated that the stores targeted for closing had an
operating loss of $47.5 million for the fiscal year ended
Jan. 27. The company reported a net loss of $228 million for
the year. That loss included a restructuring charge of $137
million for 74 stores and an extraordinary write-off of $8
million for fees related to prepayment of debt.
   Ames said reserves for the additional store closings will
be reflected in its first-quarter results, but declined to
provide an estimate.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Ames
closed at $2.375, unchanged.
   Mr. Pistner said any additional store closings would have
to be studied on a case-by-case basis. "We really aren't
concentrating on that now. This is a very important and very
big move. Any other store closings would have to be studied
on an individual basis," he said.
   Ames's troubles largely reflect problems at the Zayre
stores it acquired in 1988. Ames paid $800 million for more
than 300 Zayre stores, with hopes of turning the chain around
by shedding its heavy discounting practice and switching to
an "everyday low price" pitch. Ames renamed and spruced up
the Zayre stores but had little success attracting new
customers, due in part to a sagging economy in the Northeast.
   Of the 221 stores to be closed, 37 are Ames stores and 184
are former Zayre stores.
   Mr. Tashjian described the move as "very quick, deep and
decisive action." He said, "The fastest way to start to make
headway in this situation is to cut off some of the dead
wood, the marginal stores, and clearly that is what Mr.
Pistner has started." He said Ames must also improve cash
flow and regain some of the customers that used to shop in
the original Ames stores.
   Mr. Pistner said the plan is a "critical first step
towards our primary goal of leading Ames out of Chapter 11.
This downsizing will cut our expenses, reduce operating
losses, and allow us to focus our efforts on serving
customers."
   The Ames plan also calls for it to close distribution
facilities in Plant City, Fla., and Worcester, Mass. Upon
approval from the bankruptcy court, Ames said it will
complete construction of a distribution center in Leesport,
Pa., in early 1991.

   Do Japanese Have
   Wrong Impression
   About van Gogh?

   Picture Sold for $82.5 Million,
   While the Art of Japan
   Inspires an Ennui There

   TOKYO -- Vincent van Gogh, a century ago, was obsessed
with Japan. He used Japanese motifs. He even gave himself
Japanese eyes in self-portraits.
   Today, Japan is obsessed with van Gogh. As the world
knows, his "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" is about to land on these
shores, purchased by a Japanese paper-company tycoon for a
record $82.5 million. Van Gogh's "Sunflowers" already hangs
in the skyscraper headquarters of a Tokyo insurance company,
which bought it in 1987 for $39.9 million -- a lot of money
at the time.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hardly a painting by the Dutch master goes to auction that
Japanese collectors don't try to lay their hands on, at any
price. Japanese buyers have a similarly fevered interest in
nearly all the big names in Western art, particularly late
19th-century French impressionists.
   Compare the spending frenzy with the measured interest and
the relatively modest sums Japanese buyers are willing to put
out for the best of Japanese art. At a major auction of
Japanese pieces held at Christie's in New York about two
months ago, the top price paid for a matched pair of
17th-century painted screens, a classic art form, was $1.76
million. That isn't peanuts, and Japanese buyers were the
most enthusiastic bidders, but the action was hardly in van
Gogh's league.
   Japanese, with their penchant for things Western, have the
money to buy what they want, be it Levi's jeans, Rockefeller
Center or a Renoir masterpiece. With art, there is also
opportunity to buy into Western values.
   Yuko Kikuchi, a spokeswoman for C Two-Network Co., a Tokyo
food purveyor, says, "Companies want to promote concepts like
freedom." Western art somehow seems to encourage such
purposes.
   "For the Japanese, something Western has always been
associated with aspirations," says Kazuko Shiomi, president
of Sotheby's Japan Ltd. "We looked to the West to get
enlightened. It shows you are broad-minded. Japanese art is
nice, but it doesn't do the same thing."
   Western art has snob appeal. And that, too, matters in the
land of the "nouveaux tres riches". Sotheby's exploits the
phenomenon by inviting wealthy Japanese to sit in its private
balcony at New York auctions, where elegant patrons bid up
the most expensive stuff.
   Picassos, Chagalls, Renoirs, van Goghs and Monets go for
the highest sums, dealers say, because they are names
Japanese buyers learned in school. (Western buyers are
similarly impressionable, one dealer suggests.)
   Issei Fujiwara, a hustling, shaggy-haired iconoclast, has
lately been trying to broaden collectors' tastes by making
contemporary American art more desirable to the Japanese. In
1987, he and Ikkan Sanada, a young art consultant in New
York, took the owners of 15 companies on an art tour of the
U.S., introducing them to contemporary pieces and trying to
interest them in spending money.
   After the trip, real-estate developer Murimasa Okawa paid
$2.5 million for a Willem de Kooning painting. Since then, he
has spent millions more. His sunny, multistory home in the
heart of Tokyo's Shibuya district is accented with bright
works by Roy Lichtenstein, Hans Hofmann and Sam Francis.
   "I could feel the energy and power that contemporary art
had," the 49-year-old Mr. Okawa says. "Impressionist art does
not have that. And Japanese art is like eggplants that are
cut and spread on the table. Not fresh."
   Contemporary Japanese art, on the other hand, is so hard
to sell that most popular galleries don't show it, thus
forcing artists to rent their own space. "Critics always say
Japanese art has a long way to go to catch up with Western
standards," Ikuo Hirayama, the dean of a Tokyo art school,
recently told a magazine.
   The major buyers of traditional Japanese art exhibit pride
in their heritage, not just love of art. Tea-ceremony
utensils, screens and scroll-paintings all have a following.
Art from feudal Japan is collected, especially by museums.
   Indeed, Japanese buyers today also are pushing prices of
Japanese art higher, but it is a "completely different
market," says Michael Dunn, a private dealer in Tokyo. Adds
Hiroyuki Satoh, who works at Kobayashi Gallery Co., the Ginza
gallery that bought "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" at auction for
Ryoei Saito, the paper mogul: "The method of expression in
Japanese and Western art is quite different, and so is the
market."
   Even the oddly reversed roles of Messrs. Dunn and Satoh
suggest the state of the art market: The Englishman, Mr.
Dunn, is a major dealer in Japanese art, while the Japanese,
Mr. Satoh, specializes in Western pieces.
   Big Japanese companies, including Bridgestone Corp. and
Sanyo Securities Co., decorate their buildings and
company-sponsored museums with Picassos, Chagalls and
Renoirs. The brewer Suntory Ltd. recently spent $10 million
on 3,800 posters by the English artist Phillip Granville --
this after mainly collecting Japanese glasswork and pottery
for 30 years. But stop in at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd., or
Deutsche Bank AG's Tokyo office, or even the U.S. Embassy,
and you will see a profusion of Japanese antiques or works of
modern, often obscure, Japanese artists. To each his own.
   The Western fascination with Japanese art began with
19th-century artists, not only van Gogh but Claude Monet.
Both studied Japanese prints and found inspiration for their
own works in Japanese style. They employed similar colors and
compositions -- and gave their subjects a Japanese look.
   Some art scholars conjecture that the affinity
impressionists had with Japan is what makes Japanese
collectors partial to the impressionists. (Oddly, the prints
the impressionists loved -- "ukiyo-e", or paintings of the
pleasure districts of old Japan -- weren't considered art at
the time by the upper class. Now, however, rich Japanese are
clamoring for paintings inspired by what their ancestors
repudiated.)
   Masahiro Takano, the owner of a Tokyo taxi company, has
the world's largest collection of paintings by the French
artist Marie Laurencin, a contemporary of Picasso's whose
simple pastels remind him of Japanese prints. Perhaps, he
says, that's because "she used Japanese as models."
   If the bottom ever drops out of the market for
impressionists, some think, Japanese might begin to lavish
huge sums on things familiar. There are historical precedents
for that. When Japan was isolated from the world in the early
17th century, lords would sometimes swap big tracts of land
for a single, rare tea-ceremony bowl. Come to think of it,
that isn't so different from dropping $82 million and change
on an old van Gogh.

   WASHINGTON -- Savings-and-loan bailout officials are
racing to fashion a new policy to sell off real estate in
blocks so big they'd make Donald Trump a piker by comparison.
   The idea -- which has tremendous political momentum --
could put scores of $500 million packages of real estate on
the market over the next few years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Burdened with a stockpile of properties that will grow by
tens of billions of dollars this quarter alone, officials
overseeing the thrift-industry bailout hope so-called bulk
sales will speed the real estate into the private sector,
where the properties can be managed more efficiently.
Political concerns are at work as well. Congress has been
lambasting the bailout agencies for moving too slowly, and
the bailout's drain on the federal budget has prompted
increased pressure from the Bush administration to raise cash
by selling the properties seized from insolvent thrifts.
   "If it works," said an enthusiastic William Seidman,
chairman of both the Resolution Trust Corp. and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., "we'll be selling the stuff in
half-billion-dollar chunks." In many cases, the government
would provide most of the financing and take a share of the
profits if the properties do well.
   But some outside the RTC say bulk sales are a disastrous
idea that could increase the already astonishing cost to
taxpayers by slashing the government's long-term return from
the properties. The real estate would have to be sold at huge
discounts, critics say, because the pool of buyers for $500
million chunks would be so small.
   Bulk sales "are a bad idea that should be nipped in the
bud," said William Isaac, Mr. Seidman's predecessor as FDIC
chairman, now head of a bank consulting firm, Secura Group.
"The process should be as competitive as possible. This will
just give the mega-investor a sweetheart deal."
   Even supporters of the sales argue the risks for the
government are big. For instance, buyers wary of bad assets
may demand provisions -- known as asset puts -- to return
their merchandise to the government for a year. "If you're
selling with lots of unknowns, there's going to be a low
purchase price. And then if buyers can put back the worst
assets, the government may have wound up selling the best
assets at a very low price," said John Aldridge, an Atlanta
attorney who specializes in straightening out bad real estate
loans.
   Another concern is that "the price of this action may be a
heavy effect on real estate values," said Norman Katz, a bank
consultant with Grant Thornton. But many officials now
believe the uncertainty created by the RTC's surplus of real
estate is creating a bigger problem in the markets than quick
sales would.
   Not all of the RTC's inventory will be sold in bulk. Good
assets such as profitable hotels or other commercial property
will probably be sold individually -- many at a televised
auction this fall -- in order to draw many bidders. "By
blending strategies we can maximize the return," said Diane
Casey, spokeswoman for the RTC Oversight Board, which sets
policy for the RTC.
   But fear of the alternative to bulk sales -- letting
bureaucrats manage and sell all the assets one by one -- is
driving the policy, which will be considered by the RTC's
board in the next few weeks. Said Mr. Seidman: "We know the
longer the government holds these assets, the more the value
tends to decrease."
   Also driving the policy is the reluctance of buyers of the
RTC's broke thrifts to take on their loans and other assets.
In all but a handful of the 150 thrifts the RTC has sold or
liquidated, buyers have wanted only deposits, branches and a
few easily sold assets such as securities.
   Thus the RTC's rotten and not-so-rotten real estate empire
grows bigger and bigger. At the end of March, the RTC held
$7.7 billion in real estate. By the end of this month -- if
the RTC completes its ambitious plan to sell 141 thrifts in
the quarter -- the total is likely to be $40 billion.
   Bulk sale blocks might include healthy home loans, ailing
commercial real estate loans, or a mix of elements, said
Joseph Robert, president of J.E. Robert Co., a real estate
management firm. Mr. Robert, who has been consulting with the
RTC on the design of the deals, described a hypothetical sale
of a block of assets with an estimated value of $500 million.
   The buyer would make a 15% down payment and demand, say, a
20% discount for buying in bulk -- bringing the price to $400
million. Once properties were sold, the buyer would receive
all proceeds to as much as $400 million. Above that level,
the government would take 70% of the proceeds, and the buyer
would get 30%. Above $500 million -- the original estimated
value -- the positions might switch, with the buyer receiving
70%. "It creates an enormous incentive for all parties to
maximize the return," Mr. Robert said.
   Firms like Mr. Robert's would manage and prepare the
properties to be sold. Likely investors might include large
institutions such as pension funds or insurance companies.
Interests in the pools of properties also could be sold as
securities.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Federal Judge to Weigh Whether RTC
   Can Override State Laws in Thrift Sales
   ----

   A federal judge in Santa Fe, N.M., will be asked this week
to decide whether the Resolution Trust Corp. has the power to
override state laws in the sale of failed thrifts to banks.
   On Friday, the sale of a New Mexico thrift was delayed to
allow the court to decide whether the RTC can sell the thrift
and its out-of-county branches to an Albuquerque bank that,
under state law, must keep its branches within the county of
its main office.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The issue affects thrift sales in as many as 13 states
where laws restrict, to varying degrees, the ability of banks
to establish branches. Bank commissioners in three of those
states -- Colorado, Arkansas and New Mexico -- have gone to
court to block thrift sales by the RTC, arguing that the
federal agency is running roughshod over states' rights to
enforce their own laws.
   "This will definitely have a national impact," said a
spokesman for the RTC. "From the standpoint of some
acquirors, this is a real cloud."
   The RTC argues that it has the power, under the
legislation that created the agency, to override some state
laws in order to accomplish its job of selling failed savings
and loan associations in the quickest and most cost-effective
way possible. To strengthen its argument, the RTC on June 1
adopted a policy explicitly stating that it can override
state laws.
   The restrictions on bank branches have become a critical
testing ground for that policy because banks have emerged as
the strongest bidders for RTC-controlled thrifts. Few thrifts
have the capital to bid for ailing institutions, although the
thrifts are exempt from branching restrictions in most
states.
   State bank commissioners, who are backed in their fight by
at least two national trade groups, say the standoff can be
resolved by compromise. Illinois, for example, eased its
restrictions last November, permitting banks, who are
restricted from branching, to acquire troubled thrifts that
have branches.
   In states where similar changes aren't contemplated, the
state commissioners suggest that the RTC could sell offending
branches separately -- a move that could slow the sales of
thrifts -- or require the buyer to establish the branches as
separately capitalized banks.
   The latter alternative was used in Colorado this past
January after the state convinced a federal judge in Denver
to grant a restraining order blocking the sale of two thrifts
in Grand Junction to Denver-based Mesa National Bank. In the
face of the order, the bank agreed to establish separate
banks in lieu of branches.
   But in nine similar situations still to be resolved,
Colorado officials aren't betting that many banks will be
willing to accept such a costly compromise. Barbara Walker,
first assistant attorney general in Colorado, said she will
be back in court next week, filing a request that the Denver
judge review the newly adopted RTC policy and rule on its
legality.
   But the first such review will be in New Mexico, with
arguments scheduled for Thursday before U.S. District Judge
Santiago Campos in Santa Fe. The hearing was scheduled after
New Mexico's director of financial institutions, Kenneth J.
Carson Jr., sought a restraining order on Friday to block the
sale of New Mexico Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, which
has $197.4 million in assets, to First National Bank in
Albuquerque.
   The RTC agreed to postpone the sale, pending Judge
Campos's review. Norman Corzine, president and chief
executive officer of First National Bank, said the bank's bid
for the thrift was submitted "on the assumption of a
branch-banking override."
   Now, he says, "we're just observers on the sidelines."
   Meanwhile, First National Bank on Friday did acquire First
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Albuquerque, a $151.5
million thrift with three branches in Albuquerque and one in
Santa Fe. To avoid violating state laws with the Santa Fe
branch, Mr. Corzine said, an affiliate bank, FirstBank Santa
Fe, acquired the branch and its deposits.

   EINDHOVEN, The Netherlands -- N.V. Philips
Gloeilampenfabriek said that its Hamburg medical systems
subsidiary has formed a joint venture with two Soviet
partners to install and service Philips medical equipment in
the Soviet Union.
   Philips will work with the Moscow-based Republican
Children's Clinical Hospital and the Research and Technical
Services Cooperative Tomotek to repair and service equipment
on the spot.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Prior to the formation of the joint venture, parts and
service technicians were flown to Moscow to repair the
medical machinery. Philips noted that the former approach
resulted in unacceptable delays in repairing equipment.
   Of the three partners, Philips will hold the lion's share
of the venture with a 55% stake; the children's hospital will
hold a 30% share, with the remaining interest in the hands of
Tomotek.

   Borland Uses Low Prices, Direct Sales
   To Woo Lotus Spreadsheet Customers

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)

</IN>
<LP>
   Borland International Inc. is seeking to loosen Lotus
Development Corp.'s grip on the spreadsheet market with an
unusual combination of low prices and direct sales.
   Borland, a Scotts Valley, Calif., software company best
known for its programming language, utility and database
products, has sought to woo Lotus customers with a
spreadsheet that can swap information with 1-2-3 files and
can work on older personal computers or less expensive models
outfitted with only bare-bones internal memory. Borland sells
its spreadsheet, called Quattro Pro, for an eye-catching $99
to owners of 1-2-3.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The strategy is that we're competing with Lotus
upgrades," which typically sell for less than $150 to owners
of an earlier version of 1-2-3, said Phillipe Kahn, Borland's
chief executive officer.
   Since introducing the new spreadsheet last fall, Borland
has sold more than 200,000 copies. And while its share of the
market remains puny compared with Lotus's stake, Borland is
steadily taking away some sales from its larger rival.
   Two months ago, for instance, Laventhol &amp; Horwath, a
Philadelphia-based accounting firm, purchased 750 copies of
Quattro Pro instead of newer versions of 1-2-3. The company
plans to purchase another 1,000 copies in the next year
because Borland's spreadsheet "enables us to extend the
useful life of our existing hardware," said Alan Urkowitz,
associate director of professional productivity.
   Customers say Borland isn't winning sales on price alone:
its spreadsheet works with the MS-DOS standard but makes
nifty use of graphics and allows data from different
spreadsheet files to be "linked," or exchanged.
   "We still have some {1-2-3} die-hards, but for the most
they've fallen in love with Quattro Pro," said Steven Sheere,
controller at Kwikset, a subsidiary of Black &amp; Decker in
Anaheim, Calif.
   A new study of corporate software buyers lends further
support to the idea that Borland is indeed winning converts
from among 1-2-3 customers. The study, by Emeryville, Calif.,
researcher Techtel Corp., reports that Borland's Quattro Pro
spreadsheet, released last fall, is being purchased by as
many companies as Lotus's 1-2-3 version 2.2, which is the
company's biggest seller.
   Though 1-2-3 outsells Quattro Pro by a wide margin,
Borland "has made a significant breakthrough," said Michael
Kelly, Techtel's president. "No other spreadsheet has matched
the purchase penetration of 1-2-3 in the five years we've
been measuring the market."
   The surge in spreadsheet sales is expected to boost
Borland's results. Peter Rogers, an analyst at Robertson
Stephens &amp; Co., estimates Borland will earn 26 cents a share
in its first fiscal quarter ending June 30, twice its
year-ago per-share earnings. Mr. Rogers expects Borland's
revenue to total $36 million for the quarter compared with
$23 million in the year-ago period.
   Lotus, however, insists Borland doesn't have staying power
in spreadsheets.
   "I think Quattro Pro is a decent product and they're
making a decent amount of noise," said Frank Ingari, chief of
Lotus's spreadsheet division. "The question long-term is
whether they can sustain the business at a $99 price. It's a
very expensive way to enter the market."
   Mr. Ingari vows to turn up the heat on Borland in the
third quarter of this year with an upgrade to 1-2-3 "that's
going to be a deadly product" for Borland.
   Some analysts are skeptical, arguing that Lotus has spent
too much time trying to "port," or adapt its spreadsheet to
many different types of computers. In the process, Lotus has
failed to add some new features to 1-2-3 that competitors
offer, especially in the area of graphics and better use of a
computer's expensive internal memory.
   Borland's Mr. Kahn insists that Lotus will find it hard to
match some of the novel technical features in Quattro Pro
that make it suitable for less expensive personal computers
that are tied into knots by some more complex versions of
1-2-3. He also said Borland turns a profit on Quattro Pro,
whose cost-of-goods per unit is $10, in part because it sells
most copies directly to customers, bypassing software
distributors.
   While Borland is making gains, it is mainly among
medium-size and small businesses, not the Fortune 1000
concerns that comprise the bulk of Lotus's revenues. "My
sense is that Lotus's corporate accounts are as rock-solid as
ever," said Jeffrey Tartar, editor of Softletter, an industry
newsletter.

   Foreign Exchange:
   Australian Dollar Has Lots of Spring
   Due to High Rates; Outlook Is Bullish

   NEW YORK -- The Australian dollar has been springier than
a kangaroo's hop recently because of Australia's high
interest rates, and currency specialists forecast continued
strength in the near term.
   With rates holding firm, the mood about the currency is
bullish even though further Reserve Bank of Australia
intervention is expected and worries about slower Australian
economic growth persist.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The day-to-day tone looks firm for now," says Trevor
Woodland, corporate sales manager at Harris Trust &amp; Savings
Bank in Chicago. "I think the rise is almost entirely driven
by high interest rates and expectations that they are going
to stay that way."
   Late Friday here, the Australian dollar traded at 77.18
U.S. cents, off from 77.70 cents late Thursday, but
substantially higher than levels around 75 cents in early
February.
   Impressed with Australia's interest rates, some traders
predict the Australian dollar will work its way toward 80
cents in the next few weeks.
   Australia's interest rates are among the most attractive
of major industrial nations even though the Reserve Bank of
Australia eased its monetary policy several times earlier
this year after remaining restrictive for almost two years.
   Three-month Euro Australian dollar deposits currently
yield more than 15%, roughly eight percentage points more
than three-month Euroyen deposits and seven percentage points
more than three-month Eurodollar and Euro West German mark
deposits.
   High interest rates are often helpful for a currency,
partly because they make yields attractive in the
Eurocurrency market.
   Responding to signs of softness in the economy, the
Australian central bank loosened credit several times before
the nation's general elections were held March 24. The
Australian dollar slid in response to those moves, but it
stabilized once traders perceived rates weren't going to fall
very far.
   Australia's treasurer, Paul Keating, has said that
"excessive easing" must be avoided to prevent an upturn in
demand and cost pressures. The inflation rate has run close
to 8% in recent years.
   "There's no reason for {the Australian dollar} to go down"
as long as interest rates remain high, says Martin May, a
trader of Australian government bonds at National Australia
Bank Ltd. in New York.
   But further Australian dollar gains may be a rocky ride,
traders warn. The Reserve Bank of Australia, which worked
hard to support the dollar only a few months ago, is now
trying to curb its strength.
   Friday's decline was caused by profit-taking that occurred
after the central bank was spotted intervening during Sydney
dealings, traders say.
   A very strong Australian dollar can hurt Australia's trade
performance by making the nation's exports too costly for
foreigners and increasing the domestic appetite for imports.
The Reserve Bank is expected to fight hard to keep the
Australian dollar down and prevent a worsening of the trade
picture.
   Australia had an unadjusted current account deficit of
1.02 billion Australian dollars in April, narrower than
A$2.04 billion (US$1.57 billion) in March.
   There's "good ground for concern" that exports will be
pinched if the Australian dollar keeps rising, says Rick
Porter, manager of corporate trading at Westpac Banking Corp.
in New York.
   Australia is an exporter of many products, including beef,
wheat, metal ores, wool and coal. More than half of its
arable land is used for agriculture.
   This year's generally firmer commodity prices are seen
supportive of the Australian dollar, even though gold is
trading at its lowest levels in four years, currency analysts
say.
   Against its trade-weighted index, the Australian dollar is
hovering near 61.0 after moving out of an expected range of
58.0 to 60.0, and this certainly makes competitiveness an
issue for the central bank, says Mr. Porter.
   The trade-weighted index measures the Australian dollar's
value against a basket of 24 currencies; the weights have
been set by the Reserve Bank of Australia.
   Intervention isn't expected to spoil the Australian
dollar's rise right now, not with high rates working in its
favor.
   Because a number of recent economic reports have showed
unexpected strength, more Reserve Bank easing isn't seen
likely for a while. Australia's gross domestic product rose a
larger-than-expected 1.8% in the first quarter. Last month,
the number of employed workers rose to 7,903,100 from
7,861,000 in April, more than economists had expected.
   But the scenario may change soon and possibly injure the
Australian dollar. Analysts say high rates may suppress
growth in a number of sectors in the second half of the year,
likely causing a resurfacing of easing fears.
   Treasurer Keating said last week that lower rates of
spending, production and employment are likely as the economy
makes the transition to lower spending and lower inflation
after rapid growth and spending in the past.
   The Australian dollar may fall to 70 U.S. cents or lower
by year end if it is plagued by easing worries, says Mr.
Woodland of Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank.
   As for the U.S. dollar, continued range trading is
expected as traders await fresh news about the U.S. economy,
the move toward German monetary union and the Soviet Union's
political turmoil.
   Late Friday in New York, the dollar traded at 1.6975 marks
and 153.49 yen, up from 1.6935 marks and 152.55 yen late
Thursday.
   In Tokyo Monday, the dollar was trading at 153.45 yen soon
after opening at 153.35 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was
trading at about 1.6985 marks, up a bit from Friday's Tokyo
close of 1.6938 marks.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $355.70 an ounce, up $1.10.
Estimated volume was a moderate 2.8 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $354.45 an ounce.

   NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp. issued 9.6 million of its
common shares to its bank lenders to cover terms of its
December 1987 financial restructuring program.
   Under that plan, which retired $227 million in bank debt,
Western Union agreed to issue additional common to its 31
banks if its stock price fell below $2.05625 at Dec. 31,
1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Western Union shares closed unchanged at 50 cents.
   The arrangement with the banks is similar to one that
Western Union had with ITT Corp. Last month, Western Union
issued an additional 7.8 million, or 9.02%, of its common
shares to ITT under terms of its December 1987 agreement to
buy ITT World Communications Inc. The agreement with ITT also
carried the same $2.05625 trigger.
   The new issue gave ITT 16.58% of Western Union's common,
making it the second-largest owner next to New York financier
Bennett S. LeBow, who owns 43.4%. By contrast, the block held
by the banks is widely dispersed and difficult to count,
according to a Western Union spokesman, who added that he
wasn't sure how much of the company's stock banks currently
hold.
   Western Union plans to distribute the additional stock
from a pool of 17.39 million new common shares that it
registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
Friday.
   The company spokesman said ITT will receive 7.8 million of
the registered shares since it had originally taken its new
stock in the form of so-called legend shares, which guarantee
ownership but cannot be traded. Those 7.8 million legend
shares now will convert to registered shares, he said.
   Meanwhile, Western Union, which has been struggling to
avoid a filing under bankruptcy laws, faces a big hurdle this
Friday when it must pay $51 million of interest on its senior
notes. Western Union has said it may be forced to default on
the payment if it can't find sufficient funds to cover it.
Annual interest payments at the company total $116 million.
   To ease its debt burden, Western Union has proposed a
plan, now awaiting SEC clearance, that would give new debt
securities to its bondholders and reclassify its preferred
stock into new common shares in exchange for more favorable
terms on the $530 million debt from its notes.
   The spokesman said so far there has been no progress on
the exchange offer either from the SEC or bondholders.

   OAK BROOK, Ill. -- McDonald's Corp., apparently feeling
the heat of critics who contend that customers often forsake
nutrition for speed in fast food, will begin posting charts
with ingredients information.
   The 3-by-3-foot posters will summarize nutritional data
that have been available in 56-page booklets in the company's
restaurants for more than two years. Food tray liners also
will display appropriate menu information by the time of day;
for example, the contents of the breakfast-time Egg McMuffin
will be on tray liners used in the mornings, while that of
the Big Mac burger will appear later in the day.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "A lot of special-interest groups are anxious for us to
tell all. We've been trying, but they never seem to be
satisfied," Edward Rensi, president of McDonald's USA, said
in an interview. "So we thought we'd take an extra step and
put the information on {posters} so they can walk up and read
it" on a wall.
   "We're very proud of our food and spend a lot of time and
effort making sure it's as nutritious as it can be," Mr.
Rensi added, suggesting that competitor fast-food chains, and
even four-star restaurants, follow suit so customers know
what they're ordering.
   Mr. Rensi denied that McDonald's, the world's largest
restaurant company, was reacting to recent harsh criticism of
its menu. In April, a Nebraska
businessman-turned-cholesterol-fighter, Phil Sokolof,
lambasted the chain in full-page newspaper ads for
contributing to what he termed "the poisoning of America."
Mr. Sokolof was particularly critical of the cholesterol and
fat content of the food at McDonald's and other unidentified
fast-food chains.
   McDonald's attacked the ad as "reckless and misleading,"
but perhaps coincidently said the company was reformulating
its milk shakes to go to a lower-fat content, and was phasing
out the use of beef tallow, which is high in saturated fat,
in cooking french fries.
   The nutrition posters will begin appearing next month,
although some McDonald's stores have displayed content
analysis alongside their menus for months.
   "We think we've got a damn good nutrition story to tell,"
Mr. Rensi said, contending that if patrons began comparing
the content of McDonald's menu with that of competitors, it
would "ultimately help our sales -- unless they change their
menus."
   Quoting what he said is a nutritionist, Mr. Rensi said,
"`There are no junk foods, there are only junk diets.' Our
position is, everything in moderation. You ought to have a
balanced diet. You ought to eat cherries, pears, beans, Big
Macs, milk, bread. . . ."
   Although his company is going to put up wall posters, Mr.
Rensi said restaurant help is seldom asked nutrition
questions or about menu ingredients. "The people who are
really interested in this already have the information," he
said.

   CBS in Talks
   To Make Shows
   For Discovery

   NEW YORK -- CBS, the only major broadcast network without
a presence in cable television, is negotiating with Discovery
Channel to produce original programming for the cable
channel.
   If an agreement can be reached, the shows would be
produced by CBS News, a unit of CBS Inc. It hasn't been
determined whether CBS would receive payment for the shows,
or whether the No. 3-rated network would ask for a stake in
Discovery Channel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman for CBS News said it was "too premature" to
comment on the discussions. Greg Moyer, senior vice president
of Discovery Channel's programming group, said: "The world is
filled with interesting speculation. I can't comment on
that."
   But John Sie, senior vice president of Tele-Communications
Inc., a part-owner of Discovery Channel, said: "We have
discussed projects with each network. There is a possibility
of an equity stake in Discovery, if the project is big
enough. But nothing we've talked about so far is that major."
   The talks come as cable channels are looking for more
original programming. Discovery Channel, for instance, also
has held talks with Public Affairs Television Inc., owned by
commentator and essayist Bill Moyers, for a series. A
spokeswoman for Mr. Moyers's company confirmed that
negotiations were held and would continue.
   ABC News is negotiating with Discovery Channel to
broadcast a co-production venture with Peter Kuhnhardt
Productions for Discovery Channel tentatively titled "Moments
in Crisis."
   According to an individual familiar with the CBS talks,
CBS News, which produces "60 Minutes," "48 Hours" and "Face
to Face With Connie Chung" for the network, is exploring
other "paths of distribution" for additional shows, and is
interested in Discovery Channel, which programs 18 hours a
day and has about 50 million subscribers. The official said
talks have been held irregularly for the past 18 months and
that discussions will continue.
   The official said Laurence A. Tisch, CBS Inc.'s president,
hasn't cleared any cable venture. Mr. Tisch has repeatedly
told CBS affiliates and stockholders that the broadcasting
company would concentrate on its core business, over-the-air
network television, and not cable.
   CBS remains the only broadcaster without cable ventures.
Capital Cities/ABC Inc. is a partial owner of two cable
outlets, Arts &amp; Entertainment and the all-sports ESPN.
National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co.,
has several ventures, including NBC Cable and a separate
channel titled Consumer News and Business Channel, or CNBC.
   CBS had a loss of $30 million in 1982 with its own tony
advertiser-supported cable channel, CBS Cable, which
specialized in cultural programming. It folded after only 14
months because of lack of advertiser support.
   Discovery Channel, launched in June 1985, is owned by a
group of cable operators: Tele-Communications, United Cable
Television Corp., Cox Communications Inc. and Newhouse
Broadcasting Corp. Its founder and chairman, John Hendricks,
is a partial owner. The channel specializes in nonfiction
shows such as "Mother Nature," "Profiles of Nature" and
"Beyond 2000."
   Discovery Channel's Mr. Moyer said it plans to have
original shows account for 15% of the schedule. "Fifty
percent is acquired from other programmers" unedited, he
said, "and 35% is repackaged under the Discovery umbrella."
   It isn't unusual for a broadcast network news division to
produce shows for cable. ABC News supplies A&amp;E with two
series, "The Eagle and the Bear" and "Heroes." "It adds to
our bottom line," said Irwin Winer, senior vice president of
finance for ABC News.
   In addition, ABC News is to produce six episodes of a new
show on the history of blacks in America for A&amp;E. The series,
"In Search of the Dream," will air in October.
   "Original shows help a cable channel establish an identity
instantly," said Brooke Bailey Johnson, A&amp;E's vice president,
programming and production. "It's terribly important for us
to do as much original programming as possible."
   A&amp;E will air a weekly one-hour series on the record
industry, "Inside Track," with musician Graham Nash, on
Sundays beginning in the fall. The cable channel recently
began broadcasting a weekly one-hour show, "Arts &amp;
Entertainment Revue," produced by King World Productions Inc.
   CBS's discussions with Discovery Channel follow an
agreement between the broadcast giant and Turner Broadcasting
System Inc.'s Cable News Network to work from the same bureau
in Berlin. Personnel isn't being shared. Other shared bureaus
might follow.

   PARIS -- New York law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp;
Flom announced plans for an association with Bredin, Prat,
Saint-Esteben, Grandjean &amp; Morabia, a corporate-law
specialist here.
   The two law firms said they don't plan to merge. But
because they don't have offices in each other's home cities,
they will refer business to each other and cooperate closely.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bredin Prat of Paris also said that as soon as statutory
changes here permit -- probably in September of 1991 -- it
will merge with a new U.S.-led group of lawyers in Paris,
creating one of this city's first Franco-American firms.
   The U.S. lawyers, formerly with the Paris office of the
U.S. firm Coudert Brothers, will begin using Bredin Prat's
offices and working closely with the French firm as of July
1. Until the merger, they will remain a legally separate
entity, to be called Schepard, Baxter &amp; Associes.
   Two months ago, two other Paris-based firms, one U.S.-led
and the other French, announced merger plans, creating what
would be one of Paris's largest firms. S.G. Archibald, one of
the country's oldest non-French firms, and Courtois Bouloy
Lebel &amp; Associes, a large French firm, said they will merge
once the law permits. They too will work closely together
while they wait.

   IRVINE, Calif. -- Taco Bell Corp. said it recalled 300,000
plastic sports water bottles sold last week as part of a
nationwide promotion, because it discovered that a mouthpiece
part could be swallowed by children.
   Taco Bell, a Mexican-style fast-food chain, said no
injuries were related to the water bottle. But the company, a
unit of PepsiCo Inc., Purchase, N.Y., said it decided to stop
selling the bottles when a customer reported that his
21-month-old child had dismantled one of the bottles and
tried to swallow the mouthpiece. Last Friday, Taco Bell said
it had learned that two other children had done the same
thing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Taco Bell last Monday began selling the water bottles for
99 cents each with a food purchase. Initial plans called for
the sale of about 2.5 million of the bottles, which were part
of a $12 million "Tacos to Go" advertising campaign.
   The recall is voluntary and is being coordinated through
the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Taco Bell said.
Commission officials couldn't be reached to comment. The
bottle's manufacturer, Specialized Bicycle Components of
Morgan Hill, Calif., said it halted production of the
bottles, which it has made for 10 years, while it discusses
the matter with the safety commission.
   Taco Bell said people can return the bottles for refunds.
A spokesman said the company hadn't determined the cost of
the recall.

   NEW YORK -- Help-wanted advertising continued its sluggish
pace in April, and remained sharply lower than the
year-earlier level.
   The Conference Board said its help-wanted advertising
index fell to 138 in April, down from 139 in March and 21
points below April 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The index, a seasonally adjusted indicator of hiring
plans, has remained about the same since February. The index
uses 1967 as a base of 100.
   Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board economist, said, "If
business activity is indeed picking up, as we think is the
case, an increase in want-ad volume should start showing up
shortly."
   Regionally, want-ad volume rose in the East South Central
and East North Central areas 5.8% and 4.4%, respectively, but
declined elsewhere.
   Hardest-hit was New England, where help-wanted advertising
has declined 34% in the past year. The Pacific region, down
3.5%, suffered the mildest decline.
   The Conference Board, a business-research organization,
surveys help-wanted advertising volume in 51 major newspapers
every month.

   Hedvig Peterson doesn't know much about the stock market.
But Mrs. Peterson, a widow who is 100 years old, remembers
one lesson from the Crash of 1929: Don't buy stocks on
borrowed money.
   So imagine her surprise when, in late 1988, she got a
margin call for $8,000 to bolster her depleted stock account.
Her broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Daniel Hasbrook,
had borrowed tens of thousands of dollars in her $350,000
retirement account, her lawyer says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. Peterson, a retired Tempe, Ariz., grade-school
principal who is legally blind and partially deaf, had signed
a margin agreement that allowed Mr. Hasbrook to trade in her
account with borrowed money. But on the bottom of it, she
scrawled: "I can't read the above fine print. I sign this on
your recommendation."
   She went to arbitration and, in her complaint, accused Mr.
Hasbrook of making unsuitable investments and trading
excessively to drum up commissions. Last September, a
three-member panel of the National Association of Securities
Dealers ruled in her favor. It ordered Shearson to pay her
$250,000 in compensatory damages, plus $1 million in punitive
damages -- the largest punitive award ever granted in an
investor arbitration case.
   Mr. Hasbrook, now a broker at Sears Roebuck's Dean Witter
Reynolds, says: "There are no rules that say she couldn't be
on margin." He adds, "I don't feel I was ever reckless with
the account."
   The securities industry has long pressed arbitration on
its customers. When opening a brokerage account, many
investors sign a standard agreement binding them ahead of
time to accept arbitration, rather than resorting to a
lawsuit, in the event of a dispute with their broker. But now
the tables have turned: As punitive awards to investors
balloon, arbitration is rapidly becoming a financial threat
on Wall Street.
   That's important because investors have been flocking to
arbitration. They filed 6,101 arbitration cases against
brokers and securities firms in 1988. Data for last year
aren't complete, but the 1988 total was up 115% from 1986. By
contrast, the number of securities-related federal lawsuits
dropped 7% during the same period to 2,775, according to the
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.
   Only a few years ago, securities firms liked the
arbitration process, with good reason. The cases were private
and speedy, and the firms won about half of them. The panels,
which are sanctioned mostly by stock exchanges and
self-regulatory organizations, are typically made up of three
arbitrators, including one securities executive and sometimes
others with ties to Wall Street. They have long been
perceived as stacked against small investors, although this
is vehemently denied by the securities industry.
   More important: Even when securities firms lost, they
typically didn't have to dole out much cash. The awarding of
punitive (or exemplary) damages was relatively rare, and
triple damages under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law were unheard of. No wonder that the
securities industry cheered when the Supreme Court, in a 1987
case involving Shearson, held that the firms could compel
investors to take disputes to arbitration.
   But Wall Streeters aren't smiling anymore. New rules
imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission allow
pretrial conferences and discovery. Hearings that used to
take two days now often take five or more. And the costs are
rising.
   Other SEC rules promulgated last year have opened the
arbitration process to public scrutiny and thus put pressure
on securities firms to settle disputes to avoid bad
publicity. The firms settled 37% more arbitration cases at
the NASD and 25% more at the New York Stock Exchange last
year than in 1988, even as the number of cases filed at the
two bodies fell slightly.
   But the clearest sign of trouble for Wall Street is a
surge in punitive-damage awards. Punitive damages, which are
generally awarded to punish and deter a defendant found to
have acted recklessly or maliciously, are applied in addition
to actual, or compensatory, damages, which cover the injury
or loss.
   Since May 1989, when figures on arbitration awards were
first made public, arbitration panels have granted 21
punitive-damage awards totaling $4.5 million to investors.
That's up from an estimated nine awards totaling $1.7 million
in the year-earlier period, says the Securities Arbitration
Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J., newsletter.
   Large punitive-damage awards are especially upsetting to
securities firms. Shearson, which notes that the alleged
incident involving Mrs. Peterson began when Mr. Hasbrook
worked at E.F. Hutton (which Shearson acquired in 1988),
says: "We don't believe that the facts in this case support
the size of the award, but we have agreed to abide by the
decision."
   Unlike judges or juries, arbitrators don't have to spell
out why they impose punitive awards, and thus they give the
firms little guidance about exactly what they did wrong. And
winning court appeals in arbitration cases is difficult
because federal arbitration law provides only a narrow window
for reversing decisions.
   "The scariest thing as a litigator trying a {big}
arbitration case," says George Schieren, assistant general
counsel at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., "is if you lose, there's no
appellate cushion -- you write the check."
   Securities executives still defend arbitration. Despite
longer cases and the punitive awards, arbitration remains
cheaper and quicker than going to court. Moreover, lawyers at
major brokerage firms say punitive awards are still unusual.
One reason: If lawyers believe that the firm has a poor case,
they try to settle it.
   But big awards are alarming the securities industry. It is
"wondering a lot" about its commitment to arbitration, says
Sam Scott Miller, a former general counsel at PaineWebber
Group Inc. who now works for a New York law firm.
   Says Theodore Krebsbach, Shearson's head of litigation,
who successfully tried the landmark Supreme Court case: "If
the trend continues, at some point you have to say: `What are
we trying to accomplish here?' The purpose of arbitration
isn't to give out windfalls but to make investors whole."
   Attorneys at big firms such as Shearson and Merrill Lynch
say they no longer automatically steer their firms to
arbitration rather than letting the customer sue them in
court. They look at complaints on a case-by-case basis,
weighing the facts and jurisdiction of the dispute.
(Customers have always had the option of forcing a dispute
into arbitration; the 1987 Supreme Court decision essentially
gave the firms the same flexibility.)
   Now, in addition to the increase in punitive damages,
securities firms face the threat of triple-damage awards by
arbitrators under the controversial RICO law, originally
aimed at organized crime. In January, an arbitration panel,
ruling against Shearson, awarded an Oklahoma wheat farmer and
his wife $406,000, split evenly between compensatory and
punitive damages -- plus more than $600,000 in triple damages
under RICO. It was the first time an investor arbitration
panel awarded RICO damages.
   In the case, filed in August 1988, Walter Earl Cox, 61,
and his wife, Ardenia, 60, accused their Shearson broker of
unauthorized trading and said their retirement account was
unsuitable for speculative trading in stock options. In an
interview, Mrs. Cox recalls a 1985 meeting with the broker,
Lindy Kent Ridinger, at the couple's farmhouse. She says he
urged them to sell municipal bonds they held and buy options;
he later bought 4,600 "naked" OEX put options for the account
in seven months.
   An option gives the holder the right but not the
obligation to buy (a call) or sell (a put) a stock or other
investment at a specified price within a stipulated period.
OEX put options are bets that the Standard &amp; Poor's 100-stock
index will fall; a naked option is especially risky because
the investor doesn't own the underlying stocks.
   The Coxes eventually lost about half their $400,000
account when a rising stock market hammered their options
positions, according to papers the Coxes filed with the
arbitrators.
   Shearson disagreed with the size of the award, a spokesman
says, but is abiding by the decision. Mr. Ridinger pleaded
guilty to a federal wire-fraud charge and served four months
in jail. Reached in Dallas, where he now sells real estate,
the 31-year-old Mr. Ridinger says he misjudged the risks of
options.
   "Hey, I'm sorry, I didn't know what I was doing," he says
now. "I never should have messed with them."
   The excessive use of options has triggered several other
big punitive awards. Among them is the case of Leonard Meyer,
a 65-year-old Atlantan. The former wholesale liquor
distributor says he never was a gambler and never believed in
borrowing, not even to buy a car. But he says in an interview
that his PaineWebber broker, Andrew Cinman, kept calling him
with a pitch for a computerized options-trading program. Mr.
Meyer says Mr. Cinman contended that the program minimized
trading risk. "It's a shame you're not taking advantage of
it," Mr. Meyer quotes Mr. Cinman as saying.
   Mr. Meyer says he was wary but agreed when Mr. Cinman
assured him that the options wouldn't expose the account to
losses exceeding $20,000. Between late 1986 and October 1987,
Mr. Cinman made more than 150 option trades, according to
papers Mr. Meyer filed with arbitrators. Then, in the October
1987 stock-market plunge, Mr. Meyer lost nearly $600,000.
   Robert Berson, PaineWebber's general counsel, declines to
comment. Mr. Cinman, who has left PaineWebber, couldn't be
reached. But Mr. Meyer taped a conversation with the broker
just days after the crash. According to a transcript of the
tape submitted to arbitrators, the broker said: "Was I
monitoring the account for a $20,000 loss? Yes. Did it happen
way outside my control? Yes. Was I responsible for that? Do I
feel responsible? Obviously, yeah, I'm responsible." A
PaineWebber executive confirms the authenticity of the tape
but complains that the taping was done without the broker's
knowledge.
   In March 1989, an NASD arbitration panel awarded Mr. Meyer
$745,000, including $500,000 in punitive damages. After
PaineWebber filed a court motion to vacate the award, the
case was settled for about $600,000, according to people
familiar with the matter.
   Of course, just the fact that a broker traded options and
lost a client's money isn't grounds for an arbitration award,
let alone punitive damages. Here are some of the kinds of
cases in which investors stand the best chance in
arbitration, according to David Robbins, a former arbitration
director at the American Stock Exchange and author of a
booklet for investors called "Securities Arbitration Guide":
   Unsuitability: When a broker knew or should have known
that an investment was inappropriate or inconsistent with the
customer's investment objectives.
   Churning: When, to obtain commissions, a broker traded
excessively in a customer's account, in light of its
character, over which the broker had control.
   Unauthorized Trading: When trades were made without the
customer's approval.
   Margin Accounts and Overleveraging: When the broker didn't
explain to the customer, or the customer didn't understand,
that his or her stocks put up as collateral could be
liquidated to meet margin calls. Even if the customer signed
a margin agreement, he or she may not have understood what
the "small print" meant.
   Unlike juries, which are instructed by judges about when,
where and how they can award punitive damages, arbitrators
essentially have free reign. But many arbitrators long
assumed that the law didn't allow them to impose punitive
damages, says Richard Ryder, editor of the Securities
Arbitration Commentator and a former director of arbitration
at the NASD.
   Some securities executives still contend that punitive
damage awards are allowed in arbitration cases only where
state law permits them. But a series of federal-court rulings
in recent years found that arbitrators do have the right to
award punitive damages under the Federal Arbitration Act,
arbitration specialists say.
   Nevertheless, some big financial-services firms still are
trying to fight punitive awards. Dreyfus Corp., the
mutual-fund group, says it is contesting a $50,000
punitive-damage award handed down by an American Arbitration
Association panel. Roman Kent, a New York businessman who
argued the case himself, won the punitive damages against
Dreyfus in March, along with $16,000 in compensatory damages,
after he accused the company of, among other things,
directing him into an unsuitable bond mutual fund.
   "It's a preposterous claim," a Dreyfus spokesman says,
adding that the firm considers the punitive award "totally,
totally out of order." The arbitrators, Dreyfus adds, "have
no authority to do it."
   Of the nation's 10 arbitration forums, the American
Arbitration Association is widely viewed as the most
sympathetic to investors. Unlike exchanges or self-regulatory
bodies such as the NASD, which are subsidized by the
securities industry, the AAA is privately funded. But most
investors are required by their brokerage agreements to take
disputes to the Big Board or NASD forums, which handle 92% of
all arbitration cases. Investors win about half the time in
such forums, and about 60% before the AAA, Mr. Ryder says.
   When investors win punitive damages, the money sometimes
comes straight out of the broker's pocket. When Jana Fong
received $300,000 from the sale of her family's furniture
business in 1986, she called on Michael Goldberg, a friend
and PaineWebber broker, to help her invest it. She gave him a
free hand to trade her account, she says in an interview and
in papers filed with arbitrators. In the next year, he
launched an aggressive naked-option program in the account
and made more than 800 trades.
   Mr. Goldberg, Ms. Fong says, repeatedly assured her that
the account was making money and that he wouldn't risk more
than 20% of it. After the market crashed, however, she was
left with only $11,306, her arbitration filings say.
   Last July, a five-member arbitration panel of the Pacific
Stock Exchange ruled that "the type of stock-options activity
was unsuitable . . . due to the extremely high risk factor."
It added that "there was a substantial failure" by
PaineWebber to supervise Mr. Goldberg. The panel awarded Ms.
Fong $403,000 in compensatory damages and $150,000 in
punitive damages -- $100,000 to be paid by the firm and
$50,000 by Mr. Goldberg.
   "He betrayed me," Ms. Fong says.
   "I felt worse than she did," says Mr. Goldberg, now a
broker at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. PaineWebber declines to
comment.

   LONDON -- France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, one of
the major crude oil producers in the West African state of
Gabon, lifted the force majeure notice it issued May 28 on
loadings of crude from the country's main oil port of Port
Gentil, industry sources said.
   People close to the companies which had received the force
majeure notice said the loading ban had been lifted about the
middle of last week, and that new loading dates for cargos
affected by the move had been received.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Elf imposed the force majeure notice, which informed
buyers of crude from the company that original loading plans
would have to be canceled, following rioting in Port Gentil
to protest the government of Omar Bongo.
   During the disturbances, French troops were sent to Gabon.
Many oil industry personnel and dependents were evacuated and
oil production in the country was considerably reduced.
   Oil output has now apparently recovered, industry
officials said.
   The other main oil-field operator in Gabon, Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, didn't issue force majeure notices during
the disturbances, and cargos loading from Shell's Gamba
loading terminal were only slightly delayed, the sources
said.
   Gabon produces fairly light, sweet crude oil which is
popular with U.S. and European refiners. Its total oil
production is estimated at about 260,000 to 280,000 barrels a
day.

   Recent Share Buy-Back,
   Firm's Stock Performance

   NEW YORK -- Perkin-Elmer Corp.'s onetime chairman and
chief executive, Chester W. Nimitz Jr., said he proposed that
shareholders ask management to put the company up for sale.
   Mr. Nimitz submitted the proposal for consideration at the
company's annual meeting in November. "The essence of the
proposal is that they put the company up for sale, and sell
it in a manner most advantageous to shareholders," Mr. Nimitz
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Based on Friday's closing price of $24.50 a share on the
New York Stock Exchange, the company would have an indicated
value of more than $800 million. Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk,
Conn., is an analytical instruments and material-sciences
concern.
   The 75-year-old Mr. Nimitz, a retired rear admiral, was a
Perkin-Elmer executive for about 15 years; he left the chief
executive post in 1977 and the chairmanship in 1980. He is
the son of Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, the commander of the U.S.
Pacific fleet during World War II.
   In a telephone interview, Mr. Nimitz, who owns 1,000
shares of Perkin-Elmer's 33 million shares outstanding, said
he took issue with the company's recent buy-back of 10.1
million common shares at $24.50 each. The company used part
of the proceeds from the sale of several of its businesses to
buy back the stock. Mr. Nimitz said "the poor suffering
long-term shareholder should have gotten the $240 million,"
or at least had a say in how the money was spent. The company
has never announced how much it received from sales of the
businesses.
   A Perkin-Elmer spokesman confirmed that the company
received a letter from Mr. Nimitz, and said "his views will
be carefully considered by our board."
   Perkin-Elmer announced a restructuring program in April
1989 to sell three businesses: semiconductor equipment,
German avionics and government systems. At the time the
company said it would consider using proceeds of the sales to
pay dividends to shareholders, but so far hasn't done that.
For the year ended July 31, 1989, Perkin-Elmer had a net loss
of $24.2 million on revenue of $784.3 million.
   In May, Perkin-Elmer sold its semiconductor-equipment
business to a group of computer companies, but retained a
stake of less than 20%. The sale had been the focus of some
concern because a Japanese company was reported to have
expressed interest in part of the business. Mr. Nimitz said,
however, that he understood Perkin-Elmer had been in
licensing talks with the Japanese concern. Concerns had been
raised by U.S. semiconductor companies fearing inroads in to
the business by the Japanese.
   Mr. Nimitz said that in comparison with the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index from 1984 to 1989, Perkin-Elmer's
stock "has gone nowhere." In the statement supporting his
proposal, Mr. Nimitz said the dividends "don't even approach
the inflation rate." Perkin-Elmer's quarterly dividend is 17
cents a share.
   The statement says that although the downsized company may
grow modestly, "going forward offers no suitable return" to
the long-term holder who is "already so far behind on his or
her investment."
   Mr. Nimitz, who also sent a letter to Perkin-Elmer
chairman Horace G. McDonell, said he doesn't want to start a
proxy fight, and that he would withdraw the proposal if the
company puts itself up for sale. He said he would begin
contacting major institutional holders soon to seek support.

   LISBON -- The government unveiled plans to slash the
public deficit and lower inflation, in a bid to prevent
Portugal from falling behind as the European Community drives
toward economic and monetary union.
   Finance Minister Miguel Beleza said the economic
adjustment plan would cut public-sector spending and widen
the indirect tax net. Some indirect tax rates may be raised,
he said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Economists have warned that Portugal's large public-sector
deficit has overheated the economy, boosting inflation and
damaging Portugal's chances of meeting EC deadlines for
monetary integration. The government forecasts the 1990
deficit will reach about 610 billion escudos ($4.09 billion).
Inflation in April was running at an annual rate of 12.9%,
about double the EC average.
   Mr. Beleza said the adjustment program will aim to halve
the public-sector deficit in five years to 3.5% of gross
domestic product. Inflation will fall to well below 5% by
1995, he said.
   Portugal must fully participate in EC plans for economic
and monetary union, to influence the shape of the 12-nation
trade block, he said.
   He restated Portugal's commitment to place the escudo in
the exchange-rate mechanism of the EC's European Monetary
System soon, but insisted the adhesion would have to be
handled cautiously. The exchange-rate mechanism fixes nine EC
currencies at a set rate against the European currency unit,
and permits them to fluctuate within fixed limits on either
side of that rate. Portugal, Greece and Britain are the only
EC nations outside the mechanism.

   Panel Rules Most Waste Cleanup Costs
   Must Be Taken as One-Time Expenses

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Companies will have to use a one-time
accounting method, as opposed to spreading the costs over
time -- to cover most expenses for treating environmental
contamination on their property, according to an accounting
panel's decision.
   An exception is the cost of treating asbestos. However,
the panel ruled that for most other cleanup costs, companies
must use so-called expensing, rather than longer-term
capitalizing, which can offer some immediate advantages to
the bottom line.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Many companies had been watching for a decision on the
environmental accounting issue, reached recently by the
Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board. The FASB, located in Norwalk, Conn., is the
chief rulemaking body for accountants.
   The task force addresses narrower issues than the FASB,
but its decisions are applicable to any company following
generally accepted accounting principles.
   Questions about whether companies could capitalize
environmental treatment costs arose after the task force
agreed last October that a company's costs to handle asbestos
problems may be capitalized if the treatment increases the
realizable value of the property.
   "The asbestos conclusion was the springboard of the whole
issue," says Gregory Jonas, a partner in accounting
principles at Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., which brought the latest
issue before the task force.
   Capitalizing a cost on the books gives a company the
advantage of spreading the cost over a longer period, thus
enhancing the bottom line in the near term. Expensing a cost
is a one-time event. In the past, there was a diversity among
companies about whether to expense or to capitalize these
costs, says George Schleier of the FASB staff. The decision
doesn't address tax issues.
   "Basically, what the consensus does is it makes it very
difficult to capitalize the cleanup costs other than in a
purchase transaction where you buy property and improve it"
or in removal of asbestos, says Don Nicolaisen, national
director of accounting services at Price Waterhouse, and a
task force member. Costs of improvements, such as installing
pollution-control equipment, that prevent future
contamination also may be capitalized.
   But Mr. Nicolaisen and others on the task force say that
although companies were given greater discretion to
capitalize costs relating to asbestos cleanup than other
environmental contamination, the distinction between the two
isn't all that clear cut.
   "The essential distinction is between something that
arises in use, as opposed to something that existed when it
was built or at the time of purchase," says Bernard Doyle, a
consultant in corporate accounting at General Electric Co.,
who also sits on the task force. "It's not a perfect
solution, but it seemed to be a reasonable distinction to
make," Mr. Doyle says, noting that asbestos was put in most
buildings as an improvement, whereas much other environmental
contamination is a by-product of industrial processes.
   The environmental consensus "provides a framework for
companies to support a decision to capitalize," says John
Gribble, a member of the FASB staff. Mr. Gribble cites the
example of a company cleaning up a toxic waste dump on its
property. In the past, a company might have argued for
capitalizing the cost because cleaning it up improves it. But
under the consensus on issue 90-8, "all you've done is
restore the land to its original state," so the cost should
be expensed, he says.
   Mr. Gribble notes that "asbestos is a strange bird because
of its dangerous nature." He distinguishes it from other
contaminants by saying that its "mere existence could be
considered to mean a building is unsafe."
   Others aren't so sure about the distinction. "I have a
hard time believing it (asbestos) is any more dangerous than
any of the other things that are out there," such as toxic
waste, says Robert F. Richter, a partner in the national
accounting and auditing department at Laventhol &amp; Horwath.
"There is a difference, but I don't think it goes as far as
they have stretched it," says Jay C. Agarwal, vice president,
technology assessment, at Charles River Associates, a
consulting firm. Mr. Agarwal says the difference is between
accumulated danger and continued danger. Some argue that
leaving asbestos in place doesn't create as much of a hazard
as disturbing it when it is removed.
   The accounting decision doesn't address when to recognize
liabilities related to environmental contamination or how to
measure them, "a bigger problem by far," says Edward Murphy,
director of finance, accounting and statistics at the
American Petroleum Institute in Washington, D.C. Companies
are attempting to assess their liability, but "it's a
horrendous task," Mr. Murphy says.
   General guidance on when to record a liability for
cleaning up these problems is given in the FASB's statement
five. That says the latest you can record a liability for
something like an oil spill is "when you write the check and
the earliest is when you find out about it," says Mr. Jonas
of Arthur Andersen. Liabilities should be recorded as soon as
a company is reasonably certain one exists and that it's
reasonably quantifiable, says Mr. Murphy. But, says Mr.
Nicolaisen of Price Waterhouse, the whole issue of measuring
the liability "is still an evolving process."

   STOCKHOLM -- Stung by ballooning losses in this year's
first four months, Saab Automobile AB's new management moved
to cut costs by closing three Scandinavian parts plants.
   The move launches an overhaul of Saab's manufacturing
operations that was expected following General Motors Corp.'s
purchase late last year of a 50% stake in the Swedish auto
maker. The remaining stake is owned by Saab-Scania AB. In a
separate phase of the overhaul, Saab directors approved a
hefty investment program at the Nystad, Finland, plant where
contract assembly of GM's Opel Calibra model will begin in
March.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Saab said it plans to halt the manufacture of wiring
harnesses at plants in Kramfors, Sweden, and Halden, Norway
-- as well as seat production at two other Swedish
facilities. Buying wiring harnesses and seats from outside
suppliers could cost the jobs of as many as 1,400 workers,
nearly 9% of the total work force, Saab said.
   The moves would save an estimated 200 million Swedish
kronor a year ($32.7 million). That's only about one-third of
the 600 million kronor a year Saab says it plans to save on
parts purchasing.
   Such cost reductions took on added urgency as Saab
disclosed its pretax loss in the four months grew to 995
million kronor from 450 million kronor a year ago. The
company said it expects the "loss rate" to decrease during
the rest of 1990.

   WASHINGTON -- In its bleakest report yet on the
competitiveness of the U.S. electronics industry, the
Commerce Department said Japan could surpass the U.S. in
production of electronic goods by the early 1990s.
   "Except for software and medical equipment, the U.S. has
been losing market share in all products since 1984," said
John McPhee, director of the department's office of computers
and business equipment and a co-author of the report.
Although the U.S. still leads the world with more than $180
billion in annual output of electronic goods, Japan could
spurt ahead by 1994 if the current trend continues, the
report said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The report urges various measures to improve the U.S.
industry's health, including adoption of a permanent
research-and-development tax credit, changes in antitrust
policies, and government actions against so-called unfairly
traded imports and foreign patent violations. But the report
places most of the burden for responding to the Japanese
challenge on the private sector.
   The report shows declines in the U.S. share of world
markets even in such fields as personal computers,
supercomputers and microprocessors, which the U.S. has long
dominated. The study also notes that practically all capacity
for fabricating silicon wafers, the basic material for
manufacturing semiconductors, is now in Japanese and European
hands.
   Moreover, Japan outspends the U.S. in X-ray lithography,
the most promising method for printing the
multibillion-transistor memories of the future, the report
says.
   In 1987, the latest year for which reliable global-trade
figures are available, Japan already led the world in
electronic exports with shipments valued at $38 billion. The
U.S. trailed with $35 billion in exports, followed by the
European Community with shipments of $26 billion.
   A comparison of corporate growth rates between 1983 and
1987 shows Japanese electronic producers to be outpacing
their U.S. rivals; the Japanese companies' sales grew 27.9%,
compared with 10.8% for the U.S. companies.
   In another indicator of how industrial strength is
shifting, three Japanese companies won more U.S. electronic
patents in 1987 than any other companies -- Canon Inc.,
Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. General Electric Co. was next
and N.V. Philips of the Netherlands was No. 5.
   In the past few years, the Japanese have invested heavily
in U.S. electronic capacity, partly to avoid additional
import duties imposed on their personal computers,
semiconductors and electric typewriters. Although these
Japanese-owned operations create U.S. employment, they also
contribute to the U.S. trade deficit because the value of
their imports of components exceeds that of their exports of
final products, the report said.

last installment of "It's the Garry Shandling Show"
(Showtime, Thursday, 10:35 p.m. EDT). This final episode,
entitled "Driving Miss Garry," spoofs the Academy-Award
winning film, and features Dan Aykroyd and Paul Winfield.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Driving Miss Garry" epitomizes everything that has made
Mr. Shandling's series so innovative and so impossible to
watch -- the highlights, the lowlights, the taillights.
   As the show opens, Miss Garry has just crashed his golf
cart. "Last week, when Garry took his driving test, he
knocked down three cones," we're told.
   "Three cones? Big deal]" says a neighbor.
   "The Cohens are a nice Jewish family," interjects another.
   Dan Aykroyd shows up, reprising his Southern gent, Boolie.
"You may be a remarkably spry and independent man of 40 . . .
" he says to Garry.
   "I have my own teeth, I will say that," Garry cuts in.
   "It still doesn't mean you can drive a car."
   Enter Paul Winfield as Hoke the chauffeur. Hoke drives
Garry. Hoke offers Garry advice: "I wouldn't go on
`Letterman.' That man is as crotchety as a crocodile." Garry
teaches Hoke to read: "I've taught millions of kids to read
through my opening credits. . . . Let's sound it out. Corky,
right? Kuh, kuh, kuh -- what letter does that sound like?"
   "Well, it sounds like a K]"
   "Well it's a C. Okay, let's go to the last letter: Corky,
eee, eee, eeeee."
   "It's got to be E]"
   "No, it's a Y."
   And in the end, the two men develop a beautiful and
meaningful relationship. "Your mind took a wrong turn, and
dropped you off at the corner," says Hoke.
   The thing about Garry Shandling is, he's never too funny.
His parodies never venture too far afield into hilarity, they
just sort of putter along. (One typical parody: "I heard him
exclaim, as he rode through the air, Merry Christmas to all,
and to all `How's my hair?'")
   In fact, you'd have to call Mr. Shandling a breakthrough
comedian, a comedian who dares not to be funny. He's a master
of the awkward silence and the embarrassed chuckle. Starting
as a writer for "Sanford and Son" and "Welcome Back Kotter,"
Mr. Shandling got into standup performance at about the same
time David Letterman was coming up, and they share a twisted,
deadpan sensibility. Mr. Shandling often plays in Mr.
Letterman's mode of not-funny humor, although Mr. Shandling
can be much more not-funny. "You rode over the bushes,"
accuses Boolie. "The president and his family? That's
terrible," says Garry. Mr. Winfield delivers an apt review:
"Garry lets fly a real corker every month or two."
   What makes "It's the Garry Shandling Show" so interesting
is its bumbling, self-conscious approach. In most TV
humor-sitcoms, skitcoms, or whatever -- the famous "fourth
wall" is squarely in place; that is, the audience watches a
funny story happening "out there." But with Mr. Shandling's
show, the audience is drawn into the action as another
character, when Mr. Shandling steps in and out of his role to
chat about the events. In this self-aware style, the comedian
will speak a line in character, then comment to the audience
on the size of the laugh he just got.
   "Driving Miss Garry" offers a prime example. Dusting the
house, Hoke finds a large plastic mold in the shape of
buttocks. He pulls it out and frowns at Garry: "You're a very
funny man. No need to resort to a big fake butt to get
laughs."
   "Have you ever had your own cable comedy series?" shoots
back Garry.
   "Well, no sir."
   "I didn't think so. Have you ever made 500 people laugh
just by putting on a big fake butt? I didn't think so. Check
this out."
   He straps it on and cavorts around for a while. The studio
audience howls. Hoke shakes his head.
   "I'm not saying it's not funny. I'm just saying it's not
the right kind of laugh. I bet right now your audience is
pretty ashamed of itself."
   This is the involuted, self-referential way "It's the
Garry Shandling Show" gets its laughs. But for all that, the
series has expanded the boundaries of the small screen. Mr.
Shandling has invented a new middle ground for comedy between
standup, which acknowledges and even plays off the audience,
and the sitcom, which doesn't. He has influenced a group of
younger comedians who are following him on the tube, from
Jerry Seinfeld to Dave Thomas.
   As for the final scorecard: "It's the Garry Shandling
Show" misfired as often as it hit, but that's exactly what a
cable series should be doing. It was, in its own quiet,
fumbling way, a bold experiment. Sure it fell flat on its
face a lot, sure it wasn't funny a lot, but at least there
was some real imagination to it. Which is a pretty rare
commodity these days. (Just look at CBS's recent agreement
with the BBC. The bottom-ranked network is so short of ideas
that, in desperation, it's paying a fee to import them from
overseas.)
   In the end, whatever else you say about Garry Shandling,
you have to admit that he's one of the most talented
vegetarians around. I'll miss him, even though I rarely
watched his show.

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West Germany's gross monetary
reserves eased by 200 million marks to 102.6 billion marks
($60.6 billion) in the week ended May 31, the Bundesbank, the
central bank, said.
   Foreign liabilities rose, however, by 100 million marks to
53.2 billion marks. The bank doesn't publish a figure for net
monetary reserves. But after extrapolation from the available
data, West German net reserves are indicated to have eased by
100 million marks to 49.5 billion marks in the latest week.
</LP>

   The reserve totals stabilized in the latest reporting
week, after a sharp 1.4 billion-mark increase in the week
ended May 23, when the central bank's coffers were swollen by
interest income received from foreign investments, primarily
its holdings of U.S. Treasury notes.

   S&amp;L in Dallas
   Is Purchased

   DALLAS -- Lewis Ranieri expanded his Texas thrift empire
into Dallas Friday with the acquisition of Murray Federal
Savings &amp; Loan Association, a $1.1 billion-asset thrift.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., a federal agency that took
over Murray Federal a year ago, estimated that the
transaction will cost taxpayers $504 million, including an
initial cash infusion of $467 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Ranieri already is chairman of United Savings
Association of Texas, a Houston thrift created under the
Southwest Plan of 1988. Murray Federal was acquired by an
institution formed just three weeks ago by Mr. Ranieri's
holding company, USAT Holdings Inc., to purchase a small
Houston thrift.
   The creation of the new thrift enabled Mr. Ranieri to take
on Murray Federal without violating federal policy that
limits the ability of Southwest Plan thrifts to acquire other
institutions. In keeping with the policy, the new thrift will
maintain capital and operations separate from United Savings,
which was acquired in late December 1988 by an investment
group led by Mr. Ranieri. United Savings has $3.5 billion in
assets and $2.6 billion in deposits at 19 branches, most of
those in the Houston area.
   A spokeswoman said United Savings of Texas eventually will
be merged with the new institution, although the timing "will
depend on government policy" and the government's
re-examination of the original Southwest Plan deal.
   Under the Southwest Plan, the now-defunct Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp. orchestrated a series of mergers and
sales of failed thrifts in the region. Resolution Trust,
under orders from Congress, is reviewing the Southwest Plan
agreements because of the favorable terms granted some
buyers, including millions of dollars in tax breaks and
protection from losses on existing loans.
   In light of the criticism of those deals, the RTC
initially barred Southwest Plan institutions from acquiring
other thrifts. The agency dropped that restriction in March,
as long as the acquired institution was separately
capitalized and independently operated until the RTC's review
of the buyer was complete.
   USAT Holdings acquired Murray Federal through United
Savings Association of the Southwest which was formed May 14
to acquire Ameriway Savings Association of Houston, its four
Houston-area branches and $218.9 million in deposits. The new
thrift also took on $17.4 million of Ameriway's $136.8
million in assets.
   More significantly, the new thrift allowed USAT Holdings
to gain a valuable toehold in Dallas and its suburbs. Murray
Federal had 17 of its 19 branches in the Dallas area. United
Savings of the Southwest acquired the branches, deposits and
almost two-thirds, or $809 million worth, of Murray Federal's
assets, including cash, securities and performing loans.
   In other RTC actions in Texas Friday, the agency sold East
Texas Savings &amp; Loan Association of Tyler to NCNB Texas
National Bank, a unit of NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C. NCNB
acquired East Texas Savings' five branches, $210.3 million in
deposits and just $43.7 million of the thrift's $359.1
million in assets.

   Daiwa Unit Names Merrill's Bradley
   As Co-Head of Capital Markets Business
   ----

   NEW YORK -- The U.S. subsidiary of Daiwa Securities Co.
said it named Stephen W. Bradley, a former managing director
at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s capital markets group, as an
executive vice president and co-head of its new capital
markets operations.
   The Japanese securities firm also said that it planned to
add 30 to 50 people over the next year to increase its U.S.
presence in mergers and acquisitions, capital markets, real
estate, foreign exchange, and mortgage-backed securities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As is the custom at many Japanese financial institutions,
Mr. Bradley will share the top title of his unit with a
Japanese executive. But Daiwa officials said that, in
practice, the 45-year-old American, a specialist in taxable
debt instruments, effectively would run the firm's capital
market operations. His appointment takes effect tomorrow.
   In eight years at Merrill Lynch, Mr. Bradley was mostly
involved in evaluating and structuring debt transactions for
big multinational corporations and foreign governments.
Before joining Merrill Lynch in 1982, he worked for 14 years
at PaineWebber Inc.
   Two-and-a-half years ago, Mr. Bradley established a unit
at Merrill that specializes in putting together debt
offerings for foreign companies and governments. But when
that unit was moved to London at the beginning of this year,
he chose to remain in New York. He said that while he was
offered other positions at Merrill in New York, he decided to
look elsewhere.
   "While leaving the capital-markets opportunities at
Merrill Lynch was difficult, I find the opportunities at
Daiwa challenging and unlimited," said Mr. Bradley.
   In the past, Daiwa and other big Japanese firms have had
difficulty cracking the U.S. corporate finance market,
particularly because of stiff competition from American firms
determined to protect their own turf. In addition, the
Japanese didn't have strong ties to U.S. companies, couldn't
match the ability of U.S. firms to develop sophisticated
products and had trouble retaining talented American
professionals.
   Some investment bankers also questioned the Japanese
firms' commitment to the U.S. market. For instance, Daiwa in
November 1988 laid off about 10% of its professional staff in
the wake of the 1987 stock market crash. Some of those cuts
were in fields the firm now plans to beef up, particularly
corporate bonds and mortgage-linked securities.
   But Daiwa now sees the large cutbacks taking place on Wall
Street as an opportunity to pick up American talent that
otherwise hadn't been available. A Daiwa spokesman said that
most of the 30-to-50 new hires would be professionals. The
U.S. unit currently employs about 370 people.
   Unlike some other big Japanese brokers -- such as Nomura
Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co. -- Daiwa has
refrained from expanding in the U.S. by purchasing stakes in
American firms that specialize in areas such as mergers, real
estate, leasing and money management.
   With an infusion of $100 million two weeks ago from its
Tokyo parent, Daiwa's U.S. subsidiary now has slightly more
than $300 million in capital. The parent company has the
equivalent of $6.2 billion in shareholder equity, making it
one of the world's most heavily capitalized securities firms.

   I object to your May 9 editorial "The Ivory Censor"
describing Wellesley College as part of the national trend
toward censorship on college campuses. Unlike Northern
Colorado University, which rescinded its invitation to Linda
Chavez to be its commencement speaker, Wellesley College did
not revoke its invitation to Barbara Bush.
   A significant minority of the college's graduating class
does not think that Mrs. Bush should have been chosen by its
classmates because her distinction is based on the success of
her husband, not on professional achievement. Nor does it
think that one of the nation's premier colleges for women
should honor someone because of her success as a wife and
mother. The majority clearly did not agree, because it picked
her. The action of the protesters is not an example of
censorship because Mrs. Bush has not been and will not be
censored.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The students were not out of bounds in expressing their
views. Had the college invited Mamie Eisenhower to address
the class of 1960 when I was graduating from Wellesley, I
would have led the protest then. The tiny and diminishing
number of institutions that still maintains standards of
excellence and achievement should honor those values at their
commencement ceremonies.
   I admire the response of Wellesley College's
administration to the affair: The college protected the right
of the minority to express its dissent, as well as the right
of the majority to prevail. Above all, it insisted upon an
atmosphere of civility and reasoned discourse. That's the
American way.

   There is a phenomenon that seems to be pervasive in
academic and corporate America. While professing a quest for
"cultural diversity," institutions have sought refuge in
positioning themselves as the guardians of quality and
excellence.
   Your editorial assumes Prof. Derrick Bell's insistence
that Harvard Law School appoint a black female to its faculty
diminishes his commitment to excellence. You decry that
"merit apparently must take a back seat to race and gender."
We all would join you -- if it were true.
   To frame the argument in those terms takes an arrogant
presumption that there are no black females who can meet and
enhance the highest standards of excellence -- and, by their
mere presence, further diversify the culture of the
institution. Both goals, excellence and cultural diversity,
are ideal, yet achievable.
   The notion that they are mutually exclusive, thus
undesirable, was recently advanced in Allan Bloom's "The
Closing of the American Mind." By documenting and, through
association with his considerable academic credentials,
codifying this halfbaked notion, Prof. Bloom gave hordes of
conservatives air cover to denounce the goal of cultural
diversity -- and to continue their embedded doctrine of
cultural exclusion.

   U.S. and Japanese Officials Approach
   Trade Negotiations With Apprehension

   WASHINGTON -- In what could be the final round of
bilateral negotiations between the U.S. and Japan on
trade-related "structural" economic issues in Tokyo late this
month, U.S. officials are hoping that Japanese policy makers
won't openly advocate a new doctrine that Japan's huge
current-account and trade surpluses are desirable in
maintaining world economic stability.
   For their part, Japanese officials are apprehensive over
the amount of pressure U.S. officials might exert in the June
25-26 negotiations for more specific commitments on future
actions to open up Japanese markets for more imports and
private foreign investments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In advance of these talks, Japanese officials are
indicating that they aren't planning to make any new
concessions to the U.S., such as making advance commitments
on the amount of planned public works spending in Japan as a
percentage of the country's gross national product.
   Japanese officials also are less than enthusiastic about
another U.S. proposal that negotiations on structural trade
issues be "institutionalized" in the form of continuing
consultations several times a year, to rehash old issues and
discuss new ones.
   Meanwhile, the new economic "theology" about the merits of
continued Japanese international trade surpluses, put forward
by some Japanese "think-tank" experts, is viewed as a
potentially troublesome issue, particularly if the Japanese
government were to openly endorse such a strategy.
   Thus far, U.S. reaction has been low-keyed, but several
top U.S. economic policy makers have said this idea lacks
merit.
   As things stand, the U.S. and Japan are slated to produce
in mid-July the final versions of their reports on policy
actions, both in Tokyo and Washington, to achieve a better
balance in trade on a longer-term basis.
   In interim reports issued in April, both governments
managed to ease some of the tensions in their bilateral trade
relations. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and President Bush,
who are expected to get together early next month in Houston,
ahead of the economic summit, probably will be looking for
ways to keep things on a smooth track.
                                                                                                       

   Delays in Congress: General Motors Corp. and other
companies are signing some long-term agreements to supply
equipment and technology to the Soviet Union.
   But they may have to wait until September or even longer
to know whether Congress will approve a bilateral trade
agreement to reduce U.S. tariffs on Soviet goods and, perhaps
more important, clear the way for the Export-Import Bank to
help finance exports of goods and services the Russians want
to buy.
   Separately, it also may take several months for U.S.
companies doing business with China to know, for sure, that
the U.S. will continue its "most-favored-nation" treatment
for imports of Chinese-made goods.
   The House Ways and Means international trade subcommittee,
headed by Rep. Sam Gibbons (D., Fla.) will begin hearings
June 19 on various bills designed to overturn President
Bush's decision to extend for one-year most-favored-nation
treatment for Chinese products, which means lower U.S. import
duties.
   Mr. Gibbons is promising other members of Congress, irked
over the White House decision on China, a comprehensive set
of hearings that will explore, among other things, Chinese
government policies and the impact of trade and investment
ties on the U.S., China and Hong Kong.
   Technically, Congress must decide no later than Sept. 3
whether to uphold (through inaction) or disapprove (through
legislative action) the White House China trade decision of
May 24.
   But some House members are proposing entirely new
legislation that would change the ground rules and set new
conditions for any future extensions of the U.S. tariff
concessions on imports of apparel, footwear, toys, machinery
or other products from China.
   On the Soviet Union, U.S. trade-policy officials were
saying recently they couldn't predict how soon President Bush
would formally transmit the bilateral trade agreement with
that country to Congress, coupling this with approval of
"waivers" under a 1974 Trade act to lower U.S. import duties
on Soviet exports.
   They suggested it won't happen soon because Moscow may
take several months to enact a law allowing unrestricted
emigration of Soviet residents to other countries.
   How Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev resolves Moscow's
problems with the breakaway Baltic states also will be an
important factor in this situation, according to
congressional leaders who discussed this issue with President
Bush at the White House recently.
                                                                                                       

   Credits To Finance Trade: Although the Soviet Union now is
appealing openly for credits from Western nations, including
the U.S., Moscow hasn't gotten around yet to applying for
membership in the International Monetary Fund or the World
Bank, both of which are pumping out funds to other Eastern
and Central European countries to support economic reforms.
   Last week, for example, the World Bank approved a $250
million loan to Poland to help expand natural-gas production
in that country. The bank also has assigned experts to help
Poland work out contractual arrangements to attract foreign
participation in the country's oil industry.
   While some Russian officials apparently are claiming that
they have sought informal, unofficial advice from the IMF
about currency-related issues, IMF officials say that hasn't
happened.
   In the bilateral trade agreement negotiated between the
U.S. and the Soviet Union, it was agreed that commercial
transactions between these two countries would have to be
settled in freely convertible currencies.
   In a separate "side-letter" agreement that could create
new drains on Moscow's limited holdings of dollars, the
Russians promised to begin discussions with the U.S. on
repaying about $714 million in old U.S. government loans,
after the main U.S.-Soviet trade agreement takes effect.
   U.S. officials said these old debts include $674 million
in World War II lend-lease accounts, plus $44 million the
Soviet Union still owes to the Export-Import Bank on loans
approved many years ago.

   Remembrance of Tiananmen Square, that massive year-ago
uprising against the octogenarian tyrants who rule China,
inevitably leads to speculation about the country's future.
One question is whether China's communist system will be
shattered and fragmented by forces similar to those that are
breaking up the Soviet Union. There is a short answer and a
long answer.
   The short answer is that China is not the Soviet Union.
What the Soviets choose to call a "union" is in fact a
Russian empire in which some very harsh instruments of
political control have been used to force peoples of widely
varying nationalities -- from Letts to Armenians to
Moldavians to the Uzbeks -- to submit to Moscow's authority
against their will. As failed communist economic policies
have weakened Moscow's grip, its unwilling subjects have been
heading for the empire's exits.

   But the Chinese, it is argued, are not that way at all.
They -- particularly the Han majority -- think of themselves
as one people. So whatever happens in China, it won't be the
same thing as what is happening in the U.S.S.R.
   Well, that's a short answer, but the long answer is
different and better, in that it explores this question in
greater depth. The process of change will indeed be different
in China, but the result could be similar. The "three Chinas"
that we talk of today -- the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan
-- could be supplemented with some further Chinas. Among the
candidates are Guangdong and Fujian, coastal provinces now
under Beijing's control.
   For that matter, China is not totally without ethnic
diversity. Its western Moslems, not to mention the unhappy
Tibetans, have aspirations for independence not unlike those
in the restive Soviet republics. China's Moslems probably
identify more closely with the Kirghiz rebels who are
fighting Soviet security forces just across the border, or
the Kashmiris who are fighting Indian troops, than with the
Han majority in China. Islam, as we should know by now, has
significant polarizing power.
   But whereas the peoples of the west are driven by ethnic
and religious beliefs, the southeastern coastal provinces of
China are feeling the effects of something altogether
different, economic influences from abroad. Unlike China as a
whole at the moment, they have prospects for significant
economic development. That could, for a number of different
reasons, weaken the political power exercised over them from
Beijing. Their prospects for a degree of both economic and
political independence are considerably better than those of
the western or interior provinces.
   Of major importance to this process is that large and
generally affluent Asian population known as the "overseas
Chinese." These are the Chinese who among other things were
wise and foresighted enough to have left mainland China at
some point before or during the 40 years of communist rule.
Now some are going back, not to live but to look for
attractive investments. A lot of non-Chinese also have made
that search, only to be frustrated by Chinese bureaucracy or
appalled by the Tiananmen Square massacre. But the overseas
Chinese have special advantages. They know the language, the
people and the risks.
   Tiananmen Square proved that the risks are a lot higher
than many Westerners had suspected. They had overestimated
the regime's commitment to political liberalization and
underestimated its willingness to employ mass murder as an
instrument of political control. But the overseas Chinese are
among Asia's most active risk takers, willing to place their
bets early, when things look bleakest. Proof of that is the
fact that they also are putting some money into two other
benighted areas, Vietnam and Burma, apparently out of a
belief that these places too have very little choice but to
move toward political and economic liberalization.
   They have a considerable amount of money to invest. Taiwan
has almost as many dollars in its foreign reserves as Japan
-- some $75 billion. Mainland investments in the hundreds of
millions of dollars by the Taiwanese don't use up much of
that huge chunk but the amount is large by mainland standards
and growing rapidly. A great deal of it is going into Fujian
province, just across the Straits of Taiwan.
   The Hong Kong Chinese, for their part, have been steadily
developing an important economic relationship with Guangdong
province, just to their north, and with its capital Guangzhou
(known as Canton in the old days). An estimated two million
Chinese on the communist side of the border now produce
products for Hong Kong firms, and fully 70% of China's
exports to the U.S. pass through Hong Kong. Western companies
have reaped a great harvest of frustration trying to operate
joint ventures with Chinese government enterprises. Even the
Japanese have been turned off by their unhappy experiences in
China. But the Hong Kong Chinese, by focusing on the kinds of
informal, small-scale arrangements that characterize business
in Hong Kong itself, have by and large made their China
investments pay.
   Some China analysts think that strengthening business
connections with the outside world are pulling even the party
leaders in the coastal provinces away from the Beijing
party's tentacles. If that is true, it could be the origin of
a trend toward "provincialization" in China, with the
separate provinces exercising a greater degree of autonomy
than they have ever achieved in the years since the
communists came to power. The question of whether Hong Kong
might take over China in 1997 -- rather than the other way
around as currently planned -- is facetious. But it is not
out of the question that Guangdong might become more like
Hong Kong, thus representing a buffer of sorts against the
post-1997 destruction of Hong Kong's economy by mainland
communists trying to work their will on that free and
prosperous place.
   But while all this is a hopeful scenario, a very powerful
note of caution is required. The overseas Chinese themselves
are exercising due care in their investments. A good many
Hong Kong citizens are not optimistic and many have migrated
to Canada or elsewhere. There are no economic miracles yet in
Guangdong or Fujian, and there won't be until Beijing's old
men are replaced by leaders willing to make really serious
economic and political reforms. Beijing's control of both
Hong Kong and Guangdong could destroy both. Moreover, other
Chinese provinces, because of the regime's mismanagement,
face very bleak futures -- perhaps even famine -- that could
lead to a political explosion rather than evolution.
   But as the Journal's Claudia Rosett wrote on the page
opposite last week, something will have to change in China.
The anger of the huge crowds that protested in Tiananmen
Square, although suppressed with bullets, made that clear. If
you are making bets on China's future, the possibility of
provincialization, under the influence of overseas Chinese
who have learned how countries achieve economic success,
wouldn't necessarily be the worst one.

   Wall Street Wealth
   Sags, but Salaries
   Of Survivors Soar

SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)

   NEW YORK -- The rest of the country has always thought
Wall Streeters made too much money. Wall Street is starting
to agree.
   Despite several rounds of cost-cutting since the 1987
stock market crash, pay levels at U.S. brokerage firms hit a
record last year, $82,714 for the average employee, nearly
double the level of a decade ago. "Much more needs to be
done" in rolling back compensation levels on Wall Street,
urges the Securities Industry Association, the industry's
main trade group.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In its annual review of Wall Street -- this one called
"From Riches to Rags" -- the securities association notes
what it says is an alarming trend. Since 1980, pretax profits
in the securities industry have plummeted from $16,182 an
employee to $8,093 last year. However, compensation (salaries
plus bonuses) continues to soar.
   Because it doesn't cost Wall Street much to physically
produce its products and services, compensation costs are the
industry's biggest expense aside from interest costs.
   During raging bull markets, Wall Street typically pays
little heed to costs. But now the industry is forced to.
While revenues for the 355 brokerage firms that are members
of the New York Stock Exchange rose 15% last year to $60
billion, rising expenses hammered pretax profits, which fell
26% to $1.8 billion, the third-lowest profit of the 1980s.
(Only profits in 1984 and 1987 were lower.) Pretax profit
margins have slipped from double digits in the early 1980s to
3.1% last year.
   Why is Wall Street still paying itself so much? Tradition,
complains the securities association's research chief,
Jeffrey Schaefer.
   Although the securities industry has slashed 45,000
employees from its work force since the 1987 crash, a cutback
of nearly 20%, "the bulk of departmental trimming began with
staff overcapacity, and the first to go were part-timers,
temps, etc., but rarely the higher-paid department heads or
staff," Mr. Schaefer says. The result: "Per-employee
compensation continues to rise even as profits plummet."
   Overall compensation costs slipped last year at the
biggest brokerage firms because of all the layoffs. But the
rising pay-per-employee figures mean that Wall Street is
stuck in a big-pay mode that will cause continual problems,
says the securities association.
   Samuel Liss, brokerage industry analyst at Salomon
Brothers Inc., questions the relevance of "per-employee"
statistics. But he agrees that Wall Street has relied too
much on trimming staff, rather than taking a hard look at how
it pays survivors.
   "Historically," says Mr. Liss, "the business has too often
defined expense control as being totally dependent on head
count, rather than a reset of compensation schemes."
   Some big brokerage firms -- including industry giants
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and American Express Co.'s Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. -- are making fresh attempts at linking
employee pay with the firm's performance, much as was done
during Wall Street's old private-partnership days. However,
in general, even incentive pay in the industry is too often
tied to how much revenue is generated, rather than actual
profit, says the securities association.
   This revenue focus "will just perpetuate the industry's
trend of growing revenues and declining profits," the
association's report says.
   The association says that Wall Street pay schemes are
"often irrational." For example, systems and secretarial
personnel working for a capital-markets division may get paid
more than similar workers in the operations division, "even
though they basically perform the same function." Also, the
securities industry tends to pay such workers more than their
counterparts in other industries.
   As for high-priced investment banking and broker talent,
Wall Street is in a bind. Firms find themselves forced to
ante up big bucks, even during bad years, to keep top
producers from jumping to competitors -- or as Mr. Liss puts
it, to "the liquid secondary market for disgruntled
producers."
   Other observations in the securities association report:
                                                                                                       

   PRIVATE PLACEMENTS: For the first time, the amount of
money raised through private-placement stock issues in 1989
matched that raised in the public markets. The overall
private placement market, including both stocks and bonds,
accounted for 40% of total funds raised, twice 1980's
percentage.
                                                                                                       

   IN-HOUSE TRADING: Trading gains for securities firms' own
accounts soared 9.2% to $12.3 billion in the year, accounting
for one-fifth to one-quarter of industry revenue.
                                                                                                       

   MONEY MANAGEMENT FEES: One focus of the securities
industry has been an unqualified success. Fees from money
management activities soared 18% to $2.2 billion in 1989.
                                                                                                       

   REGIONAL BROKERAGE FIRMS: Brokerage firms based outside
New York enjoyed a resurgence in the past year, but not as
great as some have believed. Profits slipped after peaking in
the second quarter, and profitability "wasn't evenly enjoyed
by all regional firms."

   Colorado Utility Plans First Operation
   To Turn Landfill Gas Into Diesel Fuel

   NEW YORK -- A Colorado utility plans the world's first
plant to convert landfill gas into diesel transportation
fuel.
   The $14 million plant, to be built in Pueblo, Colo., will
be owned by Fuel Resources Development Co., a unit of Public
Service Co. of Colorado. The plant is being designed and
built by Ultrasystems Engineers and Constructors Inc., a unit
of Hadson Corp., Oklahoma City, an energy, defense and
construction firm.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The plant, which will produce 100 barrels a day of diesel,
plus 50 barrels of naptha and 80 barrels of high-grade wax,
should be completed around year end, Ultrasystems' president,
John P. Coyle, said. The site is estimated to have 20 years'
worth of recoverable gas.
   While there are other plants that recover landfill gas and
turn it into compressed natural gas and other products,
officials of the American Gas Association, a Washington-based
industry group, agreed that Ultrasystems' plant appears to be
the first for converting landfill gas into diesel motor fuel.
   Ultrasystems Vice President Jackson Yu explained that the
plant will take the landfill gas -- which is roughly 50%-plus
methane and 40%-plus carbon dioxide -- and first chemically
break it down into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, or syngas,
using basic petrochemical-plant technology.
   The syngas then will be run over an iron catalyst
developed by Rentech Inc., Denver, and be reformed into a
number of hydrocarbon compounds and water. The hydrocarbon
compounds then essentially will be refined into diesel,
naptha and wax. The refining process is similar to the
technology that's long been used by South Africa's state oil
company to make a wide range of petroleum products from coal,
AGA officials said.
   A spokesman for Public Service of Colorado said the
utility believes there is a big market for its version of
diesel fuel, which it says will be cleaner burning, sulphur
free, and nearly odorless compared to ordinary diesel fuel.
Both Colorado and Southern California have major
air-pollution problems and strict pollution-control
regulations. The spokesman said tests have shown that the
fuel can be used without a major retrofit of vehicles.
   The spokesman declined to say how much the new diesel
might cost, although he said that it will be more expensive
than regular diesel. He added, however, that the price will
be competitive with regular diesel.
   In an interview, Richard Braun, executive vice president
of Fuel Resources, said the company has so far identified
more than 100 landfills in the U.S. and Canada that would be
economically viable candidates for similar plants. He added
that there are probably many more that haven't yet been
located.
   A spokesman for the American Trucking Association said he
hadn't heard of the new fuel. He added that the association
is currently testing several alternative fuels that promise
to be cleaner-burning than regular diesel, and that the
industry is looking for one that is as close as possible in
characteristics to today's diesel fuel.

   Soviet officials and news agencies are describing the
outbreak of fighting in Central Asia as "inter-ethnic," the
expression that also was applied to eruptions in the
Transcaucasus early this year. The description is at best
superficial and at worst deliberately deceptive. What is
mainly going on in Central Asia is a variation on what is
happening elsewhere in the Soviet Union, including the
Transcaucasus, the Baltic states, Ukraine and now Russia
itself: a rebellion against Soviet authority.
   Central Asia, a wild area inhabited by some of the
country's more primitive peoples, might at first glance seem
to be among the least important territories Mikhail Gorbachev
stands to lose as his vast empire crumbles. The sleepless
nights he complained of to Margaret Thatcher no doubt are
mainly attributable to Boris Yeltsin and what he is doing
with the Russian Federation's legislature. Last Friday it
boldly voted to give its own laws precedence over Soviet
laws, directly challenging Mr. Gorbachev's power.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But don't underrate Central Asia. Moscow has a vital
interest there. It's called gold.
   The Soviets have been actively selling gold to earn the
foreign exchange they desperately need to pay their debts and
buy food and other necessities. Central Asia's Kyzil-Kum
desert just happens to be a major center of Soviet gold
mining. The region also is a source of other valuable
minerals, uranium, lead, zinc, oil and gas.
   Which helps explain why the Soviets have just dispatched
several thousand troops to Central Asia to stop "inter-ethnic
strife." That expression is getting a bit shopworn.
"Inter-ethnic strife" between Azeris and Armenians was the
excuse for troops shooting their way into the Azerbaijani
capital of Baku early this year. Chess wizard Gary Kasparov,
an Armenian, wrote on this page in late March his belief that
the KGB stirred up the Azeri-Armenian clashes to provide a
pretext for clamping down on nationalist movements. Indeed,
Soviet defense chief Yazov let the cat out by blurting out in
the midst of the slaughter that the troops were sent in to
save the Azeri Communist Party, which had in effect been
deposed by a national front.
   Uzbek-Kirghiz clashes in the Kirghiz capital of Frunze and
along the border of the two republics are of a similar
pattern. Reading between the lines of Tass and official
reports -- the only sources of information as glasnost
doesn't apply to Soviet hot spots -- one finds that a lot of
the popular anger has been directed at state buildings, 31 of
which have been torched. That's anti-government, not
inter-ethnic. Deaths -- 102 at last count -- seem mainly the
result of shooting by the Soviet regular army, KGB border
guards and Interior Ministry forces. That's a lot like Baku.
   Some anonymous KGB officer may deserve a medal for
dreaming up "inter-ethnic strife." It excuses troop action
and can be used to persuade the world that there will be more
strife, and suffering, if nationalism triumphs over authority
in the Soviet empire.
   The idea isn't foolproof. Efforts to stir up "inter-ethnic
strife" between Russian nationals and ethnic Balts seem to
have fizzled. Baltic Russians seem not to have much more love
for Moscow than do the ethnic Balts.
   Central Asia, for its part, is not as backward as some
think. Popular movements, such as "Ashar" in Kirghizia and
"Birlik" in Uzbekistan, have been gaining strength,
exploiting such sources of discontent as the region's
poverty, conscription of local youths and the dumping of
nuclear wastes near Tashkent, the populous Uzbek capital.
Central Asia also has been able to establish some trade and
political contacts with the outside world. According to a
Radio Liberty analysis, the Uzbeks have had a flurry of trade
delegation exchanges with foreign governments, such as
Belgium and South Korea, and with foreign businesses. Saudi
Arabia sent them one million Korans as a goodwill gesture.
More to the point, the Uzbeks have been in the forefront
among those Soviet republics threatening to seize control of
the resources of their own region on grounds that Moscow is
stealing their natural wealth.
   Uzbekistan's prime minister, Shukrulla Rahmatovich
Mirsaidov, recently issued a declaration of "economic
independence" in a speech to the republic's parliament. He
protested what he called Moscow's exploitation of the
republic. He declared that "all of the most valuable elements
of national possession" must henceforth be recognized as the
property of the republic.
   To Moscow, that meant gold, uranium, oil and gas.
"Inter-ethnic strife" and the intervention of Soviet troops
soon followed Mr. Mirsaidov's declaration.

   Tokyo stock prices sagged Friday, even after some
institutional buying interest, pressured down by light
profit-taking and limited arbitrage selling, traders said.
   In London, shares ended slightly off their intraday lows
in moderately active trading, despite a spate of takeover
rumors and selective institutional buying and
position-squaring on the last day of the current trading
account.

   In Japan, the Nikkei index of 225 issues, which had gained
239 points Thursday, fell 199.21 to close at 32993.29. Though
volume was moderate, traders said the majority of
transactions were connected to the special settlement
price-setting for June options and futures contracts, which
expired Thursday. First section volume was estimated at 700
million shares, up modestly from 660.5 million shares a day
earlier. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first
section issues, which rose 5.37 points on Thursday, fell
16.66 to 2411.78.
   At mid-morning Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index had dropped
293.98 points to 32699.31.
   Participants attempted in the morning session Friday to
drive up prices, as opening prices on the Nikkei 225 index
were used in determining the settlement price for the June
contracts. Settlement price-linked buying was absorbed by
some profit-taking, as the Nikkei 225 index ended the morning
session flat, observers said.
   Because of the consolidation, the fact that some
institutional investors were buying selectively during the
morning was masked, according to the chief trader at a top
British securities firm. The trader said he viewed the buying
as an optimistic sign, pointing out, moreover, that the
Nikkei index's afternoon close Friday below 33000 "is a
reason to be positive" about this week.
   The trader cited a growing variety of views on the
market's future, ranging from upward to sideways, and
indicated the likelihood of a greater focusing on earnings
results and strong company predictions during the next couple
of weeks. Another trader predicted a firmer equity market for
at least one more month, partly because of the steadier
yen-dollar rate.
   Despite this market optimism, stock prices' decline Friday
owed to softness in domestic issues, traders said.
   Daiwa Securities fell 50 yen at 1,590 yen ($10.42). Nomura
Securities slipped 10 to 2,420, Nikko Securities declined 40
to 1,330, and Yamaichi Securities lost 20 to 1,350.
   Nonlife insurance stocks also declined.
   Tokio Marine &amp; Fire fell 20 to 1,490, Taisho Marine &amp; Fire
lost 10 to 1,150, Sumitomo Marine &amp; Fire slipped 10 to 1,140,
and Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine fell 40 to 1,150.
   Nisshin Steel fell 14 to 960, Nippon Steel fell 12 to 608,
NKK was down 16 at 680, and Kawasaki Steel dropped 8 to 612.
   Some consumption-linked stocks, such as retail stores,
were stronger amid the coming Japanese bonus season,
observers said. Tokyu Department Store rose 60 to 1,930, and
Maruzen gained 10 to 1,440.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index ended down 11.8 points at 2366.6, after hitting a low
in retreating 14.5. The intraday high was reached shortly
after trading began, when the index was up 4.6 points. Volume
was 444.2 million shares, compared with 592.5 shares a day
earlier. The Financial Times 30-share index ended down 11.3
points at 1892.7.
   Traders said the market had a healthy consolidation last
week, and is positioned well to try further climbs. Traders
were expecting both Wall Street and London to firm this week,
as "people are buying on the dips rather than selling on the
rallies," one of them said. Also, institutional investors are
said to be flush with cash and looking to buy selectively in
the market.
   The banking and insurance sectors were rife with rumors,
including one suggesting that the merchant bank Midland
Montagu would merge with the securities firm James Capel. But
a James Capel official said late Friday afternoon there
wasn't any substance to the talk.
   The market's anticipation of a joint venture between
Midland and Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking, which holds slightly
less than 15% of Midland, was viewed as a potentially
attractive arrangement. But a general downgrading of profit
and dividend forecasts for the banking sector mostly
pressured the other issues lower. Lloyds, for example, lost
10% since midweek; it closed Friday down 6 pence at 285.
National Westminster eased 9 pence to 345.
   Rumors that Prudential Insurance Co. of America was
planning a move on Prudential Corp. failed to boost its share
price; it ended down 3 pence at 226.
   The Royal Bank of Scotland Direct Line insurance
subsidiary's advertising campaign for discounted
house-contents insurance, which seemed to generate
considerable consumer interest, caused Sun Alliance to
retreat 2 pence to 323, as it has about 15% of the house
insurance market.
   Bass recovered earlier losses, gaining 5 pence to #10.65
($18).
   Imperial Chemical Industries lost 9 pence to #12.16, on a
sterling-related decline. British Aerospace lost 7 pence to
540, on a general downgrading of the defense sector amid
Warsaw Pact changes.
   Fisons shed 10 pence to 374. Its first hearing before the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration's pharmaceutical committee,
seeking approval for its asthma drug, is scheduled for today.
But the market widely expects it to obtain approval, and this
has been factored into the price.
   Elsewhere, stock prices closed lower in Frankfurt, Paris
and Madrid, and were mixed in Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam,
Stockholm and Milan. South African gold stocks closed lower.
Frankfurt trading was thin, as worries about the monetary
union with East Germany and position-squaring before the
weekend weighed on prices.
   In Asia, share prices closed higher in Hong Kong,
Singapore and Manila, were mixed in Wellington and Seoul, and
lower in Taipei and Sydney. Hong Kong stocks jumped 1% in
heavy trading, as early weakness was overwhelmed by brisk
buying in properties shares, stoked by rumors of a local
interest rate cut. In Taipei, prices extended their losses
for the fifth consecutive session, and analysts said many
investors stayed on the sidelines, fearing the market would
decline further.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The

   Credit Markets:
   Junk-Bond Indexes Tell a Confusing Story

   NEW YORK -- Junk-bond indexes are proliferating on Wall
Street these days.
   Securities firms, vying for the junk-bond mantle formerly
worn by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., are eager to see their
names on a widely quoted junk bond index. And so three
different junk bond indexes are being promoted by Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., First Boston Corp. and Salomon Brothers Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In recent months the broad junk-bond indexes have shown
signs of strength for the first time in more than a year. But
before taking the leap into junk bonds, take note: Even the
analysts who compile the indexes warn that the broad averages
can be highly misleading.
   To start with, the three indexes don't even agree on how
well the junk market is doing. Though all three show junk
bonds posted solid gains in May, the returns they show for
the first five months of the year vary.
   While Salomon's index of 472 junk bonds posted a negative
total return of 1.04% for the five months, First Boston's
index of 349 junk bonds showed a negative 0.13%, and Merrill
Lynch's measure of 735 junk bonds reported a total return of
0.20%. Total return measures price changes plus interest
income.
   The disparities -- which reflect the indexes' differences
in composition and sample size -- highlight the difficulties
that investors face when trying to determine how the $200
billion junk bond market is faring. It's an issue that is
getting more attention as investors try to figure out whether
the time is right to venture into that battered market.
   "The average return is a less meaningful number in the
high-yield market" than in other sectors of the bond market,
said Thomas Doyle, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.
   Like many other analysts, he says investors should look at
one small group of junk bonds at a time, considering such
factors as the credit rating, industry group, size of issue,
type of payment (cash, deferred payment or payment in
kind-interest in the form of additional securities) and even
whether the junk bonds were issued as part of a leveraged
buy-out.
   Looking at them in this way brings out some extraordinary
differences. First Boston said its index of information
technology companies' junk bonds showed a total return of
9.5% for January through May, while junk bonds issued by
health care companies posted average returns of a negative
13.1%.
   Sam DeRosa-Farag, an analyst at First Boston, said that
firm can "slice the market into 200 different subsets."
   The broader junk indexes differ largely because each one
is constructed differently. The Merrill Lynch and Salomon
Brothers indexes remove bonds that have defaulted on interest
payments. As a result, these indexes receive a lot of
criticism from money managers, who can't easily purge bad
bonds from their own portfolios. "The indexes that eliminate
busted deals tend to overstate performance," said Thomas
Madden, high-yield portfolio manager at Federated Investors
Corp.
   Merrill and Salomon also exclude noncash-paying bonds,
which are highly volatile. This omission understates overall
market performance when prices are rising and distorts losses
when the market is falling. For example, Salomon's
zero-coupon component, which is not part of the overall
index, rose 5.35% in May while the broad market index rose
2.63%. But in the past 12 months, when the market was mostly
falling, the zero-coupon component fell 15.72% while the
broad market index fell 2.84%. Zero-coupon bonds, instead of
paying interest, are sold at a deep discount, with the
investor collecting the full face amount when the bond
matures.
   Of the three indexes produced by the brokerage firms, many
money managers say they like First Boston's the best, because
it includes some of everything.
   Dan Baldwin, a high-yield investment manager at Chancellor
Capital, said he pays a little more attention to statistics
provided by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. that measure the
portfolio performance of other money managers than he does to
the brokerage firms' indexes.
   This way, Mr. Baldwin said, he's competing against other
"people who are forced to make decisions," rather than "a
theoretical portfolio." The Lipper numbers, he said,
represent "the real world."
   Another measure often used to appraise the relative value
of junk bonds, the yield spread, also falls short when used
as a barometer of the market's health. This compares yields
on a given security with those on a U.S. Treasury security
that has the same or a similar maturity. Because U.S.
government notes and bonds are considered the safest
securities of all, other fixed-income securities are priced
at yields that are higher than Treasurys to reflect their
higher risk.
   When yields on corporate or mortgage-backed bonds, or
taxable equivalent yields on tax-exempt municipal bonds, move
closer to yields on Treasury bonds, they are considered
expensive relative to Treasurys. When yields on these other
bonds are farther from yields on Treasurys, the other bonds
are said to be cheap. Yields on bonds move in the opposite
direction from their price.
   By this measure, the junk bond market is holding a fire
sale. According to Merrill Lynch, the spread between junk
bonds and Treasurys widened from 4.6 percentage points in
March 1989 to 10.2 percentage points in March 1990.
   In a recent Merrill Lynch report, high-yield research
director Martin Fridson and analyst Scott L. Thomas compiled
a list of 118 of the largest non-defaulted junk bond issues
and found that on March 30, 1990, the average yield was
18.83%, or 10.19 percentage points higher than the yield on
the 10-year Treasury note. But within the group, they found,
only eight of the 118 issues actually had yields within one
percentage point of the average in either direction. They
concluded that the concept of an average yield was "highly
misleading," as 93% of the issues were "nowhere close" to
this average.
   There also are numerous technical problems related to
pricing. Unlike the stock market, where there are central
processing systems that verify prices, the bond market is a
market in which each brokerage firm sets its own prices.
   Moreover, the market is so fragmented and illiquid that
most dealers don't even trade 200 different bonds in a day,
out of the 3,000 or so junk bonds that are out there. That
means the folks who produce the indexes often must rely on
price data gathered from so-called street brokers, which
raises questions about the reliability of the quotes.
   And because junk bonds don't always move in sync with each
other, there is no such thing as an average bond that can be
used as a benchmark. Instead, "there are a couple of hundred
in the high-yield market" that could be used as benchmarks
for segments of the market, said Joseph Bencivenga, managing
director of high-yield research at Salomon Brothers who once
held a similar post at Drexel Burnham Lambert.
   Despite these problems, investors and money managers
insist on measuring performance whether or not perfect
indexes exist. That has led a number of investment firms to
scramble to beef up their research abilities to try to
attract new customers.
   Mr. Bencivenga said Salomon is revising its high-yield
index and is considering adding a lot more bonds including
zero-coupon issues, defaulted bonds and securities that have
resettable interest rates.
   This year, Salomon purchased a computer junk bond database
and software system from Drexel, which put the system up for
sale after it filed for bankruptcy-court protection. The
database has names, contacts and trading histories of about
3,000 issues. Salomon also is working on a new "flash" junk
bond index to measure the market's daily performance and
plans to soon begin compiling a daily list of the market's
best and worst performers.

   Friday's Market Activity

   Treasury bond prices ended unchanged to 1/8 point lower,
or down $1.25 or less for each $1,000 face amount, after
drifting in quiet trading.
   The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late in the day at a
price of 103 9/32 to yield 8.44%, compared with 103 14/32 to
yield 8.42% Thursday. Short-term rates were little changed.
   Bond dealers said investors continued to mark time ahead
of this week's deluge of economic statistics, starting with
Wednesday's release of May retail sales data. Also in
prospect are Thursday's report on last month's producer
prices and Friday's report on the May consumer price index.
   In the corporate market, junk bond prices followed the
stock market lower. Most junk bonds, which are
speculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or no
credit ratings at all, ended about 1/4 point lower.
   Traders said the nearly 35-point drop in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average prompted some high-yield investors to sell
junk bonds short, in effect making a bet that their prices
would decline.
   Among the issues that finished lower were RJR Nabisco Inc.
payment-in-kind securities, which pay interest in the form of
additional securities. RJR's 14.07% convertible PIK
debentures due in 2009 finished one point lower at 83 on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   The other widely held RJR issue, the 14.07% exchangeable
PIK debentures maturing in 2007, ended one point lower at 69.
RJR's payment-in-kind bonds are widely held by stock
investors and tend to decline or rebound in step with major
movements on the stock market.
   Junk bonds of Beatrice Co. jumped on news that ConAgra
Inc. agreed to buy Beatrice for $1.34 billion in cash and
stock. The company's 13.71% senior subordinated reset notes
maturing in 1997 rose 2 1/2 points to 104 1/2. Dirk van
Doren, an analyst at McCarthy Crisanti &amp; Maffei Inc., said
the bonds rose on the perception that ConAgra is financially
stronger than Beatrice. In addition, he said, the bonds can
be called at 105 on Nov. 1, and he said ConAgra is likely to
call them because it has a significantly lower cost of funds
than Beatrice does.

   Medicine:
   Increasing Incidence of a Lymph Cancer
   Seen Among Long-Term AIDS Survivors

   SAN FRANCISCO -- In a new twist in the decade-long AIDS
epidemic, doctors say many AIDS patients are beating
infections and living longer only to develop an aggressive
cancer of the lymph system.
   As better treatments succeed in repelling infections,
patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome may survive
the once life-threatening episodes of pneumonia and other
sicknesses to live years longer than they once did. However,
the erosion of their immune system leaves them vulnerable to
a virulent form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the
B-cells produced in the body's lymph nodes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trend represents a major shift in the course of the
epidemic and a setback for the group that previously had
embodied the most hope -- those patients who were long-term
survivors. Meanwhile, what role the drug AZT may play in the
development of lymphoma is unclear, suggesting a new
direction for future AIDS research. Questions surrounding the
drug, which is made by Wellcome PLC, London, are sure to
provoke debate, especially from gay activists who feel AZT
has unfairly dominated the nation's research agenda. Efforts
to reach a Wellcome spokesman were unsuccessful over the
weekend.
   Doctors at major AIDS centers are reporting a steep surge
in the number of AIDS-related lymphoma cases this year. "In
the first three months of 1990, we've more than doubled the
rate from prior years," says Lawrence Kaplan, of the
University of California at San Francisco. "It's an
extraordinary number of what we think of as a fairly unusual
disease."
   At New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston, almost 10% of
advanced AIDS patients develop the lymphoma -- virtually all
of them while taking the drug AZT. Other centers see more,
increasing with length of diagnosis and time on AZT.
   The trend "is real and important. It represents the
clinical evolution of AIDS," says Jerome E. Groopman of the
Deaconess Hospital. Where patients once succumbed after a
swift bout of pneumonia, AZT plus aerosol pentamidine and
other drugs now allay the acute danger of death from
infection, he says. Now, doctors see more chronic
neurological problems, and a wasting syndrome, but the most
striking new feature is the lymphoma, Dr. Groopman says.
"AIDS is a changing disease," Dr. Groopman cautions. "We have
to be flexible and ready to address new clinical events as
they arise."
   Cancer has been associated with AIDS from the start.
Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), a tumor of blood vessels, was the
earliest AIDS-linked malignancy to appear, but its incidence
has declined while lymphoma's has surged. In San Francisco,
for example, KS cases grew at a 2% annual rate in 1986 and
1987, the most recent years for which figures are available,
while lymphoma cases soared 48%, according to a report
published last week by the National Cancer Institute.
   Moreover, cancer is a risk for anyone with a weakened
immune system. People who receive organ transplants run a
heightened risk of cancer due to the immunosuppressive drugs
they take to prevent transplant rejection. Children with
congenital diseases like SCID (severe combined immune
deficiency) also develop more than their share of tumors.
   Studies in the U.S. show lymphoma also is on the rise in
elderly men for unknown reasons, possibly due to herbicides
or other environmental factors, says Robert Yarchoan, a
senior scientist at the National Cancer Institute.
   Still, the rate of AIDS lymphoma -- now approaching 20% or
more for the most advanced patients on AZT -- is two to three
times the expected rate of such cancer in other immune
deficiencies, and even in early AIDS.
   "The critical question is whether AZT is acting to enhance
the lymphoma, or whether the lymphoma is the outcome of a
prolonged immune deficiency," says Dr. Groopman. "Clearly,
people with AIDS develop lymphoma even when they aren't
taking AZT, as do people with organ transplants."
   The mystery of AIDS lymphoma may involve several factors
acting in concert to set the stage for cancer: AIDS, another
microbe, and genetic damage.
   About half of the AIDS lymphoma tumors contain a second
virus, Epstein-Barr virus, a member of the herpes family that
is already implicated in certain other cancers, Dr. Groopman
says.
   Other AIDS lymphomas contain evidence of genetic damage:
breaks in certain chromosomes, or expression of an oncogene,
or cancer-promoting gene, called "myc."
   "You might see that a patient today living four years with
AIDS -- in contrast with someone in 1984 who lived two years
-- might have more such chromosomal damage," Dr. Groopman
said. "My gut feeling is that it's not AZT," he added, but he
plans further studies to investigate the drug's possible
role.
   AZT has been reported to cause vaginal tumors in rodents,
but "We think that's a different mechanism," Dr. Yarchoan of
the cancer institute said. Such a rise in vaginal tumors
hasn't been reported among women on AZT.
   Dr. Kaplan of San Francisco suggests that a potential clue
to lymphoma's origin lies in one of the very first visible
symptoms of AIDS infection: swollen lymph nodes.
   "Those lymph nodes are swollen because B-cells are going
wild," he says. "They're hyperactive and proliferating, so
that they can make antibodies to the AIDS virus. When you
have a patient in that situation, it stands to reason that
the longer their B-cells are proliferating, the greater the
chance that some second event will come along -- either a
second virus, or a spontaneous genetic {mutation}."
   By Dr. Kaplan's reckoning, AZT contributes only "in an
extremely roundabout way, by making people live longer so
they get these malignancies."
   Whatever the cause or causes, the prognosis for patients
with AIDS lymphoma is poor, with an average survival time of
about six months. Treatment so far is limited to the
conventional array of anticancer drugs. Many patients,
however, are too ill to withstand the rigors of chemotherapy,
because their bone marrow is depleted by the disease or by
AZT. Dr. Groopman's clinic has three patients in complete
remission, who are alive three years after treatment of their
lymphoma, but more often the cancer recurs, he says.
   "In the worst-case scenario, we often see a situation like
that with Burkitt's lymphoma, where tumors double in size
overnight," says Dr. Kaplan. "You see a patient, and the next
day, his tumor has grown visibly."
   "They are very aggressive tumors, found in the brain,
lung, and gastrointestinal tract," says Dr. Yarchoan. Unlike
classic B-cell lymphomas, which often crop up in the lymph
nodes, AIDS lymphomas often hide in the brain where their
symptoms may be mistaken for AIDS dementia, which is often
caused by toxoplasmosis, a parasitic infection.
   "It's not uncommon for the lymphoma to be undiagnosed,"
says Parkash Gill, of the University of California Medical
School in Los Angeles. "So for many cases, it may be
unreported."
   Experts are bracing for a rise in the number of lymphoma
cases. "I believe we'll see more of these cases as a result
of antiretroviral therapy, and treatment of opportunistic
infections," Dr. Yarchoan agrees, adding that he and his
colleagues at the cancer institute are analyzing AIDS
patients who developed lymphoma while participating in
treatment studies.

   Loans by U.S. Banks to Latin America
   Borrowers Come Under Scrutiny of Fed

   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is looking into possible
irregularities and improprieties in the handling and trading
of U.S. bank loans to borrowers in Latin America, including
Mexico, Fed officials said.
   These inquiries center on the actions of U.S.-based
creditor banks that also at times have involved nationals
from the debtor countries themselves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
arrived here yesterday on a two-day private visit to the U.S.
to meet with President Bush and to discuss a proposed
free-trade pact with U.S. officials and businessmen. Last
year, President Salinas's government pioneered a landmark
foreign-bank debt settlement, which involved cuts in debt
principal and interest payments, and new loans.
   Several times last spring and summer, Mexican Finance
Minister Pedro Aspe complained to U.S. officials about
suspected financial wrongdoing in the trading of Mexican
foreign obligations, Fed officials say.
   Creditor banks, international companies and other
investors have increasingly traded the foreign obligations of
Mexico and other developing-country debtors ever since the
international debt crisis broke in 1982. In this unregulated
and volatile market, loans customarily trade at big discounts
to face value, and the potential conflicts of interest have
grown for banks that not only trade these credits but also
help to renegotiate them.
   After months of apparent inaction, the Mexican Finance
Ministry last week released details to the Fed of two small
cases involving local companies and nationals who are alleged
to have committed fraud through misuse of Fideicomiso para la
Cobertura de Riesgos Cambiarios, or Ficorca, a government
program through which the foreign bank debt of Mexican
private companies is settled.
   The ministry charged that a Mexican company, Grupo Accion
S.A. de C.V., diverted $8 million in loans from Ficorca to
set up Monytech Inc., a Latin American debt-trading operation
in the Virgin Islands. Eduardo Diaz Rivera Rodriguez, Grupo
Accion's treasurer, also was charged with understating
company income leading to the company's failure to pay 54
million pesos (about $19,000) of tax. The ministry also
presented a separate case against Jaime Ponce Beridgis for
the alleged diversion of $15 million in funds.
   In their public statements about these cases, the Mexicans
didn't mention any foreign banks as being involved. But
foreign banks were originally the holders of private-sector
debt settled through Ficorca, and they often have been
involved in the re-lending of such funds to Mexican
borrowers.
   The Federal Reserve's inquiries however are understood to
be considerably more wide-ranging than such relatively small
Ficorca cases, and they involve examining episodes relating
to several debtor country obligations in addition to Mexico.
A small team that includes banking supervision chief William
Taylor, Fed counsel Virgil Mattingley, and the director of
the international department, Edwin Truman, is understood to
be leading the regulators' inquiries.
   However, when asked for comment yesterday, Federal Reserve
spokesman Joseph Coyne said that he had no knowledge of the
inquiries and declined further comment.
   Since the early 1980s, commercial bank creditors,
international companies and individuals have increasingly
traded the loan obligations of government and company
borrowers from heavily indebted countries in Latin America,
Eastern Europe, the Philippines and Africa. This has led to
the growth of the so-called secondary-loan market, where
annual turnover has now reached into the tens of billions of
dollars. The profits to be made in this market have attracted
investment banks, too.
   Meantime, other units of many of the same commercial bank
creditors also have played a key role in revising terms for
the very loans that are being traded. Big banks have thus had
access to increasing amounts of price-sensitive information
relating to these loans and have faced growing potential
conflicts of interest.
   Big U.S. banks have sometimes moved staff from their
negotiating teams to their trading operations. Traders and
negotiators often have sat in adjoining rooms. At Swiss Bank
Corp.'s New York unit, the same man, Anton Spicijaric, heads
the firm's debt-trading unit and also sits on the committee
that negotiates Mexico's foreign bank debt.
   The practice in debtor countries of allowing foreign banks
to swap loans for local investments also has led to potential
conflicts of interest as banks have been able to reap big
rewards by exchanging old bank debts for local assets.
Advance detailed knowledge of such programs through debt
negotiations, or the ability to get fast local treatment for
a potential exchange of debt through negotiations, can put a
bank in a privileged position if it chooses to trade on these
advantages.
   Prices for developing-country loans have been very
volatile in recent years leading to potentially huge profits
and losses. For example, so far this year, the price for
Mexican government foreign bank debt has risen about 18% to
around 46 cents for each dollar of face value from around 39
cents in January, according to secondary-market traders.
   Information about debt-restructuring negotiations can be
extremely profitable, particularly when the original borrower
was a big private-sector company that may have a bright
future once the debt cloud hanging over it is removed.
   In 1988, the Visa Group, an integrated consumer-products
group that makes some of Mexico's most famous beers,
completed a restructuring of $1.6 billion of its obligations.
These included several hundred million dollars face value of
floating-rate bonds. As the negotiations progressed, the
price for these bonds moved from about 12 cents for each
dollar of face value to around 50 cents for each dollar of
face value in the period from January to August 1988.
   Bankers negotiating the debt restructuring say they became
concerned when it was clear that at least some debt traders
were getting precise details of the restructuring, which only
the negotiating committee and a few Mexican government
officials were privvy to, and were trading on that
information. The details of the restructuring provided strong
indications of the likely direction and value of the debt and
securities of Visa and its subsidiaries.
   Concern among the bank negotiators ran so high that --
after complaints from Paul Friser-Frederiksen, Royal Bank of
Canada's representative on the Visa restructuring committee
-- Michael Chamberlin, a lawyer from the New York firm of
Shearman &amp; Sterling, visited with the bank negotiating
committee in Mexico City to remind the bank negotiators of
their obligations to keep restructuring information
confidential. In recent weeks, Mr. Chamberlin hasn't returned
several telephone calls.

   Tentative Accord Is Reached
   On Status for Quebec,
   But Opposition Remains

   OTTAWA -- Canada's leaders patched together a tentative
agreement that would give Quebec special status and end a
bitter constitutional impasse that has revived talk of
independence in the French-speaking province.
   But continuing opposition in English Canada could still
kill the deal, setting off a full-blown political crisis.
Even if the agreement is ratified, Canada's French-English
squabbling won't end soon. The bitter constitutional debate
"opened wounds in the national psyche," said Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney. After seven days of tough bargaining Mr.
Mulroney and the nation's ten provincial premiers signed the
accord Saturday night. "This is a happy day for Canada," Mr.
Mulroney said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells refused to endorse
the accord, which he said "is bad" for Canada. He signed only
so he can submit the pact for approval to his legislature in
a free vote or directly to Newfoundlanders in a referendum.
   "The future of the country may indeed be at stake," Mr.
Wells said. Calling it "the most difficult decision I've ever
had to make," he said he couldn't support the agreement. But
"I don't want any responsibility for doing irreparable damage
to this country," he added. Newfoundlanders must make their
decision within the next two weeks.
   The agreement is designed to break a deadlock over the
Meech Lake accord, a package of proposed constitutional
amendments. The Meech Lake accord must be ratified by all ten
provincial legislatures by June 23 to take effect.
   In recent opinion polls a majority of Quebecers said they
would support political independence for their province if
Meech Lake isn't ratified. The accord has become an
enormously powerful symbol in Quebec and is the province's
minimum price for remaining happily in the Canadian
federation.
   Three provinces -- New Brunswick, Manitoba and
Newfoundland -- refused to ratify Meech Lake as drafted and
demanded changes. Mr. Mulroney and the ten premiers spent
more than 70 hours behind closed doors last week trying to
find a compromise. New Brunswick and Manitoba dropped their
opposition to the accord but Mr. Wells wouldn't cave in.
   The Meech Lake accord recognizes Quebec as a "distinct
society" within Canada and grants certain new powers to all
provinces. The "distinct society" clause is the key sticking
point in the debate.
   Many English Canadians worry that the clause grants Quebec
special powers that would weaken the Canadian federation. In
one recent poll, only 16% of Canadians supported the
implementation of the Meech Lake accord without change.
   A constitutional lawyer, Mr. Wells has emerged as the most
eloquent and determined opponent of the "distinct society"
clause. A vigorous proponent of a strong federal government,
he gained national attention when he engaged in a heated
television exchange in November with Mr. Mulroney on the
Meech Lake accord.
   In Canada's English-speaking provinces, public-opinion
polls give Mr. Wells a much higher rating than Mr. Mulroney
on the constitutional issue.
   But Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa is just as determined
to defend the measure at all costs. He said anything that
alters the clause "directly or indirectly" is unacceptable.
Quebec Vice Premier Lise Bacon said: "When {Mr. Bourassa}
decides something, there isn't any point in arguing with him.
That's the key to his success."
   If the Meech Lake accord dies, Mr. Bourassa will hold the
future of the country in his hands. He will come under
intense pressure in Quebec to seek political independence. He
may know what he will do if the deal falls apart, but he only
broadcasts his intentions when ready.
   "He's the most enigmatic man I've ever met," said Jean-V.
Du fresne, a Montreal political columnist. "He's like a
pretzel. You don't know where he begins and where he ends."
   An economist turned wily career politician, Mr. Bourassa
calls himself a "practical federalist." Quebec nationalists
think he's a devoted federalist while federalists think he's
a Quebec nationalist.
   If it is adopted, some observers say the "distinct
society" measure will lead to constitutional wrangling.
Eugene Forsey, a constitutional authority, said the "distinct
society" clause is "a trap." If Quebec gets new powers from
court interpretations of the clause "the rest of the country
will feel swindled," he said. But if the rulings don't give
Quebec new powers "Quebecers will say they were swindled."
   Other parts of the Meech Lake accord and Saturday's add-on
agreement set the stage for new battles. The premiers agreed
to a heavy agenda of discussions of further constitutional
changes, including reform of the Canadian Senate, an
appointed body, and writing a new preamble to the
constitution. Both are controversial issues.

   Is Mexico's New Market Economy Here to Stay?

   MEXICO CITY -- The investor from a U.S. bank had come to
Mexico "just to look around," he said. Did he like what he
found, I asked as we were waiting to board the plane home.
"Yes, {President Carlos} Salinas is certainly on the right
track," he answered. "He's opened the country up and pushed
through the privatization of the banks faster than anyone
dreamed possible." But, warned the banker, who claimed to
have lost an earlier investment during the 1982 devaluations
and nationalizations, "they still haven't repudiated the
original nationalization of the banks. Who's to say they
won't change back again?"
   As Mr. Salinas visits the U.S. this week to meet with
investors and legislators, the question is not whether he is
doing the right things, but whether the changes will last.
The revolutionary, market-oriented changes being whisked
through Congress are overwhelmingly popular, both here and
abroad. Even leftist Mexican Sen. Porfirio Munoz Ledo has
recently endorsed, in principle, the most politically thorny
of the open-market policies: a free-trade agreement with the
U.S. and Canada.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the same swiftness and firmness with which Mr. Salinas
has turned around years of protectionist, state planning has
highlighted a weakness in Mexico's political structure that
eventually could derail the economic progress: As Mr. Salinas
and his policies gain in popularity, the political system
that grants him power to make such dramatic changes is less
popular than ever. And that doesn't do much to assure wary
investors that "guarantees" made today will not be rescinded
tomorrow.
   In private, leaders of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) say a complete renunciation of the
past is impossible. As explanation, one is reminded that 35
of the Mexican congressmen who have approved Mr. Salinas's
plans to privatize the banks had, just eight years earlier,
heartily endorsed then-President Jose Lopez Portillo's
nationalization. It is exactly this type of blind allegiance
to the executive that worries investors.
   Guillermo Ortiz, deputy secretary of the Finance Ministry
in charge of the bank privatization, insists that repudiation
of past mistakes is not necessary to draw investors to
Mexico. "The bank privatization is not an isolated move; it's
part of a whole change of policy," he says. Mr. Ortiz
emphasizes that, "the actual privatization is probably going
to be less significant than the process of deregulation of
the banks that started two years ago."
   Indeed, perceived political weaknesses should in no way
diminish Mexico's recent economic successes and its even
greater growth potential. One of the more optimistic
projections is found in a report to be issued July 2 by
Polyconomics, a New Jersey consulting firm with an office in
Mexico: "In terms of size, population, resources, and overall
economic scope, Mexico should be much more than the next
South Korea: by the year 2000, it should be one of the
world's economic powers."
   Among the report's many recommendations for continued
growth and development are a further lowering and
simplification of tax rates, a complete overhaul of the
disasterously inefficient state-controlled farming structure
and a further deregulation of Mexico's emerging equity market
(estimated at about 10% of gross national product).
   On this latter point, Mr. Ortiz says his office has taken
the first steps toward opening an over-the-counter market for
companies currently not big enough to qualify for capital in
the equity market. "As the public gains an ever greater
access to information {about companies} in Mexico, we will be
able to cut back on the regulations designed to protect the
public," Mr. Ortiz says. "We even have private rating firms
now. So, eventually you won't have to have a bank guarantee a
new issue."
   However fast capital market deregulation is introduced, it
would be hard to match the runaway success of Mexico's
supply-side tax cuts. Even so, the government seems
unnecessarily wary of pushing rate reductions much further.
"Yes, we have collected more revenue from lower rates," says
Francisco Gil Diaz, deputy minister of finance for taxation,
"but I think it's too early to call it a supply-side
phenomenon."
   Tax revenues, as a percentage of GNP, increased to 10.5%
last year from 9.7% in 1988, according to Bank of Mexico
figures. One of the biggest jumps came in the revenue from
income tax -- this during a period when the top personal rate
fell to 35% from 40% and the corporate rate fell to 35% from
42%. Revenue from import taxes also grew significantly, again
because of dramatic cuts in import taxes and the resulting
rush of imports.
   Still, current tax laws remain complex and arbitrarily
enforced. One financial writer tells of painstakingly filling
out myriad tax forms only to be told his accounting was
incorrect when he presented it to the tax authorities at one
of the two banks that accept tax receipts. He rechecked his
figures and resubmitted his form to the other bank. There,
his tax forms and payment were accepted.
   Complicated inflation-accounting procedures for tax
computation are beyond the capacities of many of the small
businesses the government hopes to lure back into the formal
economy with reduced rates and better enforcement. A recent
article in El Financiero, a financial daily, told of a
lottery-ticket saleswoman who broke into tears at a bank
because she was unable to fill out a tax form. Mr. Gil Diaz
is unmoved. "Tax laws in Mexico are not too complicated," he
contends. "We hope to do away with inflation accounting by
eliminating inflation."
   Although slow to embrace the success of its tax-rate
reductions, at least the government has rejected the
recessionary "shock" formula urged on it by several of the
multilateral lending institutions that recommend higher taxes
and severe currency devaluations. Renewed confidence in the
currency is paramount in a country where purchasing power has
been eroded by close to 50% since 1983, and as Mexicans gain
access to markets and goods formerly restricted to them. The
government announced two weeks ago that it would slow down
the rate of currency devaluation by 20% (from one peso a day
to 80 centavos). This reduces the annual rate of devaluation
to 10.5% from 14%.
   Not only is Mr. Salinas confident of increased investment
to support the value of the peso, but he is convinced that
Mexico will grow its way out of inflation through tax,
deregulation and investment incentives. So far, he seems to
be right. Inflation came down to 20% last year from a high of
200% in 1987, and GNP increased 2.9% in 1989 and 1.1% in
1988. For next year, government officials privately forecast
a 7% growth rate with 5% inflation.
   All these changes have left the government's political
opponents in disarray. The primary problem for the National
Action Party (PAN) is that the government is doing exactly
what the PAN has been recommending for decades. Thus, the PAN
is losing an important distinction between itself and the
ruling party. Jose Angel Conchello, a PAN member of Congress,
says his party missed an opportunity with the announcement of
the bank privatization: "We knew for some time that Salinas
was planning to privatize the banks. We should have demanded
that the president immediately begin privatizing the banks
and then claimed victory after he did so. We should now be
demanding an immediate change in agricultural policy."
   The left of the political spectrum suffers from the
problem confronting socialist parties world-wide: defense of
an ideology that has been thoroughly discredited. According
to political analyst Lorenzo Meyer, "The Mexican left has
been unable to move from an enthusiastic social movement to a
coherent political party. They may now be trying to redefine
themselves in the image of, say, a Felipe Gonzalez-type of
socialist-against corporate elitism, but in favor of open
markets." Here again, however, Mr. Salinas is one step ahead
of the competition; by subjecting Mexico's business elites to
foreign competition he has cut into any monopolistic
interests the business community had.
   Although Mr. Salinas may not have an opposition party to
worry about, his own party is no longer the leviathan it once
was. The union movement with which the PRI had a 40-year
alliance has lost much of its power due to the emergence of
independent unions and the growth of non-unionized labor.
Charges of electoral fraud continue to haunt the party --
most recently in a local election in the state of Michoacan
two weeks ago. And as practically all restrictions have been
lifted from the Mexican press, detailed reports of corruption
among local PRI administrations have lowered the PRI's
already dismal reputation. Says Mr. Meyer: "The PRI has
become as irrelevent to what is happening in the president's
office as is the left and right. And how long can a popular
president survive as top representative of an
unrepresentative political party?"
   In the long run, the lack of credible political parties is
going to cause some problems for the economic policies being
forged now, no matter how successful or popular they may be.
In September the PRI will hold an important party conference.
There are reports that Mr. Salinas may announce the formation
of a new party to replace the PRI. Any steps he takes to
strengthen the party process in Mexico, at a moment when he
has the political strength to do so, will be vital. That
could be the signal to investors -- both foreign and Mexican
-- that the wise reforms being made today will not be quickly
or easily reversed.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Commerce Department Draws Fire
   Over Correcting Minority Count

   A federal judge criticized the Commerce Department for
taking a "bare minimum" approach to complying with an
agreement that was meant to correct the Census Bureau's
undercounting of minorities.
   Judge Joseph McLaughlin also declared that it would be
constitutional for a statistical adjustment to be made in the
actual census count, if that would make the total more
accurate. Lawyers for New York, Los Angeles and other major
cities say that such an adjustment is necessary to correct
the undercounting of minorities. The Commerce Department,
which oversees the Census Bureau, has questioned whether the
adjustment would be constitutional.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The concept of statistical adjustment is wholly valid,
and may very well be long overdue," said Judge McLaughlin, of
Brooklyn. Judge McLaughlin also raised questions about the
guidelines the Commerce Department has developed for
evaluating whether a statistical adjustment will be made. But
he stopped short of ordering the department to scrap the
guidelines, as the cities and other critics of the census had
requested.
   The attorney handling the case for the Commerce Department
couldn't be reached for comment.
   Peter Zimroth, a partner in the New York office of Arnold
&amp; Porter, who represents New York City, said that under Judge
McLaughlin's decision, "if the Commerce Department chooses
not to adjust {the count}, it will have to prove that the
unadjusted numbers are more accurate."
   The judge's decision stems from a suit filed by New York
and other cities in 1988 over the undercounting. In what was
considered a victory for the cities, the Commerce Department
last summer agreed to develop guidelines for adjusting the
census to make up for the large number of people who aren't
counted. Census figures are used to determine congressional
representation and some federal funding.
   Noting that some of the guidelines "lend themselves easily
to abuse," Judge McLaughlin said the department is "on
notice, if it is not already clear, that backdoor attempts to
evade their commitment will not be countenanced."
   The judge also accused the Commerce Department of
improperly depleting an account that was meant to fund an
independent advisory panel overseeing the issue. The judge
said he will order the Commerce Department to come up with
more funds if necessary.

   BANKRUPTCY JUDGE APPOINTS special adviser to review
funding of Manville trust.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton Lifland, who presided
over Manville Corp.'s Chapter 11 reorganization, named Leon
Silverman to look into allegations that the fund is
mismanaged and inadequately funded.
   It was Judge Lifland's first public response to decisions
issued by two judges raising questions about the trust.
Federal Judge Jack B. Weinstein and New York state Justice
Helen Freedman had told the trust and Manville to return to
bankruptcy court to address the problems, or face possible
harsh measures.
   Judge Lifland said the judges' orders "raise important
issues about the trust and the consummated plan of
reorganization." The trust, which is independent of the
company, was formed as part of the reorganization plan to pay
asbestos personal-injury claims.
   The trust and the company praised the appointment of Mr.
Silverman.
   In turning to Mr. Silverman, a partner at Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, Judge Lifland is bringing in one
of the chief architects of the reorganization plan that
allowed Manville to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings in
1986.
   Mr. Silverman, who represented future personal-injury
claimants, was closely involved in deciding how the trust
would be funded.

   FDIC WILL APPEAL reversal of $6.5 million verdict in
bankers' bonds case.
   The case involved a dispute over a bond covering C.H.
Butcher Jr., former chairman of United Southern Bank of
Nashville, Tenn. The ruling has broad implications for claims
against officers and directors of failed banks. Bankers'
bonds are a form of insurance against fraud or other misdeeds
by officers and directors.
   "I think it {the ruling} has the potential to be read
beyond the facts of this case," said Mark I. Rosen, deputy
general counsel for litigation at the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   In this instance, Mr. Butcher and other bank employees
were covered under a bankers' blanket bond issued by Aetna
Casualty &amp; Surety Co., a unit of Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co.
Under the terms of the bond's provisions, coverage would be
canceled "immediately upon the taking over of the insured
{bank} by a receiver or other liquidator or by state or
federal officials." Coverage could be extended under some
circumstances, but the bond denied state and federal agencies
the right to extend the coverage. The provisions are common
to most bankers' bonds.
   Aetna cited the provisions when it rebuffed the FDIC's
request to purchase bond coverage after the bank failed. When
Aetna rejected the FDIC's claims for losses on five
fraudulent loans arranged by Mr. Butcher, the FDIC sued to
collect under the bond.
   During the trial last year, a judge ruled that Aetna
couldn't use as evidence the provisions of its bond involving
renewal and cancellation by a federal agency. The judge said
the provisions were void because they were "contrary to
public policy."
   The jury awarded the FDIC $3 million under the bonds and
$3.5 million in punitive damages. It ruled that Aetna had
acted in bad faith in failing to extend the bond coverage.
   Aetna, represented by the Washington, D.C., office of
Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, appealed, and late last month, a
panel of the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the
verdict and ordered the suit against Aetna dismissed. The
appellate panel took exception to the trial judge's exclusion
of the bond provisions. "The dominant public policy exposed
by this review is that the parties' freedom of contract must
not be disturbed," the panel wrote.
   Last week the FDIC filed notice that it will seek a
rehearing by the panel, saying that "this reversal presents
several issues of exceptional importance, including an
adverse impact on the stability of the national banking
system and the FDIC's insurance fund."

   PUBLISHING MILLIONAIRE is sentenced for failing to
maintain tax records.
   Peter M. Brant, 43 years old, of Greenwich, Conn., was
sentenced to three months in federal prison, five years of
probation and ordered to serve 500 hours of community service
and pay a $200,000 fine for two tax violation counts. Mr.
Brant owns a newsprint company, Bato Co., its subsidiary,
Riviere du Loup Newsprint Ltd., and Brant Art Publications.
   Mr. Brant, along with his cousin and business partner,
Joseph Allen of New York, pleaded guilty last April to a
scheme to defraud the federal government of $1.5 million by
charging substantial personal expenses to their companies,
then reporting the expenses as business deductions and
failing to maintain records from which their taxable income
and tax could be determined.
   Mr. Brant and his attorney were not available for comment.

   WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers said it would be "irresponsible" for the Federal
Reserve not to reduce interest rates if Congress and the Bush
administration settle on a budget that substantially cuts the
federal deficit.
   "The Federal Reserve could offset any such fiscal
contraction" resulting from a deficit accord, said Michael
Boskin, the top economic adviser to President Bush. "It
should, and it would be irresponsible if it didn't."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Boskin said, however, there was "no formal deal"
between the Bush administration and the Fed to lower rates.
"If there's a serious, credible, multiyear budget deal
accomplished, that should take a lot of pressure off of
long-term interest rates, and it should give {the Fed} the
elbowroom to lower interest rates," Mr. Boskin said yesterday
on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
   Fed officials have indicated in recent days that they are
happy with the current "moderately restrictive" monetary
policy, as Fed Gov. Edward Kelley described it. Though some
indicators, such as slow employment growth, have pointed to a
stalling economy, Fed officials are concerned about a
continuing threat of inflation and see no signs of weakness
in some other statistics such as the level of inventories.

   NEW YORK -- Amax Inc. said its board approved an amendment
of its dividend reinvestment and stock-purchase plan that
ends, effective immediately, the discount on reinvested
quarterly cash dividends.
   The plan, which was started in 1979, offered a 5% discount
on reinvested dividends. A spokeswoman for the metals and
energy company said the action was taken to protect long-term
holders and to "reduce certain abuses" of the program,
including arbitrage, excessive trading or transaction profit
activities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Several companies, particularly banks, have been changing
their dividend reinvestment programs. Typically,
institutional investors buy up blocks of a company's stock
before the dividend is declared to take advantage of the
reinvestment discount, then sell soon after, which drives the
share price down.
   Amax said that as of March 1, 42% of eligible shareholders
participated in the plan. A total of 27% of the 87.4 million
shares outstanding participated. The last regular quarterly
dividend of 20 cents a share was payable June 1 to stock of
record May 10. The next regular dividend is payable Sept. 1
to stock of record Aug. 10.

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)

<LP>
   When we think of coercion, we usually think of government
as the culprit. Sometimes the government can be the solution,
as when the Supreme Court justices last week repeated their
admonition that groups with mandatory membership may not
force members to fund political activities they oppose.
   This time the offenders were, ironically, lawyers. The
defendant was the state bar of California, which all lawyers
in the state must join and fund through dues. Dissident
lawyers brought Keller v. State Bar of California because
they objected to politicking by the state bar funded with
their compulsory dues. The California bar has actively
supported gun control, nuclear-freeze ballot initiatives and
an unlimited right to sue anyone who causes air pollution.
This kind of ideological lobbying has nothing to do with the
purpose of the bar, the "regulation of the profession and
improvement to the administration of justice."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A unanimous Supreme Court cited Thomas Jefferson. "To
compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the
propagation of opinions which he disbelieves," barrister
Jefferson wrote, "is sinful and tyrannical." It also violates
the First Amendment free-speech rights of dissenting members.
The court did uphold the practice in some 30 states of
requiring fee-paying bar membership by all lawyers. This
looks like a closed-shop union, but the justices couldn't
quite bring themselves to view fellow lawyers as mere guild
members.
   So lawyers can continue to be required to belong to state
bars and pay dues, but at least none of their dues can go for
pushing ideological goals they oppose. This could also quash
proposals in several states to have mandatory "pro bono"
(free service) requirements, which could be met by financial
contributions to special-interest and typically left-wing
litigation groups.
   While this is good news for lawyers, other workers keep
getting misinformation from the National Labor Relations
Board. We wrote last year that the NLRB was not informing
workers of their rights under the 1988 Supreme Court decision
Beck v. Communications Workers of America. This case said
that workers don't have to become full financial members of a
union, and workers are obliged to pay union dues covering
only collective bargaining. Workers do not have to pay for a
union's political activities or any other non-bargaining
activities.
   The National Right to Work Committee last year discovered
that NLRB literature made no mention of the workers' new
rights granted by Beck, and that NLRB officials tended to
describe incorrectly what union activities workers were
compelled to pay for and which they were not.
   The NLRB hasn't cleaned up its act. Steve Kerekes of the
NRWC cites NLRB literature that states the so-called
financial core members who "object" to the "use of their
payments for non-representational purposes" might be
compelled to pay for the "union's costs of representational
activities (such as collective bargaining, contract
administration, and grievance adjustment)." Although the NLRB
defends this language, it's at the least misleading.
   Beck doesn't even allow the collection of dues for
non-bargaining purposes. Further, the "such as" before the
list of union activities workers must fund seems to leave the
door open for union activities, such as politics, that are
prohibited.
   Whether or not NLRB bureaucrats agree with Beck, it's the
law. Even lawyers sometimes have to sue to ensure their
rights against their bar groups. It's time the NLRB at least
made sure that workers know what their rights are.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Cypress Semiconductor Corp. said a
Soviet technology group agreed to grant the company a license
to make chips designed by the group and to use the groups'
manufacturing technology.
   Soviet chip-making technology is thought to be as much as
10 years behind that of the U.S. and Japan. But Cypress
President T.J. Rodgers said the Soviets have some excellent
chip designs and manufacturing processes, such as waste
disposal, that look promising on paper. Technology
constraints have forced bright Soviet engineers to build more
efficient circuits than those of Western chip makers, he
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Their tech is 1978 but they've got a lot of frustrated,
very talented people" who have ideas and designs that could
translate into competitive chips if made in the U.S., Mr.
Rodgers said.
   Representatives from the Soviet group visited Cypress's
headquarters last week and showed the company a list of
Soviet-designed chips, including chips that process voice
signals and perform functions needed in high-definition
television, Mr. Rodgers said. Under the agreement, Cypress
will put $100,000 in an escrow account from which the Soviet
group, the International Center for Informatics and
Electronics, will withdraw royalties.

   TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- A faulty Toyota pickup design was
cited as a jury awarded $5,270,000 to a woman for injuries
suffered in a 1984 accident.
   Officials with Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc., a
subsidiary of Toyota Motor Sales Ltd., said the award was one
of the largest ever imposed against the company. Attorneys
for the company said an appeal would be filed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Superior Court jury also awarded $100,000 to the two
daughters of Cynthia Gosper, 35 years old, of Garden Grove,
Calif., who was left a quadriplegic from the accident. The
daughters suffered minor injuries in the same accident.
   Jurors found that a design flaw in the 1981 4-wheel-drive
SR5 pickup Mrs. Gosper was driving allowed it to roll off a
highway after it was struck from behind. The driver's side
door popped open, throwing Mrs. Gosper from the truck.
   Toyota attorneys insisted that the truck's design is safe
and that the force of the collision caused it to roll over.
   Sam Cole, an analyst with the Center for Auto Safety, a
Washington-based consumer group, praised the outcome. "I
think the jury was correct in their decision that the vehicle
was designed in an unstable manner," he said.

   Steps Out of Bounds

   WASHINGTON -- The words "Social Security" never seem to
provoke clear-headed thinking in Congress, and this year is
no exception. With surprisingly little debate and less
deliberation, Congress and the administration have all but
agreed to take Social Security out of the official
calculation of the budget deficit. "We're going to take
Social Security off budget," says Sen. Pete Domenici, a New
Mexico Republican. "There's no doubt."
   Many Democrats and some Republicans talk about balancing
the budget over the next several years without counting the
annual Social Security surplus. But considering their
inability to make progress toward a balanced budget even with
the $63 billion Social Security surplus, it's a pipe dream.
"Macho talk," says House Budget Chairman Leon Panetta, a
California Democrat.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nevertheless, in the Washington political hothouse,
rhetoric has a way of driving policy, and the rhetoric
surrounding Social Security is thick. Sen. Daniel Moynihan, a
New York Democrat, started all this when he accused his
colleagues and the president of "thievery" by relying on the
regressive Social Security payroll tax to fund other
operations. The competition to talk tough on Social Security
has escalated since.
                                                                                                       

   This isn't simply a matter of accounting. Some experts to
whom Democrats usually turn say that taking Social Security
off budget could prove to be the biggest blunder Democrats
make this year. While politicians love to proclaim that they
have "protected" Social Security, these experts look beyond
oratory and don't like what they see. "Democrats are shooting
themselves in the foot by supporting this," asserts Isabel
Sawhill of the Urban Institute.
                                                                                                       

   For one thing, segregating Social Security would make
cutting the deficit much tougher. The program is at the root
of the surge in spending of the past two decades -- from 15%
of the budget in 1970 to 21% today. Budget experts long have
assumed that any deficit fix would include restraint in the
growth of benefits for older folk.
   By removing Social Security from deficit totals, however,
the budget summiteers would eliminate any incentive to trim
the program. "If it's not part of the problem, it's not part
of the solution," says Robert Reischauer, director of the
Congressional Budget Office. So much for promises about
sharing the sacrifice of deficit reduction.
   Social Security beneficiaries won't object, of course. But
with such a big piece of the budget exempt, the rest of it
would get squeezed all the harder to reduce the deficit.
Higher taxes and lower defense spending wouldn't suffice;
popular spending programs such as the war on drugs and
federal aid to education would surely suffer. Congressional
advocates of taking Social Security out of the budget "don't
realize what a terrific crimp it'll put on domestic
spending," Ms. Sawhill says.
   Moreover, removing Social Security from the budget might
weaken rather than strengthen the hallowed trust fund.
Currently, Congress can't tap Social Security funds without
increasing the deficit and risking the Gramm-Rudman law's
across-the-board spending cuts; this has kept Congress from
raising benefits for certain age groups or using Social
Security taxes to pay for long-term health care.
   If Social Security is removed from the budget, however,
the limited discipline of the Gramm-Rudman law would
disappear. Mr. Reischauer says the Social Security trust fund
could become a "honey pot" that legislators would dip into to
provide more benefits to seniors, weakening the trust fund's
ability to cope with baby-boomer retirees in the next
century.
                                                                                                       

   To take Social Security off budget could be a recipe for
the failure of the budget summit. The spending cuts and tax
increases required to balance the budget without Social
Security anytime soon could prove politically impossible. For
this reason, White House Budget Director Richard Darman keeps
urging the summit to agree on a deficit-reduction package and
then to write new accounting rules to accommodate it.
                                                                                                       

   Given the pitfalls, why is Congress so determined to take
this step?
   Many members want to boast that they've protected Social
Security without having to vote for the costly payroll tax
cut proposed by Sen. Moynihan. And some Republicans suspect
that Democrats are trying to make the deficit look huge so
President Bush will have to raise taxes. Another theory has
Democrats using the Social Security move as a wedge to weaken
or eliminate the Gramm-Rudman law and thus avoid the pain of
deficit-reduction altogether.
   Conventional wisdom to the contrary, politicians often do
what they promise. But if they take Social Security off
budget, they may come to regret it.

   Worsening Social Climate
   Could Doom Collor's Plan

   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Eduardo Marinho says times here are
tough. So he wants a raise -- of 166%.
   That may seem like a lot, but Mr. Marinho, a 34-year-old
engineer at Light, a Rio electricity utility, says such a
raise would only make up for Brazil's inflation since
February. This inflation, he says, wasn't compensated for in
salaries as in the past because of a wage-and-price freeze
imposed by President Fernando Collor de Mello as part of his
drastic anti-inflation plan unveiled in March. Mr. Marinho,
along with 14,000 other Light employees, went on strike last
week to drive home the wage demand.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Brazilian workers feel the same way,
and are putting increasing pressure on the government to
relax its grip. Strikes are starting throughout the country,
and the powerful left-wing union, Central Unica dos
Trabalhadores, is calling for a broad strike tomorrow.
   The wage issue has become the principal problem facing the
government, and many fear the worsening social climate could
doom Mr. Collor's bold plan only three months after its
inception.
   "There's a general sense that the whole thing is going
down the drain," says economist Edmar Bacha.
   Inflation has been brought down from 84.32% for the month
preceding the plan to 7.9% for May, but there are widespread
expectations that it will soon be back in double digits --
particularly if the explosion of wage claims continues. The
centerpiece of the stabilization plan -- an 18-month freeze
on close to 70% of the money circulating in the Brazilian
economy -- has proved to be ineffective as most companies
have found a way around it.
   Despite pockets of recession, production in many sectors
is approaching pre-plan levels. Some people predict a
consumption boom because the government destroyed faith in
savings, and many economists say the government faces a
difficult choice: more inflation or a deeper recession.
   "Until now, Collor has achieved some results without a
deep recession," says Carlos Langoni, a former Central Bank
president. "But now, especially if {wage-and-price}
indexation returns, the only way to avoid a return of
inflation is to follow a very tough monetary policy and
accept a much longer and tougher recession than he thought."
   The most immediate challenge is on wages. When a few
categories of workers got regional labor courts to support
their claims for 166% wage increases, the government, fearful
that this would mean the return of inflationary indexation,
sent Congress a bill that would have deferred all such wage
decisions for six months. But Congress, handing Mr. Collor
his first political defeat, voted down the bill.
   Undeterred, Mr. Collor drew up a similar bill. This was
rejected Wednesday by the Supreme Court on the ground that it
is unconstitutional to resubmit a bill that has been
rejected. Reacting to the second defeat, Economics Minister
Zelia Cardoso de Mello said not to expect any "measures of
great impact" from the government, but said it would fight
any wage increases through more recessionary policies.
   But many say the government has to take the offensive on
wages if it wants to avoid an inevitable rush of demands
following the Supreme Court decision.
   One solution, many economists suggest, would be to work
out with Congress a wage policy that would allow some form of
indexation on current inflation for low salaries and work out
a timetable to compensate for past residual inflation.
   "They have to pull out some sort of sensible
wage-and-price agreement," says Mr. Bacha. "If they just
leave things open, people will try to grab everything they
can at the first opportunity. Clearly, 166% is a crazy
number, but it's not so crazy if you anticipate a return of
inflation."
   Paradoxically, another factor fueling worry is that the
economy is doing too well. When the government first unveiled
its plan, many economists felt the tight monetary squeeze --
believed to be one of the greatest liquidity crunches in
history -- would trigger a sharp recession. For the first few
weeks, they were right. Activity dropped markedly in the
weeks following the plan. Some entire sectors, such as the
automobile industry, virtually ground to a halt and a number
of industries, such as construction, resorted to mass
layoffs.
   But now, the griping is mostly limited to small companies.
   In most industries the talk of gloom and doom has all but
disappeared -- a sign that the government's liquidity squeeze
failed as companies found loopholes, such as using frozen
funds to pay off taxes, to unblock their blocked money and
relaunch activity. In the auto industry, for instance, Jacy
Mendonca, the president of the National Association of
Automakers, says 1990 production should equal that of 1989,
even though three of the four auto makers operating in Brazil
stopped output totally for five weeks in the wake of the
plan.
   "Business has improved substantially in the past 30 days
and has almost returned to normal," says Andre Beer,
vice-president of General Motors do Brasil. "This is
completely unexpected. If you're being selfish, from a
business point of view that's good," he says. But, he adds,
"we're going back too fast to a 100% level and you can run
into inflation." Since Thursday, however, GM's plant in Sao
Jose dos Campos has been paralyzed by workers demanding the
166% wage increase.
   In a bid to keep production from rising so rapidly and to
crack down anew on excess liquidity, the government has taken
new steps to bring monetary policy in line, including
stringent targets to curb the expansion of money supply and
restrictions on consumer credit.
   The government also vows to forge ahead with its plans to
cut 20% to 25% of Brazil's public sector work force and
publicly offer most of its deficit-ridden state-controlled
companies. Both of these moves are viewed by businessmen as
vital to cutting Brazil's public deficit. But many are
skeptical and question the government's ability to meet its
target of producing a $7 billion public-sector surplus this
year.
   Although the start of the soccer World Cup gives the
government some respite -- Mr. Collor flew to Italy to watch
Brazil's first game yesterday -- it will have to act fast on
the wage and monetary front to quash rising inflationary
expectations.
   The economic minister "is right to say that if we start
giving out 166% increases, we're back where we started from,"
says the president of a European corporation here who
requested anonymity. "But what she says amounts to saying: `I
know you haven't eaten in eight days, but that's not a reason
to eat 16 meals at once.' They'll have a hard time convincing
people."

   DEARBORN, Mich. -- The Michigan Court of Appeals granted a
stay Friday of an earlier state regulatory order blocking CMS
Energy Corp. from completing the sale and leaseback of
Midland Cogeneration Venture assets.
   The ruling was the final hurdle for the transaction, which
is scheduled to close June 15. State utility regulators had
been trying to stop the sale and leaseback, saying that
unregulated CMS Energy was trying to move assets from its
regulated Consumers Power Co. utility unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But while the court allowed the deal to take place, it
also required Consumers Power to post a $450 million bond to
cover possible customer refunds.
   The Michigan Public Service Commission ordered the posting
of the bond because it questioned whether CMS corporate
restructuring and asset transfers violated a special 1985
order that allowed the utility higher rates to stave off
financial collapse. CMS officials previously said they
wouldn't post the bond, but a company spokesman said that
position has been changed to permit the sale and leaseback to
go through.
   The appeals court also decided not to immediately take up
the question about the state commission's jurisdiction in
restricting the transfer or use of CMS interests in the
cogeneration venture. CMS said the court said it will handle
that issue "under normal appellate procedures."

   Delays in A-12

   2nd-Period Charge Due

   General Dynamics Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. said
they probably will face second-quarter write-offs because of
delays in developing the A-12, the U.S. Navy's highly
classified, next-generation attack airplane.
   Neither defense contractor would spell out the potential
size of the charge or the reasons for the setback. But
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the companies
apparently were encountering problems with the composite
materials that will give the A-12, known as the Avenger 2,
its stealthy characteristics. The Navy, which is now
conducting a special review of the project at the instigation
of the companies, said specifically that there have been
difficulties in setting up the tooling to manufacture the
aircraft.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is an enormous program, at the very edge of the
limits of technology," Jim Cunnane, General Dynamics's chief
financial officer, said. "We can go racing on through the
thing, or we can slow it down and . . . reduce the technical
risks."
   But the companies also seem to be scrambling to mitigate
their financial risks. Lawrence Harris, who has closely
tracked the A-12 as aerospace analyst for Bateman Eichler,
Hill Richards Inc. in Los Angeles, pointed out that the
companies may rapidly be approaching the $4.8 billion
cost-ceiling on their fixed-price-incentive development
contract -- after which they must absorb any overruns.
   Last week, according to the Navy, General Dynamics
temporarily laid off about 60 employees at Air Force Plant
No. 3 in Tulsa, Okla., the final assembly location for the
A-12. "Additional manpower reductions by General Dynamics and
McDonnell Douglas may be required to control costs associated
with the change in schedule for the aircraft's first flight,"
a service spokeswoman said.
   Separately, General Dynamics said last week that it will
lay off between 500 and 800 employees in the next two months
at its Fort Worth, Texas, fighter division as part of a
previously announced plan to reduce employment at the
division by 7,000 by the mid-1990s.
   Mr. Harris also said the $1.5 billion in revenue that the
companies had expected to split evenly this year from the
A-12 could be reduced as a result of the delay in the first
flight. He said the firms, both based in St. Louis, took in a
combined $900 million last year from the program.
   Neither McDonnell Douglas officials, Mr. Cunnane nor John
Lamers, the A-12 program manager in Fort Worth, would
disclose exactly when they had been expecting the airplane to
be ready for use. However, McDonnell Douglas indicated that
the milestone has been postponed "beyond early 1991 until
later the same year."
   The news of the A-12 comes atop a recent disclosure that
another high-cost aircraft, the Air Force's Advanced Tactical
Fighter, also will have its first flight delayed. That's
because of snags with the engines.
   The A-12, which is set to replace the aging A-6 Intruder
fighter-bomber by the mid-1990s, is one of the nation's most
expensive weapons programs with a $52 billion price tag. It
is also the Navy's top priority to deploy the aircraft, and
the military expects to buy about 620 A-12s in all.
   John Betti, the Defense Department's acquisition chief,
said in a statement that he was "very concerned" about the
A-12. Sources said he was taken aback by the contractors'
admission of the problems and questioned why they hadn't
surfaced during the Pentagon's major aircraft review, which
Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney delivered to lawmakers in
April. The review had suggested "everything was on track and
on time," one official said. "Now, if the schedule slips and
the price goes up, it could become real controversial on the
Hill."
   Mr. Cunnane stressed that it was impossible at this point
to figure how big a hit to earnings his company might be
forced to take, explaining that General Dynamics's executives
would meet among themselves to determine new scheduling and
cost projections. "It will be a couple of weeks before we
come to grips with what the implications of the problem are,"
he said.
   In the year-ago second quarter, General Dynamics had net
income of $58.4 million, or $1.39 a share, on sales of $2.53
billion. McDonnell Douglas, stung by a $72 million write-down
to reflect cost overruns on its C-17 cargo plane, had a net
loss of $48 million on revenue of $3.48 billion.
   The companies made their announcements about the A-12 late
Friday, after the final bell at the New York Stock Exchange,
where General Dynamics finished in composite trading at $36,
up 12.5 cents. McDonnell Douglas closed on the Big Board at
$45.875, up 12.5 cents.
   The Navy said its review of the A-12 program will
encompass design, cost and production scheduling, as well as
Navy funding and "contractor performance." The Navy is set to
complete its review this month.
   "To the extent that the program changes," Mr. Cunnane
said, "we're looking to the Navy to cover the cost."
   To some degree, that is analogous to Lockheed Corp.'s
experience on the P-7 anti-submarine aircraft. The Calabasas,
Calif., aerospace concern took a $300 million write-down last
year after it made a miscalculation on the design of the
plane. Now, it's in negotiations with the Navy to
re-establish cost and scheduling formulas.
   But Mr. Cunnane insisted that the A-12 mess didn't result
from any earlier design deficiencies. "What this does is put
the emphasis on technical success," rather than on timing, he
said.

   WAYNE, N.J. -- GND Holdings Corp., parent of Grand Union
Co., said its net loss in the fiscal fourth quarter widened
as depreciation and amortization of assets increased
following the purchase of the supermarket chain.
   For the 12 weeks ended March 31, the loss widened to $14.4
million from $12.4 million a year earlier. Sales grew 2.5% to
$653.1 million from $637 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the year, the net loss widened to $53.8 million from
$14.9 million. Sales rose 7.3% to $2.92 billion from $2.72
billion. For the year, earnings before depreciation and
amortization, last-in, first-out accounting provisions,
unusual items, interest and taxes rose 20% to $170 million
from $141.5 million. Total interest expense increased to
$136.7 million from $95.3 million.
   GND, whose principals include the New York investment
firms of Miller Tabak Hirsch &amp; Co. and Salomon Inc., acquired
Grand Union in July in a leveraged buy-out. GND said that for
comparative purposes, results of GND for the 36 weeks
following the purchase were combined with results of GU
Acquisition Corp., the predecessor company, for the 16 weeks
before the acquisition. The combined results are compared
with those of GU Acquisition for the year ended April 1,
1989.
   Earnings for the year before LIFO provision, depreciation
and amortization, unusual items, interest and income taxes,
increased 14% to $39.5 million from $34.8 million. GND said
results below the line of earnings before LIFO provision,
depreciation and amortization, unusual items, interest and
income taxes, aren't comparable on a year-to-year basis,
because of the acquisition of Grand Union last July.
   Interest expense in the quarter rose to $35.6 million from
$24.5 million.
   The purchase agreement last year called for the Miller
Tabak-Salomon group to pay $60 million for an 80% stake, and
for management to pay $15 million for the remainder. The
buyers also assumed about $300 million in existing debt, and
said they would refinance $545 million in bank debt and issue
about $325 million in new, high-yield junk bonds.

   Foreign Franchisers Entering U.S. in Greater Numbers

   It all seems modest enough: Goemon Inc., Boston, owns but
a single restaurant, a Cambridge, Mass., Japanese-style
noodle shop that opened last year. Because of high start-up
costs, the restaurant isn't even showing a profit yet.
   All the same, Goemon is preparing a franchising program.
It aims to have its first franchisee up and running,
somewhere between Boston and Chicago, later this year and
five to 10 more next year. Its majority owner, Yashuhide
Sunamura, already owns more than a dozen successful noodle
shops in Japan. Moreover, the company-owned test unit in
Cambridge "is doing extremely well, better than we had
anticipated," said Eleanor Arpino, vice president of Goemon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Goemon is one of many foreign firms increasingly making
inroads in this country through franchising techniques that
American companies largely pioneered. The moves come as
American franchisers are pressing into new foreign markets,
lately including Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   The foreigners think they have innovative businesses that
will stand out even in the crowded American franchising
market.
   Roche-Bobois U.S.A. Ltd., New York, a pioneer among
foreign-controlled franchisers in the U.S., began operating
in this country in 1974 and has 24 U.S. franchisees, which
sell leather seating pieces and other luxurious furniture of
French design. Michael Lerner, executive vice president, said
the concern brings in a high-income clientele "that's
difficult to duplicate." Besides, becoming a franchisee is
the only way that any American store can sell the name-brand
furniture line.
   Sometimes, foreign franchisers are entering the American
market by acquiring existing franchising operations. But the
foreigners also are gingerly nursing new U.S. franchising
businesses. In either case, it's foreign-based franchising on
a scale experts say they haven't seen before.
   "We are seeing foreign companies catch on to the
advantages of franchising in ever-increasing numbers," said
Patrick J. Boroian, president of Francorp Inc., an Olympia
Fields, Ill., franchise-development and consulting firm. The
foreigners most interested in the U.S., he said, are from
countries, such as Canada and Japan, where American
franchisers have had notable success, providing inspiration.
   For example, Ceiling Doctor International Inc., based in
Toronto, has sold 16 ceiling and wall-cleaning franchises in
the U.S. since 1987. Moneysworth &amp; Best Shoe Repair Inc.,
also of Toronto, last year opened its first U.S. shoe-repair
outlet, in Washington, D.C., which it subsequently sold to a
franchisee. Meanwhile, the company sold 17 more U.S.
franchises.
   Keith J. Kanouse, a West Palm Beach, Fla., lawyer and
franchising consultant, said foreign interest in U.S.
franchising "gets larger each year." Mr. Kanouse said he
attended the National Restaurant Association convention in
Chicago last month and encountered about 20 small companies,
largely from the Far East and Latin America, all considering
franchising their restaurant concepts in this country.
   Until recently, most American franchisers have been nearly
free from direct foreign competition. But now "reverse
franchising," as the spread of foreign franchising into the
U.S. is called, could mean new pressures and problems for
many U.S. businesses, including franchises. Foreigners
offering franchises are often competing for the same
investors as American franchises. They and their franchisees
are also competing for the same spaces in malls and the same
consumer dollars.
   Like their American counterparts, foreigners who turn to
franchising aim to attract managers and capital faster than
they could do so through strictly company-owned operations.
Typically, franchisees finance their outlets, while paying
fees and royalties to the franchisers.
   But reverse franchising often proves more costly and
difficult than franchisers expected, and thus may be
well-suited only to large, wealthy franchisers. John L.
Scott, president of Fastframe USA Inc., an Agoura, Calif.,
franchiser controlled by British shareholders, advises
prospective franchisers from overseas: "Whatever you think
it's going to cost you to get started, quadruple it." Federal
and state regulatory demands on franchisers are enormous in
the U.S. compared with those in many European countries, he
said.
   David J. Kaufmann, a lawyer in New York, said foreigners
seeking to franchise nationally are often shocked to learn
that 16 separate regulatory filings are required, one with
the Federal Trade Commission and one each for 15 states with
their own franchise registration laws. Moreover, the
foreigners are unaccustomed to the level of disclosure in
each document.
   Franchisers accustomed to Europe are also taken aback by
U.S. demographic patterns, Fastframe's Mr. Scott said. In
British towns, for example, well-heeled consumers can be
counted on to shop in downtown areas alongside poorer
customers, Mr. Scott said. In U.S. cities, by contrast, a
downtown location "could be the death knell for your
business," he added.
   Despite the difficulties, Fastframe has opened 89 U.S.
franchises, offering custom framing and related services,
since 1987. Potential rewards outweigh costs, Mr. Scott said,
because "the U.S. has five to six times the market potential
of the U.K."
   Still, the start-up costs are expected to deter many
foreign companies from attempting to franchise in this
country. Philip F. Zeidman, a lawyer in Washington, D.C.,
said: "Not a lot of small companies are going to be willing
to try this. It's the larger franchisers that are going to be
interested." Mr. Zeidman predicts that more foreign
franchisers will enter the U.S. through giant acquisitions,
rather than starting up their own operations.
   In the absence of acquisitions, building a franchise chain
can be slow. Thousands of franchisers are competing for U.S.
investors. "The main problem is coming up with qualified
people," said Roche-Bobois's Mr. Lerner. Roche-Bobois still
lacks franchisees in such large cities as Pittsburgh, St.
Louis, New Orleans and Atlanta.
   Others, though, see no such shortage. Buth-Na-Bodhaige
Inc., a Cedar Knolls, N.J., unit of Body Shop International
PLC of Britain, began franchising Body Shop outlets, which
sell toiletries and cosmetics, in the U.S. this year. In
addition to 17 company-owned Body Shop outlets in this
country, there are four franchises. Ranjit Singh, franchise
director, said there's no lack of prospective franchisees.
"When we last counted, we had over 5,000 letters of interest
on file," he said.

   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The chairman of USAir Group Inc. said
the nation's seventh-largest airline will postpone delivery
of a dozen new aircraft for more than three years because of
sluggish business.
   Edwin I. Colodny, chairman, said the airline would delay
delivery of the Boeing Co. planes from 1991-92 to 1995.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   USAir spokesman John Bronson confirmed the statement and
said the planes involved are all Boeing 737s.
   Mr. Bronson said the proposal to defer delivery until 1995
was included in Mr. Colodny's recent letter to all USAir
employees.
   In exchange for delaying the deliveries, USAir agreed to
buy 24 more planes from the manufacturer and purchase options
on 56 more aircraft after 1995, Mr. Colodny said.
   USAir has one of the airline industry's younger fleets and
will delay retiring some planes, Mr. Colodny said.
   USAir had a loss of $76 million in 1989 after 13
consecutive profitable years; it posted a $38 million loss
for 1990's first quarter.
   In last year's annual report, the company said it had
commitments to buy five Boeing 767s before 1992 and 55 Boeing
737s before 1993.
   Projected spending on new planes was $882 million this
year, $767 million in 1991 and $264 million in 1992, the
report said.

   The international exchange rate for the Soviet ruble
should be made consistent with its real buying power starting
July 1, Soviet Finance Minister Valentin Pavlov said in an
interview with the government newspaper Izvestia.
   Mr. Pavlov said the ruble exchange rate should be changed
to reflect its real value before new wholesale prices are
introduced in 1991. Without saying what the changed rate
should be, he said a realistic ruble rate would help the
government to make up losses in revenues caused by production
shortfalls.
   "The federal budget failed to receive three billion rubles
{$4.9 billion} over the past four months," he said. "If this
tendency continues, the losses will have reached 10 to 12
billion rubles by the end of the year."
   Last year, the Finance Ministry established a special
ruble rate for tourists, selling six rubles for one dollar.
The move was an effort to slow down the thriving black market
for dollars.
                                                                                                       

   U.S.-JAPAN SATELLITE ACCORD
                                                                                                       

   Japan and the U.S. signed an agreement on procedures to
allow U.S. companies to expand sales in the Japanese
satellite market. The accord followed a basic agreement
reached in April to allow U.S. satellite manufacturers to
compete on an equal footing for all Japanese government
satellite projects except those for research purposes. Under
the new accord, the Japanese government and its agencies must
announce their plans to buy satellites in official
publications, thus informing potential bidders, the Post and
Telecommunications Ministry said.
                                                                                                       

   INVITATION FOR KLM
                                                                                                       

   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines confirmed it has been invited by
Argentina to participate with a group of air carriers and
banks to study the privatization of the Argentine national
airline, Aerolineas Argentinas. The Argentine government has
asked several parties to help with the process. KLM was asked
for either cooperation or participation in the privatization
effort, said a KLM spokesman, adding, "We are just studying
their request." The spokesman said KLM wasn't looking for a
stake in the airline when it is privatized.
                                                                                                       

   LIECHTENSTEIN'S BANKING LAWS
                                                                                                       

   The government of the principality of Liechtenstein
announced it had prepared a draft revision of the tiny
nation's banking laws. Among other measures, the draft
legislation would extend supervision to cover certain
financial companies that have so-called parabank functions.
The government is also preparing other legal measures
designed to prevent misuse of the principality's financial
center. These measures are to cover such activities as
insider trading and money laundering.
                                                                                                       

   FRIENDLY MOVE BY CHINA
                                                                                                       

   China will allow Korea Air Lines, South Korea's national
carrier, to use Chinese air space for regular flights, South
Korean Transport Ministry officials said. China had prevented
KAL from flying through its air space, forcing its flights
from Seoul to the Middle East to detour through Thailand, an
airline spokesman said. The flights over China will begin
Friday night. The KAL spokesman said flying over China would
cut travel time between Seoul and Bahrain by two hours and 50
minutes.
                                                                                                       

   CONCERN IN SINGAPORE
                                                                                                       

   Businessmen in Singapore are concerned about the
increasing cost of doing business there, the outgoing
chairman of the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce
said. Boon Yoon Chiang said office rentals in the republic
had increased by 59% in 1989 and are projected to rise a
further 20% to 30% in 1990, while the consumer price index is
expected to rise by 4% in 1990 as there are currently clear
signs of inflationary pressures. Mr. Boon said the business
community is also troubled by a labor shortage.
                                                                                                       

   AUSTRALIAN POPULATION GROWTH
                                                                                                       

   Australia's population reached 17 million in March,
growing by one million over the past four years.
   The Bureau of Statistics said the previous increase of one
million took nearly five years, and the million added before
that took nearly six years.
   Migration into Australia is running at high levels. Over
the past four years net overseas migration added 500,000
persons, the same number as the natural increase of births
less deaths. Main sources of migrants in the past four years
were Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, the Philippines, Vietnam,
Malaysia and Hong Kong.
   Australia's five major cities account for 60% of the
population, with most of the country sparsely settled.

   Guam is offering a pickup truck to the person who can
collect the most brown tree snakes in a one-month period
starting June 23. The 212-square-mile U.S. Pacific island
territory is home to more than two million of the snakes,
which it wants to exterminate because they have decimated the
native bird population. The reptiles were accidentally
imported during World War II, possibly in military shipments
from the Solomon Islands. . . . China's Communist Party
expelled a former vice minister of railways and eight others
in the Railways Ministry for accepting bribes. Luo Yunguang,
the former vice minister, was ousted for accepting a gold
ring, a refrigerator and cash amounting to a bit more than
$600.

   Travel:
   American
   Near Liftoff
   To Tokyo

   American Airlines, in a blow to archrival United Airlines,
won a government recommendation to fly a coveted route to
Tokyo from Chicago, the base of United's operations.
   Acquisition of the nonstop route, pending approval by
several Transportation Department officials, would be a big
revenue generator for American, a unit of AMR Corp. United, a
unit of UAL Corp, had projected it would gain $300 million in
revenue annually from the route.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The route would bolster American's bumpy campaign to build
a world-wide route system. It also would boost American's
business at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, the
country's busiest airport, where American has been trying to
erode United's dominant position.
   The Chicago-Tokyo route is one of six to be parceled out
by the Transportation Department. The Department, under a
pact with Japan, is to grant passenger and cargo flying
rights between six U.S. cities and Japan, with three serving
Tokyo, and the remainder other cities. Along with the
Tokyo-Chicago route, American won recommendation for a
proposed route between Tokyo and San Jose, Calif. Delta Air
Lines also won two recommendations, with America West
Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines getting the remaining two.
   Thomas Mahoney, public counsel at the Transportation
Department, made the recommendations late Friday, naming
first and second choices for six proposed routes. The contest
for the routes is considered the biggest in at least a
decade.
   Mr. Mahoney recommended that United, which has waged a
tough lobbying campaign, only get dibs on the Chicago-Tokyo
route if American turns it down. Called "backup authority,"
that is little consolation because second-choice carriers
rarely take over a route.
   But a spokesman at United said: "This is a very early
stage of the proceeding. The case is far from over."
   William Kutzke, a consultant in Washington who compared
the competition for the routes to the Indianapolis 500, said:
"You can win from the back of the pack, but it's not likely."
   An American spokesman said officials weren't prepared to
comment over the weekend.
   Final approval isn't expected until late this year. In
early August, John J. Mathias, chief administrative law judge
at the Transportation Department, is slated to make separate
recommendations, in effect using Mr. Mahoney's
recommendations as a guide. Mr. Mathias's choices in turn
will be reviewed by two senior department officials and the
White House.
   If American opts not to fly the route between Tokyo and
San Jose, where the carrier has built a hub of operations,
Mr. Mahoney recommended Delta Air Lines for a route between
Honolulu and Tokyo.
   Mr. Mahoney recommended Delta for a route to Tokyo from
Los Angeles, a huge focal point for overseas travel. American
was recommended as a backup. Delta also was recommended for
service between Portland, Ore., and Nagoya. The backup is
Continental Airlines for Seattle-Nagoya flights. Hawaiian
Airlines was picked for Honolulu-Fukuoka flights; Continental
also is the backup, with a Los Angeles-Nagoya route; America
West was recommended for Honolulu-Nagoya, again with
Continental as a backup.

   Tracking the Economy:
   Producer, Consumer Price Reports Pack
   A Double Punch on Inflation This Week

   NEW YORK -- For the first time in memory, producer and
consumer price reports hit back-to-back in the same week. Not
for the first time, both inflation gauges are expected to
rise in the same month.
   Normally, wholesale prices precede the important CPI by
about a week, giving economists time to adjust their main
inflation forecasts. "They're going to get no chance at all
to revise" this time, said Patrick Jackman, chief of the CPI
branch of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The May CPI, due
Friday, comes right on the heels of Thursday's PPI report.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The week's other indicators take the latest pulse of an
economy that has recently been slowing. They include: May
retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilization,
as well as April's trade deficit and business inventories.
   But the inflation data are likely to steal the statistical
show because already-disclosed reports have set the tone for
most of the other numbers. Economists expect an uptick in
producer prices after two months of declines. The consensus
view calls for a 0.2% increase, according to MMS
International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. Consumer prices are
thought to have again increased, with the consensus also
expecting a 0.3% rise. In April, the CPI rose 0.2% and in
March it jumped 0.5%.
   The CPI trackers have been working for some time to shave
days off the release date of the index. Traditionally, the
CPI takes longer to gather since its market basket is
compiled throughout the month. The PPI reflects one sample
day. Economists noted that eclipsing the time between reports
(bureau rules prohibit sameday disclosure) could heighten
analysts' anxiety on months the gauges move in different
directions. Such discrepancies aren't that uncommon, largely
because the CPI is heavily weighted toward services, while
the PPI doesn't measure services at all.
   Richard Trainer, senior economist at Bank of Tokyo in New
York, is in the camp that expects both inflation gauges to
rise a bit in May. But he's expecting only a 0.1% increase in
May producer prices, largely because of the past behavior of
prices for basics like feeds, foodstuffs and natural gas. "I
think we'll see some increase in some food and energy prices
at the consumer level, too," Mr. Trainer said. He expects
about a 0.2% rise in the CPI.
   He and some others expect cooler inflation over time.
"We're coming off some very, very high inflation numbers that
were driven by special factors late last year," he said.
Among the quirks, he cited unusually cold weather and a sharp
runup in apparel costs. Mr. Trainer noted that the recent
economic sluggishness indicates "we're going to see some
relief in demand pressure on prices. Then we'll actually see
some dust settling down." But he added: "It takes a while,
perhaps {until} late summer or early fall. But then we're
back into the winter season."
   Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bancorp.
in Philadelphia, believes that a flattening trend in money
supply portends cooler inflation down the road. A
decelerating money supply would be "very significant" to
produce the slow-growth scenario necessary to sustain his
lower-inflation forecast.
   Mr. Levy has one of the most optimistic inflation outlooks
for the rest of 1990 and for 1991. "By the end of 1991, we'll
be in the 3.25% range, maybe a little lower," he said.
   The consensus view on retail sales, due Wednesday, expects
a 0.1% rise, following April's 0.6% drop. Sluggish auto sales
are expected to again act as a drag on the overall number.
Economists are particularly interested in any gains in
apparel sales to determine if discounting drove up volume or
whether prices held.
   Industrial output and capacity utilization, due Friday,
are expected to rebound slightly. The consensus view calls
for output to rise 0.4%, which would put the operating rate
around 83.2%. In April, industrial production slipped 0.4%
and capacity utilization was 83%.
   Economists continue to expect slow improvement in the
trade deficit. April's deficit report, due Friday, is
expected to narrow to $7.5 billion, following March's
widening to $8.4 billion.

   New Electronic Bulletin Board Promises
   To Make Trading Foreign Stocks Easier

   From an Aruba hotel to a Zambia mine, the stocks of
companies in just about any corner of the world are easier
for U.S. investors to buy with this month's launch of the
over-the-counter market's new Bulletin Board.
   That may be a blessing or a curse.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since June 1, such well-known international names as
Volkswagen, Nestle and West Germany's Deutsche Bank have
begun popping up on the computer screens of dealers using the
OTC Bulletin Board. Just one week old, the electronic system
allows eligible dealers to indicate twice daily the prices
they're willing to pay for hundreds of foreign securities,
previously quoted once a day in the Pink Sheets.
   Traders say the new system, while it has its "bugs,"
promises to make it easier and more efficient to trade
international stocks. But one regulator who is keeping a
close eye on international securities says let the investor
beware.
   "At this point, I would suggest it's premature for
individual investors who aren't sophisticated to develop
significant portfolios in foreign issues that aren't traded
on the New York exchange, the American exchange and Nasdaq,"
says Walter White, Wisconsin's Commissioner of Securities and
head of a group of state securities regulators that monitors
international stocks.
   "We're coming out of a period where we have just witnessed
substantial abuses and losses of individuals' money in the
savings and loan scandal," Mr. White notes. "We run the risk
of similar catastrophes if Americans, without firmly
understanding their risks, get involved in overseas
investments."
   The first week brought a fast start for the OTC Bulletin
Board, which is meant to shed new light on the murky world of
the low-priced Pink Sheets stocks. More than 100 dealers --
twice the number expected -- used the system in its first
week to advertise prices or interest for about 3,000 U.S. and
foreign securities, says the National Association of
Securities Dealers.
   More than two-thirds of price quotes for U.S. stocks were
firm, an "astounding" figure, says John T. Wall, executive
vice president, marketing operations, for the NASD, the
self-regulatory body for the OTC market. In other words,
dealers stood ready to buy 100 shares or sell 100 shares at
their quoted prices. Other dealers just indicated possible
prices or gave phone numbers, much as they do in the Pink
Sheets.
   Unlike Nasdaq or exchange-listed stocks, those flashed
upon the Bulletin Board's 2,700 screens needn't meet minimum
standards for size, net worth or financial soundness. And
foreign Pink Sheets companies don't have to meet U.S.
disclosure rules by making periodic, detailed financial
reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. All they
must provide is the data they supply regulators in their home
countries.
   The NASD's competitors aren't thrilled. Kenneth Leibler,
president of the American Stock Exchange, says the Bulletin
Board will give foreign stocks the legitimacy of Nasdaq even
though they don't meet Nasdaq's standards. Not only does this
situation pose risks for small investors, he says, but it's
unfair to the exchanges which, like Nasdaq, can trade only
foreign securities that meet U.S. disclosure rules.
   In a compromise proposed by the NASD and accepted by the
SEC, prices of foreign stocks are updated only twice a day,
between 9 and 9:30 a.m. EDT and between 12 and 12:30 p.m.
EDT. The prices aren't firm, only indicated. Traders must
still call one another to get current prices. Even so, the
Amex's Mr. Leibler contends the new system will provide "a
level of stature and visibility that exceeds what should be
allowed for unregistered foreign securities."
   On the plus side, the Bulletin Board will make it tougher
for brokers to give investors widely varying quotes for
foreign stocks, says Thomas McIntyre, vice president of the
$30-million Dessauer Asset Management portfolio of
international stocks, Orleans, Mass.
   "Anything that makes it easier for investors to track
these things and punch up a quote and feel like it's a
representative quote will be better," he says. "It removes
{the trading of foreign issues} out of the black box category
and puts it onto the screen category."
   One of the biggest U.S.-based traders of foreign stocks
agrees. "It helps our client base see the markets," says
Michael Dritz, president and chief executive officer of Smith
New Court, Carl Marks Inc., whose clients include hundreds of
regional and other market makers and large institutions. He
says that in the first week, Smith New Court indicated prices
on the Bulletin Board in about 80 of the 300 foreign issues
it routinely trades. Those included Nestle, Volkswagen,
Deutsche Bank, Britain's Racal Electronics, Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai Banking and Canada's Hemlo Gold Mines.
   There are some "bugs" in the system, he says: Many clients
still don't understand that prices aren't up-to-the minute.
The first half-hour of the morning, already busy with the
opening of the U.S. markets, allows scant time to update
prices. But Smith New Court expects to keep adding more
quotes to the system.
   Investors still face a battle to determine the soundness
of foreign OTC companies that don't meet U.S. disclosure
rules. The information on file in home countries can be slim.
"There's tremendous resistance in Europe" to higher
disclosure standards, Wisconsin's Mr. White says. He adds
that insider trading and market manipulation are common in
some Asian markets. Differences in foreign accounting
practices, difficulties in currency translations and clearing
costs can add up to more headaches, Mr. White says.
   Furthermore, many of the more than 1,700 foreign issues
now listed on the Pink Sheets are obscure and rarely traded.
"If a stock is trading infrequently, you're stuck with it,"
he says. "You certainly won't have the ability to get in and
out at a reasonable price."
   Nonetheless, the NASD's Mr. Wall says he's convinced the
OTC Bulletin Board is providing investors in foreign
securities with more, not less, protection. "This market
existed before June 1," he notes. "We're just providing more
information, and we think that provides an additional
regulatory apparatus." At least now the regulators can keep a
closer eye on trading of the securities.
                                                                                                       

   COLORADO REFORMS: Gov. Roy Romer signed a bill Friday
designed to crack down on securities violations in Colorado,
which regulators say has been a haven for penny-stock fraud.
The new legislation requires all offerings to be registered
with the state; establishes licensing requirements for all
broker-dealers and sales agents and beefs up state
enforcement powers. It also requires all funds raised in
"blank check`" offerings to remain in escrow until a business
plan is adopted and the state securities commissioner is
notified. Colorado Securities Commissioner Philip Feigin
said, "A change was necessary to restore investor confidence
in Colorado offerings."

   Contrast Between Strength in RJR's Warrants
   And Weakness in Its Junk Bonds Puzzles Some

   NEW YORK -- Just 16 months after RJR Nabisco Inc. went
private in a record-setting leveraged buy-out, a sliver of
the tobacco and food company's equity is trading once again
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Analysts are gawking at the result.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The equity, in the form of RJR warrants, has soared 45%
from its value at the time of the 1989 buy-out. The RJR
warrants made their debut on the Big Board Friday, after
having traded sporadically over the counter. They finished
Friday at 7 1/4 on brisk volume, up from a value of about 5
at the time of the buy-out.
   The boom in RJR warrants contrasts with the shabby
performance of RJR's junk bonds in the past year. Some of
those high-yield bonds have sunk as low as 69 cents on the
dollar, amid worries about RJR's ability to handle certain
intricacies of its debt load next year.
   "Something's odd," says Ray Garea, an analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. "You wouldn't think this could
happen."
   If RJR has debt troubles as severe as its sagging bond
prices imply, traditional analysis dictates that the warrants
should be nearly worthless. That's because bondholders should
have first claim on a company's assets. On the other hand, if
RJR is faring as well as its warrant price suggests, why are
the bonds doing so badly?
   Perhaps the financial markets have just gone haywire, Mr.
Garea suggests, and soon will snap to their senses. "Either
the bonds are a screaming buy," he says, "or the warrants are
a screaming short-(sale candidate.)" (In a short sale, an
investor sells borrowed securities, hoping the price will
fall and that he can buy them back later for less.)
   Some savvy investors draw different lessons. They observe
that the public markets are so glutted with RJR junk bonds --
and so starved of RJR equity -- that investors may chase
after the warrants more avidly than the bonds for some time
to come. They think RJR's equity investors may prosper even
if bondholders don't fare so well.
   In financing its buy-out, RJR flooded the junk-bond market
with $12.2 billion of junk bonds. "RJR is my No. 1 holding,"
says Gerald Unterman of Cypress Capital Management, a typical
situation for a junk-bond manager. He's bullish about RJR's
outlook, arguing that a surge in the past year's operating
earnings improves its ability to pay debt. But he has largely
exhausted his buying limit for that single issuer.
   By contrast, a mere $300 million of RJR warrants are
outstanding. For a token exercise price of seven cents each,
these warrants eventually will convert into RJR common stock,
most of which currently is held by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
and its investment partnerships. If all the warrants are
exercised when they expire in 10 years, the warrants will
translate into 9% ownership of RJR. The warrants were issued
in February 1989 as a "sweetener" to attract big junk-bond
buyers to RJR bonds. Starting last month, it has been
possible to separate the warrants from the junk bonds and
trade them separately. That's how the warrants came to be
listed on the Big Board.
   In a recent report, Salomon Brothers analyst Diana Temple
argues that the warrants are worth $8 to $13 each. Ms. Temple
bases her view on some optimistic forecasts of RJR's
operating earnings in the next few years, and of what sort of
multiple those earnings could command. Still, her analysis
underscores a crucial financial point: If the RJR buy-out
succeeds, there isn't any upward limit on equity holders'
return. The best that most bondholders can hope for is that
their securities will make it back to par, or face value.
   The big risk for investors in any RJR security involves
how KKR will handle its obligations concerning two classes of
junk bonds totaling $6 billion. KKR has promised to reset
interest rates on these bonds next April so that the bonds
trade at par. That could be a painful process. These bonds
don't pay cash interest; for the next four to eight years,
they merely pay interest in the form of more bonds, something
investors don't like.
   One of the issues, the 14.07% exchange debentures of 2007,
currently trades at 69 cents on the dollar, with an effective
current yield of 20.3%. Resetting the yield to anything near
20% could eventually chew up all of RJR's cash flow and
imperil the company's survival. As Wall Street speculates
about how KKR will handle the "reset" problem, some people
see ways that bondholders mightn't get 100 cents on the
dollar for a long time, if ever, while the warrant holders
could still thrive. Among areas of speculation: KKR could buy
in some bonds at a discount to their face value, albeit at a
premium to their current market price.
   Bondholders might not protest too much. "We have a
covenant that says the company has to sit down with two
investment banks and reset these bonds so they trade at par,"
says Cypress's Mr. Unterman. Even so, when asked if he would
sell his most-depressed RJR bonds for 80 cents on the dollar,
Mr. Unterman hesitated before insisting he wouldn't.
   Meanwhile, RJR warrants are catching the eyes of brokerage
firms, which are much more comfortable recommending equities
to clients than junk bonds. KKR -- which hasn't had much luck
lately in convincing Wall Street of the appeal of RJR junk
bonds -- has been peppered with brokers' inquiries about the
warrants in the past week or two. Market bears worry that the
warrants might be overpriced at $7.25 each. Yet when there
have been big profits to be made from leveraged investing,
it's generally the people who owned the equity, not the junk
bonds, who got rich.

   A federal judge in San Francisco denied a request by
Nintendo of America Inc. for a temporary restraining order
that would have kept Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. from selling a
video-game device.
   Nintendo sought to stop Galoob from distributing its "Game
Genie," a gadget that makes Nintendo games easier to play.
Nintendo of America, a unit of Japan's Nintendo Co., filed a
lawsuit against the South San Francisco company June 1,
alleging that the Game Genie lets consumers infringe on
Nintendo copyrights by altering Nintendo games.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition to filing for the temporary restraining order,
Nintendo had sought an injunction. While denying the request
for the restraining order, the judge scheduled a formal
hearing for June 29 on Nintendo's request for a preliminary
injunction.
   "We believe very strongly that we don't infringe on
anyone's rights," said Steven Klein, Galoob executive vice
president.
   Lynn Hvalsoe, Nintendo general counsel said the company
achieved its objectives. "We went to court to get a hearing
date . . . and we got it."

   MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Public Service of New Hampshire said
it had a loss of $24 million in one of its three pension plan
investment portfolios during the last two years.
   The utility company said it will have to pay more into the
fund in future years to keep up the asset level. The company
also said that if no recoveries are made, the annual pension
expense will increase by about $1 million annually, from $8.5
million. This increase would not affect customers' bills, the
company added.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The losses have been offset by gains in Public Service's
other pension portfolios; the overall pension plan has assets
of about $100 million, the company said.
   Public Service said its pension plan's assets are
sufficient to fund all of its obligations to its employees
and retirees.
   Public Service has initiated a review of its investments
that resulted in the losses, and the company will determine
whether any additional remedies are available to recover
them.

   SEC Urges Firms
   To Broaden Venues
   For Arbitration

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
</GV>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Small investors could soon have more elbow
room in bringing arbitration cases against their brokers.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is quietly prodding
Wall Street to give investors the option of bringing disputes
with brokers to independent arbitration forums -- rather than
just to arbitration panels sponsored by the exchanges
themselves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a letter to top Wall Street executives, the SEC is
urging the securities industry to adopt a rule giving
investors the choice of resolving their arbitration disputes
at "a reputable forum that is unrelated to the industry."
   The issue goes to the heart of a hot topic in securities
arbitration. The SEC says that giving customers such
flexibility would allay concerns that arbitration stacks the
deck against small investors. Securities executives have long
denied that the industry's arbitration panels are unfair.
   "Customers won't feel they're being tied to an
industry-sponsored forum," says Richard Ryder, editor of the
Securities Arbitration Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J.,
newsletter.
   Investors typically sign a standard agreement when they
open a brokerage account that binds them to accept
arbitration in case of a dispute, rather than filing a
lawsuit.
   And many customers are required by the agreements to take
their cases to industry-subsidized forums. Most go to
arbitration panels sponsored by the National Association of
Securities Dealers or the New York Stock Exchange.
   The major independent forum, the American Arbitration
Association, is privately funded and widely perceived to be
the most sympathetic to investors. (Investors win about 60%
of the time at the AAA, compared with about 50% at
exchange-sponsored forums, arbitration specialists say.)
   The trouble is, the AAA is more expensive. And that,
coupled with brokers' perception that they don't fare as well
at the AAA, is why most securities firms oppose giving
investors the freedom to take disputes there. Moreover, AAA
arbitrators often have less securities experience than those
at exchange-sponsored forums, Wall Streeters argue, thus
lengthening cases. AAA arbitrators, not surprisingly, dismiss
those concerns.
   The controversy has sparked litigation. Last month, the
influential U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York
effectively closed the so-called Amex Window, which affected
investors with brokerage agreements involving the American
Stock Exchange. This "window" allowed investors to go to the
American Arbitration Association if their brokerage contract
didn't bind them specifically to the Amex's own arbitration
panel.
   To keep the window shut, the Amex has asked for SEC
approval to amend its constitution by allowing investors to
go to the AAA only if their contract doesn't specify any
exchange-sponsored forum.
   The recent SEC letter comes as securities firms study a
broader plan to establish a single arbitration forum to
resolve customer complaints. But the commission meantime
wants the industry to address the "significant imbalance" in
the arbitration caseload, according to the letter, which was
signed by the SEC's director of market regulation, Richard G.
Ketchum, and dated May 10. Steering cases to independent
arbitration forums would help the caseload imbalance.
   NASD and Big Board panels together handle 92% of all
arbitration cases, and often hear disputes involving trades
that occurred on other exchanges. For example, 30% of a
recent list of arbitration cases published by the Securities
Arbitration Commentator involved options -- even though these
products aren't widely traded on either the Big Board or
over-the-counter market, which is regulated by the NASD.
   The SEC wants securities executives to respond to the
letter by July 1; even if the industry were to give investors
the flexibility to go to the AAA, any new rule would be at
least many months away.
   This isn't the first time the SEC has tried to push Wall
Street to be more flexible. In 1987, the commission
recommended that brokerage firms include the AAA as an
available arbitration forum in their brokerage agreements.
But the SEC never before had asked for a uniform rule.
   But most firms still balk. One exception is A.G. Edwards &amp;
Sons Inc., which gives investors the choice of using the AAA
because it says it finds no substantial difference among
arbitration panels.
   "We're not afraid of arbitration," says David Mesker, a
senior vice president at A.G. Edwards. "The only thing we
want is someone on the panel who is familiar with the
business."

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Donald Trump has reached a tentative agreement
with his major bankers that would give him time and money to
restructure his troubled real estate and casino empire.
   Under a proposal agreed to over the weekend, the banks
would lend Mr. Trump about $50 million and allow him to
suspend interest payments on about $2 billion in existing
bank loans, according to people familiar with the talks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In return, Mr. Trump has pledged some of the remaining
assets that aren't already 100% collateralized. These
properties are believed to include the Trump Plaza Hotel in
Atlantic City, N.J., and the Trump Tower retail and office
space here. In the event of an asset sale, the banks would
get paid only after existing lenders receive their money for
loans on those properties.
   Mr. Trump is also believed to have forfeited equity in
other properties in return for the suspension of interest
payments.
   Also under discussion was a bank proposal for Mr. Trump to
secure the loan with his father Fred Trump's Brooklyn and
Queens apartment portfolio. That proposal was spurned by Mr.
Trump, however.
   The plan's first hurdle will be confronted today when his
biggest creditors, units of Bankers Trust New York Corp.,
Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover
Corp., are scheduled to meet with about 10 smaller creditors
to discuss the proposal. These 10 banks include Japanese
banks that are believed to have purchased portions of Mr.
Trump's loans through syndications. They are also believed to
include New Jersey banks such as Midlantic National Bank that
have loaned Mr. Trump money for his New Jersey properties.
   "If any one of the other banks do not go along, then the
deal does not work," said a banker involved in the
discussions.
   It is believed that the major banks' contributions toward
the $50 million will be in proportion to the amount they have
lent to Mr. Trump, with Citicorp first, followed by Bankers
Trust, Chase and Manufacturers Hanover.
   The banks declined to comment officially, as did Mr.
Trump, through a spokesman. Officials of Midlantic, a unit of
Midlantic Banks Inc., couldn't be reached.
   If Mr. Trump's smaller creditors give the plan the green
light this week, it appears likely that he will meet a
crucial interest payment on his Trump's Castle casino bonds
Friday. The banks were said to be concerned that if he were
to miss the payment, the New Jersey gambling licenses for all
three of his casinos would be endangered. No banker would
confirm or deny that the payment would be made, however.
   The agreement comes after two weeks of round-the-clock
discussions between the banks, Mr. Trump and his adviser,
Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. Mr. Trump approached the banks after
it became clear that New York City's real-estate slump
coupled with a downturn in the Atlantic City gambling market
would make it difficult for him to make his interest payments
this year.
   Adding to Mr. Trump's difficulties has been a series of
recent purchases, such as the Plaza Hotel and the Trump
Shuttle airline, which have been money-losers so far.
   If the smaller creditors agree to the plan, it will give
Mr. Trump much-needed breathing room to improve his
operations and wait out New York City's real-estate slump.
The idea of the plan, say bankers who participated in the
talks, is to give Mr. Trump enough time to work his problems
out so he won't be forced to sell his major assets at
fire-sale prices.
   "We want the bottom-fishers to go away," said one
participant in the talks. "There's value in the assets, but
now might not be the best time to sell them."
   The value of the Plaza Hotel and a 72-acre parcel of
vacant land on Manhattan's Upper West Side could soar if the
real-estate market improves, the banker said.
   The banks' decision to advance Mr. Trump more funds was
based both on their faith in his ability to manage his way
out of his troubles and their fear that if they squeezed him
too hard, he would seek protection in bankruptcy court, said
people familiar with the negotiations.
   As part of the plan, the banks also want Mr. Trump to make
changes in his glitzy lifestyle and in his management style.
One banker who participated in the talks said he was
impressed that Mr. Trump understood the seriousness of the
situation and appeared willing to make such changes.
   "Many entrepreneurs faced with the same downturn in their
business don't recognize what they have to do," the banker
said.

   International -- Washington Insight:
   West Works to Ease Moscow's Concerns
   As It Sets Terms For East Europe Retreat

   WASHINGTON -- The nature of the deal the West plans to
give Moscow to cover its retreat from Eastern Europe is
finally becoming clear. But whether it will satisfy Mikhail
Gorbachev isn't certain.
   During a summit meeting that featured confrontation over
Europe's future, and again in meetings in Denmark and
Scotland, the West made a strong sales pitch, offering the
Soviet president a tradeoff during the next six months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The West's terms are stark. The Soviets have lost Eastern
Europe and their foothold in Germany, so they must agree to
an arms treaty sealing the Red Army's retreat from Eastern
Europe and destroying thousands of its weapons. They will
have to swallow the absorption of East Germany by West
Germany, and the full membership of the resulting united
Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They will
also have to set a timetable for pulling 380,000 troops out
of former East Germany.
   In return, the West is promising three things. First, it
will help ease Soviet fears by agreeing to shrink German
armed forces over time, to keep Germany from building nuclear
or chemical weapons, and to stress NATO's political role,
rather than its military arms.
   Second, it will help bankroll Soviet demilitarization and
economic reform, through potentially huge economic aid from
Germany.
   Finally, it will help Mr. Gorbachev feel involved and
wanted in Europe by finding some permanent conference table
on European matters at which he can have a seat -- probably a
more formal version of the 35-nation floating Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   "The states of Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union all want to feel that they are part of a European
structure, part of a European architecture," says Secretary
of State James Baker.
   Another senior U.S. official who traveled with Mr. Baker
to last week's NATO meeting in Europe says the U.S. wants to
ensure "that the Soviet Union should be part of the process
of managing change," rather than a sullen -- and dangerous --
spectator.
   But Mikhail Gorbachev knows that except for the German
economic aid, the West's package is largely cosmetic. Strip
away the niceties, and George Bush's vision of the future of
Europe still rests on two alliances from which the U.S.S.R.
is excluded: NATO, whose mutual defense system would remain;
and the European Community, which is moving toward an
integrated market and a close new relationship with the U.S.
   Mr. Gorbachev will be working hard for a better bargain
before December's CSCE summit meeting, at which all this is
supposed to be wrapped up.
   We are likely to hear more of the warning he says he
delivered to Mr. Bush at the summit: "If we in the Soviet
Union feel that we are being squeezed out, that . . .
pressure is being applied on us for a unilateral advantage of
the other side, well . . . that is something that does more
than just . . . cause concern."
   Already, the West's offer has grown beyond the "nine
points" offered by Mr. Bush at the summit. Mr. Baker, an
expert at compromise, has seized upon a vague Soviet idea for
direct NATO-Warsaw Pact talks, making it in effect a 10th
piece of the fig-leaf package.
   "Jim Baker won't care if there are 15 things on the list,
as long as they just provide cover for Gorbachev," says an
administration official. One added item being discussed is
whether to let Soviet and East European officials attend
certain NATO political meetings as observers. Another
possibility involves using German construction companies to
build new housing inside the U.S.S.R. for returning Soviet
troops.
   As the bargaining goes on, there are two main dangers for
U.S. interests. One is that German officials will be so eager
for a deal they will press Mr. Bush to weaken NATO too much,
going beyond a shift in emphasis to gut its military core.
Various German politicians are already talking about getting
all foreign troops out.
   A second danger stems from uncertainty in Moscow. It isn't
clear whether Mr. Gorbachev will retain full authority over
Soviet foreign policy in his struggle for power with the
republics led by Russia's Boris Yeltsin. Even if he does,
some Soviet officials say there is a fierce internal debate
among his foreign policy advisers about how easily to settle
with the West -- and especially whether to cut a broad deal
with a West led by the U.S., or a narrow one with Germany
alone. The latter approach might cost Moscow less, but it
would cause Washington more pain.

   Wet Spring
   Raises Fears
   Of Inflation

   Rains Hurt Planting
   In Corn Belt; Higher
   Food Prices Are Seen

   CHICAGO -- The old adage is, "Rain makes grain." But this
spring, rain is just making mud.
   The wettest spring in about 50 years in much of the
Midwest has prevented so much planting that some economists
are beginning to fear it will worsen inflation in food
prices. Farm chemical companies, already under pressure from
environmental groups, are seeing lower-than-expected sales of
pesticides and fertilizer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   More than twice the normal amount of rain has fallen in
several Corn Belt states. Many corn farmers weren't able to
complete working in their fields before the start of this
month, generally considered the deadline for giving the crop
enough time to go through its delicate pollination stage
before the peak summer heat begins.
   The rainfall has been heaviest in a crescent-shaped area
that includes southern Indiana, southern Illinois and
Missouri. In Boonville, Ind., Frederick Rauth has been unable
to plant any of his 80 acres in corn. "This has been one of
the wettest springs I can remember," he says. "We can't get
any luck."
   As a result, grain traders are beginning to scrap their
month-old estimates that corn farmers would plant 6% more
acres than last year and that corn production would hit a
four-year high of around 8.1 billion bushels.
   Such a bumper harvest would have begun replenishing
stockpiles that were halved by the 1988 drought. It also
would have eased pressure on food prices, which last year
rose 5.8% for their biggest jump since 1981.
   The corn harvest has more impact on grocery prices than
does any other crop. Corn is used in more food products and
accounts for a large portion of the cost of producing beef,
pork and poultry. Some economists had been assuming that a
large harvest would force corn prices slightly lower this
year. But the price of a bushel of corn is already 12% above
a year ago in some areas.
   While the rain is reviving ground exhausted by the
drought, and could help boost yields on land that did get
planted, many analysts now are estimating that corn farmers
planted only about the same as last year's 72.3 million
acres. As a result, some analysts are trimming their harvest
estimates by as much as 9%.
   This prospect of a smaller-than-expected corn harvest
comes at a time of near-record prices for red meat. Hog
prices have soared nearly 40% in the past year, in part
because of rising exports to Japan and stiff competition
among meatpackers for a tight supply of fattened hogs. The
price of a pork belly used to make bacon has more than
doubled. Retail beef prices have been bouncing around record
levels for several months because the cattle herd is the
smallest since 1961.
   Citing these high meat prices, Paul Prentice, an economist
at Farm Sector Economics Associates, said he is raising his
estimate of 1990 food and beverage price inflation to 6.1%
from 5.9%.
   Most economists will wait until July to determine whether
the potential corn crop is significantly lower than
originally thought, and how that would change their inflation
forecasts. Favorable summer weather compensated for
rain-delayed planting several times in the early 1980s. "We
want to wait and see what happens," said Raymond Daniel, an
economist at WEFA Group, Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "We could still see
record corn yields."
   Some crop analysts, however, are already saying that even
a normal July heat wave could push up the price of the corn
futures contract for July delivery by 5%, to $3 a bushel.
   What's more, some meteorologists think that the odds don't
favor benign weather. Based on historical patterns, the
chances of a dry July or August are better than even, said
Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of Weather Services
Corp., Bedford, Mass.
   For farmers, the poor planting weather is a mixed bag. In
wet states such as Indiana and Illinois, many farmers have
little choice but to sow soybeans on their unplanted acreage.
Although the soybean is a hardier plant than corn, it is less
profitable to grow.
   "This weather is really messing me up," said Paul
Kleinknecht, an Evansville, Ind., farmer who was only able to
sow corn on 80 of the 500 acres he wanted to plant. "I don't
know how much I'll be able to get for beans, but I have to go
on with it just the same."
   On the western edge of the Corn Belt, however, the weather
has been drier. Farmers in parts of South Dakota and Nebraska
got much of their corn planted on schedule and might reap a
windfall if crop prices rise until the harvest.
   "Things are going to start popping soon around here," says
Barney Roling of Salem, S.D., who planted 650 acres of corn
on time.
   The wet weather also has depressed sales for many farm
suppliers. Max Fordyce, owner of Fordyce Feed and Supply in
Ridgeway, Mo., says the poor planting season has cost him
more than $350,000 in sales of fertilizer, seed and
pesticides.
   "It's terrible," he says. "Here it is June and we don't
have a single patch of excellent-looking corn in the county.
The rain has probably cost farmers around here 20% in
acreage, which means more than 20% in lost sales for us."
   Nationwide, the weather is a drag on farm chemical sales,
because corn farmers are the biggest consumers of fertilizer
and pesticides. Before the spring, pesticide industry
officials expected unit sales volume to increase 2% this
season. Now, volume is expected to be about flat compared
with last year.
   Fertilizer manufacturers might be particularly hard hit.
Corn farmers already have been reducing their per-acre usage
of fertilizer as application technology has grown more
sophisticated and environmental concerns have increased. Corn
farmers reduced their application rate by 8% last year, and
some industry analysts expect another decline this spring.
   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   It could be a nervous time for world oil markets as
traders look to see whether recent sharp declines in crude
and product prices accelerate, or reverse course as they
already have done once this year.
   A petroleum glut has depressed prices in recent weeks,
with crude traded for July delivery on the New York
Mercantile Exchange ending the week at $16.78 a barrel, up 11
cents on the day but off more than 80 cents for the week.
Market participants have viewed production cuts by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries as insufficient
to reduce the oversupply.
   OPEC recently agreed to reduce its output by nearly 1.5
million barrels a day, though its officials felt that
production cuts of around one million barrels would be enough
to satisfy oil markets. But so far, it appears OPEC hasn't
reached that threshold. Any news this week on OPEC's
production level could have a quick impact on prices. In
addition, traders say the market has been so jittery that
even minor news could drive prices.
                                                                                                       

   Cocoa
                                                                                                       

   Cocoa prices, which emerged from a prolonged slump with a
sharp rally recently, may be heading down again. The July
contract dropped $76 a metric ton Friday, the sharpest
one-day decline since a $78 drop last September, to settle at
$1,235.
   A settlement in the eight-day Brazilian dock strike
apparently played a part in the sell-off, although the
walkout wasn't a factor in the recent price advances.
   "Cocoa prices were overinflated by the political upheavals
in the past month in the Ivory Coast, even though it
eventually became evident that they didn't directly affect
the cocoa market," said Judith Ganes, analyst for Merrill
Lynch, New York.
   "However," she said, "the Brazilian dock strike, which may
have delayed some cocoa shipments, generally tended more to
keep the sellers from becoming aggressive." When that
restraint was lifted with the relatively quick settlement of
the strike, active selling quickly drove down prices, she
said.
   The Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer;
Brazil also is a major grower.
                                                                                                       

   Sugar
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices fell Friday despite several sizable
purchases on a tight world market, but prices may show a
delayed reaction this week and recover, analysts said.
   According to analysts and a New York dealer, Chile bought
90,000 tons of sugar; Turkey is seeking to buy 100,000 tons;
and Mexico bought 100,000 tons and is trying to buy 50,000 to
75,000 tons more.
   The July futures contract, nevertheless, eased 0.12 cent a
pound to 13.42 cents. One analyst admitted surprise. "I don't
understand why futures declined," he said Friday. "When you
consider how tight supplies are, the quantity of sugar that
was bought should have had a price-supporting impact. I have
to believe that sometime next week, traders will wake up and
properly react to what has taken place."
   Another analyst, Stephen Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds in
Chicago, said, "The world market purchases of sugar were
impressive, and the futures market's downward reaction to
them was disappointing, particularly the liquidation late in
the day."
   Whatever the reason for sellers' aggressiveness, Mr. Platt
said, there could be a change of attitude this week.

   The companies said the new exchange ratio depends on the
price of Medtronic stock staying between $77.50 and $92. In
New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, however,
Medtronic shares closed at $76.25, down $3.375. In national
over-the-counter trading, Bio-Medicus shares closed at
$23.75, up 62.5 cents.
   The final exchange ratio will be based on the closing
price 10 days before the effective date, which is projected
to be 75 to 120 days from now.

   HIGH-TECH homing devices that help recover stolen cars are
flocking to the market. But consumers might want to hold back
while the nascent industry dukes it out.
   LoJack Corp. of Needham, Mass., sells a system that gives
off a radio signal that can be tracked by police cars
equipped with LoJack receivers. The transmitter, hidden in
the car, is activated by remote control after the owner
reports the vehicle missing. The company, which has sold the
device in Massachusetts since 1986 and has expansion plans,
says 95% of the 1,100 LoJack-equipped stolen cars have been
recovered.
   But a competitor, Code-Alarm Inc. of Michigan, faults
LoJack. Peter Stouffer, vice president of Code-Alarm, snipes
that with LoJack, "when you get back from your trip to
Hawaii, you call." In contrast, he says, Code-Alarm's
"Intercept" system, due for launch in Michigan this month,
will flash tracking signals the moment the car alarm is
tampered with or the ignition is bypassed.
   Meanwhile, Mets Inc. of Indianapolis is launching a system
that uses receivers mounted on a series of towers to zero in
on transmitted signals. James Walker, Mets' executive vice
president, says his company's system is better because it
doesn't depend on police to act as trackers, and can be
adapted to send signals to tow trucks. In Los Angeles,
International Teletrac Systems says it will begin offering a
locator service similar to the Mets system later this year.
   The lack of a standard could thwart the effectiveness of
the systems. "You could steal a LoJack vehicle, and go past a
state police officer {whose agency monitors another system}
and nothing would happen," says Kenneth MacKenzie, a
Richardson, Texas, police detective.
   The LoJack and Mets systems start at about $600, but Mets
will also charge a $10 to $15 monthly fee. Code-Alarm's
device is part of a $1,499 alarm-cellular phone system that
also packs a monthly fee. But Code-Alarm's Mr. Stouffer says
that as technology matures and competition grows, "prices
will drop by half."
                                                                                                       

   With the Power to Sell,
   Survey Pitches a Pitch
                                                                                                       

   IF YOU'VE GOT it, flaunt it.
   J.D. Power &amp; Associates, the California market research
firm whose annual quality survey sways many a new-car buyer,
is looking to capitalize on its success. This year, for the
first time, J.D. Power is offering companies whose cars
ranked in the top 10 on its quality study the chance to buy a
customized video that dealers can show to shoppers to give
them "an independent, third-party perspective."
   Power is urging makers of top-ranked cars to buy copies of
the videos, which will cost in the area of $50 to $100, and
send them to all dealers. Power isn't publicly saying which
cars are on the list, but says the results were set before
the video marketing began.
   The videos won't say which rank each car earned. But
consumers can rest assured that the company whose car is
named No. 1 will broadcast the fact. After Power dubbed the
Buick LeSabre the top quality U.S.-made car last June, sales
of the model jumped nearly 33% that month and 91% the next.
   Power wanted to keep the study under wraps until July 3 to
give winners time to develop advertising around the results.
But the Detroit News and Free Press spilled the beans
Saturday: Toyota Motor Corp.'s Cressida was the top model;
its Lexus luxury division the No. 1 brand. Buick's LeSabre
was the only Big Three car in the top 10.
                                                                                                       

   `Affordability Index'
   Confirms Racing Prices
                                                                                                       

   DOES IT SEEM that car payments take a bigger bite out of
the monthly budget than a few years ago? David G. Sowerby, an
economist at Detroit's Manufacturers Bank, says it's no
illusion.
   Since 1972, the cost of buying and financing a new car has
gone up faster than the median family income, and Mr. Sowerby
and Manufacturers have developed an "Auto Affordability
Index" to illustrate the imbalance.
   The index is based on 1972, when the cost of the average
new car, including finance charges, was $4,464, or about 40%
of the median family income of $11,126. The Auto
Affordability Index for 1972 was 100. By 1989, the total cost
of the average new car had more than quadrupled to $19,198,
in part because of the cost of safety and pollution-control
equipment. But median income had risen only to $32,487, not
even a tripling. Result: The affordability index plummeted to
67.9.
   Car makers contend that the index doesn't recognize that
consumers are choosing higher-end cars, and getting more car
for the money than 18 years ago.
   But that argument sidesteps the fact that the car market
is stagnating, says David L. Littman, a senior economist for
Manufacturer's Bank. "There are a lot more potential buyers
out there {than in 1972}, yet the market hasn't hit any new
highs," he says. "Much of that has to be laid at the doorstep
of affordability."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   UNDER PRESSURE from New York state, Ford Motor Co. is
dropping a longstanding policy that allowed Ford and
Lincoln-Mercury dealers to refuse to provide warranty repairs
for Ford vehicles they didn't sell. As of Sept. 1, all Ford
dealers nationwide will be required to do warranty work on
any Ford vehicle. New York officials charged that some Ford
salespeople in New York were telling buyers they could get
their cars fixed at another dealership, while service
managers were refusing to take in cars purchased elsewhere. .
. . What do motorists fear the most: Brake failure, according
to a survey by the Allied-Signal Inc. unit that markets
Bendix brakes. So how many of the same car owners say brakes
should be checked regularly? Just 19.6%.

   LOS ANGELES -- A federal jury convicted David Arnold
Feldman, 50 years old, of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., of
defrauding financial institutions, including BankAmerica
Corp., of about $144 million in a mortgage investment scheme.
   Mr. Feldman was convicted on three counts of mail fraud,
but was acquitted of two other counts. He faces as long as 15
years in prison. Sentencing by Judge Dickran Tevrizian is
scheduled for Aug. 20.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Two other principal figures in the mortgage fraud pleaded
guilty earlier this year to reduced charges of mail fraud in
the case. They are Ken Borden Rogers, 50, of Huntington
Beach, and George Charles Ash Jr., 45, of Alta Loma. The
three were indicted last year for scheming to sell what
proved to be practically worthless mortgage loans to 20 banks
and savings and loan associations outside California.
   The men had promised high interest rates and had assured
investors that their investments were protected by
independent underwriting policies, among other safeguards.
   Most of the loans later went into default, and Bank of
America, as the trustee for most of the mortgage securities
pools, repurchased them and took a total of $95 million in
charges against the 1984 earnings of its parent, BankAmerica
Corp.
   When the three men were indicted by a federal grand jury
last year, prosecutors called the case one of the largest
single frauds ever perpetrated in the savings and loan
business.
   Mr. Feldman had been free on bond but was ordered returned
to custody to await sentencing.

   Budget Summits: The Pits for Presidents

EXECUTIVE (EXE)

<LP>
   With the "easy" Gorbachev summit past him, President Bush
now returns to the work of the less glamorous budget summit.
By committing himself to this process, the president pulled
the congressional leadership's fat out of the fire. His
efforts are not likely to be rewarded.
   Recent experience and academic literature demonstrate that
presidents will tend to restrain the growth of government,
while Congress will tend to expand it. Moreover, Republicans
will tend to dominate the presidency, while Democrats will
tend to dominate Congress. Both presidents and Congress are
perfectly willing to engage in deficit finance. But when the
deficit gets too large, presidents are likely to deal with it
by restraining spending, while Congress is likely to prefer a
tax increase. Of the two, restraining spending is more
effective in reducing the deficit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Had President Bush not agreed to a summit, he could have
held the line on taxes quite easily. Congress was unlikely to
pass a tax increase without his acquiescence, and even if it
did, the president could have vetoed the bill and been
sustained. Moreover, he would still have gained a substantial
deficit reduction. Under Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, the projected
deficit must be no more than $74 billion or else
across-the-board cuts (a sequester) must be administered to
reduce the projected deficit to $64 billion. And, given
congressional demands for a "peace dividend," President Bush
would likely have gotten a higher number for defense through
the sequester than Congress is likely to give him in any
budget deal.
   Budget summits are also bad for presidents because the
congressional leadership cannot deliver. The days when a
Lyndon Johnson and a Sam Rayburn could drop in on an
Eisenhower and cut a little deal are long past. Although
congressional leaders will negotiate in earnest, the deal
they strike with a president is a mere proposal to be put
before Congress.
   As an illustration, at the conclusion of the 1987 budget
summit, literally as we were pushing our chairs back from the
table, Tom Foley (the group's chairman) looked across the
table at the White House team (Jim Baker, Howard Baker and
me) and said, "Now, you've got to help us get this thing
passed]" This was after 20 arduous days and nights of
negotiating -- half the time that Noah spent on the ark]
While I do not question the integrity of congressional
leadership, there does seem something unwholesome about
congressional invitations to "deal." In commercial law, if
you negotiate to sell something that you cannot deliver, it
is known as fraud.
   A third problem, related to the second, is that a
president has no assurance that Congress will not "undo" the
deal at some future time. For example, the 1987 budget summit
concluded in a two-year agreement for fiscal 1988 and 1989.
According to the agreement, the administration agreed to a
tax increase in exchange for certain budget "cuts" relative
to the current-services baseline. The claim of the group was
that over two years there would be "$76 billion in real
deficit reduction."
   Yet, what really happened? Under the agreement, compared
with OMB's mid-session review baseline, receipts were
supposed to increase over the previous year by $68.6 billion
for 1988 and $69.8 billion for 1989. The actual increases
were $54.9 billion and $81.8 billion, respectively. So,
Congress pretty much got its increased revenue. But what
about the spending cuts? Under the agreement, outlays were
supposed to rise by $3.3 billion in 1988 and $43.6 billion in
1989. Instead, they went up a whopping $60.3 billion and
$78.8 billion, respectively. In short, President Reagan got
taken. So did the American people. Under the agreement, the
deficit should have been $93.1 billion in 1988 and $66.9
billion in 1989. Instead, the deficits were $155.1 billion
and $152.1 billion, respectively.
   The "bottom line" is that in 1987, when President Reagan
held firm against invitations to "deal" and threatened to
veto any tax increase and any appropriations he deemed
excessive, the deficit narrowed by a record $71.5 billion (to
$149.7 billion from $221.2 billion). But when he went along
with demands for a budget summit, we got additional taxes,
spending growth, and no progress on the deficit.
   Of course, it is conceivable that President Bush will be
able to negotiate budget-process reforms (a balanced-budget
amendment, an item-reduction veto, etc.) that would change
incentives sufficiently to solve the basic problem of deficit
finance and excessive spending. Much more likely, however, is
that he will have to settle for promised cuts in spending,
increased taxes (that will materialize and will be spent),
and little progress on the deficit. Soon, Congress will again
find itself in a deadlock and leaders will call upon the
president to bail them out with another budget summit.

   NEW YORK -- American International Group Inc. said it
agreed to acquire Fischbach Corp. through a subsidiary in an
exchange of stock valued at $11 a Fischbach share, or about
$44 million.
   AIG, a New York-based insurer, disclosed last month that
it was considering such a purchase. The company is
responsible for a large portion of the performance bonds for
Fischbach, an electrical and mechanical contracting concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   About $600 million of performance bonds have been issued
to the New York-based contractor. The acquisition is widely
viewed as an effort by AIG to protect itself from potentially
large performance-bond claims.
   In connection with the transaction, AIG said it exercised
an option to acquire, at $11 a share, the 54% stake in
Fischbach held by APL Corp., which is controlled by Miami
financier Victor Posner.
   AIG said APL held a total of 2,068,370 shares of Fischbach
common, as well as about $6.5 million principal amount of
Fischbach convertible subordinated debt.
   In a statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, AIG disclosed that it also formed a business
relationship with Peter Kiewit &amp; Sons Inc., a privately held
construction company based in Omaha, Neb., that is expected
to provide management consulting services to Fischbach.

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- For most of the nine years since President
Reagan appointed Sandra Day O'Connor the first woman Supreme
Court justice, her importance on the court has been more
symbolic than substantive. But now, as the court heads into
the home stretch of its 1989-1990 term, Justice O'Connor has
emerged in a new and quite powerful role as the critical
"swing" vote, determining just how far the court will go in
its most closely watched and divisive cases.
   In the past 18 months, she has cast the deciding vote to
stop the court from overruling the constitutional right to
abortion; to restrict state and local government
affirmative-action programs aimed at helping minority
businesses; to allow states to execute murderers who are
retarded or who were juveniles when their crimes were
committed; and to brake attempts by conservative justices to
pare down much of the wall between church and state in such
areas as prayer in the schools.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Her pivotal role is indicative of how conservative the
court has become. Until he retired in 1987, Justice Lewis
Powell occupied the court's middle, often casting the
deciding vote in close cases. His replacement by Justice
Anthony Kennedy coalesced the conservatives, including Chief
Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Byron White and
Antonin Scalia.
   "As justices more conservative than her have been
appointed, her position has moved to the controlling middle
of the court," says Robert Glennon, a professor at the
University of Arizona Law School. "On a range of issues,
lawyers must pay special heed to making arguments that she
will find persuasive."
   Often, what Justice O'Connor finds persuasive is a
cautious, almost hesitant approach. "Although she is
conservative, she resists doctrinaire and rigid
formulations," says Harvard Law School Prof. Laurence Tribe.
"She's not nearly as tempted as some justices to search for
bright lines. She tries to find manageable, intermediate
principles."
   That sometimes frustrates her more intellectually
venturesome colleagues -- most notably in last year's
historic Webster case. Justice O'Connor voted with the 5-4
majority to uphold Missouri's restrictions on abortion, but
refused to join with the other conservatives to overrule Roe
vs. Wade, the 1973 decision recognizing a right to abortion.
   Court insiders say that Chief Justice Rehnquist, trying to
assemble a majority to scrap the so-called trimester system
of abortion regulation established by Roe (which found a
right to abortion within the first three months of
pregnancy), had written a draft opinion specifically aimed at
securing Justice O'Connor's vote. She, though, remained
secretive and didn't respond for weeks. Her conservative
colleagues, left in the dark, nonetheless hoped she was with
them. Then, just days before the decision was released, she
circulated her own opinion, rebuffing the chief justice's
approach.
   Her opinion prompted a vituperative attack on her by
Justice Scalia. Her position, he wrote in his own opinion,
was irresponsible, "irrational," and not to be "taken
seriously." Court sources say Justice O'Connor was both
"hurt" and "peeved" by Justice Scalia's attack, which went
well beyond the usual bounds of public disagreement among the
justices.
   Today, there doesn't seem to be any lasting chill between
the two conservatives. But one justice observes that, in what
may be an ironic response to the flap, Justice O'Connor this
year has seemed if anything even more cautious about joining
particularly strongly worded opinions.
   Nor is she generally comfortable with opinions that seek
to sow seeds of future legal principles, as opposed to
deciding the issue at hand on more narrow terms. Former
clerks say this is one factor that has made her leery of
opinions written by Justice William Brennan, leader of the
court's liberal wing.
   As the only member of the court to have served as a state
legislator -- she was majority leader of the Arizona Senate
-- Justice O'Connor is more consistently willing to defer to
state laws than are any of her colleagues. "She trusts state
legislatures in a way that I doubt any of the other justices
do," says Arizona's Prof. Glennon. Yet she wrote the majority
opinion last year striking down a Richmond, Va., plan to set
aside a percentage of city contracts for minority businesses,
in the process forcing 36 states and some 200 cities and
counties to revamp or abandon similar efforts.
   She has also joined many of the court's opinions aimed at
restricting the rights of accused criminals and at limiting
the number and duration of death penalty appeals.
   It is on issues of religious freedom that she has done
most to stake out her own ground, urging the court to abandon
a rigid three-part test adopted in 1971 to decide whether
various government activities breach the wall of separation
between church and state. She has argued that the three-part
test, which is still technically in effect although losing
support, promotes government hostility to religion, when the
goal of the First Amendment is neutrality.
   Justice O'Connor's view is that as long as government
bodies aren't seen as endorsing religious activities, their
actions ought to be constitutional. On the other hand, she
doesn't go nearly as far as some of the court's other
conservatives, who would give religious practices even more
leeway.
   "Her religion test is the best effort around," says
Harvard's Prof. Tribe. Last week she gained a majority for
her approach for the first time when the court upheld a 1984
federal law requiring public schools to allow religious clubs
to meet on the same terms as other extracurricular
activities.
   Justice O'Connor has generally been part of a majority to
make it tougher for workers to prove claims of employment
discrimination, and to make it more difficult for employers
to justify affirmative-action plans. But she demonstrates a
bit more flexibility when the issue is sex discrimination.
   Such cases inevitably focus more attention on her because
of her symbolic role. For instance, after a federal appeals
court in Chicago last September upheld corporate
fetal-protection policies barring women of childbearing age
from certain hazardous jobs, Judge Richard Cudahy crafted his
dissent as if speaking directly to Justice O'Connor. "Of the
12 federal judges to have considered this case to date, none
has been female," he wrote. The case, he said, "demands" a
woman's "insight into social reality." The Supreme Court has
agreed to rule on the issue in the term beginning in October.
   Justice O'Connor doesn't talk much about how or whether
being a woman affects her court rulings. But on other
matters, she leaves little doubt that she feels keenly the
importance of being the court's first woman.
   When she addressed a recent centennial celebration of the
Los Angeles-based law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, she
recalled having been offered a job there after her 1952
graduation from Stanford Law School -- as a secretary. She
found it ironic that nearly three decades later, a senior
member of the firm, former Attorney General William French
Smith, was instrumental in picking her for the Supreme Court.
   "I can remember when he telephoned to ask me if I could
come to Washington to talk about a position there," she told
the lawyers at the centennial. "I immediately guessed he was
planning to offer me a secretarial position -- but would it
be as secretary of labor or secretary of commerce?"
   She accepts her symbolic role enthusiastically, meeting
with visiting women judges from other countries and
addressing professional women's groups. She encourages the
handful of women law clerks at the court to join the exercise
class she organized, and every year attends an informal,
private dinner with them. "She was very warm, and hugged
people," said one participant last year.
   Last year, Laura Miller, who clerked for Justice White,
met with Justice O'Connor for some career advice. A short
time later, Ms. Miller's phone rang: It was the justice,
saying that if you're going to be a lawyer, you need to dress
like one. Justice O'Connor collected Ms. Miller, drove her to
the store and helped assemble a wardrobe.
   For her own four clerks, she occasionally organizes
outings to see the cherry blossoms, or for a
champagne-and-chocolate picnic at the National Arboretum. She
drops into the clerks' offices to play "Nerf" basketball or
offer late afternoon popcorn. And those who remained in
Washington last Thanksgiving were invited to her house in
suburban Chevy Chase.
   The clash with Justice Scalia notwithstanding, her
personal relationships with the other eight justices are also
warm. On her 60th birthday in March, for instance, they all
sported large buttons bearing her picture that her law clerks
handed out.
   Off the bench, friends and former law clerks say, the
justice is a study in determination. "Whatever it is, she
will enter into it completely," says Nancy Ignatius, a close
friend and frequent tennis companion. This is the case
whether the activity is dancing with her husband, John, a
lawyer who divides his time between Washington and their home
in Phoenix, or whether it is her twice-weekly tennis games,
where the object is to play and win, not spend a lot of time
warming up or talking. She is that way about friendships, too
-- loyal and determined to remember birthdays, kids' names
and other details.
   Determination is also the byword on the job. Early in
1988, when she had an emergency appendectomy, her law clerks
sent work to the hospital. "She'd call and say send more," a
former clerk says. The day before she underwent breast-cancer
surgery later that year, she was driven some 400 miles
round-trip to Washington &amp; Lee University in Lexington, Va.,
to keep a speaking engagement. Ten days after the surgery she
was back on the bench.
   Now, apparently recovered, she puts in 10-hour days, often
eats lunch at her desk, and takes reading home most nights.
She works most Saturdays as well, often cooking lunch for her
clerks (usually tacos or Southwestern fare). She prepares
intensely for the court's 130 oral arguments each term, and
takes an active role in questioning lawyers from the bench.
   Yet in public, particularly when reporters are present,
she is very reserved, almost painfully so. Although she gives
about a dozen speeches a year, she never announces the
occasions to the media or releases texts. "My first year on
the court made me long at times for obscurity," she said in a
speech a few years ago.
   If obscurity is ever possible for a Supreme Court justice,
though, it is impossible for her now. Particularly on
abortion, her every writing and utterance is examined and
parsed by observers on all sides.
   In the cases she has heard thus far, she has suggested a
new, more lenient way of looking at state and federal
regulations, one that would recognize legitimate government
interests in an unborn fetus while deciding whether the rules
impose an "undue burden" on a pregnant woman.
   So far, she hasn't encountered a law that she felt imposed
an undue burden on pregnant women, although she also hasn't
wanted to go so far as to say there isn't a constitutional
right to abortion. Some legislators, like anti-abortion
leaders in Idaho, are trying to pass a statute aimed
expressly at her "undue burden" test. If and when such a law
reaches her, she will finally be put to the test: strike down
the law, or overturn the right to abortion.
   Meanwhile, the court is due to rule any day on whether
states may require that parents be notified before a minor
has an abortion. And next fall, it will hear arguments on the
validity of Reagan-era rules forbidding federally funded
family-planning clinics to counsel women about abortion. None
of the cases are obvious vehicles for overruling Roe, but
they will provide further clues to her thinking.
   So far, says Bruce Fein, a conservative legal columnist,
"she has been disappointing in the abortion area, not only
because of her clear reluctance to overrule Roe, but because
of a certain timidity in her opinions. She hasn't been
willing to take on the core question of whether there is a
constitutional right to privacy." Nonetheless, he and other
conservatives hope "she'll still get to overruling Roe in a
gradual, sequential progression of cases."
   Abortion-rights advocates, meanwhile, find their hopes
pinned to this most unlikely figure. "My assumption is that
she doesn't want to be the fifth vote to overrule Roe," says
Susan Estrich, a law professor at the University of Southern
California and former Michael Dukakis campaign manager. Ms.
Estrich and Harvard Law School Prof. Kathleen Sullivan
recently wrote a law review article on abortion that put the
situation bluntly. "Eight men may read our briefs," they
wrote, "but the real audience is one woman."

   From Junk Market to Flea Market:

   NEW YORK -- The hallways of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
where some of the biggest financial deals of the 1980s were
conceived, turned into a flea market yesterday.
   Some 2,200 people, many wearing shorts and T-shirts,
poured into Drexel's Broad Street headquarters for the start
of a five-day liquidation sale. As part of Drexel's
bankruptcy-law proceedings, the securities firm is selling
all its desks, computers, kitchen equipment and even its
brass coat racks.

   "This will finally be my chance to do business with
Drexel," dentist David Eidman joked, as he and three friends
strolled through the remnants of Drexel's seventh-floor
corporate finance department. They were looking for a
credenza and some chairs for the waiting room of Mr. Eidman's
dental offices. He and his friends stopped to look at the
choices in a series of half-empty Drexel offices that had
been tagged as Lot No. 216, Lot No. 219 and Lot No. 220 by
the auctioneers.
   The most popular stop for visitors was the 10th floor,
where Drexel's equity-trading department once traded millions
of shares a day. A small overhead sign still blinked out in
red letters: "Welcome to Drexel's block trading desk."
Otherwise, though, any trace of stock trading had vanished.
The entire 200-by-100-foot trading floor had been transformed
into a barnlike display of personal computers, printers and
facsimile machines.
   "We're looking for a cheap computer that our children can
get started on," said a couple pushing a baby stroller.
Across the way, Wallace Jefferson, an escalator repairman
with the New York City Transit Authority, unscrewed the back
of a Compaq computer to check the circuitry. "A lot of this
stuff is broken," Mr. Jefferson warned a passerby.
   Ross-Dove Co., which is handling the auction, said the
sale is one of its largest ever. It covers 10 floors of
Drexel's headquarters and seven other buildings in the New
York area, as well as satellite offices in other cities. A
Ross-Dove spokesman predicted that proceeds will be "in the
seven figures" once bidding starts on Wednesday. Yesterday,
today and tomorrow amount to a preview of the collection.
   Those proceeds won't make a big dent in Drexel's overall
finances, but they should generate a little more money with
which to pay creditors.
   For a few visitors yesterday, the chance to roam Drexel's
offices was high adventure. "Look at all these contacts I've
collected," college student Eric Weinstein said. He
cheerfully admitted that he had been opening desk drawers of
former Drexel securities analysts and picking out any
business cards still left in the desks. "I've got the
investor relations guy at Ralston Purina," Mr. Weinstein
said, pulling out a card halfway through his stack. "That
could come in handy some day."
   More commonly, though, visitors said walking through
Drexel's deserted offices was much more melancholy than they
expected. "This is like an estate sale after a funeral," one
woman said.
   At the entryway to Drexel's plush corporate finance
department, the receptionist's L-shaped desk still harbored a
sign that said: "Will Return. Please Wait." Baby photos and
lottery tickets were tucked next to a phone. Two desk
calendars were left open to Feb. 19, the Monday after Drexel
filed for bankruptcy-law protection.
   "I walk through here and I think about all the secretaries
that got laid off," Ross-Dove security guard Deborah Andrews
said. "If I saw one of those people, I'd hug them and say, `I
know just how you feel.'"
   This week's auction doesn't cover Drexel's renowned
Beverly Hills, Calif., office, where financier Michael Milken
worked. Property from that office has already been sold.
   Still, one New York visitor yesterday found an eerie trace
of one of Mr. Milken's top lieutenants. "You want to hear
something sad?" a middle-aged man asked his wife, as they
walked along a seventh-floor corridor. "Look what I found in
the men's room." He held up a three-inch thick blue book with
Drexel's name printed in gold leaf in the center.
   It was an archive copy of the confidential paperwork
involved in one of 1985's biggest takeovers, the acquisition
of Northwest Industries Inc. by financier William Farley.
Drexel had helped finance the deal. That particular copy of
the Farley papers evidently had belonged to star Drexel
deal-maker Leon Black. His name was printed in gold leaf in
the lower righthand corner.
   "Now it's being used as a doorstop," the visitor said.

   TRUMP'S MAJOR bankers agreed tentatively to lend him $50
million more and to let him suspend interest payments on
about $2 billion of debt. The developer would pledge as
security some of his remaining uncollateralized assets and
would possibly forfeit equity in other holdings. The accord,
which needs the approval of smaller creditors, would give
Trump time to improve his operations and wait out a real

   Old Ad Slogans? Not New] Not Improved]

   Remember "Where's the Beef?" -- the jackpot advertising
slogan Wendy's used in the early 1980s? How about "I Want My
Maypo]" -- the line used in ads more than 15 years ago?
   If you thought those ad themes were dead forever, think
again. They're back.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wendy's, for one, this summer plans to test a commercial
reviving its mega-hyped ad slogan that found its way onto
T-shirts and even became a gimmick Walter Mondale used in his
1984 presidential bid.
   The late Clara Peller, the fast-food chain's crotchety
pitchlady who barked the line at the counters of rival
hamburger chains, made the slogan famous. But Wendy's says
the line is such a barn-burner that it can be made part of a
hit campaign again without her.
   In dusting off a popular ad theme, Wendy's isn't alone.
Many advertisers are making past themes part of their current
marketing efforts. Perrier, for example, just brought back
its "Earth's First Soft Drink" copy line. And Banfi Vintners
this month starts a campaign reviving a slogan that hasn't
been used for five years: "Riunite on Ice. That's Nice."
   Recycling old ad slogans isn't a new idea. Two years ago,
for example, Nestle Foods brought back its "Nestea Plunge"
ads. But revivals seem to come in waves, and ad executives
say Madison Avenue is in the middle of a big one.
   But marketing experts say recycling old advertising is
very often exactly what a company's marketing plan doesn't
need. Some say bringing back an old campaign is a cop-out
that won't offer the kind of fix that stale brands need.
   "Sometimes this can be smart, because the line represents
the real equity in your brand," says Hank Seiden, chairman of
Ketchum Advertising, New York. But he adds: "It's dumb when
you're just lazy and you go back to a theme that might have
had no significance in the first place. Some people revive
ads just for the sake of reviving it -- maybe the chairman
liked it."
   Mr. Seiden's shop, though, is the one behind the revival
of the old Riunite line, which this month will be used to
court college-age kids. And Ketchum's also responsible for
recently bringing back "I Want My Maypo" to promote the hot
breakfast cereal.
   The difference, Mr. Seiden contends, is that both of those
campaigns were deserted prematurely. Advertising executives
tend to tire of campaigns before the public does, and
advertisers sometimes walk away from strategies when nothing
needs fixing, he says. The Riunite theme "really never
should've been dropped."
   To be sure, some advertisers have been successful
resurrecting ad themes that probably shouldn't have been
abandoned in the first place. Nestle, for example, brought
back the "Nestea Plunge" after struggling with other ad
campaigns for five years. But in deciding to revive the
concept, Nestle found that one-third of surveyed consumers
thought the ads were still on the air.
   In large part, however, marketing experts say, advertisers
stuck with ailing brands are better off moving on to new
approaches rather than holding out for an old campaign to
turn around fortunes.
   "When marketers just don't know what to do next, they seem
to always look backwards when they should be looking
forwards," says Jeffrey B. Hirsch, president of Hirsch
Marketing, a Venice, Calif.-based marketing consultancy.
   Mr. Hirsch and others are especially skeptical about
Wendy's plans to try its hand with the "Where's the Beef?"
slogan again. "It was more Clara's delivery of the line than
the line itself that made the campaign so memorable," Mr.
Hirsch says.
   Wendy's concedes it's not sure what type of response the
test commercial will get. "There's no question that any time
you hit a grand slam home run, you want to aim again," a
spokesman says. "But we own the line and we know that people
associate `Where's the Beef?' with Wendy's."
   The new commercial, which will be tested in a couple of
undisclosed markets, will feature not a Clara Peller
look-alike but Dave Thomas, the firm's founder and senior
chairman. In the new ad, it will be Mr. Thomas, a low-key,
down-home kind of guy, uttering the famous line. "We fully
recognize that you can't fully replace Clara Peller," the
spokesman says. "But this might just work."
   Banfi's decision to revive the "Riunite on Ice" theme has
raised even more questions. Skeptics point to the sliding
sales of the brand -- a victim, though, to a big drop in
overall wine consumption -- and say the brand needs a
complete marketing makeover, not simply a revival of past
efforts that may conjure up some negative imagery among
consumers.
   Mr. Seiden, however, says Riunite encountered problems not
only because it abandoned the slogan but also because it
mistakenly went after an older, more upscale market than the
college-age kids who had always been the centerpiece of the
brand's franchise. "We lost sight of our heritage," he says.
   Some advertising executives say the decision to revive an
ad slogan has to be made case by case. Perrier, for example,
arguably couldn't go forward with its old commercials ("It's
Perfect. It's Perrier.) after traces of the product were
found to be contaminated with benzene. That disaster forced
the company to recall bottles of the mineral water
world-wide.
   So it was fitting to return to the "Earth's First Soft
Drink" theme, insists Joseph LaRosa, chairman of Waring &amp;
LaRosa, which created the first campaign with that slogan in
1981. "The original campaign ran for well over five years,
and it was enormously successful," he says. "The reaction to
the commercials we've just finished has been very positive."

   Ralston Picks Fallon
                                                                                                       

   Fallon McElligott got a big new-business boost Friday,
winning a $25 million pet food assignment from Ralston
Purina.
   Minneapolis-based Fallon will be responsible for creating
what Ralston calls a "line campaign" that will advertise four
of the company's dog food brands simultaneously. The brands
are Dog Chow, Puppy Chow, Hi-Pro and Fit &amp; Trim.
   In winning the account, Fallon bested a field that
included Ally &amp; Gargano, Martin Marshall Jaccoma Mitchell,
DDB Needham, Tatham-Laird &amp; Kudner and Centra Advertising,
Ralston's in-house agency.
   A spokesman for St. Louis-based Ralston wouldn't say how
the individual ad budgets for the brands will be affected as
a result of the big new-line effort. Currently, Centra
handles the Dog Chow and Puppy Chow accounts. Ally &amp; Gargano
creates ads for Hi-Pro. Fit &amp; Trim has been inactive
recently.

   NEW YORK -- Discount broker Quick &amp; Reilly Group Inc.
boosted, to 44 cents a share from 34 cents, its projection of
the acquisition-related charges it will take for the fiscal
year ending Feb. 28.
   The company had made the 34-cent estimate in late March,
but it said last week that that number reflects only the
costs of the acquisitions by its JJC Specialist Corp. The
revised charge reflects costs of all of Quick &amp; Reilly's
acquisitions for fiscal 1991.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The estimated charges are net of any tax benefits the
company might receive from the acquisitions.
   Quick &amp; Reilly also expects to report that per-share
earnings for the first quarter, ended May 25, were flat at 31
cents. Earnings for the year-earlier period were $2.9 million
on revenue of $24.4 million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Quick
&amp; Reilly fell 25 cents to $15.25.

it's an accurate statement to say that we're cooperating
fully."
   Neither Mr. Richards nor his attorney, James Streicker,
could be reached yesterday for comment.
   The civil suit, filed by two shareholders in public funds
formerly managed by Mr. Richards, alleges that Mr. Richards
diverted unprofitable stock-index futures trades to the
funds, while assigning profitable trades to a Kemper employee
profit-sharing account.
   Ms. Hall said she didn't know when federal authorities
began their inquiry of the trades. "We do not think the
allegations have any merit," she said. "We do not think there
was any wrongdoing on behalf of Mr. Richards or anyone else
at the company."

   PARIS -- Lafarge Coppee S.A., the world's second-largest
cement company, said it reached an investment and cooperation
agreement with East Germany's largest cement concern,
Karsdorf.
   Under the agreement, France's Lafarge said it will help
modernize Karsdorf's factory and, if approved by the East
German government, take a "significant" stake in the company.
Lafarge didn't say how large the stake would be.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The announcement marks one of the first significant French
investments in East Germany.
   East German officials have announced a series of joint
ventures involving West German interests, and have expressed
disappointment that French concerns weren't more active in
East Germany.
   Lafarge said Karsdorf is located near Leipzig and produced
roughly one-third of East Germany's 1989 cement output of 12
million metric tons.
   Lafarge said its own annual cement production capacity is
50 million metric tons, located primarily in France, Spain
and North America. A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds.

   Aerospatiale Mulls
   France's Stake
   In Dassault Firm

   PARIS -- Henri Martre, chairman of Aerospatiale, said it
would be a good thing for the government to transfer its
controlling stake in Dassault aircraft company to the
state-owned aircraft giant.
   His comments, made during a visit to Turkey, were reported
Saturday by the French news agency Agence France-Presse.
Aerospatiale couldn't immediately be reached for
confirmation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Dassault, whose full name is Avions Marcel
Dassault-Breguet Aviation S.A., long has been fiercely
independent. Chairman Serge Dassault, son of founder Marcel
Dassault, has repeatedly rejected suggestions that his
fighter-airplane concern should ally with Aerospatiale, a
larger, more bureaucratic company.
   Dassault has been profitable, thanks to French government
orders. But with military tensions declining, Dassault has
had trouble finding fighter-airplane orders outside France.
While the Dassault family owns the majority of Dassault
shares, the government, through double voting rights,
controls the majority of votes at shareholders' meetings.
Such a meeting is scheduled for next week.
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement suggested more
than a year ago that Dassault and Aerospatiale seek an
association, an idea that sent tremors through the defense
establishment and eventually was abandoned. But easing
East-West tensions since then has led government officials to
begin rethinking the issue. The company's independent style
has ruffled feathers in the defense establishment. Since
1986, Mr. Dassault has struggled -- so far successfully -- to
keep management control of the family concern.
   "An eventual transfer to Aerospatiale of the state's stake
in Dassault could only help relations between the two
groups," Mr. Martre was quoted by the French news agency as
telling journalists in Turkey. "It wouldn't help
Aerospatiale, but it would help Dassault, and it would help
the French aeronautics industry a lot."
   According to the French news agency, Mr. Martre stressed
that the decision isn't up to him. But he also ruled out
sharing the government's Dassault stake with Thomson S.A.,
the state electronics group, saying "an electronics group
wouldn't bring anything, because this business is radically
different from aeronautics."

   HAMPTON, N.H. -- Henley Group Inc. said it modified its
plan to reorganize and spin off its two largest operating
units as separate companies.
   Henley said it decided to distribute 35% of the shares of
Pneumo Abex Corp., an aerospace parts company, instead of
100% as originally proposed. It said the planned distribution
of all of the shares of Fisher International Inc., formerly
Fisher Scientific Group Inc., a laboratory equipment maker,
won't be affected.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The revisions are designed to benefit Henley shareholders
by simplifying the financing arrangements in the
reorganization plan, the company said.
   Henley, spun off from Allied-Signal Corp. four years ago
with 35 different businesses that didn't fit in Allied's
plans, has been reorganizing and spinning off companies in an
effort to increase shareholder value.
   After the distributions, Henley would continue to hold a
company that makes brakes, a methanol plant in Chile, 14.7
million shares of Itel Corp., and certain other investments.
The company said it expects to liquidate or dispose of those
assets during 1991.

   HENLEY GROUP Inc.'s Pneumo Abex Corp. subsidiary will
continue to own its brakes division after Henley distributes
35% of Pneumo Abex to shareholders. Henley, which dropped an
earlier plan to spin off 100% of Pneumo Abex to shareholders,
would have purchased the brakes division from Pneumo Abex
under the earlier plan, Henley said, clarifying a story in
yesterday's edition.

   SAULT STE. MARIE, Ontario -- Algoma Steel Corp. said it
hired Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to find a buyer for its U.S. coal
and iron ore interests.
   Algoma Steel, a unit of Dofasco Inc. of Hamilton, Ontario,
Canada's largest steelmaker, said its coal interests consist
of four operations in West Virginia. Last year these
operations produced about three million net tons of steam
coal and 1.6 million net tons of metallurgical coal.

   Algoma Steel said its U.S. iron ore operations are held
through its partnership interests in the Tilden Mine near
Ishpeming, Mich. The company said its share of production at
the mine is 2.6 million tons a year.
   Other owners of the Tilden mine are Stelco Inc. of
Hamilton and Cleveland-based Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., which
also manages the mine. Cleveland-Cliffs said total production
at Tilden this year is expected to be 6.5 million tons.
   Algoma Steel, which didn't disclose an asking price, said
the planned sale is consistent with the company's strategy of
focusing on its core steel manufacturing business. It said
proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to
reduce debt.

   Abreast of the Market:
   Humbled Asset Allocators Are Learning
   Some Hard Lessons About Stock Market
   ----

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- For all their computers telling them which
market is the better-valued investment, tactical asset
allocators are performing dismally.
   They have sat out much of the recent stock market rally
with bonds and cash stuffed in their portfolios. Though
they're breathing a little easier after the Dow Jones
Industrial Average retreated 2.5% from last Monday's record,
many asset allocators still lag behind the market by 2% or
more.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They've been a huge disappointment since November 1987,"
says James A. Carmack, whose firm specializes in analyzing
tactical asset allocators' performance. "But prior to that
they were the teacher's pet with excellent results of
protecting assets." Over the past few years, most asset
allocators have been lucky to tie market benchmarks such as
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.
   This is a highly disciplined school of investors that uses
sophisticated computer models to blend the right mix of
stocks, bonds and cash to preserve capital while keeping up
with the indexes. Once they chart their course, tactical
allocators usually stick to it come what may, which sometimes
means watching in humiliation as their models crash and burn.
But because of their rigid discipline, they are often the
first to discern changes in the stock market's behavior.
   Among the things tactical asset allocators are learning
about the current market, three stand out:
                                                                                                       

   -- Investors aren't demanding as much reward as they used
to for the risk of owning stocks.
                                                                                                       

   Andrew Harmstone, a vice president at J.P. Morgan
Investment Management, has a negative view of the stock
market as reflected in his current standard account mix of
25.3% stocks, 58.3% bonds and 16.4% cash.
   One of the most important value-measuring tools in Mr.
Harmstone's model is the risk of holding stocks relative to
bonds. Historically, investors want stocks to deliver a
return -- price change plus dividends -- of about 2.3
percentage points more than bonds to compensate them for
volatility and risk.
   But these days, Mr. Harmstone's model tells him that
investors are accepting a "risk premium" in stocks of a mere
0.9 percentage point above returns on bonds. "It's possible
that investors are becoming more tolerant, more complacent
about risk," he says. If that's true, Mr. Harmstone may have
to change his model.
   But he doesn't think that's the case. Sooner or later, he
says, the risk of owning stocks at current prices will make
itself apparent to investors. Mr. Harmstone suggests negative
earnings surprises could be the catalyst.
   However it starts, Mr. Harmstone strongly believes the
historical "risk premium" of stocks over bonds will be
restored by both a retreat in stock prices and a decline in
bond yields -- which pushes up bond prices -- with the
sharper adjustment in stocks.
   That's why he's heavily weighted in bonds, which his model
says are priced cheaply compared with the slowing rate of
inflation.
   Susan Byrne, who manages the $65 million Westwood Fund,
has higher exposure to stocks than Mr. Harmstone. But since
the end of 1989 she has cut her stock exposure to 70.2% from
86.1% and raised bond exposure to 26.7% from 1.8%.
   Ms. Byrne's economic model for 1990 is forecasting a 5%
rise in S&amp;P 500 earnings, no gain in inflation, and economic
growth of about 2%. That means about a 5% to 8% gain for
stocks this year, which is slightly less competitive than her
model's predicted returns on bonds.
   Ms. Byrne is unimpressed by the Dow's recent run to new
records. "If the Dow Jones industrials go to 3000 this year,
you could have captured that return on a CD," she says. The
higher the market goes, the more risk, she thinks, because
her model indicates the risk of recession is greater than
more expansive growth. Expectations of lower earnings could
send stocks down 12% to 15% this year, she says.
                                                                                                       

   -- Investors are placing a higher value on future earnings
growth than underlying assets.
                                                                                                       

   Michael FitzGerald and Richard Boling, managing directors
at TSA Capital Management, invest about $1.5 billion with
asset allocation strategies. TSA values stocks according to
earnings yield, the movement of stock prices over time --
what technical analysts call "momentum" -- and a proprietary
model that takes account of economic data.
   Currently, TSA's value model says stocks are too expensive
relative to earnings. "Earnings yield by the way we measure
it is about 7.25% on the S&amp;P 500," says Mr. FitzGerald, which
doesn't compete with current returns of about 8.4% on
Treasury securities. Even so, TSA has recently sold out of
its bond position, which dragged down performance when
interest rates rose sharply this spring, and is now 100%
invested in stocks.
   One reason for their apparent heresy, Messrs. Boling and
FitzGerald say, is that traditional valuation measures are
being ignored to some extent by many other investors. "The
market isn't focusing on value -- neither dividend yield,
price-to-book ratios or price-earnings ratios," says Mr.
FitzGerald. "The market may be focusing on growth in
earnings."
   The "100% stock" signal Messrs. Boling and FitzGerald are
following comes from their momentum and economic indicators:
Investors are anticipating strong future earnings growth and
don't think stock prices reflect that earnings potential at
today's prices.
   "We fully believe that stocks will be the best-performing
asset in the coming days," Mr. FitzGerald says.
   Ms. Byrne also thinks that the stock market is focusing on
future earnings growth, but adds that many growth stocks of
the 1980s, such as those of consumer companies, are probably
overvalued.
   Her current 70.2% stock position has a heavy weighting in
drug stocks such as Bristol-Myers Squibb, Schering-Plough and
Syntex -- all of which are undervalued on the basis of
predicted future earnings growth.
                                                                                                       

   -- Investors correctly anticipated that rising interest
rates would cool inflation.
                                                                                                       

   Last year, when short-term rates rose above 9%, TSA stuck
with a large cash position. But stocks in 1989 turned in one
of the best returns of the decade. "When short-term interest
rates are rising," Mr. FitzGerald says, "normally that's a
very bad time to hold stocks and you want to be in cash. And
that's what our model showed."
   With benefit of hindsight, Mr. FitzGerald figures that
stock investors viewed the rise in short-term interest rates
as a positive influence on future earnings growth. High
short-term rates would help cool inflation, and
inflation-adjusted earnings therefore would be stronger down
the road.
   As a result, 1989 "was a good year for stocks in spite of
the fact that most asset allocation models thought 9% cash
was the place to be," says Mr. FitzGerald. The S&amp;P was up
31.68% last year while TSA's asset allocation portfolios were
up about 17%.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for the fourth
consecutive day, tumbling 34.95 to 2862.38 on moderate New
York Stock Exchange volume of 142.6 million shares. The
four-day loss of 72.81 points followed Monday's record high
of 2935.19. For the week, the industrial average lost 38.59
points, or 1.3%.
   Stock-index arbitrage, in which traders sell stocks and
buy stock-index futures to lock in price differences,
accounted for part of Friday's decline, traders said. Futures
became cheaper than underlying stocks as large investors
turned bearish on the market and sold Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index futures.
   Adding to the selling pressure were falling bond prices
and stock investors looking to lock in some of their profits
before the weekend. The latest round of profit-taking focused
on the entertainment, retailing and financial stocks.
   Last week's setback broke a string of five consecutive
weekly advances, over which the average rallied a total of
255.22 points, or 9.6%; the winning streak was the longest
since last summer.
   Declining stocks routed advancers on the Big Board by
1,010 to 458. S&amp;P's 500-stock index dropped 4.44 to 358.71
for a 1.1% loss for the week, while the New York Stock
Exchange composite index fell 2.16 Friday to 196.05 for a 1%
decline. The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index
skidded 2.40 to 361.17, ending the week with a loss of 0.7%.
   Profit-taking hit several entertainment stocks. Walt
Disney fell 4 7/8 to 123 3/8, Time Warner declined 2 7/8 to
107 3/4 and MCA dropped 1 3/4 to 56 3/4.
   News Corp., which owns Twentieth Century Fox Film, bucked
the group's downturn. It rose 3/4 to 17 1/2; the debt-laden
company said Thursday that it plans to sell a 49% interest in
South China Morning Post Holdings Ltd.
   Gap Inc. fell 2 3/8 to 56 1/8 after analysts cut their
earnings estimates for the second quarter and full year of
fiscal 1991 in response to weak sales data.
   Other specialty retailers also sagged amid profit-taking.
Limited Inc. fell 1 to 46 3/8, Lowe's fell 1 to 45 1/2, Home
Depot dropped 5/8 to 56 3/4 and Rite Aid slid 1 to 33 3/8.
   Several insurance stocks also fared worse than the market,
including Alexander &amp; Alexander Services, down 1 1/4 to 26
5/8. Aetna Life &amp; Casualty lost 7/8 to 52, Travelers fell 5/8
to 31, Cigna slid 1 7/8 to 52 3/4, General Re fell 2 5/8 to
87 1/8, Marsh &amp; McLennan fell 2 3/8 to 76 3/8 and Loews lost
3 1/4 to 112 5/8.
   Other weak financial issues were Manufacturers Hanover,
down 7/8 to 36 5/8; Merrill Lynch, down 1 1/8 to 23 3/4;
Golden West Financial, down 1 3/8 to 33 3/8, Security
Pacific, down 1 5/8 to 41 1/8, and Sovran Financial, down 1
to 32 1/2.
   Among technology stocks, International Business Machines
dropped 1 7/8 to 118 3/4, Compaq Computer fell 2 5/8 to 119
1/8, Texas Instruments lost 1 5/8 to 39 3/8 and Motorola
tumbled 2 3/8 to 83 1/2.
   Maytag jumped 2 to 19 on 1.1 million shares amid rumors
that the company could attract a foreign suitor. Maytag
declined to comment on the activity in its shares.
   Campbell Soup rose 3/4 to 59 1/4 on renewed speculation
that the company may become a takeover target. Campbell
declined to comment.
   ConAgra gained 1 1/4 to 33 1/4 after agreeing to acquire
Beatrice, which would give the company such brand names as
Hunt's and Wesson and boost its clout in the grocery
business.
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines gained 5/8 to 18 3/4. The company
confirmed that the Argentine government has invited it to
participate with a group studying the privatization of the
country's national airline.
   McDermott International added 3/8 to 30 on a positive
report in Business Week magazine's "Inside Wall Street"
column.
   Rohr Industries gained 1 to 23 7/8 on an analyst's bullish
comments on the company's earnings prospects.
   Guardsman Products fell 1 1/8 to 12 3/4 after the company
said it is less optimistic than previously about its
second-quarter and 1990 results.

   MILLBRAE, Calif. -- Genentech Inc. said its shareholders
overwhelmingly approved the company's plan to allow Roche
Holding Ltd. to acquire 60% of Genentech's stock, paving the
way for foreign control of the company that pioneered
biotechnology.
   Genentech said shareholders at its annual meeting voted
97% in favor of the agreement with Roche of Switzerland. The
agreement calls for Roche to pay $2.1 billion for a 60%
Genentech stake, and gives Roche an option to acquire the
remaining interest for as much as $2.5 billion more.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the agreement, Roche will invest about $492 million
in capital in Genentech, and pay stockholders $36 plus one
share of a new common stock for every two Genentech shares.
Despite shareholder suits seeking to block the merger, few
expected stockholders to veto the transaction.
   The acquisition's completion is important to Genentech
because it provides money to finance its diverse
drug-development program without worrying about Wall Street's
reaction to quarterly earnings.
   The transaction, announced in February, must still be
approved by the Federal Trade Commission, which last March
requested additional information on the proposed merger. The
companies say they are working to satisfy the request.

   Pretax earnings were hurt by growing marketing and
administrative costs, which rose 5.4% to 120.7 billion yen,
and by nonoperating costs, which surged 39% to 12.39 billion
yen. Extraordinary gains shrank sharply to 336 million yen in
fiscal 1990 from 3.92 billion yen a year earlier, when
Daihatsu sold fixed assets.
   Motor vehicle sales, which accounted for 78% of total
sales, fell 1.2% to 599.22 billion yen, but its parts sales
climbed 12% to 92.17 billion yen. Sales of the company's
other products went up 15% to 74.69 billion yen.

   MADRID -- Mercapital S.A., a Spanish financial company 25%
owned by Cie. Financiere de Suez of France, said it will take
a 40% stake in Spanish brokerage firm Usera &amp; Morenes.
   The accord, reached after several weeks of talks, is
designed to strengthen Mercapital's position in the
financial-services market, a spokesman said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It also reflects the growing difficulties for independent
brokerage firms in Spain's increasingly competitive stock
market.
   Usera &amp; Morenes, set up last year as a partnership between
three stockbrokers at the time of changes on Spain's stock
market, was for much of last year one of Spain's market
leaders. But it ran into problems in relation to an inquiry
by the Spanish National Stock Market Commission into
irregularities allegedly committed at the time of a stock
offering by oil company Repsol S.A. last year.
   Though no sanctions have been announced against Usera &amp;
Morenes, the negative publicity caused by the allegations led
to a fall in its business in the first quarter of this year.
At the same time, staffing problems forced it to slash staff
by around 50%, contributing to a first-quarter loss of 212
million pesetas ($2 million).
   Following its acquisition, the brokerage firm will become
a direct subsidiary of Mercapital's banking unit, Bancapital.
The price of the purchase will depend on an audit of the firm
currently in process, Mercapital said. Bancapital is 35%
owned by Mercapital and has four offices, in Madrid,
Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- An inquiry by State Attorney General
Robert Abrams into the finances of a newspaper sold by the
homeless is now focusing on the paper's founder Hutchinson
Persons, who quit last week, a spokesman said Saturday.
   New York Newsday, quoting sources, reported that employees
of Street News have told the attorney general's office that
as much as $250,000 is unaccounted for.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We received reports that he may have left and may have
taken money with him. We're investigating those charges,"
said a spokesman for Mr. Abrams.
   A message left on Mr. Persons's answering machine wasn't
immediately returned, but he and others have said repeatedly
that those who started the paper six months ago worked for
little or no money until he accepted a salary of less than
$50,000 early this year.
   Wendy Koltun, the paper's co-founder who left Street News
in January in a disagreement over Mr. Persons's management
style, said she was confident the allegations that Mr.
Persons took money were false.
   She said she believes the rumors about him taking money
began with a disgruntled employee who wanted to start her own
newspaper.
   Street News began publishing in November. It has been sold
on streets and subways around Manhattan by homeless people
who keep 50 cents of the 75 cents for each sale.

   Arizona Utility
   Plans More Cuts

   Arizona Public Service Co., the main unit of Pinnacle West
Capital Corp., said it will slash its work force further and
will revamp operations to hold down its rates, which it
conceded are among the highest in the utility industry.
   The proposed belt-tightening moves come in the wake of
Pinnacle West's rejection of both PacifiCorp's $1.82 billion
takeover bid and Salt River Project's $500 million proposal
to buy some of the assets of Phoenix-based Arizona Public
Service.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pinnacle West suspended its 40-cent-a-share common stock
dividend in October, and announced at its May 23 annual
meeting that it probably won't resume payouts for another
three years.
   Arizona Public Service, which has already slashed its work
force to 7,700 employees from 9,100, said that the current
announced cuts would go beyond the 150 previously planned for
1990. A spokesman said the company hasn't determined the
exact number yet. It also is attempting to reduce a 21%,
three-year rate increase it had requested from the Arizona
Corporation Commission beginning in 1991.
   "We must reduce our costs to be around in the 1990s," the
spokesman said.
   Spokesmen at PacifiCorp and Salt River Project said the
downsizing plans won't affect their bids. A spokesman for
PacifiCorp, a Portland, Ore., utility, said "it's unfortunate
that the company has to take such Draconian moves against
their own employees."
   Arizona Public Service said it has hired the Lexington,
Mass., consulting firm of Temple, Barker &amp; Sloan to assist in
the cutbacks.
   The Phoenix utility said it has been trying to cut costs
since 1988 through the dismissals, cuts in capital
expenditures and by encouraging out-of-state businesses to
move into its utility territory.
   The Arizona Public Service spokesman said the utility has
been "under a multitude of pressures to cut costs."
   PacifiCorp, which has made several recent hostile
acquisition bids for Pinnacle West, said that if it took over
the company it would increase utility rates 2% per year for
four years. Arizona Public Service, the state's largest
utility, had proposed annual rate increases of 6.5% between
1991 and 1994.
   Salt River Project, Arizona's second largest electric
utility, said in its offer for certain distribution and
transmission facilities in the Phoenix area that it wouldn't
raise rates in the acquired areas for five to seven years
until those rates are equal to the lower Salt River rates. In
the past two weeks, a Phoenix councilman has proposed that
the city study the possibility of seizing some Arizona Public
Service utility territory and giving the business to someone
else, possibly Salt River Project, which serves areas
surrounding Phoenix.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Pinnacle
shares closed Friday at $15.875, off 25 cents.

   Don't Be Alarmed by FDI
   ----
   By Susan W. Liebeler
</HL>
<DATE>

</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12
</SO>
<LP>
   The recent acquisitions of Rockefeller Center and Columbia
Pictures have caused some worry that foreign investors are
buying the soul of America. While such transactions are
highly visible, the actual causes and effects of foreign
investment are much harder to discern. This task is made more
difficult still by the surfeit of books and articles about
foreign investment in the U.S., most of which rely heavily on
anecdotal evidence. In my view, much of this literature has
sacrificed credibility in favor of alarmist tones and
superficial analysis.
   The notable exception is "Foreign Direct Investment in the
United States" (147 pages, $11.95) by Edward M. Graham of
Duke's Fuqua School of Business and Paul R. Krugman of MIT's
Department of Economics. Published by the Institute for
International Economics in Washington, D.C., it offers an
excellent analytical treatment of the many issues raised by
foreign direct investment (FDI). It also is accessible to
laymen, a rare occurrence in the literature of economics, and
it should lay to rest much of the irresponsible rhetoric
about FDI heard inside the Capitol Beltway.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The focus of the debate on foreign investment in the U.S.
has been on FDI, which, unlike portfolio investment, gives
foreign investors the ability to control specific assets. The
Commerce Department, which collects data on foreign
investment, classifies an interest as FDI when the investor
holds at least a 10% equity interest in U.S. business or real
estate.
   Messrs. Graham and Krugman dispel the most popular
explanation for the rise in FDI -- that it is a result of the
growth of the trade deficit -- by demonstrating that the
growth in FDI began back in the early 1970s, when the U.S.
frequently enjoyed trade surpluses and FDI surged between
1977 and 1981, tailing off before the rise of the huge
deficits. Nor is the claim that the growth of FDI is spurred
by lower foreign interest rates convincing. Even assuming
that foreign interest rates were lower, this would not
explain the heavy reliance on local financing. Messrs. Graham
and Krugman also reject the old saw that foreigners are
buying America on the cheap. Although the falling U.S. dollar
makes U.S. companies less expensive in foreign currencies, it
also makes their profit stream less valuable.
   In the authors' view, the best explanation for the growth
of FDI is the standard economist's explanation, that it
allows foreign multinationals to produce goods locally when
they have an advantage in technology or management skills
over their domestic competitors.
   This explanation accords with the change in the world
economic system after World War II. Instead of being the
pre-eminent economic power, the U.S. now is the leading
economic power among such peers as West Germany, Japan, the
United Kingdom and France. U.S. multinationals no longer have
a monopoly on the best technology and management. As a
consequence of the maturation of the economies of other
nations, FDI in the U.S. is approaching the levels existing
in other industrial economies, although inward direct
investment still has a long way to go to reach the level of
FDI common in other industrialized countries.
   Many of the critics' arguments about the dangers of FDI
fare no better than their explanations for its growth. Claims
that FDI costs America jobs, transfers good jobs overseas,
reduces local research and development and worsens the trade
deficit all are systematically refuted by the evidence. On
other arguments, that FDI increases imports or that foreign
firms have bought high-tech U.S. firms and transferred their
technology abroad leaving hollowed-out shell corporations,
the authors point to a dearth of hard evidence either way. In
sum, no case has been made that FDI presents a danger to the
U.S. economy.
   The authors successfully debunk the myths circulated by
the critics of foreign investment. Their research is careful,
their writing clear, and their analysis incisive. What their
book lacks, however, is a slick cover, a catchy title, and
self-serving quotations from politicians and representatives
of special interests. Without sensationalist innuendoes about
takeovers and a doomsday message, this serious and important
study is likely to be swamped by its more flashily marketed
competition.
   Curiously, this seems to be true even in Japan, where
Japan-bashing books enjoy surprising popularity. The Japanese
have a great thirst for information about the U.S., their
largest and most important trading partner. Japan-bashing
books are readily available in a number of Tokyo bookstores,
and their authors lecture in Japan for hefty fees. But on a
recent trip to Tokyo I was unable to find a single copy of
the Graham/Krugman book. It is ironic that the Japanese are
doing so much to encourage their critics, while neglecting
the more balanced work of serious scholars.

   Boston -- When two girls called 12-year-old Tanisha a
"nigger" on her school bus here, Tanisha was stung. Her best
friend, Jennifer, who is white, wanted to defend her, but
didn't know how.
   Should they hit the girls? Come back with an insult of
their own? Wait and tell an adult? Or just ignore the pair,
and console each other? "I would tell the driver," says
four-year-old Kate Goldsworthy while watching Tanisha talk
about this encounter in an interactive video that's part of a
new exhibit at the Children's Museum here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The Kids Bridge" aims to get visitors talking and
thinking about racial differences and to reduce racism by
having them see things from other kids' points of view.
   All that's not easy at a children's museum, where hundreds
of screaming youngsters run through halls poking at exhibits
such as a giant nose that sneezes on command. But because the
museum draws so many children (about 270,000 a year), it is a
logical place to expose them to things they might not
normally see.
   "For the first time, a cultural institution has addressed
the issues of racism and cultural discrimination for kids,"
says Gail Eaton of the museum. "We hope that somehow, in the
car on the way home, kids will talk about racism . . . {with
a} new awareness."
   To get to "The Kids Bridge" visitors must first pass the
popular Climbing Sculpture, a three-story jungle gym-type
structure that holds more than 30 kids at a time -- and cross
a 46-foot-long footbridge into a setting suggesting Greater
Boston at dusk.
   The idea is to help children "bridge" things that seem
separated. Interactive videos take visitors on treasure hunts
through racially isolated and stereotyped Boston
neighborhoods, guided by children from those neighborhoods.
Other interactive videos show real children, not actors,
talking about racial incidents involving black, Vietnamese
and Hispanic children. Viewers learn that many children are
harassed because of their race and that it's OK to talk about
it.
   Another video, "Talking to Each Other," has five
Boston-area children teaching words in their native
languages. Three sound booths play cross-cultural lullabies;
and a diorama of different Boston neighborhoods lets kids
peek at a Chinese family celebrating a baby's First Moon (his
first 30 days of life), and other moments from the real lives
of the city's citizens.
   The exhibit was prompted by a local government study that
predicts 54% of Boston's population will consist of groups
currently considered minorities by 1995. Right now, Boston
has about a 38% minority population. Aylette Jenness and
Joanne Rizzi, co-directors of the museum's multicultural
program, spent three years creating the exhibit and were
helped by more than 100 local corporations and foundations,
and a multiracial committee of community members. "The Kids
Bridge" cost $500,000 and will remain at the museum for at
least five years.
   More than 80,000 people have visited the exhibit since it
opened in April, including almost 42,000 children aged 2 to
14. But in a city like Boston, which still bears scars from
the school integration battle of the 1970s, the full impact
of the exhibit remains uncertain.
   "We wanted to do an exhibit that spoke to the needs of
Boston," says Ms. Jenness. "The buzzword is, by the end of
this century, people of color will be the majority in this
country. Parents haven't necessarily prepared their children
for that."
   Indeed, not every child visiting the exhibit early one
afternoon seemed particularly keen on learning about other
cultures. Some visitors, such as a seven-year-old girl from
suburban Belmont, spend more time listening to the English
version of words in an interactive video than to the Haitian
Creole, Cantonese, Spanish or Cambodian Khmer versions. The
girl shrugged her shoulders when asked if she would react
differently now to name-calling at school. Others could
hardly sit still long enough to listen to the words in the
music booths or put together a puzzle of multiracial
families.
   Still, some children, like Debbie Goff, 9, of Worcester,
Mass., got so engrossed in the exhibit that they had to be
pulled away by parents and school staff. Debbie spent almost
30 minutes at the foreign-language interactive video, before
her grandfather urged her to move on. She learned words like
"thanks" in Haitian Creole ("mesi"), and "boyfriend" in
Spanish ("novio"). Nine-year-old Peter McCarthy of suburban
Belmont spent 15 minutes searching for an Irish claddagh ring
(a symbol of friendship and love) as part of a treasure hunt
in a different video.
   And Kate Goldsworthy came up with four or five solutions
to handling the racial taunts hurled at Tanisha on the school
bus. When her mother suggested that telling the bus driver
mightn't be possible because he could be too busy driving,
Kate said, "I would tell the teacher when I got to school . .
. If someone called me names and threw snowballs at me in my
front yard, I'd feel upset. I'd run and tell my mother."
   "The Kids Bridge" has been received enthusiastically by
Boston-area schools, says Leslie Swartz, director of teacher
services for the museum. But she adds that the museum hopes
the exhibit will be only a starting point that will encourage
schools to continue teaching kids about racism and ethnic
diversity.
   To give schools a nudge, the museum is offering teacher
training seminars this summer that will study in detail the
various ethnic groups living in Boston. The museum also is
developing a multicultural curriculum that can be used in
Boston classrooms. So far, about 30 teachers have signed up
for the training program.
   "The exhibit . . . {is} a jumping off point for a lot of
teachers who wish to address this issue in their classrooms,"
says Bessie Lyman, director of Black Achievement, a Newton
public schools office that works with staff, students and
parents to close the gap of achievement between blacks and
non-blacks.
   Teachers in Newton had been searching for a way to show
children that diversity is a plus, says Mrs. Lyman. "The
exhibit is precisely what we wanted to address. It's
important for children to be exposed to people of other
cultures and races {in more ways than} just one line in a
textbook about slaves and the Holocaust," she says.

   Future historians may pinpoint last Friday as the date
communism finally conceded the rhetorical war. With a
visiting Margaret Thatcher sitting beside him and nodding in
approval, Mikhail Gorbachev told a live, televised news
conference in Moscow that the creation of a market economy in
the Soviet Union was "essential." When reminded of criticism
that he was abandoning communism, Mr. Gorbachev went further
still. "The market is not an invention of capitalism," the
Soviet leader declared. "It has existed for centuries. It is
an invention of civilization."

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Transamerica Corp. said it agreed to
acquire First Interstate Bancorp's consumer-lending operation
for $108 million, in what is part of First Interstate's
effort to shore up battered earnings.
   Under the agreement, expected to close in July,
Transamerica will acquire First Interstate's Nova Financial
Services operation, which had about $430 million in
receivables on March 31. First Interstate said it expects a
pretax gain of more than $90 million from the sale.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The gain on the sale was higher than some analysts
expected. "The level of profit is good," said analyst Donald
Crowley at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, who expected the unit to
sell for $70 million to $80 million. Selling the Nova unit
was the biggest part of First Interstate's divestment
strategy in which, he said, "They're trying to get rid of
what they consider nonstrategic assets." First Interstate put
Nova up for sale last March and is also trying to sell its
Los Angeles headquarters building.
   The accord expands Transamerica's finance group, which
provided about half of the company's 1989 net earnings of
$332 million on revenue of $6.8 billion. Transamerica, with
$30.3 billion in assets, had $3.1 billion in finance
receivables outstanding on March 31. Transamerica said the
Nova acquisition will increase its total assets by about 5%
to $9.5 billion.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday,
Transamerica's stock closed at $39.375, down 62.5 cents;
First Interstate's shares closed at $42.375, down 50 cents.

   WASHINGTON -- Move over M.C. Hammer and you other rappers.
Here comes Rep. Major R. Owens, and he's Baaad.
   Rep. Owens, a liberal Democrat from New York and a former
Brooklyn librarian, has been moved to use "the language and
the attitude of a street constituent" to put the government's
fiscal vice to verse in rap poems.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a poem entitled "The Budget Summit," he likens the
talks between the White House and congressional leaders to "a
meeting of the mob," where aid for the poor and children is
likely to get whacked in order to cut the deficit.
                                                                                                       

   At the big white D.C. mansion
   There's a meeting of the mob
   And the question on the table
   Is which beggars will they rob.
   There's a meeting of the mob
   Now we'll never get a job,
   All the gents will make a deal
   And the poor have no appeal.
                                                                                                       

   The thrift bailout is a recurring theme for rapmaster
Owens. One ditty called "The S and L Riot" paints a biting
vision of thrift executives invited by former President
Reagan to loot the Treasury:
                                                                                                       

   When our mint is picked clean
   Hear these haughty hogs all scream
   That there's no free lunch]
   Only this plump bunch
   Deserves a national free lunch.
                                                                                                       

   While the rhymes may be stilted, and the rhythm a bit
unsteady, the message is always clear. "I feel the
frustration after seven years in a Congress where no funds
can be found for job creation or education to benefit my
constituents," Rep. Owens says. "I sit there unable to do
anything about it, and one way to relieve my anxiety is to
start writing."
   Rep. Owens isn't the only federal official to dabble in
creative writing about fiscal matters. White House Budget
Director Richard Darman has written floridly of Cookie
Monsters and hidden Pacmen lurking within the budget. But
while Mr. Darman is at the center of the budget summit with
House and Senate leaders, Rep. Owens can only wish that there
were a place for him and his would-be street poetry at the
negotiating table.
   The lawmaker says he'd have a lot to say. If they got
around to cutting social benefits, he might start with:
                                                                                                       

   This rape is obscene
   These gents are real mean
   Keep your children inside
   Teach them true national pride.
   There's a riot at the mint]

   Interest Rates
   Are Pushed Up
   ---
   But Bid to Clip Inflation,
   Slow Loan Demand Fails
   To Meet Goal, Some Say

   HONG KONG -- Monetary authorities in Hong Kong have been
pushing up interest rates to clip inflation and slow loan
demand, but economists say that the action so far hasn't
worked and that rates probably will remain high in the months
ahead.
   Interest rates in the British colony are near historic
highs relative to U.S. rates, helping to slow economic growth
in the first half of the year. Yet even with the high rates
and slower growth, demand for loans continues to outstrip
deposit growth, and inflation, now running at an annual rate
of about 9.5%, has slipped only slightly from 10.1% last
year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Interest rates are going to remain at these levels," said
C.K. Law, research director for Bankers Trust Securities
(Pacific) Ltd. "But they've had no appreciable effect."
   Hong Kong interest rates largely follow rates in the U.S.
because the colony's currency is pegged to the American unit
at 7.80 Hong Kong dollars to one U.S. dollar. If rates move
too far above or below those in the U.S., funds quickly flow
in or out of the Hong Kong dollar, bringing rates back into
line. Yet within those limits, the government can exercise
monetary authority, mainly through the money-market
operations of the Exchange Fund, which holds the colony's
reserves.
   Some economists predict that U.S. interest rates will ease
slightly in the coming months, which probably would bring
Hong Kong rates down as well. However, local economists are
more concerned with the gap between U.S. and Hong Kong rates,
and "I don't see that there are clear indications that the
gap is narrowing," Mr. Law says.
   Secretary for Monetary Affairs David Nendick says he hopes
to keep interest rates relatively high "to get inflation out
of the system." Mr. Nendick would like to reduce inflation to
zero, and he says higher interest rates are the way to do it.
   That may be wishful thinking.
   "I don't think the increase in interest rates will have a
very fast or significant effect on the inflation rate," says
Patrick Chan, an economist at Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corp.
   One problem is that some of the causes of inflation in
Hong Kong don't respond to higher rates. Rising wages, for
example, are a major culprit. Although the labor market isn't
as tight as it was a year ago, the steady outflow of skilled
workers as Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese rule in 1997
approaches makes it possible for many employees to demand
ever larger pay increases.
   And though the latest official figures show a 1.2%
increase in Hong Kong-dollar deposits in April, double the
rate of growth for both February and March, the statistics
also indicate that loan demand continues to outpace deposit
growth.
   Bankers and economists, who don't expect the trend to
change, have grown alarmed by the rising loan-to-deposit
ratio. "Banks more and more are focusing on their Hong Kong
loan book and wondering how they're going to fund it," said
Peter Franklin, Hong Kong managing director for ANZ McCaughan
Securities (Asia) Ltd., a subsidiary of Australia &amp; New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
   In his annual report in late April, Banking Commissioner
Tony Nicolle warned bankers against allowing the gap between
loan growth and deposit growth to widen. The loan-to-deposit
ratio rose to 121.8% at the end of April from 117% at the
start of the year.
   So long as Hong Kong maintains the currency link, interest
rates can be pushed up only so far to damp loan demand. High
inflation in Hong Kong means that real interest rates, the
difference between the inflation rate and the interest rate,
are a low 2%, which actually encourages borrowing.
   At the same time, signs of increasing demand for Hong
Kong-dollar funds have helped maintain high interest rates.
Many banks and corporations are borrowing now to build
reserves in anticipation of even higher rates once the
government begins financing its massive airport and port
infrastructure projects, probably in 1991.
   Additionally, many foreign banks, particularly Japanese
institutions, are lending to corporations in the colony.
Because very few of these banks have a ready supply of Hong
Kong-dollar deposits, they have been forced to raise funds,
adding to demand.
   Three-month interest rates are now more than one
percentage point higher than those in the U.S., an
historically wide spread, and five-year rates are more than
two points above those in the U.S., compared with only one to
1.5 points at the end of last year.

   Criticism of Endowment for Arts Puts Pressure
   On Congress to Reach Accord on Reauthorization

   WASHINGTON -- Pat Williams, a Democratic congressman from
western Montana, gets a lot of unfriendly letters from
constituents.
   "I find myself sickened to think that you represent the
people of Montana," writes one in Great Falls. "You must be
some sort of human oddity," writes another in Laurel. "I pray
the voters will remove you from office," says a third in
Billings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the past few months, Rep. Williams has received 32,000
letters, most of them from angry people. They contend Mr.
Williams, a former school teacher, is peddling pornography.
In his standard letter of reply, Mr. Williams says: "I want
to be absolutely certain you understand I have never
supported pornography or obscenity in any form, nor do I
now."
   Mr. Williams receives such letters because he is chairman
of the subcommittee that authorizes spending for the National
Endowment for the Arts. The federal agency has existed for 28
years, quietly parceling out grants to the likes of the
Philadelphia Orchestra, the Society for American Baseball
Research and the Central Pennsylvania Friends of Jazz.
   But in the past 18 months, the agency supported the artist
Andres Serrano and the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.
Those two grants, out of some 85,000 the agency has made over
the years, caused a furor. Mr. Serrano's work includes a
photograph of a crucifix submerged in a jar of urine, and Mr.
Mapplethorpe's work contains homoerotic images.
   The outcry -- orchestrated by conservative groups -- has
reached the ears of members of Congress. "It's the hottest
button of all right now," says Rep. Steve Gunderson (R.,
Wis.). "It's almost like it's replacing abortion."
   The endowment issue has been raised, unsuccessfully, in
elections in North Carolina and Arkansas.
   Rep. Tom Coleman (R., Mo.) says: "The real problem comes
up at a town meeting back in your district. Some guy stands
up waving a photograph of one of these things, and he wants
to know why you're supporting this kind of stuff. And you're
going to be hard-pressed to respond."
   Congress must vote this election year to reauthorize the
arts agency and to appropriate money for the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1. Conservatives hope to use the votes
individually, or in batches, to defeat liberals.
   His colleagues, says Rep. Williams, are appealing to him
to make changes in the grant-making procedures of the agency.
"`Give me something I can vote for,' they tell me." He's
trying, but so far he has had little help from the
administration.
   President Bush has maintained a low profile on the issue.
In March, he responded to a news-conference question with an
endorsement of the agency's mission, but added that he found
certain works of art offensive. There wasn't any criticism
then of his position. And there isn't any criticism now over
the administration's bill to reauthorize the agency for five
years without any new restrictions on the kind of art it may
fund.
   But the administration position isn't widely popular with
many members of Congress, Democratic or Republican. "We can't
pass it," says Rep. Coleman.
   Anti-pornography forces, led by TV evangelist Pat
Robertson and Donald Wildmon, head of the American Family
Association, have given the administration a free ride,
concentrating their fire on Congress.
   The battle has created internal problems at the agency.
Its chairman, John Frohnmayer, an Oregon lawyer and amateur
singer, fired his senior deputy, Alvin Felzenberg, allegedly
for leaking information to the agency's critics and for
suggesting changes in the agency's procedures. Mr. Felzenberg
is still on the job, but with no work to do, while the White
House looks for somewhere else to put him.
   Last week, the administration altered its position on the
issue. Through Mr. Frohnmayer, it suggested: Reauthorize the
agency for just one year and postpone making changes in its
procedures until a 12-member commission, sworn in last week,
completes a report. The commission was created by Congress to
review the agency's grant-making procedures.
   "It would be unfortunate for Congress to go rushing off
and dismantle the Endowment without listening first to what
this independent commission says," notes Mr. Frohnmayer.
   But hardly anyone, least of all Rep. Williams, wants to
wait a year for a report. He hopes to reach agreement among
his subcommittee members on a multiple-year reauthorization
bill in a week or two. If the issue isn't resolved soon, he
fears, the agency will collapse.
   But reaching agreement won't be easy. The agency's
congressional foes come in two guises.
   The first group, led by Reps. Coleman and Gunderson, would
greatly alter the agency's procedures. The two congressmen
propose that 60% of the agency's funds be turned over to
state agencies, instead of the 20% currently. Of the 40% that
the agency would administer, grants would be for $50,000 and
up and would be limited to "art of national and international
significance." They would prohibit funding of works deemed
obscene as defined by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   That proposal, says Mr. Frohnmayer, "emasculates the
federal presence in the arts, and it has been the federal
presence over all these years that has been responsible for
such a surge in growth in the arts." The arts community
agrees. Last week, museums dimmed their lights and shrouded
their paintings in black to protest attacks on funding
procedures.
   The second group seeks to eliminate the agency altogether.
A leader is Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a freshman Republican from
Orange County, Calif. He says the Coleman-Gunderson provision
to prohibit funding of works deemed to be obscene isn't
satisfactory.
   "Simply because a work of art is legal, and the artist
can't be sent to jail, isn't enough," says Mr. Rohrabacher, a
former Reagan White House speechwriter. He insists the agency
should be abolished, and he will introduce such an amendment.
Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) is expected to make a similar
move in the Senate.

   Hong Kong's Hotel Industry
   Faces a Continuing Slump

   HONG KONG -- The Hong Kong hotel industry, long envied
world-wide for its full houses and firm rates, faces hard
times.
   Visitor arrivals have yet to recover from the slump that
followed the June 4, 1989, crackdown on protesters in
Beijing. At the same time, the number of hotel rooms in the
British colony continues to multiply, as hotels planned years
ago are completed. Further, a persistent labor shortage
threatens to erode an international reputation for exemplary
service.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There will be lean times for two years, even if China
comes back," predicts Peter Jentes, general manager of the
575-room Grand Hyatt Hong Kong, which opened in December.
   Indeed, hoteliers and industry analysts expect competition
for hotel guests to intensify during the next year. Room
discounts have become commonplace, which may be good news for
travelers, but bodes ill for new hotels with heavy
construction-related debts. "The newer properties have to
have cash flow," says James Smith, general manager of the
Hong Kong Hilton and chairman of the Hong Kong Hotels
Association.
   Stock analysts take a bearish view of Hong Kong-listed
hotel companies. In a report on the hotel sector published in
May, Baring Securities (Hong Kong) Ltd. said: "Declining
occupancies and intensifying competition will limit the
upside potential in room rates and hence profitability in the
medium term."
   Two years ago, it was difficult to obtain a hotel room in
Hong Kong without making reservations far in advance. Aided
by a tourism and a business boom in China, average hotel
occupancy rates reached 90% in 1987 and 92% in 1988, compared
with an international average of about 65%.
   But then came the rapid supply increase and the tourism
slowdown. The average occupancy rate slid to 79% last year --
still high by international standards, but Hong Kong's lowest
annual average for the decade -- and hoteliers predict the
rate will fall to 60% this year. Some of the leading hotels
on Hong Kong Island, the site of most of the new
construction, may have trouble maintaining occupancy rates
above 50% during the June-September slow season.
   Although part of the blame lies with Beijing, Hong Kong's
hotel woes are largely of the industry's own making and could
have been foreseen before events last year in China. A hotel
building boom began in the late 1980s, prompted by a stream
of record years for visitor arrivals in the colony that
developers mistakenly thought wouldn't end soon.
   In 1988, according to figures from the Hong Kong Tourist
Association, there were 65 hotels in Hong Kong with a total
of 22,882 rooms. By the end of this year, there will be 77
hotels with 30,572 rooms, a 34% increase in the number of
rooms in two years. By the end of 1992, there will be 96
hotels with 36,572 rooms -- a 60% increase in rooms in four
years.
   These increases in capacity were meant to accommodate
growing numbers of visitors from around the globe. In 1980,
2.3 million people visited Hong Kong; by 1988, the figure had
risen to 5.6 million. The increased traffic was fueled in
part by the opening of China to foreign investment and
tourism. Also swelling the numbers was the strong
appreciation of the yen, which prompted a flood of Japanese
tourists seeking bargains in Hong Kong shops. Taiwan's
decision in 1987 to relax regulations on overseas travel by
its citizens added significantly to the influx.
   But even with such strong underpinnings, the high
occupancy levels of Hong Kong hotels couldn't last
indefinitely. Indeed, with the opening of several large
hotels in late 1988 and early 1989, occupancy rates started
slipping back into the 80% range.
   Then came June 4. Wholesale cancelations of China tours
and business travel reverberated through the colony.
Occupancy rates tumbled in June and July, nearly emptying
hotels that had booked Chinatour groups from the U.S. and
Europe. (Although Hong Kong is a major business and tourist
destination in its own right, China-related travelers are a
significant portion of the market. The Hong Kong Tourist
Association estimates that 23% of visitors to Hong Kong in
1989 also visited China, down from 28% in 1988.)
   Since the start of this year, visitor arrivals have been
creeping back to pre-June 4 levels, but aren't expected to
keep pace with the increase in room supply. Visitor arrivals
in 1989 fell 4.1% from the previous year to about 5.4
million, the first decline in more than a decade. Before June
4, a rise of 11% to 13% had been forecast for the year.
   Yet, the 1989 decline might have been worse if the local
tourism industry hadn't moved quickly with heavy advertising
campaigns and hotel promotions. The government-funded tourist
association spent an extra 25 million Hong Kong dollars
(US$3.2 million) on promotions and advertising between June 4
and the March 31 end of the association's fiscal year. It
focused on Southeast Asia to lure short-haul visitors to
replace the Americans and Europeans who were canceling China
tours or were afraid that violence might spill into Hong
Kong.
   So far, the strategy appears to be working. Southeast
Asian visitor arrivals in the first four months of 1990
jumped 16.1% from a year earlier, according to tourist
association figures, while total visitor arrivals were down
1% from a year earlier.
   "We're actually a little ahead of our forecast on
arrivals," says Douglas King, general manager of marketing
for the association. He predicts visitor arrivals this year
will grow 8% to 10% from last year and will exceed the 1988
record.
   Such projections do little to reassure the hotel industry.
"Although visitor numbers are just behind last year, the
hotels aren't getting the same clientele as before," says Mr.
Smith of the Hilton. That's because visitors from North
America, Europe and Australia continue to stay away in large
numbers, and these visitors tend to stay in top-market
hotels, where the room glut is greatest.
   In the first four months of this year, the number of
visitors from the U.S., the colony's No. 3 source, fell 14.2%
from a year earlier. European arrivals declined 8.8%, and
arrivals from Australia fell 11.2%. The number of visitors
from Japan, the colony's No. 1 market accounting for 22.9% of
arrivals, were down only 0.3% during the period, and the
number coming from Taiwan, the No. 2 market accounting for
22.8% of arrivals, rose 1.9%.
   The problem is that those visitors who have taken up the
slack since June 4 -- mostly from Taiwan and Southeast Asia
-- are checking into two-star and three-star hotels,
preferring to save their money for shopping. Only 15.7% of
the average daily expenditure of Taiwan visitors went for
hotels, while Southeast Asians spent 28.3% on hotels. By
contrast, North Americans shelled out 47.4% of their daily
spending on hotels, Europeans spent 44.3%, and Australians
spent 36.5%.
   Hoteliers working with overseas tour directors say it
could be as late as 1992 before Americans and Europeans start
heading back to China through Hong Kong in big numbers. In
addition to their concerns about political stability in
China, Americans and Europeans are being drawn away from Asia
by new opportunities to travel in Eastern Europe.
   The Hilton's Mr. Smith expects the turnaround to come in
October 1991, the start of the annual high season for
tourism. Meanwhile, he predicts that the recently refurbished
Hilton's occupancy rate will drop this year to an average of
66% from 86% last year. The Hilton has cut its average room
rate 10% since a year ago to HK$1,150, he says, adding that
the Hilton, which takes in a mix of business travelers and
tourists, is a good indicator of general trends in the local
market.

   Manager's Journal:
   How to Crunch a Bunch of Figures

FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD)
</IN>
<LP>
   Every business manager I know shares one frustration: the
difficulty obtaining fast, accurate and comprehensive market
information. Whether selling mouthwash, disk drives or, in
our case, snack foods, a manager needs to know whether a
product is giving the competition fits, or if it's a clinker.
And you need to know quickly, or the competition will kill
you.
   Until recently, Frito-Lay had a centralized
decision-making structure common to many corporations.
Product information crept upward through the organization on
what I thought was a timely basis. I soon discovered it
wasn't timely enough.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It did not, for example, provide Frito-Lay enough time to
respond quickly to its rapidly changing and complex markets
or to fine-tune its inventory. It also did not allow us to
shorten our business cycle enough to stay ahead of the
competition. And it did not allow me, the CEO, to have the
latest sales and profit information on the 14 million snacks
sold weekly through our 400,000 sales calls.
   So we changed -- radically.
   The catalyst was our Decision Support System, brought on
line last year. DSS kicks back to 200 managers detailed sales
and inventory information fed into it by 10,000 route
salespeople equipped with hand-held computers.
   For example, one of our sales people who handles more than
50 stores for us in New Jersey no longer spends hours writing
orders, invoices and sales reports. With his palm-sized
computer, he now completes his "paper work" in a minute or
two at each stop, running through a programmed product list
complete with prices. At the end of each day, his sales
report is transmitted in seconds to headquarters in Dallas.
Even conservatively, if we estimate that our route
salespeople save just three hours a week, that's 30,000 hours
a week for the entire sales force, and untold savings in
clerical, postage and forms costs.
   Here's how the system serves us:
   -- Helps in tracking new products. In this area, DSS is
invaluable. This spring, for example, Frito-Lay launched its
new "Light" line of snack foods. DSS allows me to see if this
new line is cannibalizing other Frito-Lay brands -- and I get
the information in a matter of days, not weeks as was
previously the case. I also have easy access to data showing
our performance vs. competitive brands'. For Ruffles Light
Potato Chips, I can determine: total sales from the previous
week; supermarket sales vs. smaller accounts; average sales
on a particular route; and the success of our promotions.
Most important, the data allow me to make mid-course
corrections to ensure the success of the Light line.
   -- Facilitates faster, more accurate decisions. Recently,
I noticed red numbers (indicating reduced market share) for
tortilla chips in our central business region. I punched up
another screen display and located the problem: Texas. I kept
punching up new screens and tracked the red numbers to a
specific sales division and, finally, the chain of stores.
The numbers pinpointed the problem area and, after additional
research, revealed the culprit: the introduction of a generic
store-branded product. We quickly formulated a
counter-strategy and sales climbed again. Time invested: a
couple of weeks. Before DSS, finding such a problem and
correcting it took the better part of three months.
   Through information technology, even cardboard cartons
used to transport our products become a business opportunity.
Last year, 88% of all cartons shipped to our distribution
centers were returned by our sales force for re-use. If we
push the percentage up a single point, it saves Frito-Lay
$700,000. So, through DSS, we are now tracking cardboard
returns by individual sales route, and by store, and hope to
push returns above 90%.
   -- Assists in "management by walking around." When Tom
Peters coined that phrase he wasn't thinking of a computer
tour of operations by the CEO. But that is what DSS allows me
and other senior executives to do. I can, at a glance, view
the performance of each of our managers and salespeople
around the country. If I see something I don't like, I can
fire off an electronic-mail memo. Conversely, if there is
good news, I'm likely to contact the manager and congratulate
him.
   -- Helps us to decentralize. I never thought a computer
would be responsible for a total reorganization of Frito-Lay,
but it has been. Last year we decentralized, breaking the
company into four geographic business areas, each with its
own business plan, structure and profit-and-loss
responsibility. We did so because DSS, and the detailed
information it provides, allows middle managers to have a
complete picture of what is happening in their regions. Now
approximately 60% of the decisions that used to be made by
top management are made by regional managers, leaving the
decisions affecting the company as a whole at corporate
headquarters.
   As a result, top management can see within a few days
which products are hot and which are not, enabling it to
devise its strategy on the spot. But most important, DSS
gives us the information we need -- not what someone wants to
give us after it has been massaged and sanitized. And we get
it when we want it, which is usually immediately. While DSS
currently operates through 200 terminals, it will reach 600
managers before fall, many of them via satellite
transmission.
   A note of caution, however: When incorporating an
information technology system, do so step-by-step. Computers
as a strategic marketing tool may still be unfamiliar to
lower and middle management, and may require a breaking-in
period. Let your people feel the impact of the system, so
that as additional programs are incorporated, the process
will seem evolutionary. The results will be revolutionary.

   Noriega's Co-Defendant Pleads Guilty;
   Judge Rejects Challenges to Charges

   Manuel Noriega was hit by two legal blows when a
co-defendant pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against him
and a judge rejected a string of legal challenges to the
charges against the deposed Panamanian dictator.
   Enrique Pretelt, a Panamanian businessman and former close
associate of Mr. Noriega, pleaded guilty in federal court in
Tampa, Fla., Friday to two felony counts -- conspiring with
Mr. Noriega and attempting to import 400,000 pounds of
marijuana into the U.S. through Panama.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to several lawyers in the case -- including Mr.
Pretelt's attorney, George Tragos -- Mr. Pretelt's testimony
may bolster the U.S. government's cases against Mr. Noriega,
who faces federal drug charges in Miami and Tampa.
   "He was a close personal friend as well as a business
associate of Noriega," said Mr. Tragos of Clearwater, Fla.
"I'm sure he will be able to corroborate a lot."
   Among other things, Mr. Pretelt is said to have been
present at a meeting in Cuba that included Fidel Castro, Mr.
Noriega, and members of the Medellin, Colombia, drug cartel.
The Miami indictment alleges that at that meeting Mr. Castro
mediated a dispute between Mr. Noriega and the drug lords,
who were angry that Mr. Noriega had destroyed a
cocaine-processing plant in Panama despite having received
payments to protect it.
   Mr. Pretelt's cooperation is also expected to shore up the
prosecution's case against Mr. Noriega in Tampa where he was
the sole co-defendant.
   Defense lawyers familiar with the case have said its key
weakness was that it appeared to rely too heavily on the
expected testimony of one convicted drug smuggler -- Steven
Kalish. Samuel Buffone, Mr. Kalish's lawyer, said, "If
Pretelt would testify truthfully and accurately, he would
corroborate Mr. Kalish's story." In his plea agreement, Mr.
Pretelt said the U.S. could prove that he and Mr. Kalish
formed a business partnership with Mr. Noriega and another
drug trafficker for laundering drug money for Mr. Kalish.
   Separately, on Friday, U.S. District Judge William M.
Hoeveler, who presides over the Miami case, swept aside every
legal challenge Mr. Noriega has raised as to the legality of
the charges against him. In an 80-page order that addresses
several legal issues never before a federal court before,
Judge Hoeveler rejected a defense argument that the U.S.
lacks jurisdiction over Mr. Noriega because the alleged
crimes occurred outside the U.S.
   The judge was also unconvinced by arguments that Mr.
Noriega enjoyed immunity as Panama's ruler. He noted Mr.
Noriega was never recognized by the U.S. or the Panamanian
constitution as Panama's head of state, adding that such
immunity generally pertains to official actions. "The court
fails to see how Noriega's alleged drug trafficking and
protection of money launderers could conceivably constitute
public action taken on behalf of the Panamanian state," the
judge said.
   The judge also refused to dismiss the charges on the basis
that the U.S. invasion of Panama, which resulted in the
deaths of innocent civilians, was so outrageous it "shocked
the conscience of the court," making Mr. Noriega's arrest
illegal. He said Mr. Noriega couldn't evade drug charges
because third parties may have had their rights violated.
   The judge also declined to use his "supervisory power" to
drop the charges on the basis that the U.S. government's
actions were so vile he was required to do so. He said it was
beyond his "province to determine whether or under what
circumstances war is immoral."
   The U.S. attorney in Miami declined to comment; the U.S.
attorney in Tampa couldn't be reached. Mr. Noriega's lawyers
also couldn't be reached.

   Macy Indicates
   A Profit Decline
   For Fiscal Year

   NEW YORK -- R.H. Macy &amp; Co. earnings before interest,
taxes and depreciation will be down 20% for the fiscal year
ending July 31, according to company projections.
   The information, contained in a report that Macy disclosed
to various members of the financial community, shows that
earnings before taxes, interest and depreciation will drop to
$743.2 million from $925.9 million a year earlier. Sales are
expected to increase 6.1% to nearly $7.40 billion from about
$6.97 billion a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The profit decline reflects the retailer's disastrous
Christmas quarter, during which earnings before interest,
taxes and depreciation fell to $210 million from $391.5
million, a decrease of 46%.
   For the fourth quarter, ending July 31, Macy sales are
expected to climb about 7% to $1.70 billion from $1.59
billion a year earlier. Earnings before interest, taxes and
depreciation are expected to gain 6.7% to $166 million
against $155.6 million.
   At the same time, Macy projected an upbeat look for the 12
months ending Feb. 2, 1991. During that period the company
believes earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation
will climb 35% to $980.1 million from $726.6 million, while
sales will increase 4.1% to $7.52 billion from $7.22 billion.
   In recent weeks, several credit-related companies
tightened their policies on merchandise shipped to Macy.
   In a speech last week, Edward Finkelstein, chairman, said
there have been reports that Macy may consider the sale of
non-operating assets or an exchange offer, or seek a new
investor. "We are actively examining various opportunities to
reduce and/or refinance our debt," said Mr. Finkelstein. He
emphasized that Macy has ample liquidity to meet its
obligations.

   KOKOMO, Ind. -- The two businesses that make up General
Motors Corp.'s GM Hughes Electronics Corp. division said they
expect revenue will reach a combined $11.8 billion, up from
$11.4 billion a year ago.
   The Hughes Aircraft Co. unit said it expects 1990 revenue
to rise to about $7.5 billion from $7.4 billion a year
earlier, while GM's Delco Electronics unit projected its
revenues will reach $4.3 billion, up from $4 billion in 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hughes Aircraft President D. Kenneth Richardson said that
Hughes was projecting sales of $10 billion "in a few years."
   "In order to do so, we plan to maintain our position in
the military market, but grow rapidly in other areas," Mr.
Richardson said. "We expect the ratio of military to
non-military will change from the present 75% to 25%, to
become 60% to 40%."
   Donald J. Almquist, chairman, president and chief
executive officer of Delco Electronics, said the unit's
long-range business plan calls for sales of more than $6
billion in 1995.
   Although GM car sales have been dropping in recent years,
Mr. Almquist said Delco Electronics sales have been rising
"because of the rapidly increasing electronic content in
motor vehicles and because of increasing sales to non-GM
customers."
   Today the average electronic content per GM North American
vehicle is about $650. Mr. Almquist said that average could
reach $1,500 by 1995.
   Officials from the two GM Hughes operations made their
projections during a media tour of Delco Electronics'
facilities. Delco also announced it formed a research and
development program to work on vehicle communications systems
with a unit of Hughes Aircraft. Delco said it expects the
first products from the new program to be cellular-based
equipment being developed with Motorola Inc.
