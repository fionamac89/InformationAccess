   Navy Plans to Buy Northrop Jet Parts
   Despite Unit's Falsification of Test Data

   The Navy plans to buy $300,000 of crucial AV-8B Harrier
jet parts from Northrop Corp., even though the division that
makes the parts has been suspended from Pentagon contracting
for falsifying test data on the program.
   "A procurement system in which the Navy is forced to
obtain parts from a corporate criminal is intolerable," said
Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.), chairman of the House
Government Operations subcommittee on legislation and
national security, which held a hearing on the matter
yesterday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Navy maintained that suspending the waiver is required
to keep the Harrier fleet flying. Already, four of the jets
have been taken out of service because of a shortage of
replacement parts, and 18 could be down within a year if the
parts aren't available, the subcommittee was told. Some of
the Pentagon's 200 Harriers are being flown by the Marines in
the Persian Gulf.
   The Defense Department is not out "to cheat the
taxpayers," Col. James Hart, program manager on the AV-8B,
assured lawmakers. But without a qualified second source,
Northrop is the only short-term supplier of the spares, and
going elsewhere could take as long as two years and cost more
than $1 million, he said.
   The officer alleged that "Northrop has cheated all of us,
but most of all the young Marines" who require their aircraft
to perform flawlessly. There is no doubt, he said, that "the
reliability of the system would have been improved" had
Northrop conducted tests properly.
   A Northrop spokesman in Los Angeles reiterated that the
company has fired the employees who falsified testing, and
that the parts now meet all specifications. "People are
trying to smear the whole corporation for the acts of a
handful of people," the spokesman added.
   The devices in question, known as rate sensor assemblies,
are used in systems that help stabilize the vertical-takeoff
Harriers, especially while hovering. The parts -- "vital to
safety of flight," according to an internal Navy memo -- have
lasted an average 999 flight hours instead of the 1,525 hours
intended.
   Last February, Northrop pleaded guilty to falsifying test
results on the Harrier program. One test completely omitted,
according to subcommittee investigators, was for
life-expectancy of the devices.
   An angry Rep. Conyers complained that going back to
Northrop for more parts "looks like business as usual" for
the company, and he vowed to press Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney to "personally ensure that Northrop does not make a
dime off this forced procurement."
   Asked about this, the Northrop spokesman countered: "If
you get a contract, you ought to make a profit on it."
   Subcommittee members also were exasperated that Northrop
declined to testify yesterday. "It goes without saying that
until Northrop is prepared to be forthcoming. . . . I will be
reluctant to support any payment of U.S. taxpayer dollars to
this contractor," fumed Rep. Frank Horton (R., N.Y.).
   Lawmakers also said that McDonnell Douglas Corp., the
AV-8B prime contractor, and Honeywell Inc., maker of the
system containing the sensor assemblies, didn't cooperate.
   The Air Force also was supposed to address the hearing on
the reliability of the nuclear-tipped cruise missile, which
contains a Northrop-built guidance unit identified as having
problems operating in subzero weather. But Jack Jones, an Air
Force engineering supervisor, appeared with only a short
statement saying the guidance unit hadn't ever caused an
operational test-flight failure. This, however, is
contradicted by documentation previously disclosed by this
newspaper.
   Rep. Conyers ordered Mr. Jones to appear at another
hearing to be held soon, and to be better prepared. "He
thought he'd come out here and stonewall us," Rep. Conyers
asserted, adding: "There was no point in even taking his
testimony because it amounted to nothing."

   AN AIR FORCE engineering supervisor's statement before a
House subcommittee -- that a Northrop Corp. cruise missile
guidance component hasn't ever caused an operational
test-flight failure -- was contradicted by documentation
previously disclosed in The Wall Street Journal. Because of a
typographical error in yesterday's edition, the contradictory
nature of the statement wasn't indicated.

   SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- In the 1960s, there were protest
rallies over the Vietnam War, civil rights, farm workers and
other important issues.
   Social activism has taken a different turn in the 1990s: A
dating service organized a protest rally here against a
bank's advertising campaign.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It all started when Jeffrey Ullman, president of Great
Expectations, a large video-dating service, was driving on
the freeway behind a bus. On the back of the bus, an ad for
Santa Monica Bank said: "WE HANDLE MORE ZEROS THAN A DATING
SERVICE."
   "I was so shocked I almost ran off the road," says Mr.
Ullman. "I got on my car phone and I called the bank. I was
offended." He was transferred to Pat Robertson, a vice
president of Team One, the advertising division of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi that dreamed up the line. "She laughed it off,"
recalls Mr. Ullman. "She said it was a whimsical campaign."
   The ad agency isn't laughing now. At Mr. Ullman's protest
yesterday in front of the bank, only 21 protesters showed up,
but so did reporters and television cameras. Picketers
carried signs that said: "Santa Monica Bank thinks singles
are zeros. Reduce your balance to zero."
   "I don't consider myself a zero," says Corinne Balzac, a
crisis counselor, who attended the rally. "I take offense at
the ads." Brian Baker, a sales engineer at the rally, said:
"The implication is that anyone who belongs to a dating
service is a zero. If I had an account at the bank, I would
close it."
   Bank officials didn't return calls. Ms. Robertson brands
the rally a publicity stunt: "Mr. Ullman told me he was going
to seize the moment and turn this to his advantage. We
certainly didn't mean to demean any organization or person."
   So what did the agency mean by zeros? "We all have dates,
myself included, that aren't love connections," she says. "We
were playing off the zero as a double entendre -- cash zeros
and a zero that doesn't connect in a dating sense."
   Ms. Robertson says the bank won't buckle to protesters.
She says the monthly ad campaign will change as scheduled, on
Oct. 1, to: "MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES. JUST AT OUR
BRANCHES." Past slogans included, "MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING.
(YEAH, RIGHT.)" and "WE SELL CDS DOWN BY THE SEASHORE."

   Lowering Interest Rates

   Declaring that the Federal Reserve's "anti-inflationary
resolve is being tested," Fed board member Wayne Angell said
the central bank shouldn't lower interest rates now.
   Acknowledging the mounting pressure on the Fed to ease its
grip on credit amid signs of a weakening economy, Mr. Angell
warned that "hard-fought gains against inflationary
psychology achieved in the 1980s could be lost" if the Fed
moves prematurely.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Angell's views aren't shared by all of his colleagues
at the Fed. The Fed hasn't moved interest rates since July,
and Mr. Angell was among a minority who argued against even
leaning toward lower interest rates when the Fed's
policy-making committee met in August. The committee meets
again Tuesday.
   The Fed governor stressed, as Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
did last week, that the Fed can't prevent the pain that
higher oil prices will cause. "Attempting, through an easing
of policy, to somehow avoid or postpone the . . . adjustments
of the oil shock would only serve to undermine" the
credibility of the Fed's pledge to bring down the inflation
rate and risk a deeper recession in the future, Mr. Angell
said.
   Mr. Angell indicated he would advocate that the Fed nudge
down the short-term interest rates it influences if the price
of gold and commodities fell, long-term interest rates
dropped and the dollar's value rose -- all signs that markets
foresee a weaker economy and less inflation. Those indicators
currently are going the other direction, suggesting that the
economy may not be as weak as some fear, Mr. Angell said.

   BRUSSELS -- The European Community's energy commissioner,
Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, warned against further rises in oil
prices and called the recent surge "totally unjustified and
indefensible."
   Mr. Cardoso e Cunha accused traders of speculating "at the
expense of the consumers." He said oil stocks remain at
unusually high levels, despite the Persian Gulf crisis, a
fact known by "everyone on the market."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He also disputed the perception that a Gulf war would
result in oil shortages. "The speculators should remind
themselves that both countries continued to produce and
export oil throughout the Iran-Iraq war, despite repeated
attacks on their oil facilities," he said, and predicted that
markets would soon realize this, leaving companies and
traders holding high-priced oil to face big losses. "They
will deserve no public sympathy," he said. "But in the
meantime, we are all suffering from their misguided actions."
   The International Energy Agency on Friday is to discuss
oil stocks, but the EC commission isn't viewed as likely to
recommend releasing strategic stocks to push prices down.

   Mortgage Value

   Denver postal worker Patricia Louise Brouse wouldn't seem
the type to strike terror in the hearts of mortgage lenders.
   Hardly a Donald Trump-class borrower, she filed for
bankruptcy-law protection a year ago, listing modest first
and second mortgages as her biggest debts. Her home was worth
only half as much as the total of her mortgages, but not even
that sad legacy of Denver's housing crash was particularly
alarming to lenders. Thanks to a hands-off tradition in
bankruptcy court, mortgage companies usually dictate the
terms: our money or your house.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Ms. Brouse's attorney had other ideas. "If the lender
makes a stupid loan, why shouldn't he pay for it?" asked
Harold Baer Jr. To the horror of the mortgage lenders, the
judge agreed to reduce Ms. Brouse's mortgage balances to the
value of her home, slashing them from $54,000 to $27,120.
   Thrift crisis, credit crunch, glutted markets . . . now
add "cramdowns" to the list of plagues on the house of real
estate. Cramdowns, court-imposed reductions of loan balances,
have long been an unpleasant fact of life in bankruptcy court
for commercial lenders and installment-loan companies. Now,
judges in Chapter 13 cases, in which wage earners' debts are
restructured, are chopping home loans down to the current
value of the home. The remainder is converted into unsecured
debt, much to the chagrin of lenders, who typically collect
less than 10 cents on the dollar on unsecured loans in
personal bankruptcy proceedings.
   Since the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a cramdown
in an Oregon case last October, courts in Pennsylvania,
Montana, Oklahoma and Colorado have approved cramdowns. The
3rd Circuit Court of Appeals also upheld the Pennsylvania
cramdown decision. Perhaps an additional 300 cases are
pending from New Jersey to Alaska.
   The burgeoning caseload is sending shock waves through the
mortgage industry, already reeling from slumping home sales.
"It's going to be a tidal wave," predicts Michael S. Polk, a
Los Angeles attorney who represents lenders. "What we are
seeing is the beginning of a monster."
   How fearsome it becomes depends on how deeply the housing
recession bites. In 1985, the depths of the Texas housing
bust, the prices of Houston homes dropped so precipitously
that mortgage lenders faced an average $20,000 loss on each
home they sold out of foreclosure. They took to suing
homeowners to collect the deficiency -- and to discourage
them from moving away and mailing their housekeys to the
lender.
   "If we were to have a Houston in Los Angeles, there would
be a proliferation of these cases," says James M. Wooten,
chairman of Lomas Mortgage USA, a Dallas mortgage bank. "It
would be a heavy challenge for everyone involved in housing
finance."
   A cramdown epidemic would be a bigger blow to the
beleaguered thrifts and mortgage banks than the seige of
foreclosures in the Southwest. There, mortgage insurance
policies issued by the Veterans Administration, Federal
Housing Administration and private companies made full
repayments to lenders, or came close, on the low-down-payment
loans that represented the greatest risk of default.
   So far, these insurers are ducking the tab for cramdowns.
Only defaults can trigger FHA claims, says a spokesman for
the insurer, and a cramdown is not a default. If the note is
called after a cramdown, he adds, the FHA will cover only the
adjusted balance.
   The sophisticated secondary market for mortgage debt
represents another minefield for thrifts and mortgage banks.
Most home loan mortgages are purchased by quasi-public
agencies, which in turn sell securities to the public that
are backed by pools of those loans. Lenders worry that these
loans might be considered "impaired" and they could be forced
to repurchase them and swallow the losses.
   Contracts with these agencies -- the Government National
Mortgage Association, the Federal National Mortgage
Association, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. -- all
require mortgage originators to repurchase "impaired" loans,
although there's been no test yet of whether cramdowns would
qualify. "If a judge says the loan is only worth 80 cents,"
asks William E. Cumberland, general counsel for the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America, "where does the other 20
cents come from? The system isn't designed to cope with
forgiveness of debt."
   Lenders' attorneys are painting a stark picture of a
collapse in mortgage lending in their arguments against
cramdowns, contending that they will lead inevitably to
tougher underwriting standards and higher interest rates.
After an outbreak of cramdowns in a depressed regional
economy, "you're going to wind up with the big R word --
redlining," says Mr. Polk. "What upsets me most is that the
loans most vulnerable to this are the ones designed for
first-time home buyers."
   To those who witnessed the wreckage caused by overbuilding
in the Southwest, making mortgage loans harder to get doesn't
sound like such a bad idea. "This is the other side of the
S&amp;L scam," says Mr. Baer, the Denver attorney. "If lenders
had had some risk, we wouldn't have condos all over Colorado
that shouldn't have been built."
   But in the midst of a credit crunch, lenders trying to
make a buck don't see it that way. "The lender isn't party to
an investment strategy," argues Mark A. Farmer, a lender's
attorney in Oklahoma City who has appealed two cramdown
verdicts imposed on his client, Local Federal Savings of
Oklahoma City. "Have you ever heard of a lender sharing in
the appreciation of property?"
   Lenders hope that vigorous defenses will discourage
debtors' attorneys, since there is limited cash available for
their fees in most personal bankruptcy cases. Mr. Polk also
counsels his lenders to keep watch on mortgages that have
been reduced in cramdowns. Since Chapter 13 settlements
aren't official until the schedule of payments is completed
several years later, lenders may be able to reinstate the
original mortgage if the debtor defaults a second time.
   Critics of cramdowns point out that subsequent defaults
are possible because debtors' monthly mortgage payments can't
be reduced. The bankruptcy act specifically prohibits courts
from changing the terms of loans secured by the debtor's
home.
   For Lori Anne Meyer of Mustang, Okla., the cramdown she is
seeking wouldn't shrink the onerous monthly payments that
helped drive her into Chapter 13. But if the judge approves
her petition her $41,000 mortgage would be cut by a fourth at
least, bringing her that much closer to repayment -- and
that's good enough for her. "I have made this my home," she
says. "I want to keep it."
   Court setbacks have mortgage lenders grumbling about
seeking relief from Congress. If Congress left a loophole in
the 1979 bankruptcy law, says Lomas's Mr. Wooten, "I don't
know any other solution for it than to seek an amendment."
But he hopes instead that cramdowns won't turn into an
epidemic.
   Don't bet on it. Cramdowns took off in Oklahoma City only
this summer, says debtors' attorney Melinda Monnet, but
already her colleagues at the bar are explaining the process
in solicitation letters to homeowners whose homes have been
posted for foreclosure.

   WASHINGTON -- Smokers of all ages experience immediate and
substantial health benefits when they quit, the U.S. surgeon
general reported in her latest report on smoking and health.
   Twenty previous reports from the Public Health Service
have focused on the dangers of smoking, but Surgeon General
Antonia Novello said she decided to focus on the benefits of
giving up smoking in order to stress the point that "it's
never too late to quit smoking."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Persons who quit smoking before age 50 have one-half the
risk of dying in the next 15 years compared with continuing
smokers," Dr. Novello said. The risk of coronary heart
disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S., falls by
half within one year of the cessation of smoking, according
to the report.
   Many smokers fear that they'll gain weight if they quit.
The report said, however, that weight gain averages only five
pounds, and that the risk from the additional weight is far
less than that of continuing to smoke.

   MCA's Allure to Matsushita Lifts Stakes
   In Japanese Firms' Entertainment Aims

   TOKYO -- Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s interest in
buying MCA Inc., parent of Universal Studios, raises the
stakes as Japanese electronics companies scramble to get into
the entertainment industry.
   In particular, the talks intensify Matsushita's rivalry
with Sony Corp., which last year purchased Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. for $5 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Matsushita officials confirmed yesterday that they are
talking to MCA, based in Universal City, Calif., but said no
decisions have been made. "There have been various talks of
this nature regarding mergers and acquisitions, but nothing
has materialized as of today," a Matsushita spokesman said.
But he added that movies, television programming, books,
records and other forms of so-called entertainment software
make up "a field that will be increasingly important in the
future."
   The disclosure comes at a time when Japanese companies
once again have begun making news with high-profile direct
investments in the U.S. Eyebrows were raised in some quarters
this month about Minoru Isutani, a Japanese golf course
developer, being behind the acquisition of the famous Pebble
Beach golf resort in California for an estimated $800 million
to $1 billion.
   After Sony's acquisition of Columbia and Mitsubishi Estate
Co.'s purchase of a 51% stake in Rockefeller Center in New
York City touched off a public outcry in the U.S., Japanese
companies appeared to steer away from such so-called trophy
purchases. Some Japanese officials and pundits warned of a
serious political backlash in the U.S. if Japanese companies
continued to buy culturally prized American properties.
   Though Matsushita has been rumored previously to be
shopping around for a studio, its interest in MCA may be a
signal of change in the company, analysts said. Some analysts
have been concerned that the company has been struggling for
direction since the death last year of Konosuke Matsushita,
its legendary founder.
   Sony's success in selling compact disk players, after the
acquisition of CBS Records, has made it clear that a
company's ability to produce its own entertainment software,
the music in this case, can help push sales of companion
hardware.
   "If they Matsushita don't get into software, they will
be at the end of their rope very soon," Boris Petersik, an
analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities (Japan), said.
   Matsushita's traditional strategy has been to watch for
Sony innovations, then rush out similar products within
months at lower prices. But this strategy appears to have
become more difficult recently. After Sony launched a
"passport sized" video camcorder in June last year, it took
other makers, including Matsushita, a year to come up with
competitive products.
   Matsushita's camcorder, which is slightly bigger than
Sony's, adds a so-called fuzzy-logic computer chip that
minimizes shaking in the recorded image. But before
Matsushita's product went on sale, Sony had sold more than
one million camcorders, grabbing a 30% share of the world
camcorder market and 60% of the Japanese market, according to
Sony.
   Now, instead of following other makers, Matsushita is
striving to become a leading marketer of high-definition
television, the next major advance in audio-visual equipment,
expected to go on sale next year. Industry observers estimate
the high-quality television sets could create a 14.5 trillion
yen ($105.6 billion) market in the next 10 years.
   "They're not going to get left behind," Barry Dargan, an
analyst with James Capel Securities Ltd., said. "What they
want to do is become an innovator." And having access to
entertainment software would support sales of Matsushita's
equipment, he said.
   Other Japanese electronics companies also have been eager
to acquire their own library of software. Pioneer Electronic
Corp.'s subsidiary in May purchased a 10% stake in Los
Angeles-based Carolco Pictures Inc. for $60 million. Pioneer
hopes to market Carolco's films, including "Rambo" and
"Terminator," for its laser disk machines. Other electronics
makers, such as Sanyo Electric Co. and Sharp Corp., said they
don't have specific plans, but they emphasize the important
role of software.
   Even companies outside the industry have ventured into the
U.S. entertainment sector, though on a much smaller scale.
Trading houses, such as Sumitomo Corp. and Marubeni Corp.,
and leasing companies, such as Orix Corp., have invested in
Hollywood movies, hoping to cash in on the growing
videocassette and cable-television market in Japan.
   A deal with MCA would heighten Matsushita's efforts to
promote an international corporate image. Answering U.S.
criticism that Japanese companies weren't importing enough
products, Matsushita earlier this year opened a 60-store
shopping mall packed with clothes, stationery and food
imported from the U.S. and Europe. The company expects to
post sales of six billion yen from the stores in the first
year.
   Matsushita's 51%-owned Victor Co. of Japan unit last year
formed a joint venture with the Hollywood producer Lawrence
Gordon, and the U.S. venture plans to release its first film,
"Point Break," early next year.

   PARIS -- France's unemployment rate held steady at 8.9% in
August, according to seasonally adjusted data published by
the Labor Ministry.
   The steady rate represents the third consecutive month in

   Collagen Says Delay
   Of Spinoff to Hurt
   First-Half Earnings

<LP>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Collagen Corp. said a one-quarter
delay in the planned spinoff of a unit will reduce by half
the profit it expects to report in the first half of its
fiscal 1991 year.
   That indicates profit for the biomedical concern will
likely fall in the range of $1 million, or 10 cents to 12
cents a share, for the first half ending Dec. 31, down from
about $2 million, or 23 cents a share, reported for last
year's first half.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   James T. McKinley, senior vice president and chief
financial officer, said it is impossible to forecast the
bottom line precisely at this point. But he added he expects
profit in the fiscal first and second quarters to be roughly
equal, and isn't projecting a loss in either period.
   Howard D. Palefsky, president and chief executive officer,
said that postponing the spinoff of Collagen's Celtrix unit
from October 1990 to early in 1991, will add an additional
quarter's operating expenses -- or about $1.5 to $2 million
-- to Collagen's costs.
   As reported earlier this week, the delay is the result of
a landlord's refusal to waive financial covenants contained
in a sale-leaseback agreement covering Collagen's Fremont,
Calif., manufacturing facility. Collagen says the agreement
expires at the end of the year, and it plans to renegotiate
terms to permit the spinoff.
   Despite the short-term strain on profit, Mr. Palefsky
stressed that the spinoff should help Collagen sharpen its
focus on its core businesses: injectible collagen for skin
implants, dental business and its target therapies
subsidiary. Mr. McKinley said he expects product sales from
those continuing businesses should grow 25% to 35% in the
fiscal first half, adding that these improvements "will
become more apparent as we focus on fewer things."
   Divesting itself of Celtrix was necessary, not only
because its focus on pharmaceutical research diverged from
Collagen's core business, but also because financing such
research "is beyond our current cash flow and equity base,"
he added.
   "We do expect a relatively short-term effect" on earnings
from the delayed spinoff, Mr. Mckinley said, "but we feel
it's the right move move for us, and the benefits will become
more apparent over time."

   Management:
   Companies With Hostages in Persian Gulf
   Struggle to Help Stateside Families Cope

   U.S. energy companies have contingency plans for all
mannner of oil-industry mishaps -- well blowouts, refinery
fires, even Gulf of Mexico hurricanes.
   But since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, U.S. companies with
workers caught in the Persian Gulf have had to grapple not
only with frozen operations and assets, but also with helping
stateside families and colleagues cope.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And that chapter isn't in their crisis management manuals.
   "We didn't know anything" about helping dependents,
concedes T.B. O'Brien, president of O'Brien-Goins-Simpson
Inc., whose OGE Drilling Inc. unit has six workers missing.
In 11 years of business in Kuwait, "this is the first time we
ever had this kind of thing happen," he says.
   Baker Hughes Inc., too, admits being caught unawares.
"None of us anticipated this happening," says Phil Rice, vice
president of human resources for the oil-field service
company. Baker Hughes, like nearly all the industry, says the
government asked it not to give specifics on the Middle East
crisis. On State Department advice, a spokesman answers "two
or three" when asked how many Baker Hughes workers are being
held.
   Companies are learning on the fly what families of
hostages need. So far, everything falls into one or another
of three categories: Families want a steady stream of
reliable information, readily available psychological
support, and assurances that salaries and benefits are
sacrosanct.
   Such moves don't just reassure the distraught, management
consultants say. They could also stave off lawsuits and help
temper the industry's profiteering image. Wrong moves, they
warn, could make already scarce energy workers hesitant to
take future assignments in the Persian Gulf. Either way, what
companies do now will affect their businesses and reputations
long after the current crisis is over.
   "People will be looking," says Robert Bies, associate
professor of management at Georgetown University. "This is
when the character of the company is tested" and the company
is expected to show loyalty and commitment to its workers and
their families.
   That doesn't mean the kind of derring-do that led
billionaire H. Ross Perot to hire commandos in 1979 to rescue
two Electronic Data Systems workers held in Iran. Instead,
consultants say, companies should stick with giving
information, psychological help and financial support, no
matter how prosaic that may seem compared with Mr. Perot's
exploits.
   Information tops the list. "Keep the families informed,"
says Donna Niehous of Toledo, Ohio. "Level with them. There's
no greater thing {companies} can do." Mrs. Niehous knows
first-hand what families of hostages need. Her husband,
William, now retired, was held by terrorists in Venezuela for
40 months in the late 1970s when he was an executive with
Owens-Illinois Co.
   Consultants echo her advice. "Family members need to
know," says Mr. Bies of Georgetown. "They are feeling a great
deal of helplessness. The company can stem the tide from
moving into hopelessness."
   Many companies set up 24-hour hotlines after the Iraqi
invasion. Santa Fe International Corp., a Kuwait Petroleum
Corp. unit with eight oil-field workers held in Baghdad, says
its human resource department provides information to
families and company employees. Bechtel Group Inc., the
engineering and construction giant, established a world-wide,
toll-free phone network.
   Because companies can tell families only what they
themselves have been able to find out, some staff members may
have to be assigned to gather information from government
agencies and news sources.
   Chevron Corp., for instance, has an employee in
Washington, D.C., who checks in with the State Department
several times a day and prepares updates for Chevron's
hotline.
   A good communications network is the cornerstone of the
psychological support a company can provide, consultants say.
Calling the company, even when there's nothing new to learn,
can be reassuring.
   Psychologist Harry Levinson, president of a Belmont,
Mass., management consulting firm, says company officials
should also help families with their everyday needs,
maintaining a sense of normalcy wherever possible. "They
ought to help the family adapt to whatever they might need
to," Mr. Levinson says. For instance, he says, if a hostage's
dependent is about to enroll in college, the company should
assist with those arrangements.
   Most consultants say the go-between should be someone from
the company's employee assistance program or the human
resource department because those staff members are trained
to handle other people's problems. Nonetheless, some top
executives have taken on the role during the current Mideast
conflict.
   Gordon Anderson, president of Santa Fe International's
drilling unit, and Joe Boyd, vice president of personnel,
flew from their Alhambra, Calif., headquarters to Texas to
reassure families after the invasion. In Fort Worth, they
rented a car and drove 75 miles to tiny Jacksboro to visit
Marjorie Walterscheid, whose husband Rainard, a Santa Fe
Drilling supervisor, was captured by Iraqis.
   The two California executives spent an hour with Mrs.
Walterscheid and her 10-year-old daughter Raina, offering
extra financial help and their home phone numbers before
leaving to visit other families in Texas and Louisiana.
   "They certainly didn't have to come here," Mrs.
Walterscheid says. "They did it because they care."
   But some management experts wonder how practical it is to
have top executives make face-to-face contacts. During a
crisis, "do you put your CEO on tour?" asks Brian Jenkins, a
managing director of Kroll Associates, an international
investigative and consulting firm.
   Emotional stress brought on by the crisis may require
hiring additional counselors and making them available around
the clock to families and employees. After one of its
chemical engineers escaped from Kuwait, Chevron had the human
resources staff member who had been working with the
engineer's family meet him at the airport. Now that he's
home, the company is offering him counseling.
   Almost all the companies with workers in the Mideast say
they will pay the salaries and benefits of detained workers
to their dependents. Chevron and Santa Fe International are
two of several that have even offered extra financial help,
usually through salary advances.
   Not every company has the financial wherewithal to keep
idled workers on the payroll, however. O'Brien-Goins prompted
a public outcry when it said it would have to stop paying six
missing OGE Drilling workers or risk going out of business in
months. OGE Drilling's sole business is working Kuwait oil
fields.
   It has all been worked out now -- OGE Drilling managed one
more month's pay and medical benefits until February, and a
group of 13 energy companies and the Kuwaiti
government-in-exile agreed to pay the rest. But O'Brien-Goins
learned the hard way that, in the public's eye, even
impending bankruptcy isn't reason enough to abandon the
families of hostages.
   The families say having the salaries and benefits
guaranteed is a heavy weight off their shoulders. "Now I can
spend my time and energy worrying about my son and my
husband," said Donnita Cole of Odessa, Texas. Her son has
been deployed to Saudi Arabia with the U.S. Army. Her
husband, an OGE Drilling employee, is a hostage in Iraq.
   Santa Fe International, the unit of Kuwait's national oil
company, knows it has a lot to lose if experienced workers
balk at going back to Mideast jobs once the crisis is over.
That's why the company's goodwill rounds since the invasion
have included families of hostages who work for other
companies. Santa Fe officials have telephoned these families
and offered whatever assistance and information they could.
   "We're not drawing the line," John J. Mika, vice president
of administration, says. "At times like these, you don't draw
lines."

   Child Deaths
   From AIDS

   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome will become a major
killer of children by the year 2000, offsetting some of the
recent global reduction in child mortality rates, the World
Health Organization reported.
   By the end of the century, 10 million or more children
will have contracted the AIDS virus, and most will have died,
the WHO estimated in a new report. In some parts of
sub-Sahara Africa, where AIDS is particularly prevalent,
deaths for pediatric AIDS may boost the child mortality rate
by as much as 50%, the Geneva-based agency warned.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Over the last decade, some 700,000 AIDS-infected babies
have been born around the world, but the number is expected
to expand rapidly. In most countries, but not the U.S.,
heterosexual intercourse is becoming the primary method of
transmitting the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes
AIDS. The WHO also estimates that 15 million to 20 million
adults will have been infected by HIV by the year 2000.
   The WHO issued the report, its first on pediatric AIDS, as
world leaders are preparing to meet at the United Nations
this weekend for the world summit on children. Michael
Merson, director of the WHO's AIDS program, said the report
is designed to call attention to a growing health and welfare
problem that must be addressed by world leaders.
   Not only will many children die of AIDS, but millions who
aren't HIV-infected will be orphaned as their parents die of
AIDS. "We have to plan for the implications of this," Dr.
Merson said. "This is going to be a burden on society. There
are going to be big economic and welfare implications."
Because there is no cure for AIDS, the only way to combat the
epidemic is stronger programs to reduce the sexual
transmission of AIDS.
   Over the last decade, expanded childhood immunization
programs have significantly reduced mortality from such
diseases as diphtheria, measles, polio, tetanus and
tuberculosis. "Now because of AIDS, we fear this progress
will be reversed," said Hiroshi Nakajima, director-general of
the WHO.

   Neil Bush Should Have Disclosed Ties,
   Thrift's Ex-Aide Suggests at Hearings

   DENVER -- The former chief lending officer at the failed
Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association suggested that
Neil Bush should have told the thrift more about his ties to
a business partner for whom he tried to arrange a line of
credit.
   However, the former lending officer, Russell Murray, said
information that Mr. Bush didn't disclose in another instance
involving the same business partner wouldn't have made any
difference in the thrift's action. In both cases, federal
regulators have criticized the actions of Mr. Bush, the
president's son.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Murray was testifying under subpoena in the first day
of the hearings on regulators' administrative charges that
Mr. Bush didn't adequately disclose conflicts of interest
while an outside director of Silverado from August 1985 to
August 1988. Denver-based Silverado was taken over by the
government in December 1988 at an expected cost to taxpayers
of $1 billion.
   At yesterday's hearings, former Silverado Chairman Michael
Wise appeared under subpoena but asserted his Fifth Amendment
rights against self-incrimination 14 times, refusing to
answer any questions. Mr. Wise, a prominent figure in the
thrift industry during the 1980s, recruited Mr. Bush as a
director. Mr. Bush and Mr. Wise were among 12 officials of
Silverado or its holding company who were charged last week
in a separate $200 million civil lawsuit by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. alleging "gross negligence" in
operating the thrift.
   Mr. Murray, questioned about a $900,000 line of credit Mr.
Bush sought in 1986 for an Argentinian oil and gas
exploration business of Mr. Bush and business partner Kenneth
Good, said he would have turned to Silverado's attorneys for
an opinion if he had known the full extent of the business
ties between Messrs. Bush and Good.
   "I would have contacted counsel to determine if the
transaction would have been prohibited," Mr. Murray
testified. The administrative case brought by the Office of
Thrift Supervision maintains that the transaction would have
been prohibited because of restrictions on loans to thrift
employees.
   Mr. Bush and his attorneys have argued that the line of
credit wasn't prohibited because the business, which was
controlled by Mr. Good, never intended to draw on it. Rather,
they say, Mr. Good wanted the promise of credit only to prove
financial strength to the government of Argentina. Though Mr.
Bush sought the line of credit from Silverado, he abstained
from voting on it and other matters involving Mr. Good, and
the line of credit was never granted, Mr. Bush and his
attorneys have noted.
   On another matter, Mr. Murray's testimony appeared to
support Mr. Bush's case. The OTS has charged that Mr. Bush
breached his duty to Silverado by not disclosing that Mr.
Good had an option to inject $3 million into Mr. Bush's oil
company at the same time Silverado's board voted to allow Mr.
Good to pay only $3 million to Silverado to release more than
$11.5 million in collateral. Silverado lost more than $13
million on the restructured loans to Mr. Good, the government
said.
   But Mr. Murray said that Mr. Good was in no position to
exercise that option, and that it wouldn't have made any
difference if Mr. Bush had disclosed this arrangement.
Silverado investigated Mr. Good's financial condition
thoroughly, Mr. Murray said, and "we came to the conclusion
that his ability to pay any money to anyone was suspect."
   Testimony in the hearings is expected to last until
tomorrow. Mr. Bush, who is scheduled to be the last of 11
witnesses, didn't attend yesterday's session at the federal
courthouse here.
   The OTS is seeking a so-called cease and desist sanction,
a light punishment that would bar Mr. Bush from breaking
conflict-of-interest regulations in the future.

   WASHINGTON -- The British publisher Robert Maxwell said he
is organizing a $250 million venture-capital fund to make
equity and related investments in emerging businesses in
Eastern Europe.
   Mr. Maxwell, chairman and chief executive officer of
Maxwell Communication Corp., said that he will commit $52
million to the fund, and that New York-based Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., which is handling the private placement, will commit $5
million.

   Mr. Maxwell said he is having "serious discussions" about
possible investments in Eastern Europe. In Moscow, for
example, he said, "We have been offered a major building that
needs completing" for use by Western companies that can pay
rent in foreign currency. And he said, "Newsprint mills in
certain European countries need modernization, and are
willing to pay in newsprint. There's clearly a demand for
newsprint."
   Mr. Maxwell said he will be the general partner of the
fund, which will provide not only investments but "know-how"
to Eastern European ventures in which the fund takes a
minority stake. He said he hopes the fund will "get off the
ground in the next few weeks."
   He called the $250 million sum "a beginning. Obviously, if
we are successful, it could go substantially bigger. They in
Eastern Europe need to privatize all their firms in order to
join the free-market economy."

   Trump Bankers
   Expected to Seek
   Shuttle Pay Cuts

   Donald Trump's bankers are expected to demand today that
he slash salaries and institute layoffs at the Trump Shuttle
in exchange for keeping control of the airline.
   The demands come on the heels of disclosures that Mr.
Trump won't be able to make interest payments on the $245
million in unsecured shuttle debt he is required to make
under last month's $65 million bank bailout. Mr. Trump
borrowed $380 million to purchase the airline from Eastern
Airlines in 1989 and has already missed a $1.1 million
interest payment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You've heard about what happened at the New York Post?"
asked one banker, referring to the 20% salary cut employees
of that paper agreed to recently. "Well Trump can do the same
thing."
   Mr. Trump couldn't be reached to comment.
   About 20 of Mr. Trump's creditors who hold pieces of the
$245 million loan plan to meet with Mr. Trump at the offices
of the law firm of Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges, which has
represented Citibank throughout the Trump restructuring
talks. The Citicorp unit was the lead lender for the $245
million unsecured loan, as well as an additional $135 million
Trump Shuttle equity loan. The bank subsequently sold off
most of its shuttle debt, and now is believed to hold only
about 15% of the unsecured debt.
   Citibank has emerged as a conciliatory force in
negotiations with other Trump lenders, largely because it has
the most to lose in the event Mr. Trump cedes control of his
assets. As part of the bailout, Citibank received second and
third mortgages on many Trump assets; should he lose them to
other creditors, Citibank's chances of recovering its losses
would be greatly diminished. Including the shuttle, Citibank
lent Mr. Trump a total of $1.1 billion.
   Some of the shuttle lending group, which includes Fuji
Bank, Bank of Tokyo, Natwest, and Bank of America, were
startled to hear about Mr. Trump's restructuring plans last
week, only weeks after Mr. Trump personally assured them the
debts would continue to be paid.
   Meanwhile, America West Airline's plans to purchase both
new planes and the Pan Am Shuttle, which competes with the
Trump Shuttle, are believed by bankers to be another setback
for Mr. Trump. If it closes on its purchase of the Pan Am
Shuttle, America West will most likely be able to use its
Boeing 737s for the shuttle, which are more modern than the
727s used by both Pan Am and the Trump Shuttle.

   UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. -- Western Union Corp., a
financial services and communications company, said it
extended to Oct. 9 its offer to swap new notes and common
shares for two issues of senior notes.
   The exchange offer, which is an integral part of Western
Union's recapitalization plan, had been scheduled to expire
last Monday, when note holders had tendered $348.1 million of
the $500 million of 19.25% notes outstanding and $1.4 million
of the $30 million of 16% notes outstanding.

   NEW YORK -- Inspiration Resources Corp., a natural
resources company, said it will have a $16.5 million non-cash
charge in the third quarter related to the previously
announced plan to close operations of an offshore gold mining
vessel in Alaska, Western Gold Exploration &amp; Mining Co.
   Inspiration holds a 50% interest in the venture. Though
the charge reduced Inspiration's equity investment to zero,
Western Gold's net assets at Sept. 30 are expected to total
about $40 million.

   The end is nigh. October 1 is the day. We know this
because all around Washington politicians have begun to wear
sandwich boards announcing that if the budget summit doesn't
yield up an "agreement" by next Monday, the hellfire of
"sequester" will rain down upon us all.
   "We are 10 days from Armageddon," said Minnesota
Republican William Frenzel last Friday. Picking up Darman's
Book of Revelation, Wisconsin Republican Steve Gunderson said
on Monday, "Seven days to Armageddon. Seven days and the
government stops."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government stops. The Education Department is
furloughed. There are riots in the streets. It's enough to
make you think about life's meaning, or at least the
government's.
   For example, there's the fact that the dreaded
Gramm-Rudman sequester would cut spending by only $85.4
billion. Not exactly peanuts, but out of a federal budget of
$1.3 trillion, not mass starvation either. It's a cut of
merely 6.5% -- from the previously scheduled levels. In fact,
the cut is less than the rate that spending was already
scheduled to increase. In other words, even after the dreaded
sequester, overall federal spending would increase.
   Armageddon. Beltway style. Out in the real world, Chase
Manhattan just said it plans to lay off 5,000 employees, Pan
Am 2,500.
   Rather than actually cut anything in government, though,
Washington threatens the country with the worst layoffs
possible. Rather than force choices, Congress and Budget
Director Darman somehow manage to agree that air-traffic
controllers are the first to go. Threaten military defeat in
Iraq. Shut down O'Hare Airport before sending home
congressional staff.
   What will expiate our sins? Of course, a budget agreement.
Some $50 billion in "savings" next year -- out of an economy
of $5 trillion. Higher income-tax rates. More for cigarettes,
beer and gas. We don't know about our readers, but the end
we're praying for isn't October 1, but November 6. That's
Election Day.

   Apple Computer Boosts Efforts in Japan
   To Increases Sales and Attract Investors

   TOKYO -- After years of low visibility in Japan, Apple
Computer Inc. is scrambling to boost its presence here --
pumping up personal computer sales, seeking potential
partners and courting investors.
   "We're growing at over a 100% rate" annually in Japan,
said John Sculley, Apple's chief executive officer. "Apple
Japan will be our largest subsidiary outside of the U.S."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company's board of directors is meeting for the first
time at Apple Japan's headquarters this week, and Mr. Sculley
will present to them his blueprint for boosting Japanese
sales to $1 billion annually by the mid-1990s, up from about
$250 million currently. Mr. Sculley also is visiting Japan
for the listing this month of Apple's stock on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
   Apple is among the most prominent of a growing group of
American hardware and software PC companies jumping into the
Japanese market.
   The Japanese PC market is far less developed than either
the U.S. or European markets, but many analysts think sales
in Japan are taking off, presenting a wide opportunity for
U.S. companies such as Apple -- particularly as their home
market slows down. "The market for the Apple Macintosh in
Japan has so far largely been personal users and
enthusiasts," said David Ushijima, who is helping to launch a
Japanese version of Macworld, an Apple computing magazine, in
November. "There's now a shift toward professional buyers and
business people."
   Apple set up its Japanese subsidiary in 1983, but got off
to a slow start, running through four presidents in its early
years, offering only limited Japanese language capabilities
and charging prices considered high even for the expensive
Japanese market.
   Now its strategy is changing. The company lured a Japanese
executive away from Toshiba Corp. to run its Tokyo
operations, and has a lineup of Japanese language products.
While there has traditionally been a lag between introducing
new products in the U.S. and in Japan, this year's new
products will come out in Japan "almost simultaneously" with
the U.S., executives say.
   In addition to increasing sales, Mr. Sculley indicated he
is looking for more Japanese partnerships, possibly for
sharing technology. He said Apple has a "treasure chest" of
technologies to offer possible partners, although he declined
to give details. He added that he was particularly interested
in the Japanese strengths in "miniaturizing" computers into
laptops and notebooks.
   Although Mr. Sculley said Apple doesn't need more capital,
he hopes the listing on the Tokyo exchange will draw more
Japanese investment. In the U.S., he said, "hi-tech stocks
are trading stocks. I prefer to see investors in it for the
long term. One of the things I admire about Japanese industry
is its ability to invest in building."

   TOKYO -- Japan's oil imports in August rose 10.9% from a
year earlier, to 122.7 million barrels, according to a
preliminary report from the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry.
   Imports were up 16.3% from July because of increasing
demand and seasonal refining factors.

<TEXT>
   Mideast sources accounted for 86.7 million barrels, 70.7%
of the total and up 7.8% from a year earlier. Imports from
Southeast Asia grew 17.4%, to 21.2 million barrels.
   The oil from the Mideast was purchased before Iraq's Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait, and thus wasn't affected by Japan's
embargo on purchases of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
   Some of the Southeast Asian oil was purchased after the
embargo, explaining part of that increase.

   Marriott Cuts Back
   Capital Spending,
   Construction Starts

   Marriott Corp. said it will delay construction starts of
most new hotels and senior living centers as well as reduce
next year's capital expenditures because of the weakness in
the real-estate, lodging and financial markets.
   The lodging and food-services company, based in
Washington, D.C., also said asset sales would be lower than
expected earlier this year. In the spring, the company told
analysts it expected to sell about $2 billion of assets.
Yesterday, William J. Shaw, Marriott's chief financial
officer, said the company has sold about $900 million in
assets this year and expects to sell a further $700 million
in the next few months. The company didn't detail which
assets it was looking to sell.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   James Meyer at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia
said the Japanese would probably be the most likely buyers
for some of Marriott's properties as U.S. demand has died
away.
   Capital expenditures will be reduced to about $650 million
next year, compared with $1.3 billion this year, Mr. Shaw
said. Construction projects already under way, such as a new
senior living center in Boca Raton, Fla., will be completed.
   Marriott is also putting a different spin on its business
strategy. Traditionally, the company has developed hotel
properties and then sold them to investors, while retaining
the management contracts. Going forward, Marriott will place
greater emphasis on prefinancing development projects as well
as working with third parties and developing joint ventures,
Mr. Shaw said.
   While most analysts said Marriott's scaled-back
construction and capital-spending plans were a step in the
right direction, few are bullish on the company. Caroline
Levy at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. is worried that some of
the company's assets might be overstated on its balance
sheet.
   Ms. Levy suspended her earnings estimate on Marriott
Monday because she believes the company might have to "take
write-downs against up to $3 billion of its assets." Sizable
write-downs "could feasibly wipe out its net worth," she
said. The company had $461 million in equity at the end of
the second quarter, with $3.4 billion of debt.
   Marriott's announcement yesterday came just one day after
its stock hit an eight-year low at $10.875. The stock has
lost about half its market value in recent months as worries
about the slowdown in the lodging industry and sinking
real-estate markets have increased.
   Yesterday, Marriott shares rose 75 cents to $11.625 in
active New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   Rule of Law:
   Punish Milken for What He Did,
   Not What Prosecutors Say He Did

   Why should the end of the Michael Milken prosecution be
any less bizarre than the initial outrage of RICOing
investment bankers? Judge Kimba Wood is scheduled to sentence
Mr. Milken on Monday, but first prosecutors want hearings on
why she should jail Mr. Milken for crimes he did not admit.
Prosecutors who originally sought a sentence of 520 years
have decided the only "trial" they will risk is a sentencing
hearing without niceties such as a jury or presumption of
innocence.
   If Judge Wood considers the government's arguments on a
sentence based on Mr. Milken's non-pleas, she must first hold
hearings on whether the charges are likely true. Despite
due-process problems, courts sometimes allow Fatico hearings,
named for Carmine Fatico. He pleaded guilty to hijacking
trucks; then a judge held a post-plea hearing on whether he
also was a fully initiated member of the Gambino Mafia crime
family.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judge Pierre Leval refused to hold Fatico hearings before
he sentenced Robert Freeman. Mr. Freeman agreed to a plea
based on his "Your Bunny has a good nose" conversation. Judge
Leval refused to let prosecutors file a sentencing memo
claiming 20 other crimes, noting that "the government had the
opportunity to charge the defendant with those 20 crimes" and
that he would be "simply incapable of resolving these
disputed issues."
   Mr. Milken's prosecutors have a 215-page sentencing memo
that tries to justify the original indictment on 98 counts
including RICO and insider trading. Mr. Milken refused to
admit any racketeering or insider trading. The good news for
Mr. Milken is that the 129-page response from his lawyers
released yesterday starts to clear the air about what he did
and what he did not do:
   -- Mr. Milken's lawyers note that prosecutors still accuse
him of insider trading in several securities including Viacom
and Lorimar. They say this is despite the evidence by the
traders involved, now the government's own witnesses, who say
the trades were legal and that they never discussed them with
Mr. Milken.
   -- Prosecutors could not gather enough evidence linking
Mr. Milken to allegedly illegal activities by
Princeton/Newport. The Milken memo notes that they want Judge
Wood to "assume" that Mr. Milken was somehow involved based
in part on a phone call in 1978, six years before the alleged
offenses.
   -- In their reply memo, Mr. Milken's lawyers accuse
prosecutors of extraordinary overreaching. In addition to the
abusive use of the anti-Mafia RICO law, they make the serious
accusation that "many of the allegations presented by the
government relate to incidents that we believe are not
`crimes' under federal statutes."
   Prosecutors seeking a sentence for crimes Mr. Milken
refused to admit is par for the course in this prosecution.
Rudolph Giuliani twisted RICO to coerce a plea from Drexel
Burnham Lambert and testimony from others. Prosecutors
indicted Mr. Milken's brother Lowell as a hostage. They even
sent an FBI agent to pressure Mr. Milken's 92-year-old
grandfather. The battle over Mr. Milken's non-admissions is
another reason that after all the publicized investigation
prosecutors should have taken this case to trial.
   How much punishment does Mr. Milken deserve? Anything like
the maximum 28 years would be absurd. Unlike Ivan Boesky,
Dennis Levine and Martin Siegel, Mr. Milken was not convicted
of insider trading. Mr. Boesky made more than $80 million by
trading cash -- often literally in suitcases -- for the
inside information bankers Levine and Siegel stole from their
clients. All three knew they were committing serious,
entirely nontechnical crimes.
   So Mr. Boesky's three-year sentence should establish a
high ceiling for Mr. Milken's punishment. Indeed, Judge Wood
might note that despite prosecutors analyzing hundreds of
transactions where Mr. Milken had enormous inside information
on takeovers, they could not prove he traded on any of it.
   Mr. Milken committed crimes, but these were chiefly
accommodations for more serious lawbreaking by others,
including Mr. Boesky. Most of the crimes in years past would
have been dealt with by stern letters from the Securities and
Exchange Commission. There are few, if any, victims. Even the
clearly illegal fudging on the commissions Drexel got from
the Finsbury Fund (legal if disclosed) amounted to several
hundred thousand dollars.
   Judge Wood has hundreds of letters on the sentence Mr.
Milken deserves. These overwhelmingly urge a light sentence.
There are few letters from clients claiming Mr. Milken did
them wrong. Letters from public-school teachers and hospital
administrators cite Mr. Milken's volunteer work and often
anonymous charitable donations, which predated his legal
troubles. Letters from former Drexel colleagues remind the
judge that Mr. Milken criticized recent overly leveraged
takeovers, which he called "Xeroxes" of earlier successful
financings that ignored changed circumstances.
   The most provocative information may be what was redacted
or censored from the sentencing memos. There is a single
reference to a probation report in Mr. Milken's memo. This is
followed by blackouts wherever it seems there might be a
reference to favorable conclusions of a probation officer.
These findings are confidential, but there are reports that
it concludes Mr. Milken's contributions outweigh his crimes.
This first assessment by a neutral observer may help explain
why prosecutors want more hearings.
   Mr. Milken has already suffered from the years of legal
battles. Indeed, consider the $1.1 billion prosecutors said
he earned from 1984 to 1987. Subtract from this the $600
million fine Mr. Milken agreed to pay, the $500 million he
probably paid in state and federal taxes and the $300 million
his aides say he gave to charities. Grand total: minus $300
million, not counting his legal bills.
   What would be an appropriate sentence? Mr. Milken's
lawyers suggest taking up the invitation of Los Angeles
Police Chief Daryl Gates to sentence him to community service
on an anti-drug program.
   Whatever the punishment, Judge Wood's sentencing will at
least be the first legitimate legal action against Mr.
Milken. The contribution to justice from prosecutors in this
case includes RICO, unconstitutionally freezing Mr. Milken's
salary, helping drive Drexel into liquidation and threatening
Mr. Milken with the smear of lawsuits blaming him for the
savings-and-loan crisis. It is time for a judge to try to
craft some justice after a prosecution that knew no bounds.

   WATERTOWN, Mass. -- Like a jeweler displaying his wares,
Gregory Yurek, president of American Superconductor Corp.,
proudly lays out a set of silver objects his concern has
crafted.
   "I get a warm, fuzzy feeling in my stomach when I see the
results on this," he says, holding one that looks like a
fettuccine noodle. It contains a superconductor embedded in
silver. American Superconductor has made similar malleable
strands several feet long that can carry more electricity
than a copper cable as thick as a broomstick.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That's the kind of thing that, three years ago, exuberant
scientists said would be possible with new "high-temperature"
superconductors. But then reality set in: The materials were
brittle, chemically unstable and unable to carry much
electricity when fashioned into wires. Last year, some
observers even declared the superconductor party was over --
at least for applications, such as levitated trains and
cheaper power generation, requiring wires or other "bulk"
forms of the materials. For various reasons, researchers
working on superconducting thin films for electronic
applications didn't face such problems.
   But now, somewhat to researchers' surprise, predictions
they made in the heady days of discovery are beginning to
come true. American Superconductor, for example, recently
delivered a superconducting magnet to the U.S. Navy for
research on a new generation of sonars. The company expects
by 1995 to be selling large quantities of superconducting
wires for prototype magnets, electric motors, generators and
other technologies, Mr. Yurek says.
   "The possibility (of bulk applications) for
high-temperature superconductors didn't look very good 12
months ago," says David Larbalestier, a University of
Wisconsin expert on the materials. "It looks a great deal
better today." Adds John Rowell, vice president and chief
technical officer at Conductus Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif.,
superconductor company: "When you put together incremental
advances, you realize the situation is very different from a
year or two ago."
   Perhaps the main advance during the past year has been the
discovery of a solution to the "weak-link" problem, which has
bedeviled researchers trying to make wires of the new
materials. The wires contain countless tiny crystals, each of
which conducts electricity without resistance when cooled --
the hallmark of superconductivity. But the meeting points of
the crystals, the weak links, acted like loose connections in
an old radio, hindering or cutting off the superconducting
current. That sharply limited the current that wires of the
new materials would carry.
   About a year ago, however, German and Japanese researchers
discovered that at a temperature of around 20 degrees Kelvin,
or minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit, the weak-link problem
largely disappears in new superconductors containing the
element bismuth. That's far below the 77 degrees Kelvin, or
minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit, of liquid nitrogen, the cheap
refrigerant that scientists planned to use with the new
superconductors. But it's not as dauntingly cold as the four
degrees Kelvin above absolute zero needed for older
superconductors.
   For example, reaching four degrees Kelvin requires helium
"liquefiers," machines that "can be somewhat finicky" and
cost $200,000 to $500,000 or more, says Mark Jalbert, a sales
manager at the CTI Cryogenics division of Helix Technology
Corp., Waltham, Mass. By comparison, CTI and other companies
make high-technology refrigerators, called "cryocoolers,"
that can reliably cool things to 20 degrees Kelvin and are
priced at less than $20,000. Another cooling option around 20
degrees Kelvin is liquid neon, which may prove useful in
superconducting electronics, says Conductus's Mr. Rowell.
   Furthermore, "reliability and ease of use" of
superconducting systems are much enhanced at 20 degrees
Kelvin, compared with levels of four degrees Kelvin, notes
Frank Fradin, who manages superconductor research at Argonne
National Laboratory near Chicago. Various properties of
superconductors make them less likely to "go normal," or
suddenly lose superconductivity, at 20 degrees Kelvin, he
adds. That's a crucial factor to engineers developing
superconducting wires, magnets and motors. Such devices can
instantly melt if they go normal, as the huge currents they
are carrying suddenly meet electrical resistance and produce
heat.
   Researchers can't explain the weak-link advance, which may
apply to thallium as well as to bismuth superconductors. But
they've been quick to jump on it. "We're lining up contracts
and building a business" to supply wires for prototype
devices based on bismuth superconductors at 20 degrees
Kelvin, says American Superconductor's Mr. Yurek, a former
Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor.
   The company, a venture-backed concern founded in 1987 by
four MIT professors, has formed partnerships with Inco Ltd.
and Pirelli Cable Corp. to help make such wires. It also has
formed a joint venture with undisclosed partners to make
cryocoolers, which Mr. Yurek says will be integrated with its
bismuth wires for operation at around 20 degrees Kelvin.
   At the heart of the company's strategy is a simple,
old-fashioned metal-working technique that Mr. Yurek calls
"heat and beat." The process involves baking superconductor
precursors and silver in kilns, then forcefully shaping the
compounds into wires and noodle-like tapes with off-the-shelf
machines. After testing countless heat-and-beat variations,
the company now can tailor wires' properties for specific
applications by slightly varying the basic recipe, boasts Mr.
Yurek.
   Despite such successes, researchers haven't given up their
original goal of using superconductors at balmier, and more
easily attained, temperatures. "The real benefits (of the new
materials) come out at liquid-nitrogen temperature," asserts
Peter Loconto, president of Ceramics Process Systems Corp.,
Milford, Mass., whose CPS Superconductor Corp. unit is
developing superconducting wires for use at that temperature.
But he adds that revenues from near-term applications at 20
degrees Kelvin should give superconductor developers critical
funds to support their longer-term quest for blockbusters
that work at liquid-nitrogen temperature.
   To be sure, there are still hurdles to commercializing
superconductors at 20 degrees Kelvin. First, researchers must
fabricate wires tens or hundreds of feet long that can carry
the huge currents they've recently attained in test samples a
few inches or feet in length. Then they must devise ways to
reliably manufacture and insulate many miles of the wire.
   The cost of silver, the coating for superconducting wires,
may pose another stumbling block. Silver helps conduct
electricity, imparts malleability and is one of few
substances that can protect superconductors from chemical
changes that rob them of their magic powers. Thus, it has
become a standard sheathing for new superconductors. Still,
notes Mr. Yurek, it isn't as expensive as some other precious
metals used in high-tech applications, such as the niobium
widely used in older, "low temperature" superconductors.
   Perhaps the darkest cloud now on the U.S. superconductor
horizon is the possibility that the Japanese competition will
dominate the nascent market. Sumitomo Electric Industries
Ltd., for example, recently announced that it plans to offer
bismuth superconductor tapes within two years for prototype
applications. Furukawa Electric Co. and Hitachi Ltd. also are
reportedly moving quickly to commercialize bismuth
superconductors. In a recent report, the Commerce Department
stated that although the U.S. stands about even with Japan in
the race to commercialize superconductors, it will "lose
badly" to Japan if present trends continue.
   "There are 20 companies in Japan developing advanced
superconductors," says American Superconductor's Mr. Yurek,
"and all 20 are focusing on wires" and their applications. A
recent Japanese report, he adds, predicts that such
applications will comprise an estimated 75% of the $8 billion
to $12 billion market for new superconductors in 2000.
Meanwhile, the U.S. push in new superconductors has focused
mainly on electronic applications such as faster computers
and sensors for military uses.

   NEW YORK -- CBS narrowly won the prime-time ratings race
for the first week of the 1990-91 television season, its
first weekly victory since January 1987.
   According to figures compiled by the A.C. Nielsen Co., CBS
Inc.'s network, which has ranked third among the three major
networks for three consecutive years, finished the week with
an average rating of 13.6% of U.S. homes and a 23% share of
the nightly viewing audience. A unit of General Electric Co.,
the NBC network, which has been No. 1 for five years, ran
second in the week with a 13.4 rating and 23 share. Capital
Cities/ABC Inc.'s ABC network was third with a 13.2 rating
and 22 share. And News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Co., with
five nights of programming, had a 5 rating and 8 share. (A
ratings point represents 931,000 or 1% of the nation's TV
households; shares are the percentage of sets in use.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In other ratings news, the first two installments of "The
Civil War," a 12-hour series broadcast on the Public
Broadcasting Service, set a record as the largest audience
ever for a PBS program. On Monday, it registered a 9.1 rating
and 13 share, according to overnight Nielsen ratings from 24
major markets.
   Despite the strong showing by CBS in prime time, the "CBS
Evening News with Dan Rather" slid into third place,
attracting 8.5% of U.S. homes. ABC's newscast was in first
place for the 37th week with 10.3% of homes, and NBC was
second with 8.8%.

   Technology:
   Device to Help
   In Preventing
   Electrical Fires

   Low-Cost Sensor Designed
   To Detect Corrosive Gas
   From Burning Insulation

   Bell Communications Research Inc. is expected to introduce
today a low-cost device that can help prevent electrical
fires in homes, businesses and major computer centers.
   The device detects fires involving polyvinyl chloride, a
common cable insulation material used in the electrical
wiring for nearly all homes and businesses. Polyvinyl
chloride, or PVC, also commonly is used in telephone
switching offices and data centers, covering the connectors
between personal computers and large mainframe computer
systems.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The purpose of the device is to detect a fire very early
on," explains Glen Neuburger, who invented the fire detector
for Bell Communications, also known as Bellcore. With
PVC-related fires, Mr. Neuburger says, "a few minutes can
mean the difference between a minor, localized event and one
that can cause widespread damage to remote equipment."
   In June 1988, a fire involving PVC gutted a two-story
Illinois Bell Telephone Co. building in the Chicago suburb of
Hinsdale, Ill. The fire crippled key elements of the
company's central switching office and fiber-optic network.
It also knocked out service for about 35,000 customers.
   Bellcore's zinc-based device works by "sensing" a PVC fire
in its initial stage, reacting chemically to the presence of
hydrogen chloride gas. The gas, emitted when PVC overheats or
burns, is extremely corrosive and destructive to electronic
equipment. It also can cause severe irritation to workers'
throat and lungs.
   Other sensors detect fires by "seeing" the smoke, using
light scattering technologies, or by "feeling" the heat,
using thermal sensing devices. Accordingly, in fires that
don't involve PVC, the Bellcore device wouldn't trigger an
alarm. The device "isn't meant to replace fire detectors,"
says Mr. Neuburger, "but to work in conjunction with them."
   Bellcore, the research arm for the seven regional Bell
companies, is banned from manufacturing such devices itself.
That restriction is part of the consent decree that broke up
the Bell System in 1984.
   Instead, Bellcore licenses its technology. Several of the
regional Bells have expressed interest in the product.
BellSouth Corp. has been testing the device in its switching
offices in Kentucky.
   The device is expected to cost about the same as
conventional smoke detectors used in office buildings today.
   As its active sensing element, Bellcore's fire detector
uses an inexpensive quartz crystal coated with zinc and
activated by electrical current. The crystal is calibrated to
vibrate at a certain frequency. The sensor is attached to a
palm-sized computer that monitors frequency changes.
   Zinc is one of the prominent metal finishes used in
telecommunications equipment. When hydrogen chloride gas is
present, zinc corrodes and forms zinc chloride, which rapidly
absorbs water from the air. The added water weight and zinc
residue on the crystal combine to alter the frequency and set
off an alarm before smoke and flames erupt.
   Other devices that detect hydrogen chloride gas cost
several thousand dollars each. Among the makers are
Pyrotronics, Fenwal Inc. and Simplex Time Recorder Co. Most
of these products are used mainly in factories where hydrogen
chloride can be released inadvertently.

   Amoco Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Co. said they
tentatively settled long-simmering antitrust suits alleging
they fixed natural-gas prices in the Midwest in the early
1980s.
   A spokesman for Amoco in Chicago said, "Details of the
settlement are being held confidential pending final
documentation and approval by the court." An Occidental
spokesman in Los Angeles also declined to provide details on
the size of the settlement but said it "will have no
materially adverse impact on Occidental's consolidated
financial position."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing,
Amoco indicated that a series of claims arising out of the
same charges totaled about $5.6 billion against all
defendants. However, in the filing, Amoco called the claims
"grossly inflated" and predicted that the case wouldn't have
a material impact on it, either.
   The settlement was reached yesterday just as the trial was
set to begin in federal district court in Kansas City, Kan. A
third defendant, the pipeline company Williams Cos. of Tulsa,
Okla., hasn't settled and trial is scheduled to begin today,
said Neil Woerman, chief of staff for the Kansas attorney
general, a plaintiff in the suit.
   Late yesterday Williams couldn't be reached for comment.
   Mr. Woerman also declined to disclose the size of the
settlements. He said the court has asked that settlement
documents be filed Friday, but isn't certain lawyers will
meet the deadline.
   The suits were filed by attorneys general in Kansas and
Missouri as well as retail utilities in the states. The suits
alleged that units of Amoco, Occidental and Williams used a
1980 change in natural-gas pricing rules to amend contracts
to sell and supply gas to those utilities that doubled the
price.

   The entire point of Sinead O'Connor's protest seems lost
to your Review &amp; Outlook staff. In "No One Sillier Than U,"
Asides, Aug. 28, the Irish singer is trounced for her
refusal, in her words, "to go onstage after the anthem of a
country that's arresting people and harassing people for
expressing themselves onstage." You suppose that Ms. O'Connor
was referring to performance artists and "chocolate-covered
women" bankrolled by the National Endowment for the Arts. In
truth, her unwillingness to perform after the American
national anthem was in protest of the arrest of members of an
allegedly "obscene" rap act after a performance in Florida.
You should be the first to understand and appreciate the
important distinction between taxpayer-subsidized art and
music that is a product of free-market supply and demand.
While we all are forced to pay the tab for NEA-financed art,
there is no such thing as compulsory rap-concert attendance.
   In this case, Ms. O'Connor was correctly standing up for
one of the guiding principles of the Founding Fathers:
namely, freedom of speech. Like the original American
patriots, her gesture was explicitly anti-Big Brother, not
anti-American. The uproar over this whole episode suggests
that far too many Americans are out of touch with their
roots, confusing true patriotism with an uncritical
acceptance of whatever the government does. As the prophetic
Ms. O'Connor observes on her latest album, "these are
dangerous days -- to say what you feel is to make your own
grave." Everyone who believes in personal and economic
freedom should be embarrassed that it takes a 23-year-old
Irish rock singer to remind us of our own heritage.

   Your derision of Ms. O'Connor's refusal to have the
national anthem played before her concert was baffling on
several counts. Least important, but worth noting, playing
the anthem before any rock concert is like playing Led
Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love" to open a corporate board
meeting. It's not a matter of conflicting principles so much
as simple incongruity.
   Your assertion that there have been no "arrests . . . yet
of chocolate-covered women" is amusing, but ignores the
recent arrests of rappers 2 Live Crew and suits filed against
museums exhibiting photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's works.
Let's face it: The energy of vicarious moralizers is growing
today, much to the dismay of those of us who'd like to see a
bit of that energy directed toward issues like the deficit,
the environment or national competitiveness.
   Your editorial's (unintentional?) message is, "Ms.
O'Connor is a damn good publicist." Were she a brand of cola,
your "Marketplace" section would be describing her shrewd
leverage of the media to establish product differentiation.
Between the current incident and her refusal to appear on
"Saturday Night Live" with Andrew Dice Clay, Sinead O'Connor
has demonstrated that she is a first-rate marketer, a woman
of firm integrity or, by happy coincidence, both.

   It's too bad Ms. O'Connor doesn't understand the workings
of our government -- of the people by the people. It's not
the U.S. government objecting, but the people. After her
comments, I wonder how she is able to bank the dollars
printed by the U.S. government.

   Treasury's Malign Neglect of the Dollar

   As the IMF and World Bank convene their annual meetings in
Washington, it is important to recognize that the outlook for
U.S. financial markets largely hinges on the fate of the
dollar. This is why the U.S. Treasury Department's policy of
malign neglect of the dollar is so disturbing. The Treasury
has accepted a silent devaluation of the dollar of nearly 10%
on a trade-weighted basis during the spring and summer
quarters. Over the past 15 months the dollar's value has
dropped 16%. If this ominous trend continues, the world
financial system and its underlying economies are likely to
suffer enormously, with consequences far more lasting than
the Middle East's temporary oil price shock.
   Recent history shows clearly that a sinking dollar raises
inflation fears, drives up interest rates, undermines
economic growth and destabilizes financial markets. Recall
the October 1987 stock market crash following that summer's
breakdown of international currency cooperation. Recall also
the October 1989 mini-crash, following the G-7's decision a
month earlier to engage in dollar-bashing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Foreign investors have grown weary of the enlarged
currency risk associated with the purchase of U.S. financial
instruments, including commercial bank liabilities. That is
one reason that foreign capital inflows have virtually dried
up. Recent Commerce Department data show that on balance net
foreign purchases of securities registered an outflow of
capital at an $18 billion annual rate so far this year,
compared with a $48 billion inflow in 1989.
   Domestic investors, who instinctively pull back on the
news of foreign withdrawal, also regard weakness in the
dollar as a market signal of rising expectations of future
inflation. Such expectations are the bane of financial
assets. And these concerns are not without merit.
   A comparison of internationally traded goods shows that
the year-to-year change in producer prices in the U.S. is
5.1%, while Germany registered 1.5% over the past 12 months
and Japan's rate was 1.1%. Purchasing power parity models
suggest a proper dollar valuation of between 150 to 170 yen
and 1.80 and 2.00 marks. So long as the dollar remains below
these levels, it is reasonable to assume that the U.S. will
continue to inflate more rapidly than its major competitors.
In the event, this reduces the expected future value of U.S.
financial assets and causes the dollar to depreciate against
other currencies.
   Regrettably, the U.S. Treasury seems pleased with the
steady erosion of the dollar's purchasing power. Treasury
Under Secretary David Mulford recently reconfirmed his easy
money philosophy by saying that the decline in the dollar has
been "orderly" and is of no concern to the Treasury. Mr.
Mulford believes that a lower dollar will help reduce the
U.S. trade deficit. Every time this head-in-the-sand policy
is articulated, it puts downward pressure on the
international demand for dollars.
   All this leaves the Federal Reserve as the last bastion to
protect the dollar. What the central bank must now do is to
make public its clear commitment to domestic price stability
by protecting the dollar. In recent testimony before the
Joint Economic Committee, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted
of this, but the point must be made with greater clarity. In
the best of all worlds, this strategy should be pursued with
the cooperation of the other G-7 central banks.
   Operationally, the Fed must also make it clear that it
will use financial and commodity market price indicators to
guide the management of money creation and the federal funds
rate. Mr. Greenspan also hinted at this in his JEC testimony,
when he told Congress that the Fed would be inclined to ease
if the bond market reacted positively to a budget deal. This
implies the use of a market price rule as a standard of
monetary value, but here too the policy would be far more
credible if the point were made with greater clarity.
   Since mid-June, the weekly average market price of gold
has moved from $346 to $400. The first $20 of this upward
move occurred before the rise of oil prices. Since then,
Treasury bond yields have jumped 74 basis points, from 8.42%
to 9.16%, while the yield curve has widened from a spread of
only 12 basis points in mid-June to 126 basis points
recently. While the dollar has steadily weakened, the Dow
Jones average has plummeted from 2924 in the week ending June
15th to its current level of around 2450, a drop of roughly
460 points. At the same time, monetary base growth has
accelerated to an annual rate of 8%-12% in the past three
months.
   Under these circumstances, a clear Fed commitment to a
market price rule strategy warrants a minor tightening to
make money relatively scarce, not an easing. Not a major
tightening move, but an increase of perhaps 25 to 50 basis
points in the federal funds rate to signal a clear commitment
to protect the dollar and reinforce the goal of domestic
price stability.
   Markets would react immediately by selling gold and buying
dollars. With massive dollar short positions reported, a
clear message from the Fed would quickly push the dollar up
toward purchasing power parity. Long-term rates would fall as
investors began to fear inflation less.
   While it may appear counter-intuitive, timely Fed action
would actually stimulate the economy. Here's the logic. The
weakest part of the U.S. economy is housing and real estate.
Nearly 64% of Americans own their own homes, and it is the
value of those homes -- not the value of the stock market (in
which only 20% of Americans have direct ownership) -- that
affects family spending decisions. The slump in real estate
and home prices, whose value has dropped nearly $1 trillion
in the past two years, has therefore badly damaged consumer
confidence, which has plummeted 30% over the past 13 months.
   This, in turn, has caused a major cutback in consumer
spending. Real consumer purchases have declined in seven of
the past 12 months. There are of course many other factors
affecting confidence, such as federal, state and local tax
threats, regulatory policies, concerns over the financial
system, the Middle East situation and so forth. But the real
estate-housing slump hurts consumer confidence most.
   High-tax fiscal policies also play a major role in
determining currency values, though not one in a thousand
market gurus seem to understand this. Rising tax burdens
lower the future path of profits, employment, new business
formation and economic growth. As such, these supply-side
effects reduce the marginal utility of money and the demand
for dollars. By making goods scarce, high tax policies render
the existing stock of money more inflationary.
   The dollar has suffered from market fears that punitive
tax increases will weaken the future rate of return on U.S.
assets. Threats of a security transfer tax, a higher marginal
tax rate on personal income or a stiff surcharge on personal
income taxes all erode economic incentives, efficiency and
productivity. What's more, schemes to eliminate the mortgage
interest deduction and the state and local deduction are
being proposed at exactly the wrong moment. While there is
considerable merit in eliminating inefficient tax subsidies,
these are future tax reform items that should be offset by a
drop in the personal income tax rate.
   If hard money actions were accompanied by a reduction in
the capital gains tax rate, a greater rate-of-return and a
lower investment hurdle rate would boost the value of all
U.S. assets, including real estate, stocks and bonds, and
revive risk-taking, entrepreneurship and sagging animal
spirits throughout the economy. Policymakers should also move
toward a reduction in the Social Security tax rate to raise
after tax take-home pay and work incentives for middle and
lower middle-income families. In addition, officials should
recognize that reduced business spending and profitability is
partly a function of excessive corporate tax rates and
unnecessarily long capital cost recovery periods.
   This is the surest path to budget deficit reduction in the
1990's: a comprehensive program that (i) strictly limits the
real growth of federal spending through an enforceable budget
freeze; (ii) restores economic growth and replenishes revenue
flows with a series of tax rate reductions for capital,
families and businesses (off-set by the elimination of major
tax subsidies); and (iii) substantially lowers interest rates
and federal debt-service costs by announcing and maintaining
a market price rule to insure domestic price stability.

   Dollar Rises Against Most Currencies
   On Fed Comments and Mideast Warnings

   NEW YORK -- The dollar rose against all major currencies
except the yen as dealers focused on reassurances by a Fed
governor about credit policy and new warnings from a Soviet
official about the Persian Gulf powder keg.
   Competitive interest rates attract foreign funds to the
U.S. And the dollar is still the first currency that
investors buy when seeking a haven from global instability,
though its place as a long-term safe harbor has been
tarnished by U.S. economic problems.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against the yen in the New York afternoon,
but gained strength against the mark, when a senior German
finance ministry official said in Washington that he believes
the Japanese currency could appreciate further against its
German counterpart.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.5725 marks, up from 1.5590 marks late Monday in New York.
The U.S. currency dropped to 136.72 yen, however, from 137.35
yen in New York late Monday. Sterling was quoted late in the
day at $1.8680, down from $1.8810 late Monday.
   In Tokyo early Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 136.70
yen, unchanged from the close there Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5735
marks, up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.5553 marks.
   On Tuesday, the dollar had started lower in a belated
reaction to the Saturday meeting in Washington of the Group
of Seven industrialized countries. The finance ministers and
central bankers registered their approval of the recent
depreciation of the dollar with direct reference to the yen.
   The mark, which had closed in New York the previous day at
88.17 yen, was slowly losing ground to the Japanese unit and
stood at 87.75 yen before the comment by the German official
was reported. Within 10 minutes, it shed an entire yen before
rising slightly to finish at 86.94 yen.
   As a conduit for cross, or non-dollar, transactions, the
greenback falls against the purchased currency and rises
against the sold counterpart.
   Of more direct benefit to the dollar was a speech before
the United Nations by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze. He denounced Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and
warned that "war may break out in the Gulf region any day,
any moment."
   The U.N. Security Council scheduled a full meeting for
late yesterday, possibly to discuss expanding its land and
sea embargo of Iraq to include air transport.
   The U.S. reported a sharp increase in the number of Iraqi
troops and tanks in southern Kuwait, as Baghdad set Oct. 15
for a "trial" of President Bush for "crimes against the
people of the world."
   Federal Reserve Board Governor Wayne Angell reaffirmed the
central bank's commitment to price stability in the face of
rising oil prices. "Attempting, through an easing of policy,
to somehow avoid or postpone the implied real adjustments of
the oil shock would only serve to undermine the credibility
of policy and lead to potentially more severe adjustments
over the longer run," he said.
   Echoing comments by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Mr.
Angell emphasized the importance of long-term interest rates
over short-term rates. High long-term rates threaten the
recovery of the U.S.'s weak real estate industry.
   Only a "credible commitment to price stability," meaning
holding Fed-influenced short-term rates high, will "bring
about a moderation in long-term interest rates," Mr. Angell
said in the Washington speech.
   Mr. Angell suggested the Fed would wait for the market's
reaction to a federal budget accord before easing credit.
Bond traders are expected to see a diminished flow of
Treasury issues resulting from a reduced U.S. budget deficit
and to bid them higher, lowering their yield.
   "Should a budget agreement lead to lower market rates, the
Federal Reserve would likely not want to curtail such
declines. In the face of falling interest rates, it wouldn't
be desirable for the Federal Reserve to hold up the short end
of the market," Mr. Angell said.
   Alfonso Alejo, a corporate foreign exchange dealer in New
York with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, called Mr. Angell's speech
a "big comment" that "put a bid under the dollar."
   The prospect of interest rate cuts was further diminished
by disarray in Washington. With budget talks still at an
impasse over President Bush's proposal to cut capital gains
taxes, a bill to delay the Gramm-Rudman spending cuts due
Monday was cleared for a vote on the floor of the House. Mr.
Bush repeated his intention to veto the bill.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $402.40 an ounce, down 60 cents.
Estimated volume was a heavy 6.5 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted
at $401.50 an ounce.

   Belzbergs Did Battle

   Your Aug. 21 page-one article on the Belzberg family
ignored the pivotal role First City Financial Co. played in
bringing public scrutiny to an unprecedented piece of
anti-shareholder legislation -- Pennsylvania's recently
enacted anti-takeover bill. As predicted, this legislation
has proved to have a deleterious effect on the stock of
companies incorporated in Pennsylvania. Further, more than
two-thirds of our major corporations have chosen to opt out
of it.
   Although our law firm no longer represents First City or
the Belzbergs, at their behest we led the lobbying efforts
against the bill. We accepted this representation because of
the clear instructions we were given: We were to take a
principled position consistent with sound public policy
representing the point of view of the major public pension
funds of this country. We were not to make a special deal
that would apply only to their investment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Without their involvement, providing the resources and
employing the professionals, the public pension funds would
not have been able to draw the attention of the national and
international media to this controversial bill. In so doing,
the Belzbergs performed a public service for all shareholders
and the American free-market system.
   Contrary to your reporting, because of the uproar and
resulting lengthy debate surrounding the legislation, by the
time it was signed into law more than six months after it was
introduced in the state Legislature, the provisions had
virtually no impact on the Belzbergs. For example, because of
amendments and the passage of time, the disgorgement
provision, perhaps the most controversial provision in the
bill and the one potentially most threatening to the
Belzbergs, had no practical impact on them and the bill had
no impact on the conduct of the Armstrong World Industries
Inc. proxy contest you wrote about.
   The Armstrong management's "decent job" could be
attributed to its having implemented most of the Belzbergs'
suggestions to achieve the results reported. Their
involvement in Armstrong probably benefited everyone
associated with the company except themselves.
   Most important, what goes wholly without notice is the
Belzbergs' singular service to the nation's investors and the
free-market system by opposing legislation described as the
most dangerous attack by government in America upon
capitalism in this century.

   It is true that Samuel Belzberg, along with a handful of
equally reputable operators, is trying to take water from
southern Colorado and sell it to Denver interests. But it is
misleading to suggest that the opposition to the Belzberg
scheme consists only of "ranchers . . . worried about their
wells going dry" and "a group of self-styled New Age
mystics." In fact, the regional opposition is far broader
than that. It also includes self-styled Republicans and
Baptists and agnostics, self-styled shop owners and retired
military officers, self-styled carpenters and waitresses and
schoolteachers -- even some self-styled Wall Street Journal
readers.

   Revised Figures Put Rate
   Of Growth at Just 0.4%

   WASHINGTON -- The economy slowed to a near standstill in
the second quarter, growing at a frail annual rate of 0.4%,
revised government figures show.
   The performance, far weaker than the 1.2% pace the
government estimated in two earlier reports, is of particular
concern because the economy has since been socked by soaring
oil prices in the aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug.

<TEXT>
   Yesterday's report, made by the Commerce Department after
reviewing new data, means that even before the jump in oil
prices piled new burdens on businesses and consumers, the
nation's real gross national product -- the
inflation-adjusted value of all the goods and services the
economy produced -- was barely rising. The earlier estimates
indicated a sluggish pace but clearly one of expansion.
   The White House expressed concern over the new figures but
continued to insist that the economy isn't in a recession.
   "It's not good news. The number is very low," spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said. "Obviously we are concerned about the
economy and the growth rate." Nevertheless, he added: "We
don't believe we are in a recession right now."
   Addressing a luncheon of the National Association of
Business Economists, Michael Boskin, chairman of the White
House Council of Economic Advisers, avoided mention of a
downturn.
   "Certainly we believe the economy now is on a weaker
growth path than we did in the summer, partly -- not
exclusively -- due to" the oil-price shock.
   But Mr. Boskin said the economy is better equipped to
weather the oil jolt than it was in the 1970s when soaring
oil prices pitched the U.S. economy into recessions in 1973
and 1979. Because of new efficiencies in U.S. industrial
production, "for each dollar of GNP we now use about
one-third less oil than we did in the 1970s," he said.
   An increasing number of private analysts, however, think
the feeble economy will be hurt enough by rising oil prices
to slip into a downturn after nearly eight years of
expansion.
   In a survey released yesterday, the business economists
association said more than half of 71 members polled believe
the economy is in a recession already or will be by the end
of the 1991 first quarter.
   And half of the top economists surveyed each month by Blue
Chip Economic Indicators now believe the economy will enter a
recession this year.
   Other private analysts maintain that the economy will
muddle through. "The economy is limping along at about the
second-quarter growth rate," said Robert Giordano, director
of economic research for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in New York.
"The oil-price hike can potentially reinforce this weakness
and the fourth-quarter GNP will likely contract or go down,
but the size of this oil-price shock and consequences to date
don't seem severe enough to create a full-blown recession or
downward spiral in the economy."
   A recession is often defined as two consecutive quarters
of contraction in the GNP. For the past five quarters, the
economy has been growing at annual rates of less than 2%. It
barely inched ahead at a 0.3% annual rate in the fourth
quarter of 1989 before picking up to a 1.7% rate of expansion
in the first quarter of this year.
   The Federal Reserve to a large extent engineered the
slowdown in the economy by maintaining high interest rates in
an effort to battle inflation. But the central bank's growth
target was never as low as the recent pace. And now Fed
policy makers are under pressure from the Bush administration
to jump-start the economy by lowering interest rates to make
credit cheaper.
   But although the rising oil prices threaten the economy
with recession they also bring the prospect of resurgent
inflation, and consequently central bank officials are wary
of easing their grip on credit.
   In the second quarter the price of crude oil was running
under $20 a barrel. Yesterday it was trading at $37.53.
   The revisions to the second-quarter GNP reflected a larger
trade deficit and smaller inventories than the government
previously estimated. Personal consumption, which accounts
for about two-thirds of the country's economic activity, was
slightly smaller than earlier estimates.
   After-tax corporate profits declined 0.6% during the
quarter instead of 0.2% as previously estimated, the
department said, to an annual rate of $166.1 billion.
   All the numbers were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.

   ICN BIOMEDICALS Inc. declared a special one-time dividend
of 3.5 cents a share. The special dividend is in addition to
the quarterly dividend of 3.5 cents a share. Both are payable
Nov. 1 to stock of record Oct. 16. ICN Biomedicals, a
supplier to the biotechnology research and clinical
diagnostic marketplaces said it declared the special dividend
"to recognize the continued growth and strong performance of
the company." The Costa Mesa, Calif., company has 11.3
million common shares outstanding. For the first half, the
company had net income of $4.7 million, or 42 cents a share,
on sales of $68.3 million, compared with net income of $2.5
million, or 23 cents a share, on sales of $27.1 million a
year earlier.

   Your Aug. 23 editorial "Squirreling Away Science" on the
Mount Graham red squirrel-University of Arizona telescope
controversy distorted the scientific record and trivialized
the issue. By choosing to make light of "squirrels, owls and
cuckoos," you have undermined your own journalistic
integrity.
   You would have us believe that the initial biological
opinion -- indicating that construction of the telescopes
would not harm the squirrels -- was a valid judgment that was
"stalled" by environmental groups. In fact, the biologists
who rendered the original opinion admitted in court
depositions and in testimony before Congress that they had
been pressured into reaching their conclusions. When U.S.
Fish and Wildlife (FWS) biologists reported new information
in their biological update, they were evaluating a flawed,
outdated opinion. The need for further study is not some
environmental conspiracy; it is the professional opinion of a
blue-ribbon panel of federal biologists.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Contrary to your editorial, the new FWS report did not
conclude that "the original biological opinion wasn't wrong."
The report found new evidence that building the telescopes
could harm both the squirrels and their habitat, including a
decline in population density and greater population
fluctuations. It enumerated other factors not considered
earlier, such as tree disease, pest infestations of trees,
fire history and predation. Evidently you either overlooked
these facts or preferred instead to write about squirrels not
returning phone calls.
   It is a mistake to trivialize the discussion of
environmental issues or to weigh in with merely superficial
coverage. A majority of Americans do not consider the
extinction of species and the loss of precious habitats in
this country to be a joke. We would all be better served if
more journalists spent at least as much time researching
their subjects as they do joking about them.

   You fall prey to a popular misconception of science and
scientists. This misconception stems from confusing science,
defined as the systematic study of physical phenomena based
on observation and experiment, with the equipment employed in
a few areas of scientific research. The result is an
erroneous assumption that the validity of scientific research
is directly proportional to the size and cost of the
equipment involved. You seem to imply that "serious
scientific minds" belong only to esoteric individuals
(uniformly attired in horn-rimmed glasses and white lab
coats) who spend their time tinkering with
multimillion-dollar instruments in their sterile "scientific"
laboratories. In fact, "serious scientific minds" are those
most likely to be fascinated equally by biological traits
characterizing obscure subspecies of "squirrels, owls and
cuckoos" as in astronomical observations measuring the
pulsation of cepheid (variables).

   A Mascot's Gender

   First Female `Mountaineer'
   At University Outrages
   Some Students, Alumni

   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- Natalie Tennant raises her
muzzle-loading rifle into the air, races onto the West
Virginia University football field and pulls the trigger. The
blast jolts her, but the real kick comes next: Booing
cascades from the student cheering section in the upper deck,
and front-row fans taunt, "Go back to the kitchen] No
Mountaineer can have PMS]"
   Ms. Tennant, a 22-year-old senior, is the university's
Mountaineer mascot this year -- the first woman ever. Some
people want her to become the first to be targeted in a
recall election.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   West Virginians have revered the buckskin-clad Mountaineer
mascot of the university as the embodiment of the state's
macho frontier past. Many students and alumni are mortified
that the pride of West Virginia now uses eyeliner instead of
after-shave.
   Angry football fans have thrown paper cups and ice at Ms.
Tennant during games. Others have circulated petitions
demanding her ouster and passed out bumper stickers and
buttons that read: "We Don't Want a Mountain-dear. Give us
back our Mountaineer."
   Other places don't seem to have this problem. Harvard
hasn't even figured out what a Crimson looks like, much less
what its gender is. Nobody cares whether there's a woman
under the Princeton Tiger-skin. Notre Dame's Leprechaun has
always been male, although who would know the difference if
it wasn't?
   The difference could become an issue elsewhere, of course
-- just as it has here. Sitting in the stadium's lower deck
during the Maryland game, Jim Bartley, a Morgantown
advertising man, boos as Ms. Tennant passes by. "Should the
Florida State Seminole be a squaw?" he asks. "Should the USC
Trojan be a maid? Should the Texas Longhorn be a milk cow?
For 60 years," he adds, "we've had nothing but total support
for the Mountaineer, and now she's divided the state."
   Huffs Derek Farley, who graduated from the university two
years ago, "If finding sanctuary in a 100-year tradition is
sexist, then you can tattoo it on my chest."
   Ms. Tennant has her supporters. Stores here are selling
sweatshirts emblazoned with a striking dark-haired woman
dressed like Daniel Boone. The campus newspaper has rallied
behind Ms. Tennant with glowing editorials. Many alumni,
particularly women, call out encouragement when they see her.
"Keep it up, Natalie]" yells a woman at a pre-game tailgate
party. "I've got four daughters, and you're a pace-setter]"
   University officials have expressed dismay over Ms.
Tennant's treatment. "I thought we were more sophisticated
than this," says Gordon Thorn, the school's assistant vice
president for student affairs. "It's discouraging, and it
says we have a long way to go before we can handle this kind
of question."
   Ms. Tennant, a journalism major who was raised on a West
Virginia farm, shows a steely indifference toward her
opponents. The abuse is directed toward the idea of a female
Mountaineer, she says, not toward herself as a person. "It
keeps me humble and gives me more drive," she says of the
opposition.
   During the game, she scurries through the stands of the
60,000-seat stadium, slaps hands with fans and has her
picture taken with children. A small blond-haired boy runs up
to her, hands her a quarter and says, "Call me."
   The mascot mess began in the spring, after a student club
selected Ms. Tennant and a male aspirant as finalists in a
competition to become mascot. At a basketball game "cheer
off," thousands of students baited Ms. Tennant, raucously
informing her that she wasn't anatomically fit to be
Mountaineer. To almost everyone's surprise, the club selected
her anyway.
   The next day, the campus statue of the rifle-holding,
knife-toting Mountaineer was wearing women's underwear.
School officials later sprayed the statue with lubricant to
keep it from being painted.
   Some students and alumni want the entire, 22,000-person
student body to elect a new mascot. They say West Virginia's
mountaineer iconography is ample proof that the mascot was
never meant to wear skirts and pantyhose. Whether on the
state seal or a corporate logo, they say, the moutaineer is
almost always depicted as a virile white male.
   The university mascot not only attends athletic events and
parades but also gives speeches at high schools, 4-H Club
meetings, Bible-study classes and pig roasts.
   Many students say that about three-quarters of the student
body, including many women, don't think Ms. Tennant should be
the mascot. Some attribute this to tradition; others, sexism.
There's concern that male students will try to take her gun
at the football games.
   "Some men just hate women," says Dawn Miller, managing
editor of the Daily Athenaeum, the campus newspaper.
   Says Ms. Tennant: "I'm the first female mascot at West
Virginia University, but there were female mountaineers long
before me, like our grandmothers."
   When humans dress up as tigers, panthers or even, as at
Syracuse University, oranges, they rarely display obvious sex
characteristics. But there's never been any doubt about the
gender of the Mountaineer, who dresses in tight-fitting
buckskin with coonskin cap and moccasins. Ms. Tennant's
critics fault her for not having a beard, for being too short
(5 feet, 3 1/2 inches), and for not yelling loud enough.
Because of her size, she can't carry the state flag at games;
it would scrape the ground.
   After the Maryland game, an exhausted Ms. Tennant's
lace-trimmed suit is streaked with sweat. Her cheeks are
sunburned, her hands are smeared with gunpowder and her
pinkie finger sports a bruise from shooting the rifle.
   "You shot the gun too late]" yells a student from the
stands, sunglasses draped around his neck. He also complains
that she didn't wave the state flag and didn't come up to the
student section. He recommends that Ms. Tennant study last
year's mascot from game films.
   Yet her enthusiasm for the mascot-ship has won over some
of West Virginia's crustiest males. This past summer,
attending a pig roast in coal-mining Boone County, she was
told to avoid a 70-year-old resident called "Ol' Buster."
Instead, she marched right up to him, extended her hand and
said, "I hear you're my biggest fan."
   "The hell I am]" Buster snorted, refusing to shake it.
   But Ms. Tennant persisted. She had her rifle; and Buster
also carried a muzzle-loader. Bonded by gunpowder, the two of
them went to an abandoned field to blast away. "Buster" --
Mosie Atkins -- was won over. Today he offers her his
ultimate compliment for her tomboyish toughness. "Hell, she's
worse than a damn boy]" he says in admiration.

   Keating's Petition
   For Review of Bail

   LOS ANGELES -- A California appeals court declined to
review Charles H. Keating Jr.'s $5 million bail, leaving the
indicted former American Continental Corp. chairman to begin
a second week in jail.
   Chicago attorney Stephen C. Neal, who maintains the
66-year-old Mr. Keating is deeply in debt and unable to raise
such an amount, could appeal next to the state supreme court,
although he declined to comment yesterday on what his next
legal step.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Keating and three other officers of either Phoenix,
Ariz.-based American Continental or its Lincoln Savings unit
in California were charged by a state grand jury with
defrauding California purchasers of about $250 million of
uninsured American Continental bonds by making false claims
about the safety of the securities. They surrendered early
last week and are scheduled for a formal arraignment on Oct.
5.
   The co-defendents returned home last weekend after
successfully petitioning for reductions from the $1 million
bail originally set for them. At the same time, however, the
state Judge Gary Klausner refused to reconsider Mr. Keating's
$5 million bail, and said he believed the Arizona businessman
might have reasons to flee from the criminal prosecution, and
other legal and financial problems.
   Mr. Neal criticized as "wholely inappropriate and inept"
remarks on Friday by Los Angeles County District Attorney Ira
Reiner, who said Mr. Keating's mug shot "ought to be posted
in every boardroom in the United States," and compared the
Keating case to that of fugitive financier Robert Vesco.
   Mr. Keating's attorneys maintained in their petition to
the appeals court that Mr. Keating is "unlawfully imprisoned"
because he doesn't present a flight risk and has bail "50
times higher than bail set for other defendants faced with
identical charges." Mr. Neal had told Judge Klausner that Mr.
Keating is interested only in defending himself against the
charges, but that he "can't prepare a defense from L.A.
County Jail. It is impossible."

   Loss of $36 Million

   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- Oracle Systems Corp. reported its
first quarterly loss, with results significantly lower than
it had forecast nearly three weeks ago.
   The big data-base software company said it had a net loss
of $36 million, or 27 cents a share, for the first quarter
ended Aug. 31, compared with net income of $11.7 million, or
nine cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 16%
to $203.7 million, from $175.5 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On Sept. 7, Oracle had warned that it would report a loss,
mainly because revenue didn't meet a 50% growth target. In
the announcement, however, the company estimated revenue
growth in the first quarter at 30%, much higher than the 16%
reported yesterday. Moreover, Oracle had previously warned of
a loss of 20 cents a share, considerably narrower than the
actual 27 cents a share.
   Michael Fields, the new president of Oracle's USA
division, said the change in results occurred because of "a
major deterioration in the projected numbers from the USA
finance" department. He said the department's projections
included sales contracts that couldn't be recognized in the
quarter, and excluded compensation for sales representatives
who were no longer with the company.
   The earnings report was yet another of a series of recent
surprises for the company. In March, its stock sank 31% after
reporting flat third-quarter earnings. It also reported some
accounting problems and a week ago fired 400 workers to cut
costs.
   "While we are disappointed with our first quarter results,
we expect to return to profitability in our second quarter,"
said Lawrence Ellison, Oracle's president and co-founder.
   Oracle's earnings were reported after the close of
trading. Its stock finished at $7.375 a share in
over-the-counter trading yesterday, up 12.5 cents. Since
March, Oracle's shares have dropped about 74%.

   By Preventing Absorption

   Smokers trying to quit shouldn't try to chew nicotine gum
and drink coffee or soda at the same time.
   Addiction researchers said a laboratory experiment with
eight longtime smokers showed that coffee and cola-type soft
drinks will prevent the absorption of nicotine from the
nicotine chewing gum, thus defeating the use of the gum as an
aid to breaking the cigarette habit. The gum is sold in the
U.S. under the brand name Nicorette by Marion-Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc., a subsidiary of Dow Chemical Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The researchers said many smokers may fail to quit smoking
because they inadvertently render the nicotine gum
ineffective by consuming slightly acidic food and drinks at
the same time they chew the gum. The drinks increase the
acidity of the saliva and change the gum's nicotine into a
non-absorbable form, researchers said. They suggested that
other foods and drinks, including beer, tomato juice and
various fruit juices, are also acidic enough to defeat the
purpose of the gum.
   It is difficult enough for smokers to get an effective
dose of nicotine from the chewing gum even under the best of
conditions, a research team from the federal National
Institute of Drug Abuse and the University of Kentucky said
in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The Nicorette gum sold in the U.S. contains two milligrams
of nicotine per stick, or cube, of gum. But even if the
patient chews the gum precisely according to instructions, he
or she will absorb only 0.8 to 0.9 milligrams of nicotine per
stick, which is slightly less than that which is absorbed
from a cigarette with a moderate amount of nicotine.
   Interviews with nicotine gum users found that many of
those who failed to get an adequate dose of nicotine from the
gum drank coffee, fruit juices or soft drinks as they chewed
gum, Jack E. Henningfield of the NIDA's Addiction Research
Center in Baltimore and his colleagues said.
   To see if these acidic beverages were affecting absorption
of nicotine, they enlisted eight adult smokers who agreed to
sit in the lab for three hours, submitting to blood tests,
chewing nicotine gum and rinsing their mouths with coffee, a
cola or distilled water at precise intervals. The nicotine
gum used was a version sold in the U.K. and Canada by the
Swedish drug maker, Pharmacia AB; this version contains four
milligrams of nicotine, twice the dosage of the U.S. brand of
Nicorette.
   Whenever the volunteers rinsed with distilled water, or
did a simulated rinse with their own saliva while chewing the
high-strength gum, nicotine levels in their blood rose
sharply within five minutes and stayed up for at least 15
minutes. But whenever they rinsed with coffee or the cola,
there was only an insignificant rise in blood nicotine
levels.

   United Services
   Says It Isn't Linked
   To Inquiry Target

   United Services Advisors Inc., which manages $650 million
in mutual fund assets, is again trying to distance itself
from a possible business embarrassment.
   Last year, the San Antonio, Texas, concern changed hands
after its founder, Clark Aylsworth, was forced by the
Securities and Exchange Commission to give up control. The
SEC action followed a discovery in the mid-1980s that one of
the fund group's portfolio managers was conspiring with two
Vancouver stock promoters to stack the mutual fund he ran
with worthless Canadian mining stocks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, United Services, which specializes in gold and
natural resource stocks, is eager to deny any connection with
Mr. Aylsworth's son, C. Allyn Aylsworth.
   The firm sent a letter last week to 500 United Services
fund shareholders who had invested through the younger Mr.
Aylsworth's coin and gold bullion business, Auric United
Corp. The letter advised the shareholders that Auric was
being investigated by the Texas attorney general's office and
said that there isn't any connection between Auric and United
Services.
   Yesterday, a district court in Bexar County, Texas,
granted a temporary restraining order stopping Auric from
doing business or disposing of any assets, according to the
Texas attorney general's office, which requested the court
order. In addition, the attorney general's office filed a
suit alleging that Auric had violated the state's Deceptive
Trade Practices Act.
   According to the state's assistant attorney general, Raul
Noriega, there is a gap between the value of the coins and
bullion held by Auric and the amount it should be holding on
behalf of customers. C. Allyn Aylsworth's lawyer declined to
comment on the case; a recorded telephone message at Auric
said its office was closed yesterday.
   Paul Robertson, general counsel for United Services, said
the firm owned 24.3% of Auric until June 1987, when it sold
its stake to Allyn Aylsworth. In that same month, Mr.
Aylsworth, who was then a vice president for marketing at the
fund group, left United Services, Mr. Robertson said.
   Mr. Aylsworth's father, Clark Aylsworth, agreed to sell
his controlling stake in the firm late last year to settle
SEC charges of failing to properly supervise a fund manager.
The charges, which he didn't admit or deny, grew out of the
manager's purchase of the worthless mining stocks.
   The elder Mr. Aylsworth had continued to work as a
consultant with United Services, but yesterday the firm said
the arrangement had been terminated. Mr. Aylsworth couldn't
be reached for comment.
   United Services' largest fund is a gold fund, the $250
million U.S. Gold Shares fund.

   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks rebounded from
Monday's lows as investors hunted for bargains among some
larger OTC stocks.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.62 to 354.78, 0.7% gain,
as volume eased to 109.9 million shares from 114.8 million
Monday. Declining shares narrowly outpaced advancers, 967 to
948, as 2,329 issues remained unchanged. The number of stocks
falling to new lows continued to swamp those posting new
highs, 317 to 9.

   "This is a reflex, corrective rally," said Jerry Newman,
institutional trader at Cowen &amp; Co.'s OTC department in San
Francisco. Institutions strode in to buy more shares of
better-quality companies they already own, including some
technology shares, said Patrick O'Malley, vice president of
OTC trading at Needham &amp; Co., New York. Among those, Borland
rose 1 5/8 to 18 and Synoptics Communications jumped 2 to 26
1/2.
   "No news is good news," said Robert McCready,
institutional trader at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, St. Louis. While
small investors didn't rush in to buy shares, they also
weren't readily selling shares in the absence of any
developments on the economic and geopolitical front, Mr.
McCready said. However, he agreed with other traders that the
rally probably will be short-lived.
   Oracle Systems rose 1/8 to 7 3/8 as officials with the
Redwood City, Calif., software maker met with analysts and
investors. After the market closed, Oracle reported a loss
for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 of 27 cents a share,
compared with year-earlier net income of nine cents a share.
Oracle cautioned investors on Sept. 7 that it expected a loss
of 20 cents a share.
   Investors flocked to OTC market's largest stock, MCI
Communications. Shares of the Washington, D.C., long-distance
carrier rose 1 1/4 to 31 and were the day's most active. MCI
unveiled a family of products that the company said will
enable users to "bring the power of supercomputers to the
desktop." Separately, MCI said it will interconnect its
electronic mail service with three Scandinavian electronic
mail services. The Nasdaq Utility Index, which includes MCI,
rebounded 5.78 to 468.13.
   Buy-out news boosted the stocks of several companies.
   Justin Industries sprinted 1 1/4 to 15 after a group of
dissident shareholders launched an $18-a-share tender offer
for 6.2 million shares of the Fort Worth, Texas, maker of
boots and building components. Justin has twice rejected
buy-out offers from the group, led by Perry H. Sutherland of
Kansas City, Mo., and Barry S. Rosenstein of New York.
   Separately, Justin said a federal judge refused to delay
the closing of the company's $9-a-share offer for Tony Lama
and denied a motion by the dissident group calling for a
special shareholders' meeting.
   TVX Broadcast Group leaped 1 3/8 to 9 after the Virginia
Beach, Va., concern accepted a sweetened $9.50-a-share bid
from Paramount Communications to buy the 17% of TVX that
Paramount doesn't already own. In July, a TVX special
committee rejected a $7.50-a-share bid from Paramount.
   Henley Group jumped 1 3/8 to 20 7/8. A group including
Libra Investment &amp; Trade Ltd. said late Monday that it
increased its stake in the La Jolla, Calif.-based laboratory
and medical-equipment maker to 22.9% of the common shares.
   Intel gained 1 3/4. Intel and Alliant Computer Systems
have joined four multinational computer companies in agreeing
to set standards for certain Intel software, which can be
used as alternative to Sun Microsystems' RISC-based
workstation architecture. Alliant was unchanged at 2 3/8 and
Sun was unchanged at 27 1/4.
   Other technology shares were mixed.
   Microsoft gained 1 7/8 to 60 3/8 and Conner Peripherals
edged up 1/8 to 19 1/2, but Apple Computer eased 1/4 to 30.
   Companies continued to take advantage of low stock prices
to announce plans to buy back their stock. Maynard Oil rose
1/2 to 8 1/4 and Oshkosh Truck Class B shares advanced 3/8 to
8 1/4. Both companies said they plan to repurchase shares.
   Among the day's losers, FileNet plunged 3 7/8 to 5 1/8.
The Costa Mesa, Calif., management systems concern said
revenue for the third quarter will fall below analysts
expectations. FileNet also said it may report a "modest loss"
for the quarter.
   Old Stone slipped 1/4 to 7 1/4 after the Providence, R.I.,
commercial bank cut its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a
share from 39 cents. Old Stone also said it expects to report
a "small loss" for the third quarter ending Sept. 30. A year
earlier, Old Stone reported a loss of $6.17 a share,
including provisions for loan losses and real estate-related
investments.
   Ilio tumbled 2 1/8 to 3 7/8. A spokeswoman for the
Secaucus, N.J., clothing retailer and distributor said the
company has no pending news to account for the plunge.
Concern about the financial status of Ilio's underwriter,
R.H. Damon &amp; Co., apparently pressured the stock, according
to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. However, an
official with R.H. Damon said the underwriter is financially
sound and suggested that some investors may have sold Ilio
shares to meet margin calls.
   Bizmart fell 5/8 to 7 1/2 and traded at a 52-week low of 6
3/4 before recovering. Analysts again lowered earnings
estimates for the Arlington, Texas, operator of office
products superstores, DJPIR reported. Bizmart went public at
$10 a share in August 1989 in an initial public offering led
by Alex. Brown &amp; Sons and Robertson Stephens. Traders
attributed yesterday's selling to reduced earnings estimates
released by Alex. Brown.
   Monty R. Standifer, Bizmart vice president of finance,
told DJPIR the company isn't discouraging analysts from
lowering their earnings for the company's 1991 fiscal year
ending in April to a range of 30 cents to 35 cents a share,
compared with a loss of 15 cents a share in fiscal 1990. Mr.
Standifer said that September sales have slowed "a bit" and
that competition in Dallas and Houston has pressured
Bizmart's prices.
   Separately, Alex. Brown has made some changes in the
consumer areas of its corporate finance and research
departments. Monday, Mark Goodman and Peter Breck were named
co-heads of the consumer group of the firm's corporate
finance division. Senior retail analyst Fred E. Wintzer also
recently retired, according to an official with firm.
   Alex. Brown's reputation was tarnished this summer when
two consumer companies -- Bizmart and In-Store Advertising --
released poor earnings outlooks shortly after they had issued
shares in offerings underwritten by the Baltimore investment
banking firm.

   FDIC Aide Favors
   Cutting Insurance
   On Pension Funds

   WASHINGTON -- William Seidman, chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., said that he favors scaling back the
FDIC's insurance coverage for billions of dollars of pension
funds held in banks.
   Congress and the Bush administration are looking for ways
to reduce taxpayer risk in deposit insurance, following the
massive S&amp;L bailout law passed last year. Such a proposal
also would inevitably restructure the banking industry. The
changes are likely to break down the decades-long separation
between commercial banking and investment and to allow new
freedom for banks to open branches across state lines. Mr.
Seidman, however, didn't offer a specific legislative
package.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time that a consensus is forming to limit
federal insurance coverage for wealthy depositors,
multibillion dollar pension funds continue to benefit from
full deposit insurance coverage. Under current FDIC policy,
each beneficiary of the pension fund is protected up to the
$100,000 maximum coverage.
   "The FDIC might be moving toward becoming the insurer for
the nation's pension programs," Mr. Seidman told the House
Banking Committee yesterday, calling the trend "not
attractive."
   Most of the pension funds held in banks are in instruments
called investment contracts, which have grown from a few
hundred million dollars in 1987 to nearly $10 billion
currently, said a spokesman for Morley Capital Management
Inc. of Lake Oswego, Ore., which places the investment
contracts in banks. "Whether or not this could lead to an
exodus {of the funds} from the banks, I can't say," he said.
   The Bush administration is expected to unveil its own
study on deposit insurance before year end and is likely to
include similar pension fund limitations, an administration
official said. "Our notion is to try to return deposit
insurance to its historical purpose, to protect small
savers," he said.
   Before the October recess, it's likely that Congress will
pass a law permitting the FDIC to raise bank insurance
premiums above current caps in order to bolster the FDIC bank
fund, which is at a record low. The Senate Banking Committee
will hear testimony today on the Senate legislation to raise
the insurance caps. The House already has passed its version.
   Mr. Seidman said, however, that regulators haven't yet
decided whether to raise premiums, and he warned against
using the FDIC fund as a tool to help balance the federal
budget. One recent budget proposal by Democrats hinged on $12
billion in higher bank insurance premiums as an offset for
other spending. "I wouldn't count on us as part of the budget
process to increase {the premiums} to that rate," he said.
   Aside from raising premiums, consensus is forming around
other limitations on deposit insurance. House Banking
Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) lauded a bill
introduced yesterday by Sen. Donald Riegle, (D., Mich.),
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Both chairmen want
to abandon the "too-big-to-fail" policy, in which all
depositors in large banks are protected during a failure --
even those with deposits of more than $100,000. Mr. Seidman
said the idea had "certain appeal" in reducing risk to
taxpayers but could cause instability in banking markets.
   He also joined Messrs. Gonzalez and Riegle in leaning
toward preserving the current $100,000 limit on deposit
insurance, rather than scaling it back to a lower amount as
some in the industry have urged. Such a move would hurt small
banks disproportionately, he said, and limit their ability to
attract funds.
   Mr. Seidman also said that banks should be restructured
sooner rather than later, urging stronger supervision, higher
capital requirements, and reduced bank investment risk. He
has proposed that banks be permitted to engage in riskier
activities only in separately financed subsidiaries. "We have
to decide what we are going to do and move ahead on it," he
said.
   Separately, the Resolution Trust Corp., the S&amp;L cleanup
agency, said the 247 thrifts it controls posted net losses of
$2.6 billion in the second quarter, compared with $2.2
billion in the first quarter.

   Elders IXL Posts $1.08 Billion Loss
   For Year; Write-Downs Are Cited

   SYDNEY, Australia -- Huge write-downs on investments
plunged Elders IXL Ltd. into the red by 1.3 billion
Australian dollars (US$1.08 billion), setting a record for
the largest corporate annual loss in Australian history.
   In the past two years of corporate mayhem in Australia,
former highflying businessmen have been outdoing each other
to post larger losses. Now, John Elliott, who built Elders
from a jam maker into a world-class brewer, joins a list of
titleholders that has included Alan Bond and Bruce Judge,
architect of investment company Ariadne Australia Ltd.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Elders's operating profit after tax fell 80.3% to A$131.9
million in the fiscal year ended June 30 from A$668.6 million
a year earlier. After accounting for extraordinary losses of
A$1.44 billion from write-offs, though, the brewing, finance
and agribusiness company posted an overall loss of A$1.3
billion.
   The company's directors were expected to opt for big
write-downs in the latest annual results as part of a
corporate overhaul to strip the company down to solely a
brewing concern. But the size of the writedowns exceeded many
analysts' predictions. The losses prompted directors to omit
the final dividend, triggering a sharp reduction in the
annual dividend payout -- in line with some predictions.
   It was "a little worse than expected," said Craig
Drummond, who tracks Elders for brokerage firm J.B. Were &amp;
Son. Paying no final dividend, he added, "will come as a
surprise" to many investors.
   And while Elders's directors forecast a return to
profitability soon, some Elders watchers warn that the
current year's profit might not be all that buoyant. In
addition, directors indicated they have further deferred
plans, originally announced last March, to make a capital
return to shareholders of about A$2.2 billion that was to be
raised from the sale of Elders's assets.
   It's all bad news for Elders's debt-strapped controlling
shareholder, Harlin Holdings Pty., a closely held concern
associated with Mr. Elliott, who is also Elders's chairman.
Harlin currently controls 55% of Elders. It depends on the
dividend income to service the hefty debts it incurred in
building its Elders stake and needs the capital return from
Elders to reduce its borrowings.
   In an effort to relieve its financial bind, Harlin this
month arranged to sell 19.9% of its Elders holding to Asahi
Breweries Ltd. of Japan for A$960 million.
   Asahi directors aren't expected to meet to approve the
transaction until sometime in October. But in Tokyo, Koichiro
Iwaki, a senior managing director of Asahi Breweries, said
the Elders loss was expected and won't affect the Japanese
brewer's plans to invest in the world's fourth-largest
brewing group. Indeed, Mr. Iwaki said that Tuesday's
announced loss "is slightly less than we had expected." But
he left open the possibility that other factors could arise
to complicate the decision. He didn't elaborate.
   In the latest year, Elders said, revenue fell 10.3% to
A$15.39 billion from A$17.16 billion, reflecting reduced
contributions from businesses being sold. By the end of the
financial year, Elders had sold A$1.6 billion of nonbrewing
assets and shrunk the gross assets of its finance division to
A$2.7 billion from A$5.9 billion.
   Elders shares closed unchanged Tuesday on the Australian
Stock Exchange at A$1.47 each, ahead of the company's
announcement.
   Before accounting for the extraordinary losses, per-share
earnings dropped to 5.2 Australian cents from 31.3 cents a
year earlier. The company paid a dividend of 8.5 cents for
the fiscal first half and that has become the total annual
payout. Last year, Elders paid a full-year total of 17.6
cents, adjusted for a free-share issue. The company said it
expects to pay a dividend on its preference shares.
   Elders's directors said they are taking the write-offs now
to prepare the company to concentrate on its breweries in
Australia, Britain and Canada. The company, which will be
renamed Foster's Brewing Group Ltd., has been trying to sell
its nonbrewing assets for several months, but the sales have
gone slowly.

   While New Yorkers have been horrified in recent weeks by
stray-bullet shootings, the subway slaying of a Utah tourist
and other outbursts of violent crime, they have not been
alone. The increase in violent crime is not restricted to New
York.
   Across the country there have been shootings, knifings,
muggings and other acts of violence that have given rise to a
heightened national concern. Our ability to guarantee the
first civil right of every American -- the right to be free
from fear -- is now being severely tested.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There is a growing sense among the American people that
our criminal justice system is too laden with legal traps and
technicalities to deal effectively with the problem. I have
seen the system up close for more than 20 years. Violent
felons use legal technicalities to avoid the bar of justice,
and convicted murderers utilize outdated procedures to clog
our appeals courts and dodge society's verdict.
Unfortunately, repeated efforts to address fundamental
defects in our criminal justice system -- to put the rights
of victims on a par with those properly accused of criminal
behavior -- have historically been tossed aside in exchange
for quick political fixes that grab headlines but achieve
little. We cannot allow it to happen again.
   In May 1989, President Bush proposed a tough,
comprehensive approach to reducing violent crime, including
legislative proposals to get at needless exclusion of
evidence where the police act in good faith; increased
finality of judgment through habeas corpus reform; effective
capital punishment procedures; and enhanced penalties for
offenses committed with guns.
   Last summer, the budget side of the president's ambitious
program was enacted, and this summer the Senate acted to
address some of the flaws in our current system. The House is
now poised to take a giant step -- in the wrong direction.
   Before Congress adjourns, two versions of the Crime
Control Bill are to be considered on the floor of the House.
The differences between them are stark indeed. On one side
are the president's proposals, which would restore to the
federal government an enforceable death penalty such as 37
states have had for years, allow the courts to consider all
evidence gathered by the police when they have made good
faith efforts to do their difficult jobs, and help curb the
maze of duplicative appeals that serve to postpone the
execution of convicted murderers for years.
   On the other side is the Judiciary Committee's bill, which
is an anti-crime bill in name only. For example, provisions
of the committee's bill would effectively abolish capital
punishment in the U.S. by requiring prosecutors asking for
the death penalty to address issues of racial statistics in
capital cases, instead of focusing on fairness in individual
cases.
   This provision probably not only would preclude the future
imposition of the death penalty, but would invalidate
virtually every capital sentence now in effect. It would not
matter how many aggravating factors were at work. If the
statistics didn't balance, and one racial group received a
disproportionate share of death sentences, the death penalty
would effectively be eliminated as a sanction.
   No prosecutor or judge worthy of the task ever takes race,
ethnicity, sex or religion into account in making a decision
in a particular case. Facts, and facts alone, should dictate
the course of a criminal investigation, its subsequent
prosecution, and the imposition of an appropriate sentence.
It would be both unconscionable and unconstitutional for it
to be otherwise. Yet the bill creates an incentive for
prosecutors to consider race to "fill the quota."
   Unlike the administration's version, the committee's bill
does not place meaningful limits on repetitive appeals,
mainly through habeas corpus petitions, which frustrate the
ends of justice and needlessly consume court time with claims
unrelated to guilt or innocence. Nor does it adequately
protect police officers who, despite their best efforts, are
later found to have run afoul of a legal technicality or
complex search-and-seizure requirement.
   In 1984, in U.S. v. Leon, the Supreme Court decided that
evidence obtained through "good faith" searches and seizures
pursuant to technically defective warrants would be
admissible as evidence of guilt. Most of us in law
enforcement hailed this decision, and we have ever since
tried to extend it, logically, to include warrantless
searches as well. We do not believe that evidence should be
suppressed and society should suffer when a policeman or
federal agent makes an honest mistake. And yet the
committee's bill would have just that effect. It does not
even pretend to extend the Leon exception and, while its
supporters would have us believe that the bill codifies Leon,
its actual words fall well short of what the Supreme Court
now permits.
   True reform, not a sham bill, is necessary to protect the
right of Americans to be free from fear in their homes, on
their streets and in their communities.

   On Records: McRae Sings Monk

   Minton's, a Harlem nightclub, was home in the early 1940s
for young musicians who were, it seemed, not so much
expanding as dismantling jazz traditions. Charlie Parker,
Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell and Kenny Clarke, among others,
were creating jagged, explosive, continually surprising
rhythms and dizzyingly complex harmonies that seemed to
collide with themselves. The melody? It was there, somewhere,
if you could piece together the fragments as they whizzed by.
   But there was a melodist among them. Pianist-composer
Thelonious Monk was as disdainful of mass popular taste as
his colleagues; but as startlingly unexpected as his rhythms
and harmonies were, his melodic lines were so clear, strong
and often witty that they stayed in the mind.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the early 1950s, though most of the earlier pioneers
were now playing downtown for slightly more money, Minton's
was still alive. I started going up there to hear the
intermission pianist, Carmen McRae, who still played there
occasionally.
   She also sang, just as she played -- crisp, precise (you
could hear the commas in the lyrics), with a sure, playful
beat. Then as now, she had the bearing of someone who had no
patience with small talk, small minds or people with
intrusive personal questions. When pressed beyond annoyance,
she could shoot you with her eyes.
   McRae had been intrigued by Thelonious Monk's music from
the time Minton's had been the boy equivalent of King
Arthur's Round Table. She had been married to the pervasively
influential modern drummer, Kenny Clarke, and so, she says,
"I was in on the ground floor." For a long time, there were
those -- older jazz critics, for instance -- who found Monk's
pieces and playing strange, forbidding, lacking a center of
gravity. McRae, however, found that reaction
incomprehensible. "His music," she told me recently, "made me
smile."
   For a long time, she has wanted to make an album of Monk's
works, with lyrics added, but she doubted that any record
label would be interested. RCA/Novus, however, proved her
wrong, and the resulting album is "Carmen McRae: Carmen Sings
Monk."
   Preparing to record the album, McRae listened to tapes of
his recordings "for hours and hours -- in my car, in hotel
rooms on the road, in my bed at night. I lived with that
music."
   Getting inside the music meant that she had to learn "how
the melodies were really meant to go, not the way I thought
they went. In fact, nothing went where you thought it was
going to go." Her knowledge of the piano -- which included
five years of classical studies starting when she was eight
-- helped a lot in understanding how Monk constructed his
lines and chords.
   "I'm sure," she says now that the album is done and she's
including some of the songs in her concert repertory, "that
Monk never had a vocalist in mind for his songs. If he had,
he wouldn't have made them so hard."
   On the album, she doesn't sound as if Monk is any harder
to sing than Jerome Kern. In all these years, I've never
heard McRae sound anything but coolly self-assured. Sometimes
she's been too cool, as if the music wasn't worth her full
attention, but here she's clearly enjoying the experience of
being stretched by Monk's music.
   He had no patience with musicians who complained that his
music was too hard. On one recording session, Coleman Hawkins
and John Coltrane were having trouble reading his music. Monk
walked over to Hawkins and said, "You're the great Coleman
Hawkins, the guy who invented the tenor saxophone, right?"
And to Coltrane: "You're the great John Coltrane, right?"
Monk paused. "Well, the music is on the horn. Between the two
of you, you should be able to find it."
   Carmen McRae found it. With a wit as crisp and pungent as
Monk's, she illuminates the fun in some of the songs. A far
more accomplished musician than many singers, she is able to
become a member of the band, not just a singer, without
trying to imitate an instrument. Her natural phrasing and
time blend with those of the sidemen. And her presence is so
authoritative that it might have impressed the inscrutable
Monk himself.
   The songs include such essential parts of the Monk canon
as "Well, You Needn't," "Rhythm-a-ning," "Ask Me Now,"
"Pannonica," "Ugly Beauty," "'Round Midnight" and "Straight,
No Chaser."
   The lyrics -- by Jon Hendricks, Sally Swisher, Abbey
Lincoln, Bernie Hanighen and Mike Ferro -- are not candidates
for anthologies. But like her good friend Billie Holiday,
McRae's sound phrasing and time are so arresting that the
lyrics take on connotations that the writer never had in
mind. Also, there is the powerful undertow of Monk's music.
   McRae has chosen an especially attentive and intelligent
group of sidemen: Saxophonists Clifford Jordan and, on two
tracks, Monk alumnus Charlie Rouse; bassist George Mraz, a
consistently luminous musician; alternating pianists Eric
Gunnison and Larry Wills; and drummer Al Foster.
   "Everything fits so well in Monk's work," John Coltrane
said, "Once you get to see the inside" -- the inner voicings
and rhythms. These are compositions, not just tunes.
   One night, when Coltrane was playing with Monk, he came
off the stand looking desolate. "I missed one of those turns
on the inside," he told me, "and it was like falling down an
empty elevator shaft."
   In "Carmen Sings Monk," there are no casualties. When his
music was going good, Monk would get up from the piano and
dance. Some said it was to make his rhythmic imperatives
clearer to his musicians. Some said that he was just feeling
so good he had to move. There are many passages in this set
during which it's difficult not to move.

   An Abundance of Nudes

   Philadelphia -- At a time when most museums are
preoccupied with broad and exhaustive -- and frequently
exhausting -- blockbuster shows, small and focused temporary
exhibitions are as welcome as they are rare. A good case in
point is the lovely little show that the Philadelphia Museum
of Art has built around a picture from its own collection,
Pierre-Auguste Renoir's "The Great Bathers," which the artist
worked on between 1884 and 1887. This popular painting is one
of Renoir's largest and most striking depictions of female
nudes. It also is a painting that gave him a good deal of
trouble and that marked an important turning point in his
art.
   For the occasion, the museum has regrouped its own fine
Renoir collection and augmented it with a number of works
borrowed from other museums and private collectors --
including some 25 preparatory studies for "The Great
Bathers." This condensed overview of the artist's work not
only provides a good deal of pleasure but also says a lot
about the particular historical and psychological context in
which "The Great Bathers" was done. The inclusion of both his
fluidly lyrical early pictures and of his late monumental
nudes allows us to see where he was coming from when he
painted "The Great Bathers," and where he eventually ended
up.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The exhibition makes it clear that despite its typical
Renoir subject -- buxom young women cavorting in an
unblemished landscape -- "The Great Bathers" is stylistically
one of the artist's most unusual paintings.
   The two largest figures are more artificially posed than
is normal in Renoir's work and there are considerable
technical differences in the rendering of the figures, the
water and the trees. The women are crisply drawn and smoothly
modeled, in a manner distinctly at odds with the more freely
brushed impressionistic rendering of the landscape, and the
stylized and somewhat stilted composition contains strong
echoes of the old masters. Moreover, the laborious
preparatory studies that Renoir did for the picture, and his
repeated reworking of the figures, also were departures from
the usual impressionist practice of working quickly and
spontaneously.
   Renoir's attempt to distance himself from impressionism in
this picture was quite deliberate. In fact, like many other
avant-garde artists in the mid-1880s, he was plagued by
doubts about the insubstantiality of the impressionist style
and was seeking a more solid and more classical approach to
painting.
   One of the most striking moments in the show is the
installation on one wall of three paintings of nudes that
clearly show how Renoir's thinking developed in the decade
before he painted "The Great Bathers." The first is "Nude in
Sunlight" of 1875, a voluptuous figure that is nearly
engulfed by the dappled light and luxuriant vegetation that
surround her. In "Blonde Bather" of 1881, by contrast, the
light is more even and the figure is more clearly detached
from the surrounding landscape.
   In "Seated Bather" of 1883-84, the drawing of the figure
is decidedly more linear and the landscape functions merely
as a kind of decorative backdrop, indicating Renoir's growing
uneasiness about strict impressionist practice.
   This uncertainty about impressionism took a rather
particular turn, for it led him to question his general
ability as an artist. "I had wrung impressionism dry," he
later said, "and I finally came to the conclusion that I knew
neither how to paint or draw." (To which some might say,
"Well, it was about time he realized that." For Renoir is
doubtless the most uneven of the major impressionists, and
occasionally his drawing and modeling are almost unbelievably
inept.) Leaving aside the ironic truth contained in the
hyperbolic rhetoric of his complaint, during the mid-1880s
Renoir was intensely anxious about how he stood up to the old
masters. In a sense, "The Great Bathers" can be seen as a
kind of test of his abilities.
   Just how assiduously Renoir worked at trying to get this
picture right -- and "to beat Raphael," as he told a friend
-- is clear from the great variety of the studies that he did
for it. These range in size and style from large, broadly
worked compositional sketches to small pencil drawings that
are as tightly rendered as an Ingres. Throughout the studies,
you sense a tension between impulsiveness and a will to
discipline, between a letting-go and a reining-in.
   This unresolved split shines through the final painting,
which is at once both sensual and cool, energetic and oddly
stiff. In fact, if "The Great Bathers" is a masterpiece, it
attains that status in large part because of its flaws and
inconsistencies, which give our experience of it a grittiness
that it might not otherwise have had.
   "The Great Bathers," moreover, seems to have intensified
Renoir's interest in the kind of sculptural form that emerges
in his best late paintings. In a nice touch, the last gallery
also contains some of the sculptures that Renoir did during
the last decade of his life, in collaboration with the
youthful Richard Guino, who obviously provided the arthritic
artist with more than just a sensitive pair of hands.
   Also in this gallery is the superb "Bather" that Renoir
painted around 1905, one of the best of his late pictures of
nudes. Here monumentality, sensuality and sheer painterly
skill are combined and harmonized with a mastery only hinted
at in "The Great Bathers."
   The exhibition will be on view until Nov. 25. It is
accompanied by an informative special issue of the museum's
Bulletin, written by curator Christopher Riopelle, and was
sponsored by Atochem North America Foundation and the Pew
Charitable Trusts.

   In another sign that the boom in leveraged buy-outs has
come and gone, Citibank will soon lay off 100 workers in its
leveraged-lending unit and transfer hundreds of others,
according to a senior official at the bank.
   The move, expected to take place over the next two weeks,
is the first in a series of reductions aimed at slashing $250
million to $300 million in annual expenses in the sector
serving corporations in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Other
Citibank business units in the U.S. are expected to announce
cutbacks internally over the next six to eight weeks, with
other units outside the U.S. announcing similar moves and
restructurings in the first quarter of next year.

   Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, has about 450 persons in its
Leveraged Capital division. The majority of those remaining
will be transferred along with their clients to existing
units that promote the full range of the bank's service, said
Todd Slotkin, a Citibank senior corporate finance executive.
Citibank has leveraged lending offices in five other U.S.
cities besides New York.
   "The leveraged buy-out market is down about 50% this year
and the outlook is flat for another year or so," said Mr.
Slotkin, who confirmed rumors about the cutbacks. He added
that the conflict in the Mideast and further uncertainty over
the economy dashed a rebound in leveraged buy-outs this
summer. "August was almost a non-month" for leveraged
buy-outs, he said.
   Citibank's retrenchment in leveraged lending and expected
cutbacks in other areas of corporate finance is in line with
staff reductions in those areas at other major banks and on
Wall Street. Bankers Trust cut 75 professional employees from
its 750 person professional corporate finance staff in June.
And Chemical Bank reduced staffing in those areas as part of
a 1,100 staff rollback in February.
   On Wall Street, about 200 investment bankers specializing
in leveraged buy-outs have lost their jobs at major firms
since the first of the year, estimates Perrin Long of Lipper
Analytical Services.
   Ironically, leveraged lending is not one of the areas
slated for cutbacks at Chase Manhattan Bank, which announced
Friday plans to reduce staff by 5,000. Chase did not build up
as large a full-time leveraged-lending staff as Citibank, and
it handles a broader mix of financing alternatives, including
infusions of equity, said Maria Beechey, head of merchant
banking at Chase. In addition, she said, "There still are a
significant number of middle market leveraged buy-outs that
are keeping us busy."
   The cutbacks are part of a business-by-business scrutiny
at Citibank that has been underway for the past two months.
It is expected by analysts to reduce the 15,000 person staff
of the wholesale banking division for the developed world by
at least 1,000 persons.

   GAITHERSBURG, Md. -- Optelecom Inc. said its president and
chief operating officer, George Konkol, will retire as soon
as the company chooses a successor.
   Mr. Konkol, who will be 67 years old next month, joined
the maker of communications equipment and laser systems in
1985. He said his departure isn't for health reasons or
because of any unhappiness about his relationship with the
company.

<TEXT>
   "I've been here five years now," he said, "and I think a
young, vigorous company like this one should have younger
leadership." He noted that William H. Culver, Optelecom's
chairman and chief executive officer, is 64.
   After his successor is named, the company said, Mr. Konkol
will serve as a consultant "for a period of time to be
mutually agreed upon."
   Optelecom said its board has formed a search committee
that is "actively reviewing" candidates.

   We see where California's Senator Alan Cranston has rushed
forward to attract news coverage as the first Member of the
Senate to announce his intention to vote against David
Souter's Supreme Court nomination; Mr. Souter didn't sign the
necessary blood oaths on behalf of abortions. Surely there is
something more appropriate Senator Cranston can do with his
political capital. Why not help bail out Charlie Keating, the
S&amp;L impresario, now languishing in a California jail for want
of $5 million bail. In the process of seeking senatorial
intervention with the thrift regulators, Mr. Keating
contributed nearly $1 million to Mr. Cranston's
voter-registration operation. With Mr. Keating now pleading
poverty, perhaps Senator Cranston could disgorge some of the
earlier distributions to help poor Charlie make bail.

   HONG KONG HIRING CONTROVERSY

   A decision by the Hong Kong government to open the British
colony's labor market to Chinese nationals living overseas
has been welcomed by the local business community but has
prompted questions about the government's motives.
   The government said it hoped that allowing Chinese
nationals to seek employment with Hong Kong companies would
help offset the steady departure of professionals from the
territory in the run-up to 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to
Chinese rule. Political observers and others outside the
government, however, said local authorities have bowed to
Beijing's demands that they allow an increased flow of
Chinese nationals into the territory.
   Under current regulations, mainland Chinese enter the Hong
Kong labor market by only two routes: a one-way immigrant
visa, granted to 75 Chinese nationals each day; or
sponsorship by a mainland employer operating in the
territory. Under the new policy, Chinese nationals who have
lived overseas for at least the past two years may apply for
jobs with private Hong Kong companies.
   Separately, Hong Kong Tourist Association Chairman Martin
Barrow disclaimed an earlier zero-growth forecast for 1990
tourism and predicted 8% growth instead. He cited gains in
arrivals from Southeast Asian countries and from Taiwan,
Japan and South Korea.
                                                                                                       

   SPANISH THEME-PARK ROW
                                                                                                       

   In a last-minute effort to salvage plans by Anheuser-Busch
Cos. to build a multimillion-dollar theme park and resort in
northeastern Spain, a top official with the Catalonian
regional government is traveling to St. Louis for direct
talks with the U.S. brewing company. The city of
Vilaseca-Salou, in which the project was to be built,
recently split into two warring municipalities, one of which
now refuses to allow the park to be built within city limits.
Anheuser-Busch last month threatened to relocate the project.
                                                                                                       

   EAST BLOC REQUEST FOR HONDA
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Honda Motor Co. said that state-owned motorcycle
companies in the Soviet Union and Poland have asked it to
provide technical support for their operations. Honda is
studying the feasibility of offering such support, a
spokesman said, adding that the companies are interested in
Honda's small-engine technology.
                                                                                                       

   HELPING THE MIDEAST'S MIGRANTS
                                                                                                       

   The International Labor Organization said it plans to send
teams to several countries with large migrant communities in
Iraq and Kuwait to assess financial losses of workers
returning home. The Geneva-based United Nations agency urged
the world to heed the plight of migrant workers in the
Persian Gulf region. Among the countries the ILO teams will
visit are Egypt and the Philippines.
                                                                                                       

   WARNINGS FROM ARGENTINA
                                                                                                       

   The director of Argentina's state telephone company said
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. wouldn't be given more time to
line up cash and debt papers it needs to take over a section
of Entel Oct. 8. Manufacturers Hanover Vice President Cesar
Deimonas told Radio Mitre the consortium led by the bank
hadn't formally requested an extension, and "we think we can
put together" the funds in time. Separately, Argentina's
public-works minister said that the Spanish airline Iberia
and its Argentine partner have three days to come up with a
$130 million down payment for 85% of the national carrier
Aerolineas Argentinas or lose the bid.
                                                                                                       

   VIETNAMESE-SOUTH KOREAN LINKS
                                                                                                       

   Vietnamese officials have proposed the opening of
Vietnamese and South Korean trade offices in Seoul and Hanoi
to help expand trade relations between the two nations. The
officials, in Seoul for a trade and investment seminar, said
foreign businesses participating in Vietnam's reconstruction
would be given tax and other benefits.
                                                                                                       

   BRITAIN'S ANTI-POLLUTION PACKAGE
                                                                                                       

   The British government unveiled a package designed to curb
pollution of the air, land and waters.
   Draft legislation, promised by the ruling Conservatives
for more than two years, pledged to spend $53 billion on
environmental protection measures by the year 2000.
   The 300-page document outlined 350 proposals for tackling
increasing pollution but contained no surprises and repeated
many prior commitments. Among those are a drive to improve
water quality and a pledge to phase out ozone-depleting gases
by 1997.
   Environmental groups attacked the plans as "too little,
too late." But Environment Minister Chris Patten described
the paper as the "first really comprehensive statement of
government policy on the environment, ranging from the street
corner to the stratosphere."
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   A banknote denominated at one million British pounds,
printed just after World War II but no longer legal tender,
will be auctioned in London next month. The note, used by the
British Treasury as a record of the movement of money from
the Marshall Aid Fund, is expected to fetch up to $56,500. .
. . Tanzania announced the arrest of 2,500 poachers and the
seizure of 11,000 weapons and 3,000 elephant tusks in a
two-year anti-poaching campaign. Wildlife Director Costa Mlay
said most of the poachers arrested had either been fined or
sent to jail for terms ranging from five to 22 years.

   Officials Assail Early Census Results,
   Call Effort `a $2.6 Billion Colossal Flop'

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Mayors, congressmen and regional officials
from around the country dismissed the preliminary 1990 census
count as woefully low, with representatives of the Conference
of Mayors calling the effort "a $2.6 billion colossal flop."
   In testimony before the House subcommittee that oversees
the Census Bureau, officials offered a laundry list of
complaints about inaccuracies in the count.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We have been promised the most accurate census count in
history," Rep. Mike Espy (D., Miss.) testified, but added
that even Mississippi's governor and secretary of state were
missed. "If the preliminary numbers are any indication, we
may be on the verge of the most inaccurate count in history,"
he said.
   The preliminary count, the bureau insists, is incomplete
and designed to be only one step in the long process toward a
full count. Nonetheless, many cities and some rural areas are
up in arms as lower-than-expected figures threaten
congressional apportionment and federal spending.
   While the current round of accusations may have little
effect on the final 1990 count, it presages a lengthy season
of litigation ahead. The Commerce Department, which has
authority over the Census Bureau, was sued 52 times over
alleged errors in the count and bureau's methods in the 1980
census.
   On Monday, some cities and localities returned their own
estimates of how many housing units the bureau supposedly
missed. The process, known as post-census local review, gives
cities and localities 15 days to review the bureau's
preliminary figures so they can tell the bureau where they
may have missed housing units. The census bureau then
recanvasses some of those areas.
   For confidentiality and other reasons, the bureau releases
to local officials only the number of housing units within
blocks the bureau itself designates, rather than the number
of people within each block. This presents an important
obstacle in redressing the count, local officials say,
because a missed unit -- such as a college dormitory or a
group house -- often misses many people, magnifying errors
and omissions.
   Officials said the 15-day review period isn't enough. They
also said that advanced survey methodology has rendered the
constitutionally mandated head count obsolete. "The fact of
the matter is, we have reached the point where scientific
projections are more accurate than counting," Baltimore Mayor
Kurt Schmoke said.
   Barbara Bryant, director of the Census Bureau, addressed
many of the concerns during her testimony and defended the
bureau's integrity. "We sympathized with those officials who
have to govern cities losing or not gaining population and
tax base," she said, "but we should not be blamed for such
changes. In effect, there should be no shooting of the
proverbial messenger in anticipation of bad news."
   Mr. Schmoke expressed the desire of many of the mayors
when he called on the Census Bureau to allow the cities one
last chance to correct the count before it goes to the
president next spring. But Ms. Bryant said that wouldn't be
possible because federal law requires that the final count be
done by the federal government alone: "This," she said in
reference to the local review, "was their chance to give
their counts."
   According to Ms. Bryant, seven cities have contested the
housing count in at least 2,000 blocks. The seven are
Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Honolulu, New York and
Philadelphia. New York has voiced the loudest complaint of
the major cities, claiming that more than 250,000 housing
units and as many as one million people were missed in the
preliminary count.

   In Oregon, a Little-Known Challenger Believes
   Sen. Hatfield Can't See the Forest for the Trees

   CAMP SHERMAN, Ore. -- On the surface, Republican Sen. Mark
Hatfield is in a commanding position as November's election
approaches. A fixture in Oregon politics who seems to mirror
the state's progressive political traditions, he holds a big
lead against a little-known challenger.
   But in a season when the breezes of antagonism against
politicians sometimes get whipped into a gale, Sen. Hatfield
suddenly is on the defensive.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This week Oregon voters are digesting allegations that
Sen. Hatfield's longtime, Oregon-based aide, Gerald Frank,
had traveled widely at taxpayers' expense, including 52
visits in the past four years to New York, where he publishes
a guidebook on shops and restaurants. Bill Calder, Mr.
Hatfield's spokesman, says that there may be an "appearance
of impropriety" but that the public hasn't underwritten any
of the expenses for Mr. Frank's personal business trips.
   Mr. Calder calls the allegations against Mr. Frank "a
politically inspired attack." He says that the aide's travel
was "entirely legitimate, done in an above-board way," and
that "there have been no violations of Senate rules."
   The aide's peripatetic travel, first reported by Portland
television station KATU-TV, comes as Mr. Hatfield's
Democratic challenger, Bend businessman Harry Lonsdale, is
calling the senator a "timber beast" and a "timber pawn" --
fighting words in Oregon, where the timber industry provides
a third of the state's personal income but where concern over
environmental issues is deepening.
   The debates over Mr. Frank and timber are being conducted
at a distance because Mr. Hatfield refuses to face his
opponent and because -- a potentially dangerous decision in a
year when politicians are being labeled out of touch -- the
senator hasn't even set foot in the state in more than three
weeks and probably won't return until Congress goes out of
session, which could be another four weeks.
   But now Mr. Lonsdale is preparing a new offensive,
concentrating on Mr. Frank's ties to the American Federal
Savings &amp; Loan Association, which was bailed out by the
federal government at a cost of $113 million. Mr. Frank, who
left the thrift's board before regulators stepped in, says he
didn't think Sen. Hatfield knew he was involved with the S&amp;L
-- whose board once included GOP Rep. Denny Smith of Oregon,
now considered vulnerable.
   The result is that Mr. Hatfield, who is holding a
two-to-one lead in the polls, is emerging as the classic
example of a popular candidate who could become the victim of
an anti-incumbency backlash. Already Massachusetts Democrats
selected John Silber, a symbol of protest against the
political establishment, as their gubernatorial nominee,
while Oklahoma voters approved a measure to limit legislators
to 12 years in office.
   For months Mr. Lonsdale has been building support by
tapping into resentment about how the state, a sylvan empire
that provides a fifth of the nation's softwood and forest
products, has been scarred by the vast patches of
clear-cutting that are visible from precipices in the Mount
Hood National Forest and in the Willamette National Forest.
   A political neophyte who can grow dewy-eyed over a Pacific
silver fir tree, Mr. Lonsdale, 58 years old, has never voted
against Sen. Hatfield. But now he's taking on not only Mr.
Hatfield, one of the ponderosa pines of politics, but also
Oregon's timber industry, the keystone of the state's
economy. At the center of his campaign is his proposal to ban
log exports from private lands.
   Mr. Lonsdale is calculating that he's more than a voice
crying out in the wilderness of the rugged Deschutes National
Forest here in central Oregon. He's arguing that prohibiting
the log trade with Japan is the answer to the state's
economic challenges and the way to protect the towering
700-year-old trees that give the state its character and
identity.
   It might work. "There's this instinctual feeling that
people don't want these logs exported," says K. Norman
Johnson, a forest economist at Oregon State University.
   In a state that is agonizing over the fate of the
endangered northern spotted owl and the 20,000 jobs it may
cost to preserve its ancient-forest habitat of heavy tree
canopies and its prey of woodrats and flying squirrels, the
complex economics of the log trade has become part of the
argot of politics.
   Although the Japanese can buy finished lumber products
cheaper than they can buy Oregon's raw logs, they purchase
the logs to keep their own workers employed. What's more,
they're willing to pay a premium price for them; last year
Japanese timber importers seeking Douglas fir, the coveted
giant conifers that can have diameters as big as 16 feet,
paid an average wholesale price of $604 per thousand board
feet -- more than double the domestic U.S. price of $263.50.
   Mr. Lonsdale's plan is to end these exports, thereby
limiting the timber cuts. Then, to ensure that the state's
logs provide jobs for Oregonians rather than Japanese, he'd
switch the emphasis of the timber industry from cutting and
exporting logs to manufacturing modular homes, wooden doors,
window frames and other lumber products.
   Mr. Hatfield, chary of banning log exports and interfering
with private property rights, wants to use economic
incentives -- a 15% capital-gains tax break for timber
companies -- to keep logs onshore. "They'll cut less because
they'll have an economic incentive to do different things,"
he says in an interview in Washington. "The result will be
more jobs."
   Mr. Lonsdale's initiative, made in a setting where
business looks naturally to the Pacific, is itself something
of a gamble. Portland is one of the principal unloading
points for Japanese automobiles and a major export point for
grain and flour along with timber products. A Japanese
semiconductor plant employs 475 workers in Gresham, just east
of Portland. Oregon, moreover, has run a trade surplus with
Japan for the past two years.
   Mr. Hatfield says his opposition to the Lonsdale plan is
consistent with his philosophy of "balance" in the forests
that cover nearly half the state. "The middle ground is where
the people are," he says. "The extremists get the simple
slogans -- `ban log exports' -- but there's more to this
question than chanting slogans."
   But the senator is drawing unusually strong enmity from
environmentalists, some of whom have chained themselves to a
tree outside his Portland office, and from his rival's
campaign, which is charging that Mr. Frank's ownership of
timber stock raises important ethical questions. Mr. Calder,
the Hatfield spokesman, says the stock issue is "outrageous"
and an indicator of how "desperate" the Lonsdale camp is.
   His critics argue that Mr. Hatfield, the powerful ranking
Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, pushes for
higher timber-cutting targets than the Forest Service and the
Bureau of Land Management request. "He's the single most
serious threat to the environment we have here, the biggest
devastator of the forest," argues James Monteith, executive
director of the Oregon Natural Resources Council.
   Such jarring language is incongruous in a state known for
its tidy politics, especially when the invective is directed
at Mr. Hatfield, former two-term governor who has held public
office for four decades and who would, if he wins a fifth
Senate term this autumn, become the longest-serving senator
in the state's history.
   Mr. Hatfield, 68, has made a career of blazing his own
political trail, seldom suffering when he wanders off into
the wilderness. He was the only dissenter in a National
Governors' Association resolution supporting Lyndon Johnson
during the early days of the Vietnam War and later lent his
name to the McGovern-Hatfield Amendment to end the war. He
attacked the Nixon administration for practicing the
"politics of revulsion" and was skeptical of many Reagan
administration initiatives.
   Deeply religious, Sen. Hatfield presided over the Reagan
defense buildup as appropriations chairman when the GOP
controlled the Senate, but, because of his commitment to
peace, he never voted for a defense authorization bill. Today
he opposes abortion, breaking with Oregon voters, who support
abortion rights by large margins. "People in Oregon
understand this," he says. "They thought I was wrong on
Vietnam then and some think I'm wrong on abortion. But they
know my pattern."
   Today he sticks to his own path despite cries from
newspaper editorialists that he should debate Mr. Lonsdale.
"He's arrogant, above it all -- St. Mark, the senator from
Heaven," Mr. Lonsdale says in frustration. The question about
Mr. Frank's travel records hadn't appeared through
yesterday's editions of the the state's biggest newspaper,
the Portland Oregonian, where the aide writes a nonpolitical
column.
   "I have knowledge of my opponent of course," Mr. Hatfield
says. "But I don't mention him by name, and I don't lambaste
him. That's my style. I consider a campaign a time to talk
about my record and my involvement in the life of Oregon. Why
should I talk about my opponent?"

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices rebounded from Monday's sell-off
as oil prices retreated and speculators who had bet that
stocks would keep falling rushed to cut their losses.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 32.67 points in
moderate trading to 2485.64, but advancing issues on the New
York Stock Exchange barely outnumbered decliners, 770-745.

   The slump in oil-crude oil futures for November delivery
fell 72 cents a barrel to $37.53 -- also boosted bond prices,
though trading was light. The dollar rose against the mark
and fell against the yen on a West German official's comment
that the yen could strengthen against European currencies.
   Peter G. Grennan, head of stock index futures trading at
Shearson Lehman Brothers, said yesterday's rally was fueled
mainly by short-sellers -- investors who had bet on a further
decline from Monday's level. When a drop failed to
materialize, these investors sought to trim their losses by
buying back shares.
   Oil's drop attracted some bargain hunters to stocks, and
they pushed prices high enough to spark the short-covering
rally.
   Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis group
at Salomon Brothers, said he wasn't surprised to see the
rebound. He explained that Monday's drop -- in which the Dow
Jones industrials lost 59.41 points to close at their lowest
level of the year -- came on less volume and with fewer
stocks reaching new lows than on Aug. 23, the day of the
industrials' previous 1990 low. Trading "will remain very
choppy," he said, "but the downside risk is starting to
diminish."
   But others weren't convinced yesterday's rally has staying
power. "The broad list of stocks continues to receive a
considerable amount of selling pressure even during sporadic
short-term rally attempts," said Mr. Grennan at Shearson.
   Jack Solomon, market technician at Bear Stearns, said he
has noticed increased investor interest in shorting stocks --
or borrowing shares and selling them, in hope of profiting
from a price decline. "Everybody wants to go short who never
went short before," he said.
   But Mr. Solomon also said that oil won't rise further for
the time being; he noted that oil-company stocks haven't
followed oil to higher prices.
   In fact, Sal Gilbertie, an oil futures trader at Merrill
Lynch, said Monday's surge in oil was a "purely emotional
high based on war fears" in the Middle East. Yesterday,
common sense -- and profit-taking -- prevailed. "There are
ample levels of heating oil in the world," Mr. Gilbertie
said. "New York harbor is filled to the brim with tankers
loaded with heating oil."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose. Big Board volume was 155.9 million
shares.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face
amount. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
eased to 9.13%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.5725 marks, up from 1.5590 late
Monday, and at 136.72 yen, down from 137.35.

   A Deathbed Letter From Cape Town

   Deathbed utterances, like suicide notes, are a powerful
coinage, stamped by an awareness that words can outlive us.
J.M. Coetzee's latest novel, "Age of Iron" (Random House, 198
pages, $18.95), is built on just such an awareness: the
privilege of the dead, or the dying, to carry on in words.
Set in South Africa, it is the narrative of a retired
classics professor who is dying of cancer, and who devotes
the final weeks of her life to writing a long, last letter to
her only child, a daughter who has moved to America.
   But if the dying Mrs. Curren, a widowed white liberal
living alone in Cape Town, had expected to pen a letter free
of the contagion of apartheid and full of the certainties of
the educated, that illusion is shattered when she returns
from the doctor. Reeling from the news of her cancer, she
discovers an alcoholic vagrant camped in an alley beside her
garage. Filthy, taciturn, alternately sullen and solicitous,
the drunken Vercueil, whose race is never specified, is
destined to become the unlikely helpmate, confessor and
surrogate lover of her final days. And as the man to whom she
eventually entrusts the letter to be delivered to her
daughter, he is destined too to become her angel of
annunciation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When Mrs. Curren's black housemaid, Florence, later
arrives with her two daughters and her 15-year-old son,
Bheki, the festering consequences of apartheid begin slowly
to impinge on her world. The housemaid explains that she has
brought Bheki with her, because, "he will get into trouble"
in the townships, where the schools have been set afire and
rebellion is "burning with a low flame." Bheki and a young
schoolmate, both hardened by the oppressions of apartheid,
are driven relentlessly by the iron indignation of the
victimized.
   But what seems at first only a domestic drama spirals
rapidly into a fierce pageant of modern South Africa. Mr.
Coetzee portrays with equal vigor the insidiousness of the
apartheid system and the moral astonishment of a woman who in
her dying days is forced to witness as well as participate in
it.
   Mrs. Curren is outraged that her housemaid accepts with
placid fatalism the way in which her son and his schoolmate
have been radicalized by struggle in the townships. "Be
careful: They may start by being careless of their own lives
and end by being careless of everyone else's," she tells her.
To Florence's boast that they are "children of iron" living
in an age in which there are "no more mothers and fathers,"
Mrs. Curren pleads for the constant necessity of moral
authority. "You wash your hands of them and they turn into
the children of death," she says.
   To be sure, Mr. Coetzee has in mind more than a little
lesson on how decent societies are built on good households,
for it is clear as events unfold that no individual in the
body politic can immunize South Africa from the cancer that
is killing it. Bheki, and then his companion, are shot to
death by white policemen in separate incidents that flow so
smoothly from the logic of blind hatred that one is baffled
that the deaths can be viewed as anything but the inevitable
mechanisms of a corrupt society. Still, Mrs. Curren plunges
forward in her private crusade, scuffling with police
officers, screaming of injustice, raging like an impotent
Lear, convinced to the bitter end that shame put to words
will right the world.
   And all the while, she is succumbing slowly, sometimes in
moments of drugged hallucination, to her own cancer. What
makes the novel so powerful is how skillfully Mr. Coetzee
weaves the tale Mrs. Curren tells of South Africa with the
old woman's tortured love of her own daughter, whom she
hasn't told she has cancer.
   In one passage, she tries to bridge the thousands of miles
separating them by imagining her daughter preparing dinner:
"She empties the peas into a bowl. She takes two onions and
begins to peel them. Imagine the peas, imagine the onions.
Imagine the world in which she is doing these things. . . . a
summer evening in North America, with gnats at the screen
door, children calling from down the street. Imagine my
daughter in her house, in her life, with an onion in one
hand, in a land where she will live and die in peace."
   Ironically, "Age of Iron," Mr. Coetzee's sixth novel, is
his most explicit about apartheid, and it is published at a
time when the system is yielding slowly, but finally, to
change. It is a remarkable work by a brilliant writer,
although it lacks the sustained, if at times lunatic
intensity of his earlier novels, "In the Heart of the
Country" and "Waiting for the Barbarians." There are moments
of uneven quality in Mrs. Curren's narrative that exist
nowhere else in Mr. Coetzee's fiction, but they are minor
blemishes.
   One is haunted on finishing the novel by a doubt that
plagues Mrs. Curren throughout this swan song to her
daughter: Will the vagrant Vercueil ever deliver it to her?
In that puzzle lies a central assertion of the novel -- that
the utterances of the doomed dignify our hope for
understanding, even if no one is around to hear them.

   Will Iraq, With World Help, Drop a Nuclear Bombshell?

   Just how close is Iraq to acquiring nuclear weapons?
Nobody knows for sure.
   Only nine months ago, Tel Aviv University's Jaffa Center
for Strategic Studies estimated that Iraq was "five to 10
years" from obtaining the bomb, with Iraqi progress in this
area constituting "a new level of the military threat"
hovering over the region. The U.S. intelligence community
agreed. But shortly before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the
Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency broke ranks and
revised its estimate downward. Iraq was now only "two to five
years" away from a nuclear capability, the DIA said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   France, which has closely monitored Iraq's nuclear
programs as one of its principal suppliers for many years,
has revised its estimate as well. In recent interviews,
French officials said they believed Iraq could "go nuclear"
in three years or more. One of their biggest worries is that
these facilities are so small that even the best
reconnaissance satellites might never pick them up, officials
said.
   Iraq's nuclear research program began in the early 1960s,
when the first Baathist government purchased an experimental
nuclear reactor from the U.S.S.R. To house the modest-sized
plant, Iraq built its first nuclear research center, some 15
miles south of Baghdad. Later, the Soviets upgraded this
light-water research reactor and trained at least 100 Iraqi
nuclear physicists. They also delivered three "hot cells"
capable of manipulating spent fuel, and built a laboratory
capable of producing medical radio-isotopes. But Leonid
Brezhnev refused subsequent Iraqi pleas to purchase more
advanced technology, and Iraq turned to France.
   In September 1975, Saddam met with Prime Minister Jacques
Chirac in Paris, to negotiate a wide range of arms-for-oil
deals. Among them was the purchase of two nuclear research
reactors. To the French, Saddam said he was interested in
civilian nuclear power. But in an interview with a Beirut
magazine, El Usbou el-Arabi, he described the agreement with
France as "the first concrete step toward the production of
the Arabic atomic weapon."
   The contract to purchase the Osiris and Isis reactors
(later designated as "Tammouz I" and "Tammouz II") was signed
in Baghdad two months later. These deliveries, coupled with
the sale by Italy in 1980 of four hot cells capable of
extracting weapons-grade plutonium from spent reactor fuel,
were considered so critical that in June 1981 Israel sent in
air force jets, which totally destroyed the core of the
Tammouz I reactor. Tammouz II, which was a scale model for
nuclear experiments, emerged intact and today appears to be
operational.
   Repeated attempts to convince the French to rebuild
Tammouz I have failed. And yet, Iraq continues its nuclear
weapons program unabated. Only now, these efforts are
occurring underground.
   At first, in the 1970s and early 1980s, the Iraqis built
large-scale nuclear plants capable of irradiating highly
enriched uranium, which could then be reprocessed in hot
cells to obtain weapons-grade plutonium. But not only were
the nuclear materials and equipment Iraq purchased subject to
International Atomic Energy Agency inspections, which
occurred every six months, but the installations themselves
were large, easy to identify, and difficult to defend.
   In 1983, Iraqi nuclear engineers changed tactics. Using a
clandestine technology-procurement network in Europe, Africa
and the Americas, they set about acquiring critical
technologies needed to build an indigenous uranium-enrichment
industry, based on gas centrifuges.
   This method involves turning large quantities of uranium
yellowcake into a gas, called uranium hexofluoride, and
spinning the gas in specially designed ultracentrifuges until
the desired level of purification can be obtained. Uranium
thus enriched to more than 90% can then be directly used to
build atomic weapons.
   Ultracentrifuge technology may be complex, but it is
widely available and relatively easy to conceal. Pakistan
seems to have taken this route; China mastered it; Brazil
opened its own ultracentrifuge enrichment plant two years
ago, using West German technology. All of these countries may
have contributed to the Iraqi program. And there is little
the IAEA or anyone else can do about it. These are
clandestine facilities, fueled by vast quantities of
unsafeguarded uranium yellowcake obtained from Niger, Brazil
and Portugal in the late 1970s, and extracted from Iraq's own
plant at al Qaim in recent years.
   Several warning lights have appeared recently, providing a
disturbing glimpse into Iraq's clandestine nuclear program:
   -- In March, British and American customs agents
coordinated to intercept 40 krytron nuclear triggers on their
way to Iraq. Krytrons are essential for detonating a nuclear
device.
   -- In July, in another joint British-American operation,
high-temperature "skull furnaces" manufactured by Consarc
Engineering, in Rancocas, N.J., were intercepted on their way
to Iraq. These furnaces can be used both for nuclear and
ballistic missile programs.
   -- In August, the Swiss firm Schmiedemeccanica tried to
deliver endcaps made of special maraging steel to Iraq.
Endcaps are a critical part of ultracentrifuges.
   -- Since 1987, a West German engineering firm, H&amp;H
Metalform, has been delivering to Iraq sophisticated
machine-tools capable of making ultracentrifuges in Iraq,
according to the German newsweekly Der Spiegel. In
conjunction with this crucial sale, which was never blocked,
Iraq has also purchased from West German and
French-controlled companies large quantities of the special
steels needed to manufacture the centrifuges.
   West European nuclear experts have little doubt: Iraq has
opted for the centrifuge technique, and the spate of recent
purchases proves Iraq's intentions.
   But even government nuclear experts admit they do not know
the full scope of the Iraqi purchases. "We see things getting
stopped, but we have no idea how much of it is actually
getting through," one French expert said. "We know the Iraqis
are masters of clandestine procurement, and they have an
extremely detailed shopping list. We see the pattern in their
purchases, but we can't see the timetable. They seem to be
buying whatever they can find whenever it becomes available."
   Iraq surprised the world once, in the development of its
indigenous ballistic missiles. Clearly, with his nuclear
ambitions, Saddam would like to surprise us again.

   Reebok Predicts Drop of 40 Cents a Share
   In Third-Period Profit, Flat Net for Year

   STOUGHTON, Mass. -- Despite strong sales of its inflatable
athletic shoe, the Pump, Reebok International Inc. is still
struggling to get into shape.
   The company predicted yesterday that its third-quarter
per-share earnings will be about 10 cents below a year
earlier and that earnings for the year will be flat. Analysts
pegged the quarterly decline in domestic sales at about $40
million, mostly because of the company's older-line aerobic
shoes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Company officials said about half the shortage was from
terminating accounts with distributors -- called diverters --
who order an oversupply of athletic shoes and then resell
them to discount stores that Reebok refuses to deal with.
   "There's no question that there has been softness in the
classic lines, our aerobic and freestyle shoes," said company
spokeswoman Kate Burnham. "But we think that the Pump
technology is sound and will carry us forward."
   "I wouldn't want to be in Reebok's shoes," said Alice
Ruth, an analyst with Montgomery Securities. "They've found
themselves in a shrinking market in which competition is
intense."
   Mostly, Reebok is playing one-on-one against Nike Inc. in
the performance shoe market and against L.A. Gear Inc. in
sneakers. The only clear winner is Nike, which analysts
expect to slightly increase its market share to 30% by
year-end, with Reebok at 22% and L.A. Gear in the high teens.
   A recent survey by Sporting Goods Business, a New
York-based industry trade magazine, asked 278 retailers which
brands they thought would be hot through 1990. First was Nike
with 86%, then L.A. Gear with 35% and Reebok with 31%. "It's
no surprise: Nike has been consistent in its management,
product and advertising," said Robert Carr, the magazine's
editor. "Over at Reebok, in terms of advertising and
distribution, things have been pretty confusing."
   While Nike's advertisements have been winning awards,
Reebok has gone through several advertising firms and still
lacks a strong, coherent message. Gary M. Jacobson, an
analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., notes that the company,
which is having distribution problems with the Pump, has a
15% backlog of unfilled orders -- its largest product backlog
in several years.
   But how much can Reebok squeeze from the Pump, which
accounts for about 10% of its domestic shoe revenue? After
growing 30% in 1988 and 13% in 1989, the $4.5 billion U.S.
athletic footwear market is expected to grow barely 10% this
year.
   Yet many analysts see the fierce domestic competition
easing as both Nike and Reebok continue to expand into
overseas markets. Reebok's international footwear revenues
are expected to hit $430 million by year-end, almost double
last year's total.
   "We're used to seeing Nike and Reebok fighting it out with
million-dollar ad campaigns," says Mr. Jacobson of Kidder
Peabody. "But over in Europe, remember, they have no one with
the revenues and advertising punch of either of these
companies."

   Moscow's Novice Traders Tour Pits
   To See the `Crazy House' in Action

   NEW YORK -- A delegation of Soviet Union businessmen, who
this month helped start the first commodity exchange in
Moscow since the mid-1920s, came to see Wall Street with
their own eyes.
   "It's a crazy house]" exclaims Victor Zaplatkin, a member
of the U.S.S.R. Chamber of Commerce, after gawking around the
New York Stock Exchange's trading floor for a few minutes
Monday afternoon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Big Board is a far cry from the embryonic Moscow
market. Last Wednesday, 200 Soviets gathered in a Moscow
office building to trade whatever any of them wanted to buy
and sell, which turned out to be mostly building materials,
such as cement and lumber. It resembled an auction more than
a Western-style securities or futures exchange.
   The Soviets knew they had a long way to go even before the
seven visitors ventured to Wall Street. One highlight of
their two-week tour: mock trading of platinum futures last
night on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   "It's better to see it done once than hear it a thousand
times," says Mr. Zaplatkin, quoting a Russian proverb.
   There are a few little problems to iron out back home
before the Moscow market goes big time, however. "Until we
resolve the question of property ownership, it will be hard
to resolve any market questions," says Gennadi Poleshuk,
co-chairman of the Moscow Commodity Exchange. He argues a
commodity exchange could help improve the Soviet Union's poor
system for distributing goods.
   Another difficulty is that to function properly, futures
markets need risk-takers -- also known as speculators, which
is an onerous term in the Soviet Union. Such activity is
illegal and people convicted of it are subject to stiff
prison sentences.
   A proposal to change the law on speculation has been
introduced, says Alexander Pochinok, a deputy of the Supreme
Soviet of the Russian Republic and secretary of the
commission on budget, taxes, securities and banking
legislation for the republic. "However," he adds, "it is much
more difficult to change the consciousness of the people."
   Konstantin Zatulin, a member of the board of the exchange
and head of an association of entrepreneurs, says the Soviet
people "are moving from a complete denial of the market -- an
attitude they held for 70 years -- to viewing it as their
salvation."
   To help them learn how markets work, the Soviets have
hired two Americans. One of them is Danielle Downing, a
recent Russian-speaking graduate from the MBA program at the
Wharton Business School, who is executive assistant to the
chairman of the new exchange and is based in Moscow.
   "I see the Moscow exchange developing in a pattern similar
to the way American exchanges developed," first trading
warehouse receipts for real bushels of grain or tons of
metal, then evolving into futures markets, she said. Her
boss, Mr. Poleshuk, predicts the new auction-type marketplace
will evolve into a futures market when goods become freely
priced, in five to seven years.
   John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry
Association, says he believes there would be world-wide
commercial interest in a Soviet futures market that traded
energy products, precious metals and the ruble.
   The government of the Russian Republic has passed a law
that, beginning late this year, will permit all Soviet
enterprises, but not individuals, to trade foreign
currencies. According to Ms. Downing, the Moscow exchange is
in good position to become one of the places where such
trading is permitted. It would start as a cash market for the
ruble against all the major Western currencies.

   Uncrowded Fields Have Hitches but May

   The builders of Bell Atlantic Corp.'s new tower in
Philadelphia had a tricky problem: finding 300,000 square
feet of red granite and a factory that would process the
stone in time to meet an exacting construction schedule.
   Help came from Malcolm Swenson, a man who knows his
quarries. He found a Swedish quarry that could produce the
type of granite needed at the right price and an Italian
factory that could process it quickly. The result: A lot of
rocks got a lot of travel. But the granite fabrication was
completed on schedule at a savings of $500,000 over Bell
Atlantic's initial $3 million cost projection, Mr. Swenson
says.

<TEXT>
   The entrepreneur runs a company based in Grantham, N.H.,
that fills a niche so narrow it scarcely exists: stone
consulting. While experts on entrepreneurship often advise
finding an uncrowded market niche, owners such as Mr. Swenson
profit handsomely by taking the advice about as far as it can
go.
   In New York, Arlen Lessin now runs a firm that advises
large corporations only on "managing innovation." In Beverly
Hills, Calif., entrepreneur Richard Myers is about to open a
Rodeo Drive store that will sell nothing but technically
advanced makeup and shaving mirrors -- for as much as $8,400
apiece.
   "Niche businesses can be very attractive," says Mary Ellen
Jay of Kenny, Kindler, Hunt &amp; Howe, a New York executive
search and consulting firm. "There isn't the need for as
significant an amount of capital as is often necessary in
going after larger markets. And it's far less competitive."
   Many of these niches are too small to accommodate more
than one or two competitors. There are psychic rewards too:
In a very narrow field, an entrepreneur might easily become
his region's -- and maybe even the world's -- leading expert.
   Niche businesses also provide more flexibility in the
price an entrepreneur can charge. "You are providing
something that no one else has," says Mr. Myers, whose
cheapest shaving mirror sells for $175.
   Entrepreneurs often find these narrow niches through work
in related fields. Mr. Swenson, the stone consultant, says
his grandfather emigrated from Sweden in the 1860s and
purchased a granite quarry in Concord, N.H., in 1883. Mr.
Swenson took over the family business in 1968 after receiving
an M.B.A. degree from Harvard Business School. But when the
company ran into trouble a few years later, he quit and began
helping to open quarries in China and the Middle East. Later,
Mr. Swenson worked for a large construction company and its
stone subsidiary. But he left in 1988 to launch Swenson Stone
Consultants with his brother, David. Their niche was to help
developers and their architects select and buy the right
stones.
   The Swensons say they keep tabs on every major quarry and
stone processing plant in the world and can save builders
time and money when it comes to rocks. When the developers of
New York's Equitable Tower had trouble finding a uniform
color of stone and the appropriate size, Mr. Swenson's firm
stepped in. They found a quarry in Brazil that could produce
the stone in the exact color and size needed. But to get the
marble processed in time, they had to find two separate
factories in two separate countries with identical polishing
methods.
   As stone expertise is none too common, the Swensons say
they get business from all over the world. With the U.S.
construction business in a slump, the company is working with
clients in England, France and Germany. Mr. Swenson says
clients paid the company more than $500,000 for its rock
advice last year.
   But esoteric niches have their problems too. "It's not
always clear to people what our business really is," says Mr.
Lessin, the "innovation facilitator." He spends a lot of time
explaining that innovation management involves introducing
new ideas throughout a company's rank and file without
disrupting day-to-day operations.
   Mr. Lessin and his staff help companies explain such
things as why a new product or practice is really important,
why everyone should support it -- and why the people
associated with the old product or practice weren't
necessarily dolts.
   Mr. Lessin says he benefits from his own experience in
developing new products and ideas for a number of major
companies as well as his own high-tech startup. In 1983, Mr.
Lessin launched SmartCard International Inc. to help develop
and market the smart card, a card with a computer chip that
uses advanced data processing techniques. He took the company
public in 1986 but then left to start Lessin Technology Group
Inc. in New York.
   Working a narrow niche can be particularly tricky for
entrepreneurs selling a consumer product, such as Mr. Myers,
president of French Reflection Inc., Los Angeles. The mirror
importer, who is opening the Beverly Hills mirror boutique,
is gambling on a single high-priced product, France's Brot
mirror.
   Mr. Myers and his wife began importing these mirrors after
discovering them in a Paris hotel room in 1980. For those who
really care about their makeup, the mirrors offer optical
quality glass and -- for more money -- a built-in light. They
swivel, resist steaming up in the bathroom, avoid distortion
and come in dozens of varieties. Some magnify your features
or have goldplated frames. Selling mostly to interior
decorators and through direct mail, French Reflection says
sales have grown to more than $4 million annually.
   Mr. Myers says buyers have included a number of movie and
TV stars as well as several luxury hotels. The mirror "fits
in with the upscale European look the hotels want to
achieve," he explains.
   Of course, entrepreneurs in very narrow niches sometimes
think of diversification. But Mr. Myers has no intention of
moving away from the mirror niche he has carefully cultivated
over the past four years. It would be possible to sell other
bathroom products as well, but "that's not what I want to
do," says the mirror loyalist. "I believe too strongly in the
potential of these mirrors to try anything else."

   If President Bush is defeated in his confrontation with
Saddam Hussein, by now the essential test of his Presidency,
the battle will be lost not in the deserts of Arabia but in
the trading rooms of the world. Not by the Pentagon but by
the Treasury.
   It is enormously instructive that the naysayers and
putative war resisters are no longer talking much about body
bags, but instead are zeroing in on Mr. Bush's financial
Achilles' heel. Congressmen are flying off to have their
pictures taken with the troops, but are balking at forgiving
debts for Egypt or providing aid for Turkey. Anthony Lewis
invokes Professor Paul Kennedy and his decline of America
thesis, viewing the Persian Gulf defense effort as the last
gasp of a financially crippled giant.

<TEXT>
   This is the first international crisis in which the dollar
has fallen instead of rising, Kevin Phillips and Michael
Kinsley gloat. James Webb, a respected voice on the risks of
combat, cites the experience of Anthony Eden in the Suez
crisis. The United States refused to lend him financial
reserves to defend sterling, his military campaign was
stopped in its tracks, his career was ended and the sun set
on the British Empire.
   Now, none of this is inevitable and much of it is
nonsense. The Eisenhower-Dulles position on Suez was, along
with the coup against Ngo Dinh Diem in Vietnam, one of the
two great blunders of post-World War II foreign policy. The
rise in the U.S. tax burden has not been due to military
spending, but to welfare entitlements and special-interest
boondoggling. The answer to most of these complaints, and to
the spiraling price of oil, is to strike quickly, massively
and intelligently, and to win on the battlefield.
   Yet a general point rings true: Wars require a serious
financial policy, not to mention a strong currency. Yet the
dollar is falling, as Lawrence Kudlow elaborates nearby,
because the U.S. Treasury more or less wants it to (see
related editorial: "Treasury's Malign Neglect of the Dollar"
-- WSJ Sept. 26, 1990). This is no way to fight a war -- or
to run an economy. Even before Saddam invaded, the economic
expansion President Bush inherited from President Reagan was
gradually eroding away. In the second quarter, yesterday's
report confirmed, it crawled at an 0.4% annual rate.
   With the change in administrations, we have seen a policy
of optimism and growth gradually supplanted by a policy of
pessimism and austerity. Mr. Reagan was no economist, but he
wanted growth, and felt the general path was getting
government out of the way with tax cuts and deregulation. Mr.
Bush is evidently not interested in economists and their
abstruse quarrels, but has put his trust in Nick Brady's
loyalty and Dick Darman's brilliance. But with Secretary
Brady's "short-term" and Director Darman's "now-nowism," both
have enrolled as closet members of the American-decline set.
   Thus, predominance has tipped back to an economic model
harking to "malaise." The S&amp;Ls have sinned, so punish them
with heavy-handed regulation. Financial markets fluctuate, so
threaten them with stock-transfer taxes, and make the
Treasury's number-one priority getting hold of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.
   Above all America is trapped by debt and deficits, the
model runs. The only hope is a "deal" with Congress to reduce
the deficit, thereby lowering interest rates and sparking a
recovery. So go along. Make the focus of the negotiations
"the deficit" instead of the expenditure level, which really
would mean something. Give away the President's read-my-lips
pledge. Even though you don't believe them, take the revenue
projections of the Joint Tax Committee on the effects of a
capital-gains tax cut, and therefore the effects on income
distribution; but complain when Bob Dole draws the logical
outcome of playing with this stacked deck. Beat on the Fed
for easier money; a lower dollar will help the trade deficit,
and anyway is what we deserve.
   The lessons of the 1980s confounded this model and bared
its multiple fallacies. The U.S. has issued public debt
amounting to 50.9% of GNP, while Japan has issued public debt
for 63.8% of GNP. Britain has a budget surplus, but runs high
inflation and high interest rates. A depreciating currency
does not help a trade deficit and never has. Easy money does
not mean lower interest rates; since the Fed eased in the
summer, as Mr. Kudlow points out, Treasury bond yields have
risen to 9.16% from 8.42%. And it is feckless to believe
Congress could reach, in Fed Chairman Greenspan's phrase, a
"credible, long-term, enforceable" budget agreement.
   The financial-political recipe for a growth policy is
quite different: Tax cuts to revive incentives, in particular
a return to the historic policy of a lower rate on capital
gains, reflecting the effect of inflation and the limitations
on deductibility of capital losses. Reform of deposit
insurance as the centerpiece of S&amp;L (and banking) reform.
Replacing rhetoric about the deficit with an emphasis on
restraining expenditures. Keeping the no-new-taxes pledge as
the centerpiece of confrontation with Congress over budget
priorities. Monetary restraint, as Fed Governor Wayne Angell
urged yesterday, to guard against inflation. And ideally,
exchange-rate reform to preserve the dollar at purchasing
power parity with other currencies.
   Merely to list these policies shows how far public
discussion has drifted from the tone and the direction of the
Reagan years. If growth policies had been preserved and
extended these past 20 months, we believe the nation would be
on a much sounder footing to face the financial side of
defense deployments. Others will dispute this, of course, but
the policies in place put us on the brink of recession even
without the threat of war. And if we now enter a protracted
stalemate in the Gulf -- with a frantic oil market, a
faltering dollar and the administration pushing the Fed to
inflate -- George Bush will be threatened on the financial
front just as Anthony Eden was.
   Like his predecessor, Mr. Bush is no economist. But he is
a fighter pilot and an athlete. Surely this prepares him to
understand that you do not win wars by relying on generals
who believe in malaise.

   OLD GREENWICH, Conn. -- American Brands Inc. said it
declared a 2-for-1 stock split on its common shares and
increased its quarterly dividend on the post-split stock by
13%.
   The additional shares from the split will be distributed
Oct. 25 to stockholders of record Oct. 9, the company said.
After the split, about 197 million shares will be
outstanding. The lastest move represents American Brands'
third stock split in the last decade. The company split the
stock 2-for-1 in 1981 and 1986.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   American Brands also declared a dividend of 38.5 cents a
share on the post-split shares, payable Dec. 1 to holders of
record Nov. 8. The dividend is equal to 77 cents on each
share prior to the split, which is nine cents a share, or
about 13%, more than it has been paying.
   William J. Alley, chairman and chief executive officer,
said American Brands expects another "record year in 1990,"
and that the stock split and the dividend increase reflect
"the board's continued confidence in the prospects for the
company." He didn't elaborate beyond the statement.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
American Brands common shares closed at $68 a share, up $1.75
   In 1989, the company earned $630.8 million, or $6.51 a
share, up 20% from its previous year, on revenue of $11.92
billion. For the first six months of this year, American
Brands reported net income of $353.8 million, or $3.62 a
share, up 20%, on revenue of $6.16 billion, compared with
year-earlier net of $292.4 million, or $3.05 a share, on
revenue of $5.99 billion.
   The company makes cigarette brands such as Lucky Strike
and Carlton, liquors including Jim Beam whiskey, and Titleist
golf balls. It also provides life insurance through the
Franklin group of companies, operates the Wilson Jones office
products business, and recently acquired Moen Group Inc., a
faucet maker, from Forstmann, Little &amp; Co. for $975 million.

   USX Names
   T.C. Graham
   Vice Chairman

   PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp., creating a clear pattern of
succession in its top operations, named Thomas C. Graham to
the newly created position of vice chairman, steel and
diversified group.
   The 63-year-old Mr. Graham had been president of the
company's USS unit, overseeing the nation's largest steel
operations. Succeeding him in that post is Thomas J. Usher,
48, who had been executive vice president, heavy products.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The steel and energy concern also named Robert M.
Hernandez, 46, as senior vice president, finance and
treasurer. He succeeds William E. Lewellen, 65, who is
retiring. The moves take effect Monday.
   USX has a mandatory retirement age of 65, and
steel-industry observers had been speculating about Mr.
Graham's successor for more than a year. Most speculation
centered on Mr. Usher; Reuben L. Perin Jr., 52, executive
vice president, commercial, sheet and tin; and James T.
Bradford Jr., 63, executive vice president, operations, sheet
and tin. Mr. Usher has been credited by analysts with shoring
up the company's difficult structural, plate and tubular
businesses.
   Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Usher began his career at
USX's steel business. Mr. Graham was recruited in 1983 from
LTV Corp.'s Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel unit to succeed William R.
Roesch, who was ill and died later that year. Mr. Graham, who
oversaw major shutdowns at the then-U.S. Steel during the
industry's toughest years, is largely credited with making it
one of the most profitable large steel makers in the nation.
Industry observers have speculated that Mr. Graham might be
interested in running USX's steel operations, should they be
spun off.
   With Mr. Graham's retirement from USX in sight, "it's
pretty clear that people have begun to focus more on the need
for orderly succession," said steel analyst Charles Bradford.
And the fact that Mr. Usher is a steel-operations executive
indicates the company wants to continue to "zero in on
operations," Mr. Bradford said.
   He also said the move puts Mr. Usher in place in time for
the coming negotiations with the United Steelworkers of
America, noting that Mr. Graham had been involved in shaping
previous labor pacts. USX's labor contract expires in
January.
   Mr. Usher will continue to report to Mr. Graham, who also
assumes the supervision of the company's diversified
business. Mr. Hernandez had been president of the U.S.
diversified group and had reported directly to Chairman
Charles A. Corry, 58. Mr. Hernandez, who will be responsible
for all corporate financings, domestic-project financings and
leasing activities, will now report to W. Bruce Thomas, 63,
vice chairman, administration, and chief financial officer.
   Charles C. Gedeon, 50, was named president of the U.S.
Diversified Group, replacing Mr. Hernandez, and senior vice
president, raw materials, of USS. Mr. Gedeon had been senior
vice president, related resources, for USS and USX.

   Chicago's Big Exchanges Duel
   As They Attempt to Cut a Deal

   CHICAGO -- Bitter rivalry between the two big futures
exchanges here will work against the latest attempts to
develop joint operations.
   The Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange
are embracing a plan to cut costs and work together to boost
their international businesses. The exchanges said last week
that they are exploring sharing trading floors and
trade-processing facilities -- ventures that eventually could
lead to complete union.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, the exchanges are locked in a costly
marketing duel with competing new products designed to tap
investor interest in the Japanese stock and bond markets. The
Merc kicked off the new product battle yesterday with new
futures and options contracts based on the widely quoted
Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks. The Board of Trade
weighs in tomorrow with futures contracts based on a broader
index of Japanese stocks and Japanese government bonds.
   "It makes so much sense for us to get together, but here
we are fighting it out again," says Patrick Arbor, a Board of
Trade director.
   The Board of Trade, desperately needing to enlarge the
area for its Treasury bond and other financial futures,
initiated the latest peace talks between the exchanges. The
financial trading room at the exchange is antiquated by
modern trading standards, and Board of Trade chairman William
O'Connor estimates an up-to-date one may cost $100 million.
   The Merc has a different space problem: It has too much.
An entire trading floor sits empty one level above the Merc's
existing trading quarters. In rosier times the exchange had
planned to move all of its stock-index related products to
the new floor. But trading volume in stock-index futures
never recovered from the 1987 stock market crash.
   Mr. O'Connor favors the use of the Merc's empty floor to
trade T-bond futures, among other contracts.
   Futures brokerage and trading firms that use both
exchanges are increasingly urging them to work together and
lower the cost of futures trading. Most of the Merc's member
firms also belong to the Board of Trade, paying clearing and
other fees at both exchanges that could be sharply reduced if
the two combined certain functions.
   Cost control is playing an increasing role in exchange
affairs. This year the Board of Trade, rather than spending
millions in development costs, agreed to combine its planned
electronic trading system into the Merc's Globex computerized
trading system. The exchanges also are sharing the cost of
developing a hand-held terminal to be used by brokers in the
futures pits.
   But exchange politics, as much as dollars and common
sense, are motivating the latest peace talks at the
exchanges, say Board of Trade and Merc members. Mr. O'Connor
and Mr. Arbor are expected to vie for Board of Trade chairman
in December. Mr. Arbor, a former exchange vice chairman, has
made no secret of his plans to advocate an outright merger of
the two markets. Mr. O'Connor's supporters urged him to
advocate talks with the Merc to counter the impact of similar
proposals from Mr. Arbor, members of both exchanges say.
   Mr. O'Connor is vacationing in Ireland and couldn't be
reached for comment. Mr. Arbor said he hasn't made a final
decision on whether to run for chairman, but he said that Mr.
O'Connor's overtures to the Merc don't go far enough.
   Institutional pride may work to keep the exchanges apart.
The independent traders on the Board of Trade floor don't
want to appear to be losers in any deal, forced to walk
several blocks to trade on the Merc's floor. Merc traders
aren't above putting appearances first, either. A decade ago,
when both exchanges were in need of additional space and
having similar talks, Merc traders reportedly rejected a
Board of Trade suggestion that they build a facility just
south of that exchange's building. They didn't want to be
seen as trading "behind" the Board of Trade, members of both
exchanges say.
   For such reasons, many traders think any formal links of
the Merc and the Board of Trade are years away, despite the
recent warming. "We won't see a merger in my lifetime,"
predicts the chief executive officer of a Merc member firm,
who is in his 40s.
   With its new contract, the Merc aims to attract U.S.
hedgers and speculators, and to ease trade processing, by
having the contract settle in dollars rather than Japanese
yen. As a result, there is essentially no risk that
short-term currency price swings will affect the value of the
futures contract.
   A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a
specific amount of a commodity or financial instrument at an
agreed-to price by a certain date.
   Tomorrow night, the Board of Trade starts trading its
futures and options contracts on the Topix index of about
1,200 Japanese stocks. The exchange will launch the new
contract during its 7 p.m. to 9:15 p.m. CDT evening session,
which coincides with the morning trading session on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. After the evening launch, the contract will
also trade during the exchange's regular hours for
stock-index products, 8:15 a.m. to 3:15 p.m. CDT.
   The broader Topix index is aimed particularly at
institutional investors who want to hedge against potential
losses on their Japanese stock holdings. It is settled in
yen, not dollars.
   Many Chicago traders predict that the Merc's Nikkei
contract, rather than the Board of Trade's Topix index, will
generate the most interest from local independent traders who
operate on exchange floors here. The volume of trading these
"locals" can handle should attract hedging orders from big
institutional traders in the U.S. and Tokyo, these traders
predict.
   "To attract the Japanese, we've got to make sure that
there are warm bodies in the pit," says Matthew Moran,
director of the Merc's equity-index product marketing
department. "If there are, the institutional investors will
come, too." In its first day of trading, the Nikkei volume
totaled 915 futures contracts and 532 options.
   However, while the Merc enjoys greater name recognition
for its Japanese stock-index product, the Board of Trade's
offering of a night trading session for its Topix future may
give it an edge, some believe.
   "Certainly Tokyo's participants will look favorably on
arbitrage opportunities created by night trading," which
would overlap trading hours of Japanese stocks, says Nobuaki
Ohmura, executive vice president of fixed-income investments
for Daiwa America Inc., the U.S. unit of one of Japan's four
biggest securities firms.
   The Topix debut may be overshadowed by the Board of
Trade's introduction tomorrow night of futures and options on
Japanese government bonds. The exchange hopes trading in
these contracts will benefit from its huge success in trading
U.S. Treasury bond futures and options. The Board of Trade's
T-bond futures contract is the most actively traded futures
contract in the country.
   Arbitrage opportunities during the night trading session
also are likely to give trading in Japanese government bonds
a boost, says Joseph Cole, research director for Indosuez
Carr Futures Inc. in Chicago.
   Despite the money and time spent on them, success isn't
guaranteed for any of the new contracts. Their long-term
success hinges largely on the participation of Japan's huge
financial institutions, and they traditionally move slowly to
new products. They may also hold back because of the poor
performance of many Japanese brokerage firms' Wall Street
units in the 1980s.
   Further, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and skyrocketing
crude-oil prices are likely to put on hold expansion plans at
many Japanese institutions. Falling stock prices in Japan,
coupled with rising interest rates there, could also reduce
the desire of Japanese investors to make substantial
commitments to foreign markets for the foreseeable future.
   Looking ahead, the Japanese are likely to be concerned
about protecting their own futures markets, which are recent
outgrowths of the still-evolving easing of that country's
capital markets. For example, an affiliate of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange has been trading Japanese government bond futures
for five years. Stock-index futures contracts are also
actively traded on exchanges in Tokyo and Osaka.
   While the Chicago exchanges whittle away at each other as
they compete for business to support the new contracts,
Japanese finance officials may encourage institutions to keep
their money at home to promote domestic markets.

   PARIS -- Carlo De Benedetti's French holding company,
Cerus S.A., agreed to shed about a third of its 14.4% stake
in Societe Generale de Belgique S.A.
   The move, in which 4.8% of the company will be sold, will
leave Cerus with less than 10% of Generale's shares, a
reminder of its failed 1988 takeover bid for the Belgian
holding company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cerus will exchange the shares for stock in Cie.
Financiere de Suez, the French banking group that came to
Generale's rescue against Mr. De Benedetti, an Italian
financier, two years ago. Cerus also will acquire small
stakes in some Suez allies as part of the exchange, Paris
financial sources said.
   Mr. De Benedetti won't take a cash loss, even though the
shares are down almost 40% from what he paid. Yesterday, on
the Brussels Bourse, Generale shares fell 50 Belgian francs
($1.56) to 2,125 francs ($66.40). In 1988, Cerus paid an
average of 3,500 francs a share.
   Detailed terms of the swap weren't available. But at
current share prices, a 5% stake in Generale is valued at
about 6.8 billion francs.
   Today's agreement will leave Mr. De Benedetti holding
Generale paper which he will still want to sell, analysts
said.
   Before the transaction, Cerus had slightly under 3% in
Suez, while Suez had about 4% in Cerus and a further 10% in
Mr. De Benedetti's Italian parent company, Cofide.
   Cerus will stop consolidating Generale's earnings in its
group accounts and will cause an earnings drop.
   Last year, Generale accounted for almost one-third of
Cerus's 1.24 billion French franc ($238 million) net profit.

   MADISON, N.J. -- Schering-Plough Corp., sitting on a cash
hoard and hoping to snatch up its shares cheaply, said it
would spend up to $1 billion to buy back its stock.
   The announcement sent Schering-Plough shares up $3.25, to
$44, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Based on that price, the company would be able to buy back
about 10% of its 226.9 million shares outstanding.

   Since the steady decline of stock market prices in the
aftermath of the Middle East crisis, a number of companies
have started or extended stock repurchase programs.
   Robert P. Luciano, chairman and chief executive officer of
Schering-Plough, said that while the company continues to
seek acquisitions and business partnerships, "we are
undertaking this share repurchase program because current
market conditions have made the stock an exceptionally good
value."
   Indeed, Schering-Plough was trading at about $49 a share
before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but has steadily
declined since, reaching its low of $40.75 a share on Monday.
   The company said it expects to purchase the shares in the
open market from time to time, depending on market
conditions. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. will act as exclusive broker

about $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments -- joins other cash-rich pharmaceutical concerns
in enhancing the market value of their stocks. In 1987, Merck
&amp; Co. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. initiated $1 billion buy-back
programs.
   "A lot of health companies have done this," said Kent
Blair, analyst with Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette. "But some
companies never followed through. They felt the stock was
cheap but when it went up the buy-backs were canceled."

   DALLAS -- Trammell Crow Co. should thank Donald Trump.
   With all the attention focused on the flashy New Yorker's
recent financial troubles, the Crow company has been able to
duck the limelight while it restructures and refinances its
wounded real estate empire. "The Crow deals will make Donald
Trump's look like a walk in the woods," says a former Crow
partner, referring to the size of the company and the
complexity of the restructuring.

   The Crow retrenchment has occupied some of the country's
biggest lenders for almost 18 months as the recession in
commercial real estate has spread beyond the company's home
base of Texas to a great many markets in the U.S.
   Meanwhile, as the company's massive development machine
has slowed to a crawl, Crow has staked its future on property
sales and management of other people's properties,
historically second- and third-string lines of business.
   Through all this, Crow's management and front-line
partners are stoic and, occasionally, even enthusiastic about
the changes the company is confronting. Loan workouts, for
instance, aren't the most pleasant of business activities,
but Crow takes pride in the orderliness of negotiations with
its lenders, in contrast to the panicky, 11th-hour efforts
that have characterized some other developers' refinancings.
   As for the shift away from speculative development, the
party line, as reiterated by managing partner Joel Peterson,
is this: "We want to be a full-service real estate company."
   The change of life isn't unique, of course. Other big
national developers and their lenders have had to switch
gears as rents and property values have declined and capital
sources have all but dried up. Crow has seen its top
Texas-based competitors, Lincoln Property Co. and Vantage
Co., slide from national prominence while paring staffs and
operations to a fraction of what they were in the early
1980s.
   But Trammell Crow's fortunes or misfortunes are more
closely watched than those of most developers. It survived
the Texas real estate massacre because it's huge and diverse,
so its problems now show how bad things have gotten
nationwide.
   The company's 170 partners hold $10.5 billion in assets
spread through a nationwide maze of more than 3,000
independent partnerships. Those partnerships have been
responsible for the development of about 8,000 individual
projects, from office towers to warehouses.
   It's no wonder that Crow's woes affect lenders and real
estate markets across the nation. In mid-March, the company
and its lenders got an inkling of what a Crow collapse would
mean as rumors spread that the developer was about to default
on billions of dollars in loans.
   In a twinkling, the stocks of Crow lenders nose-dived.
NCNB Corp., frightened by the heavy trading in its stock,
took the unusual step of revealing to securities analysts the
amount of its loans to Trammell Crow ($56 million at the
time) to prove its exposure was limited. Suddenly, people
started to think the unthinkable: Could Crow collapse?
   The rumors about massive defaults proved unfounded and,
thanks to its complex partnership structure and sheer size,
collapse isn't likely. But aftershocks from that episode
still reverberate through the company.
   With 15% to 20% of its 8,000 projects in financial
trouble, according to a person familiar with the company's
operations, Crow lenders, both domestic and foreign, have
been pressing questions about the viability of the company.
Shaken by the experience, the usually-secretive Crow
organization is discussing its problems more openly and has
retained, for the first time, an outside public relations
counsel to get its story out.
   At one time, it was a grand story. Trammell Crow, a Dallas
native and accountant, founded the company 42 years ago on
the belief that he could create a national powerhouse in what
had traditionally been a regional business.
   From his first warehouse development in Dallas's Trinity
River bottoms, Mr. Crow's vision of real estate grew to
include huge trade markets for the apparel, furniture and
computer industries, posh high-rise office towers,
first-class hotels, homes, apartments and retail
developments. (The trade markets and hotels are parts of a
separate business run by the Crow family. Trammell Crow
Residential, comprising the home and apartment interests, is
a distinct entity headquartered in Atlanta.)
   To build this far-flung empire, Mr. Crow lured waves of
aggressive young Turks from the most prestigious business
schools, and gave them the same perks he and all other Crow
partners enjoyed: an $18,000 base salary and a spartan
cubicle. But, filled with promises of autonomy and equity in
the projects they created, they became to the development
world what investment bankers were to Wall Street during the
takeover craze -- cocky gunslingers eager to make big deals.
   And, oh, did they make deals. For more than a decade,
starting in the late 1970s, Crow led all commercial
developers in the dollar value of annual new construction,
according to a survey by Building Design &amp; Construction
magazine. The company colors -- two shades of blue -- could
be found in every major city in the country.
   Crow employees saw themselves as an elite, the proteges of
the master builder. They took pride in the company's unusual
culture, with its egalitarian management structure and the
low base salaries intended to motivate creative development.
   Now, top Crow officials say the compensation structure
worked too well. "Not only was it a little low," says
managing partner Peterson, "it encouraged only one kind of
activity." That was development.
   "You had to keep developing," says one young ex-partner.
"It forced new partners to make some incorrect business
decisions."
   Particularly in the Southwest, Crow's gung-ho developers
-- and a host of others -- didn't know when to stop building.
When oil prices nose-dived in the mid-1980s, followed by the
1986 tax reform that wiped out most tax breaks for real
estate investments, the overbuilt Houston market tanked.
   Partners there quickly ran through the division's cash
reserves; eventually, Crow's 10 top partners were forced to
bail out the Houston group, dipping into their own pools of
profit.
   As more and more Southwestern reserve pools were depleted,
Crow's top managers were confronted with a tough choice: Raid
reserves in other geographical divisions or force property
sales in healthy markets. Selling properties was anathema to
a company that, with few exceptions, still adhered to Mr.
Crow's philosophy: "The one who sells is wrong."
   And when the reserve pools were first established in 1978,
partners had been promised that one division's funds wouldn't
be tapped for losses in another. With minimum reserve levels
rising steadily to cover mounting losses, partners' profits
were already dwindling. A raid on other divisions' reserves
could have spawned a mutiny.
   A mutiny was brewing anyway, as Crow's spooked senior
partners decided to centralize decision-making, hoping that
would prevent overbuilding from spreading beyond the
Southwest. That prompted an exodus of dozens of key regional
partners, who saw the plan as a short-sighted overreaction to
what was then a Texas problem. Among them were rising stars
such as Allen Hamilton in Chicago, Don Childress in Atlanta
and Ned Spieker in California, each of whom now heads his own
real estate company.
   But many partners, particularly the younger ones, found
themselves trapped. To finance development of their projects,
they'd borrowed from other Crow partners and the reserve
pools via a kind of internal chit system. As the projects'
health worsened, the partners dipped deeper into the
reserves.
   Young partners were unable to leave without paying off the
balance of their debts to the reserve pools or having the
debts forgiven, an alternative that carried the threat of a
massive tax hit in addition to saddling remaining partners
with more debt.
   "It was the Hotel California syndrome," says one former
partner, citing the lyrics of the rock song: "You can check
out any time you like, but you can never leave."
   By the time Crow applied the development brakes, however,
the damage from overbuilding had been done. In Minneapolis,
for example, Crow built the first Class-A office tower in the
city's southwestern suburbs. But the company, and other
developers, continued building; now, about 25% of suburban
Minneapolis office space is empty.
   As a result, Crow has defaulted on about $150 million in
loans for its Minneapolis projects from Teachers Insurance &amp;
Annuity Association of America. To clear up those loans, Crow
is handing Teachers the keys to two of its Minneapolis office
buildings and selling the lender a third.
   The negotiations with Teachers follow by just a few months
the completion of Crow's most ambitious refinancing effort to
date -- a $456 million deal with Equitable Real Estate
Investment Management Inc., a unit of Equitable Life
Assurance Society and a Crow lender since the 1950s.
   Equitable played an important role in the company's
largest previous refinancing effort, back in 1977. Then, in a
now-legendary showdown with lenders, Mr. Crow offered the
lenders an unappealing choice: Accept loan terms dictated by
him or walk away with the keys and the deeds to the
properties they financed and manage the vast portfolio
themselves.
   The lenders acquiesced, winning only a concession that Mr.
Crow, then 63 years old, relinquish control of the company to
J. McDonald (Don) Williams, a lawyer handling loan workouts
for the company. Eight years later, chief financial officer
Mr. Peterson was also named a managing partner. Mr. Crow
continues to manage his own investments, and maintains a busy
work schedule, but is no longer involved in day-to-day
management.
   For this round of loan workouts, Crow was seeking $600
million to cure its biggest headache: the company's decimated
Southwest properties.
   By early 1989, when the talks began, Crow's Southwest
region had bottomed out with a negative cash flow of $48.5
million. Much of the damage had been done by the collapse of
Dallas's two largest bank holding companies, emptying much of
the three million square feet of office space in three
high-rise towers built by Crow in downtown Dallas between
1982 and 1986. "Enough space came back on the market to fill
two high-rises," says Crow partner Barry Henry. "It was the
single most critical thing that affected downtown Dallas."
   The Equitable money was earmarked to pay off loans from
about 30 Southwest lenders and bring other loans current.
While the talks were under way, Crow's 10 senior partners
ponied up even more of their own profits to keep the loans on
the Southwest properties current. In 1989 alone, according to
Mr. Williams, the 10 senior partners kicked in $57 million,
for a total of $200 million since late 1985.
   By the time the Equitable deal was sealed this spring, the
size of the refinancing had been scaled back to $456 million,
reflecting the sales of some properties and improved
conditions at others. The bulk of the cash was used to pay
off loans on about 90 properties, which were then pledged as
collateral for the new debt. About $90 million was used to
pay down debt on another 60 Crow properties.
   In mid-April, the company's 10 senior partners voted to
forgive about $175 million in internal debt racked up by
about 30 junior partners in the Southwest. As many as 25 more
partners will be offered the bailout this year. In return,
the young partners are giving up their cherished equity in
the projects they developed.
   Now, remaining partners' earnings are no longer tied to
the profitability of their projects: most are drawing
market-rate salaries. "We don't want them to have the
incentive to go out and build," says Mr. Williams.
   Finding new incentives is going to be tough. Some former
developers are being asked to manage properties for fees, an
activity with far less profit potential than building them
for a piece of the action.
   Others are being asked to channel their natural
competitiveness into landing build-to-suit projects on behalf
of single tenants; still others are scouting real estate
acquisitions for the Crow company's joint-venture partners.
Crow's top executives insist they've been in these businesses
all along and are simply shifting emphasis to meet customer
needs.
   Crow is doing that by tapping some of its most
enthusiastic young partners to lead new divisions in the
company, including once-unheard-of departments such as land
sales and corporate services, through which Crow is
contracting to take over some or all of the duties of
national companies' in-house real estate departments. The
first contracts in the pipeline are with Deerfield,
Ill.-based Baxter International Inc. and McKesson Corp., San
Francisco.
   Not everyone is sticking around. Leasing agents and more
senior marketing principals have departed, and headhunters
specializing in real estate placements report receiving
record numbers of Trammell Crow resumes during the past nine
months -- including those of partners.
   Others didn't leave voluntarily. During the past 18
months, the company has closed or consolidated 28 of its 90
offices and cut 8% to 10% of its 3,300 employees.
   The company is counting on property management to generate
as much as half of its fee income, which last year totaled
almost $140 million. But that field is crowded with long-time
property-management firms competing against newcomers,
including former developers like Crow, displaced thrift
executives and even lenders.
   There's an unmistakable sense of loss as Crow's top
officials discuss the changes, and their impact on Crow
partners. "It's not the same world they signed up for, but
it's the world we've got," Mr. Williams says. "There's been a
sea change in our business. This is not a get-rich-quick
industry any more. That's over. I'm sorry. I wish there were
a lot of development opportunities. This is now a
professional, nickel-and-dime, grind-it-out, customer-service
business."

   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon said the Soviet Union cut
overall defense spending last year by 4% to 5% and slashed
production of tanks, ammunition, helicopters and other
weapons.
   Nevertheless, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in releasing
the department's annual review of the Soviet military, warned
that the Soviet Union remains a military threat that must be
countered.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ninth edition of Soviet Military Power reported a cut
of between 6% and 7% in weapons procurement spending, a
halving of tank production to 1,700 from 3,500, and lesser
cuts in the output of fighter planes, bombers, artillery and
other important weapons. It also disclosed a "dramatic
decrease" in Soviet space launches and predicted that Moscow
will scrap as many as 450 navy ships by 1996 and cut 80,000
sailors from its navy.
   The slick book still features photos of menacing Red Army
weapons, just as it has since it was first issued by the
Reagan administration to gather public support for the
military buildup of the 1980s.
   But this year, the book also included photos of Soviet
troops leaving Eastern Europe, Soviet missiles being
destroyed to comply with arms-control treaties, and Soviet
bombers whose tails had been cut off to make them unusable.
   The report, however, repeatedly noted that in some weapons
categories, especially strategic nuclear weapons, Moscow is
continuing to build strength and that even reduced output
levels for items such as tanks still top Western production
rates. It also stressed that the Soviets still field the
world's largest military force.
   "What it does not reveal, no matter how much we might wish
it," said Mr. Cheney, "is an eviscerated Soviet force
structure and an evaporating threat . . . The Soviet Union
remains an enormous military superpower."

   BUSINESSES PROTEST plans to deny deductions for interest
on their tax debts.
   The 1986 tax act eliminated personal deductions of
interest on tax underpayments. On Sept. 6, Rep. Stark (D.,
Calif.), calling for equal treatment, entered a bill to deny
such deductions to corporations. To businesses' dismay, his
proposal has popped up among items tentatively accepted by
both Democrat and Republican budget negotiators, who say it
may raise $4.5 billion over five years. So major trade groups
-- including manufacturers, bankers and doctors -- are
mounting an attack on the plan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Interest is an ordinary and necessary business expense,
they say, and often stems from protracted good-faith disputes
over complex law. The corporate Tax Executives Institute
calls the proposal "gimmickry" meant to force corporations to
rush to pay interest before it takes effect in 1991. Andre
Fogarasi of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., CPAs, says the proposal
would disrupt audits and the newly revised penalty system.
   For individuals and corporations, interest paid on overdue
tax refunds would remain taxable under the proposal.
                                                                                                       

   HE LOST FAITH in conversion after this foreign-exchange
loss.
   A U.S. citizen we'll call Cosmo bought a place abroad in
1986 for local currency -- let's say 95,000 clams, equal then
to $95,000. He financed it with an 85,000-clam mortgage and
made it his home. Cosmo sold his home in 1989 for 142,000
clams and used 85,000 to pay off the mortgage, leaving a gain
taxable on his U.S. return. On that return, he must convert
clams into dollars at the rates in effect at the time of the
transactions. Trouble is, the dollar fell 5% against the clam
between 1986 and 1989.
   In clams, Cosmo did all right. But in dollars -- just on
his return -- he paid $4,474 more to retire the loan than he
borrowed, so he has an exchange loss. Naturally, he wants to
deduct the loss from his sale gain. But IRS Revenue Ruling
90-79 says he can't: A mortgage transaction is treated
separately from a home purchase and sale. Tax law limits
personal-loss deductions to those from a business, an
income-producing activity, or a casualty. Losses on home
mortgages don't qualify. (A gain on selling a home is
taxable; a loss isn't deductible.)
                                                                                                       

   OLD IRONSIDES the boat isn't, but the IRS can't sell it as
perishable goods.
   On June 1, the IRS seized a $72,500 cutter from Gerald A.
Galusha, a confessed marijuana grower, fearing he would try
to evade an alleged $223,000 in back taxes. The IRS put the
47-foot, 24-year-old sailboat in dry dock in Seattle and
planned its sale on Aug. 1 if Galusha didn't post a $72,500
bond. But he turned to the Tax Court: While a case is pending
there, the IRS may sell seized assets only on certain
conditions. One is that the property is perishable. The IRS
claimed it could meet the terms.
   The IRS said the wood hull would deteriorate rapidly in
dry dock or even in the water without extensive maintenance.
It also argued that maintenance costs would reduce sale
proceeds and that the boat's value would drop if a sale were
delayed. Now Judge Gerber has granted Galusha's plea to stay
a sale pending the outcome of the tax case. "Perishable"
means rapid decay, the judge said, yet proper care in the
water should preserve the boat for years.
   Also, the IRS failed to show the boat was losing value or
that maintenance would be too costly, the judge added.
                                                                                                       

   AFFORDABLE-HOUSING aid for the poor in metropolitan areas
now qualifies for Missouri state-income-tax credits of as
much as 55% of eligible expenses. Total annual credits are
limited to $2 million in the first year, but the ceiling
rises eventually to $10 million.
                                                                                                       

   INCOME-TAX TREATIES with West Germany, Spain, Finland,
Tunisia, India, and Indonesia were ratified by the Senate. It
also agreed to a treaty to share tax data with certain
nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.
                                                                                                       

   A NEW ESTATE-TAX RETURN, Form 706, has been delayed again
at least until mid-October. Due first in August and then this
month, it will replace the 1988 version and reflects several
changes in the law.
                                                                                                       

   A GETTY SON finds a way without a will to get $10 million
tax-free.
   J. Ronald Getty, eldest son of J. Paul Getty, felt
short-changed when the billionaire left most of his wealth to
the Getty Museum in 1976. Ronald Getty sued the museum,
claiming his father reneged on a promised bequest, and
settled for $10 million in 1980. To him, the cash was in lieu
of a bequest; he didn't report it on his return. But to the
IRS, it was ordinary income, taxable in 1980 at the 70% top
rate; and in 1988, the Tax Court agreed the money replaced
lost income, not inherited property.
   Ronald Getty appealed. Now the ninth-circuit appeals court
has upheld his stand. While the Tax Court saw ambiguity in
the facts, appellate Judge Thompson says a preponderance of
the evidence shows that Getty sued the museum to reclaim a
lost bequest. Thus, the settlement payment should be treated
as tax-free property, not income.
   The Tax Court's 1988 ruling noted that Getty had spent $2
million in legal fees in suing the museum.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: The non-profit NCAA isn't taxable on advertising
income from basketball-tourney programs, the 10th-circuit
appeals court says, reversing the Tax Court. . . . Fighting
intensified audits of small pension plans, the American
Society of Pension Actuaries wins a court order directing the
IRS to disclose documents on which a $666 million tax-revenue
estimate was based.

   U.S.-Built Car, Truck Sales Fall 5.7%
   In Good Showing From Strong '89 Level

   DETROIT -- Sales of domestically built cars and trucks
fell 5.7% in mid-September from a strong year-ago period. The
drop was surprisingly small given the soaring gasoline prices
and a slowing economy.
   Some of the strength in the market, analysts said, came
from buyers snapping up 1990-model cars before the
higher-priced 1991 models hit the showroom. "Even skittish
consumers are finding the model year close-out bargains too
good to pass up," said Thomas Webb, chief economist for the
National Automobile Dealers Association. The 1991 model year
begins Monday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for passenger
cars was a robust 7.8 million vehicles, compared with a hot
8.3 million annual rate a year ago and a 7.1 million rate in
early September.
   Overall, the 10 domestic car makers sold 322,216 vehicles
in the second 10 days of September, down 5.7% from the 1989
period. Domestic truck sales fell 10.6%, but domestic car
sales were much stronger, declining only 2.6%.
   The drop in truck sales, which in recent years have been
more robust than car sales, indicates that some consumers are
nervous about rising gasoline prices. But some models of
large cars continue to sell well, showing that there hasn't
yet been a wholesale shift toward smaller, fuel-efficient
cars.
   "You still get some people who don't care about the
mileage," said Roy Watson, sales manager of Forest Lake
Chrysler and Forest Lake Ford in Minnesota. "They just drive
what they want to drive."
   The Japanese auto makers continued to post strong gains in
sales of vehicles produced in their U.S. assembly plants.
Nissan Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. each more than doubled
sales of domestically assembled vehicles from the year-ago
period.
   Not all Japanese auto makers fared as well. Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. sales of domestically produced cars fell 6.8%
from a year ago. Mitsubishi said it had a generous
dealer-incentive program running this time last year, and
that the company also is running short of its sporty Eclipse
models.
   But economic and political uncertainties also are taking
their toll, the company conceded. Showroom traffic is off 40%
from two months ago, said Richard S. Recchia, head of
Mitsubishi's U.S. sales arm. "A lot of people have deferred
the decision to buy until they see what will happen with the
economy and the Middle East," Mr. Recchia added.
   Ford Motor Co. put in the strongest performance of the
U.S. Big Three car makers. Ford's domestic car sales fell
7.3% while its domestic truck sales were down 7.9%.
   Ford's efforts to revive sales of its Escort subcompact
car appear to be working. Escort sales, which sagged earlier
in the year despite the introduction of a revamped model,
were up 11.2% from a year ago. Sales have been mounting ever
since Ford placed consumer incentives on the car in August.
   General Motors Corp. posted a 9.6% drop in total vehicles
sales, including a 16.3% drop in domestic truck sales.
Domestic car sales were down 6.4% while sales of GM's
imported cars, which included its fuel-efficient Geo line,
rose 10.4%.
   Chrysler Corp., hurting all year, continued to struggle in
mid-September. Domestic car sales dropped 12.1% from a year
ago, while domestic truck sales -- including Jeeps and
minivans -- declined 18.5%.

   ENVIROSOURCE Inc. (Stamford, Conn.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it lowered its ratings on long-term debt
and preferred stock of this environmental services company,
citing the company's weak operating performance. Moody's
dropped the ratings on the company's 14% extendible reset
notes due 1998, and its class G $7.25 cumulative convertible
preferred, to Caa from single-B-3. About $160 million of
long-term debt is affected.

   SUPERMARKETS GENERAL HOLDINGS Corp. (Woodbridge, N.J.) --
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered its ratings on about
$700 million of subordinated debt of the grocery store and
retailing concern to triple-C-plus from single-B-minus. S&amp;P
said the downgrade reflects "lower-than-anticipated sales and
subsequent weak cash generating ability." S&amp;P said the
company, which was taken private in a management buy-out in
1987, "continues to be highly leveraged, and interest expense
places a substantial call on cash flow."

   UJB FINANCIAL Corp.'s rating on its preferred stock was
cut to Ba-2 from Baa-3 and its commercial paper to not prime
from prime-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. The
credit-rating company's downgrading affects $250 million of
securities for the Princeton, N.J., holding parent of United
Jersey Bank. The rating action reflects "continuing
deterioration in the credit quality of UJB's real estate loan
portfolio, which will likely require substantially higher
levels of reserves, and lead to more significant
charge-offs," Moody's said.

   NEW YORK -- Short interest among over-the-counter stocks,
both large and small, rebounded in the month ended in
mid-September after easing in August.
   Short interest among larger OTC stocks gained 4.5%, while
short interest among smaller shares rose 6.5%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rouse Co., a Columbia, Md., real estate developer, led the
issues with the largest increase in short interest. On Aug.
24, President Michael Spear died in an airplane crash.
Mathias J. DeVito, chairman and chief executive officer,
assumed Mr. Spear's duties as president. Short interest in
Rouse rose more than 1.1 million shares to 3.3 million.
   Short interest in troubled Oracle Systems jumped 93.7% to
more than two million shares. Shares of the Redwood City,
Calif., software maker plummeted this summer amid signs that
its fast-paced growth had slowed. Oracle, which laid off 10%
of its work force last week, yesterday reported a loss for
the first quarter, ended Aug. 31, of 27 cents a share,
compared with net income of nine cents a share a year
earlier.
   Short interest jumped in three health care-related stocks:
SciMed Life Systems, St. Jude Medical and Healthcare
Services. Among technology companies, Software Toolworks and
Adobe Systems both turned up large increases in short
interest. Among financial institutions, Sunwest Financial
Services and BayBanks posted large boosts in short interest.
   First Executive, the Los Angeles life insurance company
that once held a large portfolio of junk bonds, continued to
hang on to its lead as the stock with the largest short
position with 8.5 million shares sold short.
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
   Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.
   And some short interest doesn't reflect any opinion on the
stock at all but shows up as part of another strategy, such
as arbitrage or dividend capture.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers Inc., the
self-regulatory agency that operates the Nasdaq computerized
system on which more than 4,300 OTC issues trade, compiles
short interest data in two categories: the approximately
two-thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks that trade
on the National Market System; and the other, generally
smaller stocks that don't.
   The NASD reported that short interest in 2,320 National
Market System securities as of mid-September totaled
266,883,329 shares, up from 255,404,934 shares among 2,319
NMS issues for August.
   Short interest in 1,217 other smaller issues totaled
39,176,536 shares for September, compared with 36,799,476
shares in 1,215 issues in August.
   The National Market System's short-interest ratio at
mid-September rose to 2.93 from 2.19 a month earlier, while
the short-interest ratio for other OTC issues climbed to 1.42
from 1.04 a month earlier.
   The ratio -- the number of trading days at the market's
average daily trading volume that would be required to
convert the total short interest position -- is a measure of
negative trader sentiment. Some analysts suggest, however,
that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because
options and other products can be used to hedge short
positions.

   CS First Boston
   Moves to Sell Pool
   Of `Bridge' Loans

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- CS First Boston Inc., in an effort to rid
itself of $1.1 billion in troubled "bridge" loans, is quietly
preparing to pool the bridges into a package and sell them.
   The high-yielding loans, which First Boston plans to
peddle in the private placement market, would be packaged in
securities much like a collateralized bond obligation, or
CBO. That's a package of a diversified group of high-risk
junk bonds that are pooled and separated by credit quality.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   First Boston's plan is Wall Street's latest effort at
grappling with the year-old collapse of the $200 billion
junk-bond market. The junk collapse left Wall Street firms
saddled with billions of dollars in temporary "bridge" loans
to corporate clients that couldn't be paid off. The bridges
were to have been paid when the clients sold junk bonds, but
that's been impossible with the paralysis in that market.
   Final details of First Boston's bridge-loan plan haven't
yet been worked out, according to people familiar with First
Boston. And the offering could be delayed if investors remain
skittish. But some of the loans are likely to be bought by CS
First Boston's parent, CS Holding, they said.
   The plan has apparently mollified credit-rating agencies,
which had been disappointed that First Boston has continued
to hold such a heavy bridge load. First Boston's $1.1 billion
bridge exposure is the greatest on Wall Street.
   Yesterday, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. affirmed its ratings of
CS First Boston's commercial paper, or short-term IOUs, and
about $147 million of subordinated debt, citing a "credible
plan to reduce these exposures."
   Archibald Cox Jr., newly named chief executive of the
firm's big First Boston Corp. securities unit, declined to
comment on the plan. He said only: "I believe the bridge
problem will be resolved before year end."
   People close to First Boston said its plan is expected to
include all its bridges except a $257 million loan to Campeau
Corp.'s Federated Department Stores Inc., which currently is
in bankrutpcy-law proceedings. The other bridges include a
$230 million loan to Ohio Mattress Co., $420 million to
American Medical International Inc. and about $200 million to
Jerrico Inc.
   CS First Boston is 44.5%-owned by CS Holding, the parent
of the big Swiss bank Credit Suisse. (Earlier this year,
First Boston sold about half the original $450 million Ohio
Mattress bridge to CS Holding, under pressure from rating
agencies.)
   Like most Wall Street firms, CS First Boston desperately
wants the bridges off its books. The firm was forced to take
more than $200 million in reserves last year for the bridge
loans, and this year is taking a similar amount under
pressure from credit-rating agencies.
   Before the recent plan, credit-rating agencies hadn't
ruled out a future downgrade of the debt of CS First Boston.
But yesterday, S&amp;P said it affirmed its ratings on the firm's
commercial paper at A1 and subordinated debt at
single-A-minus.
   In a statement, S&amp;P said that CS First Boston has "had to
contend with the dramatically reduced levels of activities in
the securities markets in general and a significant bridge
loan portfolio."
   S&amp;P believes, however, "that management is working on a
credible plan to reduce these exposures. In addition, the
close affiliation with CS Holding and related entities
combined with the overall strategic importance of CS First
Boston to CS Holding should provide adequate resources and
financial strength to maintain the current ratings."
   Edward Emmer, an S&amp;P managing director, said that the
rating agency "has an ongoing dialogue" with CS First Boston
and that "it seems from our discussions that they are
seriously addressing the problem of the bridges." He declined
to elaborate.
   CS First Boston has recently undergone a series of
management changes that have shaken morale at the firm; the
latest management shift occurred a week ago, when Curtis
Welling, head of First Boston's equity department, was
ousted.
   John M. Hennessy, CS First Boston chief executive, has
sought to calm the troops amid all the changes. "Assembling
the team is the most important part of any business plan," he
said in a recent internal memo. "In time, the results of
these leaders and our strategy will speak louder than any
words."
   Yesterday, First Boston Corp. named Charles H. Mayer as a
managing director and chief information officer, a new
postion. Mr. Mayer, a veteran of Salomon Inc. and Morgan
Stanley Group Inc., will report to Robert Raziano, First
Boston's head of finance, administration, operations and
systems.
   Today, the firm is expected to announce that it hired Paul
J. McAuliffe from Morgan Stanley to be a director in First
Boston's burgeoning real estate group, working for David M.
Malcolm, the firm's former junk-bond chief who earlier this
year was reassigned to head the real estate unit.

   WASHINGTON -- As oil prices soar, the Bush administration
is split over a proposal from the Energy Department to sell a
half million barrels a day from the nation's Strategic
Petroleum Reserve.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins offered the proposal at a
meeting of the president's National Security Council last
week, arguing it would help moderate increases in oil prices,
according to people at the meeting. Although there is
currently no shortage in the supply of oil, the Energy
Department plan would put a million more barrels of oil a day
onto the market as soon as possible, with half coming from
U.S. reserves and the other half coming from Japanese and
German reserves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposal was supported by the State and Transportation
Departments. But Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady argued
strongly against it, according to sources at the meeting. And
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who was represented at
the meeting by his counselor, Wayne Berman, was also opposed.
   President Bush, who presided over the meeting but gave no
hint of his leanings, is expected to make a decision on the
plan as early as this week. If the president decides to back
the proposal, U.S. negotiators at Friday's meeting of the
International Energy Agency in Paris are likely to try to
reach an agreement with Japan, Germany and other
oil-consuming nations that hold reserves.
   Mr. Brady, the strongest opponent of the plan at the
security council meeting, argued that futures markets suggest
oil prices may be headed down, not up, the sources said. He
compared intervention in oil markets to his own experience as
Treasury secretary intervening in foreign-exchange markets,
saying that any such action must be well timed and well
thought out.
   The steep rise in oil prices this week has tended to
undercut Mr. Brady's arguments and put even more pressure on
the White House to back the Energy Department plan. There's
no indication that Messrs. Brady or Mosbacher have dropped
their opposition to the plan.
   Mr. Mosbacher's role in opposing the Energy Department
plan has raised some eyebrows both inside and outside the
administration. Mr. Mosbacher built a fortune in Texas oil
fields valued at an estimated $200 million, and still owns
huge interests in the family businesses, which own
oil-producing properties in Texas and Louisiana. Some critics
say a decision not to tap the reserves would keep oil prices
high and thus boost Mr. Mosbacher's personal wealth.
   "It's highly inappropriate" for Mr. Mosbacher to be
involved, said Edwin Rothschild, energy policy director at
Citizen Action, a Washington lobbying group on consumer and
labor issues. "The man stands to gain a lot of money from not
using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. There is certainly a
vested interest on the part of anyone who has crude oil --
and Mosbacher has a lot."
   Before the Persian Gulf crisis began, Mr. Mosbacher
recused himself from any consideration of energy issues. But
President Bush waived that recusal last month, saying he
needed Mr. Mosbacher's advice in the current crisis.
   Mr. Berman, counselor to the commerce secretary, said that
Mr. Mosbacher is simply providing advice to the president,
and not making decisions that affect the oil industry.
Moreover, Mr. Berman said, Mr. Mosbacher has "taken no
position on whether or not you draw down the strategic
petroleum reserve." Rather, he said, the commerce secretary
argued against the Energy Department proposal because the
president needs more time and information before making a
decision.

the year-ago period. Sales for the quarter ending Oct. 1 will
be about 8% below year-earlier levels, the company said.
   Henry G. Piper, president and chief executive officer,
said several of Brush Wellman's markets have been hurt by

   Canada's Mulroney, at Low Point in Popularity,
   May Have to Pack the Senate to Get Tax Passed

   OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada may be
the most unpopular leader in the Western world.
   His Gallup Poll approval rating of 19% is lower than
Richard Nixon's at the height of Watergate; below that of
Lyndon Johnson during the Vietnam War.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's one of the lowest, if not the lowest, of any Western
leader," says Bob Wybrow, a director of Gallup's British
affiliate.
   The prime minister's unpopularity may mean trouble for the
U.S.'s closest ally and biggest trading partner. Canada is on
the brink of a recession and in the midst of tax reform. Its
government debt is bigger, per capita, than in the U.S. The
country is searching for the way out of a constitutional
crisis that many Canadians fear will tear their country
apart.
   "He isn't in a position to lead that," says Dalton Camp,
who was a top political adviser to Mr. Mulroney until last
year. Mr. Camp says that in their present mood, Canadians
"wouldn't take him on as a baby sitter."
   Under Canada's parliamentary system, Mr. Mulroney can rule
for as many as three more years before he has to call an
election, because his party has a majority in the House of
Commons. But his loss of credibility already makes it harder
for him to govern.
   This week the prime minister may be forced to expand the
Canadian Senate, in order to rescue a 7% value-added tax
scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. The appointed Senate never
before has killed an important measure passed by the elected
House of Commons, but it has been emboldened by the
government's unpopularity. The Senate's banking committee
yesterday recommended against passing the the new tax.
   No Canadian prime minister has ever used his
constitutional power to pack the Senate, either, but Mr.
Mulroney can't govern effectively if it blocks crucial
legislation. Canadian retailers already have ordered millions
of catalogues with prices that will be incorrect if the new
tax isn't passed. Many have reprogrammed checkout counters or
ordered new cash registers in preparation for the new tax.
Some Canadian workers will lose unemployment benefits because
the Senate has tied up another government bill.
   "We almost have a coup here," said Harvie Andre, the House
of Commons leader for Mr. Mulroney's Progressive Conservative
Party.
   Unrest has spread beyond the Senate. Eight members of the
House of Commons, including a cabinet minister, have left Mr.
Mulroney's party this year. Until Parliament reopened Monday,
Mr. Mulroney had been lying so low that many Canadians
thought his troubles had made him sick.
   Many Canadians just don't like Mr. Mulroney as a person.
They call him `Lyin' Brian' because a gift for off-the-cuff
hyperbole makes him seem insincere. He tried to reform
Canada's lavish welfare benefits after declaring that they
were "a sacred trust." He negotiated a free-trade agreement
with the U.S. after saying that free trade "affects Canadian
sovereignty and we will have none of it."
   But Mr. Mulroney's problems stem mostly from politically
risky efforts to solve Canada's most pressing problems.
   "He had the most ambitious agenda of any prime minister I
know of. He may pretty well have worn the people out," says
Mr. Camp.
   The issues of trade with the U.S. and relations between
French and English Canadians have dominated Canadian politics
since the country was formed in 1867. Canadian nationalists
always opposed closer ties with the U.S. and they still do.
Mr. Mulroney took a huge gamble when he signed the trade pact
with the U.S. in 1988. He took another when he persuaded the
premiers of all 10 Canadian provinces to approve
constitutional amendments that met French-speaking Quebec's
demand to be recognized as a "distinct society."
   The benefits of free trade have been swamped by other
economic factors. The Canadian dollar has risen about 12%
against the U.S. dollar since the pact, more than wiping out
the competitive gains from U.S. tariff reductions.
   The "distinct society" plan proved unpopular with
English-speaking Canadians. It collapsed this summer in a
bitter national debate that left French and English more
antagonistic than before. Now Quebec is making tougher
demands and the Western provinces want to rewrite the
constitution to give themselves more power. And this summer,
Indians blocked roads, bridges and railroads to demand
special constitutional status.
   Canadians see Mr. Mulroney's constitutional initiative as
a "total failure" says Donna Dasko, vice president of
Environics Research Group Inc., a polling concern. "The
country is blaming the politicians for getting us into this
and coming out with a fractured country," she adds.
   The prime minister raised more hackles by trying to check
a generation-long government borrowing spree. He raised taxes
and cut programs. Government revenues have risen 60% since
Mr. Mulroney took office. Spending, aside from interest on
government debt, has gone up only 20%.
   This belt-tightening meant a chorus of complaints over
shrinking subsidies for everything from women's crisis
centers to unprofitable railroad lines. "You can't introduce
{the value added tax}, reform unemployment insurance, shut
down the trains and do all those things without incurring the
wrath of the people," concedes Bill Fox, a longtime friend of
the prime minister and his former press secretary.
   The 7% value-added tax on almost all goods and services,
except food, is a crucial part of Mr. Mulroney's fiscal
revision. It's meant to replace a 13.5% tax on manufacturers,
which economists say skews investment away from manufacturing
and favors imports over Canadian goods.
   But consumers see it as a new burden. Provincial
governments hate it because sales taxes previously were a
provincial monopoly. A recent Environics poll found 76% of
Canadians opposed to the tax, including 54% of Conservative
voters.
   Canadians' dislike for Mr. Mulroney hasn't made them any
fonder of other national leaders. The three-year-old Reform
Party, which wants more power for the Western provinces, now
leads the public opinion polls in Alberta, a traditional
Conservative stronghold. A separatist candidate for the
national Parliament won 68% of the vote in the only Quebec
by-election held since this summer's "distinct society"
debacle. Voters in Ontario earlier this month elected the
socialist New Democratic Party to a majority of seats in
their provincial parliament.
   The prime minister still has a core of support, especially
among business executives who welcome his free-trade and
deficit-fighting policies.
   And Mr. Mulroney says he can recover. "I've been through
this before," he told reporters earlier this week: "I started
the '84 election campaign way behind. I started the '88
election campaign way behind. This is pretty well where we've
been before we climbed slowly and surely back to win another
majority government."

   Grown Kids at Home?
   Most Parents Don't Mind
                                                                                                       

</LP>
<TEXT>
   MOST PARENTS are happy to have adult children living with
them -- but there are important exceptions.
   William Aquilino and Khalil Supple of the University of
Wisconsin's Center for Demography investigated relationships
in a representative sample of over 600 families where parents
had "co-resident" young adult children, ones between ages 19
and 34. They asked the parents about the frequency of
disagreements and quarrels, whether there was much shouting
and bad blood, the amount of pleasurable time spent with the
adult children and in general how well the living
arrangements were working out.
   The result: A full 70% of the parents were well satisfied
with the co-resident situation. Only one in four reported
disagreements as often as once a week, and the intensity of
the arguments "appeared to be quite low." Moreover, most of
the parents recounted frequent enjoyable conversations and
shared leisure activities with the child.
   If the children were unemployed or otherwise financially
dependent, however, parent-child conflict increased. The
return home of a divorced or separated child often strained
relationships, too -- particularly with fathers. If
grandchildren were also brought back into the nest,
additional strain was reported by both mothers and fathers.
                                                                                                       

   Poor Mothers Share
   Traits, Aid or No
                                                                                                       

   WELFARE MOTHERS and poor mothers not on welfare have many
characteristics in common.
   Child Trends, a nonprofit research organization based in
Washington, analyzed several large government surveys to see
how women getting help from the government's Aid to Families
with Dependent Children program differed from poor mothers
not receiving such help and also from mothers with greater
incomes.
   Not surprisingly, both the AFDC and the other poor mothers
tend to be younger than mothers who aren't poor, consisted of
larger proportions of minorities, had less schooling and did
less well on intelligence tests, and had somewhat larger
families (though not as large as in former years, the
researchers note).
   What was unexpected, though, were the many similarities
between the two impoverished groups. For example, 31% of each
group had their first child before they were 17 and another
one-fourth before they were 20. Nearly one-third of each
group held the traditional attitude that mothers of young
kids shouldn't work, and another 30% leaned that way.
   Just about half of each group had finished high school and
another 12% had some college as well -- figures the analysis
characterizes as "higher than often assumed." Despite this,
intelligence test scores of both the AFDC mothers and the
non-welfare poor mothers were well below average and almost
identically so.
   But there were differences between the AFDC mothers and
the other poor mothers, of course. Many more AFDC mothers had
never been married, while many more non-AFDC poor were
divorced, separated, or widowed. More AFDC mothers were black
or Hispanic, and the AFDC group was also more likely to have
alcohol-related problems.
                                                                                                       

   States of Health Vary
   From State to State
                                                                                                       

   MINNESOTA and Utah are the healthiest states, Alaska the
least healthy.
   So says a complex rating system developed by Northwestern
National Life Insurance Co. The system, worked out with the
help of a panel of health experts, ranks states on the basis
of weights assigned to 17 different components of health,
subdivided into five broad categories: life style, access to
health care, incidence of major diseases, extent of disabling
injuries and sicknesses, and death rates. Included in life
style, for instance, are the prevalence of smoking, amount of
violent crime, number of auto deaths, prevalence of obesity
and other factors contributing to heart disease, and
percentage of high school graduates.
   Utah won a tie for first place for overall healthiness by
coming in first in the life-style category and ranking well
on mortality, disease and disability, though it was only 20th
on access to health care. Minnesota tied with Utah by getting
high grades on disease, mortality, access to health care, and
life style, though it didn't do so well on the disability
scale.
   New Hampshire and Hawaii were close behind the top two,
followed by Nebraska, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Wisconsin
and Iowa. Connecticut ranked first on access to health care,
North Dakota had the lowest death rates, Wyoming had the best
record on major diseases, and Hawaii had the least
disability.
   Other than Alaska, the states ranked the worst were West
Virginia, Mississippi, Nevada, Louisiana and New Mexico.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   AVERAGE child-support payments by absent fathers increased
16% in real terms from 1985 to 1987, the Census Bureau
reports. This contrasts with a drop of 12% from 1983 to 1985.
. . . Catholic schools enroll 54% of all private school
students, according to the Department of Education. Other
religious schools account for 30% and nonsectarian schools
for the remaining 16%. . . . Elderly white women in the
Southeast suffer substantially more hip fractures than those
in the North, University of Illinois epidemiologists
discover. They admit they have found no good explanation for
this variation. . . . The government's Agency for Health Care
Policy estimates that over 13 million Americans, including
one out of six between the ages of 45 and 65, have a disabled
elderly parent or spouse.

   America West Says
   Talks on Pan Am
   Shuttle Continue

   America West Airlines said it is continuing talks with Pan
Am Corp. over the possible acquisition of Pan Am's East Coast
shuttle but that an agreement hasn't been reached.
   The Phoenix, Ariz., carrier also said it is still
negotiating a possible lease of more than 100 Airbus
Industrie A320 jets in a transaction that would involve
financial support from manufacturers and leasing companies.
No agreement has been reached in those talks, America West
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a statement yesterday, America West's president,
Michael J. Conway, declined to say what price is under
discussion for the Pan Am shuttle but termed recent public
speculation "premature and not well founded." A spokesman for
New York-based Pan Am declined to comment.
   When Pan Am announced the shuttle was for sale, it said it
hoped to get about $250 million for it. Since then, however,
conditions in the airline industry have worsened
substantially.
   Pan Am put the shuttle up for sale in late May, not long
after cash-strapped developer and executive Donald Trump put
out feelers to determine how much money he might get from
selling the competing Trump Shuttle. Financially ailing Pan
Am has been selling assets and reorganizing to try to raise
cash.
   Last week, Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett told Wall
Street analysts he expected to sell the shuttle by year end
but that he didn't expect any sale to actually be final until
1991. Mr. Plaskett also said the airline will cut 8.6% of its
work force, slash its 1991 capacity by 7.5% and switch to
smaller, more efficient jets from Boeing Co.'s fuel-guzzling
747s on several of its trans-Atlantic routes.
   America West -- with hubs in Phoenix and Las Vegas and
with mostly Southwestern routes -- has for years sought a
toehold in the lucrative New York and Washington markets.
Owning a Northeast shuttle could provide that kind of access.
Last year, America West gamely tried to outbid Mr. Trump for
the Eastern Airlines shuttle after Eastern took refuge in
bankruptcy court. Negotiating right up to the deadline,
America West ultimately couldn't come up with the financing.
   It's unclear how America West might finance the
acquisition of the Pan Am shuttle, which like the Trump
operation connects New York to Boston and Washington. A
person familiar with the talks said the proposed aircraft
deal calls for America West to get $200 million in financial
aid from Guinness Peat Aviation -- the company that would
lease America West 26 of the A320s -- and from International
Aero Engines, a consortium of five engine manufacturers.
Airbus itself wouldn't provide any of the money, the person
said.
   The person said this financial aid could help underwrite
the purchase of the shuttle or help meet the costs of
introducing Airbus planes into the all-Boeing America West
fleet. The person said the two potential transactions aren't
dependent on each other.
   Half of the 100 A320s involved were ordered originally by
Pan Am. But in late 1988, Pan Am sold those delivery
positions to now-defunct Braniff Airlines. Braniff added
options on 50 more jets.
   Braniff folded last fall, leaving ownership of the planes
and delivery positions the subjects of bankruptcy court
litigation. A few A320 jets that were delivered have been
parked at the Las Vegas airport. Those and the remainder of
the Braniff order form the core of the transaction under
discussion between America West and Airbus.

   Senate Supporters of Fuel Economy Bill
   Lose Vote, Dooming Measure This Year

   WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers pushing legislation to tighten
fuel-economy rules for cars lost a procedural vote in the
Senate, dooming the bill's chances for this year.
   Separately, the Environmental Protection Agency released
data showing that nine of the 10 most fuel-efficient
1991-model cars are made in Japan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Senate supporters of the bill fell three votes short of
the 60 needed to cut off a filibuster by opponents. The vote
was 57-42. The measure was opposed by the administration and
the auto industry.
   The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Richard Bryan (D.,
Nev.), would require auto makers to increase the fuel
efficiency of their fleets 20% in the model year 1995 and 40%
by 2001.
   Among other administration efforts against the bill,
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner two weeks ago called
a news conference to release studies asserting that the
measure would result in additional highway accidents and
deaths. And along with Energy Secretary James Watkins and
Environmental Protection Agency chief, William Reilly, Mr.
Skinner sent a letter opposing the measure to Senate leaders
this week.
   Sen. Bryan said in an interview that "the administration
really brought out its heavy artillery" to defeat the bill.
Nonetheless, he said the vote indicated considerable support
for tougher fuel-economy standards among lawmakers, and he
added that he looked forward "to waging a new battle" for the
bill next year.
   The auto makers were delighted by the Senate vote. A
spokesman for Toyota Motor Co. said, "It looks like the bill
is dead this year. We think {that is} great."
   The fuel-economy bill, once viewed largely as an
anti-pollution measure, gained new momentum as an oil-saving
proposal in the wake of the Mideast crisis. Proponents were
buoyed two weeks ago when they won an earlier procedural vote
by a wider margin than expected. Following that vote,
however, the White House stepped up its lobbying, which
helped to defeat yesterday's effort.
   Moreover, the bill's chances always were less certain in
the House, where it was pending before the House Energy and
Commerce Committee. Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman
of that panel, is a longtime champion of the auto industry.
   The EPA rankings listed the subcompact Geo Metro XFI as
the most fuel-efficient car, at 53 miles per gallon for city
driving and 58 mpg on the highway. The car is made by Suzuki
and sold by General Motors Corp.
   Eight other Japanese-made cars and one from West Germany
rounded out the top-10 list. They are the Honda Civic CRX HF,
GEO Metro, Geo Metro LSI, Suzuki Swift, Honda Civic CRX HF,
Geo Metro LSI Con, Suzuki Swift, Daihatsu Charade and the
Volkswagen Jetta.
   The 10 least fuel-efficient cars all come from Europe,
with the Lamborghini DB132/Diablo topping the list. It gets
nine mpg in the city and 14 on the highway, the EPA said.
Purchasers of this model have to pay a $3,200 gas-guzzler
tax.
   The EPA figures on fuel efficiency have been released
annually since 1974.

   Oil prices generally pulled back after Monday's sizzling
gains.
   Traders and analysts attributed the pause to a correction
and to profit-taking in what has been a frenzied market.
Whatever the reason, futures prices for so-called
prompt-month crudes fell in both New York and London.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November crude
contract, which surged $2.82 a barrel Monday, fell 72 cents
yesterday to settle at $37.53. December crude was up $1.25 a
barrel to $36.07, but that was a catch-up move after exchange
limits held its Monday gain to $1.50.
   On the International Petroleum Exchange in London, crude
oil futures for November and December delivery were lower
after Monday's stunning run-ups. The November contract
dropped 58 cents a barrel to settle at $37.10, while December
crude fell 62 cents to $35.50.
   There were continuing reports of some North Sea crudes
being priced at more than $40 a barrel, but trades at these
"notional" levels weren't confirmed. Meanwhile, some fuel
prices weakened.
   In U.S. futures trading, heating oil for October delivery
fell 2.72 cents to settle at $1.012 a gallon. Unleaded
gasoline for October delivery fell 2.18 cents to $1.0205 a
gallon, and traders said the gasoline market actually was
much weaker than that for heating oil.
   One reason for the slackening of interest in gasoline was
concern in the market that the latest weekly report by the
American Petroleum Institute would show another big buildup
in inventories. That could mean demand for motor fuel would
fall more quickly than seasonal factors would suggest, mainly
because of the slowing U.S. economy and motorist reaction to
the past few weeks' surge in prices at the gasoline pump.
   The report, released as usual after the futures market had
closed, appears to have confirmed those market fears.
Although the API reported a decline of 5.7 million barrels in
crude oil inventories last week, it also showed that gasoline
inventories rose by nearly 5.3 million barrels, a much bigger
increase than had been expected.
   "This definitely removes the bullish scenario for
gasoline," said Andrew Lebow, an energy analyst with E.D.&amp; F.
Man International Futures. He had been expecting an increase
of only 200,000 to 1.2 million barrels in gasoline
inventories.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased. December delivery
gold was off 70 cents an ounce to $407.60. December silver
slipped eight cents an ounce to $4.9150. October platinum
dropped $8.90 an ounce to $451.80. Oil prices took a
breather, backing away from their recent strong advances in
the absence of any new threatening rhetoric from Iraq. As a
result, precious metals also retreated from Monday's gains.
The small size of the decline in gold indicated that the
metal still has a strong underpinning, according to analysts.
Also a supporting factor was that producer selling hasn't yet
appeared. It did appear to some degree in silver and
platinum, however, one analyst said. Because those markets
have less investor interest and are thinly traded, they
showed significant losses. Another saving grace for gold, the
analyst said, was that industrial demand for it is remaining
strong, while demand for platinum is dropping with sagging
automobile sales. Yesterday, U.S. auto makers reported a drop
in sales for mid-September.
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Futures prices closed mixed in
moderate trading. Soybean futures for November delivery
gained four cents a bushel to $6.175 on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices were supported partly by the outlook for
continued dry weather in the Mississippi River valley and
some other Southern growing areas, analysts said. Because of
the dry weather, "there's a feeling that soybean yields are
less than they were two to three weeks ago," said Conrad
Leslie, a futures analyst in Chicago. December corn futures
fell one cent a bushel to close at $2.2775, and December
wheat futures edged one-half cent a bushel lower to $2.7475.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Most futures prices eased. The September contract,
which will cease trading today, was up 0.80 cent a pound at
$1.2920, mostly because of a relatively large number of
contracts remaining to be fulfilled by delivery of the
commodity or nullified by offsetting trades. Warehouse stocks
of copper for delivery against the September contract are
low. December, however, was off 0.55 cent a pound to $1.1750
after trading in a wide range. The market was influenced by
the liquidation that has continued since prices fell in
London last week, one analyst said. However, he said, demand
for copper remains strong in West Germany, Japan and even the
U.S., where buying interest has held up despite the slowdown
in the economy. According to another analyst, copper prices
have a good prospect of rebounding because North American
supplies are relatively tight and futures have tended to be
oversold recently.

   Ask Sentence
   Of Urban Work

   U.S. to Release Allegations
   That Paint Defendant
   As a Major Wrongdoer

   NEW YORK -- Michael Milken's lawyers urged a federal judge
to view Mr. Milken's crimes as aberrations in an otherwise
exemplary life and to sentence him to perform full-time
community service with inner city youths in Los Angeles.
   Meanwhile, prosecutors prepared to release a barrage of
new allegations painting Mr. Milken as a white-collar
criminal of major proportions, in its effort to get a stiff
prison sentence for the former king of junk bonds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The conflicting views about the former Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. official appear in sentencing memoranda prepared
by the two sides. Mr. Milken's memorandum was made public
yesterday. The government's memorandum is expected to be
released today.
   Mr. Milken is scheduled to be sentenced next Monday by
U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood for six trading-related crimes
to which he pleaded guilty last April. Mr. Milken admitted to
one count each of conspiracy, filing a false statement with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, securities fraud,
aiding and abetting net-capital violations, mail fraud and
assisting the filing of a false tax return. He faces a
maximum of 28 years in prison.
   The pre-sentencing memos have taken on great importance,
because the government is alleging that Mr. Milken committed
numerous securities-related crimes -- including insider
trading -- beyond those included in his plea bargain. And
prosecutors are urging Judge Wood to consider these further
allegations against Mr. Milken as reasons to dole out what
they have called a "substantial" prison sentence.
   People named in the government's memo had sought to keep
the additional unproved allegations sealed, but, at the
request of news organizations, Judge Wood ordered them to be
made public, with the names of people who had not been
charged with crimes blacked out.
   Judging from Mr. Milken's reply memoranda, the
prosecutors' memo accuses Mr. Milken of systematically
engaging in criminal behavior throughout much of the 1980s,
working in concert with convicted former stock speculator
Ivan F. Boesky and a host of other clients. The government
also accused Mr. Milken of being a "greedy" individual who
depended on corrupt dealings to enhance Drexel's market share
and his own compensation, which reached $550 million in 1987.
   Lawyers for Mr. Milken took issue with the government's
entire memorandum, saying that it was "written without regard
to legal or factual constraint, seemingly to appeal to the
public and to pressure the Court" to issue a stringent
sentence. Mr. Milken's attorneys contested each allegation
that went beyond the six charges to which he pleaded guilty.
And they accused the government of "sneaking in through the
back door" evidence of offenses that Mr. Milken has "never
acknowledged and has never committed."
   Although many details in the government's sentencing memo
have already come to light in the SEC complaint filed against
Mr. Milken and others in 1988 and in the 90-count indictment
of Mr. Milken filed in March 1989, the government presented
some new allegations in its sentencing memo, according to Mr.
Milken's reply.
   Among other charges, the government said in its memo that
Mr. Milken built Drexel's business and achieved personal
financial rewards through insider trading.
   Mr. Milken didn't plead guilty to any insider
trading-related charge. But in its memo, the government
presents four instances of alleged insider trading from which
it said Drexel benefited, involving securities of Caesars
World Inc., Viacom Inc., Republic Airlines and Lorimar Inc.
In each of these transactions, the government alleges that
Mr. Milken directed Drexel traders to trade on the basis of
material nonpublic information that Mr. Milken possessed as a
result of his role as a financial adviser to companies
pondering mergers.
   The government also claimed that Mr. Milken provided
"tips" and "advice," as well as illegal payoffs, to certain
money managers and others who were among Drexel's best
clients.
   Names of these individuals were blacked out in Mr.
Milken's memo. But according to people with knowledge of the
government's investigation, those who received allegedly
illegal payoffs include former money manager David Solomon;
former First Investors Management Co. junk-bond portfolio
manager Ben Bayse; and Thomas Spiegel, former chief of
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association.
   Mr. Solomon, who has received immunity from prosecution,
is cooperating with the government. Mr. Bayse left First
Investors last year, and the firm's lawyer has said First
Investors funds weren't in any way "harmed" by Mr. Bayse's
activities; the lawyer has declined to elaborate. Attorneys
for Columbia and Mr. Spiegel have acknowledged that the firm
is under investigation and have denied wrongdoing.
   According to the government, Mr. Milken offered personal
investment opportunities to favored customers in exchange for
their promises to purchase securities from Drexel. In one of
these transactions, the government alleges that Mr. Milken
improperly gave certain money managers and corporate
executives an opportunity to invest in Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co.'s 1985 acquisition of Storer Communications
Inc.
   In a previously reported allegation, Mr. Milken encouraged
these money managers to buy risky securities by allowing them
to buy equity warrants at relatively cheap prices. The
warrants were held in a Drexel-organized partnership known as
"MacPherson."
   According to the Milken reply memo, the government also
details a number of crimes that it said Mr. Milken committed
with Mr. Boesky, beyond the three Boesky-related offenses to
which Mr. Milken pleaded. And the government provides
additional evidence about Mr. Milken's dealings with Columbia
Savings &amp; Loan, without referring to the thrift by its name.
The government alleges that Mr. Milken helped the Beverly
Hills, Calif., S&amp;L obtain tax benefits by purchasing
securities from Columbia, with the understanding that those
securities would later be sold back at a pre-arranged time
and price.
   Finally, according to Mr. Milken's memo, the government
says that Mr. Milken had obstructed justice by ordering the
destruction of documents after Mr. Boesky agreed to plead
guilty to securities fraud in November 1986.
   Regarding the specific allegations, Mr. Milken's attorneys
say the insider-trading allegations are refuted by documents
and testimony that the government has in its possession. In
three of the cases, the attorneys say, "Mr. Milken did not
discuss the trades" with his traders.
   Mr. Milken never tipped favored customers about deals
either, his attorneys contend. Instead, they say, he merely
provided investment advice to money managers who requested
it. Mr. Milken's lawyers also disagree with the government's
position on MacPherson.
   They say that Mr. Milken didn't have to bribe money
managers to purchase the risky securities; these securities,
they say, were valuable and highly profitable. Mr. Milken's
lawyers say the warrants sold to money managers were
"speculative" investments and had nothing to do with these
managers' agreement to buy risky securities.
   Moreover, Mr. Milken's attorneys say their client had been
given approval by Drexel to establish MacPherson and to own
Storer warrants. In a series of interviews, however, senior
Drexel executives have denied that any such approval was ever
granted and have indicated that they had no knowledge of the
fund managers and other executives' participation in
MacPherson.
   Mr. Milken's lawyers also take issue with the government
concerning the payment of $5.3 million to Drexel by Mr.
Boesky. Both the government and other Drexel officials have
alleged that the payment was made to turn over to Drexel its
gains in a series of illegal trades, in which Mr. Boesky held
stock for Drexel with the understanding that it would be sold
back at a later date.
   In their sentencing memo, Mr. Milken's lawyers argue that
the $5.3 million was a payment for "services rendered," a
theory that Drexel rejected after its own guilty plea in
1988. They also deny that Mr. Milken directed anyone to
destroy documents.
   The second prong of Mr. Milken's argument seeking a
lenient sentence focuses on his character and good works. His
lawyers' memo relies heavily on more than 170 letters that
have been sent to Judge Wood by Mr. Milken's friends, family
and associates. Quoted extensively are letters by New York
takeover attorney Joseph Flom; Steven Ross, chairman of Time
Warner Inc.; and Daryl Gates, the Los Angeles chief of
police, among others.
   According to the memo, the letters "paint a portrait of .
. . a person of great conscience, compassion and charity who
has always been generous with his time, money and spirit."
   Mr. Milken, his lawyers say, possessed "unusual talents
and compassion" at an early age. By the first grade, he could
perform complicated multiplications in his head. After
school, he tutored fellow students in math. And "as a
schoolboy, Michael organized numerous school charity drives
and volunteered his time, services and modest allowance money
to an array of local charities."
   This work and charity ethic has continued throughout his
later life, his lawyers say.

   Shearson's Hill
   Named Co-Head
   At Lehman Bros.

   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. named its
best-known investment banker, J. Tomilson Hill, to be co-head
of its reconstituted Lehman Brothers division.
   The move continues nearly a year of management change at
Shearson, the American Express Co. securities unit that is
restructuring after being buffeted by financial problems.
Lehman Brothers has been resurrected as the new name for the
investment-banking and trading half of Shearson.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The appointment of the 42-year-old Mr. Hill has symbolic
significance. It means that the co-chief executive officers
of Lehman Brothers -- Mr. Hill and Richard S. Fuld Jr., 44 --
both are veterans of the old Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc.
investment bank that Shearson acquired in 1984. This might
help Shearson as it tries to play up the Lehman Brothers
mystique, though relatively few Lehman veterans remain at
Shearson.
   As Lehman's co-chief, Mr. Hill succeeds Sherman R. Lewis
Jr., 53. Mr. Lewis, a Shearson veteran, has been increasingly
taking on corporate duties at Shearson since the firm began
shaking up management in November 1989. Mr. Lewis will become
one of two Shearson vice chairmen, joining Ronald J. Yoo, and
continue to be a senior investment banker.
   People on Wall Street weren't surprised that Shearson
named Mr. Hill to the post; he has been Shearson's point man
in some of its biggest investment banking deals in recent
years -- including the $14 billion merger of Time Inc. and
Warner Communications Inc. last year, which garnered Shearson
$48.5 million in fees. As one of three co-heads of the
investment banking department, the helicopter-hopping Mr.
Hill has tried to maintain Shearson's contacts with corporate
chief executives, a difficult job considering Shearson's
internal turmoil over the past year.
   "The lion's share of my time will still be spent with
clients," Mr. Hill said in an interview.
   Mr. Fuld said that while it "wasn't part of the grand
plan" to have two Lehman veterans running the division, he
thinks it's "nice" that it worked out that way. Only five of
the 11 members of the Lehman Brothers management committee
are Lehman veterans. But Mr. Hill argues, "That speaks to the
diversity of the management team here, as we've been
re-introducing the Lehman Brothers concept."
   In addition to their co-chief executive titles, Mr. Hill
will be vice chairman of Lehman Brothers, while Mr. Fuld
remains president of the division.
   The 140-year-old Lehman Brothers name still carries cachet
on Wall Street, especially among older bankers who remember
the House of Lehman and its reputation for investment-banking
prowess. Shearson's new management sent down from American
Express has hoped that the new name would bolster morale.
   Such boosts are needed these days as the pace of the
mergers and acquisitions business all around Wall Street has
dropped to seven-year lows, according to Securities Data Co.
The Lehman division is said to be profitable so far this year
-- relying more on stock and bond trading profits, and areas
of investment banking other than mergers -- but officials
wouldn't comment on that.
   When the "new" Lehman was recreated, the thought was to
"create an identity that is very clear in the marketplace,"
said Mr. Hill. "And despite the markets' being in a state of
disarray and some of the internal issues we've been
confronting, the fact we've been able to do as much business
as we have is really a tribute to the strategy."
   Added Mr. Fuld: "I think it has clearly given our people a
sense of identity. I think they've rallied around the name."
   The Lehman division includes 6,500 of Shearson's nearly
33,500 employees. Shearson remains the nation's
second-biggest brokerage firm behind Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., but
Shearson has slashed its payroll 6%, or 2,100 positions, this
year.
   Howard L. Clark Jr., Shearson's chairman, said Mr. Hill
was "at the forefront" of a firm-wide business review that
led to decisions earlier this year to pull out of various
nonessential businesses and close 67 of its U.S. branch
offices, leaving 450.
   A Harvard graduate who started his career at First Boston
Corp., Mr. Hill moved on to head Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co.'s mergers department. He joined the old Lehman Brothers
firm in 1982 as a managing director in its mergers
department. He has known Mr. Fuld, his new co-head, for about
a decade.
   Shearson said that Michael Madden and Mel Shaftel,
managing directors, will continue as co-heads of investment
banking. They had been sharing those duties with Mr. Hill.
James Stern remains head of merchant banking. Meanwhile,
Lehman veteran Frederick Frank, a 58-year-old senior managing
director, was named chairman of the investment banking
group's executive committee.
   Mr. Lewis, in a statement, said giving up his Lehman
Brothers position and becoming a Shearson vice chairman "is
the culmination of a process begun last November, when I
stepped back from day-to-day management of investment
banking."
   Messrs. Lewis, Hill, Fuld and Yoo all were elected to the
19-member Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. board
yesterday, along with Jonathan S. Linen, head of the Shearson
Lehman Brothers division. That division, the other half of
Shearson, includes the firm's more than 9,000 brokers and its
money-management operations.

   U.N. Imposes Air Embargo Against Iraq;
   Shevardnadze Warns of Military Action

   The United Nations Security Council extended the land and
sea embargo of Iraq to the air, and the Soviet foreign
minister warned Baghdad that it could face military action
unless it withdraws from Kuwait.
   The council, with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze in the chair, voted 14-1 to impose an air
embargo against Moscow's former client state, with only Cuba
in opposition. It also said it would consider taking measures
against nations that violate the U.N. sanctions imposed
against Baghdad.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The resolution pointedly noted that continued Iraqi
defiance of U.N. policy "could lead to further serious
action" by the Security Council. That appeared to be an echo
of a warning by Mr. Shevardnadze that the U.N. has the
authority to sponsor military action.
   But there were no signs Iraq was backing down. The
Pentagon released new figures showing further massive Iraqi
troop concentrations in and near Kuwait, and Turkish
President Turgut Ozal warned Mr. Bush that it may be
"difficult" to get Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to withdraw
his occupation forces from Kuwait.
   In a taped television message to the American people, the
Iraqi president said a war against Iraq would be bloodier
than the Vietnam conflict. He blamed the international
condemnation of Iraq on a "conspiracy" led by the U.S. to
punish him for supporting Palestinian Arabs. However, he also
said conflict could be avoided through dialogue with the U.S.
   Under the Security Council resolution, nations won't allow
any flights between their territory and Iraq or Kuwait.
Further, they won't allow flights over their territory unless
the involved aircraft land for inspections to ensure that
they aren't carrying embargoed items. The resolution exempts
the transport of food or medical supplies for humanitarian
purposes, but such cargoes could be sent only under strict
international supervision.
   The resolution doesn't spell out a specific penalty for
violators. But it does include a provision stating that the
council will consider measures against countries that violate
the embargo. It also calls on all nations to detain any ship
of Iraqi registry that enters their ports, if it is found to
violate the sanctions.
   Following the vote, Secretary of State James Baker told
the council that "the more effective the enforcement of
sanctions, the more likely the peaceful resolution of this
conflict."
   Earlier in the day, Mr. Shevardnadze warned Iraq that the
U.N. might exercise its right to "suppress acts of
aggression" militarily if the Iraqis don't withdraw from
Kuwait.
   "A great war may break out in the {Persian} Gulf region
any day, any moment," the Soviet official told the U.N.
General Assembly in a tough speech that also hinted that
Saddam Hussein should be tried for his recent acts, including
hostage-taking.
   The Defense Department said Iraq has massed 430,000
troops, 3,500 tanks, 2,500 armored personnel carriers and
around 1,700 artillery pieces in the large geographic region
the Pentagon defines as militarily near Kuwait. That is an
increase -- in just one week -- of 70,000 troops, 700 tanks,
700 personnel carriers and 200 artillery pieces.
   Mr. Shevardnadze seemed to emphasize the military option
in the crisis far more than President Mikhail Gorbachev has.
"We should remind those who regard aggression as an
acceptable form of behavior that the United Nations has the
power to suppress acts of aggression," he said, quoting from
the U.N. charter. "There is already ample evidence that this
right can be exercised. It will be, if the illegal occupation
of Kuwait continues. There is enough unity in this regard in
the Security Council, and there is also the will and a high
degree of consensus in the world community."
   Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, mixed dire warnings of massive
violence with conciliatory signals in his taped address to
the American people. The Iraqi leader asserted that President
Bush "pushes your children to a war that has no human value
whatsoever."
   In his 75-minute taped speech, delivered in response to an
eight-minute address by President Bush that recently was
aired on Iraqi TV, the Iraqi leader said, "Let us resort to
dialogue rather than arms."
   He reasserted his claim that Kuwait has long been a
legitimate part of Iraq and that his military move into
Kuwait was justified because Kuwait was waging economic war
against Baghdad by driving down oil prices. But he
embellished Iraq's justifications by charging that Kuwait's
actions against Iraq were part of a grander international
conspiracy, involving both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, to
cripple Iraq, largely because of its support for the
Palestinian cause.
   At the White House, President Bush rewarded Turkish
President Ozal for his support in the Gulf crisis by pledging
greater economic and military help. The new aid includes an
unspecified increase in Turkey's textile quotas to the U.S.,
more military assistance including F-16 fighter jets, a hefty
share of the international aid the U.S. has raised for
countries hurt by the crisis, and greater U.S. support for
Turkey's bid to join the European Community.
   Deputy Assistant Secretary of State James Dobbins told
reporters that Mr. Ozal counseled the president that the
sanctions would begin to bite in two to four months, and that
the true strength of Iraq's military had been routinely
exaggerated in the West. However, Mr. Dobbins also quoted Mr.
Ozal as saying that "flexibility was not a strong point" with
Saddam Hussein and that it would be "difficult" to get him to
back down.
   The two presidents, Mr. Dobbins said, complained about the
recent increases in the price of oil and charged that prices
"were not being set by supply and demand, but by speculative
pressures." He said the leaders believed there was adequate
oil at a much lower price and that the high prices would harm
many economies.
   Mr. Dobbins said the two presidents didn't discuss the war
option in sessions attended by aides, but the two men held a
private meeting at which the subject may have arisen. If war
breaks out, the U.S. probably will count on Turkey to send
forces, or at least menace Iraq from the Turkish-Iraqi
border.
   In another diplomatic development, Syrian President Hafez
Assad ended a visit to Tehran by issuing a joint statement
with Iranian leaders condemning both the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait and the presence of Western troops in the Persian
Gulf.
   Mr. Assad, who sides with the U.S. in the Gulf crisis,
said he had no differences on the matter with Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, whose government has been more
ambivalent. Syrian sources told Western news agencies that
Iran pledged to uphold the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq
but insisted that food could be shipped to Baghdad as a
"humanitarian" exception.
   American intelligence agencies say small amounts of food
from Iran have been slipping into Iraq, and they are worried
about several full Iraqi oil tankers, which they fear might
be heading for Iran to unload. The Bush administration had
hoped Mr. Assad could persuade Iran to avoid breaking the
embargo. Mr. Assad, Iran's only Arab ally, met with Secretary
of State James Baker 10 days ago.
   News agencies, citing Syrian sources, said Mr. Rafsanjani
told Mr. Assad that Iran wouldn't buy Iraqi oil, but that the
Syrian leader failed to win such guarantees on shipping food
to its old foe.

   The tourists were getting restless. In fact, they were
getting downright hostile.
   Here they stood, wilting in the 100-degree Florida heat on
a day dripping with importance for MCA Inc. The company's
touted, $650 million Universal Studios Florida in Orlando was
having its opening, and several major rides didn't even work.
The earth wasn't quaking, King Kong wasn't bellowing, and the
shark from "Jaws" wasn't snapping at pontoon boats, at least
not on cue.

   One band of sweaty malcontents, having paid full-price $29
admission, charged up to the assembled TV cameras, thrust
down their thumbs, and shouted, "We're going to Disney
World]"
   This was not a high-water mark for public relations, and
MCA's chairman, Lew Wasserman, and its president, Sidney J.
Sheinberg, weren't pleased. But they had pushed too hard,
opening the park in June before it really was ready.
   After years of indecision about creating the theme park,
and after a decade of missed opportunities, MCA had become
obsessed with proving itself capable of competing throughout
the world with Walt Disney Co., Time Warner Inc., Sony Corp.,
and News Corp.'s Fox. Yet it may have clung so long to its
traditional Hollywood ways that the only means of achieving
this goal was to be merged or acquired.
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. fills the bill: its
familiar brands are marketed world-wide and include
Panasonic, Quasar, Technics and National. Reacting to a
report in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, MCA announced that
it is talking with a major international company about a
buy-out.
   People knowledgeable about the talks say the takeover
price could range from $80 to $90 a share, or about $7.4
billion to $8.3 billion. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday MCA shares soared $19.50, to close at $54.
   People close to the situation say that MCA was in merger
discussions with Paramount Communications Inc. several weeks
ago, but that talks broke off because executives of the two
companies couldn't come to terms on sharing control.
Paramount declines comment but is said to be worried about
its existing joint ventures with MCA, notably the USA cable
network and the international film distributor U.I.P.
   It is far from certain that a Matsushita acquisition of
MCA will ever take place. But MCA appears to be "in play,"
and other bidding scenarios are possible. One of Matsushita's
appeals for MCA is that it's among the few companies so
wealthy it wouldn't have to spin off assets to support the
acquisition.
   The only required sale would be the
U.S.-government-mandated divestiture of MCA's New York-area
TV station WWOR, which Disney and many others would love to
get their hands on. The merged company also could spin off
the TV station to MCA shareholders. However the Matsushita
talks turn out, a hostile takeover of MCA isn't likely
because Mr. Wasserman controls much of the company.
   An acquisition by Matsushita might leave MCA's management
intact. That was an issue -- and a stumbling block -- in
other talks over the years. A merger would give MCA new
international heft and more financial resources.
   But would MCA stay MCA, with all its current corporate
quirks? The botched opening and continued operational
problems at Universal Studios Florida raise questions about
whether a merged MCA would continue to pay for the missteps
of the past. And they lead observers to wonder whether the
corporate culture that served the company well in its early
years -- tough, arrogant, inflexible, and, above all,
conservative -- is right for the '90s.
   "Life is filled with missed opportunities," a
philosophical Mr. Sheinberg said Monday. "I prefer to look
forward. There's a lot ahead of us that looks optimistic, and
I'm generally pessimistic about most things." He wouldn't
comment about merger plans.
   Even before there was word of the Matsushita talks, change
was afoot in the Black Tower, MCA's cold, black glass world
headquarters in Universal City, just over a hill from Los
Angeles. It was exemplified by Mr. Sheinberg's recent
acquisition of Geffen Records for 12.5% of MCA's stock, worth
about $540 million. The deal, which takes effect at year-end,
demonstrated that the 77-year-old Mr. Wasserman finally had
passed leadership of MCA to Mr. Sheinberg, who is likely to
stay on should Matsushita actually acquire MCA.
   "The Geffen deal was Sid's decision," says investment
manager Mario Gabelli, who controls 4% of MCA's stock. "You
don't make a decision about 10 million shares unless you're
running the company."
   The changes at MCA aren't entirely self-generated. The
company needed a nudge, and it came last year in the form of
the multibillion-dollar merger of Time Inc. and Warner
Communications Inc. "We're a 200-pound gorilla in a game with
1,000-pound gorillas," Mr. Wasserman told one MCA
shareholder. "We've got to become a 1,000-pound gorilla, or
get out of the game."
   MCA has been at the game a long time. In Hollywood, where
marquees are continually changing, Mr. Wasserman and Mr.
Sheinberg, who is 55, have been the longest-running show in
town. Mr. Wasserman, who with the late Jules Stein built MCA
from a tiny band-booking agency that had its beginnings in
the Chicago of the 1920s, is still treated like a Roman
senator at industry functions. Mr. Sheinberg has been Mr.
Wasserman's head of operations since 1973. The two still make
the nostalgic trip to Chicago every year for the company's
annual meeting.
   Every day Mr. Wasserman and Mr. Sheinberg put on their
dark suits and ties and drive to their grim Black Tower. A
bust of Mr. Stein, who died in 1980, stands guard over the
elevator bank. He amassed warehouses of English antiques over
the years, and the building still groans with the collection.
Even the hippest, high-tech movie executives must toil amid
the hulking sideboards and horse-and-hound prints, which
suffice as office furnishings while others in Hollywood are
forever redecorating.
   MCA itself had become a bit musty and creaky. In a
changing world, MCA suddenly found itself no longer a
market-leading behemoth but a relatively small player. And
Mr. Wasserman, many observers felt, had become rather too
preoccupied with holding onto what he had built. He avoids
the press and declined to be interviewed for this story. But
the beauty of the Matsushita deal, individuals close to the
situation say, is that MCA can expand internationally without
needing equity partners, and shareholders can be rewarded
without breaking up the company or sending its management
packing.
   From its Prohibition-era start, MCA grew into a major
talent agency. It represented actor Ronald Reagan, among
others, in the '50s. Late in the decade it expanded into
movie and television production by buying Universal Studios,
which at the time was best known for "B" movies and horror
films. Universal eventually became a major supplier of
network TV shows, which generated cash to compensate for the
bumpy fortunes of the movie division. They have indeed been
bumpy. On the one hand, Mr. Sheinberg took on an unknown
director named Steven Spielberg, who went on to produce for
Universal the highest-grossing film of all time, "E.T. The
Extra-Terrestrial," released in 1982. But the studio also
passed up the opportunity to produce the 1981 movie "Raiders
of the Lost Ark." It put out the disastrous "Howard the
Duck."
   MCA, meanwhile, proved itself resistant to change. It
bitterly fought Sony Corp.'s introduction of the Betamax home
video recorder. A venture to market a competing videodisk
system that could play back but not record failed to
electrify consumers. And Mr. Sheinberg rancorously opposed
the growing power of pay-cable TV services such as Home Box
Office, now a Time Warner operation.
   At least twice in the past decade, MCA came close to
merging with other entertainment companies, once with the
then-independent RCA Corp., and later with Walt Disney Co.
shortly before the current management team took over at
Disney in 1984. Both times, questions arose about who would
control the merged entity -- questions that turned out to be
insurmountable, executives say.
   MCA seems to be trying to make up for lost time. In the
past year or so, it has divested itself of its troubled LJN
toy unit; it has taken charge of its ailing 49%-owned
Cineplex Odeon theater chain; and it has opened one, at least
temporarily troubled, theme park. (It is planning to build
two more parks, near Paris or London and in Japan.) MCA broke
with tradition to handsomely reward (with millions of dollars
in stock options) Thomas P. Pollock, the architect of its
movie division's newfound success, and it is finally about to
start developing a long neglected asset, 200 acres of
Universal City real estate at the junction of two Los Angeles
freeways.
   Yet Mr. Wasserman only reluctantly assented to Mr.
Sheinberg's strongly argued desire to buy WWOR-TV for $387
million. The station, based in Secaucus, N.J., serves the New
York market. He put a stop to plans to buy a big stake in
Hasbro Inc., the now struggling toy-industry giant. MCA
executives stood idly by watching Fox Inc. start a TV
network, something MCA might have attempted but didn't.
   MCA itself is primarily responsible for current problems
with its Florida studio tour, a vaster version of the
company's successful California attraction. Theme park chief
Jay Stein (no relation to Jules) recommended as early as 1969
that a Florida park be built, and MCA acquired land in
Central Florida with that in mind. But Mr. Wasserman, ever
gloomy about looming recessions and reluctant to take on
debt, insisted on more research and a partner with whom to
share the risk. Meanwhile, Disney opened Walt Disney World in
1971, EPCOT Center in 1982 and, finally, Disney-MGM Studios
last year. Little wonder that every time Mr. Stein is
interviewed, his vitriol about Disney bubbles up. A sample
comment re: Walt Disney World -- "Ask the kids. It's a
rip-off]"
   Although Mr. Stein's candor can seem refreshing compared
to Disney's happy-faced facade, some MCA executives contend
privately that his combativeness hurts MCA. Others say it was
arrogance that led the company to open in Orlando before the
park was ready -- and then to charge visitors full price.
Executives in Orlando apparently kept assuring the Black
Tower in L.A. that attractions would be operational
"tomorrow." Mr. Stein says he was misled by the rides'
designers. "We bought a lemon."
   Despite the negative publicity, analysts believe the park
will be profitable in the long run for MCA and the British
partner it ultimately found, Rank Organisation PLC.
   MCA's style clearly flows from Mr. Sheinberg. A lanky
Texas attorney, he has a hot temper and a legendary
proclivity to sue people. "At MCA, litigation is a profit
center," he once boasted. In an industry in which moguls can
be at one another's throats in court then dine together as
old friends, Mr. Sheinberg takes things personally. He
resigned from the board of the American Film Institute when
it accepted a contribution from Sony during MCA's bitter
battle seeking to block home video technology as a copyright
violation.
   While Disney executives carefully avoid knocking MCA in
public, Mr. Sheinberg growled once that Disney was a
"ravenous rat" and accused his competitor of stealing MCA's
theme-park ideas. Disney responds subtly. In worshipful
issues of Variety and the Hollywood Reporter honoring
Universal's 50th Anniversary this year, every major studio
but one bought ads.
   Mr. Sheinberg's frequent outbursts may also may have
contributed to Universal's failure to license its 1989 slate
of films to pay-cable networks, which are a vital source of
revenue for major studios.
   "I'm sick and tired of the process of trying to license
these films to pay cable," Mr. Sheinberg groused during
negotiations earlier this year, calling HBO and Viacom Inc.'s
Showtime "a monopoly." He threatened to take the films
directly to the commercial networks, and, in April, he did
sign a precedent-setting deal with CBS Inc. It was a creative
solution, but MCA undoubtedly left millions of dollars on the
table.
   Mr. Sheinberg also has conceded that he is attracted to
executives who can be as ornery as he is. That trait has led
directly to multimillion-dollar losses from MCA's investment
in Cineplex Odeon, the Toronto company that operates the
largest theater chain in North America.
   Mr. Sheinberg looks visibly pained when the subject is
broached. He was drawn to Cineplex's brash young founder
Garth Drabinsky, and saw him not just as a protege but almost
as a son. Yet Mr. Drabinsky hatched a plot to take over
Cineplex. It failed, and he was ousted last December, leaving
behind about $600 million in debt. MCA is still picking up
the pieces.
   "We found ourselves in a nightmare," says Mr. Sheinberg,
who at the last minute canceled an MCA table at a charity
fundraiser for Mr. Drabinsky last year, even though he was
co-chairman of the event. "I'm a victim of Garth Drabinsky's
charms. I'm a big boy, and I have nobody to blame but
myself." Mr. Drabinsky declines to comment.
   TV production, where MCA had been king, has fallen from
past heights. When the bottom dropped out of the TV
syndication market for hourlong dramas several years ago, MCA
fell hardest. How could a company create a hot cultural
phenomenon like "Miami Vice" -- and wind up losing money when
it went to sell the show to local stations for reruns? Mr.
Sheinberg blamed the networks for not paying their share of
production costs.
   Some in the syndication business were glad to see it
happen. At the annual National Association of Television
Programming Executives convention, for example, MCA had for
years refused to set up shop on the exhibition floor.
Instead, station managers would be summoned to a hotel suite
for an audience with MCA program sales people. Now humbled,
MCA is down on the floor. Never known for its sense of humor,
the TV division is still trying to become a presence in the
more lucrative business of producing half-hour comedy shows.
   Change still comes slowly to MCA. When Mr. Pollock joined
as president of the motion picture group in 1987, he couldn't
understand why Universal, alone among studios, insisted on
"firm terms" when it rented films to theaters, refusing to
adjust the percentage of ticket sales it keeps according to
how much business the film does.
   "Lew made it clear: How else do you know where you stand?"
says a now-converted Mr. Pollock. But the practice works well
only when films are in demand. During this past crowded
summer, Universal's "The Jetsons" didn't appear in some
cities at all because the studio's terms were too tough.
   Mr. Wasserman has also been obstinate about compensation.
While Disney and Warner executives were making millions on
stock options and incentive profit-sharing, MCA executives
made relatively little.
   Former records chief Irving Azoff left for an affiliation
with Warner because MCA wouldn't offer him a piece of the
action even though he had taken the division from a loss of
$8 million to operating profits of $60 million in five years.
Mr. Azoff was also frustrated because MCA wouldn't let him
buy Motown Records for $61 million (it's worth much more now)
or a significant stake in Polygram Records at a bargain
price. "I was a little too entrepreneurial for them," says
Mr. Azoff, "and they were a little too conservative for me."
   The lesson of Mr. Azoff's departure had some effect. MCA
soon broke precedent by offering Mr. Pollock stock options
valued at about $7.8 million as a reward for turning the film
division around. And the huge Geffen deal was done in less
than a week.
   Such happenings give longtime observers confidence that
MCA is on the move again. And the backing of Matsushita, with
annual sales of $44 billion in fiscal 1990, would give MCA
tremendous financial clout. "The company seems to be
energized, and it's becoming more opportunistic," says New
York investment banker Roy Furman. "They're not as deliberate
as they once were."
   MCA is even slowly changing its button-down style. Over
the hill from the Tower, in a funky office on the Sunset
Strip, five long-hairs in motorcycle jackets float through
the waiting room. Upstairs, a slender man in a T-shirt, jeans
and sneakers talks on the telephone as papers lie at his
feet. There is no desk. "Yes, Michael, I love you, too," he
says soothingly and hangs up.
   Who was that? "Michael Jackson," casually answers David
Geffen, 47, now MCA's largest stockholder. With his vast
network of contacts, Mr. Geffen is already undermining the
imperious, steely image of the company.
   Mr. Jackson himself is rumored to be thinking of taking
his recording career to MCA/Geffen. Similar rumors abound
about Bruce Springsteen.
   If Mr. Geffen knows everyone in the music business, his
Hollywood equal may be Mr. Pollock, 47, a onetime
entertainment industry lawyer who has pushed through
innovative deals MCA once would have resisted. Strong on
relationships but cost-conscious to a fault, he has indulged
the desire of box-office draw Arnold Schwarzenegger to do
light comedy roles that cost less to produce than action
films do. The successful Schwarzenegger film "Twins" will be
followed by "Kindergarten Cop." Controversial filmmaker Spike
Lee has also found a home at MCA.
   Messrs. Geffen and Pollock are joined on an operational
level by less-visible Charles "Skip" Paul, 41, a former Atari
Inc. executive who, as president of MCA Enterprises, has been
the troubleshooter on Cineplex Odeon, the toy company
divestiture and international theme park plans.
   Even without a Matsushita takeover, there are some wild
cards in MCA's future. While the company itself hasn't been
charged with any wrongdoing, both its record and its home
video division have been entangled in business deals with
reputed mobsters in recent years. The longtime president of
its Home Entertainment Group was dismissed last year after
accusations were made, based on FBI wiretap affidavits, that
he associated with organized crime figures.
   "I hope my grandchildren don't come home from kindergarten
and say someone said the mob has infiltrated MCA," responds
Mr. Sheinberg. "Does anybody really think that?"
   Mr. Sheinberg has long been coy about impending alliances
or mergers. After reporters rushed to a Los Angeles hotel
catering to Japanese businessmen last year on reports that
Sony was in discussions to buy MCA, an amused Mr. Sheinberg
showed up at an industry banquet sporting a Sony button and
told the audience that if coming Universal films weren't big
hits, "expect to see me selling closed-out Walkmans on some
street corner next year."
   Before the news of the Matsushita talks, he said MCA is
like an eligible young woman whom lots of people want to
date. "We're going to go to some dances," Mr. Sheinberg
added. "We may even get married."

   Amoco Corp. Elects Fuller Chairman,
   Chief, Succeeding Morrow in February

   Amoco Corp., the nation's fifth-largest oil company,
elected H. Laurance Fuller chairman and chief executive
officer.
   The 51-year-old Mr. Fuller, president of Amoco since 1983,
is known as a more gregarious executive than the current
chairman and chief executive, Richard M. Morrow, who has held
those jobs since 1983. "Larry could be an inspirational CEO,"
said Bryan Jacoboski, an oil analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in
New York. The job change is effective Feb. 27, when Mr.
Morrow retires.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As chairman, Mr. Fuller faces the job of improving the
performance of the company's oil and natural gas operations.
Also, like the rest of the industry, Amoco could face huge
environmental costs related to gasoline this decade. More
immediately, Amoco must figure out how to recover more of the
sharply higher crude costs encountered sicce the Iraqi
invasion. So far, the company has passed on only some of the
increase in the form of rising gasoline prices.
   In an interview, Mr. Fuller said, "The exploration and
production business is the one with the greatest challenge."
He added, "The rate of return we've had since the early '80s
is not adequate."
   The company needs to reduce its oil-finding costs, he
said. Unlike other oil giants, Amoco remains largely a
domestic exploration company, though in the past few years it
has made roughly two-thirds of its exploration expenditures
outside the U.S., compared with one-third in the past.
   "That's the direction of the future," Mr. Fuller said.
Despite the surge in oil prices to nearly $40 a barrel, Mr.
Fuller said Amoco is making its long-term exploration plans
based on prices in the low to mid-$20s.
   Amoco became the largest holder of natural gas reserves in
North America after it acquired Canada's Dome Petroleum in
1988 for $4.2 billion, but much of those reserves remain in
the ground. "The challenge is to take those gas reserves and
turn them into production," said Mr. Jacoboski, the
PaineWebber analyst.
   Mr. Fuller said there isn't enough available pipeline
capacity to move some of Amoco's gas, so the company may take
equity interests in planned pipeline projects to speed their
construction. Amoco also will open a Houston operation in
October to try to improve natural gas sales.
   In gasoline refining and marketing, where Amoco is
acknowledged to have a leading operation, short-term earnings
are being hurt because the company has been able to pass just
two-thirds of the huge increase in crude oil costs through to
gasoline prices, Mr. Fuller said.
   He added, however, "I would not represent that we're not
able to make money under these circumstances."
   Longer term, Mr. Fuller said Amoco may have to spend $1
billion to $2.5 billion on "environmental gasoline" through
the mid-1990s, depending on the outcome of the Clean Air
legislation in Washington.
   Mr. Fuller, who has a chemical engineering and law degree,
joined Amoco in 1961. He has held corporate posts since 1981
and was named head of the company's gasoline refining and
marketing business in 1978.
   "His first major management job was head of the refinery
in Casper, Wyoming," recalled John Swearingen, chairman of
Amoco until 1983. "I sent him out to Casper, a year later he
had everybody eating out of his hand."
   Mr. Fuller said he will retain his position of president.
"I don't think it will be long before we look at the
structure of the organization," he said, adding he would
contemplate changes in senior management between now and
February.

   Tokyo stocks finished broadly and substantially lower in
razor-thin trading Tuesday as the latest rise in oil prices
and falling bond prices kept investors off the trading floor.
   In London, shares finished higher, but only marginally
better than Monday's 20-month low and still under the 2000
support level on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share
Index.

   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 418.51 points, or
1.76%, to 23359.32.
   In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index fell another 437.69
points to close the morning session at 22921.63.
   Sentiment on Tuesday was also damped by sharp falls in
stock prices Monday in London and New York, which were also
prompted by higher oil prices, traders said.
   Most shares in Tokyo fell on a small amount of selling
because of the lack of buy orders, with big losers spread
among stocks sensitive to interest rates and oil prices.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 230 million
shares, down from 458 million shares Friday. The market was
closed Monday for a holiday.
   Decliners outnumbered gainers 825 to 139, while 92 were
unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was down 50.41 points, or 2.85%, at 1719.36.
   The second section index dropped 61.92 points, or 1.85%,
to 3280.17. Volume in the section was estimated at 4 million
shares, down from 7.9 million shares Friday.
   While most investors remained on the sidelines, the Nikkei
Index slumped under the pressures of a small amount of
arbitrage selling and sharp declines in bluechip shares from
selling by some foreign investors, traders said.
   Some traders, however, said stock prices could have fallen
more, taking into account that both oil prices and the
benchmark yield of Japanese bond rose to the highest levels
in about a decade.
   But stocks managed to finish well above intraday lows.
Partly helped by index-linked buying by investment trust
funds, the index bounced up whenever it neared 23200 points,
traders said.
   "There is a market consensus that we have to defend 23000
points to the last," said a senior trader at Wako Securities.
   If the Nikkei falls below 23000 points, it is said that
Japanese banks would no longer be able to meet new capital
ratio requirements of the Bank for International Settlements,
he said.
   Other financial institutions and securities firms will
also be eager to prevent further losses toward the end of
September as the value of their holdings are evaluated
according to market prices on the last day of the month, the
trader said.
   Tuesday was the first trading day for the second half of
Japan's fiscal year, which begins Monday.
   "I haven't seen such a quiet day at the beginning of a
month for a long time," said Atsushi Koishihara, general
manager of stock trading at Taiheiyo Securities.
   Brokerage houses, which are usually active buyers on the
first day of a month, were forced to remain on the sidelines
like other investors, Mr. Koishihara said. "We can't move
because if turnover continues to thin, we wouldn't be able to
sell what we would buy today," he said.
   "The Mideast situation is too unclear," a fund manager at
Nippon Life Insurance said.
   Speculation that a further rise in oil prices may push up
domestic interest rates even higher "put us in real
discomfort," he said.
   Kobe Steel again became the most heavily traded issue,
ending at 566 yen ($4.12), up 1 yen. A news conference
scheduled by Kobe Steel for the late afternoon prompted
speculative buying, traders said.
   After the market closed, Kobe Steel announced plans to
form a joint venture to produce and sell aluminum products in
Japan with Aluminum Co. of America.
   Electric power companies were sold as their earnings are
likely to be pushed down by higher oil prices, traders said.
Tokyo Electric Power fell 120 yen to 3070 yen, while Kansai
Electric Power fell 120 yen to 2330 yen.
   Blue-chip electricals also slumped, with Hitachi dropping
70 yen to 1210 yen and Matsushita Electric Industrial
declining 90 yen to 1630 yen.
   In London, traders said that the gains weren't significant
when compared to recent swings in the stock market, and don't
suggest a continuing upward trend. Traders remain uncertain
as to the course London will follow with so many domestic and
international concerns to contend with.
   The FT-SE 100 Share Index gained 8.9 points to 1999.2. The
Financial Times 30 Share Index rose 16.2 points to 1526.6.
Volume was 412.4 million shares, under Monday's level of
500.3 million.
   Building products group Tarmac PLC reported half-year
pretax profit down 36% to #97.8 million ($184.3 million),
prompting securities house Charterhouse Tilney to downgrade
its year-end pretax profit figure to #235 million from #265
million. However, the shares ended a penny higher at 195
pence on relief the results weren't worse, traders said.
   Thorn EMI, the music, rentals and electricals concern,
rose 15 pence to 598 pence. Traders attributed the gain as a
sympathetic rise in line with other entertainment stocks on
news that Matsushita is preparing to bid for MCA of the U.S.
   BAA, the airport ownership and management concern, fell 7
1/2 pence to 367 1/2 pence. Traders said that industial
conglomerate ADT had sold a large stake.
   Property investment and development group Land Securities
fell 5 pence to 449 pence. Traders said there had been much
stock on offer, after several months in which the share price
had been unreasonably high.
   Food maker Rank Hovis McDougall fell 5 pence to 279 pence.
Traders said the price eased as extra stock entered the
market.
   In the stores sector, supermarket chains Tesco and
Sainsbury ended lower. Both stocks, among the market's best
performers of late, were considered expensive by traders,
prompting profit-taking. Tesco dropped 6 pence to 218 pence,
while Sainsbury dropped 4 pence to 290 pence.
   Elsewhere, shares closed lower in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Milan, Madrid and Brussels.
South African gold stocks closed higher.
   Also, stocks closed higher in Seoul, lower in Wellington,
Manila, Singapore, Hong Kong and Sydney.

   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., Chicago, fired 213 employees at its
unprofitable catalog unit as part of a broad attempt to cut
costs and improve retailing profits.
   The latest cuts represent 20% of the catalog unit's
headquarters staff, which is shrinking to 821 people, from
about 1,700 in January 1989. The catalog unit, with annual
sales of about $4 billion, hasn't made money since 1985.
Sears predicts it will be profitable next year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sears also may reduce the number of employees staffing
catalog desks at its 850 stores and its free-standing catalog
offices. The company currently is installing a new computer
system that it expects will reduce the time required to
handle merchandise returns by 35% to 40%. That system, now in
operation at 200 catalog locations, could result in further
staff reductions, a spokesman acknowledged.

   Cummins to Report
   Third-Quarter Loss

   COLUMBUS, Ind. -- Cummins Engine Co. said it expects to
report a loss for the third quarter as a result of slack
demand, even after a one-time gain of up to $34 million from
the repurchase of debt securities.
   The diesel-engine maker said that, excluding the gain, its
third-quarter loss will exceed the $39.7 million loss
reported in last year's third quarter. Slow North American
demand for heavy truck engines and related parts is expected
to continue through the fourth quarter, leaving the company
with a loss for that period as well, Cummins said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cummins said that it will report a $12 million
extraordinary gain in the third quarter from the repurchase
of $200 million principal amount of Liquid Yield Option
Notes, or Lyons, from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Inc. in a private transaction. The securities trade at a deep
discount to their face value and pay interest at maturity.
   The company said an additional one-time gain in the third
quarter of up to $22 million will be realized if all of the
$375 million principal amount of its remaining Lyon
securities outstanding are tendered in response to an offer
beginning today.
   Cummins said it intends to file an offering of as much as
$150 million in medium-term notes to fund the repurchase of
the Lyon securities. Also helping fund the repurchase will be
a private placement of $74 million in tax-advantaged notes by
Cummins's employee stock ownership plan. The private
placement proceeds will be used to repay a promissory note
the ESOP issued to the company in July 1989, Cummins said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Cummins shares rose $1.25 to close at $36.25.

   Inside Track:
   Bond Insurer MBIA's Chief Analyst Sold
   90% of Holding in August, Filings Show

   NEW YORK -- Leon J. Karvelis, chief analyst and head of
business development at municipal-bond insurer MBIA Inc.,
sold 90% of his stock in the company in late August,
according to filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   His sale, of 4,500 shares valued at $157,500, preceded the
huge hit the stock has taken recently on worries over the
financial stability of Philadelphia in particular, and of
state and local governments in general. MBIA has insured $122
million of the troubled city's bonds, which now carry "junk"
credit ratings, plus an even larger amount of municipals
whose interest payments are tied to revenue from
Philadelphia's operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Karvelis sold his shares at $35 a share on Aug. 23,
SEC filings show. Since then, the stock has fallen 29%; it
closed yesterday at $25, down 12.5 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   Mr. Karvelis, a well-known figure in the municipal bond
market who serves as chairman of the National Federation of
Municipal Bond Analysts, couldn't be reached for comment. The
sale was his second, and largest, stock sale since the
company went public in 1987, according to SEC filings.
Earlier in August, the filings show, Mr. Karvelis purchased
1,000 MBIA shares.
   David Elliott, president of MBIA, declined to comment
about the sale by Mr. Karvelis. Other company insiders have
used the stock's decline as a buying opportunity, although
their purchases have yet to be reported to the SEC, he said.
   As for the price of the company's stock, Mr. Elliott said,
"we've been swept up in the overall skittishness in the
market over financial services companies," such as troubled
banks, "even though we're a horse of a different color."
   The executive added that "it is not our belief that there
will be a default" by Philadelphia. And even if Philadelphia
were to default, MBIA could withstand it, he said.
   Richard Ciccarone, head of fixed-income research of Kemper
Capital Markets Inc. of Chicago, agreed. MBIA's exposure in
the event of a default by Philadelphia on all of its
MBIA-insured bonds would be roughly $9 million a year in debt
service, an amount that "would be definitely bearable" by the
company, Mr. Ciccarone said. Thus, to some degree, he said,
the stock's decline "may be a bit overplayed."
   Still, Mr. Ciccarone said, the stock market's worry is
that if Philadelphia could default, so could other municipal
bond issuers.
   According to MBIA, roughly 3% of the $70.6 billion of
municipals the firm has insured are on its "watch" list for
any changes in status.

   FAMILY MATTERS: The largest insider purchase reported to
the SEC in the latest week was made by Robert H. McKinney,
chairman of Somerset Group, an Indianapolis holding company
with interests in radio stations and building materials,
among other businesses. The company also holds a 23% stake in
First Indiana Bank.
   As shown in the accompanying Insider Trading Spotlight,
Mr. McKinney increased his direct holdings in the company by
22% with a $1 million private purchase of 122,063 shares on
Aug. 30 (see accompanying table -- WSJ Sept. 26, 1990). His
interest in the company also includes 92,967 shares owned
indirectly by his wife, his children and through a trust, SEC
filings show.
   A spokeswoman for the company said Mr. McKinney bought the
shares from family members, primarily nieces and nephews. Mr.
McKinney was unavailable for comment.
   He paid about $8.25 a share. In over-the-counter trading
Somerset Group shares closed yesterday at $6 a share, down 25
cents.

   SALE ON COOKWARE: Two insiders at Williams-Sonoma Inc.,
the San Francisco-based retailer of gourmet cookware and
appliances, sold a total of 80,000 shares for more than $2
million in late July, according to SEC filings.
   The insider sales were part of the company's public
offering of 1.4 million of shares last July, said James
Reilly, chief financial officer. The $21 million in proceeds
from the sale was used to pay down short-term debt and to
fund store openings and expansions, he said. The chain will
open 15 new stores by year's end, expanding its operations to
148 stores nationwide.
   Of the 1.4 million shares sold in the offering, 513,000
were sold by insiders, but all their filings have not yet
been received by the SEC, Mr. Reilly said.
   The filings show Patrick Connolly, a director and vice
president of the mail-order division, sold 50,000 shares on
July 31 at $25.50 a share. The stock represented 17% of his
company holdings, SEC filings show. The same day, Charles E.
Williams, a founder of the company and vice chairman of the
board, sold 30,000 shares. He has 132,000 shares remaining,
SEC filings show. The two executives weren't available for
comment.
   In national over-the-counter trading, the company's shares
closed yesterday at $14.25, down 25 cents.

   MCI Communications Corp. said it plans to offer
high-capacity data transmission services that can provide an
alternative to private-line service.
   MCI, the nation's second largest long-distance company,
said it will begin rolling out its "virtual private data
services" in mid-1991, beginning with switched services over
high-speed T1 and T3 circuits. T1 circuits have the capacity
of 24 telephone lines, while T3 circuits are equivalent to
672. Both are now available only as dedicated circuits or as
part of special services that must be reserved in advance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new data services, targeted primarily for big
corporate customers, were demonstrated at the
Telecommunications Association's annual convention in San
Diego, with Cray Research Inc. using switched T3 circuits to
link a supercomputer in Minneapolis with a workstation in San
Diego.
   Don Heath, MCI's vice president for data marketing, said
the new services mean that a "computer's location won't be an
obstacle" to researchers, industrial designers, financial
experts or other users.

   Paramount Names
   Kirkpatrick to Post
   At Production Unit

   Paramount Pictures Corp., in a move that has been rumored
for weeks, named David Kirkpatrick, 39 years old, as the
president of its motion picture group's production
operations.
   He succeeds Sidney Ganis, 50, who entered into an
exclusive long-term agreement yesterday to develop and
produce motion pictures for Paramount.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Kirkpatrick left Walt Disney Co. in July to become an
executive vice president of the motion picture group at
Paramount, where he had previously worked. Prior to his
tenure of more than a year at Disney, Mr. Kirkpatrick had
left Paramount to be president of the motion picture group of
Weintraub Entertainment Group for two years.
   Mr. Ganis and Mr. Kirkpatrick couldn't be reached for
comment. Frank Mancuso, the chairman of Paramount, a unit of
Paramount Communications Inc., also couldn't be reached. Mr.
Ganis's independent production agreement is a typical
arrangement when a top executive is replaced at a movie
company.
   The change is widely viewed in Hollywood as a move by
Paramount to bolster its future performance at the box office
and to allay concerns that it is too heavily focused on
marketing and distribution and not enough on creative
development, production and talent relationships. Although
Paramount has the current box office hit, "Ghost," it has
been disappointed by the results of other recent films such
as "Days of Thunder," and "The Two Jakes."
   Mr. Ganis joined Paramount in 1986 as head of marketing
and was named co-president of the motion picture group in
1988, responsible for production. The move raised eyebrows at
the time because Mr. Ganis had no previous experience in the
creative side of movie production, and didn't bring any
strong relationships with talent to the job.
   Although Mr. Ganis is widely liked and considered a
talented marketing strategist, he was unable to develop the
combination of talent relationships and tough negotiation
skills necessary to succeed at overseeing the studio's annual
production slate and dealing with often-difficult
negotiations over movie production issues, Hollywood
executives said.
   Mr. Kirkpatrick has never run a big studio's movie
operations either, but he has spent most of his career on the
production side of the business, and is known for cultivating
good talent relationships with producers, directors, writers
and actors. For example, he has a strong relationship with
Eddie Murphy, who is in the midst of renegotiating his
exclusive contract with Paramount, and one of the reasons he
was brought back was to help repair the rifts in that
relationship.
   "David has great expertise in talent relationships, and he
has strong creative production capabilities," said Jerry
Bruckheimer, who along with partner Don Simpson has an
exclusive production agreement at Paramount that has included
movies such as "Beverly Hills Cop II," "Top Gun" and "Days of
Thunder." Mr. Bruckheimer added, "He's been a great executive
to work with and he brings many years of expertise to the
job."
   Still pending against Mr. Kirkpatrick is a suit filed by
Disney charging that when he left Disney for Paramount, he
took another executive and a film project with him, in
violation of a contract. Mr. Kirkpatrick's attorney said the
suit was without merit. Ironically, Paramount sued Weintraub
and Mr. Kirkpatrick when he originally left the studio to
take the Weintraub post. The suit was finally settled.

   Pratt &amp; Whitney said cracks were found in 12 of its PW4000
jet engines used for wide-body jumbo jets, but that it saw no
danger to any airline passengers or problems for customers.
   The Hartford, Conn., unit of United Technologies Corp.,
said one of the 12 engines had been in service on an
airliner, but wouldn't identify the airline. Three other
engines had been shipped to aircraft makers -- two to Boeing
Co. and one to Airbus Industrie -- and the others were still
being assembled at Pratt facilities in Connecticut.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Pratt spokesman said the problem was traced to a
supplier in California that forged the engine shafts,
specifically to the heat-treating process used to harden
metals. He added the company began conducting emergency
inspections of engines delivered to aircraft makers or
airlines, and has found no further defects. He said the
company is cooperating with the Federal Aviation
Administration in an inquiry into the defects.

   Shares of FileNet Corp. plunged 43% after the Costa Mesa,
Calif.-based maker of document image-processing equipment
said it may report a small loss for the third quarter because
of "a significant number of delayed decisions" by potential

   NEW YORK -- Chase Manhattan Corp.'s big restructuring
isn't allaying the fears of one rating concern that harder
times are ahead for the nation's second-largest banking
concern.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. yesterday downgraded its
ratings on Chase's long-term debt and commercial paper.
Moody's cited the continued growth in Chase's nonperforming
real estate loans, the deteriorating Northeast economy and
the bank's exposure to other risky loans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Chase shares rose 87.5 cents, to close at $12, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Volume of
more than 1.7 million shares made Chase the fourth
most-active issue on the Big Board.
   Last Friday, Chase said it will fire 5,000 employees,
provide an additional $650 million for possible loan losses,
and slash its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share from 62
cents. Moody's said that these actions "are positive steps,"
but that it remains concerned about Chase's exposure to
commercial real estate, less-developed countries and highly
leveraged transactions.
   Moody's said the funding and liquidity positions of both
the holding company and its Chase Manhattan Bank unit remain
sound. It also said Chase's credit standing is supported by
management's capital-building efforts and the company's
significant undervalued assets.
   Chase said it was disappointed by Moody's actions. "Even
after the aggressive action Chase took on Sept. 21, our
capital is in excess of $11 billion and our capital ratios
exceed the government's guidelines that take effect in 1992,"
the bank said in a statement. The bank also noted that as
part of its restructuring announcement last Friday, it
indicated it expects fourth-quarter earnings to be "in excess
of $140 million." Chase said earlier that as a result of the
restructuring program, it expects to report a third-quarter
pretax loss of about $625 million.
   Moody's lowered its ratings on Chase Manhattan's senior
debt to Baa-3 from Baa-2, subordinated debt to Ba-2 from
Baa3; preferred stock to Ba-2 from Baa-3, and commercial
paper to prime-3 from prime2.

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush appeared to be losing support
from his top lieutenants in Congress for a cut in
capital-gains taxes, one of his priorities in the budget
talks.
   "There will be a price to be paid if we continue to insist
on it, and in my opinion the doggone price is too steep,"
House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois said before
the closed-door budget talks resumed last night.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earlier in the week, Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole
said he didn't want the capital-gains controversy to stand in
the way of a compromise with the Democrats. Democrats have
been demanding that income-tax rates on the rich be raised if
capital-gains tax rates are cut; the administration won't go
along.
   Meanwhile, the House Appropriations Committee took a step
toward delaying automatic spending cuts that would cripple
the federal government, and President Bush promptly pledged
to veto such a measure unless budget negotiators reach a
compromise first. "I do not want to see further delay in
kicking this problem on down the road," he told reporters.
   The stopgap spending bill would fund the government until
Oct. 20 and forestall budget cuts mandated by the
Gramm-Rudman law due to take effect Monday.
   Republicans will make an effort to strike the Gramm-Rudman
waiver on the floor and, mindful of the politics of seeming
to be weak on budget discipline, some leading Democrats are
themselves uncertain how to proceed.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
said last night that he might side with Republicans against
any delay in the Gramm-Rudman spending cuts in an effort to
keep both sides' "feet to the fire."
   The president's insistence on reducing capital-gains tax
rates remains a formidable obstacle to a budget accord,
although not the only one. People close to the talks say
Democratic and Republican negotiators have discussed narrower
alternatives to the Bush administration's proposal to lower
the tax on profits from the sale of almost all assets. "What
the Democrats are trying to do is provide a face-saving exit
for the administration," one congressional staffer said. At
least some Republicans are receptive, Rep. Michel among them.
   Among the options that have been discussed are:
restricting the lower tax rate to profits on new investments,
maintaining the current tax rates but taxing only profit in
excess of inflation and limiting the lower tax rate to
investments in start-up companies. House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) is said to be particularly
interested in the third option, which has long been advocated
by some other Democrats.
   Meanwhile, among rank and file members of Congress, who
are increasingly anxious about the budget stalemate, a new
controversy erupted yesterday when some House Democrats heard
that congressional pay would be targeted under one tentative
savings proposal.
   The idea was to balance a proposed delay in cost-of-living
adjustments for federal retirees with a similar delay in
congressional raises. But by day's end, the proposals for
both lawmakers and retirees had been scrapped, one top
leadership aide said.
   Although most attention is focused on the proposal to
delay the Gramm-Rudman cuts, there is pressure within the
White House to veto any spending bill even if the waiver
provision isn't included.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu told Senate
Republicans yesterday the option of a government shutdown was
being considered, and people close to Budget Director Richard
Darman said he might recommend a veto of any continuing
resolution without a budget agreement.
   That could bring major portions of the government to a
halt and heighten the confrontation. The administration could
gain some flexibility under precedents allowing it to retain
essential personnel, including much of the Pentagon and law
enforcement workers, who might be furloughed otherwise under
the Gramm-Rudman cuts. Ironically, the cuts themselves are
blunted in the absence of a resolution because there is no
spending authority from which to cut.
   The prolonged negotiations this year have contributed to
extraordinary delays in enactment of the required annual
spending bills. Congress has yet to give final approval to
any of the 13 appropriations measures for fiscal 1991, and a
$52.26 billion agriculture and rural development bill which
cleared the Senate late yesterday is only the fifth such
appropriations bill to pass the chamber for 1991.
   The 79-19 roll call on the farm bill came as the Senate
Appropriations Committee separately approved a nearly $78.6
billion measure funding science, housing, and veterans
programs for the new fiscal year and incorporating major
reductions in the administration's space program. Virtually
all new money for the Moon and Mars initiative is denied, and
the bill calls for a 35% or $863.6 million reduction from the
president's request for the space station in fiscal 1991.
   Total appropriations for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration would grow to $13.45 billion; but Sen.
Barbara Mikulski (D., Md.), who chairs the NASA subcommittee,
said the space station cut was "devastating" to the program.
   The CRAF-Cassini project, an ambitious follow-on to the
celebrated Voyager mission, is expected to lose one of its
two spacecraft under threatened cuts elsewhere in NASA's
budget. And the space reductions touch a set of political
interests from conservative Texas lawmakers to such academic
institutions as the University of Arizona, which has a stake
in the CRAF project to explore a comet and asteroid.
   Meanwhile, the House Appropriations Committee postponed
any action on President Bush's request to forgive Egypt's
military debts to the U.S. and, instead, approved a
three-month waiver of penalties if Cairo fails to meet
scheduled payments through December.
   The bipartisan leadership vowed to pursue some compromise
in the coming weeks.

   Heard on the Street:
   Is the Market Signaling Dividend Cut by Auto Makers?
   ----

DIVIDENDS (DIV)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- When stocks of the Big Three auto makers are
yielding just about as much as long-term government bonds,
the market is saying something.
   If you believe your broker at Montgomery Securities,
Kidder Peabody or a host of other firms, the message is that
-- with the possible exception of Chrysler -- there is
scarcely a better use for your life savings than to invest
them in auto stocks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ronald Glantz, auto analyst at Montgomery Securities,
says, "I call Ford and GM attractive entirely on the basis of
yield," the ratio of the dividend to the stock's market
price. General Motors stock is yielding 8.2%; Ford Motor,
9.1%, and Chrysler, 11.9%. These sound more like bond yields,
and, in fact, the yield on Ford's stock is within one
percentage point of the yield on its senior bonds.
   But as investors in Chase Manhattan stock learned last
week, a hefty yield isn't a guarantee of payment. And with
auto companies, too, one must ask whether dividends will
continue to be paid, or cut, as Chase's was. And to this
question, the market has an answer.
   "The market is telling you that the Big Three are likely
to trim dividends," Joseph Phillippi, a Shearson analyst,
says. In other words, if investors believed that dividends
were secure, they would pay more for the companies' stocks,
thus lowering yields.
   Most analysts still seem cautiously bullish that dividends
won't be cut. Yet PaineWebber, with no encouragement from the
auto makers but with its eye firmly on the looming recession,
already has published "estimates" of dividend cuts by the Big
Three in 1991.
   Thus, the prospect of recession has brought auto investors
to the same impasse faced by owners of high-yielding bank
stocks.
   Though the auto makers don't seem to be even contemplating
a cut -- Chairman Lee Iacocca has said Chrysler's payout will
be maintained, short of "nuclear war" -- investors are
increasingly worried.
   Markets aren't perfect, but on this point they have been
pretty good. According to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, whenever the
yield on auto stocks has been a bit more than twice the yield
of the S&amp;P 500 stock index, as it is now, the auto companies
have, soon after, cut their dividends.
   And if anyone has been punished of late, it has been those
who have reached for yield. High-yield junk bonds proved that
a high coupon does an investor little good when one's
principal is eroding. More recently, bank stocks, touted on
the basis of their attractive dividends, have been a
disaster.
   Auto companies, of course, haven't lent their capital to
Latin America or to real estate developers in New England.
The companies are safer than banks. Ford and GM are rated
double-A-minus, far above the below-investment-grade junk
bonds. Why then, all the worry?
   Two reasons. Many or most economists say a recession is
under way or about to be. And in virtually every postwar
recession, including the slumps in the mid-1970s and the
early 1980s, auto makers eliminated or reduced their payouts.
   Montgomery Securities' Mr. Glantz believes that the
dividends are sacrosanct, that "GM and Ford genuinely believe
that widows and orphans live off their dividend." One could
have had the same belief in 1982, when Ford and Chrysler both
eliminated their dividends.
   To invest now, one needs faith that auto makers will
weather this downturn better than they did the last one. And
if one is investing for yield, the key question is this: Will
the auto makers continue to earn as much as they are paying
out in dividends?
   Many analysts say Chrysler may not even be close to
earning its annual dividend of $1.20 a share next year. Ford
and GM, both paying $3 a share annually, should both earn
their dividends this year. But there are doubts about next
year.
   UBS's Jean-Claude Gruet, who is bullish on both GM and
Ford, predicts that GM will earn $3 a share next year and
Ford $3.70. In other words, GM would cover its dividend with
no margin for error, and Ford with only a slight margin.
   But Mr. Gruet's forecasts are based on the assumption that
the U.S. endures only a mild recession of six to nine months.
"If you have a severe recession," he says, "earnings go below
that."
   PaineWebber, which is bearish, sees GM earning $1.80 a
share and Ford $3.40 in a mild downturn in 1991. In a harsh
recession -- one lasting all of next year -- PaineWebber sees
GM in the red and Ford earning a scant $1.35 a share.
   Bulls make the point that companies may continue to pay
dividends even when they aren't "covered" by earnings. Ford
and GM could both borrow to pay dividends if earnings fell
short, and both might well do so for a year or even two. But
to count on that is speculative.
   According to a recent PaineWebber report, "Auto companies
cut the dividend not because of inadequate cash or other
financial necessity, but because of a combination of fear and
prudence."
   In a recession of more than six months, the report says,
dividend cuts would "appear likely . . ., even though cash
balances should be adequate to support both capital spending
and dividends."
   Depending on the level of car and light-truck sales for
the rest of the year, unit sales in the U.S. will have fallen
10% to 15% from 1986. In the early '80s industry collapse,
they fell about one-third.
   Were such a slide to be repeated, profit margins most
likely would fall even further. "When things get bad, cash
can run off at alarming rates," Mr. Phillippi of Shearson
says.
   Bulls make a cogent case that auto companies are healthier
than they were during the last slump. They argue that
earnings from sales in Europe and from light trucks in the
U.S., as well as profits from their captive finance
subsidiaries, have reduced the companies' exposure to an auto
slump in North America.
   Also, bulls note, auto sales have been falling since 1987;
there is hope, at least, that the auto cycle is near its
bottom, even if a nationwide recession may be only just
beginning. And, they say, consumers who bought cars in 1985
and 1986 -- banner years -- are ready for new ones.
   "What makes this time different?" Mr. Gruet of UBS says.
"The companies are stronger {financially} than in the past
and more diversified."
   But the earnings of the auto makers' finance companies are
linked to auto sales. And what if a recession, as some
forecast, were to hit Europe, too? Indeed, Japanese auto
makers are expected to increase market share in Europe, no
matter how the economy fares.
   The auto companies also have problems that go beyond the
looming recession. Ford, in the midst of an intense capital
spending program, is projected by analysts to have negative
cash flow next year. And GM is hurting from a long-term slide
in its market share.
   "The concern we have isn't so much a cyclical downturn,"
Scott Sprinzen of Standard &amp; Poor's says. For Ford and GM,
it's the loss of market share "due to imports and
transplants, and the concern that these trends could occur in
Europe," he says.
   Finally, there is the specter of higher oil prices. No one
knows whether oil prices will stay at current levels, but as
long as they do, Mr. Phillippi says, "It could have a hell of
an impact on consumers."

   Pirelli S.p.A. said consolidated profit fell 9.9% to 137
billion lire ($117.6 million) in the first half from 152
billion lire in the 1989 period.
   The key holding company of the Italian tires and cables
group predicted a similar decline in earnings for all of 1990
compared with the 320 billion lire earned in 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pirelli blamed the earnings drop in the year's opening
half on the 61% decline in profit at its Netherlands tire
division, Pirelli Tyre Holding N.V.
   Consolidated revenue was flat at 5.272 trillion lire,
while gross earnings edged down to 280 billion lire from 285
billion lire.
   Pirelli said that barring a "further deterioration of the
international situation" it expects 1990 revenue to be little
changed from last year's 10.342 trillion lire.
   The company didn't make any reference to its hostile bid
last week for Continental AG of West Germany. Continental on
Monday rejected Pirelli's offer to merge its tire division
with Continental and take control of the West German tire
maker.
   Pirelli hasn't commented on Continental's decision not to
accept the offer.

   The business information company, in a lawsuit filed in
U.S. District Court in Chicago, charges that International
Business Lists Inc., Inter-Direct Inc. and Gary E. Walter
improperly copied a database of U.S. businesses and their
executives compiled by D&amp;B and sold it to their customers.

   The suit also charges that Mr. Walter breached an
agreement not to compete with D&amp;B for two years after he left
the company. The suit says Mr. Walter left D&amp;B around Sept.

   D&amp;B's lawsuit seeks to stop the defendants from marketing
the data, and it asks for unspecified damages. Mr. Walter,
president of International Business Lists, called D&amp;B's
charges "absolutely untrue." Inter-Direct is the former name

   SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Public Utilities
Commission disallowed $48.3 million of expenses incurred by
Southern California Edison Co. from 1985 through 1987 under a
power-purchase contract with the Kern River Cogeneration Co.
   Southern California Edison, a unit of SCEcorp in Rosemead,
Calif., "negotiated a contract that was too favorable to Kern
River Cogeneration and much less favorable" to Edison's
customers, said Commissioner Stanley Hulett. Kern River
Cogeneration is 50%-owned by an SCEcorp affiliate and 50% by
a Texaco Inc. affiliate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Edison said it would appeal the decision, which it called
"extremely unfair and totally unjustified." Edison said it
presented testimony to the commission last year showing that
the contract is more beneficial to Edison's customers than
purchases mandated under standard contracts authorized by the
commission.
   Edison said it was pleased that the commission "recognized
(the company) has not engaged in self-dealing with its
non-utility affiliate as claimed by the Division of Ratepayer
Advocates," an independent arm of the commission that
represents consumers.
   The commission ordered SCEcorp to limit future
transactions with its affiliates to "standard contracts," or
to seek prior approval of any non-standard contracts.

   The French energy group Total-Cie. Francaise des Petroles
(CFP) reported that its consolidated profit for the first
half of 1990 fell 33% to 1.27 billion francs ($244 million)
on an attributable basis, compared with 1.91 billion francs a
year earlier.
   Total-CFP noted, however, that the latest results were
largely influenced by regular accounting adjustments in the
value of its petroleum inventories, which lopped 1.4 billion
francs off its earnings in the first half after having added
1.7 billion francs a year earlier. These latest adjustments,
which reflect changes in the market price of oil, are
expected to be offset during the second half of the year by
price rises tied to the Persian Gulf crisis.

   Total said its first-half consolidated revenue was 53.13
billion francs, up from 51.13 billion a year earlier.

   Portland General Corp. said it established an employee
stock ownership plan that will buy about $36 million of the
electric utility and energy holding company's common stock on
the open market over the next six months.
   The Portland, Ore., company's electric utility subsidiary,
Portland General Electric Co., will lend the money to the
ESOP to buy the shares. Funding for that loan will come
through either a private placement or public offering of debt
by the utility unit. Salomon Brothers Inc. is acting as
financial adviser. The ESOP will hold about 2.25 million of
the parent company's 46.3 million common shares outstanding,
Portland General said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This plan enables us to offer our employees a benefit
package that is competitive within our industry," Ken
Harrison, chief executive officer, said. "Since an ESOP
generally promotes stock ownership among employees, this
gives employees of all Portland General's companies a
longterm stake in the corporation's success and allows them
to participate in its growth and profits."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Portland General shares closed at $15.625, up 12.5 cents.

   Stride Rite's Keds division posted a 24% sales increase in
the quarter, partly because of increased shipments of women's

growth of Keds basic canvas products, the company said.
   Third-quarter sales at Stride Rite's Children's Group rose
5% from last year's quarter, while Sperry Top-Sider sales
posted a 7% increase.

sayeth the Lord thy God. Remember the Sabath (sic) and keep
it holy. Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
   The count of intentionally interfering with a
communications satellite, a felony, carries a maximum
sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

   UPS and Yamato
   Form Joint Venture

   GREENWICH, Conn. -- United Parcel Service of America Inc.
and Yamato Transport Co. of Japan, eager for a bigger share
of the booming air cargo trade between the U.S. and Japan,
have formed a joint venture.
   Closely held UPS, the world's largest package delivery
company, and Yamato, Japan's largest, named the venture
Unistar Air Cargo. A UPS official confirmed that the new
venture would be capitalized at more than one billion yen ($7
million), but wouldn't disclose the exact figures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   UPS and Yamato have been cooperating on small package
delivery services since 1986, and UPS officials said the new
venture expands current ties. Unistar allows the two
companies to provide door-to-door package service from
anywhere in the two countries. Analysts called the combinaton
logical, as UPS gears up to start direct air cargo flights to
Japan sometime after October. "UPS continues to chip away, to
expand a little bit at a time," says David M. Guthrie, an
analyst at Morgan Keegan in Memphis. "They should be a strong
competitor."
   Unistar will have its U.S. headquarters in Chicago, with
branches in New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco and
Anchorage, Alaska. In Japan, its operations will be based in
Tokyo. Officials said they plan to add 15 American branches
in early 1991.
   Analysts said since UPS's ties with Yamato are widely
known in the industry, it would not substantially alter the
existing competitve mix. Nonetheless, the intensely
competitive international air cargo market, which generates
$8 billion a year, is not expected to cool down anytime soon.
And Japan is the fastest-growing area.
   Currently, Federal Express Corp. is the only all-cargo
carrier offering scheduled services to Japan. But UPS, which
won the right to fly five times a week to Tokyo through
negotiations between the U.S. and Japanese governments last
November, will start competing soon with Federal Express for
air freight forwarding business.
   And in May, Japan Air Lines, West Germany's Lufthansa
airline and the Japanese trading company, Nissho Iwai Corp,
joined the fray when they bought a stake in DHL Worldwide
Express.
   UPS, which had revenue of more than $12 billion in 1989,
delivered more than 2.8 billion packages and documents in all
50 U.S. states and in more than 180 countries. Yamato, one of
Japan's oldest transportation companies, had revenue of $2.4
billion in 1989.

   Aluminum Co. of America, Pittsburgh, disclosed details of

aluminum can stock, and said the companies will explore

   Alcoa and Kobe will make an initial equity investment of
10 billion yen ($72.8 million) in a new plant in Japan to
produce and market aluminum can stock, mainly for the
Japanese and Asian beverage container markets; the total
investment, including debt, wasn't disclosed. The 50-50
venture, KSL Alcoa Aluminum Co., is to begin production in
1993, with annual capacity of 180,000 metric tons; each ton
is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. The companies also will
study forming a venture to produce aluminum products for the
automotive industry in Japan or the U.S. or both, and explore
technical exchanges in areas such as recycling.
</LP>

   For Alcoa, the region offers growth, as only 35% of cans
in Japan are made of aluminum, compared with 95% in the U.S.
Kobe, which imports aluminum ingot from various suppliers,
said it will get a stable supply from Alcoa.

   NEW YORK -- Encouraged by lower oil prices, investors
pushed U.S. government long-term bond prices higher
yesterday.
   Treasury bonds pulled out of their recent tailspin,
climbing about 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount.
As of late in the afternoon, the yield on the government's
benchmark 30-year bonds was 9.13%, down from 9.17% late
Monday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But corporate junk bonds didn't join in the rally. Prices
slumped again yesterday, partly reflecting growing fears that
the economy's weakness will trigger a big wave of defaults in
coming years on junk bonds, those high-yield, high-risk
issues that have low credit ratings or no rating at all.
   "The excesses of the junk bond market in the late 1980s
are now coming home to roost," said Richard Lehmann,
president of the Bond Investors Association of Miami Lakes,
Fla. Speaking at a conference in New York, Mr. Lehmann
predicted sharp increases in junk-bond defaults this year and
next. "We're basing this on a forecast of only a modest
recession," he added.
   Investors also remain concerned about some big banks'
securities. Traders say investors fear that Chase Manhattan
Corp.'s recent decision to cut its dividend as well as its
work force could be an early-warning signal of problems at
other large banks. Prices of both Chase and Citicorp bonds
fell yesterday.
   Despite yesterday's Treasury bond market rally, many
individual investors, worried by inflation fears and Middle
East tensions, are shunning long-term bonds and buying
shorter-term issues instead. That strategy is smart, numerous
investment managers say. They are especially bullish on
Treasury issues due in five years or less, and many recommend
the new two-year notes auctioned yesterday by the government
at an average annual yield of 8.18%.
   Buying short-term notes "makes a lot of sense, given all
the uncertainty in the Gulf and the eventual implications for
inflation because of what's happening to oil prices," said
Edward Treichel, investment strategist at Van Kampen Merritt
Investment Advisory Corp.
   Mr. Treichel contended that the two-year notes sold
yesterday, as well as new four-year notes to be sold today,
"clearly represent attractive alternatives for conservative
investors." The four-year notes today are expected to yield
about 8 1/2%.
   Bruce Whiteford, a vice president at Chase Manhattan's
U.S. private banking division, agreed that the two-year notes
look very attractive. "At confused times like this, people
don't like to take chances, and buying a two-year Treasury
note doesn't entail any credit risk and very little price
volatility," he said. The price of a two-year Treasury note
typically fluctuates "considerably less" in the secondary, or
resale, markets than prices of long-term bonds, he said.
   "This is a good way to get a high yield without trying to
guess where the market is going," Mr. Whiteford said. Also,
"it keeps your powder dry."
   However, buying short-term issues also means accepting
lower yields than are available on long-term bonds. For
example, 30-year Treasury bonds now yield about 9 1/8%, or
around one percentage point more than the two-year notes.
Several investment managers think long-term bonds offer
attractive values, especially because of mounting evidence
that the U.S. economy is weakening and because they think
inflation fears are greatly exaggerated.
   Even though the economy hardly grew at all in this year's
second quarter, the Federal Reserve shouldn't lower interest
rates now, said Fed board member Wayne Angell. He contended
yesterday that the Fed's "anti-inflationary resolve is being
tested," and thus that the central bank shouldn't ease
credit.
   Even if the Fed were to ease, "the average fellow
shouldn't rush out and buy long bonds" now, said James
Benham, chairman of Benham Capital Management Group, based in
Mountain View, Calif. He and several other money managers
said it isn't at all clear that a credit-easing move would
lead to higher bond prices because investors might interpret
such a move as a sign that the Fed had abandoned its
anti-inflation stance.
   Instead, investors should stick to notes due in about two
years to five years, Mr. Benham said. The two-year Treasury
notes sold yesterday represent "a good buy," he said. "You
enjoy a yield above 8%, you get your money back in two years,
and you don't subject yourself to the volatility invovlved
with long-term securities," he said.

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bond prices advanced yesterday.
   The Treasury's benchmark bonds, the 8 3/4 issue due in
August of 2020, rose nearly 1/2 point to a price of 96 3/32.
Their yield fell to 9.13% from Monday's close of 9.17%, which
was the highest on a comparable issue in at least a year and
a half.
   Short-term Treasury bill rates rose slightly. For example,
the latest three-month bills were quoted late in the day at a
discount rate of 7.37% and a bond-equivalent yield of 7.59%.
The bills were sold Monday at an average discount rate of
7.32% and a bond-equivalent yield of 7.56%.
   The Treasury's two-year note auction yesterday "went very
well overall," said James Capra, executive vice president at
Lehman Government Securities Inc. "Institutional buying was
very strong, and there was also good-sized buying by
individual" investors.
   The Treasury said yesterday that it received $2.06 billion
of "noncompetitive" bids for the new two-year notes. That is
a special bidding process typically used mainly by individual
investors and small institutions. But this time, the total
also included about $810 million of notes "awarded to Federal
Reserve banks as agents for foreign and international
monetary authorities," a Treasury spokesman said.
   Thus, about $1.25 billion of noncompetitive bids came from
the public, the Treasury said. That was down slightly from
about $1.37 billion in the August auction. Nonetheless, Mr.
Capra said this month's total "still is a large amount and
shows the desire for individuals to use short-term Treasurys
as a safe haven."
   Today, the Treasury will sell new four-year notes. Late
yesterday, the issue was trading in the when-issued market at
a yield of about 8.53%.
   Here are details of the Treasury's sale of two-year notes
yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   Corporate &amp; Junk Bonds

   Despite a late-afternoon rally, junk-bond prices finished
lower yesterday.
   Prices of bellwether corporate junk bonds ended the day
1/2 point lower.
   But prices rose on RJR Nabisco Inc.'s pay-in-kind bonds.
RJR's 17.375% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, due in
2009, finished 3/4 point higher at 110 3/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Traders attributed the climb in the RJR issues to firmer
stock prices and a ruling in a case against American Tobacco,
a unit of American Brands Inc. In that closely watched case,
jurors found in favor of the plaintiff but didn't award any
damages. Although RJR wasn't named as a defendant in the
case, traders cited the ruling as another important victory
for the tobacco industry.
   Meanwhile, in the investment-grade corporate debt market,
high-grade bonds ended unchanged to 1/4 point higher.
However, prices of bonds of two large banks, Citicorp and
Chase Manhattan Corp., continued to fall on worries that
recent problems at Chase could mean weakness for other big
banks. Chase Manhattan's 9.75% subordinated notes, maturing
in 1999, dropped one point to 72 1/2 for yield of 14.50%,
traders said.
   Citicorp's 9.75% subordinated capital notes, due in 1999,
fell 1/2 point to 89 1/4 for a yield of 11.75%. Also losing
ground were Citicorp issues with shorter maturities.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bond investors were pulled from the sidelines by
yields exceeding 8%, providing a warm market reception for an
issue of $250 million Washington Public Power Supply System's
Nuclear Project No. 1 revenue refunding bonds.
   The issue, priced by a Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. group, yields
from 6.60% in 1992 to 8.04% in 2017.
   The tax-exempt bonds ended unchanged to about 3/8 point
higher in moderately active trading.
   Also brought to market, through competitive bidding, was
$120 million of Clark County, Nev., school improvement
limited tax revenue bonds, via a group led by First Boston

   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue due 2018 was unchanged at 95 3/4 to

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities were unchanged to

   In the secondary market, Government National Mortgage

   Inflation fears drove Japanese government bond yields
higher.
   But trading activity was light, and dealers said prices
hovered in a narrow band most of the day. The yield on
Japan's benchmark bonds due 1999 rose to 8.675%, up .065
percentage point, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   In London, prices of U.K. bonds were little changed to
slightly lower in what dealers described as very quiet
trading. Britain's 12% bonds due 1995 declined 1/8 point to
99 24/32 to yield 12.04%. The 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007
dipped 1/32 point, also to 99 24/32, to yield 11.77%.
   French Treasury bond prices rose following Monday's large
setback. France's 8 1/2% issue due 2000 rose 0.41 to 87.31 to

   WASHINGTON -- Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. agreed to pay
a $220,000 fine to settle an administrative complaint by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its role in helping
a Brazilian investor violate position limits in orange-juice
futures.
   The agency said that from October 1987 to June of the next
year, Horst Happel of Sao Paolo, Brazil, an individual trader
and general manager of a Brazilian frozen concentrated
orange-juice processor allegedly traded through accounts at
Shearson. Shearson and account executive Charles Barley,
Windermere, Fla., allegedly aided and abetted Mr. Happel's
actions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Shearson also was charged with failing to disclose
information in reports, failing to update those reports, and
filing innaccurate reports to the CFTC. Shearson agreed to
settle the charges without admitting or denying them.
   Shearson called the CFTC allegations "highly technical in
nature," involving "no customer losses and related to
activity at only one of our branches several years ago." The
brokerage firm is a subsidiary of American Express Co., New
York.
   Mr. Barley also agreed to settle the charges without
admission or denial, will be suspended for 30 days and must
pay a $35,000 fine. Mr. Barley's manager, Gerald Helmich,
Longwood, Fla., without admitting or denying wrongdoing,
agreed to CFTC charges of failing to supervise and won't be
allowed to supervise any brokers for 14 days.
   Mr. Happel hasn't settled the agency's charges. His
lawyer, Howard Schneider, said Mr. Happel "doesn't think that
the CFTC is correct and he intends to vigorously defend
himself."
   The CFTC said that Mr. Happel, through his account and
others he controlled, held far more than the maximum number
of 800 juice contracts on the Citrus Associates of the New
York Cotton Exchange for 166 days during the October to June
period. Each contract is equal to 15,000 pounds of solid
frozen juice. On some of those days, Mr. Happel's positions
exceeded the limit by 1,142 contracts, the CFTC said.
   "Shearson knew they were all his accounts and as a member
firm should have known what the limits were," said Dennis
Klejna, the agency's enforcement director. "The positions
should have been aggregated."

   STAMFORD, Conn. - Erbamont Inc., the U.S. affiliate of
Erbamont NV, said that Italian authorities have seized
chemotherapy production facilities of its rival Sicor S.p.a.,
the Italian supplier to Cetus Corp.
   Both Erbamont and Sicor make and sell a chemotherapy drug
doxorubicin. Erbamont sells the drug under the brand name
Adriamycin through its affiliate Adria laboratories.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sicor has been the target of an investigation into alleged
theft of trade secrets and materials from Erbamont's Italian
affiliate, Farmitalia Carlo Erba S.r.l. of Milan.
   Separately, Erbamont has charged Cetus with infringement
of its rights under a process patent for making doxorubicin.
Cetus has denied the charge, and an administrative law judge
for the International Trade commission last May ruled in
favor of Cetus. Erbamont appealed the decision and brought
several federal court suits over related patent disputes.
   Cetus, a biotechnology company based in Emeryville,
Calif., said impact of the action on its generic chemotherapy
drug business is uncertain. A spokeswoman added Cetus hasn't
seen any official documents about the seizure, noting that
Sicor has denied the charges.
   "Sicor currently is our sole source of bulk doxorubicin,
so unless it can open up {the plant}, or we find an alternate
supplier, it will have a substantial effect on our generic
business in the future," the spokeswoman said.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Cetus closed $7.625,
up 62.5 cents.

   BOSTON -- A move by Massachusetts to build investor
confidence in its approaching bond issue received an
unsympathetic response yesterday from Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   S&amp;P rated the state's coming $1.04 billion bond issue
triple-B and placed the issue on the rating concern's
CreditWatch surveillance list, joining the triple-B rating on
the state's $5 billion of general obligation bonds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last week, Massachusetts state officials said they will
set up an "irrevocable trust fund" for the new Series A bonds
that will receive sufficient personal income-tax receipts
each month. Another rating concern, Moody's Investors
Services Inc., swiftly responded by giving the new issue a
Baa-1 rating, slightly better than the worst-in-the-nation
rating of Baa on the state's general obligation bonds.
   In elaborating on its rating, S&amp;P said, "Continued
negative economic news and lower-than-projected July and
August receipts have resulted in two identified revenue
shortfalls totaling $464 million, some $310 million of which
was not identified until last Monday."
   An S&amp;P spokeswoman also said the rating was affected by
"risks of a potential budget imbalance" from the proposed
tax-rollback referendum by the Citizens for Limited Taxation.
The additional security provisions provided by the dedicated
trust fund, she said, "were not viewed as sufficient
enhancement to raise ratings, given the history of fiscal
stress and the current budget environment."

   Gentex Corp. of Zeeland, Mich., and Donnelly Corp. of
Holland, Mich., said they agreed in principle to resolve a
patent dispute about an automatically dimming rearview
mirror.
   On May 10, Gentex sued Donnelly, claiming it infringed
upon the patent for the mirror sold by Gentex, and Donnelly
also filed suit, seeking a judgment that Donnelly's mirror
system didn't infringe upon Gentex's U.S. patent. In the
first half, Gentex sold 137,000 of the mirrors, which
automatically dim to eliminate headlight glare, up from
93,000 a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the agreement, Gentex would become a 50% shareholder
of Donnelly's Irish unit and Donnelly would receive newly
issued Gentex common shares to equal about a 12% stake, and
Donnelly would retain operating control of the unit. The
accord also would give Donnelly the right to buy additional
Gentex shares in the market to lift its stake 35%. If these
shares can't be acquired in the market, Donnelly would have
to option to buy enough shares from Gentex, at $11.625 each,
to reach a holding of about 30%.

   U.S. Rules Imports
   Of Argentine Leather
   Are Subject to Duties

   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department, reversing an
earlier determination, ruled that imports of Argentine
leather are unfairly subsidized and thus subject to
countervailing duties.
   The department said the Argentine government's prohibition
of exports of cattle hide is tantamount to a subsidy for
Argentine leather producers because the ban assures those
producers of lower hide prices than what their U.S.
competitors have to pay. This ruling supersedes an earlier
finding that Argentina didn't unfairly support its leather
producers in other ways.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling authorizes the U.S. Customs Service to collect
countervailing duties of 8.02% and 24.16% on the value of
imports from Antonio Esposito S.A. and Ultrahide S.A.,
respectively. Duties of 14.97% are to be collected from other
Argentina suppliers. These duties are intended to offset the
allegedly unfair price advantage that these imports have over
comparable U.S. products. The department said the subsidy
rates represent the estimated differences between U.S. and
Argentine hide prices.
   The ruling covers many kinds of leather, including that
made out of sheep, swine, reptile and chamois skins. The
value of all these Argentine imports last year was $143.6
million, according to the Commerce Department.
   The department acted on a petition filed by eight U.S.
tanning companies.

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush urged world financial and
economic leaders to work to ensure the success of current
international trade talks, which he warned are behind
schedule and gravely threatened by the impasse over
agricultural subsidies.
   Shortly before Mr. Bush spoke, European Community farm
ministers in Brussels backed a new subsidy reform plan
proposed by EC Agriculture Commissioner Ray MacSharry. But
the plan is unacceptable to the U.S. and to other big
agricultural exporters, such as Australia, Chile and Canada.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Agricultural reform remains a major stumbling block," Mr.
Bush said in his speech, asserting that the dispute over farm
subsidies "threatens to bring down the rest of the round" of
trade talks.
   Speaking on the opening day of the annual meetings of the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund, Mr. Bush said the
current international trade talks are "the last train leaving
the station, and countries around the world must jump
aboard." He argued that a more open world trading system, the
goal of the talks, could be "the engine of economic growth
that carries us into the 21st century."
   The EC proposal would involve a cut of about 30% in
European farm subsidies from 1986 levels. The U.S. says that
such subsidies peaked that year, and the reform proposal
actually would amount to a cut of only 10% to 15% in the $120
billion the EC now spends each year on subsidizing its
agricultural sector.
   Italian Agriculture Minister Vito Saccomandi, who chaired
the regular monthly meeting of EC agriculture ministers, said
the proposed cuts were about as much as European farmers
would tolerate. But if the EC sticks to this position, it is
likely to undermine the talks.
   The international trade talks are aimed at reforming the
world's trade treaty, the General Agreements on Tarriffs and
Trade. The collapse of the negotiations "will inevitably
encourage increased protectionist pressure and political
stability," Mr. Bush warned in his gloomiest assessment to
date of the talks. "We must let farmers compete with farmers,
instead of farmers competing with the deep pockets of
government treasuries."
   The current international trade talks, which began four
years ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay, are scheduled to end in
Brussels in December. Negotiators are a long way from
reaching agreements on many contentious areas besides
agriculture.
   Dubbing the trade talks "one of the world's greatest
opportunities of the decade," Mr. Bush warned that much
remains to be done, and he stressed that there are less than
70 days left before the four-year talks are set to reach a
conclusion.
   The president also praised moves toward democracy and
market-oriented economies that have become apparent the past
year. But he said "a new challenge" has arisen that could
hinder this process: "Iraq's illegal and unprovoked
aggression against the sovereign state of Kuwait."
   This has imposed "a staggering burden" on economies in the
region and further afield, Mr. Bush said. But "initial
response" from the world community "has been impressive," he
added, alluding to the billions of dollars pledged by the
European Community, Japan, West Germany, Saudi Arabia, the
Kuwait government-in-exile and other nations.
   "To transform commitments into concrete contributions,"
Mr. Bush said, he was forming "a Gulf Crisis Financial
Coordination Group" to be chaired by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady.
   The president also maintained that the World Bank and IMF
are key to helping the world through the Persian Gulf crisis,
and he said Mr. Brady today would make further
recommendations for how the two agencies could help countries
damaged by the crisis. "The political leadership of the U.N.
must be matched by the economic leadership of the IMF and the
World Bank," he said.
   Such rousing rhetoric aside, some of the wealthiest
nations are more eager to use their wealth elsewhere. West
Germany is trying to lower U.S. expectations about how large
a share it will take of the estimated $14 billion bill for
assisting the so-called Persian Gulf frontline states --
primarily Egypt, Turkey and Jordan -- this year and next.
   Germany intends to contribute promptly, a senior West
German official said, but its contribution will be limited
because Bonn is already committed to paying $7.6 billion (12
billion marks) to move 600,000 East German-based Soviet
troops and dependents back to Russia. It would be unrealistic
for the U.S. to expect Bonn's Persian Gulf contribution to be
anywhere close to the pledged amount for relocating the
Soviet troops, this official said.
   A meeting of potential donors scheduled for today -- to be
chaired by Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford -- is
expected to try to set the shape and size of the aid package.
There are important differences between some of the donors --
the Saudis and Kuwaitis, in particular, apparently don't
favor giving aid to Jordan.

   Bond International Gold Inc. said it has sold forward
810,000 ounces of gold at an average price of $425 an ounce.
The gold mining company said the average length of the
futures contracts is one year.
   The sale will allow the Denver company to cut its debt in
half in two years, the company said, and will improve its
profitability. A spokesman declined to say whether the lower
debt will make the company profitable.

   For the second quarter, heavily indebted Bond
International Gold reported a net loss of $12.7 million, or

Ltd. bought 65% of Bond International Gold for $379 million
in November 1989 from Alan Bond of Australia.
   The company operates five gold mines in the U.S., Canada
and Chile.
   Bond International stock fell 25 cents yesterday to close
at $6.25 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.

paid for related investments and expenditures.
   U.S. Cellular, a Chicago-based cellular telephone systems
operator, said an independent committee of its board will

   LOS ANGELES -- A Carolco Pictures Inc. stockholder filed
suit against the company's board, charging that Carolco's
recently announced buy-back of 3.4 million common shares from
its chairman is a "breach of fiduciary duty and an abuse of
control."
   According to the complaint, filed by stockholder
Arthur-Magna Inc. in state court here, Carolco Chairman Mario
Kassar will make a profit of about $11.5 million on the sale
and still own 57% of Carolco's shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The action, technically filed on Carolco's behalf as a
derivative lawsuit, charged that the agreed upon purchase
price of $13 a share, to be paid to Mr. Kassar, is $5.75 a
share higher than the closing price of the shares on the New
York Stock Exchange Monday, when the buy-back was announced.
   The funds for the repurchase were "apparently derived"
from the sale of convertible preferred shares last June to
Canal Plus Productions and Pioneer LDCA for about $90
million, the complaint said.
   "Thus, defendants saddled the corporation with substantial
added liability through the issuance of the preferred stock,
which was utilized primarily to fund the inequitable stock
repurchase complained of herein," the complaint said.
   A Carolco spokesman at the entertainment concern's
headquarters in Los Angeles declined comment on the suit.

   NEW YORK -- Fred Stella, a former lawyer, pleaded guilty
to three felony counts in connection with an alleged
money-laundering scheme involving a former official of Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co.
   In federal court in Manhattan, Mr. Stella, 51 years old,
pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to obstruct justice
and two counts of obstructing justice. He was indicted in May
along his brother Joseph Stella, 46, formerly head of Bear
Stearns' stock-loan department, and two others. Joseph Stella
resigned from Bear Stearns in April. Bear Stearns, a unit of
Bear Stearns Cos., wasn't involved in the alleged wrongdoing.
</LP>

   The four defendants were accused of laundering $1.7
million in checks that allegedly reflected the proceeds of
embezzled securities from Bankers Trust Co. and fees from
stock-loan transactions that others sought to avoid paying
taxes on. Bankers Trust is a unit of Bankers Trust New York
Corp.
   Fred Stella, of Brooklyn, is scheduled to be sentenced
Dec. 5 by federal Judge Charles Haight. The other defendents
are to go on trial Oct. 5 before Judge Haight.
   In addition to Joseph and Fred Stella, the indictment
named Roger C. Capozzi Sr. and Joseph A. Pontarelli. The
indictment accused Mr. Capozzi of cashing checks for Fred
Stella through a Brooklyn clothing-embroidery business. Mr.
Pontarelli was accused of cashing checks for Mr. Stella
through a Manhattan liquor store and check-cashing business.

   If Michael Milken's attorneys get their way, the former
$550 million-a-year man will be sentenced to work with the
Los Angeles Police Department to help inner-city youth.
   The attorneys proposed that Mr. Milken develop educational
and vocational programs to "combat the problems of drugs,
crime, unemployment and illiteracy threatening to destroy the
lives of inner-city youth in Los Angeles."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposal was based on a letter sent to U.S. District
Judge Kimba Wood by Daryl F. Gates, chief of police of Los
Angeles. Mr. Gates said in his letter that he met Mr. Milken
only once, several years ago, but that he believes Mr. Milken
would be uniquely qualified to establish a "domestic peace
corps" to help underprivileged children.
   In their sentencing memo, Mr. Milken's lawyers promised
that he would work, at a minimum, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
daily, "and weekends {if the court desires.}"
   The memo noted that "Michael would not find this work
easy; nor would it be risk-free." Chief Gates proposed that
Mr. Milken work "not behind a comfortable corporate desk, but
in the communities targeted by the program."
   The government is expected to propose instead that Mr.
Milken serve a long prison term, and that its length be
dependent in part on his willingness to cooperate in the
government's continuing investigation of securities-related
crime.
   Mr. Milken's lawyers oppose any attempt to link the length
of the sentence to his cooperation, arguing that his plea
agreement made clear that he would cooperate only after his
sentencing.

   Timken to Upgrade
   Alloy Steel Plants
   At $170 Million Cost

   CANTON, Ohio -- Timken Co., a bearings and steel producer,
said it will invest $170 million to improve its Canton alloy
steel production plants.
   The project is part of a $1 billion capital spending
program that Timken launched last year. The company has
detailed projects accounting for about one-third of the
money, including $210 million for its alloy and specialty
steels plants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Timken said it will replace a bloom continuous caster at
its Harrison Steel plant here with new casting equipment.
Also, it will improve the small bar rolling mill and bar
finishing operations at the plant. Investment in the Harrison
facility, which makes alloy steels, including some used in
Timken's bearings, will total $110 million, Timken said.
   The company said it will spend $32 million at the adjacent
five-year-old Faircrest Steel Plant to improve productivity
and product quality. And it will spend $28 million to upgrade
computer systems that serve both facilities.
   Rust International Corp. was named project manager for the
work, Timken said. Completion dates for the improvements
range from mid-1992 through mid-1993.
   Those programs, along with a previously announced $40
million investment at Timken's Latrobe specialty steel unit,
make up the bulk of the planned spending for steel plant
improvements, Timken said. When completed, they will make
Timken competitive globally in alloy and specialty steels,
both in quality and cost, the company said.
   The largest part of Timken's $1 billion investment will be
for bearings plants, but the major bearings projects haven't
been announced. The company has announced plans for building
a $23 million bearings plant in Altavista, Va., and an
investment of $13 million to modernize production of large
bearings.

   Senate Clears Bill
   Broadening SEC
   Regulatory Power

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
CONGRESS (CNG)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed a compromise bill that
broadens the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to
gather Wall Street information and for the first time sets
guidelines for how the agency can curb forms of program
trading.
   The measure, passed by voice vote, is the first
Senate-approved legislation to include provisions about
program trading, in which computers help trade baskets of
stocks and futures on those stocks. The bill, which is
expected to breeze through the House in the next few days and
be signed by President Bush, also gives the SEC the clout to
close down the stock market in periods of extreme stress,
provided the president doesn't oppose such a move. Currently
only the president can order such a closure.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Much of the SEC-sponsored bill is direct fallout from the
1987 crash. The bill was first proposed by the SEC under
Chairman David Ruder in 1988 but progressed slowly after
being introduced in March 1989. It then was jump-started by
the market drop in October 1989 and Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.'s collapse earlier this year, and reflects reactions to
those drops and the Drexel bankrupcty filing.
   One section of the bill, for example, would allow the SEC
to set up record-keeping procedures for large securities
transactions. After the 1987 crash, the SEC complained that
it didn't have sufficient information to determine risks to
the overall financial system.
   The bill also would allow the federal regulators to
strengthen the clearance and settlement system for stocks,
options and futures, again in an effort to reduce risks to
the financial markets.
   A third section would give the SEC the power to ask
brokerage firm holding companies for financial information.
The SEC has said that before the Drexel collapse, it didn't
have enough to determine data that the brokerage firm's
holding company was having liquidity problems.
   "This measure helps regain the {public's} trust by
providing regulators the tools they need to ensure the
continued integrity of our capital markets," said sponsor
Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), who heads the securities
subcommittee.
   But the most intriguing section of the legislation focuses
on program trading. The measure originally was introduced in
the House by Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), who pushed the
provision through that body largely by narrowing the language
to meet concerns of other members. There was no
program-trading provision in the version of the bill the
Senate approved last month.
   Although the bill approved yesterday never mentions the
words program trading, it allows the SEC to prohibit "during
periods of extraordinary market volatility" any trading
practice that the commission has found "previously
contributed significantly to extraordinary levels of
volatility." The SEC must determine that the practice could
contribute to that type of volatility in the future. Another
section lets the agency "prescribe means reasonably designed
to prevent manipulation" of stocks or the market.
   But the measure doesn't define any of its terms about
volatility, providing the commission leeway to determine how
to enforce the provision.
   Senate staffers played down the significance of the
program-trading measure. "I think 99.99% of all program
trading will never be affected by this bill," said a Senate
securities subcommittee aide.
   But the House report on the bill said that it would allow
the agency to adopt rules similar to the one recently
inaugurated by the New York Stock Exchange on a trial basis.
That rule, which sharply limits a common form of program
trading when the Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved 50
points or more, has kicked in several times over the past
month.

   Chemical Waste Gets
   $3.75 Million Fine

   CHICAGO -- Chemical Waste Management Inc. agreed to pay a
$3.75 million fine for pollution violations at a toxic-waste
incinerator.
   Under the agreement with the Environmental Protection
Agency, Chemical Waste admitted no wrongdoing, but dropped
its earlier opposition to the fine. The company is 77%-owned
by Waste Management Inc. of Oak Brook, Ill.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The EPA charged that Chemical Waste's incinerator on
Chicago's South Side didn't properly monitor emissions when
burning toxic polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, and didn't
stop burning the compound when the pollution-monitoring
system failed. The agency additionally cited the company for
other, related violations of the Toxic Substances Control
Act, including improper record keeping.
   The problems became known after a former company employee,
who had been terminated for unrelated reasons, informed
Chemical Waste officials in 1987 that he and others had
deliberately disconnected the monitoring devices. Such a move
would permit concealment of overloading at the incinerator.
Chemical Waste subsequently fired two managers at the
incinerator and notified the EPA of the problem.
   In the agreement, the EPA reduced the penalty from an
proposed $4.3 million, partly in consideration of Chemical
Waste's reporting to the agency. The lowered fine also
reflects $353,000 in penalties Chemical Waste paid to state
pollution authorities for the same violations, the EPA said,
as well as the company's "current compliance with Federal
regulations and substantial improvements in its monitoring
operations."
   A Chemical Waste spokesman stressed that the "alleged
violations" occurred in 1986 and 1987, and "resulted in no
threat to {public} health or the environment."

   FORT WORTH, Texas -- Six days after their $18-a-share
offer for all of Justin Industries Inc. was rejected by the
board, a group of dissident shareholders launched a tender
offer featuring similar terms.
   The bid came only hours after a federal judge in Fort
Worth denied a motion seeking to force Justin to hold a
special shareholders' meeting. The judge also refused to halt
or delay Justin's planned acquisition of Tony Lama Co. for $9
a share, or $18 million, plus the assumption of about $34
million in debt. The dissidents said they would appeal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a prepared response, the company said it would take a
position on the tender offer on or before Oct. 9, and it
asked shareholders not to make a decision until then.
   The dissidents, led by Perry H. Sutherland of Kansas City,
Mo., and Barry S. Rosenstein of New York, said they are
offering to buy about 6.2 million shares of Justin common for
$18 apiece, or about $111 million. That, combined with the
nearly 12% stake they already own, would give them a 78%
stake.
   If the offer is completed, the dissidents said they will
merge Justin into a newly formed entity -- JTN Acquisition
Corp.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Justin shares closed
at $15, up $1.25.
   The dissidents said their offer is contingent on the
receipt of tenders from holders representing enough Justin
common to boost the stake of the buyers to 66.7% on a fully
diluted basis. They said the offer, which expires Oct. 23, is
also contingent on their obtaining sufficient financing.
   This represents the group's third proposal this year to
buy Justin, a maker of Western boots, bricks and building
materials. The board rejected the two previous offers.

   Also exciting the market was a report in this newspaper
yesterday that Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan is
in talks with MCA Inc. regarding a possible acquisition for
$80 to $90 a share, or about $6.7 billion to $7.5 billion.
   MCA confirmed that it was talking to a "major
international company"; a Dow Jones News Service story later
said an anonymous "senior official at Matsushita Electric"
confirmed the talks of a possible buy-out.
   MCA's shares rocketed 19 1/2 to 54, with 3.7 million
shares trading, making it the most active Big Board issue and
the largest gainer on the exchange yesterday. Shares of other
entertainment companies jumped on the news: Paramount
Communications rose 3 1/4 to 34 7/8; Time Warner gained 1 1/4
to 70 7/8, and Walt Disney rose 1 5/8 to 90 1/8.
   Despite the gains, some traders and investors said they
thought the rebound would be short-lived.
   "This is a market with absolutely no conviction," said
Edward Shopkorn, general partner at Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. "The
economic numbers say we are going into a recession. Equities
are overvalued relative to the economic outlook around the
world." In the final revision of second-quarter gross
national product growth released yesterday, the government
said that the economy crawled ahead at a 0.4% annual rate,
compared with the previous estimate of 1.2%. Mr. Shopkorn
said the market's bounce was mainly due to professionals
buying back positions they had sold "short" earlier, and to
money managers "nibbling" at stocks.
   Money managers are also keeping a close eye on Federal
Reserve policy and budget negotiations. Graham Tanaka,
president of Tanaka Capital Management, a growth stock
manager, said recent reports that asserted the Federal
Reserve wouldn't immediately ease interest rates helped
growth stocks, which were among the most active issues
yesterday. PepsiCo rebounded 3/8 to 22 on 1.7 million shares,
for example.
   Mr. Tanaka said the Fed's inflation-fighting stance is a
positive for growth stocks because future earnings appear
protected from escalating inflation. Still, Mr. Tanaka said,
the stock market is vulnerable to a weak budget accord that
doesn't seriously control federal spending.
   "We are sweating it out because of our concerns that
Congress is dropping the ball on fiscal policy," said Mr.
Tanaka.
   Major oil companies sat out yesterday's rally.
   Mobil fell 1 to 65 7/8 and Sun Co. was off 1/2 to 32.
Phillips Petroleum stumbled 7/8 to 28. Amoco declined 1/2 to
58. Unocal lost 1/4 to 33 1/4 and Atlantic Richfield dropped
1 1/8 to 138 7/8. Only Exxon avoided the decline, finishing
unchanged at 50 1/2.
   Battered recently by the anticipated effects of higher oil
prices, major airline issues finished with gains. AMR climbed
1 3/4 to 41 3/4. Delta rose 1 1/4 to 54 1/8 and USAir Group
was 1 3/8 higher at 16 1/2. The Associated Press reported
that analysts expect higher oil prices to knock weaker
airlines out of the sky.
   UAL was the exception among airline stocks, dropping 3 1/4
to 89 amid more concerns about an employee buy-out effort.
   Chase Manhattan regained some of the ground it lost in the
wake of last week's dividend cut and cutback announcement.
Its shares closed 7/8 higher at 12.
   Other major international banks also finished higher.
Citicorp was up 1/4 to 15 1/2, Bankers Trust added 1/2 to 32
3/4 and Manufacturers Hanover gained 1/2 to 22 3/8.
   BankAmerica said it will join forces with Barclays Bank to
battle American Express for traveler's check supremacy.
BankAmerica closed 7/8 higher at 20 1/2. American Express
shares added 1 to close at 21 3/4.
   Mid-September car sale figures were released yesterday and
the market gave them mixed reviews. General Motors rose 3/8
to 36 1/2. Ford also gained, closing 1/4 higher to 33 1/8,
while Chrysler dropped 1/4 to 10 1/8. Both Shearson Lehman
Brothers and Goldman Sachs reiterated negative ratings on
Chrysler.
   American Brands announced a 2-for-1 stock split and a
boost in its quarterly dividend to 38.5 cents a share. The
new dividend rate is equivalent to 77 cents a share before
the split, when the rate was 68 cents. American Brands gained
1 3/4 to 68.
   Crane said it is considering spinning off its defense
businesses to shareholders. At $77.6 million, the defense
businesses represented about 5% of Crane's fiscal 1989 sales.
Crane was 1/2 higher at 19 1/4.
   Brush Wellman projected third-quarter earnings will be
significantly below the 22 cents a share it reported in the
quarter a year ago. Its shares fell 2 to 13 1/2.
   Reebok International said lower U.S. footwear sales will
depress third-quarter earnings. Reebok projected
third-quarter earnings at between 33 cents and 35 cents a
share, down from 44 cents a share a year ago. It sees
fourth-quarter earnings rising to the 30 cents a share it
earned in the fourth quarter last year. Reebok shares dropped
3/4 to 9 1/8.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.33
to 313.17. Volume totaled 12,940,000 shares.

   Rancher Wins Jury Award Against Hutton

   A South Dakota rancher, who said he was bilked by his
broker, won a jury award of $800,000 in punitive damages
against E.F. Hutton &amp; Co.
   The jury in the town of Rapid City concluded that Hutton
and a former Hutton broker took advantage of an inexperienced
investor, pursuing a risky investment strategy that cost the
plaintiff $27,000. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. is now part of Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition to the punitive damages, designed to punish
the defendant, the jury compensated rancher Wayne Stark for
his loss plus interest, amounting to $36,360.
   The case began in December 1983, when Mr. Stark decided to
invest the proceeds from a cattle sale. The 45-year-old
cattleman from Belle Fourche, a town in the Black Hills,
opened an account at a Hutton office in nearby Rapid City.
   According to Mr. Stark's attorney, Ronald Clabaugh of
Rapid City, Hutton used the money in a risky strategy known
as "naked" put writing. This meant that the broker, William
Van Drunen, sold options committing Mr. Stark to purchase
various securities at a fixed price in the future. When the
market fell in October 1987, Mr. Stark lost $27,000.
   According to Mr. Stark's 1989 lawsuit, Mr. Van Drunen was
trading in the rancher's account without his knowledge.
Furthermore, according to the suit, the broker was "churning"
the account -- generating excessive turnover in the account
to make money in commissions. Hutton, the suit claimed, had
failed to supervise its broker adequately.
   The trial began last week in Rapid City and lasted five
days. The jurors, all from Rapid City, deliberated less than
five hours to determine culpability.
   Donald Walford, a Denver investment banker who testified
as an expert witness for Mr. Stark, said, "He had no
knowledge of option trading. If you said stock to this guy,
he said horses or cattle. He had no idea he could lose, and
he lost a lot."
   Mr. Van Drunen, who was not named as a defendant in the
case, could not be located for comment. A Hutton attorney in
Chicago, Timothy Carey, said, "We intend to file a motion to
have the verdict set aside."

   LOCKHEED faces wrongful-dismissal case filed by three
company auditors.
   In the case set to begin today, Lockheed Corp. is accused
of firing the auditors in 1985 for questioning the structural
integrity of the giant C-5B military cargo plane. The C-5B is
being used a lot in the Persian Gulf because of its 145-ton
capacity.
   The auditors say they were fired because they raised
concerns about the C5B's metal mainframes, complaining all
the way up the chain of command to the then-president of
Lockheed, Lawrence Kitchen. The defense contractor maintains
that Thomas Benecke and Terrence Schielke were dismissed
after exhibiting "unprofessional conduct" and circumventing
"company policies and audit procedures." The third employee,
Clyde Jones Jr., "had elected to retire well before" Mr.
Kitchen learned of the matter, Lockheed says.
   The trial pits Lockheed against Herbert Hafif, an attorney
perhaps best known for suing ComputerLand Corp. over a
$250,000 promisory note and ending up winning 20% of the
company for his clients in a highly publicized jury award.
Mr. Hafif said in an interview he aims to show how the C-5B
is "a ticking time bomb," although he doesn't claim to be
able to prove any specific accidents occurred because of
mainframe problems.
   Lockheed says the company and the Air Force have studied
the possibility of mainframe deficiencies over the years --
including through task forces that the plaintiffs were
members of -- and they've determined "the parts had been
properly prepared and are safe."
   The case will focus in part on a letter the auditors sent
in August 1985 to Mr. Kitchen, which ended: "Our patience is
exhausted. We will not be delayed or stonewalled for any
reason. This issue deals with life and death, and this letter
represents our last resort in dealing with this problem
internally. The ball is in your court."
   Mr. Kitchen threw the missive back across the table to Mr.
Benecke. "I told him I didn't like their approach," Mr.
Kitchen said in a deposition. "I asked why they had not
followed the procedure of an audit report and taken it
through the proper process; why they hadn't carried out their
responsibilities that they had as auditors; and that I didn't
appreciate them coming in at the last hour."
   Mr. Jones said later that he never "dreamed that {Mr.
Kitchen} would get in that state of anger." But Mr. Kitchen,
who retired as Lockheed chairman in 1988 and is still a
director, described himself as perhaps "forceful in my
response, but nothing out of the ordinary."

   TOBACCO-LIABILITY verdict leaves both sides claiming
victory.
   By finding American Tobacco Co. liable for the death of a
longtime smoker -- but awarding no damages to his family -- a
jury in Oxford, Miss., has muddied the waters of tobacco
litigation.
   The family of Nathan H. Horton, a housing contractor who
died of lung cancer in 1987, charged American Tobacco with
marketing a "defective and unreasonably dangerous product."
The company, a unit of American Brands Inc., denied any
responsibility for Mr. Horton's death. But anti-smoking
forces saw Mississippi's state law, which is more favorable
to plaintiffs than most other states, as working to their
advantage.
   A Lafayette County circuit court jury, by a 9-3 vote,
found for the plaintiffs -- but went no further. Testimony
showed that Mr. Horton "continued to smoke in the face of
warnings from his family and doctors," said David Roach, jury
foreman, "and therefore, he assumed some of the risk and
fault."
   Mike Davis, an attorney with Byrd, Davis &amp; Eisenberg in
Austin, Texas, who helped represent the Hortons, termed the
outcome "unusual," but said it represents progress in the
"evolutionary process" of tobacco litigation. "Five years
ago, a verdict for a plaintiff was unheard of. Now public
opinion is beginning to evolve to the point where {physical
harm} is a matter of shared responsibility."
   Some tobacco industry analysts, however, seized on the
same point as evidence that cigarette makers scored a major
victory. "Even if you can prove" that smoking causes harm,
said Kurt Feuerman at Morgan Stanley, "it's difficult to
prove that the plaintiff wasn't aware of the risks. This
{verdict} won't snowball into a tremendous number of new
cases." American Tobacco declined to comment.
   Immediately following the verdict, attorneys for American
Brands asked Judge Eugene Bogen to enter a judgment for the
company, since no damages were due to the Hortons. Attorneys
for the Hortons, meanwhile, asked the judge to award at least
nominal damages or to set a new trial to determine damages.
Judge Bogen said he would consider both sides' requests.

   SCHOOL FINANCING LAW declared invalid by Texas judge.
   The law was adopted in June, eight months after the Texas
Supreme Court said the state's system of financing public
education was unconstitutional because of disparities in the
treatment of rich and poor school districts. Like most
states, the Texas system relies on a combination of state
funding and local property taxes.
   In response to the state supreme court ruling, Texas
lawmakers approved a five-year education plan that adds $528
million to state funding for public schools in 1990-91. But a
number of poorer school districts went back to court,
contending the new law doesn't cure the inequities. In
Austin, State District Judge F. Scott McCown agreed,
concluding that the system "remains unconstitutional."
   Judge McCown said the state's lawmakers had failed to
establish a system that provides wealthy and poor school
districts with "substantially equal" access to revenue. He
didn't order immediate changes, but told the Legislature to
come up with a better plan by next Sept. 1. If it doesn't,
the judge said he would consider barring the spending of
state and local funds earmarked for schools, or else telling
them how to spend the funds.
   W.N. Kirby, Texas commissioner of education, said he'll
ask the state to appeal the ruling, but he also urged the
Legislature to work on a new plan "or risk having the courts
lead our children down the road of mediocrity for all."

   FORMER THRIFT REGULATOR joins Washington law office.
   Rosemary Stewart, former director of enforcement for the
Office of Thrift Supervision, became a partner in the
220-lawyer Washington office of Cleveland-based Jones, Day,
Reavis &amp; Pogue.
   Ms. Stewart resigned her post at OTS in August. Prior to
the creation of OTS in 1989, Ms. Stewart was enforcement
chief at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. In that capacity,
she received some criticism for her role in drafting a 1988
memo of understanding with lawyers for Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan
Association, a unit of American Continental Corp., Phoenix.
   The memo, nicknamed "Rosemary's Baby" by thrift critics,
cleared Lincoln for the pre-1986 period in exchange for a
promise from Lincoln not to sue the bank board. But Ms.
Stewart says that the memo resulted in a 1988 Bank Board
examination that led to Lincoln being closed down. American
Continental Chairman Charles Keating Jr. unsuccessfully
challenged the Bank Board's actions in federal court. He is
now in jail awaiting trial on fraud charges brought by
California.
   Ms. Stewart said she will spend at least part of her time
working on thrift matters at Jones Day. Although there is a
federal prohibition against many former federal employees
representing clients before their former agency in their
first year out of government, it doesn't apply to Ms.
Stewart. She said she will begin representing clients before
OTS immediately.

   Seals May Not Clear Air on Green Claims

   A fledgling firm that grants a "green seal of approval"
for environmental advertising claims it finds worthy plans to
bless an array of recyclable products today. But consumer
confusion over such claims isn't likely to clear up any time
soon.
   At a news conference in Washington, D.C., Green Cross
Certification Co. will put its seal of approval on products
that include ones made by two nationally known companies:
Clorox, the consumer products maker, for the recycled content
of bleach boxes; and Ball Incon Glass Packaging, a big bottle
producer, for the recycled contents of its bottles and jars.
Later this fall, Green Cross is expected to certify
recyclable cans made by six leading U.S. steel manufacturers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Green Cross describes itself as a nonprofit division of
Scientific Certification Systems Inc., a closely held,
Oakland, Calif., food and product testing concern. Green
Cross charges manufacturers to verify environmental claims,
but only for the actual cost of the testing. It only tests
products submitted to it by the manufacturers. It issued its
first certification for a handful of smaller paper and
plastic companies last month. It claims the Green Seal
verifies that products meet a set standard, such as for
recycled content.
   Four West Coast grocery chains have begun promoting the
Green Cross program because they "don't want to be in the
position of having to judge (environmental) claims" or be
accused of misleading advertising, says Linda Brown, Green
Cross's vice president. The certification "will do a large
task in reducing the confusion."
   It's debatable, however, whether this environmental
labeling effort will enable many American consumers to assess
the proliferation of environmental advertisements that
promote products as friends of the earth.
   "People don't know what `environmentally friendly' means,"
says Lois Kaufman, president of Environmental Research
Associates, Princeton, N.J., pollsters on environmental
issues. "Just because one group tells them something (is
acceptable) won't necessarily clear up the confusion."
   Indeed, Ms. Kaufman adds, some manufacturers now are
hesitating "to jump on the environmental bandwagon for fear
it might backfire in their faces." These companies look
warily at the experience of Mobil Chemical Co., sued by seven
states last summer. The suits charged that Mobil exploited
popular misconceptions by making environmental claims for
Hefty trash bags that it knew were false. Mobil since has
settled with one state, Texas.
   Environmentalists say Mobil's alleged false advertising
has intensified public skepticism, persuading many people to
discount environmental claims entirely.
   Making matters worse, Green Cross isn't the only outfit
drafting national guidelines for environmental-safety
pitches.
   Green Seal Inc., a Washington group led by Earth Day
organizer Denis Hayes, intends to issue its own seals of
approval in early 1991 for items that reduce waste from
manufacture through disposal. The first five type of products
being tested are facial tissues, toilet paper, light bulbs,
house paint and laundry detergents.
   In the meantime, Green Seal is sparring with Green Cross
over its environmental purity. Green Seal takes issue with
its rival's certification today of the boxes in which Clorox
2 dry bleach is packed, for example. "What's the impact on
the environment of bleach?" asks Norman Dean, Green Seal's
executive director. "You have to examine the contents of a
package before you encourage people to buy it." Retorts a
Clorox spokesman: "Clorox 2 dry bleach does not contain any
ingredient shown to have a negative environmental impact."
   Manufacturers might reduce some consumer confusion over
environmental seals of approval by mounting major advertising
campaigns promoting the awards. Yet initial recipients of
Green Cross's seal are doing little to hawk it. Certified
products can carry a label containing the Green Cross seal
and an explanation, such as "made from at least 80% recycled
paper."
   Clorox, for instance, won't add the Green Cross to ads or
packaging for the bleach. The company simply will insert the
words: "Box made from recycled paper." Clorox isn't using the
symbol because "at this point, we're just seeing what we
have" before any decision is made on adding the Green Cross,
says Michael Reilly, Clorox manager of environmental
marketing.
   Similarly, Webster Industries won Green Cross's
endorsement last month for two brands of recycled plastic
trash bags, Good Sense and Renew. But the small Peabody,
Mass., company, dwarfed by competitors such as Mobil, plans
just one newspaper ad about the certification, due to appear
Oct. 17 in USA Today. "The next time you spend some green on
a trash bag, look for the Green Cross," the copy urges.
   Webster may run other advertising that features the Green
Cross label, says Claudia Berk, a senior vice president at
its ad agency, Backer Spielvogel Bates. "But at this point, I
am not sure what it will be."

   BBDO Lands Haagen-Dazs
                                                                                                       

   Haagen-Dazs, a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC, awarded the
$13 million account for its ice cream to BBDO, New York, a
unit of Omnicom Group.
   BBDO bested Chiat/Day/Mojo's New York office, the other
finalist. Yves E. Coleon, Haagen-Dazs's vice president of
marketing, said "it was a close call, but the creative
platform presented by BBDO seemed to offer the best long-term
potential for the brand."
   The ice cream maker put the account in review in July,
less than a year after it named Margeotes, Fertitta &amp; Weiss,
New York, to handle the account. Haagen-Dazs parted ways with
that shop because of a conflict with Godiva, another
Margeotes client that makes ice cream.
   When Margeotes won the business, billings were pegged at
$5 million. Mr. Coleon said yesterday that the jump in ad
spending reflects plans to advertise the brand much more
aggressively. He said its products have historically been
advertised mostly in print media, but the company is now
considering TV advertising. A new campaign is expected
shortly after the first of the year.

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC)
</GV>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- The three major television networks are
betting that Matshushita Electric Industrial Co.'s talks to
acquire one of Hollywood's most venerable studios, MCA Inc.,
could be the final event they need to win over Washington in
the push for deregulation.
   The disclosure of the Matsushita-MCA discussions comes
just as the Federal Communications Commission weighs whether
to ease regulations that block the NBC, ABC and CBS networks
from the $3-billion-a-year syndication market. Because the
major studios are heavily involved in syndicating reruns and
first-run shows to local stations, the FCC rules all but
eliminate the networks as potential bidders for any
production company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Network officials yesterday said that any FCC action to
lift the so-called Financial Interest and Syndication Rules
would likely come too late to let the networks bid for MCA
and its Universal television and film operations. But the
possible purchase of MCA already is being brandished by
network lobbyists who are arguing that the restrictions
should be lifted.
   The "fin-syn" rules have been left untouched for two
decades, but in the past year the networks have made major
progress in arguing for revisions -- in part by hammering the
steady encroachment on Hollywood by foreign rivals.
   "From a policy perspective," says NBC general counsel Rick
Cotton, the MCA talks "sure ought to be a final nail in the
coffin." He adds: "The apparent discussions between MCA and
Matsushita underline the imperative for Washington policy
makers to deal urgently with getting rid of the rules and
allowing the three U.S. networks to compete in the global
marketplace."
   The networks' major opponent in the fight over the rerun
rules, the Motion Picture Association of America, declined to
comment on the MCA discussions. But studio officials seem
likely to greet word of a Matsushita overture grimly.
   If Matsushita ultimately is able to buy MCA, three of the
eight major studios that comprise the association will be
foreign-owned. Sony Corp. acquired Columbia Pictures
Entertainment earlier this year. Australia's News Corp. owns
the Twentieth Century Fox film studio and the Fox network.
And Pathe Communications Corp., controlled by Italian
financier Giancarlo Parretti, is trying to complete its
acquisition of MGM/UA Communications Co.
   A Matsushita-MCA merger also would mean that over
one-third of the three networks' prime-time schedule will be
produced by foreign-owned companies, an NBC spokesman said.
   Senators and congressmen "became more willing to let the
FCC move" on lifting the rerun rules when Sony acquired
Columbia earlier this year, says George Vradenburg, general
counsel for CBS Inc. "If Matsushita acquires MCA, it will
reinforce the view that the regulations are totally out of
date in today's world-wide marketplace."
   Yesterday, Mr. Vradenburg got his first crack at
capitalizing on the MCA-Matsushita ties, as he, CBS President
Laurence A. Tisch and Mr. Tisch's key political operative,
Senior Vice President Jay Kriegel, met with FCC Commissioner
James Duggan to lobby for lifting the rerun rules. The MCA
disclosure "came up obliquely," Mr. Vradenburg says.
   Even FCC Chairman Alfred C. Sikes has pointed a finger at
the foreign incursions -- not because they should be
prohibited, but because the networks can't take the same
steps, given the rules that block them from the rerun market.
In a speech to a television trade group last week, Mr. Sikes
noted that federal law would bar NBC's owner, General
Electric Co., from acquiring a studio. "But we have no
special rules regarding the acquisition of a major studio by
a Japan-based electronics firm, such as Sony," the FCC
chairman said.
   Mr. Sikes has said that the FCC will hold a hearing this
fall to hear all sides of the rerun debate, and that the
commission hopes to issue a ruling in the first quarter of
next year.
   Whether Matsushita itself culminates its talks by
acquiring MCA, however, is another matter.
   Several takeover-stock traders put the odds at only 50-50
that Matsushita will buy MCA for a price of $80 to $90 a
share. That explains why MCA shares closed yesterday at only
$54 each, up $19.50. If Matsushita actually buys MCA,
shareholders could get an additional $30 a share. If no
transaction results, MCA shares would fall $15 to $20 each,
several traders said.
   But it seems unlikely that many U.S. companies have the
desire or the wherewithal to fund an acquisition in the $6
billion to $7 billion range that MCA and Matsushita are said
to be discussing. That is especially true given the rerun
regulations that rule out three well-heeled suitors: CBS,
NBC, and Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
   Other U.S. movie studios might run into antitrust problems
in buying MCA. In addition, financial players, such as
leveraged buy-out firms, would find it difficult to raise the
$8 billion or more in financing that a buy-out of MCA would
require. If a buyer of MCA paid more than $90 a share, the
deal would be nearly twice the size of the proposed buy-out
of UAL Corp., which has floundered for more than a year.
   "It would be hard to compete with a Japanese buyer as
large and as well-heeled as Matsushita," said one takeover
stock trader. "It's also hard to see somebody raising $8
billion in this market."
   But Jessica Reif, an analyst who follows MCA for First
Boston Corp., believes it is likely that MCA will be sold,
even if the talks with Matsushita break down. The
acknowledgment by MCA that it is talking about a friendly
acquisition "seems to put a `For Sale' sign up," Ms. Reif
says. "I put it at better than 50-50 that something could get
done."

   Motorola Cuts Prices
   On RISC Chips in Bid
   To Lift Market Share

   AUSTIN, Texas -- Motorola Inc.'s microprocessor products
group said it slashed prices on its reduction instruction set
computer (RISC) chips by as much as two-thirds, in a bid to
improve its share in that fast-growing market.
   RISC chips are speedy, streamlined microprocessors
currently used in workstations, but they have become so
inexpensive that personal-computer makers are about to adopt
them. They pose a threat to conventional PC microprocessors
built by Intel Corp., Santa Clara, Calif., and Motorola.
Those two companies' own RISC chips lag significantly in
sales behind those of Sun Microsystems Inc., Mountain View,
Calif., and MIPS Computer Systems Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.,
according to analysts. The market, however, is still young.
Motorola estimates that about 200,000 RISC chips were sold
last year, a small fraction of PC chip sales.
</LP>

   Motorola said it cut the price on its 16 megahertz 88100
chip to $49 from $148, and made cuts of similar magnitude on
chips that operated at speeds of 20 to 33 megahertz. The
prices apply to orders of 1,000 chips or more.
   "The 88000 family now sets a RISC price/performance
standard for the industry," said Jeff Nutt, marketing manager
for the 88000 family. "We believe these are the lowest-price
RISC chips for the computer market."
   But Andrew Allison, a consultant and editor of RISC
Management newsletter, Los Altos, Calif., said Sun and MIPS
are likely to keep their early leads.
   "This is in response to Motorola's negligible market
position," Mr. Allison said. "They haven't succeeded in
acquiring any volume customers for the product and time is
flashing by." He added that Motorola's new prices are "now in
the ballpark, but given their market position that isn't
enough."

   FAIRFAX, Va. -- Mobil Corp. said its vice chairman,
Richard Tucker, would retire May 1, 1991, but will leave the
post early to conduct a six-month study of factors currently
affecting the oil and gas industry.
   The retirement of the 63-year-old Mr. Tucker, who is also
president of the company's Mobil Oil Corp. unit, coincides
with the expiration of his three-year board term. No
successors have been named. The company said it would make
some staff realignments, effective Oct. 1, in line with the
start of the project by Mr. Tucker.

   Mobil said that previously, neither its chairman and chief
executive, Allen E. Murray, nor Mr. Tucker had the needed
time to meet with world and industry leaders to discuss
global changes affecting the company. An early leave, the
company said, "frees up" Mr. Tucker to study its changing
business environment. Mr. Tucker couldn't be reached for
comment.
   "In view of the turbulence and uncertainty facing our
industry, I felt this was the appropriate time to ask Mr.
Tucker to take on this study of the major changes that will
influence Mobil's future direction," Mr. Murray said in a
statement. He cited conflict in the Middle East, changes in
Eastern Europe, accelerating environmental concerns and
general economic uncertainty among those changes.
   Prior to being named to his present positions, Mr. Tucker
served as president of Mobil Diversified Businesses,
overseeing the operations of a number of businesses,
including Mobil Chemical, the company's mining and minerals
unit and the Montgomery Ward stores. Mobil sold the retail
chain in 1988.
   Mr. Murray, 61, retains the titles of chairman, chief
executive and president of Mobil Corp., and chairman and
chief executive of Mobil Oil Corp.

   MURRAY HILL, N.J. -- Airco Gases is adding a surcharge on
all delivered industrial-gas products, affecting as many as
10,000 customers.
   Airco, a U.S. unit of BOC Group of Britain, also expects
it will have to boost list prices on all industrial-gas
products between 6% and 10% before year's end. A spokeswoman
attributed the added charges to increases in oil prices and
their impact on distribution costs.

   Merchant liquid oxygen and nitrogen consumers will pay a
surcharge of three-quarters of one cent per 100 cubic feet
for large-tank deliveries and as much as two cents for
lower-volume customers. The charge on argon and hydrogen
supply will range from two to five cents per 100 cubic feet.

   AIRCO GASES said a recent surcharge on industrial gas
products will affect about 150,000 customers. A figure
provided by the company on the number of customers was
incorrect in last Wednesday's edition.
