   International:
   Japanese Employees
   May Not Be Quite
   So Loyal After All
   ---
   Survey by Dai-Ichi Discovers
   That Many New Recruits
   Expect to Change Jobs

   TOKYO -- It may be time to scrap the image of the loyal,
hard-working Japanese employee.
   Lifetime employment? At one of Japan's largest insurance
companies, Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co., only
two-thirds of new male recruits expect to finish their
careers there. Indeed, after only two months on the job,
nearly a third already have contemplated quitting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Truthful? Four in 10 new male workers at the insurance
company say they would lie to cover up the fact that they
overslept on a weekday. For most, the biggest change in their
lives resulting from their new jobs was having to get up
early.
   These tradition-shattering findings are contained in a
survey the company recently conducted of more than 300 new
recruits. The results were published in the employee
newsletter at Dai-Ichi, one of Japan's major employers with a
sales force of more than 60,000.
   Dai-Ichi has surveyed new employees before, but always
about themselves, a spokesman says. This was the first time
they were asked their views about working and the company.
   To some extent, the employees say, their answers reflect
changes in Japan. When young recruits start work, says Koji
Noda, a 22-year-old who joined Dai-Ichi in April, they
discovered "they have to do things they didn't or couldn't
see in the company's PR brochure."
   To be sure, many of the survey's findings confirm
stereotypes about office workers in Japan. For example, new
male employees at the insurance company are most interested
in automobiles, while new women recruits mostly want to
travel. The men would prefer to get married at age 30, the
women at 25.
   More surprising, perhaps, was the finding that workaholic
Japanese men aren't always as hard-working as their so-called
office lady counterparts. Only a third of the men said they
would stay at work if a boss asked them to put in overtime on
an evening when they had a date scheduled. Forty-one percent
of the women said they would labor for the company in those
circumstances.

   Many Stocks Can Offer Shelter
   In Mideast Storm, Analysts Say

   NEW YORK -- If the twin dangers of war and recession
dominate the market's outlook, are any stocks worth buying?
   Yes, according to Wall Street strategists, who say that
investors can try to immunize their portfolios with stocks
that should hold up reasonably well, or even rise, in the
current troubled market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among their favorites are oil and energy-related companies
that should benefit from higher oil prices and selected food,
tobacco and drug companies whose products should keep selling
even in an economic slump.
   Oil and oil-service stocks have risen sharply in the past
week as the rest of the market fell back. But stock
strategists are nearly unanimous in their belief that bigger
price gains will come as the world gets used to the idea of
paying well over $20 a barrel for crude oil.
   "The revaluation of oil stock prices is going to take a
while, to think about the effects of $25-a-barrel crude oil
vs. $15-a-barrel crude," says Edward Kerschner, chairman of
the investment policy committee at PaineWebber. "If oil
prices settle in the mid-20s per barrel, there's still
another 10% to 15% left in the oils and more than that in the
oil services," Mr. Kerschner says.
   Texaco, Amerada Hess, British Petroleum, Unocal and
Atlantic Richfield are Mr. Kerschner's favorites among the
oil companies; Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Smith
International and Rowan are his choices in the oil-services
group.
   "We think oil stocks are attractive on a longer-term
basis," says Michael Metz, chief market strategist at
Oppenheimer. "The developments in the Mideast indicate that
the secular direction of oil prices should be higher," Mr.
Metz says. Arco is Mr. Metz's pick among the oils; he adds
that Tosco, an oil refiner, has probably been beaten down too
far and might be attractive.
   There's less agreement about which stocks investors should
buy to prepare their portfolios for recession. But one theme
dominates: "defensive" stocks, or shares in companies whose
products will be among the last that consumers give up when
times get tough. These include food, drug and cigarette
makers plus electric and telephone utilities.
   "People will still need medicine and buy food," says Mr.
Metz, who recommends Albertson's, a well-regarded supermarket
chain, and Coca-Cola. Among drug manufacturers, Mr. Metz
favors Schering-Plough and Syntex.
   John Hoffmann, associate director of research at Smith
Barney, says that firm is largely sticking with the
recommendations it had in place before Iraqi tanks rolled
into Kuwait last week. He says Smith Barney had been
recommending that investors overweight their stock portfolios
in energy, putting 17% into energy companies compared with
the energy sector's 13% weighting in the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index.
   Among energy stocks, Mr. Hoffmann likes Texaco, Amerada
Hess, Amoco and Anadarko Petroleum, with Halliburton and
McDermott International as oil-service plays.
   Among the consumer-oriented stocks, Mr. Hoffmann suggests
Philip Morris plus drug stocks such as Baxter International,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Warner Lambert and SmithKline Beecham.
   As a defensive move, Smith Barney on Friday increased its
recommended weighting for utility stocks to match the group's
proportion in the S&amp;P 500. Mr. Hoffman suggests Pacific
Telesis and GTE among telephone companies and Commonwealth
Edison and PacifiCorp among electric utilities.
   But some strategists suggest avoiding utilities, despite
their reputation as classic defensive stocks. They worry that
long-term interest rates will remain stubbornly high this
time, even if the economy falls into recession. Utilities
tend to have heavy borrowing costs, so their stocks usually
fare poorly when interest rates are high.
   "We could have an unusual recession where longer-term
rates are going to be slow to go down," says Mr. Kerschner of
PaineWebber.
   Instead of utilities, Mr. Kerschner prefers as defensive
buys companies with a large percentage of their sales abroad,
figuring their earnings will benefit from a weak dollar. As
examples, he cites Merck, a drug maker, as well as Coca-Cola.
He also views Philip Morris as a well-positioned defensive
buy.
   Carime Grigoli, chief portfolio strategist at First
Boston, also is talking about defense, but he means the kind
practiced at the Pentagon.
   "The stocks I would be willing to step up and buy are
either oil-related or defense-related," says Mr. Grigoli, who
recommends Texaco, Unocal and Mobil among the oils; Coastal
as a natural-gas play; and E-Systems, which makes defense
electronics systems, to profit from increased demand for
electronic military surveillance gear.
   For long-term investors -- whom Mr. Grigoli defines as
those willing to watch the prices of their stocks go down 25%
"without losing any sleep," he recommends selected
consumer-oriented stocks. They include food producer CPC
International, Procter &amp; Gamble and health care and
personal-care giants Johnson &amp; Johnson and Gillette.
   Mr. Grigoli's near-term view of the overall market,
however, is decidedly negative. Yesterday, he predicted that
the Dow Jones Industrial Average will fall to 2500 because of
rising oil prices and a weakening U.S. economy. In a
full-blown recession, Mr. Grigoli expects the market would
trade still lower.
   Given the stock market's current volatility, Mr. Grigoli
also believes a 50 or 100-point rally in the industrial
average is a real possibility, especially if the U.S.
launches a successful military strike at Iraq. But in that
case, Mr. Grigoli says, "I would use it as an opportunity to
sell" other stocks.

   SALINAS, Calif. -- It is the top of the first at Spurs
Stadium, and things look bad for the home team.
   With bases loaded, the Salinas pitcher nicks the batter in
the arm. The third-base runner scores, and the scoreboard
flashes 0-1. From the Spurs' dugout explodes a curse directed
at the pitcher: "Baka-ka omae]"
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That's Japanese, meaning "What are you? Stupid?" You hear
it a lot in this ball park 100 miles south of San Francisco.
In April, the Spurs imported nine Japanese to fill out their
ragtag minor-league roster. The Spurs' manager, Hidehiko
Koga, is the first Japanese to pilot an American ball club.
   It seemed like a good idea. The Japanese could pick up
American baseball know-how, and maybe their discipline would
rub off on the Americans. It works when Japanese managers run
American factories, right? The plan, says Spurs co-owner Joe
Buzas, was "to create something in between the American way
of baseball and the Japanese way."
   But making Hondas and playing baseball are different. The
results have ranged from comic to heart-rending. The Class A
California League, in which the Spurs play, is near the
bottom rung of professional baseball, and the Spurs are the
last in the league, with two losses for every win. In a
typical game at Spurs Stadium, a wooden, 1947-vintage
structure with a capacity of 3,000, in the corner of a city
park dominated by stables and the scent of manure, the team
draws fewer than 500 fans.
   "We just don't have it together tonight," the 49-year-old
Mr. Koga says. He left his wife and teen-age son in Japan to
pursue his dream of managing a ball team. By the third
inning, the Spurs are trailing by 0-5. "Hetakuso]
Mittomonai]" a Japanese fan yells from the bleachers. "You're
lousy] How pathetic]"
   Still, the Spurs' other owner, Katsuaki ("Don") Nomura, a
Los Angeles real-estate developer, likes the team so much
that he has agreed to buy Mr. Buzas' half-interest this year
for $300,000, about 50% more than it cost Mr. Buzas two years
ago. The Spurs lose games but make money, in part because
Japan's Daiei Hawks, one of the teams that supplies Japanese
players, pays the Spurs $10,000 per player in addition to
footing the bill for their room and board and rather generous
salaries. The typical Japanese player earns nearly $3,500 a
month, while the typical American Spur gets only $500.
   And even with a team like the Spurs, who aren't affiliated
with any major-league team, the Japanese are picking up some
tricks of the trade from the West.
   The Japanese already consider that their baseball is
spiritually superior to the American game; they just can't
beat American teams yet. Dedicated to correct form and
fighting spirit, the Japanese treat "spring" training like
boot camp. They start in winter, swing samurai swords in
batting practice and send erring players to mountain temples
for purification. Japanese teams treasure "wa," or harmony,
which led journalist Robert Whiting to write a book on
Japanese baseball called, "You Gotta Have Wa."
   The Daiei Hawks and Tokyo's Yakult Swallows were so
pleased with the three players they apprenticed to the Spurs
as an experiment last season that they sent the three to
Japan's major league on their return. This year, the teams
sent Mr. Koga and his fresh Japanese players to learn more
from the Americans.
   They are learning American, all right. Headed into the
sixth inning, 24-year-old relief pitcher Koichi Emoto
expertly rattles off a string of notably foul four-letter
English words from the dugout. Mr. Emoto and his countrymen
have learned to chew and spit and make obscene gestures.
   There is more to learn after hours. When a Japanese player
had a batting slump, his American teammates figured he needed
to relax a bit. So after a game in Reno, Nev., they took him
to the Mustang Ranch, a famous (and legal) Nevada brothel.
The next game, he hit two homers.
   The American players have learned, too. They have learned
Japanese anatomical terms that would scandalize a Tokyo
grandmother. "With two cultures, it seems like you can relate
best with abusive language," says Corey Paul, a Spurs
outfielder and non-academic student of cultural interaction.
   The Japanese also learn baseball, although it rarely shows
on the scoreboard. They are "like sponges," says Steve Howe,
a former Los Angeles pitching ace who joined the Spurs in
April. Japanese pitchers have learned to pitch fast balls to
brush back intimidating batters instead of always trying to
trick them with curve balls or walk them, as pitchers do in
Japan. Japanese hitters learn a more powerful swing than
allowed by the formulas of their form-conscious batting
coaches back home.
   "We've learned to think for ourselves," says 20-year-old
first-baseman Kenichi Yamanuouchi. "Baseball is a lot more
fun here," says 22-year-old pitcher Shigeki Sasaki.
   Nobody blames manager Koga"Heidi" to his friends -- for
the Spurs' woes. They were in last place last year, too. His
American players are mostly castoffs from higher-class minor
league teams. The better players quickly move up. Leon
Durham, a former Chicago Cubs power hitter who plays first
base for the Spurs, says his personal objective is "to get
the hell out of here."
   Mr. Koga, soft-spoken with gray-streaked hair and a toothy
grin, knows adversity well. He joined Japan's favorite team,
the Yomiuri Giants, in 1961, only to be benched by a back
injury caused by severe training. A car-crash injury derailed
a stint with a San Francisco Giants farm team.
   After failed comebacks and other misadventures, he landed
at the Hawks as a scout and interpreter, tending to the often
unruly foreigners that Japanese teams grudgingly hire to add
a bit of power. After 11 years, he asked Mr. Buzas for the
job of managing the Spurs.
   Mr. Buzas ordered Mr. Koga to fire more than half his
starting lineup of Americans -- a "heart-breaking" task, Mr.
Koga says, that is unknown to managers in Japan -- after a
17-game losing streak. The Japanese were assured of jobs back
home at season's end. "They take care of their own kind --
it's one tight group," says outfielder Bill Carlson. "But we
knew that when we signed."
   Mr. Koga's Japanese players were aghast at their first
sight of Spurs Stadium, with its orange and blue paint
peeling from its cracked bleachers. One homesick player
returned to Japan. The rest have sometimes had
misunderstandings.
   At a game in San Jose, a pitch hit a Japanese Spur in the
head. That led to a fistfight and accusations that the
pitcher intended an "international incident." The Spurs'
American batboy has complained it took him 10 minutes to
explain to a Japanese trainer that a locker-room rat was into
the sunflower-seed supply. A Japanese coach bawled at several
bored American relief pitchers who had contrived a
bat-and-baseball "putting course" in the bullpen. He said
they weren't showing proper spirit. "No putter] No putter]"
he sputtered. "Only baseball]"
   The Spurs might be better off playing golf this night. In
the ninth inning, the opponents pad their lead by three runs
as the dust rolls in under the lights from cars leaving the
parking lot. A hapless Spur strikes out to end the game at
2-9.
   In the locker room, Mr. Koga ponders his future. He would
like to manage the Spurs next year, maybe fly them to Japan
for a few games. The Spurs have become, after all, the most
famous American minor-league team in Japan. But he worries
that what the Japanese are learning here will go for naught
back home. There, he says, traditional-bound coaches are
likely to dismiss their new ideas. Says Leon Lee, a baseball
consultant who played for a decade in Japan: "It's a shame in
a way to bring these kids to learn American ways. They'll go
back and have to wipe it all out."

   UAL Buy-Out May Be Further Snarled
   By Soaring Oil Prices, Fears of Recession

   Skyrocketing oil prices and rising recession fears have
further darkened already dim prospects of a $4.38 billion,
$201-a-share union-led buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL
Corp.
   UAL stock plunged $12.50 to $110 a share yesterday -- its
lowest level since early 1989 -- in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange only two days before UAL's board
meets to decide whether to extend Thursday's financing
deadline.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although banks were still trying to round up loan
commitments before the board meeting, many traders have
concluded that the acquisition has, as one put it, "big, big
problems."
   People familiar with the buy-out said Security Pacific
Corp. has joined Bankers Trust New York Corp. and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. as lead banks for the
acquisition, following last week's withdrawal of three other
banks from the core bank group.
   One unconfirmed report said the banks are making a
last-ditch attempt to gain loan commitments for about $2.5
billion, an amount reduced from an earlier target of roughly
$4 billion. Banks have been asked to give their commitments
today, before the UAL board meets, the report said. None of
the banks involved would comment.
   But the prospects for the buy-out have deteriorated
steadily for the past six days. Between Monday and Wednesday
of last week, UAL stock fell $27.125, to $135.875, when three
major banks balked at participating. Since Iraq invaded
Kuwait Thursday, the stock has fallen a further $25.875.
   Timothy Pettee, an airline analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
said the run-up in oil prices so far is enough to boost the
price of jet fuel to 80 cents a gallon from its prewar level
of about 60 cents -- a 33% increase. He said that could
translate to an increase of roughly $400 million in UAL's
annual jet-fuel bill, which last year totaled $1.35 billion.
UAL's total costs are currently about $10.3 billion a year.
   Although some other airline analysts said United's fuel
bill might rise as little as $150 million annually, any
increase is bound to have a significant impact on the
airline's profit. Last year, UAL earned $324.2 million, or
$14.96 a share. This year, Mr. Pettee predicts that if fuel
prices remain at their current levels, profit could tumble to
$7 a share.
   Helane Becker, airline analyst at Lehman Brothers, said,
"If we thought {the buy-out} was shaky before, this makes it
much more shaky. I think the banks are going to be a whole
lot more nervous about lending than they were six weeks ago
or even six days ago."
   There has been speculation that the union group may
restructure its offer, which currently includes $155 a share
in cash and $35 a share in notes, plus a security tied to a
sale of an interest in United's computer reservation system.
   Reducing the cash component of the bid and increasing the
amount of notes would enable the buy-out group to use less
debt. But it's unclear whether the UAL board would approve. A
spokesman for the buy-out group, which is also seeking junior
financing from the airline's suppliers and other sources,
wouldn't comment.
   At its meeting tomorrow, the board is considered likely to
grant an extension of perhaps 30 to 60 days for the buy-out
group to continue to seek financing. The group is led by
United's pilots and machinists unions, and includes flight
attendants and non-contract employees.
   However, the group faces a far more hostile climate in
which to complete the financing than it had in the first four
months since the UAL board accepted its offer April 9 under
the threat of a proxy fight.
   At its current level, analysts say United's stock isn't
far from the level at which it would trade on fundamentals
alone, without any chance of an acquisition. Until the
Mideast oil crisis raised the specter of a recession, that
level was considered to be $90 to $120 a share. Now, with
UAL's projected earnings falling amid concerns about a
recession, the range is closer to $70 to $100.
   If anything, some traders believe the Mideast crisis will
give the UAL unions a convenient excuse for falling short on
financing they wouldn't have been able to obtain anyway. Even
before, banks were reluctant to make loans for leveraged
buy-outs and had qualms about lending to a union-controlled
enterprise.
   But what isn't clear is how United can extricate itself
from a limbo in which the pilots, which first bid for United
in 1987, keep making acquisition attempts but keep falling
short. Mr. Pettee said, "This has been a three-year ordeal,
and I wouldn't be surprised if it goes on for another three
years."

   It's Obscene but Is It Art?

   Once upon a time, when the idea of a National Endowment
for the Arts was under consideration, I had some lively
arguments with my conservative friends. I supported the idea,
they opposed it. Their opposition was based on the simple and
straightforward principle that the state had no business
involving itself in this area, which should be left to
private philanthropy. I argued that it would be good for our
democracy if it showed an official interest in educating the
tastes and refining the aesthetic sensibilities of its
citizenry.
   I won the argument and now wish I hadn't. They were more
right than, at the time, they could know.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In retrospect, I can see that my error derived from the
fact that I really had only a superficial understanding of
what was happening in the arts world and no understanding of
what this portended for the future evolution of what we now
call "the arts community." I was raised in a generation that
was taught to appreciate the virtues of modern art, from
Renoir to Picasso and even to Jackson Pollock and "abstract
expressionism," though I had to admit that this last stage
had no appeal to me. "Pop art" and "minimalist art" I tended
to dismiss as trendy fads.
   But what I was utterly unprepared for was the emergence of
what is now called "post-modern art," which is a politically
charged art that is utterly contemptuous of the notion of
educating the tastes and refining the aesthetic sensibilities
of the citizenry. Its goal, instead, is deliberately to
outrage those tastes and to trash the very idea of an
"aesthetic sensibility."
   It is very difficult to convey to people who do not follow
the weird goings-on in our culture an appreciation of the
animating agenda of the "arts community" today. An ordinary
American reads about a woman "performing artist" who prances
nude across the stage, with chocolate smeared over her body,
and though he may lament the waste of chocolate or nudity, it
does not occur to him that she is "making a statement," one
that the "arts community" takes seriously indeed.
   Even museum trustees in Washington, D.C., or Cincinnati --
an elite, educated, and affluent group of arts
philanthropists -- had no idea what Mapplethorpe was up to in
his photograph of a man with a bullwhip handle inserted into
his rectum. All they knew is that Mapplethorpe was a very
talented photographer (which he was), that no such talent
could ever create an obscene work (which is false) and that
any discriminating judgment on their part was a form of
censorship that verged on the sacrilegious. Those trustees
are there to raise money and watch the museum's balance
sheet. They may or may not know what they like, but they
would never presume to assert what is, or is not, "art." To
qualify to become a museum trustee these days one must first
suffer aesthetic castration.
   To reach our current condition, it took a century of
"permanent revolution" in the arts, made possible,
ironically, by a capitalist economy which created affluent
art collectors and entrepreneurial art dealers. "Patrons" of
the arts were replaced by "consumers" of the arts, giving the
artist an intoxicating freedom.
   It was the artist, now, who told us what was and was not
"art" -- not the patron, or the philosopher, or the public.
The function of the spectator was to welcome revolutions in
taste by permitting himself to be intimidated and
indoctrinated by the "arts community," consisting of artists
themselves but also and especially (since artists are not
usually articulate) art critics, art professors, art dealers,
museum directors, etc. The most important spectators who were
so intimidated and indoctrinated were the media, which now
automatically approach anything declared to be "art" by the
"arts community" with the kind of deference, even
pseudo-piety, once reserved for the sphere of religion.
   As with most revolutions, some impressive creative
energies were released, some enduring accomplishments were
achieved. But, again as with most revolutions, the longer it
lasted the more the destructive impulse began to dominate
over the creative. Yesteryear's creative contributions were,
after all, what the latest revolutionary phase had to subvert
and overthrow.
   After World War II, it became ever more difficult to
distinguish artists from publicity-hungry pseudo-artists,
from people "making statements" of one kind or other, such
"statements" being the essence of pop art, minimalist art,
environmental art, and now post-modern art. That practically
all of this activity was infused by an anti-bourgeois ethos
was unsurprising, since it was simply mirroring the literary
and academic culture in this respect. The bourgeois way of
coping with this situation was to purchase and "consume" this
art as a commodity, to inventory it and then at some point to
expel it from its system into an underground sump, usually
located in the basement of museums. Cooptation, not
censorship, was the strategy.
   But this strategy does not work with the last and, one
suspects, final phase of the revolution we are now
witnessing. Today, the destructive element has almost
completely overwhelmed the creative. What the "arts
community" is engaged in is a politics of radical nihilism;
it has little interest in, and will openly express contempt
for, "art" in any traditional sense of the term. It is no
exaggeration to say that the self-destruction of "art" is a
key point in its agenda, accompanied by the "deconstruction,"
not only of bourgeois society, but of Western civilization
itself.
   "Deconstruction" is an intellectual-ideological movement
that is enormously popular in the humanities departments of
our universities, which seek to free themselves from the
"hegemony" of Dead White Males (DWMs is the common reference)
such as Shakespeare or Dante so as to justify offering a
university course on, say, the TV program "The Simpsons."
There are no standards of excellence other than those we
improvise for ourselves, which is why members of the "arts
community" can solemnly believe and assert that whatever they
do is "art." The public has the right -- nay, the obligation
-- to support it, but not to question it.
   What they do, in fact, is powerfully shaped by certain
radical ideological currents; radical feminism, homosexual
and lesbian self-celebration and black racism are among them.
This explains why, though it is "de rigeur" to insult public
figures, no one in the "arts community" would ever dare
insult the Rev. Louis Farrakhan. Any such painting would
promptly be vandalized, to the applause of an "arts
community" opposed to censorship. It also explains why there
is so little pornography, in the traditional sense, in
post-modern art. Such pornography evokes lust for
heterosexual engagement, which post-modern art disapproves of
since it is thought to debase women. Only homosexual and
lesbian sex are allowed to be celebrated.
   But if pornography is limited to the homosexual sphere,
obscenity is unlimited. The purpose of such obscenity is to
deride the Judaeo-Christian-humanist idea of "human dignity"
that Western civilization has fostered. If Western
civilization is itself an obscene heritage of racism, sexism
and "elitist" oppression, obscenity is obviously an
appropriate response.
   Where will it all end? One does have the sense that we are
witnessing either a final convulsion in the history of modern
art (and of modern culture) or, perhaps, a final convulsion
in Western civilization itself. Most of us would incline to
credit the first alternative. But where does that leave the
National Endowment for the Arts, founded in a different time
and on quite different assumptions about the role of the arts
in American life?
   The most obvious response would be to abolish the NEA --
perhaps over a period of a few years to mitigate the
financial shock. This is not going to happen, however. After
all, many major institutions -- symphony orchestras, for
instance, and large museums -- have inevitably become
dependent on NEA grants. The trustees of these institutions
have considerable influence with members of Congress, who are
much happier opening funding spigots than closing them. And
the media, it goes without saying, would be horrified at such
an effort at "censorship," now redefined to include the
absence of government funding.
   A more limited response would be to move the NEA away from
involvement with the most active and turbulent sectors of the
"arts community" by requiring that it make only grants of
more than $50,000 or $100,000. The institutions receiving
this money will be held responsible for any re-grants they
make.
   Most of the controversial grants one hears of are
small-to-modest. But they do serve an important role in
legitimating the activity that is being funded. With $10,000
from the NEA, an "experimental workshop in the arts" can
approach foundations and corporations with a plausible claim
to respectability. That is precisely why they will fight
tooth and nail for the continuation of the small-grants
program -- grants made by other members of the "arts
community," their "peer groups," to their friends and allies.
Just how Congress will respond to such a reform, now being
bruited, remains to be seen.
   But one interesting and important fact has already become
clear: Our politics today is so spiritually empty, so morally
incoherent, that -- except for a few brave souls -- liberals
have been quick to dismiss as "yahoos" anyone who dares to
confront this assault on the foundations of liberalism and
conservatism alike. A great many conservatives, for their
part, having long ago been ideologically disarmed, are more
embarrassed than interested at having to cope with this issue
at all. Something is definitely rotten in the vital areas of
our body politic.

   No Laughs, Not Much Magic

   Kurt Vonnegut Jr. was the novelist for the 60s.
   His primary concerns dovetailed with the fears of a
generation determined to change America's course. His novels
preached the folly of war. They warned of a nightmare future
ruled by machines, not men. They advocated sex. ("Make love
when you can. It's good for you," reads the non sequitur that
ends the introduction to "Mother Night.") The point of view
was an innocent looking out with a mixture of horror and
resignation on a world gone bad.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The aim, as stated in "Slaughterhouse Five" was a life in
which "everything was beautiful and nothing hurt." If one
phrase from Mr. Vonnegut still rings in aging American minds
it is most likely "So it goes," the gentle-but-cynical words
that follow each of the scores of references to death in
"Slaughterhouse Five." That novel was published in 1969. Not
long thereafter "so it goes" had been used so often in the
Harvard Crimson that editors sought to ban the phrase.
   The easiest thing to say about "Hocus Pocus," (Putnam's,
302 pages, $21.95) is that it is recognizably Vonnegut.
Vietnam, Auschwitz, militarism and the stupidly mega-rich are
bad. Sex is good. Misfortune is everywhere. America is
sinking into a dark night.
   It is 2001. Vietnam veteran and avid fornicator Eugene
Debs Hartke is in prison awaiting trial in the upstate New
York area where many of Mr. Vonnegut's novels take place.
   The purchase of America by foreigners has been galloping
along. Du Pont Co. belongs to Germany's I.G. Farben. The New
York Times is owned by Korean interests. Italians own
Anheuser-Busch Cos. and the Japanese own most of the rest,
including the prison across the lake from the college where
Hartke teaches.
   The Japanese run the prison on a for-profit basis, having
proved they can do it cheaper. But class warfare and
lawlessness are so rampant in the U.S. that the Japanese are
abandoning their investments, simply walking away. There are
reports they will keep Hawaii as a memento of the high-water
mark of their economic empire as the British kept Bermuda.
   The U.S. Army is engaged more or less full time fighting
its own people and responding to emergencies like the mass
breakout from the Japanese-run prison that turns Hartke into
a prisoner himself, because he's suspected of abetting the
prisoners.
   The hot stock of the day is a company called Microsecond
Arbitrage. It turns out, not surprisingly in Vonnegut-land,
to be a sucker play.
   Such a landscape isn't totally unpromising. But since the
'60s, black humor has been a well-worked mine. Novels of a
nuclear bomb-bleak world or post-environmental holocaust
future have been so common you'd think they were required
exercises for novelists, like bar exams for lawyers.
   It isn't enough to look into the future and report that it
is dark. Novels generally need characters and narrative pace.
Mr. Vonnegut often has done without both.
   In "Slaughterhouse Five" he writes, "There are almost no
characters in this story, and almost no dramatic
confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick
and so much the playthings of enormous forces." They also are
playthings for Mr. Vonnegut, who likes to march them onstage,
whirl them around and then dispatch them when the joke or
idea they serve has been exhausted.
   He favors an equal arbitrariness of narrative, often
avoiding transitions in favor of series of brief, telegraphic
blocks of type. Now, in "Hocus Pocus" the method betrays him.
   We are told that prisoner Hartke wrote on scraps of paper
retrieved from wherever he could find them. The novel is
divided by lines on the page representing where each scrap
begins and ends. Some sections are only a line or two long
and few are longer than a single page. It is tiresomely
repetitive and fails to mask that the novel has no momentum
and, ultimately, no point. Unlike the best Vonnegut, "Hocus
Pocus" is so random as to stir no outrage and provoke no
laughter.
   Part of the problem is Hartke. He was the last American
lifted off the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon in 1975 and
went from a career in the U.S. Army to a teaching post at a
curious college for the slightly learning-disabled children
of the very rich. His jottings, however, fail to make him
convincing as a soldier, as a lover or as a prisoner. His
gee-whiz digressions to discuss what he has been reading or
thinking about are lifeless.
   "Hocus Pocus" even wheels on stage Tralfamadore, the
planet that captured Billy Pilgrim and put him on display
with Montana Wildhack in "Slaughterhouse Five." But here,
Tralfamadore is debased. Instead of a charming planet of wise
little creatures who see time as a continuum, rather than
living it moment-by-moment, now it is represented by a
renegade group called the Elders who have a cockeyed plan to
spread life through the universe. Hartke comes upon their
story in a skin magazine called "Black Garterbelt."
   In addition to writing on his slips of paper, Hartke is
passing his jailtime drawing up lists of all his sexual
partners and all the people he has killed. Lo and behold, the
lists seem to be of equal length. Some coincidence.
   "Hocus Pocus" is heavy on coincidence and light on
meaning. The title suggests we will be dazzled, but there's
no magic here.

   CHRYSLER CORP. asks UAW to consider new retiree
health-care financing.
   The auto maker, concerned that a contemplated
accounting-rule change could add a balance-sheet liability of
$7 an hour for each employee, has proposed shifting the cost
of retiree health benefits to a trust representing a number
of employers. Transferring the load to a so-called
multiemployer trust could spare Chrysler from listing its
retiree health liabilities on its own books, a requirement
proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board for
1993.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The FASB, however, may not look kindly on the Chrysler
plan. "We're looking very carefully at tightening the
definition so companies may not avoid their promise by trying
to structure something that looks like a multiemployer plan
or smells like one, but isn't," an FASB official says. The
United Auto Workers also might be reluctant to give its
assent, since a multiemployer trust, rather than Chrysler,
would be responsible for assuring retiree benefits.
   The union is likely to resist unless General Motors Corp.
and Ford Motor Co. also join the trust.
                                                                                                       

   MANY OTHER FIRMS push retirees to pay a bigger share of
health costs.
   Faced with mounting medical-insurance bills and a rising
retiree population, as well as the proposed FASB rule, a
number of companies are requiring retired workers to pick up
a larger portion of their doctor and hospital bills.
Consultant A. Foster Higgins &amp; Co. says a survey of 1,100
companies with retiree benefits shows 43% have revised their
rules in the past two years or are planning to do so this
year.
   Fully 28% of the companies are asking retirees to pay
bigger premiums, 18% are increasing deductibles and 14% are
reducing benefits. Employers, moreover, are rewriting the
link between the corporate coverage and Medicare to reduce
the company's load for retirees over age 65. But the
cost-cutting strategies could backfire, warns Patricia Wilson
of Foster Higgins. Workers could demand raises to offset the
expected boost in health costs when they retire, she says.
                                                                                                       

   LEISURE TOPS WORK as the main focus of Americans. But not
executives.
   For the first time in 15 years of posing the question, the
Roper Organization finds 41% of adult Americans put leisure
ahead of work as "the important thing" in their lives; only
36% put work first. Among college students, the pattern is
even stronger. Leisure ranks paramount for 47%; 30% give
greater emphasis to work. In the executive suite, though, the
work ethic still rules.
   "I view work as my No. 1 priority," asserts Robert Knox,
president of Prudential Capital Venture Management.
Marguerite Barnett, the University of Houston's new
president, allows she thinks about work even while playing
golf. Larry Reburn, a vice president of Sbarro Inc., says he
considers leisure "equally as important as the satisfaction I
get from work." Still, he puts in 60 to 70 hours a week at
his job. But if other Americans don't share the work drive,
Larry Lyons, a GM engineering manager, isn't especially
concerned about any loss of international competitiveness.
   "Even the Japanese are realizing there are other things to
do at night," Mr. Lyons declares.
                                                                                                       

   DRUG TESTING of job candidates becomes nearly universal at
major companies. CompuChem Corp. says 96% of the nation's top
100 companies screen applicants.
                                                                                                       

   DATA-PROCESSING service firm executives received 6.2% pay
increases in 1989 and are expected to get 5.9% boosts both
this year and next, all at least 0.4 percentage point ahead
of general industry, consultant William M. Mercer Inc. says.
                                                                                                       

   WELL, MAYBE] To workers who get other job offers, 38% of
employers say they wouldn't extend a counter bid and 21% say
they would, Management Recruiters International finds. But
38% say it all depends.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA contractors, under a pact with the
carpenters union, contribute $5 million, at the rate of 18
cents for each hour a carpenter works, to promote
poured-in-place concrete construction. The carpenters build
the concrete forms.
                                                                                                       

   WORKERS COMP SYSTEM clogs access to medical care, a study
contends.
   Workers hurt on the job have more trouble getting quality
medical care than people with comparable injuries from
nonwork accidents, the Massachusetts Workers' Compensation
Advisory Council says. A study for the state group by Lynch,
Ryan &amp; Associates and Boylston Group says both sets of
patients with back injuries can get immediate care. But
"difficulty increases" as work victims seek access to
specialists and rehabilitation, the researchers say.
   Doctors view compensation cases as less desirable because
they believe lawyers, insurers and employers interfere,
workers aren't motivated, fees are lower and paperwork is
burdensome. But the researchers say the other parties have
grievances, too, and all are "convinced the others represent
the weak link" in the compensation chain.
   Coordinated care and speedier reimbursements could ease
patient and doctor complaints, the study suggests.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Four of five companies welcome government
efforts to simplify pension regulations, but half of them
fret the simplifications so far can only create new problems,
Buck Consultants finds. . . . And you thought you were afraid
to fly? Airline pilots in training sessions run by Scientific
Methods Inc. say they worry about cabin fires, electrical
failure, terrorism, engine failure and decompression, for
starters.

   Merrill Lynch Said
   To Be Seeking
   Buyer for Unit

   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. is searching for a buyer for Merrill
Lynch, Hubbard Inc., its real estate investment and
syndication unit, according to two people familiar with the
company's efforts.
   Hubbard, which has about 105 employees, manages
approximately $1.5 billion of commercial and residential real
estate for more than 230,000 investors in 10 partnerships.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch has been retreating to its core of
securities brokerage and investment banking businesses for
more than a year. The Hubbard unit has been for sale since
early this year, according to people familiar with the
efforts. But turmoil in the market for real estate limited
partnerships has reduced the number of potential buyers.
   Two syndicators who remain strong -- Atlanta-based
Equitable Real Estate Investment Management Inc., and
Chicago-based JMB Realty -- are considering the acquisition
of Hubbard, according to people familiar with Merrill's
efforts.
   "Hubbard is under constant review, but no decision to sell
it has been made as of this date," said Merrill spokesman
William Clark, who would not comment on whether the unit is
for sale.
   Merrill officials decline to disclose how much they are
asking for the unit, as do officials from both Equitable and
JMB Realty.
   Between 1981 and 1987, Hubbard raised $1.7 billion dollars
to purchase real estate through a series of six MLH Income
Realty Partnerships. Hubbard made cash-based acquisitions of
commercial properties with strong cash flows and good
potentials for appreciation, according to Larry Kay, who
follows Hubbard for Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   After flourishing in the mid-1980s, the market for real
estate limited partnerships was crippled by the 1986 Tax
Reform Act. Previously, investors were able to write off
losses from real esate limited partnerships against ordinary
income. After 1986, the losses could only be written off
against passive income, such as income from other limited
partnerships. The collapse of real estate markets in the
South, Southwest, and Northeast also stemmed the flow of
investors seeking to capitalize on runaway real estate
prices.
   The deterioration of the market threw Integrated Resources
Inc. in New York and Southmark Corp. of Dallas, two
syndicators that relied heavily on investors seeking tax
shelters, into bankruptcy-court proceedings. Unlike Hubbard,
these two syndicators had highly leveraged portfolios.

   Japanese Agency Calls Expansion
   Sustainable Despite Oil Worries

   TOKYO -- Japan's current economic expansion is healthy and
sustainable, notwithstanding the prospect of higher world oil
prices and interest rates, a government agency said.
   But the Economic Planning Agency urged the cabinet of
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to accelerate deregulation of
the economy, enforce antitrust laws more stringently and
guard against the polarization of the haves and have-nots in
Japan's increasingly wealthy society.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The recommendations, contained in the agency's annual
economic white paper, mirror some of the suggestions the U.S.
put forward in recent bilateral talks on structural economic
changes.
   In large part, the report praises Japan's management of
its current economic expansion. Now in its 45th month, the
expansion is the country's second longest since World War II.
A 57-month period in the late 1960s remains postwar Japan's
longest boom. The average rate of growth during the current
expansion is 5.7%, compared with 12.1% in the earlier cycle.
As in the previous major expansion, strong consumer spending
and capital investment are the leading factors.
   "We see no domestic reason why the expansion would come to
an end," said Shousuke Tanaka, director-general of the
Economic Planning Agency's research division.
   Even the impact on world oil prices of Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait doesn't threaten Japan's health, he said. In the past,
oil has been the Achilles' heel of Japan's economic
juggernaut. The surge in crude prices during the oil crises
of 1973 and 1979 set off inflation and curtailed growth. But
today, Mr. Tanaka said, Japan's dependence on oil for
economic productivity is markedly lower. Nowadays, he said,
an increase of 10% in world oil prices would translate to a
0.1 percentage-point increase in consumer prices.
   Japan's strengths, the agency said, lie in its corporate
innovation and use of technology. But the economy also has
benefited from intercompany relationships -- many Japanese
concerns have close links to suppliers and distributors --
that help industry keep costs down.
   The agency warned that outsiders shouldn't be excluded
from that system and said that deregulation of the economy
would help. But it also cautioned that Japan's antitrust
authorities should be given more power to dismantle alliances
that go beyond the boundaries of law and international
acceptance. Mr. Tanaka suggested the country's Fair Trade
Commission should have power to recommend criminal punishment
for violations of antitrust codes.
   Another big boost for Japan's industry has been a
cooperative labor force. But the agency warned that equality
among Japanese workers is diminishing.
   "More than 50% of Japanese people live in houses with
land, but the other half doesn't have land" in a country
where property prices have skyrocketed, he said. "We are
seeing a very large social issue beginning to emerge."
   The planning agency also urged the government to do more
abroad. Japan now spends about $9 billion, an amount
equivalent to about 0.8% of its economic output, on official
development assistance. The agency recommended that the
proportion be increased.

   "There's a sleeping giant in this country," says Rodney
Crowell, the distinguished Nashville singer and songwriter,
"and one of these days it may wake up on the wrong side of
the bed."
   Crowell was one of the first country musicians to campaign
actively against the current movement to censor music. (He
testified in several state legislatures against bills to
impose labeling of records with offensive contents.) But even
he seems startled by the escalating crusade against
heavy-metal rockers and black rap groups.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The well-publicized rap group 2 Live Crew continues to
cause arrests. In San Antonio, David Risher, owner of that
city's Hog Wild Record and Tape store, was arraigned recently
on a charge of promoting obscene material. Ignoring police
warnings, he had sold a copy of the group's record to the son
of a local anti-pornography crusader. Since the record "As
Nasty as They Wanna Be" was ruled obscene in May by a federal
judge in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., police in Texas, Florida and
Ohio have told store owners not to sell it. In Dallas an
assistant DA, a candidate for a local judgeship, has begun to
target two of the largest record chains in the state. Three
members of the group itself were busted after an "adults
only" performance in Fort Lauderdale.
   But more is involved than a vulgar and musically mediocre
group of ghetto kids. The British heavy-metal group Judas
Priest is currently spending its days in a Reno, Nev.,
courtroom. The group's members are defendants, along with CBS
records in a product-liability suit that charges their record
"Stained Class" implanted subliminal suggestions that caused
two fans to commit suicide. Even the "stickering" bills,
believed moribund after the industry adopted a voluntary
program, are making a comeback. One recently passed the
Louisiana Legislature, but was promptly vetoed by the
governor.
   It seems that Crowell's sleeping giant is beginning to
stir, prodded by opportunistic politicians, and it may lumber
along for a while, causing a great deal of damage. Elected
officials must be sensing a constituency demand to bring
these obscenity cases. Otherwise, why risk the predictable
ridicule in the national press? Furthermore, support for this
censorship isn't simply a case of middle-class parents
reacting to adolescent provocation.
   The most chilling report in the midst of the Broward
County, Fla., uproar over 2 Live Crew actually concerned a
school play at the Wilton Manors Elementary School.
   Staff at the South Florida school had written a musical
called "In Quest of the Banjo Man" to help teach geography.
Some 100 fifth-graders were set to stage the tale of a
starfish who crawls from continent to continent, encountering
a variety of cultures. That is, until parents of one student
read and reread the script, carefully annotating what they
saw as references to voodoo, paganism and devil worship. The
parents noted, for instance, that the play mentioned 33
countries in Europe, which multiplied by two is 66, one digit
short of the "Number of the Beast," 666. These parents,
supported by their pastor, took their complaint to the school
principal, who canceled the play.
   The complaints were one thing. People have been seeing
Satan under the bed for a long time. What's new is that
community leaders are taking them seriously. Several years
ago, we laughed at the activist who heard a paean to the
devil in a backward version of the theme song to "Mr. Ed,"
the television series about a talking horse. Now his group is
leading the crusade against 2 Live Crew.
   These far-out attitudes gain respectability as they move
into a void called "defense of Middle Class values." Most
people are disgusted by obscenity. If the courts and "opinion
leaders" have trouble defining it, less bashful crusaders
pick up support by default. And if there is a history of
debate on literary standards, the field is wide open when it
comes to music.
   As a musician, Crowell asks why people are picking on the
record industry when dirty books and X-rated videos sell
freely. One reason is that religious crusaders have grasped
an idea that still eludes traditional politicians, that music
is a supremely important political phenomenon.
   This idea, as old as Plato, recently gained currency in
Allan Bloom's surprise best seller, "The Closing of the
American Mind." But it was already percolating in the
evangelical debate over using rock 'n' roll as a means of
religious expression. (A leading opponent of "Christian
rock," the fallen preacher Jimmy Swaggart, is a talented
musician himself, and the cousin of rockabilly great Jerry
Lee Lewis.)
   Mr. Bloom's, and Swaggart's, argument centers on music as
an expression of a state of soul. In the classical
understanding, the city should foster the mode of music
appropriate to its regime. Although Mr. Bloom became famous
for denouncing rock 'n' roll, his point was to explain Plato.
It wouldn't be the first time that a subtle exercise in
philosophy spawned a political monster.
   Mr. Bloom's fans are attacking rap and heavy metal in a
spirit that was possibly appropriate to the homogeneous,
small-scale Greek city-state, but becomes a disaster imposed
on modern mass culture. In modern form, this spirit has
caused most of the miseries of the miserable 20th century.
   A country performer such as Rodney Crowell might be more
in tune with the tastes of Swaggart's constituency, but he
senses how dangerous it might be to inflame and mislead its
passions. The politicians who smell a soft target in the
music industry should listen to his warning.

   BRUSSELS -- Lufthansa German Airlines said it intends to
press its case for buying 26% of the East German state-owned
carrier Interflug, despite the West German Federal Cartel
Office's warning that the bid will be rejected.
   The antitrust agency has noted that Lufthansa, 51%-owned
by the state, already dominates the West German domestic air
market and the market from West Germany to European
destinations. A Lufthansa-Interflug combination would control
53% of these markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Lufthansa said Interflug is too small to affect
Lufthansa's market position greatly. Interflug has
drastically trimmed its flight program recently. Moreover,
Lufthansa has no landing rights at airports in East or West
Berlin. A value hasn't been assigned to the 26% Interflug
stake Lufthansa wants to buy.
   "We don't understand why the cartel office objects,"
Lufthansa said. "But their decision isn't final. We have
until mid-August to write them and state our intentions."
Under West German law, any stake exceeding 25% is considered
a merger. The antitrust agency said Lufthansa could challenge
a ban in court. Or Lufthansa could ask the West German
Economics Ministry to overrule such a decision, in which case
the airline would have to prove that the proposed acquisition
is for the common economic good.
   Interflug said it will back Lufthansa's effort to win
approval for the deal, though Interflug itself can't respond
to the West German cartel agency.

   NEW YORK -- A New York state trial court, backing
Southland Corp. in a dispute with New York's attorney
general, said franchisers in the state may negotiate deals
that vary from the terms in franchise documents.
   "The decision, the first of its kind, is expected to have
a broad impact on the way franchisers operate nationwide,"
said David J. Kaufmann, attorney for Southland, Dallas-based
franchiser of 7-Eleven stores.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The office of Attorney General Robert Abrams is studying
whether to appeal the decision of Justice Elliott Wilk.
   The dispute arose last year, after Southland negotiated a
deal with the Riese Organization, under which the New York
real estate concern would open 7-Eleven stores in Manhattan.
After the negotiations, Southland moved to amend its
franchise papers. Attorneys for the state argued that
amendments must come first; talks, second.
   Before clearing the amendment, the state asked Southland
to sign an "assurance of discontinuance" of improper
franchising practices and pay $1,000 in costs. Southland did
both, but sought in the court case to establish that New York
franchise law permitted the original negotiations.
   Justice Wilk ruled that the office of the state's attorney
general had exceeded its authority "by creating a substantive
requirement that a franchise must be offered on terms
unilaterally decided upon by the franchiser, without input
from prospective franchisees via post-registration
negotiations."

   Squeeze in Profession Leads Doctors
   To Seek Advice on Marketing

   Dr. Miran Bethel, an obstetrician gynecologist, has a new
sideline: selling ovulation-testing kits from his practice in
downtown Los Angeles.
   Although the Ovuquick kit he sells is an especially
accurate means of predicting the date of a woman's ovulation,
it isn't readily available in local drugstores, Dr. Bethel
says. Offering the kit has attracted numerous new patients,
he adds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The sideline was the brainchild of Steven Getzoff, partner
in Getzoff &amp; Krowne, Encino, Calif., which has built its
business by helping doctors make more money from their
practices. Among other services, it keeps an eye out for new
opportunities in the medical world. Five years ago, it was
advising clients to offer longer office hours. Now, it's
telling clients to sell products in their practices.
   Concerns such as Getzoff &amp; Krowne are thriving because of
a growing squeeze on U.S. doctors. The American Medical
Association estimates that the number of doctors in the
nation jumped to 237 physicians per 100,000 inhabitants in
1988 from 202 in 1980, increasing the competition in the
profession. At the same time, employers, insurers and the
government are trying to squeeze medical costs. Thus, the
average doctor received only 119 patient visits a week in
1987, down from 129 in 1982.
   Not surprisingly, doctors are increasingly anxious to hear
from entrepreneurs who can help them make more money. These
entrepreneurs are boosting the incomes of many doctors -- and
changing the way they conduct their practices.
   Assisting doctors with their business problems is no
novelty. Since 1932, Professional Management Group has helped
physicians collect delinquent payments. The group says total
billings reached $24 million last year, a 20% rise from 1986.
It now boasts 62 franchises, including three in Detroit alone
that have opened since 1988.
   But consultants in the field are sharply expanding the
scope of their work. Once confined to bill collecting and
similar tasks, they now specialize in everything from public
relations to the installation of laboratories.
   Sharon Yenney, of CBY Associates Inc. in Washington, D.C.,
moved into consulting seven years ago after a career in
hospital management. She began with a focus on preventive
medicine, but helping doctors market their services now
accounts for 30% of her business.
   For example, a plastic surgeon came to her in 1989 who
wanted to move away from reconstructive surgery into cosmetic
surgery. Ms. Yenney advised him to contact all the physicians
who had referred patients to him and to speak candidly with
them about what he wanted to do. "That seems kind of obvious
. . . but you'd be surprised how few physicians will think of
doing it," she says.
   Others with health-care experience also have seen
marketing opportunities. Rebecca Anwar was on the faculty of
the Medical College of the University of Pennsylvania for 14
years before starting Hoover Anwar Associates in 1986. While
a member of the faculty, Dr. Anwar watched the growing
competition and noticed the number of doctors leaving college
unable to find work. For her, the solution lay in better
communication to potential patients of what the doctor had to
offer.
   For an orthopedic surgeon who wanted to specialize in
joint replacement, Dr. Anwar came up with a brochure
specifically designed for the older population and
distributed it through a direct-mail run to retirement
communities. This appeal was so successful the surgeon opened
two other practices and had to find a partner.
   Roland Wussow, of Wussow Consulting Group in Nashville,
Tenn., is in what he calls the "image-management business."
His clients include doctors who are building businesses based
on changes in the medical profession.
   One client is Alan Pierrot, an orthopedic surgeon in
Fresno, Calif., who believes that funding cuts are eroding
the quality of health care. He and 94 other physicians
decided to create an alternative to the traditional hospital,
the Fresno Surgery and Recovery Care Center. Started in 1988,
it claims to be a "hotel with nurses" at 70% of the price of
a hospital ward.
   Dr. Pierrot asked Mr. Wussow to provide a "total
communication strategy" for the center. The brochure that he
produced for the center and distributed to the medical world
helped attract a large number of visitors and contributed to
the center's success, Dr. Pierrot says. Shares in the
for-profit Fresno Surgery Center, originally issued at $8,000
apiece, now are trading at $18,000.
   Joyce Stevens, of New England Laboratory Consultants in
Princeton, Mass., offers a more specialized service to the
medical profession. She helps physicians to install labs in
their own practices, advising them on the machinery they buy
and then ensuring that they conduct the quality-control and
proficiency testing necessary to gain a license to use it in
Massachusetts. Such labs can help doctors boost their incomes
significantly. Instead of referring patients to outside labs,
doctors can collect the testing revenue themselves. Above
all, Ms. Stevens says, her job involves "keeping abreast of
what's new" in laboratory equipment that is appropriate for
doctors' offices.
   Ms. Stevens left her job as hematology supervisor at the
University of Massachusetts Medical Center five years ago to
look after her children. Consulting to physicians is still
only a part-time occupation for her. But she believes she may
soon have a backlog of work orders, depending on the
implementation of a new federal law that would require
physician office labs handling a high volume of work to be
licensed. According to an American Medical Association
estimate in June 1988, about 100,000 physician office labs
could be affected.
   But some experts say some efforts to make doctor practices
more profitable just don't pay. Bill Kidd, executive
secretary of the Society of Medical and Dental Management
Consultants, Kansas City, says: "It's difficult to make a
strong recommendation for {more aggressive physician
marketing} when you just don't see the results." But he
concedes that he knows of a dentist in Kenosha, Wis., who
doubled the size of his advertisement in the Yellow Pages and
found that the demand for his services doubled as well.

   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. -- American Health Services Corp.
said E. Larry Atkins was named president and chief executive
officer, succeeding S. Lewis Meyer, who resigned those
positions, as well as those of chairman and director.
   The change follows the sale earlier this year of new
preferred stock and warrants representing a 30% stake in the
operator of medical diagnostic imaging centers to OmniCorp
Holdings Inc., U.S. arm of OmniCorp A.G., a Swiss concern
that is, in turn, controlled by Swiss investor Werner Rey.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   OmniCorp acquired its stake for $7 million and assumed
three seats on American Health's seven-member board.
   A spokesman for American Health said Mr. Meyer, 46 years
old, resigned after "differences over the company's direction
as a whole between not only Omni's directors, but all the
directors led to a feeling that it was time for a change."
   Mr. Atkins, 43, has been executive vice president and
chief operating officer of American Health. The company
spokesman said the position of chairman will remain vacant
for the moment.
   American Health stock closed yesterday unchanged, at $1.50
a share, in over-the-counter trading. Announcement of the
change was made shortly before the close of trading.

   It's one of those steamy, ozone-alert summer days when New
York is lying defeated under a gray haze and anybody with any
sense is elsewhere. But some 565,000 people will head into
New York anyway, braving the airless PATH train stations,
buses that fling noxious fumes behind them like curses, cars
nudging their way to the tunnel and bridge tollbooths, and
other injustices of the New Jersey commute.
   Another happier 1,600 will board a ferryboat and breeze
across the Hudson in 10 to 20 minutes. The only
inconvenience? Nothing a comb can't fix.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's wonderful, it's marvelous, and it's true: The ferries
are back. The orange-yellow Staten Island Ferry is no longer
the lone, lonely holdout from the days when ferries were the
only means of getting to New York. Independent passenger
ferries have sprouted up along the Hudson River from
Weehawken to the Highlands, N.J., and in New York Bay from
Bay Ridge, Brooklyn to Inwood, Long Island. In all, 12
ferries now bring commuters, day-trippers, tourists and just
plain people in need of a breeze to and from Manhattan.
   "It's a new age of mass transit," says Arthur Imperatore,
who is not an impartial observer. He started the Port
Imperial Ferry System, a bus-and-ferry service from Weehawken
to midtown and downtown Manhattan.
   "Look at that tunnel," he says on a morning run to
Manhattan, pointing at the Lincoln Tunnel, where traffic is
backed up at least a mile. "They don't know how long it's
going to take them to get to work. We've eliminated the
uncertainty."
   But running a ferry like a Swiss clock isn't always
enough, Mr. Imperatore has discovered. When he arrives at the
landing, four women are waiting for him. "It's not working,"
wails Donna Hamilton of Guttenberg. "We have to be at work by
9:30 and the bus didn't come until 9:15." She's referring to
Port Imperial's new expanded bus service that connects the
boats with the New Jersey Transit system's buses. "I'll fix
it," he tells her, but he looks troubled. He has a lot to do.
Mr. Imperatore is a hands-on CEO. He picks up litter, checks
a doorstop, listens to the propeller for signs of damage by
driftwood, tells a captain not to bump the dock when he
brings in the boat: "No bumper cars, all right?"
   Mr. Imperatore's basic business is trucking and real
estate -- he is chairman of APA Transport and president of
Arcorp Properties, which includes the ferry. He projects a $1
million profit on Port Imperial this year, but his reasons
for starting up the ferry in 1986 were sentimental. He grew
up in West New York, N.J., a town perched atop the Hudsonside
cliffs known as the Palisades, and remembers walking down
"ferry hill" to ride the Weehawken Ferry for four cents.
Later he sent his trucks to Manhattan via the ferry to shave
48 cents off the cost of crossing via the Lincoln Tunnel.
   Four years ago, Mr. Imperatore made a few runs across the
river in his yacht one Sunday, at speeds equivalent to a
ferryboat's. "It took an average of two-and-a-half minutes to
cross. I thought: How long do you stop at one stoplight? Two,
two-and-a-half minutes, sometimes. That was the beginning."
   Arcorp's Port Imperial ferries (1-201-902-8850) run daily
to West 38th Street for $4 one way, and to Whitehall Street
for $5. Port Imperial provides parking and bus service to and
from the terminals in New Jersey and New York at extra cost.
Arcorp also operates the Hoboken Ferry (1-201-GO-FERRY) in
partnership with neighboring Hartz Mountain Industries. The
service operates under the aegis of the Port Authority of New
York and New Jersey.
   The sparkling white boat takes riders to the Battery Park
City esplanade weekdays during rush hour and all day Saturday
for $2.
   Among the other ferries:
   TNT Hydrolines (1-201-228-7433) runs a high-speed ferry at
rush hour from Atlantic Highlands, N.J. ($13), and Bay Ridge,
Brooklyn ($4), to Wall Street. The most elitist of common
carriers is the Port Liberte Express, which serves residents
of Jersey City's Port Liberte development, sailing to and
from Wall Street six days a week ($5). The Rolls-Royce of
ferries, the Metro Marine Express (1-212-509-4600) serves
breakfast and afternoon cocktails and speeds from Inwood on
the south shore of Long Island to East 34th Street and Wall
Street in about an hour ($7). For $25, it will take you from
Manhattan to JFK airport, with car service to cover the last
lap.
   Most ferries are private enterprises; the exception is the
heavily subsidized Staten Island Ferry, which doubled its
fare Aug. 1 from 25 to 50 cents, the first increase in 15
years.
   Inflation and glamour have changed ferry travel from the
way it used to be in the first ferry era, when the ferries
were the cheapest way to go. "We always took the ferry,
because it was 25 cents and the bridge was 50 cents," says
retiree Phil Taylor, "when you could buy a tuna-fish sandwich
at the luncheonette for a quarter." He drove his car onto the
ferry in the 1930s: "The fare was 25 cents for a car, a
driver, and one passenger. Each additional person was five
cents. So the other guys would duck in the back seat to save
a nickel."
   Ferries go way back. Raritan Indians were the first
ferrymen, using canoes to convey Dutch settlers across the
Arthur Kill to Staten Island around 1650. New York's
population was 1,500 when settlers ran a ferry across the
Harlem and Hudson rivers to start a postal service (one man
on a horse, from New York to Boston) in 1673.
   Eighteenth-century ferry riders had to contend with long
waits: The ferry owner often ran a tavern nearby, and stood
to profit from delays. Boats were slow, too, propelled by
paddles driven by horses on a treadmill.
   The trip was quicker with the world's first steam ferry,
built by John Stevens in 1811 in Hoboken. But Robert Fulton
in New York challenged his license, and the Supreme Court
eventually settled the matter in the famous Gibbons vs. Ogden
case, which gave Congress the power to regulate interstate
commerce. By 1900, 50 steam ferries crisscrossed the
waterways like clotheslines.
   But the death knell had already sounded. The Brooklyn
Bridge was built in 1883, despite fervid opposition from the
ferrymen, and while the Fulton Ferry to Brooklyn managed to
run until 1924, bridges and tunnels would gradually supplant
the ferries. The Lincoln Tunnel opened in 1937; the Weehawken
Ferry closed in 1959. The "Hudson Tubes," fantastic
5,700-foot train tunnels under the Hudson River, now serving
the PATH train system, were completed in 1908; the plucky
Hoboken ferry held on till 1967.
   The re-ferrying of New York has been quiet and slow, and
not without defeats. Three-and-a-half years ago, two
passenger ferries sprang up almost simultaneously on the
Hudson: Tradebase International's Fort Lee-Wall Street ferry,
and Arcorp's Port Imperial from Weehawken to midtown. The
Fort Lee ferry attracted fewer than 100 riders a week and
closed after four months. Port Imperial gave riders free
passage the first month to build loyalty and word-of-mouth,
and now claims a weekly ridership of 7,000.
   One of the riders is Gilda Natko of Fort Lee. "Thank you
for this boat," she tells Mr. Imperatore as she climbs aboard
the gleaming white vessel with two sea-blue decks, smiling.

   The Numbers Still Add Up in the Wine Country

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Philip Woodward's story is a vintage tale
of boutique wine making by nouveau Californians of the 1970s.
And, while it's too soon to report a happy ending, the smooth
aging of Chalone Inc. belies the downbeat cast of the
domestic industry.
   Mr. Woodward, a Northwestern University MBA, was
transferred to the Bay Area in 1970 by Touche Ross to run a
small-business consultancy. In Detroit previously, he'd
developed an appreciation of the grape, so he gravitated
toward the emerging wineries of his new region. Robert
Mondavi, an early and still prominent figure, was a client.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The most fateful association, however, was with Richard
Graff, a Harvard music major whose family had bought 30 acres
of vines in the mountains above the Salinas Valley. There it
made Chalone wines in a former chicken coop, but Mr. Woodward
had a business plan with bigger ideas. In summer 1972 he quit
the accounting firm, plunging from atop the Alcoa Building
into a basement office on Sutter Street.
   With Mr. Graff as chairman and Mr. Woodward as president
and CEO, Chalone has established itself as an independent but
publicly held producer. Although small ($13 million in annual
sales) in relation to the Gallos of the industry it is one of
only two pure U.S. wine plays in the stock market. (The other
is Canandaigua of New York state.)
   Chalone -- which now also has the Carmenet, Acacia and
Edna Valley wineries in California -- reports a sales rise of
14% in dollar terms, 10% in case volume for the first half of
1990 vs. the 1989 period. This marks a return to strong
growth after stillness last year. Why is the company bucking
the industry trend?
   Because, as Mr. Woodward and other insiders are quick to
suggest, no one trend exists. "I don't think there is a wine
industry anymore, just like there's no real automobile
industry or computer industry anymore," he says. "It's so
segmented." Although the U.S. wine market has declined by
more than 10% since 1986, expensive varietals have continued
steadily upward. Buyers are out there, but the competition is
getting tougher. Gallo is moving upscale in a big way.
Several of the quality California wineries -- Beaulieu,
Beringer, Clos du Bois -- have been bought by big beverage
marketers. Mondavi has teamed with Mouton-Rothschild of
France to produce the Opus One cabernet blend.
   Chalone has a foreign combination of its own, with
Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite), that entails
cross-ownership, shared distribution channels and a $12
Lafite wine to be marketed by Chalone in the U.S. The
alliance is key to Mr. Woodward's plan to expand overseas. He
likens his company to "all the best chateaus in France.
They're already in these markets throughout the world -- why
shouldn't we be?" Sales abroad should account for 7% of the
company's gross this year (up from 1% three years ago) and
Mr. Woodward hopes to hit 20% in five years. Trade barriers
haven't been a significant problem except in Canada, where
the recent liberalization pact should help.
   In the U.S., he looks most to Florida for growth, as the
state attracts affluent retirees from strong Eastern markets.
But California is king, still accounting for 65% of the
company's total volume.
   Yet California may be turning to vinegar for wine
producers. John De Luca, president of the San Francisco-based
Wine Institute, is still grousing about the "reproductive
toxicant" warning signs that the state's Proposition 65
required for alcohol sales, and he's trying to fight another
ballot measure this fall that would impose a $1.29 a gallon
tax on wine (the industry is sponsoring a competing item that
would set a lower levy). But the biggest and most uncertain
political peril is the so-called Big Green initiative, also
in November, to restrict vastly the use of agricultural
chemicals. It could be a corker, as sulfur compounds are
universally used to keep grapes from mildewing on the vines.
   Chalone may be as vulnerable to that latest environmania
as others in the business, but Mr. Woodward finds that as a
top-end seller (80% of his wine this year will retail for
more than $14 a bottle) his operation isn't as susceptible to
per-volume tax hikes and anti-drinking campaigns. Still, it
isn't healthful for the industry to have U.S. per-capita
consumption remain a third or less of that in several
European and South American countries. The entry-level market
matters.
   "New consumers aren't going to start off drinking Chalone
Chardonnay at $25, but they're going to drink white
zinfandel, and hopefully some of those would eventually drink
the products that we make," he says. "I don't think these
labeling laws do anything to help that. A lot of people are
still confused about what `contains sulfites' means."
   However, "consumers who drink our wines are sophisticated
enough to look at that and almost makes jokes of it like they
do in Europe." It's no laughing matter at the French border,
however, where he says such notices are forbidden. For a
while, Chalone blocked out the sulfites warning on every
bottle; now it includes it on a rear label that is omitted
from overseas shipments.
   Foreign standards come into play in another way in Mr.
Woodward's import arrangement. Recently the Food and Drug
Administration began impounding such shipments because a
suspect Japanese fertilizer was used in some French
vineyards. "We can't do anything with it until they do this
long inspection," he beefs.
   He treats the fetal-alcohol syndrome scare more seriously,
admitting "there's a lot of evidence {pregnant women} should
abstain. On the other hand, my wife drank wine right up to
the day she had our twins, and we have two great kids there."
   Generally, Chalone plans to stick to the premium market,
but the Lafite arrangement has given it a stake in a Chilean
winery, a hot source of bargains these days. "You can buy a
cabernet from Chile in the supermarket at $4.99," Mr.
Woodward says. "It's really tough to find anything made in
this country at that price that's anywhere near that quality.
A lot of that's got to be labor costs."
   In-country but out of state, Chalone's found value in 200
acres in Washington's Columbia Valley. The land cost $750 an
acre vs. $15,000 to $25,000 in California, and by 1993 should
be producing a merlot the company will call Canoe Ridge.
   So Chalone will grow in its niche. For Mr. Woodward,
tieless on an average workday but around to pick up the
company phone himself after 6 p.m., it's the payoff from
"knocking on doors" to find the first few hundred investors.
At 51, he claims no desire to sell, saying he doesn't even
pay attention to the capital-gains tax. He'd just like to be
back in the old Folger's Building two blocks down Howard
Street. The company had to flee after last year's earthquake,
but even now in modern surroundings he decries as "like being
in Houston," it's a long way from being a CPA -- and from the
basement. At Touche Ross, "they thought I was absolutely
crazy" to leave. Here's to insanity.

   MILWAUKEE -- Firstar Corp. said it agreed to acquire Banks
of Iowa Inc. in a stock swap valued at about $216 million.
   The acquisition, which requires approval of both banking
concerns' shareholders, would give Firstar the second-biggest
banking presence in Iowa, a state that suffered from the
mid-1980s farm crisis but has since rebounded strongly.
Firstar has assets of about $8.5 billion; Banks of Iowa, Des
Moines, has assets of about $2.5 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earlier this year, Banks of Iowa ended a nearly decade-old
agreement to be acquired by First Bank System Inc.,
Minneapolis, saying it would seek another suitor.
   Under the agreement, Firstar would issue 2.7 common shares
for each of the approximately 2.9 million Banks of Iowa
common shares outstanding. Firstar closed yesterday at $28,
unchanged in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange; Banks of Iowa's shares closed at $68.75, up 75
cents in over-the-counter trading.
   The total price is about 1.2 times Banks of Iowa's June
30, 1990, common equity of $181 million.
   Firstar said it expects to trim data processing and
payroll expenses at the combined banking concerns and boost
Banks of Iowa's income through increased lending and other
services, so that the issuance of new shares won't be
dilutive after 1992.
   Holder meetings are expected this October. Completion of
the transaction should take place after the first of next
year, when Iowa's new interstate banking law becomes
effective.

   Retailing:
   Retailers Use Bans, Guards and Ploys
   To Curb Teen Sport of Mall-Mauling

   It's Saturday afternoon at the Fort Worth Town Center
mall, a time when security guards go on red alert. Suddenly,
three suspicious characters approach the main entrance.
   A burly officer plants himself in front of the ringleader.
"How old are you?" he demands.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Um, 15," says a startled, pale girl in a white T-shirt.
Her two friends are 14 years old. That's enough for the
officers. They swiftly send the would-be shoppers packing,
their ponytails bobbing in the wind.
   Although teen-agers constitute some of its biggest
customers, in June the Fort Worth, Texas, mall began barring
the under-18 set on Saturday afternoons unless an adult comes
along. The reason: juvenile rowdiness. Last year alone,
love-struck teen-age boys started four fistfights over girls.
Others drew retailers' wrath by massing in front of doors and
window displays.
   Town Center isn't alone. Fed up with skateboards thrown
through plate glass, shoplifting and what sometimes seems the
congenital surliness of teens, retailers around the country
are resorting to increasingly extreme measures to control
teen-age shoppers.
   They range from outright bans to subtler means of warfare
-- as convenience stores, for example, try to become less
teen-friendly by removing loitering spots. Some favor the
velvet-glove approach and hire security guards versed in
adolescent psychology.
   But the new tactics carry new dangers. For one thing,
stores risk alienating some of America's biggest spenders:
Last year, adolescents shelled out at least $31 billion on
everything from T-shirts to T-Birds. What's more, some of the
methods raise questions about fairness. Critics charge that
racism plays a part in some of the controls, while others
warn about the dangers of punishing everyone in an age
category for the misbehavior of a few.
   "If a 40-year-old got in a fight, would you ban all
40-year-olds?" asks Robert L. Sorensen, vice president of
property management for Hahn Co., a San Diego-based mall
developer that doesn't endorse any sort of special teen
restrictions.
   The measures strike many youth advocates as particularly
ironic, since mall developers spent millions over the years
trying to recreate a pleasant, Main Street-style atmosphere
that makes shoppers want to congregate. Now that
mall-wandering has replaced cruising the strip as young
America's favorite pastime, it seems the rules are changing.
   "I'm stuck," said David Dawkins, a 15-year-old who was
once a regular visitor to the Fort Worth Town Center. "Where
do they expect me to hang out for the next three years, huh?"
   Nevertheless, jilting kids didn't appear to hurt the Town
Center. Although sales dipped initially, the mall says June
revenue rose about 18%, according to preliminary figures.
Some retailers link their sales rise directly to the
restrictions. Daniel Cetina, the mall's manager, says
teen-agers still come on Saturdays -- but now, they drag
along their parents, who shop as well.
   Even at the Take Ten video arcade, a traditional teen
hangout, where June revenue plummeted 17%, employees aren't
complaining. "I think it's better," says Jeannie Lemley, a
clerk. "Before, the little kids and their parents wouldn't
come in because the big kids wouldn't let them play."
   But some retailers remain unconvinced. "It's dead in
here," grumbles Donnie Vasquez, assistant manager of T-Shirts
Plus, which caters to youthful tastes for Bart Simpson
cartoons and other designs. "I don't think it's fair."
   At ParkFair Mall in Omaha, Neb., the decision to ban
unaccompanied teen-agers every weekday after 2 p.m. was even
easier. Besides fast-food shops, none of ParkFair's stores
target the youth market. Instead, the center's high-end
clothiers have been focusing increasingly on maturing
baby-boomers for sales.
   So earlier this year, when students from nearby Central
High School twice got into fistfights in the food court --
and even injured police officers trying to break up one brawl
--- it was bye-bye brats. "Our customers expect a restaurant
atmosphere, not a cafeteria atmosphere," said Michael Wiese,
vice president of Metro Center Realvest Corp., a unit of
Omaha Development Foundation, which owns ParkFair.
   For malls that do rely heavily on teens for business, the
decision to bar them can be tougher. At Hamburg, N.Y.'s
McKinley Mall, owned by George D. Zamias Inc. of Johnstown,
Pa., retailers resisted any restrictions -- until last
February, when a turf fight erupted among hundreds of
students from rival high schools, leading to more than a
dozen arrests. Now, unescorted youths are prohibited Friday
and Saturday nights.
   As it turned out, McKinley's retailers needn't have
worried: With kids out of the way, adults have begun coming
back to the mall. Except for the game arcade, where sales
plunged 50%, all the other stores have seen revenue jumps of
3% to 8%. "We've brought back the adult person who does spend
the money," says Edward D. Dallape, Zamias's vice president
of operations.
   But many mall owners refuse to resort to such drastic
measures. Some are afraid of bad publicity, while others
worry that bans could be unconstitutional. "You always get
complaints," says Michael Murphy, spokesman for Melvin Simon
&amp; Associates Inc., an Indianapolis shopping center developer.
"You can't exclude a whole sector of your buying public
because of isolated problems from one age group."
   Actually, most bans probably don't violate any laws, since
malls are privately owned, says Colleen O'Connor, a
spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Still, a security program that singles out unruly people
for attention carries its own dangers. Dallas's Red Bird
Mall, owned by Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., was threatened with
a boycott by minorities earlier this summer because,
activists say, guards picked on black and Hispanic kids. Even
minority adults said they got harassed: One black store
manager was asked to leave by a security officer who didn't
recognize him.
   As a result of the protests, Red Bird fired its security
chief, signed up guards for the police department's
sensitivity course and began giving work to minority
contractors. The boycott threat was dropped.
   Other retailers have also found that kinder, gentler
methods work better. Guards at New York-based O'Connor
Group's Singing River Mall in Gautier, Miss., have a new job
title: "Ambassadors of Good Will." It's a similar story at
North Mountain Village in Phoenix, Ariz. There, William Moody
-- property manager for the owner, Western Investment
Management Co. in Cupertino, Calif. -- makes it a point, when
talking to kids, to roll up his sleeves to reveal
skateboarding scars. "Afterwards, they're not terrorizing the
site -- just sort of hanging out in front of the Burger
King," he says.
   Randall Park Mall in North Randall, Ohio, and Regency Mall
in Augusta, Ga., both owned by DeBartolo, take the
friendly-watchdog concept one step further. They hire local
youths to walk around, cut off rowdiness and aid confused
shoppers. The job calls for them to be perky and "full of
smiles," says Lynn Pace, Regency Mall assistant manager.
   Corny though it sounds, such co-opting seems to work, Ms.
Pace says. A teen who goes to Randall Park Mall every weekend
said she finds the center's "hospitality teams" more helpful
than annoying. "They're kind of half teacher's pets, but once
you get to know them, they're OK," says Dawn Winguard, 17.
   Meanwhile, a few of Southland Corp.'s 7-Eleven stores have
removed window ledges and flat-topped trash cans used as
perches by young loiterers. Others modified their pay phones
so they don't ring; that prevents kids from hanging around
and taking calls.
   And Canadian 7-Elevens have gone one step better. Ten
outlets there blast syrupy tunes like "Moon River" to scare
away teens.

   Reebok Accord
   May Slow Spiral
   For Higher Paid

   Is the executive pay spiral slowing?
   It could be.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Compensation specialists say Paul Fireman's startling pay
cut at Reebok International Ltd. could create a ripple effect
in other boardrooms.
   Reebok's chairman and chief executive officer has been one
of the most visible beneficiaries of the past decade's boom
in corporate largess. His pay has averaged $13.6 million a
year over the past four years. But at the end of July, a new
five-year contract capped Mr. Fireman's annual cash payment
at $2 million-$1 million in salary and a bonus of as much as
$1 million, depending on Reebok's profit performance.
   Many companies in recent years have been edging toward
using more stock and less cash to compensate top executives,
and Mr. Fireman's example could speed that trend along. While
the chief executive gets a huge stock-option grant under his
new contract, Reebok has made it tougher than usual to profit
on those options. For Mr. Fireman just to match his earnings
under his previous contract, which paid him a percentage of
corporate net income, the company's stock price would have to
grow at nearly twice the average rate for companies in
general, analysts and compensation experts estimate.
   "Ten years ago, we saw performance plans in which
performance could be readily reached," says an
executive-compensation specialist at Union Pacific Corp.
"Today, companies are willing to pay more to get more." Mr.
Fireman, who with his wife owns 15% of the footwear concern's
stock, declined repeated requests for interviews, and a
Reebok spokeswoman wouldn't comment.
   One reason the highly visible switch by Reebok is expected
to be influential is that compensation negotiations will soon
be starting at companies across the country. "There's a great
deal of me-tooism in executive compensation," says Gordon
Wolf, a vice president at consultants Towers Perrin.
   Alan Johnson, compensation specialist at recruiters Handy
Associates, agrees. "The pressure is continuing to increase"
to tie executives' compensation more closely to corporate
performance, he says, adding: "No one wants to show up on a
list of overpaid executives."
   The Reebok situation, to be sure, has some elements
peculiar to it. Reebok's growth has slowed considerably as
rival Nike Inc. has overtaken it. And compensation experts
see the shift in Mr. Fireman's package as the normal passage
of a small, entrepreneurial venture into the world of
big-company compensation. While profit-sharing arrangements
are common at smaller ventures, only a few larger ones --
like Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner Inc. -- offer them.
   "Fireman is moving from a position of uniqueness to one
that is more normal," says Graef Crystal, a compensation
specialist and adjunct professor of business administration
at the Haas School of Business, University of California at
Berkeley. En route, consultants note, Mr. Fireman's pay pact
was modified once before, to cut the share of corporate
profit to which he was entitled.
   Still, compensation consultants maintain that Reebok's
previous pay package presented several problems of a kind
that companies are increasingly under pressure to correct.
Among them:
   -- Out-of-Proportion Pay: Many feel that a highly
controversial $550 million bonus -- based on a percentage of
profit -- to Drexel Burnham Lambert junk-bond specialist
Michael Milken marked a psychological turning point for many
companies. "People looked at what happened with Mike Milken,
who had a formula that never was changed, and said we can't
let that happen here," says Mr. Johnson of Handy. While Mr.
Fireman's case was by no means that extreme, Mr. Johnson
calls it a "well-intentioned formula being distorted by the
great success of the company."
   -- Drain on Corporate Cash: Gary M. Jacobson, an analyst
at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., estimates that Mr. Fireman's new
pay package will save the company about six cents a share
compared with his previous pact. In today's austere climate,
"people are acutely sensitive to the money people make on
annual pay," Mr. Johnson says. By contrast, he adds: "There's
not very much sensitivity to equity. There's no rumbling at
all about the billions Bill Gates has made {through
appreciation of the stock he owns} at Microsoft."
   -- Paying for Low Performance: Although most companies say
their pay plan pays for performance, in practice it often
doesn't work out that way. Because he shared in corporate
profit above a certain threshold, Mr. Fireman took home huge
bonuses even when corporate results soured. Reebok's stock
price has been flat over the past several years, and in 1988,
when earnings dropped 17%, Mr. Fireman's bonus dropped, too
-- to $11.1 million from $15.1 million.
   One novel aspect of Mr. Fireman's new pay package that
compensation experts see creeping into other plans is the use
of so-called premium-priced stock options. Stock options give
the right to purchase a share of stock in the future at a
price fixed today. Normally, that price is the market price
on the date the option is granted. Sometimes, options are
even granted at a discount to market price, giving executives
a potential profit right away.
   The 2.5 million options granted under Mr. Fireman's new
contract, however, have exercise prices an average of 18%
higher than Reebok's current market price.
   Mr. Crystal at Berkeley figures that to match the previous
bonus arrangement, Mr. Fireman would have to preside over a
stock-price appreciation exceeding 24% a year for the 10
years the options are exercisable. Since World War II, he
notes, the compounded return on stocks in general has been
about 14%.
   Some other companies have also added similar strict
provisions. Under a 10-year contract that expires in 1998,
Michael Eisner, chairman of Disney, gets options on two
million shares, 500,000 of them priced at $10 above the
market price on the date they were granted.
   At Union Pacific, an executive-incentive program begins to
pay off only after the stock price hits $100, nearly double
its value when the plan was designed. "It's a very ambitious
plan," says the Union Pacific compensation official. "We
looked for a program that had a high performance hurdle."
   Compensation specialists say they hope others will follow.
Giving premium options "sends a powerful signal to the
investment community" about a company's expectations for
growth, asserts Louis Brindisi Jr., chairman of Strategic
Compensation Associates.
   "I'd like to see more of it," says Mr. Crystal.
   Still, many expect a slow, painful process. "We are
passing the castor-oil bottle," Mr. Crystal adds. "This is
not a nice goodie." Others note that when companies adopt
unusual or risky pay provisions, they are often simply
additions to existing programs, not replacements. That is
true at Union Pacific, where the company also offers
traditional stock options.

   The world changed last week. A grandiose Middle East
dictator took control -- not just of a neighboring sheikdom,
but of the West's economic destiny in the 1990s.
   Saddam Hussein, an insular leader who has had almost no
contact with the Western world, nonetheless appears to have
read the West's aversion to military involvement with
unerring accuracy. Indeed, President Bush took four days even
to suggest forcing the eviction of Iraqi invaders from Kuwait
-- and to dispatch his secretary of defense to Saudi Arabia
to seek "permission" to protect that country. The Iraqi
leader effectively has what he wants, for now -- the ability
to dictate world oil prices through the occupation or
intimidation of major Middle East oil producers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The West is congratulating itself on a rare show of
rhetorical unity, is pledging boycotts of Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil
and is making feeble noises about resisting Iraqi aggression
against "vital interests" in Saudi Arabia, the world's
largest repository of oil. But it all looks to be too little
too late.
   Our vital interest is not merely some particular piece of
Middle East real estate. It is the free flow of oil at
tolerable prices. And that already has been lost. Regaining
it is entirely possible -- but only with patience,
persistence and, yes, military power. It is false comfort to
believe that if Saddam Hussein stops at Kuwait, the problem
has been contained. Saddam Hussein certainly is smart enough
to know that he doesn't need to invade Saudi Arabia to
dictate its oil policy; his invasion of Kuwait and the
absence thus far of a serious Western response ensures that
Saudi King Fahd meekly will follow Iraq's line on oil
production and pricing. Saddam is the wolf and Fahd the
sheep. But it is Western consumers who will wind up being
slaughtered.
   Just as Western leaders in the late 1930s deluded
themselves in believing that Adolf Hitler's ambitions could
be bought off with one more little piece of Central Europe,
the West today deludes itself in believing that Saddam
Hussein's ambitions end with Kuwait. Whether he chooses to
gobble another oil sheikdom now or later, the Iraqi leader
has an ambition: to rule the Middle East through military
threat, political intimidation and economic might. Barring
Western military action, little stands in his way. Saddam
Hussein used $50 billion in Kuwaiti and Saudi loans over the
past decade to buy weapons he now uses against Kuwait. In
coming years he will use Western money extorted for oil to
buy weapons he uses against future victims.
   A West that can't seem to learn the military lessons of
Munich now at least has the possibility of reordering its
flabby political and economic priorities. To begin with,
Americans ought to dispense with the illusion that we now
live in a kinder, gentler world. A multi-polar world with
regional aggressions unrestrained by superpower influence is
going to be a more dangerous and violent age. The end of the
Cold War, in short, will be the beginning of an era of Hot
Wars. One need only watch the Soviets flapping in rhetorical
chorus with the West over Iraq's aggression to realize that
superpower amity has little effect on regional enmity.
   As the president and Congress continue to argue over the
degree to which the military budget should be slashed, all
parties owe the American people a greater degree of honesty.
Those seeking to decimate the defense budget ought to at
least grant that it will make America's response to actions
like Saddam Hussein's not just improbable but impossible.
   Those, like the president and the Pentagon, who argue for
maintaining military strength legitimately can be asked the
question: Under what circumstances do you ever intend to use
military force? If the military's purpose is to protect
America's vital national interests, surely those amount to
more than rescuing a few score Americans in a Liberian coup.
   Military analysts talk of the year it would take to
assemble a ground defense of Saudi Arabia. What, one wonders,
has the Pentagon been doing during the 1980s? If the
proponents of maintaining military strength are correct --
and they are -- then the U.S. response cannot be to wallow in
the experience of Vietnam. If $300 billion buys us a military
capability that truly cannot be employed, then the U.S. would
be better off following the Japanese example and using that
sum to "buy" friends and bribe adversaries.
   That's no policy for a great power. But the sad truth in
today's Washington is that the distinction between doves and
hawks comes down to a choice between low-cost or high-cost
appeasement.
   In the end, the question is this: what, if not the West's
oil supplies, constitutes a vital national interest? Lest we
forget, it was only 17 years ago that Americans fumed in long
gas lines and the country believed itself hostage to Mideast
oil producers' whims. In 1974, only about 12.3% of America's
oil imports came from the OPEC countries. That figure is now
about 28%.
   It may not be part of Saddam Hussein's agenda to put
Americans back in the gas lines. But almost surely it is
within his power. In a recent interview with this newspaper,
the Iraqi leader stated that it was his policy to raise the
price of oil in order to acquire funds to rebuild his
war-exhausted economy. He also said he wanted to acquire
sophisticated weaponry sufficient at least to equal Israel.
   Noting that the price of oil was around $14 a barrel, the
president in late June said "this does not represent half of
the real value of the oil price in 1971. Who is responsible
for this injustice? They are some of the Western states and
some of my friends in the region who do not see beyond their
noses. . . . No one can rule out using the economy or the
role of his economy to defend himself."
   The West mustn't delude itself about Saddam Hussein's
grand design: dominating oil prices is but a means to
dominating the Middle East. He is no Mideast madman to be
cowed by threats, bought off by bribes or grudgingly
tolerated as a Gadhafi-like nuisance. He is shrewd,
calculating, relentless and ruthless. Most important, he is
vain and amoral, unchecked by any internal or external
inhibitions. He is loyal only to himself. For instance, his
friend and supporter, Jordan's King Hussein, who visited
Baghdad less than 24 hours before the Kuwaiti invasion, was
unwittingly dispatched home to call Mr. Bush and assure him
Saddam Hussein had no intention of military action against
Kuwait.
   Over the next days and weeks the world is likely to see
more evidence of Saddam Hussein's calculating character.
Almost certainly, he and his new Kuwaiti puppets will
continue to round up foreigners -- Americans, British, French
-- and threaten their lives if the West seeks to retaliate.
Saddam understands, far better than Americans, the degree to
which Western policy can be made hostage to hostages.
   Saddam may even eventually pull some substantial portion
of his forces out of Kuwait. But the Iraqi leader plays for
the long term. He survived an eight-year war with Iran
because he cares nothing for the human costs to his people.
He will count on outlasting any short-term show of Western
resolve.
   To a journalist who has spent substantial time in Saudi
Arabia over the past decade, the Saudi reaction in coming
months is fully predictable -- as was Saudi unwillingness
even to condemn strongly the invasion of a fraternal
sheikdom. The Saudi royal family, which numbers some 4,000
princes, has presided over its vast oil reserves by having
only one policy -- an insurance policy that pays protective
premiums to every tough-guy or terrorist in the region. It is
a policy that hopes for the benefits of an American security
blanket without paying the political price of allowing an
American military presence in the kingdom. It is the same
policy that the Kuwaitis pursued. If the Saudis persist, they
almost surely will come to the same end.
   The one safe assumption about Saudi reaction these days is
that the princes are fueling their private planes and further
feathering their overseas bank accounts, while whispering to
Saddam Hussein that they will defer to him on oil prices.
   For the U.S., the point is not to be deceived by Saddam
Hussein's cunning, deterred by Saudi Arabia's cowardice or
distracted by the inevitably vain search for unified Western
action. America has simply to pursue its own interest -- the
free flow of oil at acceptable prices.
   Saddam Hussein now controls oil prices. He must be forced
out of Kuwait and the U.S. must demonstrate its staying power
in the region to preclude future Iraqi intimidation of major
Mideast oil producers. The U.S. must immediately institute a
naval blockade of Iraq, which is the only way to enforce at
least a partially effective boycott of Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil. A
fully effective embargo would require disrupting pipelines
that carry the flow of Iraqi oil through Saudi Arabia and
Turkey. These nations should act immediately to stop those
flows. Anticipating this, Iraq has already sharply reduced
the flow of oil to Turkish pipelines. It is possible Saudi
Arabia might be persuaded by Defense Secretary Richard Cheney
to shut the flow through its country.
   Surely, given American air and naval dominance, this level
of immediate military confrontation is feasible and
sustainable. The U.S. is, after all, a nation that once was
willing to institute a naval blockade of Cuba in the face of
Soviet threats of nuclear Armageddon. It is a nation that was
willing to maintain a 15-month military airlift to
beleaguered Berlin. If the rest of the Western world wishes
to assist the U.S. that is good -- but America can't make its
interests hostage to the absence of a Western consensus.
   It is of course true that an effective blockade of Iraq
would remove 20% of the world's oil production from the
market, driving prices higher and making a recession more
likely. So be it. American consumers are going to pay higher
prices for their gasoline one way or another. Better to pay
that price as a temporary byproduct of stopping Saddam
Hussein than to pay it in perpetual ransom to a tyrant
holding the global economy hostage.
   The time has come to present the Saudis with a simple and
realistic ultimatum: Accept an American military presence
immediately or an Iraqi military domination down the road.
Minimally, the Saudis ought to allow U.S. naval and air
forces to use Saudi ports and airfields and to permit the
prepositioning of materiel for a possible land defense of the
kingdom.
   If the Saudis decline U.S. help now, it will make their
own demise that much more likely. It also will make U.S.
military intervention in the region that much more difficult
-- but in the end, no less inevitable. For all of today's
flapping and dawdling, for all the concern over diplomatic
niceties and military difficulties, the handwriting is on the
wall. Whether this month, next year or somewhere in the
1990s, this country will conclude that the world's oil
supplies and its own economic destiny simply cannot be
subject to the whim of a single Middle East despot. The U.S.
will have to act for its own self-preservation.

   As a right-leaning radical centrist, permit me to question
the validity of Albert R. Hunt's July 11 editorial-page
column, "Without the Glue, the Conservatives Are Balkanized."
   While some conservatives and neocons do, indeed, seem
momentarily disoriented by the apparent collapse of the
Empire of the Commiczars, they will soon rediscover their
primal "glue," as Mr. Hunt calls their (and my own)
anti-socialist instincts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This will happen, is happening. Simply because the left's
communoid dream of "True Socialism" is alive and
well-pretending, of course, that it will now succeed because
it has never before been tried.
   In its attempt to rise from the ashes, TruSoc (as George
Orwell might have called it) will slowly become recognized as
the neo-enemy, perhaps not as overtly criminal but just as
insidiously dangerous as communism itself. Here is the story
in geopolitical rhyme and verse:
                                                                                                       

   Conservatives like us, they say
   Have lost our cause and primal glue;
   For due to communism's fall,
   We have no further good to do.
                                                                                                       

   But hark] Our noble cause remains,
   While leftist pseudo-libs do try
   To resurrect from Lenin's grave
   The "Dream" they hope will never die.
                                                                                                       

   That Dream, called Socialism True,
   Is now reborn, the left does claim.
   For communism's heinous crimes,
   The Dream, they say, was ne'er to blame.
                                                                                                       

   The left would socialize us all --
   Intent to fill each space and void
   With stuff so very Lenin-like,
   It looks and smells like "communoid."
                                                                                                       

   So now, the Cold War does resume
   Twixt us and reborn Socialism,
   Whose cause the left does now promote
   As neo-Marxist Gorbachism.

   TOKYO -- Sales of imported cars, trucks and buses in Japan

year earlier, the Japan Automobile Importers' Association
said. The results mark a record for the month and the 79th
consecutive month of year-to-year increases.
   Import sales have been rising since January 1984. Though
17% growth is high, an association official said,
year-to-year increases have been below 20% so far this year,
which could make it impossible to reach the association's
target of selling 240,000 units in 1990. Japanese dealers
sold 180,000 imported vehicles in 1989.

   Those evil Democrats] With their "sonic boom of elation"
at the president's change of lips, they gave your editorial
writer an apoplectic attack ("Lipping It Up," June 28). I am
sure that the resulting high blood pressure blurred his
vision and he didn't notice that, in his written statement,
the president never bothered to admit that he duped the
American people and is now hiding behind the "bipartisan
leadership."
   To write that "the Democratic Party exists now for the
purpose of raising taxes" is sheer demagoguery. Anyway, if
the Democrats are not going to raise taxes and generate
revenue, how are you going to pay for all the B-2s that
George Bush wants to build, the new fighter planes, Star Wars
deployment, etc., etc.? How are you going to take care of all
those S&amp;L payments that will come due over the next 30 years?
Cut Medicare you say? Well, I don't know. There are thousands
of doctors out there, hundreds of businesses running
hospitals; they make a good living off Medicare and they
probably vote Republican.

   I think you have a problem. And you can't let the deficit

What to do? How about joining the Democrats in writing a

more defense scandals. Simple, isn't it?

   I knew Eire, or the Republic of Ireland, or simply Ireland
as it is more commonly known, prided itself on its neutrality
but I wasn't aware that it had seceded or been expelled from
"Europe."
   Writing on the July 3 Leisure &amp; Arts page, Nicholas King
proclaims that Spain's Cape Finisterre is "the westernmost
point of Europe" ("Mobile Guide: Celtic Touch on the Coast of
Spain"). A quick check of some handy maps in my appointment
calendar (and not, I must confess, bona fide nautical charts)
confirmed my gut reaction that Cape Blasket Island off
Ireland's Dingle peninsula lies about 10 degrees, 34 minutes
West vs. Cape Finisterre's nine degrees, 20 minutes West
longitude. As long as we're talking "islands," what about the
Canary Islands (17 degrees, 20 minutes West)? Although
technically off the African coast, they are politically part
of European Spain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   OK, if you want to stay in Europe and don't want to count
"little" islands, then the tip of the Dingle peninsula lies
only a few minutes of longitude east of Blasket. I would
almost agree if Mr. King had modified his description to "the
westernmost point of mainland Europe," although the Cabo de
Roca, southwest of Lisbon probably would challenge Finisterre
to make that claim -- that is if Portugal hasn't seceded from
Europe.
   Assuming that we want to stay with inhabited places, or at
the very least places that one could or would ever want to
visit, I suppose that eliminates that spit of rock -- ever
the subject of Anglo/Irish debate -- Rockall. Alas, however,
Icelanders might take exception, as their homeland has --
from time to time -- been considered a European country.
   Perhaps by now some of Mr. King's colleagues at the
Foreign Press Center have pointed out the abyss one falls
into when one makes "ultimate" geography claims.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)

<LP>
   Last week, a federal judge invalidated the first-place
primary showing of Sarah Flores, who was favored to win a
November runoff and become the first Hispanic or woman ever
to serve on the powerful Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors. After months of campaigning, she must now start
over and campaign in a court-ordered district that excludes
her hometown and 75% of the voters who backed her.
   Amazingly, Federal Judge David Kenyon first declared the
existing districts invalid in June on the grounds that "an
Hispanic is unable to be elected to the board" under them.
"Judge Kenyon issued that ruling the day before I won 68% of
the Hispanic vote, came in first with Anglo voters and
carried 29 out of 31 cities," says Mrs. Flores. "If I'm not
living proof an Hispanic can win, what is?"
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The truth is the Flores case has a lot more to do with
politics than civil rights. Mrs. Flores may be Hispanic, but
to the local ACLU chapter and the other liberal groups that
filed a civil-rights suit to overturn the district lines she
is the wrong kind of Hispanic. She happens to be a
Republican. Her election would continue a 3-to-2 conservative
majority on the Board of Supervisors. Under the district
lines ordered by Judge Kenyon, the election of a third
liberal Democrat is more or less assured.
   After his June ruling that the district lines
discriminated against Hispanics, Judge Kenyon had three
choices. First, he could have allowed the November election
to take place in a district already 49% Hispanic, with Mrs.
Flores the likely winner. New districts would then have been
drawn using 1990 Census data. The board could even have been
expanded from five to seven districts, from which two
Hispanics might have been elected.
   Alternately, Judge Kenyon could have accepted any one of
six district plans drawn by redistricting expert Bernard
Grofman at the behest of the U.S. Justice Department. All six
included a district that was at least 71% Hispanic. One would
have kept the Flores district more or less intact, and
offered Hispanics a chance to be the deciding vote in two
additional districts. However, the Justice Department
undercut that plan by saying it was flawed for having placed
two Anglo supervisors in the same district. "I'm amused that
in a `civil-rights' case everyone put the interests of an
Anglo male incumbent before those of an Hispanic female,"
Mrs. Flores says. And since when did the government begin to
interpret the Voting Rights Act as protecting the interests
of incumbents?
   In the end, Judge Kenyon, a Jimmy Carter appointee,
rejected all six Justice plans and ordered new elections in
November under lines drawn by the liberal Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), a plaintiff in
the case. The new MALDEF district actually has a lower
Hispanic population than most of the six Justice plans, and
is more grotesquely configured. However, it does create a
third safe Democratic seat. It's as if a sign had been put
up: No Hispanic Republican Need Apply.
   Sarah Flores says she has always beaten tough odds and
promises to run for the new seat. She worked her way out of
poverty by starting as a secretary in county government more
than 30 years ago, eventually rising to become a $63,000 a
year top deputy to a county supervisor. To run for supervisor
she had to quit her job, take out a loan on her house, and
raise more than $400,000 as a first-time candidate.
   But the fate of Sarah Flores is not the major issue here.
It is the working assumption by most of the parties involved
that minority voters can be represented only by someone with
a liberal ideology who is a product of an urban Democratic
Party machine.
   Anyone breaking out of the Liberal Barrio or Plantation
with a different perspective must be, like Sarah Flores or
Bill Lucas before her, crushed politically. The message sent
to others is: If you want to serve in government, toe the
liberal line. Otherwise, you will be tarred as disloyal to
your ethnic group.
   Three federal judges have agreed to hear an appeal and
render a quick decision on the Los Angeles case. We hope they
reject Judge Kenyon's odd argument that the likely election
of an Hispanic candidate should be canceled so that a
different Hispanic can win. The redrawing of district lines
should facilitate democracy, not serve as a back-door means
to frustrate the will of the people.

   There's at least one silver lining to the tumult in the
Middle East over Saddam Hussein's takeover of Kuwait. For
awhile, we don't have to endure yet more press accounts and
official pronouncements about how the West Bank is the source
of all the problems that attend this region. After the sands
fold over the Iraq problem, it'll be interesting to see if
this small strip of land re-emerges to dominate thinking
about the area.

   Arguing Against NEA Isn't Censorship

   As a theatrical historian who enjoys all the arts, I can
share Edwin Wilson's contempt for political and religious
extremists who would censor what we read or watch, but I am
dismayed when he concludes his essay with the observation
that "debating whether we should have an NEA at all . . . is
a wrongheaded exercise in demagoguery" ("In Search of an
Authentic Debate," Leisure &amp; Arts, June 29). Battling
censorship ought to be a duty for every decentminded citizen;
advocating that taxpayers be forced to underwrite the arts
(and saying the subject is not open to legitimate discussion)
is quite another matter. There are good and proper arguments
for closing down the National Endowment for the Arts.
   In American theater from the plays of Eugene O'Neill or
George S. Kaufman and the musicals of Victor Herbert or
Jerome Kern through the later masterpieces of Tennessee
Williams and Richard Rodgers, producers and their private
investors could bank on reasonable assurances that playgoers
lining up at the box office would give them a handsome
profit. When films from "Birth of a Nation" on to more recent
blockbusters could not be financed from a studio or
producer's earlier earnings, banks were happy to lend money,
again feeling confident that public response would lock in a
return on their investment. Book buyers saw to it that
publishers of favorites from Twain to Michener kept ledgers
in black ink.

   True, in other countries in other times enlightened
princes often harbored and nurtured fine talent. But that has
not been nor should it be the American way. In fact, it is
not a truly analogous situation.
   Somerset Maugham once wrote something to the effect that
the classics in any field are culled from bygone, popular
successes. Discovery of an Emily Dickinson is extremely rare.
So why not let book buyers, concertgoers, theater lovers and
kindred souls in the other arts decide with their purchases
what they want to see and what therefore should be offered.
Bureaucrats doling out support to self-indulgent eccentrics
is a waste of time and money. Who needs islands covered with
plastic sheeting, five-hour-long operas and pictures of
religious figures bathed in urine? Or do I hear a cry for
government underwriting to revive Restoration masques?

   What can Mr. Wilson mean by a "vigorous, informed debate"
that prohibits the mention of abolition? It is all too easy
to label one's philosophical opponents "demagogues" and avoid
facing fundamental questions about the role of government in
the arts by ridiculing the likes of Sen. Jesse Helms and the
Rev. Pat Robertson.
   As we say to the neighborhood bullies, Mr. Wilson, pick on
somebody your own size. Well-meaning people in high places
who would like to test their philosophical and moral
foundations on this issue before lumping us together with
Messrs. Helms and Robertson might search out representatives
of that (very small) minority of us in the arts who oppose
forcing others to support our chosen and privileged
profession.

   Gulf Crisis Catches Car Makers Pushing Larger Models

   DETROIT -- The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the resulting
jump in gasoline prices couldn't have come at a worse time
for car makers, particularly the Big Three.
   The sudden return of recession fears, oil embargo threats
and accelerating gasoline prices is catching product planners
at American and Japanese auto makers leaning the wrong way --
toward bigger, more powerful and less fuel-efficient cars and
trucks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Detroit's cars are far more efficient than the gas
guzzlers of a decade ago, but Japanese auto makers still have
the edge if American consumers become mileage-conscious
again.
   Japanese car makers have the advantage not just in raw
miles-per-gallon numbers. They also have used their lead in
small engine technology to develop four-cylinder cars that
have the pep of an American six-cylinder. In short, they can
offer consumers more models that blend economy and
performance.
   What's more, Japanese car companies have quicker product
cycles than their U.S. rivals and thus could respond faster
to market changes or renewed regulatory pressure to cut
reliance on imported oil by raising fuel economy standards,
industry analysts say.
   "Everybody is in better shape than 10 years ago," says
analyst Christopher Cedergren of J.D. Power &amp; Associates, a
market research firm. "But the Japanese still are in better
shape than the American manufacturers."
   A slowdown in the U.S. economy also could give Japanese
car makers an even larger share of the U.S. market. "You'd
not only have a decline in total vehicle sales but you'd have
a bias toward smaller cars," said David Healy, an analyst
with Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
   A shift toward smaller cars could be particularly damaging
to General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., which derive much
of their profits from big cars. GM and Ford each spent
millions of dollars recently to restyle their large,
low-mileage, rear-wheel drive cars so they could remain
competitive -- and add to the corporate bottom line -- well
into the 1990s.
   Although gasoline prices surged after last week's invasion
of Kuwait by Iraq, it is still unclear what longer-term
impact the gulf crisis will have on prices and supplies. But
whatever happens, policy makers, already concerned about the
high use of imported oil, will have a stronger argument to
demand tougher automobile fuel economy standards.
   The car industry has been backsliding on fuel economy for
the past two years. After greatly improving between 1975 and
1988, the mileage of the average car dropped to 27.8 miles
per gallon in the current model year from 28.6 miles per
gallon in 1988, according to a study by the federal
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Japanese car makers accounted for much of that drop, the
EPA found. A decade ago, Japanese manufacturers sold almost
entirely small, fuel-sipping economy cars. But now, Honda
Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Corp. and some of
the smaller Japanese companies all are offering larger, more
powerful models in an effort to push into the mainstream of
the U.S. market.
   Nissan and Toyota unveiled luxury cars this past fall with
V-8 engines more powerful than any offered by Cadillac or
Lincoln. Toyota's 250-horsepower Lexus LS 400 gets 18 miles
to the gallon in city driving. That's only slightly better
than the 17 miles to the gallon achieved by the larger
Lincoln Town Car.
   But while the Japanese were pushing into the larger car
market, they also continued to refine their four-cylinder
engine technology.
   Consider the Toyota Camry and the Ford Taurus. The Camry's
four-cylinder base engine has 115 horsepower and delivers 26
miles per gallon in city driving. The Taurus's four-cylinder
base engine has a mere 90 horsepower and delivers only 20
miles per gallon in the city.
   U.S. auto makers have concentrated most of their new
product development efforts on building better six- and
eight-cylinder engines, says Mr. Cedergren.
   To be sure, Detroit has some products it could throw into
the breach. GM has a multi-valve, four-cylinder engine
similar to those found on many Japanese cars. And late this
fall, the No. 1 auto maker is scheduled to launch its new
Saturn line of compact cars that are expected to match
Japanese levels of performance and fuel economy.
   Ford, meanwhile, recently unveiled the new Ford Escort, a
subcompact jointly engineered with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp.
The high-mileage Escort has had disappointing sales, but that
could change if gasoline prices continue to rise.
   Chrysler Corp. continues to offer many cars powered by
four-cylinder engines. But the company's fortunes hinge in
large part on its minivans, most of which are powered by V-6
engines and get relatively low mileage.
   Even if the Persian Gulf quiets down in the next few
weeks, Detroit may still have reason to worry. Congress isn't
likely to act in this session to boost fuel economy
standards, but the sudden focus on the country's dependence
on foreign oil could ease the way for tougher regulation.
   Says top Chrysler lobbyist Robert Liberatore: "I could see
this whole mess in the Middle East raising the hue and cry
for conservation."

   IBM Plans to Unveil Several New Models
   Of Popular AS/400 Minicomputer Line

   International Business Machines Corp. plans to unveil on
Aug. 21 several new models of its popular AS/400
minicomputer, a product that continues to defy gloomy
predictions, according to industry consultants.
   The new models will be clustered at the low end of the
AS/400 family, the consultants said. They will be easier to
use than previous AS/400s, because IBM also plans to
introduce a new version of the minicomputer's operating
system.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since its introduction in 1988, the AS/400 has become a
runaway success that contributes about $13 billion a year to
IBM's revenue, producing more than $1 billion in profit,
consultants said. Revenue from the product line increased 19%
in 1989. In the first half of 1990, it grew at a double-digit
rate again, IBM said last week, despite some analysts' fears
that it had started to hit roadblocks.
   Nonetheless, the low end of the family has consistently
underperformed IBM's higher-priced AS/400s. Thus, this
month's announcement, which will include an entry-level
minicomputer priced in the $10,000 range, should cheer
skeptics.
   Consultants said the easy-to-use machines may help attract
users of a previous IBM minicomputer, the System/36. So far,
System/36 users have resisted moving to the AS/400 because
its operation is more complex and transferring software can
be difficult.
   For these prospective customers, identified by consultants
as a potential $20 billion market, the new operating system
will ease users through the more complex aspects of the
AS/400. It also will make connecting to other computers,
including non-IBM machines, easier.
   For entry-level minicomputer users, IBM plans to offer a
new version of its AS/Entry, a machine that uses System/36
technology and is incompatible with the rest of the AS/400
family. Unlike its predecessor, however, this computer looks
the same as other AS/400s, and can be upgraded to a regular
AS/400 by replacing a few circuit boards.
   IBM also will announce the availability of a speedy,
high-capacity disk drive for all models of the AS/400. These
new drives will replace a slower drive that accounted for at
least $3 billion in revenue last year, said consultant David
Andrews of ADM Inc., Cheshire, Conn.
   The disk drive was announced in February for use in IBM's
new RS/6000 workstations. "It's quite exciting technology,
and it's very big business," said Mr. Andrews. Another
technological advance last seen in the RS/6000 -- the
four-megabit memory chip -- will also make its AS/400 debut
on Aug. 21, he added.
   An IBM spokeswoman confirmed that the Armonk, N.Y.,
computer giant will make several AS/400 announcements that
will focus on the low end "in the very near future," but
declined to give details.
   In an interview last week, Robert LaBant, the new general
manager of IBM's minicomputer operation, also refused to be
specific about the new products. But he and other IBM
executives were unreservedly upbeat about the prospects for
the AS/400, which they said is now entering its "growth
phase."
   "We have tremendous demand," Mr. LaBant said. "We're all
working overtime. . . . Demand is going to stay very high."
   Mr. LaBant and the other executives sketched out an
impressive first half for the AS/400, which they said
achieved double-digit growth in both revenue and units in the
U.S. World-wide, the AS/400 recorded only single-digit unit
growth, but revenue grew in double digits because sales were
skewed toward the high end. They added that in both the first
and second quarters, AS/400 shipments were
"supply-constrained," meaning machines weren't produced fast
enough to fill orders.
   Sales to sites with more than one AS/400 also have done
well, with the installed base doubling since September. Mr.
LaBant said one customer -- identified by consultants as
Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. -- is
installing "hundreds of AS/400s a month." An Allstate
spokeswoman said she couldn't confirm the report.
   Such numbers suggest the AS/400, which many analysts have
predicted will be outflanked by personal computers and
workstations such as the RS/6000, has a long way to go before
it's declared dead.

   Congressman Stark apologized to Dr. Sullivan last Friday,
one day after his racialist outburst, and if this were merely
an isolated incident we'd leave it at that. But Mr. Stark has
opened a window on liberalism's Shoal Creek Country Club.
This deserves further inspection.
   In recent weeks, of course, all of America has read about
Shoal Creek, the Birmingham, Alabama, country club that says
it doesn't exclude blacks but never got around to admitting
any. This scrutiny of country-club culture is fine by us and
the controversy has been a step toward greater racial
harmony. But next on the list should be the form of
discrimination expressed by Mr. Stark: That the only good
blacks are liberal blacks. Whites can think for themselves,
but blacks (and other minorities) had better think like Pete
Stark or they're a "disgrace" to their race.
   Consider the context of Mr. Stark's attack on Dr.
Sullivan. He uttered the tirade at a routine news conference
announcing a new health-care proposal. In the midst of
attacking Dr. Sullivan's opposition to national health
insurance (a pet Stark idea) and to abortion, he slipped
easily and thoughtlessly into the racial jibe. His crack was
so unconscious and sincere it brought to mind former Los
Angeles Dodger official Al Campanis on "Nightline."
   Even after Dr. Sullivan demanded an apology on Thursday,
Mr. Stark failed to understand his slight. He replied to a
reporter: "He's right. He doesn't live on my plantation. He
lives on White House Chief of Staff John Sununu's plantation.
He is indeed a sad and pathetic figure." Only the next day,
after his attack was denounced by both the White House and
members of Congress, did Mr. Stark say he "blew it" by
bringing race into his disagreement.
   Dr. Sullivan's offense, of course, isn't conformity at
all, especially since Cabinet secretaries are supposed to
implement White House policy. His sin is independent
thinking. Dr. Sullivan has recently been giving thoughtful
speeches on health and social issues that don't comport with
the liberal stereotype of how a black public official should
act.
   Unlike many black leaders, he's bravely attacked black
nationalist Louis Farrakhan for "anti-Semitic rhetoric" that
is "shameful, outrageous and stupid." He often speaks about
building a new "culture of character" in America that would
resist the liberal response of blaming individual troubles on
society. At an NAACP dinner in April, Dr. Sullivan spoke of
the "great crisis for the black male" from drugs and crime
and stressed the importance of family and community.
   In opposing nationalized health care, he's even had the
temerity to say socialism isn't good for blacks. "I fear that
black Americans may disproportionately suffer," he told an
audience of black physicians last week. "The rich can always
afford private care, but those who rely on a scheme of
national health insurance -- the poor and disadvantaged --
will have to get in line."
   White liberals such as Pete Stark have grown accustomed to
having blacks as their intellectual caddies. Dr. Sullivan is
saying he wants to join the public-policy club as an equal,
but Mr. Stark wants to keep him carrying someone else's
views. Who's really the "disgrace?"

   The monetary and economic unification of the two Germanys
has been progressing smoothly since its start on July 1, West
German Finance Minister Theo Waigel was reported as saying in
an interview with the newspaper Die Welt.
   Monetary union "on balance just a few weeks after it began
is without doubt positive," Mr. Waigel was quoted as saying.
   In the interview, Mr. Waigel noted that the
consumer-buying explosion that had been feared prior to the
monetary union hasn't occurred; rather, East Germans have
shown a tendency toward saving.
   Mr. Waigel reportedly noted that East Germans are taking
advantage of a "building savings account," which enables them
to save toward building or buying a home under favorable
conditions.
                                                                                                       

   NO BIG MACS NEAR SEOUL PARK
                                                                                                       

   A plan to open a McDonald's franchise next to Olympic Park
in southern Seoul was rejected because of public concern
about commercialization of the historic facility, municipal
officials said. The outlet was built last month, but its
opening had been delayed pending city approval. The fast-food
restaurant is about 100 feet from the six-story Gate of World
Peace at the main entrance to the park, which was the
centerpiece of the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
                                                                                                       

   JAPANESE SPEED LIMITS
                                                                                                       

   Motorists will be able to drive at speeds of up to 85
miles an hour by the next century on two planned expressways
in central and western Japan, a Japanese news agency
reported. The current top speed limit on Japanese highways is
65 miles an hour. In addition to the new speed limit on the
sparsely populated mountainous parts of the new No. 2 Tomei
Expressway linking Tokyo with Nagoya and the Nagoya-Kobe
Expressway, the limit will also be increased to 65 from 50
miles per hour in urban areas, the Construction Ministry
reportedly said. Construction of the expressways will begin
in 1992, for completion in the early 21st century, the news
agency said.

   The U.S. plans to bring back its Peace Corps volunteers to
the Philippines and would consult the Philippine military on
safe places for postings, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt
said. Mr. Platt accompanied Peace Corps worker Timothy
Swanson to a meeting with President Corazon Aquino yesterday,
four days after communist guerrillas freed Mr. Swanson from
50 days captivity. The U.S. ordered the withdrawal of all
Peace Corps volunteers from the country in June.

   South Korea's Daewoo Group will send employees to Japan
this year for training with Suzuki Motor Co., the Japanese
company said. Daewoo initiated the training program to expand
its experience in production of minicars, a Suzuki spokesman
said. Daewoo will begin building the compact vehicles at a
new factory later this year. The employees will spend one to
two months with Suzuki.
                                                                                                       

   PORTUGAL'S MONETARY POLICY
                                                                                                       

   The Bank of Portugal may impose new curbs on
foreign-capital inflows, Vice President Antonio Borges
reportedly said. "We are forced to pursue a tight monetary
policy with consequences for Portuguese investment, while the
main reason behind monetary growth is the inflow of foreign
capital," the central-bank official was quoted by the Diario
de Noticias newspaper as saying. Officials of the bank are
worried that capital inflows, which totaled $4 billion in the
first six months of 1990, are fueling an inflation rate that
now stands at over 13%.
                                                                                                       

   VIETNAMESE RICE CRISIS
                                                                                                       

   Vietnam has been exporting so much rice that in the last
month domestic prices for the staple have doubled in Ho Chi
Minh City and some provinces, Radio Hanoi reported.
   Exporters "have rushed to the city to buy up all the rice
available," Vietnam's official radio said. "This has given
the people the impression that there is a scarcity of rice,
thus prompting many families to buy rice to keep in reserve."
The report gave no price figures.
   Officials are trying to control rice prices by banning
sales to unauthorized exporters and placing one agency in
charge of buying and selling grain within Ho Chi Minh City,
formerly Saigon, the radio report said. Vietnam exported 1.15
million tons of rice in the first six months of 1990, double
its exports for the same period last year.
   Vietnam went from food shortages in 1988 to become the
world's third-largest rice exporter last year. Economic
reforms have given farmers incentives by allowing them to
keep more profits.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   The World Health Organization urged that all passenger
aircraft institute a smoking ban. "We are now calling for all
airlines to be smoke-free. We think it's sensible, we think
it's possible and we think the airlines would support it,"
said a WHO official. . . . A trial program by Hong Kong's
Mass Transit Railway Corp. to add Japanese-language train
announcements to existing announcements in Cantonese and
English was cut short following a negative response from
passengers, a Japanese news agency reported. "People said
that Hong Kong is not a Japanese community, and we shouldn't
cater for a minority, or upgrade the status of Japanese
people," an MTR official was quoted as saying.

   Market Plunges 4.2% to Lowest Level
   Since March 1989; Larger Stocks Dive

   Over-the-counter stocks dove 4.2% to their lowest levels
since March 1989 as investors and professional dealers
continued to shun smaller stocks amid anxiety about the
economy and developments in the Middle East.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index plummeted 17.42 to 400.04, the
fourth largest one-day point drop in the index's history.
Volume eased but remained heavy as 174.8 million shares
changed hands, down from 203.2 million Friday. Declining
stocks trounced advancers, 2,058 to 421.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Investors continued to bail out of the OTC market's
largest stocks and take profits in the technology, emerging
growth and health care shares that had been their favorites
until mid-July. The Nasdaq 100 Index of largest OTC issues
plunged 22.30 to 402.91, a 5.2% drop; the Nasdaq Industrials
of more than 2,000 larger issues fell 21.34 to 426.59, a 4.8%
decline.
   Among the day's largest losers, Nike fell 7 3/4 to 72 3/4;
Liz Claiborne dropped 3 1/2 to 25; Amgen dropped 4 1/4 to 81
1/2; Sun Microsystems slipped 3 1/8 to 27 5/8; Microsoft
tumbled 2 3/4 to 60 1/2, and Intel eased 2 to 37 1/4. Among
foreign issues, Class B American depositary receipts of L.M.
Ericsson Telephone, the Swedish telecommunications giant,
plummeted 15 1/4 to 198 1/2; Reuters ADRs fell 3 1/4 to 52
3/4.
   Trading remained particularly heavy among small investors
using the Small Order Execution System operated by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, said NASD
President Joseph R. Hardiman. Known as "SOES," the system
allows investors to automatically execute up to five orders
of 1,000 shares each at the best available bid or ask price
indicated by all the market makers in a stock. NASD considers
the system to be a good indicator of activity among
individual investors.
   Volume on the system was 60% above normal yesterday and
Friday, according to Mr. Hardiman. Volume on NASD's
smallorder system and similar systems run by a number of
brokerage firms accounts for more than 50% of all shares
traded over-the-counter, he added.
   Some portfolio managers and traders complained that the
fall in OTC shares has been exacerbated by a herd mentality
among market makers: They undercut each other's bids but
refuse to step up and buy shares. The steep declines in some
OTC shares is "due to the fact that everyone is acting in
unison" rather than some market makers venturing to buy
shares when others are marking down their prices, said Alan
Radlo, manager of the $730 million Fidelity OTC Fund.
   "Market makers are running down their bids. It's like
two-year-olds running away from the market," said Mr. Radlo.
He suggested that dealers who advertise their bids on the
automated Nasdaq system should be obligated to commit a
minimum number of shares to the prices they advertise.
   For orders of 1,000 shares or less, market markers are
indeed obligated to honor their advertised prices, Mr.
Hardiman points out, while larger transactions are negotiated
between investors and dealers. Mr. Hardiman defended the
performance of the Nasdaq system yesterday and Friday. "We
had no complaints about the inability to get trades made," he
said, adding that rumors Friday that some traders weren't
answering their telephones were unfounded.
   "I don't think there's anything you can do to prevent
these kinds of sell-offs," Mr. Hardiman said. "There's an
awful lot of uncertainty out there, particularly among
institutional investors and dealers as to what's going to
happen in the Mideast and as to what's going to happen in our
own domestic economy."
   Redemptions at several mutual funds that trade OTC stocks
were running slightly ahead of normal, but not excessively
so. Both T. Rowe Price's $1 billion New Horizons Fund and its
Science &amp; Technology Fund each had net outflows Friday of
about $1 million and didn't see any significant pick-up in
redemptions yesterday, according to a T. Rowe Price
spokesman.
   Two other fund managers said redemptions were less than
they anticipated. Binkley Shorts, manager of the
Over-The-Counter Securities Fund, Boston, said redemptions
were below his daily average. Lawrence Auriana, manager of
the Kauffman Fund, New York, also said he received fewer
redemptions than he expected. But both fund managers
indicated the market has been tough.
   "It's a painful, ugly market out there. There's no place
to hide," said Mr. Shorts.
   Among the day's other losers, American Software Class A
shares plunged more than 25%, or 3 1/8 to 9 5/8. Friday, the
maker of IBM-compatible software indicated that net income
for the fiscal first quarter ended July 31 will be 11 cents
to 17 cents a share, compared with 17 cents a year earlier.
   Some energy issues remained strong as oil prices continued
to rise. Falcon Oil &amp; Gas rose 1 to 5 3/4; Baker Hughes
warrants added 1/2 to 9 1/4, and Hamilton Oil advanced 1 1/4
to 43 3/4.

   Computer-Hungry Soviets Are Hesitant
   To Pick Up the Tab In Hard Currency

   MOSCOW -- Siemens AG thought it had a sweet deal when
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, visiting Bonn in June
1989, signed up the Soviet Union to buy 300,000 personal
computers. But more than a year later, the West German
electronics giant is still waiting to flood the
computer-hungry Soviet market. The purchase is hung up
because the Soviets don't have the hard currency to pay the
bill, company officials say.
   Siemens is one of many Western computer companies
discovering that in today's Soviet Union, it's easier to find
predictions of an explosion of pent-up personal-computer
demand than actual customers. At a recent computer show in
the Soviet capital, most of the 85 U.S., Asian and European
company exhibitors found themselves hobbled by small Soviet
budgets, rampant software piracy and a general lack of
knowledge among managers about Western computers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps the biggest problem is that the Soviet ruble can't
be converted into hard currencies. Under Mr. Gorbachev's
economic reforms, many Soviet enterprises are now able to
spend hard currency they earn from exports. But, show
participants said, persuading managers to buy computers can
be tough. To get around the problem, some suppliers are
turning to elaborate barter deals, selling computers for
rubles and then buying Soviet products for export. While
business is being done, most sellers have scaled back their
expectations. Soviet demand for Western software and
hardware, they say, is likely to be modest for the
foreseeable future.
   "How can the market explode when we have a shortage of
hard currency?" asks Tatyana Fedorenko, a marketing
representative for International Business Machines Corp. in
Moscow. Says Alexander Berest, who works for a Soviet-U.S.
joint venture called Dialog that markets Microsoft products
here: "The market isn't as wide as we would like, but there
is a basis for business."
   Some have been quick to exploit what opportunities there
are. South Korea's Hyundai, which opened an office in Moscow
in June, sold 1,000 computers in its first month to Soviet
organizations -- for dollars. "It's crazy to sell computers
for rubles," says Hyundai manager Yon Hak Choi. Hyundai's
booth at the show was mobbed by hundreds of Soviets eager to
get free handouts of glossy shopping bags and pens.
   Soviet government experts say the nation needs to buy at
least one million computers this year alone. But for Soviet
purchasing managers with little hard currency, need isn't
enough.
   Stepan Pachikov, who founded a U.S.-Soviet joint venture
named Paragraph, says the cost of a computer equals a senior
researcher's salary for five years. "No one has any economic
incentive to replace manual labor with computers," he says.
   Moreover, given the current shortages of many basic goods
in the Soviet Union, workers at enterprises want management
to spend the precious dollars they earn on Western consumer
goods, rather than on computers. "It's going to defer
productivity as long as there's a Gucci shortage," says
Alexander Randall, president of the Boston Computer Exchange.
   Mr. Randall is hoping to supply computers for a stock
exchange that city authorities in Leningrad are planning. One
way he hopes to get around the hard-currency problem is by
purchasing Russian honey with the ruble revenues and then
finding a U.S. company to take it off his hands.
   A used-computer broker, he thinks one low-cost solution
for the Soviet Union would be to buy second-hand computers.
Such plans run up against the pride of Soviet officials, who
say they want state-of-the-art equipment. But Mr. Randall has
a ready answer, thanks to his translator, who suggested he
refer to second-hand computers as "modernized."
   There are other ways out of the hard-currency bind.
Televideo Systems of San Jose, Calif., is looking at two
possible joint ventures to build offices in Moscow with ruble
sales receipts. Tandon Corp. makes its machines in Bombay and
manages to sell them to Russians for surplus rupees on the
Soviet trading account with India.
   Other Westerners hope to spend their rubles on Soviet
software, selling it abroad for hard currency. Patrick
McGovern, chairman of International Data Group, which
sponsored the show, says "in the Soviet Union, the most
exportable commodity is the software that can be created by
their very well-educated technical people." The hit video
game Tetris, for example, is the brainchild of Soviet
programmers.
   Many Soviet programmers are looking to sell abroad because
there is almost no market for software in the Soviet Union.
Boris Antoniuk of the Soviet State Committee on Science and
Technology estimates that of the 350,000 personal computers
on Soviet desks, at most 1% are running legally obtained
software. Piracy is company policy in many cases.
   "Our Western partners must understand one thing: if the
choice is between buying hardware and buying software, a
Soviet buyer with 50,000 rubles worth of hard currency to
spend won't spend half that on software," he warns.

   Treasurys See Biggest One-Day Drop Since 1987
   As Rising Oil Prices Ignite Inflation Worries

   NEW YORK -- The bond market was clobbered as rapidly
rising oil prices fanned inflation fears and prompted market
players to dump some long-term securities.
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which had fallen more
than three points by mid-day, ended 2 5/8 points lower. That
was the largest one-day sell-off in three years. The decline
translates into a loss of $26.25 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The yield on the long bond jumped about 1/4 percentage
point to 8.80% from 8.56%, the biggest one-day rise since
June 1987.
   Such a sharp deterioration in the bond market "tells you
that people are panicking," said Maria Fiorini Ramirez,
president of Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc., a unit
of John Hancock Financial Services. "Investors are very
skittish about the outlook for inflation as well as monetary
and fiscal trends around the world." Holders of long-term
bonds view inflation as negative because it cuts the value of
portfolios.
   Inflation anxiety stems largely from political turmoil in
the Persian Gulf, which is expected to result in less
plentiful and more expensive oil supplies. That, in turn,
could lead to spiraling wages and prices in the U.S.
   Sinking Treasury prices dragged down most other sectors of
the bond market, including corporates, municipals and
mortgage-backed bonds.
   Only Treasury bills were spared during yesterday's rout,
the result of more "flight-to-quality" purchases made by
investors rushing to get cash out of the Middle East into the
U.S., which is considered a safe haven. Many arbitragers and
investors also bought bills, along with shortterm notes, in a
bet that the Federal Reserve will soon reduce the federal
funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans,
from 8%, which would boost the value of short-term
securities.
   Disappointment that the Fed didn't ease yesterday caused
some short-term securities to fall modestly, although not
nearly as much as long-term Treasurys. Prices of two-year
notes ended just 1/8 point lower, while the yield rose to
7.86% from 7.79%.
   John Costas, co-manager of trading at First Boston Corp.,
said investors were buying everything from three-month bills
to five-year notes. But, he said, "there was good selling in
anything seven years and longer."
   The Treasury's benchmark long-term bond began to decline
during overnight trading in Japan, and that spilled over to
the London session. Many of the sellers were U.S. investors,
who woke up in the middle of the night and rushed to
establish short positions. In a short sale, speculators and
professional traders sell borrowed securities and hope to
profit by replacing what was borrowed with cheaper
securities. Trading U.S. bonds overseas is possible because
U.S. Treasurys are traded world-wide around the clock.
   "When London opened, we carried the overflow from Tokyo
for about one hour. At that time, we were very busy," said
Philip Harding, manager of trading in the London office of
Carroll McEntee &amp; McGinley Inc. But soon afterward, activity
quieted down and "we just settled in and waited for New York
to open," said Mr. Harding.
   U.S. trading turned out to be extremely volatile.
Long-term prices opened at levels set in Tokyo but quickly
slid into a free fall as when-issued trading began on the
$32.25 billion of securities the Treasury is scheduled to
auction today, tomorrow and Thursday.
   The when-issued trading was an eyeopener, analysts said,
because it revealed the depth of the investment community's
fear of buying fixed-income securities. They also discovered
that foreign investors, who normally buy large amounts of
U.S. Treasurys at the big quarterly auction, are shunning the
securities.
   "With Japanese bonds trading roughly at yields of 8%,
German bonds at 9% and French bonds at 10%, international
investors believe there is no incentive for them to buy U.S.
bonds," said William Brachfeld, manager of trading at Daiwa
Securities America Inc.
   Meanwhile, the lack of retail interest in the Treasury
auctions forced dealers to mark down prices in an effort to
clear out current inventory of 10-year and 30-year bonds,
putting further pressure on prices.
   The spiral downward grew steeper as the futures market
crumbled and the September bond contract touched its
threepoint lower limit. The contract rose later and ended
just 2 21/32 lower, and officials at the Chicago Board of
Trade estimated that 700,000 bond contracts were trading, the
heaviest volume since June 1989.
   As prices of the benchmark bond sank to 3 1/4 points
lower, bargain hunters finally materialized and helped to
pull prices off the bottom.
   Robert Dow, a partner and portfolio manager at Lord,
Abbett &amp; Co., which manages mutual funds, was among
yesterday's bottom-fishers. "These are very attractive
yields," he said. Unlike traders, who try to book quick
profits on daily moves in the market, Mr. Dow said he's
investing for the long term. "I don't have to worry about
where things will be in the next day or two. I'm looking at
the market over the next six to 12 months, and by that time I
think interest rates will be lower," and bond prices will be
higher, he said.
   Still, traders said sellers far outnumbered buyers
yesterday.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate, Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Junk-bond prices sank as tumbling stock prices combined
with rising interest rates continued to cloud the horizon for
the high-yield, high-risk securities.
   Prices of most junk bonds, which began falling as stock
prices started to plummet, ended between 1 and 1 1/2 points
lower.
   Some high-yield bonds, including widely held securities of
RJR Nabisco Inc., posted even bigger losses. RJR Nabisco's 17
3/8% convertible pay-in-kind debentures finished near its
lows of the day at 108 1/2, down three points. Pay-in-kind
bonds pay interest in the form of additional securities.
   RJR's 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures managed to
stage a partial rebound, ending down 1 1/4 points at 88 3/4
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   David Briggs, a senior trader at Pittsburgh-based
Federated Investors Inc., said he tried to sell junk bonds
Monday but found that the level at which he was able to trade
was often much lower than the quoted market. "Sometimes you
have to shave 1/2 point off the price just to get the trade
done," he said.
   In the investment-grade corporate debt market, prices of
high-grade corporate issues plunged in sympathy with steep
declines in the U.S. Treasury market. Intermediate-term
corporate bonds finished the day 1/2 point lower while
long-term corporate bonds flagged losses of between 1 1/2 and
1 3/4 points.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The sell-off in the U.S. bond market along with growing
tensions in the Middle East reverberated around the world
yesterday, leaving most major international bond markets
reeling.
   "This was one of the biggest sell-offs in international
bond markets since 1987," when a breakdown in the Louvre
Accords resulted in a global bond-market rout, said Nicholas
Sargen, a director of bond-market research at Salomon
Brothers Inc. The Louvre Accord sessions were held by major
industrial nations in an effort to seek ways to stabilize the
sinking dollar.
   Although political tensions in the Middle East began last
week, Mr. Sargen said that international investors assumed
the problems would be temporary and therefore didn't panic.
But now that it appears that tensions could escalate,
investors are worrying that "this could be the beginning of
the third oil shock."
   Hardest hit yesterday was the British market, where prices
slid nearly two points in light trading. The 11.75% bond due
2003/2007 closed at 99 3/32, down 1 31/ 32 from late Friday
to yield 11.87%.
   In Japan trading activity was hectic and extremely
volatile. At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, the price of the benchmark No. 119 4.8% bond was
quoted at 83.60, down 1.13 points. The issue's yield, which
rose as high as 8.04%, ended at about 7.96%. That's up 0.26
percentage point from Friday. (When calculated using the
semiannual compound method, the yield on the No. 119 closed
at about 7.33%, according to Salomon Brothers.)
   Elsewhere: French Treasurys were off 1 1/2 points in
hectic trading while prices of West German government bonds
ended nearly one point lower.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Long-term Treasurys posted sharp declines yesterday. The
benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 99
10/32, down from 101 30/32 on Friday.
   Shorter-term Treasurys, however, suffered just modest
declines. The latest twoyear notes ended at 100 7/32, down
from 100 11/32.
   Bond dealers began when-issued trading yesterday for the
$32.25 billion of securities scheduled to be auctioned this
week in the Treasury Department's quarterly refunding of the
federal debt.
   The Treasury will sell $11.5 billion of three-year notes
today, $10.5 billion of tenyear note tomorrow and $10.25
billion of 30-year bond on Thursday.
   In when-issued trading, yields were quoted at 8.06% for
the three-year notes, 8.70% for the ten-year notes and 8.81%
for the 30-year bond.
   Yesterday, the Treasury sold $18.4 billion of Treasury
bills at its regular weekly auction. The average discount
rate on the three-month bills was 7.23% while the average
rate on the six-month bills was 7.19%. Those rates are down
sharply from last week's auction when they were set at 7.50%
and 7.37%, respectively.
   The rate on three-month bills was the lowest since the
average of 7.17% at the auction on Sept. 19, 1988 and matches
the auctions on Sept. 26, 1988, and Oct. 3, 1988. The rate on
six-month bills was the lowest since the average of 7.15% at
the auction on Aug. 1, 1988.
   Here are details of yesterday's auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated Aug. 9. The 13-week bills mature

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Most actively traded municipal bonds closed 1 1/4 to 1 1/2
points lower, taking their cue from the Treasury market and
reacting to skyrocketing oil prices.
   The "only hope" for municipals is that some support will
come from the market's shortage of bonds and expectations for
higher taxes in a number of states, said one trader.
   Among the actively traded issues, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% of 2018 ended 1 1/4 lower at 97 7/8,
causing the yield to shoot up to 7.36% from 7.26% late
Friday.
   In the new-issue sector, the market's bearish mood caused
a less-than-warm reception for an issue by Maricopa County,
Ariz., of $75 million of general-obligation bonds.
   The bonds, won by a Marine Midland Capital Markets Corp.
group, were priced for reoffering to yield from 6.65% in 1999
to 6.90% in 2003.
   There was an unsold balance of approximately $60 million
in late trading.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended sharply lower, following the
path of Treasury issues.
   Among actively traded issues, Government National Mortgage
Association 9% issues were down 1 21/32 at 96 9/32, Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues were off 1 9/32 at 98
12/32, and Federal National Mortgage Association 9% issues
were down 1 17/32 at 96 11/32.
   In new-issue activity, a $150 million offering of Western
Financial auto-loan backed certificates was priced by
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   The certificates, backed by California loans on new and
used autos, carry an 8.35% coupon, and were priced at 99.896
to yield 8.51%.

   Networks used to worry how things would play in Peoria.
Now, NBC News may have come up with a great new
audience-research tool: the Queens housewife test.
   There was a heated debate last week among the staffers at
"NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw," the No. 3-rated network
newscast. The producers were enthusiastic about a report from
Robin Lloyd, an NBC News correspondent based in Johannesburg,
on apartheid and its effect on the education of South African
children.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Steve Friedman, who became executive producer of
"Nightly News" in May, wanted to ax the piece, insisting that
viewers were becoming bored with the South African story.
   The segment, which was two minutes long and therefore
considered practically documentary length for a 22-minute
broadcast, was then screened for the "Nightly News" staffers,
who thought it should be allowed to run.
   "I challenged the staff to prove it was a piece that would
interest a housewife in Queens," says Mr. Friedman. "The
challenge was to show me how interested the American public
was in South Africa" after the visit of Nelson Mandela.
   Rising to the challenge was Sofia Perez, a production
assistant, who said her mother Josefina, happened to be a
housewife in Astoria, Queens, and she was sure mom would be
interested in the report. Mr. Friedman made an executive
decision: Let Josefina Perez screen the piece. If she liked
it, it would air.
   "I didn't tell her why I was showing it to her," says Ms.
Perez. "But I took notes on her reaction. She said anyone
with a child would be interested in this."
   And that's how, on Aug. 1, the Robin Lloyd piece was seen
by millions of viewers. "It's nice to have this kind of
debate," says Ms. Perez, who adds, "My mother was very happy
that the staff was pleased with the results."
   It's not the first time a newscast has tried to solicit
viewer opinion. Turner Broadcasting System's Cable News
Network last month began asking viewers of its overnight
newscast to help select stories by calling a 900 number to
voice their interests.
   Will letting selected viewers prescreen a story be the
next leap forward?
   Mr. Friedman insists that this unusual methodology
wouldn't be used on a regular basis. "Just call the report
`Sofia's Choice,'" he says.

   Justice Department Plans to Investigate
   Sudden Increases in Prices of Gasoline

   WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said it will look
into the sudden increases in gasoline prices that followed
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   "We will look closely for any indication that these
increases may be the result of anticompetitive activity,"
said James Rill, head of the department's antitrust division.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Rill's statement followed an outcry from the White
House, scores of members of Congress and state attorneys
general around the country attacking oil companies.
   Despite the strong rhetoric, however, there's little the
government can do if it can't show some sort of collusion in
the oil industry.
   The federal government dismantled the last controls over
gasoline prices in 1981, and there is little interest in
Congress for reimposing them. There were a few calls for
price controls earlier in the year when congressional panels
focused attention on a spurt in heating oil prices.
   Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore said the agency would
monitor prices, but said, "We at DOE have no authority to
dictate prices, nor should we."
   "We do not have any price control system now," said Rep.
Philip Sharp (D., Ind.), chairman of the House energy
subcommittee who is convening a hearing into energy prices
today. "The president ought to be focusing on some jawboning
with the oil companies."
   In response to reporters' questions yesterday, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, "It's not clear that all of
the increases that have been reported at the consumer level
are necessary, and we would certainly urge . . . all
companies not to be anticipatory."
   Gasoline prices at service stations across the country
spurted almost as quickly as Iraqi troops moved into Kuwait.
Prices jumped an additional seven cents a gallon over the
weekend, bringing the four-day average national increase to
11 cents since Mideast hosilities put oil markets in turmoil.
   The average price for regular unleaded climbed to $1.186 a
gallon, according to a spot check of 1,400 service stations
by the American Automobile Association. While the increases
were across the board, California may have the biggest
advances, with prices up 12 to 15 cents.
   Gasoline price-increases are being initiated at all points
in the supply chain, from refiners to wholesalers to corner
stations, in step with soaring commodity market quotes. More
increases may be in store; gasoline futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange rose more than nine cents a gallon
yesterday.
   The supply of gasoline hasn't significantly changed, and
much of the fuel currently for sale has been in inventory.
But oil experts say that when Iraq invaded Kuwait last week,
the same nervousness about possible supply disruptions that
touched off panicky crude-oil buying also hit gasoline
markets, leading to the rise in pump prices.
   Like many consumers, members of Congress complained that
the prices moved before the events in the Middle East had any
impact on U.S. oil supplies.
   But the day-to-day price of oil -- and even of gasoline
and other refined products -- is heavily influenced by
futures-market traders who buy and sell contracts on
speculation about future price moves. When prices are rising,
the changes often hit the gasoline pump immediately because
wholesalers and retailers have the ability to sell their
supplies through exchanges at the futures-market price.
   "There's no conspiracy," said Philip Verlanger of the
Institute for International Economics, a Washington think
tank. "It is the market at work."
   Nevertheless, House and Senate committees called hearings
for today into energy prices, and there was congressional
pressure on the Bush administration to tap the U.S. strategic
petroleum reserve. More than two dozen senators signed a
letter to President Bush asking him to convene a special
federal task force to monitor gasoline prices and recommend a
response.
   "Across the board, the big oil companies have gone on a
feeding frenzy," said Sen. Richard Bryan (D., Nev.), chairman
of the Senate consumer subcommittee, which also scheduled a
hearing for today. "This isn't panic. This is greed."
   But Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.), who spent years
battling oil companies when he was attorney general in
Connecticut, acknowledged yesterday that the government's
legal options "are not enormous." Besides a Justice
Department antitrust investigation, the Federal Trade
Commission could investigate unfair trade practices.
   Although there has been a surplus of oil in world markets,
the Energy Department said that at last tally, U.S. gasoline
stocks were "slightly below the lower limit of the average
range for the last three years." As of July 27, the nation
had 217.8 million barrels of gasoline on hand, 10.1% below
the same date last year.

   McDonald's Plans
   Tactics to Boost
   Its Sales Margins

<LP>
   McDonald's Corp., pummeled by the stock market in recent
days, sought to soothe nervous Wall Street analysts by
promising to reduce the cost of new restaurants and using
discounting as a sales tactic.
   Some analysts came away from the conference call with
McDonald's disappointed at what they didn't hear.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I didn't learn anything new with respect to the
fundamental issues such as turning sales around in the U.S.,"
said Michael Mueller of Montgomery Securities Inc., San
Francisco.
   Similarly, Prudential-Bache Securities restaurant analyst
Leslie Steppel said, "There wasn't any new strategy revealed
-- just a rehashing. I didn't come away feeling that anything
was going to change."
   But McDonald's executives did say they intend to take
perhaps $100,000 out of the cost of building a new domestic
store, primarily in equipment and construction savings. The
current average cost of about $1.5 million has come under
fire lately for rising more rapidly than the sales rate.
   The company, which blamed the softening economy and
intense competition for no-growth domestic sales, reiterated
it is willing to use discounting as a tactic -- but not a
strategy -- to improve sales at the expense of margins.
   Also, executives told analysts that despite the low
current price of its stock, McDonald's is likely to reduce
its share repurchase plan. McDonald's closed yesterday at
$29.125, down $1.125 in composite New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   In the past two weeks the price of McDonald's shares have
fallen nearly $10 a share, as its second-quarter earnings
came in below some Wall Street estimates and as nervous
investors have deserted even blue-chip issues such as
McDonald's.
   The company still plans to open more than 300 restaurants
in the U.S. this year, Ms. Steppel said. But it struck her as
a contradiction that McDonald's is relying increasingly on
franchisees domestically while putting more company-owned
stores overseas. Franchisees' profit margins typically are
lower than that of company-owned stores.
   "They indicated that the environment was competitive and
difficult and was likely to remain so for the second half,"
Mr. Mueller said. And despite intense price-cutting by some
fast-food competitors, he said that "discounting is not going
to be employed as a strategy. It's one of an arsenal of
tactics."
   Nevertheless, McDonald's told analysts and portfolio
managers it is comfortable with per-share earnings estimates
of between $2.20 and $2.25 for the year.
   As for McDonald's pizza, in test since last summer,
executives said it is at least two years away from becoming
part of the domestic menu, analysts reported. Earlier, some
had thought the product would be rolled out much sooner.

   Jefferies Officer
   And Ex-Trader
   Accept Suspensions

   WASHINGTON -- The former top trader of Jefferies &amp; Co. and
another senior trader agreed to six-month suspensions from
the securities industry to settle civil charges of
securities-law violations in major Wall Street cases.
   The two settlements wrap up major loose ends from
Jefferies &amp; Co. Chairman Boyd Jefferies's decision to
cooperate with the government. Mr. Jefferies, who has been
barred from the securities industry for life for his role in
several illegal stock transactions, is eligible to apply for
reinstatement in 1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Jefferies's ex-trading director James Melton and Senior
Vice President Michael Landy settled the Securities and
Exchange Commission charges without admitting or denying
guilt. Both men cooperated with federal prosecutors under
immunity from criminal prosecution but had no such agreement
with the SEC against any civil action. The agency noted in
the settlement agreements, however, that the suspensions were
shorter than they would have been if the men hadn't
cooperated.
   Mr. Melton was a witness in the recent stock-manipulation
conviction of GAF Corp. and James Sherwin, its vice chairman.
In 1986, the company and Mr. Sherwin asked Mr. Jefferies to
boost the stock price of Union Carbide Corp. before the sale
of a large block of Carbide stock, according to testimony at
the trial. In return, GAF and Mr. Sherwin agreed to indemnify
Jefferies, a Los Angeles brokerage firm, against any loss in
the stock trading.
   The SEC also said that when Jefferies bought the shares,
it did so in its own name, concealing that GAF was the actual
owner of the stock. Jefferies had losses of about $40,000 in
the transactions, which was to be paid by GAF through a plan
devised to conceal the true reason for the payment, the
agency said. But that check was never sent, Mr. Jefferies
said at the criminal trial, because a few days later Ivan
Boesky was indicted on insider-trading charges. Mr. Boesky's
testimony to prosecutors eventually led to Mr. Jefferies's
plea agreement and subsequent assistance.
   Mr. Melton, as the firm's head trader, was the firm's
liaison with Mr. Sherwin, the SEC said. He handled the buying
and selling of the Carbide shares, making sure that his
purchases were the last of the day so that they would keep
the stock price high, the agency added. After the purchases,
he would call Mr. Sherwin to inform him of the transactions,
the SEC said.
   Mr. Jefferies, who also entered a plea agreement with
federal prosecutors, was the star witness in the GAF trial.
   An attorney for Mr. Melton, Michael Klowden, said his
client "was disappointed that the commission decided to take
this action in light of the fact that {Mr. Melton}
voluntarily came forward and cooperated. His decision to
settle the matter was to get it behind him." He said Mr.
Melton, who left Jefferies last year, has returned to school.
   In the other case, Mr. Landy was a key witness in the
recent securities-fraud conviction of former Singer Co.
Chairman Paul Bilzerian last year. As a Jefferies senior vice
president, Mr. Landy helped the investor "park" stock, or
hold shares for Mr. Bilzerian to conceal their true
ownership.
   In three separate deals between May 1985 and September
1986, Mr. Bilzerian asked Mr. Landy to buy stakes in Cluett,
Peabody &amp; Co., H.H. Robertson Inc. and Armco Inc., according
to the SEC. The agency said that Mr. Landy purchased the
blocks and was protected from any loss by Mr. Bilzerian, who
has since been convicted on criminal charges and sentenced to
four years in prison.
   Mr. Landy's attorney, Michael Mitchell, said, "Mr. Landy
chose to settle this matter rather than to litigate it
because of the cost in both time and money." But Mr. Mitchell
expressed anger over the handling of his client's case. "It
is a sad day when one branch of the government uses immunized
testimony for its benefit and then, when the witness's
usefulness has ceased, another branch of government turns on
the witness and sanctions him."
   Mr. Mitchell said that Mr. Landy will remain at Jefferies
for about two weeks.

   Penthouse Profits Fuel Guccione Buying

   In the 1970s, Bob Guccione was the prototypical swinging
magazine publisher. Like his counterpart and rival, Playboy
publisher Hugh Hefner, Mr. Guccione lived fast and made
millions selling sexual fantasy through the pages of
Penthouse.
   Hef has largely retired to the mansion. But Mr. Guccione,
60 years old and loaded down with gold chains and medallions,
is still swinging. Though many pin-striped publishers are
closing magazines or auctioning large properties, Mr.
Guccione has become, largely by default, the most acquisitive
publisher in the business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As chairman of closely held General Media International
Inc., Mr. Guccione is moving beyond the skin magazines on
which he's built his fortune, snapping up special-interest
magazines for car lovers and personal-computer users --
magazines that other publishers had passed on as being too
small or in fields too competitive. In June, he acquired
Stock Car Racing and two other car magazines. In April, he
acquired Compute] from Capital Cities/ABC Inc. He has doubled
the circulation of Four Wheeler magazine since acquiring it
in 1986. And he may revive the defunct literary magazine
Saturday Review, to which he owns the rights, as a Sunday
magazine supplement to metropolitan newspapers.
   Profits from Four Wheeler, 12-year-old Omni magazine,
digest-sized Forum and a slew of Penthouse spinoffs financed
his $5 million launch in 1988 of Longevity, a health magazine
that has grown quickly in advertising and circulation.
General Media International, once known as Penthouse
International, stayed away from junk bond financing in the
1980s. It has manageable debt, Mr. Guccione says, and thus
can spend on start-ups and acquisitions with relative
freedom.
   "Guccione is in good shape," says Charles Elbaum,
president of Publishing Economics Inc., a consulting company.
"It's a smart and quiet company. They don't make a lot of
noise, but they make a lot of money."
   Indeed, Penthouse has long supported Mr. Guccione's
luxurious life style. His Manhattan town house includes a
ballroom, indoor pool, and paintings by Chagall, Degas and
Picasso. Mr. Guccione, dressed in a sweater, no shirt, and
the usual array of gold chains and rings, says: "I can't ever
forget what Penthouse has done for us. It spoiled us." Mr.
Guccione runs the company with his wife, Kathy Keeton, who is
vice chairman of General Media and heads Omni and Longevity.
   "Other publishers, they respect me," Mr. Guccione adds.
"They may not say it, but they would die to have Penthouse.
It's a cash cow. People look down their noses at the National
Enquirer, but when it was up for sale, all the major
publishers stood in line, and it sold for $412 million."
   But Mr. Guccione is also regarded as part of the seamy
underbelly of the magazine world. Several national drug and
convenience store chains continue to boycott Penthouse and
other men's magazines. There's also lingering fallout from
former Attorney General Edwin Meese's Commission on
Pornography, which scared retailers and stirred community
activists who object to Penthouse and Playboy.
   These challenges may have helped to depress Penthouse's
circulation, though the magazine, which generates about 60%
of General Media's $200 million in annual revenue, remains a
huge seller. According to Capell's Circulation Report, an
industry newsletter, Penthouse last year was the No. 7
magazine and No. 3 monthly in newsstand sales at 1.9 million
copies a month.
   The Audit Bureau of Circulations, which lists numbers
based on a six-month reporting period, puts Penthouse's total
circulation for this year's first half at 1.7 million.
Playboy expects to report circulation for the same period of
about 3.4 million, three-quarters of that from subscriptions.
With a $5 cover price, Penthouse's newsstand sales make it
the most profitable monthly magazine in the country for the
retailers who sell it.
   Penthouse sells about 63% of the total copies it puts on
newsstands and at checkouts, making it one of only 20
magazines in the country to sell over 60%. That may augur
well for the future: Publishers are expected to be hit with a
postal-rate increase of as much as 23% early next year. "If
you are a publisher heavily into subscriptions, you will get
slammed by the rate increase," says Mr. Elbaum.
   But even with that advantage, Mr. Guccione knows the glory
days of Penthouse are past. Selling 1.9 million copies a
month is "terrific by industry standards, considering
Penthouse is usually sold behind the counter" or in a rack
that obscures most of the magazine's cover, says Dan Capell,
the consultant who tracks magazine circulation. But in the
days before the Meese commission, Penthouse newsstand sales
reached 3.8 million copies in 1982.
   Many major retailers still refuse to sell the magazine.
Southland Corp., the nation's largest convenience-store
owner, stripped Penthouse and Playboy from the shelves of its
4,500 company-owned 7-Eleven stores in 1986 and recommended
that its 4,000 franchised stores do the same. "The vast
majority of franchises do comply with our recommendation,"
says Cecilia Norwood, a Southland spokeswoman. Peoples Drug
Stores Inc., operator of 500 stores in the mid-Atlantic
states, also banned Penthouse in 1986, then allowed it back
on a trial basis last year until customer complaints and slow
sales prompted the chain to pull it again.
   "Its sales have never recovered, either because of lack of
exposure at the counters or because tastes have changed,"
says John Harrington, president of the Council for Periodical
Distributors Associations.
   Mr. Guccione concedes that newsstand sales are likely to
fall further in coming years. "Penthouse will continue to be
our flagship, but there will never be another magazine that
can sell four million copies a month at newsstands," he says.
   Mr. Guccione's attempts to create other men's and sexually
explicit magazines haven't worked. Viva, a sex magazine for
women, bombed because retailers displayed it next to Hustler
instead of Cosmopolitan. New Look, a general-interest
magazine that used striking, often shocking photos, including
some nudity that wasn't sexually suggestive, was launched in
1985, near the height of publicity stirred by the Meese
commission. Many stores were afraid to carry it, and it
folded after a year.
   Mr. Guccione made his first stab at special-interest
magazines in 1986 with the acquisition of Four Wheeler, a
magazine based in Canoga Park, Calif. Mr. Guccione says he
"didn't mess with the editorial product," kept the offices in
California, and improved the paper stock and design. In four
years, Four Wheeler's circulation has nearly doubled to
355,466. The three automotive titles bought in June will be
added to the Four Wheeler division and sold to advertisers as
a group.
   Compute] will be more of a gamble. The computer magazine
field is thoroughly saturated. Under Capital Cities/ABC,
circulation for Compute] was falling. Under the control of
Ms. Keeton, Compute] will be reintroduced with a new design
in October and aimed mainly at home and office
personal-computer users. Compute] will be offered to
advertisers in a package with Omni, Mr. Guccione's science
magazine.
   Mr. Guccione's longest leap from his Penthouse past is
probably his introduction of a Russian edition of Omni, which
involved speaking recently before the Soviet Academy of
Sciences. "In the U.S., they say, `How could Bob Guccione
create a science magazine? It must be a fluke,'" Mr. Guccione
says. "But the Soviets have a hunger for Western ideas. I was
treated as if I were Funk and Wagnall."
   But there was another dimension to his visit. Some
Russians took him aside and suggested that he launch a
Russian version of Penthouse, he adds. "They told me it would
be good for the Soviet man."

   Mutual Funds:
   Small Investors
   Start to Pull Out
   Of Stock Funds

   NEW YORK -- Small investors, spooked by the specter of a
prolonged stock market slide, have begun bailing out of stock
mutual funds.
   While there weren't any signs of a mass exodus, many large
mutual-fund groups said investors yanked more money out than
they put into stock funds on Friday. Yesterday, those
redemptions accelerated; several funds became heavy sellers
of stocks, raising cash to meet any further redemptions,
traders said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're not seeing a panic and people blowing out, but
obviously they are moving away from equity funds until the
smoke settles," said Robert Leo, an executive vice president
and director of mutual funds at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   The redemptions appear to have stopped the budding
stock-fund recovery in its tracks: Through June, investors
had poured $13.8 billion more into stock funds than they
pulled out, putting the fund industry on track for its best
year ever. Once again, it seems, small investors entered the
stock market in droves just in time for prices to tank.
   The most frenzied activity has involved funds sold
directly to investors, rather than through brokers. Fidelity
Investments, the nation's largest fund group, said net
redemptions were "moderate" Friday. Yesterday, the outflow
from Fidelity stock funds was the largest since last autumn,
traders said. A Fidelity spokesman said the firm has "more
than ample cash to meet any redemptions we might experience."
   Investors also pulled out more money yesterday from stock
funds than they put into them at other big direct-market
groups, including Vanguard Group Inc., T. Rowe Price
Associates Inc., Twentieth Century Investors and Janus
Capital Corp.
   So far, redemptions are nowhere near the levels that
followed the October 1987 stock market crash or the "junk"
fund sales stemming from the minicrash of October 1989.
   And much of the redemptions, which have come primarily
from growth stock funds and international portfolios, have
been switched into money market funds. This means the assets
have stayed within the fund companies, but these firms earn
more from stock funds because they require more active
management.
   Nevertheless, the activity has put many big fund companies
on guard. Groups such as Fidelity and T. Rowe Price have
added extra staff members to answer telephones. Fidelity's
flagship Magellan Fund has raised its cash position to 8%
from about 7% less than two weeks ago.
   While investors had been pouring in about $5 million a day
into T. Rowe Price stock funds in July, they took out about
$15 million on Friday, officials of the firm said. But this
represents less than 1% of T. Rowe Price stock fund assets
and is far less than the outflow during previous market
debacles, they said.
   "Anybody who had been thinking of reducing their equity
exposure had a good excuse to do it," said Steven Norwitz, a
T. Rowe Price vice president.
   At Janus, investors pulled $14 million out of its three
stock funds on Friday and funneled the money into the Janus
money market fund, a spokeswoman said. As more than $1.6
billion is invested in Janus's stock funds, she said, the
outflow "wasn't overwhelming."
   Twentieth Century, which has several aggressive-growth
stock funds that are susceptible to skittish investors, said
yesterday's stock fund outflows exceeded those on Friday.
"But we're not being avalanched," a spokesman said, declining
to quantify the redemption activity. "It's nothing that's
raising alarm bells here."
   Shearson Lehman, as at many other fund groups, has seen
the most significant investor reaction in its
aggressive-growth and capital-appreciation funds. Money
flowing into Shearson's stock funds has plunged as much as
25% in recent days, said Mr. Leo, Shearson's mutual funds
director.
   Vanguard said its stock funds outflow yesterday was the
heaviest since last autumn. But one reason for this, the firm
said, is that money has been streaming into its stock funds
for most of this year. "It's a warped yardstick," Brian
Mattes, a Vanguard vice president, said.
   For their part, fund groups emphasize that investors have
learned to buy on market drops. But some fund specialists
said investors may be surprised this time. This is because
the most recent stock market decline could be prolonged, they
said, considering the uncertainty about the Middle East and
the weak state of the economy.
   "You can't always look at what happened the last time
around," Donald Phillips, editor of Morningstar Inc.'s Mutual
Fund Values publication, said. "If you expect this to be
quick and painless, you may be as wrong as people were in
October 1987, when they expected the drop to be long and
drawn out."

   Pakistan's Bhutto Ousted, Rival Given
   Caretaker Role as Emergency Is Declared

   Benazir Bhutto was toppled as the first woman leader of an
Islamic country, after 20 tumultuous months as Pakistan's
leader.
   In a move that surprised Pakistan and Miss Bhutto's
government, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dissolved the
National Assembly on Monday and declared a state of
emergency, saying the government was ineffective and corrupt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The government willfully undermined and impaired the work
of the constitution," Mr. Ishaq Khan said. "Corruption and
nepotism in the federal government has reached such
proportions that the orderly functioning of the government no
longer carries public faith and credibility."
   President Ishaq Khan appointed Miss Bhutto's main
political rival, Mustafa Jatoi, as caretaker prime minister
and scheduled national elections Oct. 24. Four other
politicians, including a member of Miss Bhutto's Pakistan
People's Party, were named to a caretaker cabinet.
   The Pakistan army took over the national television
station and telephone exchanges, and spread troops throughout
the capital. But army Chief of Staff Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg
said the army wasn't taking control. "We are not going to get
involved," he said.
   The state of emergency, declared early Monday morning,
suspends certain individual rights. Miss Bhutto on Monday
warned her supporters not to resort to violence.
   At a news conference, Miss Bhutto called the assembly's
dissolution "illegal and unconstitutional" and labeled the
charges against her government a "slander campaign." She also
said the army had surrounded her Islamabad residence.
   But her press secretary, Kamran Shafi, said Miss Bhutto
wanted the elections to be held in October, adding, "She's
absolutely certain the PPP will come in with a bigger
majority."
   The big question is whether Mr. Ishaq Khan actually will
hold elections. If he does, Miss Bhutto's political rivals
will have a huge advantage in competing against a prime
minister dismissed for ineffectiveness and corruption. If the
poll isn't held, Miss Bhutto may prove to be the victim of a
military coup camouflaged by promises of elections.
   Mr. Ishaq Khan, who became president after the death of
Gen. Mohammad Zia ulHaq in 1987, maintains close ties with
the military. In 1977, when Gen. Zia overthrew then Prime
Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Miss Bhutto's father, he
promised elections that weren't held for eight years, and
finally occurred only under an altered constitution. In 1979,
Gen. Zia ordered Mr. Bhutto's hanging after the former prime
minister had been convicted of ordering the murder of a
political foe.
   In dissolving the assembly Monday, Mr. Ishaq Khan probably
was acting within his power under the 1973 constitution that
Gen. Zia amended in 1985 to strengthen the power of the
president. The constitution says the president "may also
dissolve the National Assembly at his discretion where, in
his opinion, an appeal to the electorate is necessary." Miss
Bhutto probably will challenge the order in court.
   Mr. Ishaq Khan's charges against Miss Bhutto and her
government will ring true to many Pakistanis. She inherited
serious problems when she became prime minister in 1989,
including widespread poverty, ethnic chaos, tension with
neighboring India and a restive military that has held power
for most of Pakistan's 43-year history.
   But Miss Bhutto proved an ineffective and sometimes
diffident leader, making worse some of the problems she
inherited. For nearly a year, Miss Bhutto's government
concentrated on political survival in the National Assembly,
where she ruled in a coalition. Even after she survived a
no-confidence vote last November and won over enough
assemblymen to command a thin majority -- 137 of 237 seats --
she wasn't able to control the country.
   In particular, her government was powerless to stop
widespread rioting in June in two cities in Sindh, her home
province. Miss Bhutto finally had to ask the army to move in
to restore order.
   Allegations of corruption were leveled against Miss
Bhutto's ministers, party associates and even her husband,
businessman Asif Zardari. Miss Bhutto and her husband denied
the charges.
   Her poor record will give some legitimacy to President
Ishaq Khan's decision to sack Miss Bhutto and dissolve the
National Assembly. At the same time, analysts said, his
timing should be ideal for Miss Bhutto's electoral
challengers, coming so soon after her failure in Sindh
province. Miss Bhutto wasn't required to call elections until
1994.
   Many of Miss Bhutto's party members in the assembly have
expressed fears about an early election, saying they have no
achievements to show voters. In 20 months in power, the
government has passed no legislation except the federal
budget.
   Miss Bhutto's relationship with the army also has
deteriorated. Earlier in the year, she and the army were
cooperating on policy toward Kashmir, the violence-wracked
province claimed by both Pakistan and India. The two
countries came close to war, but the crisis brought together
the ruling triad of Pakistan: Miss Bhutto, the army and
President Ishaq Khan.
   The crisis in Sindh fractured that alliance. The army
faulted Miss Bhutto for not solving it by political means and
noted that supporters of her own party were involved in
violent clashes there that have claimed more than 400 lives
since late May.

   Saddam Hussein Is Now Possible Broker
   In U.S.-Iranian Dispute Over Hostages

   WASHINGTON -- By seizing Kuwait, Saddam Hussein has made
himself a possible broker in the U.S.-Iranian dispute over
the six U.S. hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian
kidnappers.
   That's because Iraq now gains control over 15 pro-Iranian
Shiite terrorists who have been imprisoned in Kuwait and
whose freedom has been demanded repeatedly by both the
kidnappers and Iran's government as a condition for releasing
the U.S. hostages.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Shiite group, members of the pro-Iranian Da'wa party,
includes a brother-in-law of one of the Lebanese
hostage-holders, Imad Mugniyah. Mr. Mugniyah's faction,
Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, has demanded the release
of the Da'wa prisoners in return for freeing the U.S.
hostages it says it holds, including Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of the Associated Press.
   Kuwait's charge d'affaires in Jordan, Faisal al-Mukhaizem,
told the Reuters news agency Sunday that the 15 had been
taken to Baghdad Friday. "They are going to use them as
bargaining counters," Reuters quoted the diplomat as saying.
Earlier, ABC News had reported that the men had been freed
during Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   But U.S. intelligence hasn't been able to confirm either
report or other claims that the prisoners have been executed.
"We just don't know where they are right now," says one State
Department official.
   The 15 men are serving sentences for the December 1983
bombings of the U.S. and French embassies and other targets
in Kuwait City that killed six people and injured about 60.
   The Kuwaiti ruling family had refused to release the
prisoners, despite recent appeals from Iranian officials
eager to end the hostage crisis in order to rebuild ties to
the West and gain financing for reconstruction in the wake of
their country's war with Iraq. One reason, U.S. officials
say, is that the conservative Kuwaiti rulers agreed with the
U.S. policy of refusing concessions to the hostage-holders.
Another was that the terrorists had tried to overthrow the
Kuwait government and rouse the country's large Shiite
population to rebellion.
   U.S. intelligence analysts believe that any
Iraqi-controlled regime could be just as likely as Kuwait to
keep the Shiite prisoners in jail, or even kill them. The
Da'wa party has actively opposed Saddam Hussein's regime and
carried out killings and terrorism within Iraq as well as
Kuwait, with the aim of establishing an Iran-style Islamic
Republic in Baghdad. Saddam Hussein's regime is made up of
minority Sunni Moslems ruling a majority Shiite population.
   In addition, Mr. Hussein would be eager to prevent Iran
from ending the hostage crisis and possibly improving
relations with the West.
   But Mr. Hussein might also use the prisoners as a
bargaining chip to exercise influence over Iran or the U.S.
He could release them, as Iran wishes, in return for
concessions from Tehran, such as support for his new puppet
regime in Kuwait, whose ruling family was hated in Tehran. Or
he could threaten to execute or harm them, placing the U.S.
hostages in danger of retaliation, in an effort to blackmail
the Bush administration.
   For its part, Iran might be prompted to step up its
pressure on the kidnappers to free the six Americans, to
seize an opportunity to gain Western sympathy.

   Campeau Corp.'s
   2 Retail Units Post
   Widened Losses

   Campeau Corp.'s two retailing units reported a widened
total loss of $49.2 million for the five weeks ended July 7,
reflecting slow-moving inventory that had to be marked down.
   At the same time, the two units reported an increase in
revenues, although cash flow was slightly less than planned.

   In a filing with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Cincinnati,
Federated Department Stores Inc. reported a loss of $30.6
million for June, while Allied Stores Corp. showed a loss of
$18.6 million. The losses, more severe than the $27.3 million
in losses for the units for the four weeks ended June 2,
don't include bankruptcy-related costs.
   For the four weeks ended June 2, Federated had a loss of
$17.8 million and Allied had a loss of $9.5 million.
   Revenues were up at both units, a reflection of aggressive
store promotions. Sales at Federated jumped 24% for the five
weeks ended July 7 to $399 million from $321.3 million for
the four weeks ended June 2. Revenue at Allied rose 15% to
$209.1 million from $181.3 million.
   "Overall, the five weeks appear to have been a
constructive period," said Janet Mangano, an analyst at
Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co. "The bankruptcy filing was the
medicine they needed. I now expect them to show a profit in
the fourth quarter."
   But Ms. Mangano noted that the company's assumptions about
sales and cash flow will be negatively affected by the
continued slowdown in consumer spending.
   Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive officer of
Federated and Allied, said in a statement that the company
intends to continue cleaning out older inventory. In turn,
results will be lackluster "for the next several months," he
said. Mr. Questrom also said both units "can expect to begin
to realize the benefits of these changes in the latter part
of this year."
   The June results were positive in that the losses at
Federated and Allied were less than anticipated, the company
said. On the other hand, cash flow, or earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and before
bankruptcy-related reorganization costs, wasn't quite as
strong as the company had hoped.
   The units emphasized that they are confident that they
have an adequate amount of cash on hand to meet all vendor
obligations for the Christmas selling period.
   As of Aug. 1, Federated had $465 million in cash on hand,
the total of cash invested and unpurchased receivables.
Allied's cash on hand was $191 million.
   Several manufacturers said they were concerned about the
continuing losses, but they intend to ship Christmas orders
as received from Allied and Federated chains.
   Federated and Allied filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection Jan. 15.

   Fedders Corp. said it won't reach its sales target of $415
million this year because cool spring and summer weather hurt
the market for room air conditioners.
   The Peapack, N.J., company, whose sales totaled $216
million in the first half, didn't elaborate on the statement.
Last year, sales were $367.6 million, up 66% from 1988, as
net income rose 7.8% to $23.7 million, or $1.28 a share.

   Convenience Packaging
   Continues to Pile Up

<TEXT>
   ENVIRONMENTAL worries haven't slowed the launch of
convenience packages.
   Consider some new items to hit the store shelves: General
Mills sells Cheerios To-Go, a snack size pouch of the cereal.
Seagram's Tropicana Products offers eight-ounce cartons of
orange juice. And several companies sell applesauce in tiny
single-serve containers.
   Marketing Intelligence Service, a Naples, N.Y., research
firm, expects the final tally of 1990 new-product
introductions to reflect a 13% increase in products in
convenience packages, with much of the increase coming from
food and beverages.
   This occurs at the same time consumers express growing
concern over the environment. "Only a minority of consumers
are willing to make a change in life style," so they still
demand convenience, says Judith Langer, president of Langer
Associates, a New York market research firm. "Two
simultaneous trends are coming head to head."
   And convenience seems to win at the checkout lane.
Tropicana's single-serve cartons have been strong since going
nationwide in April. Even the 25% surge in orange-juice
prices since last winter's freeze hasn't hurt sales, says Bob
Urbaine, Tropicana's senior vice president of marketing. One
reason the product is a hit: "It's impossible to carry a
glass of orange juice to work," he says.
   The thermos must be passe.
                                                                                                       

   Sellers May Find
   Scents Make Sense
                                                                                                       

   IF AN AD for an Oldsmobile smells good, will people pay
more for the car?
   Sounds strange, but a Chicago researcher says pleasant and
foul odors can affect consumers' attitudes on spending.
   A study by Dr. Alan R. Hirsch, a neurologist and
psychiatrist at the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research
Foundation, asks consumers to describe their feelings toward
the car commercial, as well as a pair of Nike sneakers, while
different odors -- from floral scents to sewage stench -- are
piped into the room. Those two brands were used because they
are easily recognized by most consumers.
   The test, which will end soon, will show which smells
sell: "Odors will be the marketing tool of the '90s," Dr.
Hirsch says. "The easiest way to impact emotions is through
smell."
   He said several department store chains, along with a
Chicago jewelry store, also are testing smells in their
stores. Another possibility: piping smells into movie
theaters during the pre-movie ads. The sweet smell of cotton
candy, for instance, could be used to entice a G-rated
audience to buy products later.
   Previous smell tests show women generally like the smell
of flowers, while men rate the smell of a back-yard barbecue
No. 1.
   Meanwhile, folks at Oldsmobile are skeptical: "I'm not
sure how we'd use that," says a spokesman. Even the sweetest
aromas can't mask consumers' concerns on price, options and
service, he says. But consumers do seem to like that showroom
smell of new cars: "That's a universally well-liked odor," he
adds.
                                                                                                       

   A La Carte Hotel Services
   Make Bill Easy to Swallow
                                                                                                       

   DINERS LIKE a la carte eating, so maybe it could work for
hotel rooms, too.
   Studio Plus of Lexington, Ky., offers a cross between a
hotel and an efficiency apartment, with rates beginning at
about $160 a week. Guests pay the base rate and then are
charged extra for each trimming, even sheets, towels,
television and telephone. Maid service is $15 a visit, or
guests can borrow the vacuum and clean their own room.
   This month, the company will begin offering franchises
beyond its 10 locations in Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana and
Tennessee. Its goal is to move into the territory of its
rivals -- extended-stay hotels, such as Marriott's Residence
Inn and Promus's Homewood Suites.
   Studio Plus believes corporate travel departments will
choose the a la carte method to rein in spending: "A lot of
companies are looking at more economical options to house
people," says President Norwood Cowgill Jr.
   The company, which claims an average 85% occupancy rate,
figures it can win on price. Residence Inn and Homewood
Suites charge about $65 to $95 a night, with lower rates for
stays beyond a week. The chains don't offer reduced rates for
guests who want to skip the TV or phone. "People want
everything included," contends a Marriott spokeswoman.
                                                                                                       

   Debate Over Allowing
   National Casino Ads
                                                                                                       

   CASINOS WANT to advertise in all states, even where
gambling is illegal. But opponents say it's a dangerous
temptation for some consumers.
   "Casinos have been prohibited from advertising, and it's a
lost economic opportunity," says a spokesman for Sen. Harry
Reid who, along with fellow Nevada Democrat Sen. Richard
Bryan, is backing legislation to permit casino ads
nationwide. They figure if state lotteries advertise on
television, why can't casinos?
   Harrah's Hotels Casinos wants to advertise across the
country because many of its patrons travel to the tables from
outside Nevada and New Jersey. "We just want to reach our
markets," says a Harrah's spokesman.
   But opponents say the ads should be banned . . . or at the
very least, carry a strong warning. Arnold Wexler, executive
director of the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey,
wants any ads to carry a toll-free hot line, 1-800-GAMBLER,
where gamblers can get help.
   "There are 12 million compulsive gamblers in the country,"
Mr. Wexler says. And, with state lotteries proliferating:
"There's a big explosion coming."

   Circuit Breakers
   Help Keep Order
   In Market Rout

   NEW YORK -- A growing arsenal of financial market "circuit
breakers" has helped rein in program trading the past three
sessions and ward off the possibility of an uncontrolled
crash, traders say.
   But the circuit breakers haven't prevented one of the
sharpest sell-offs in the past two years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nearly all of the Dow Jones Industrial Average's
93.31-point drop yesterday came in the first 40 minutes of
trading. Traders said that investors big and small bailed out
of stocks from the opening bell onward because of growing
recession fears and grim weekend news from the Mideast.
   As selling pressure mounted, the New York Stock Exchange
announced restrictions on index arbitrage, a form of program
trading in which investors shuffle money between stock-index
futures and broad baskets of stocks, depending on which is
cheaper.
   The Big Board's latest restrictions took effect only last
month, after being approved by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. They kicked in once the Dow Jones Industrial
Average was down 50 points.
   Also in the first half hour of trading, another set of
circuit breakers took hold at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The widely traded Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index
futures sank to 12 points below their close last Friday,
automatically triggering a half-hour trading limit for the
futures at the Merc.
   Simultaneously, the Big Board delayed many program-trading
orders, channeling them into a special order network known as
the "sidecar."
   Big Board President Richard Grasso asserted that circuit
breakers on the Big Board and the Chicago futures markets
"worked extraordinarily well. They contributed to market
stability," he said.
   Index arbitragers weren't quite so certain, though. "It's
an attempt to try to calm the markets," said Eric Brooks, a
managing director at Susquehanna Investment Group, which is
active in computer-aided program trading. "I don't know if it
will have much effect."
   Other program traders said that regardless of the circuit
breakers, they couldn't do much trading yesterday simply
because many major Big Board stocks were slow to open. Stocks
such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Merck Corp. and others were
delayed 20 minutes or more in opening.
   In a market rout such as yesterday morning, virtually
every big stock trader becomes a de facto index arbitrager,
carefully watching stock-index futures (which allow investors
to bet on the movement of a stock basket like the S&amp;P 500
without owning the stocks) and avoiding big stock purchases
until futures and stock prices are closely in line. At times
yesterday morning, S&amp;P futures were as much as five points,
or 1.5%, below the S&amp;P index itself.
   "A lot of people are frozen," said Mark Loehr, an equity
trader at First Boston Corp. He said that the circuit
breakers "slowed the market's drop."
   Under the Big Board's new regulations, index arbitragers
are effectively precluded from piling on more sell orders in
a steeply falling market. Once the Dow industrials fall 50
points, the Big Board requires that any additional stock
sales by index arbitragers be done only if the most recent
price change in those stocks was an uptick.
   The Big Board's Mr. Grasso argues that the new rule could
help make index arbitragers more of a stabilizing influence
in a slumping market. That's because the arbitragers could
only sell into rallies once the Dow has fallen 50 points, but
they could buy at any time. But index arbitragers, who
contend that all of their trading simply helps keep the
market liquid, aren't thrilled about the curb.
   "It's their exchange; they can do whatever they want," one
index arbitrager at a pension-fund manager said. "This may
make people feel better, but it increases the cost of
trading. It just adds to market uncertainty."

   NEW YORK -- The U.S. subsidiary of Nomura Securities Co.
will be fined $180,000 and censured by the New York Stock
Exchange for alleged violations of exchange rules, according
to people familiar with the case.
   A hearing is scheduled for today to examine a settlement
surrounding allegations that Nomura Securities International
Inc., the U.S. unit of the giant Japanese securities firm in
1987 violated net capital requirements. These involve
situations where a firm allows its net capital to fall below
levels prescribed by the exchange.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   People familiar with the case said the violations were
relatively small, involving several hundred thousand dollars.
   As in most disciplinary cases, Nomura will settle without
admitting or denying wrongdoing, according to individuals
familiar with the case. A Nomura spokesman declined to
comment; so did an exchange spokeswoman.
   While not the biggest fine, the penalty would be one of
the steepest leveled against a Big Board member firm. Since
1987, the exchange and other "self-regulators" of the markets
have been under increased pressure to impose stiffer fines
for violators of market rules.
   Last month, the New York Stock Exchange censured American
Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. unit and fined it
a record $500,000 in a case involving Shearson's trading of
E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. stock during 1986 takeover talks.

   MNC FINANCIAL Inc., a Baltimore-based holding company for
commercial banks in the Washington-Baltimore area, said it
agreed to raise about $180 million through a private
placement of convertible preferred stock to Alfred Lerner, a
director of MNC who owns 8.9% of its common stock. Under the
agreement, other directors may subscribe to as much as 50% of
the private placement. MNC said the pact is part of the
company's efforts to strengthen its capital position. MNC's
debt has been classified as below investment grade,
reflecting a downturn in the region's economy and real estate
market. According to the agreement, the $180 million of
preferred shares will bear 12% quarterly cumulative cash
dividends. Each preferred share will be convertible into
common stock at a conversion price of $10.75 a common share.
The transaction is expected to close this fall, pending a
definitive agreement and regulatory approval.

   Made Recovery

   U.S. Data Show an Increase
   At 1.9% Annual Clip, Led
   By Manufacturing Sector

   WASHINGTON -- The productivity of U.S. businesses, paced
by an increase in the manufacturing sector, rebounded in the
second quarter from a disappointing first quarter, the Labor
Department reported.
   The productivity of all U.S. businesses -- output per hour
worked -- increased at an annual rate of 1.9% after falling
at a 1.5% rate in the first quarter. Nonfarm productivity
rose at an annual rate of 1.6%, its first gain in six
quarters. Manufacturing productivity rose at a rate of 3.7%,
somewhat slower than the 5.1% rise in the previous quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gordon Richards, staff economist for the National
Association of Manufacturers, said he was "a little bit
surprised how strong {the productivity figures} WERE,
considering how slowly GNP grew." The Commerce Department has
estimated that real gross national product, or the nation's
total output of goods and services, adjusted for inflation,
rose at a 1.2% annual rate during the period. "I think if the
productivity figures are correct," said Mr. Richards, "they
suggest that GNP may be revised upwards."
   But Priscilla Trumbull, senior industrial economist at
WEFA Group, was less optimistic. "It's a fairly bad report
for the non-manufacturing side of things," she said. "It
shows a weakness in a number of sectors, and yet labor costs
are increasing."
   The measure of the productivity of American business is an
important indication of the economy's strength and
competitiveness. If companies can improve their productivity,
they can raise employees' wages without raising prices or
cutting profits. Productivity increases can be attributed to
advances in technology that allow workers to work more
efficiently, a more highly skilled work force and increases
in capital investment.
   In an indication that inflation pressures remain, wages in
the second quarter rose at an annual rate of 5.9%, the most
since the second quarter of 1987. Real wages, which take into
account the effect of inflation, rose at an annual rate of
2.2% during the second quarter, the first time in seven
quarters that wages have risen faster than inflation. In the
first quarter, wages rose at an annual rate of 3.8%, while
real wages fell at a rate of 4%.
   The labor costs of a unit of production grew at a 4%
annual rate, following a rise at a 5.3% rate during the first
quarter.
   Donald Straszheim, an economist with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
says that inflationary pressures from the increasing labor
costs should be limited: "As slow growth continues, some
relief from labor cost pressures is expected, but not
immediatelyhefty wage increases were reported for June and
July. Still, better inflation figures are possible in 1991,
after the recent run-up in oil prices has worked its way
through."
   While the manufacturing sector's productivity rose, the
overall increase was tempered by a sluggish service sector.
The overall annual growth rate of 1.6% in the nonfarm sector
was far short of the 3.7% growth in the manufacturing sector,
an indication that services continue to be a drag on
productivity. The Labor Department doesn't publish separate
statistics for the service sector.
   The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.

   LAS VEGAS -- In an aggressive marketing move, Walt Disney
Co. will release the film "Pretty Woman" on video in October,
priced for direct sale to consumers at $19.95, but probably
available for much less from discounters.
   The announcement, at the annual Video Softwares Dealers
Association convention, was somewhat surprising as Disney's
other major hit this year, "Dick Tracy," was seen as a more
likely candidate for sell-through release.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Pretty Woman" is a modern-day fairy tale about a female
prostitute. The movie carries an "R" rating and will provide
an alternative in a marketplace glutted with the
child-oriented sell-through releases for Christmas, Disney
executives reasoned. The film is the biggest box-office hit
of the year, grossing about $165 million so far.
   The film will be only the third major R-rated release ever
marketed for sell-through: "Good Morning, Vietnam" and
"Lethal Weapon" were the others, and neither sold close to
the seven million to eight million copies Disney thinks it
can sell of "Pretty Woman."
   The pricing strategy is aggressive because most
sell-through titles are sold at $24.98 and above, and studios
put a minimum advertised price on them to prevent excessive
discounting.
   "The biggest film of the year at the most affordable
price," said Bill Mechanic, Disney's video chief. "I don't
think we're taking risks."

   Waste Management
   Stock Is Slammed
   After Barron's Item

   OAK BROOK, Ill. -- Waste Management Inc.'s stock came
under heavy selling pressure after a Barron's article
questioned some of the waste hauler's accounting treatments.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading of 2.8
million shares, the stock slumped $3.125, to $36.375,
slashing the company's market value more than $1.2 billion.
Despite the stock market's overall decline yesterday, Waste
Management said it believes the Barron's article was the
primary reason its stock opened yesterday morning down five
points, but James Koenig, chief financial officer, said that
by trading's close, the stock's drop was in line with other
growth stocks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Waste Management issued a statement standing by its
accounting and asserting that the article "flies in the face
of reality." The company also said its outside auditors,
Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. in Chicago, had reiterated their
support for Waste Management's financial statements.
   The article in Barron's, which like The Wall Street
Journal is published by Dow Jones &amp; Co., questioned a $70.8
million gain Waste Management realized last year when a
company it owns a majority stake in, Chemical Waste
Management, sold some stock. The article also questioned
Waste Management's practice of amortizing goodwill from
acquisitions over 40 years, the maximum allowable time to
write off such intangible assets.
   The article was written by Abraham J. Briloff, an
accounting professor.
   Both treatments are allowable under generally accepted
accounting principles. Waste Management said it had booked an
earlier gain related to the sale of some Chemical Waste
Management stock, and the 1989 sale had to be treated
consistently.
   As for the 40-year goodwill schedule, a spokesman said
that over the 20 years the company has made acquisitions of
local trash-collection businesses, many of those operations'
values have increased "significantly." On landfills, which
have a limited life, Waste Management writes off the good
will over a shorter period.
   "We want to reassure all of our investors that our
financial statements are comprehensive, complete, meet the
highest accounting standards and exhaustively represent their
interests," the company said.
   The combined impact of not realizing the Chemical Waste
gain and of writing off good will much faster could have
reduced Waste Management's reported profit for 1989 more than
$170 million, according to the Barron's article. Net income
for the year was $562.1 million, or $1.22 a share, on revenue
of $4.46 billion.
   Marc Sulam, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. who has
recommended Waste Management stock for several years, noted,
however, that the company has billions of dollars of
unrealized gains on its Chemical Waste shares and on its
landfill holdings. He said the company's lofty stock price of
about 29 times earnings is based on its leading market share
in a growing business that is difficult for others to enter.

   The Mideast Conflict:
   Bush Weighs Plan to Checkmate Iraq
   But Control of Oil Prices Is Big Bugaboo

   WASHINGTON -- Saudi Arabia is emerging as the lynchpin of
the Bush administration's effort to impose sanctions that
would hurt Iraq more than they would damage the fragile U.S.
economy.
   The task presents a dilemma involving hundreds of billions
of dollars. The effort to stop oil flows from Iraq is likely
to send oil prices skyrocketing even further. And surging oil
prices could quickly lead to an economic catastrophe for the
U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The solution, administration officials have determined,
lies with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis, by most estimates, could
increase their production and offset almost half the
shortfall caused by a boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
But convincing them to do so won't be easy.
   "There is very strong doubt they'd be bold enough to
confront another Arab state this way," says Shaul Bakhash, a
Mideast expert and professor of history at George Mason
University. "They {the Saudis} clearly are reluctant to be
seen to be helping the West in this particular way and going
against another Arab country."
   In addition, oil specialists say the administration must
be willing to use its strategic petroleum reserves --
currently 600 million barrels of oil -- to provide a
guarantee that oil price increases won't get out of hand.
That proposal, however, is provoking disagreement within the
administration.
   Some Energy Department officials are apparently willing to
use the strategic reserve to help guarantee that prices don't
rise too high. But the free-marketeers in the Bush White
House fear that's too reminiscent of 1970s-style price
controls, and they are reluctant to sign on even in this
wartime atmosphere.
   Among members of Congress, however, support for using the
strategic reserve to keep prices under control is building
apace. Rep. Philip Sharp (D., Ind.), chairman of a House
energy subcommittee, complains the White House is being too
timid. "It's a philosophy of being afraid to interfere with
the marketplace," he says. "They're afraid to control
prices."
   Eli Bergman, director of an energy policy group called
Americans for Energy Independence, agrees. "This is precisely
the contingency that the strategic petroleum reserve is
supposed to address, so why are they futzing around."
   The administration's anxiety over the economic effects are
evident in the roster of officials summoned to National
Security Council meetings on the Iraqi crisis. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, Budget Director Richard Darman and
Energy Secretary James Watkins have attended recent meetings.
And yesterday, Michael Boskin, an economic adviser, attended
the meeting as well.
   Iraq and Kuwait together have been exporting about four
million barrels of oil a day. Any successful effort to
embargo or blockade that oil thus would be a serious blow to
world oil markets.
   However, Saudi Arabia has additional production capacity
that it isn't currently using, which could supply between 1.5
million and two million barrels a day in additional oil.
Also, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela each have
600,000 to 700,000 barrels a day of excess capacity. If all
three nations boosted their production, they could almost
offset the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
   The challenge for the U.S. is to come up with a plan that
will convince the Saudis, in particular, to participate in
such a scheme. That won't be easy. Besides its preoccupation
with a possible Iraqi attack, Saudi Arabia is keen to avoid
appearing to be a puppet of the West.
   Saudi Arabia must take care not to stir up internal
political instability. And it can't antagonize neighbors in
the region with whom it will need to cooperate in later years
-- including the remaining members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, who seemed united in their
determination not to watch their production-limiting pact
unravel.
   "I'm afraid Saudi Arabia is going to find it very, very
difficult. . . . to increase its capacity to make up that
shortfall," said Michael Ameen, a former oil company
executive with extensive experience in the Mideast.
   But even persuading the Saudis and the other swing
producers to play along won't be enough. The U.S. also must
find a way to calm international oil markets. The fear of a
disruption in oil supplies already is leading to increased
demand for oil, as buyers hoard fuel to prepare for a
deepening crisis. Philip Verleger of the Institute for
International Economics calculates that panic buying already
has added another two million barrels a day to oil demand.
   The government's best way to prevent prices from soaring,
analysts say, is to offer to hold out the nation's strategic
oil reserves as a guarantee that oil will remain available at
a reasonable price.
   Administration officials say that option already is under
consideration in White House councils. But they caution that
they are reluctant to use the reserves to try pegging the oil
price at any particular level, because that would mark a
return to the energy price controls of the 1970s.
   The only way to assure an effective shutdown of Iraqi oil
exports, most experts agree, is to use force. A naval
blockade, for instance, could be used to prevent Iraqi oil
from leaving the Persian Gulf, or ports in Turkey and Saudi
Arabia.

   ANC Puts Down Its Arms
   In Battle With South Africa

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- The African National
Congress suspended its 30-year armed struggle against the
white minority government, clearing the way for the start of
negotiations over a new constitution based on black-white
power sharing.
   The announcement came in the early morning hours Tuesday
after a full day of talks between the ANC and the government.
ANC leader Nelson Mandela said his organization's
infiltration of trained guerrillas and weapons into South
Africa would be stopped immediately, as would all military
activities inside the country. In return, the government said
it would begin a phased release of political prisoners and
would grant indemnity to some 20,000 ANC exiles so they can
return to South Africa. A joint ANC-government committee will
work out the details and the timing of these moves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The marathon meeting in Pretoria -- the second
face-to-face session between the two sides since the
government unbanned the ANC and other opposition groups in
February -- seems to have cleared away the major obstacles to
full negotiations on a new constitution. Both the government
and the ANC say they hope these talks can begin by early next
year. In a joint statement, the two sides said they were
acting "in the interest of moving as speedily as possible
toward a negotiated peaceful political settlement."
   At a news conference following the meeting, Mr. Mandela
called the suspension of the armed struggle "a very
significant concession" on the ANC's part. And South African
President F.W. de Klerk said it marked an important turning
point in bringing peace to the country, which has been
wracked by racial conflict for decades. Since the unbanning
of the ANC earlier this year and other moves by the
government to end its policies of racial segregation known as
apartheid, the level of violence has escalated, both from the
heightened political activity of the blacks and from a
right-wing white backlash.
   Mr. Mandela and other ANC activists founded an armed wing,
called Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation, in 1960
following the government's banning of the ANC. A few years
later, Mr. Mandela and many of the ANC leaders not in exile
were arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment for
conspiring to overthrow the government. Mr. Mandela was freed
from prison after 27 years in February.
   During the years of its armed activities, the ANC
considered itself to be at war with the government. Its
guerrillas mainly targeted their attacks on government
installations and on those in the black community considered
to be government collaborators. Still, occasional bombs in
the segregated white residential areas spread fear among the
white community. In many shopping centers and cinemas in
Johannesburg, visitors are routinely body-searched before
entering.
   In recent months, the ANC's armed struggle has been
largely dormant, though the organization has continued to
move guerrillas and arms into the country. Last month, the
government claimed it uncovered "Operation Vula," an ANC plan
drawn up in 1987 to strengthen its underground in South
Africa. The police made dozens of arrests and uncovered
several arms caches, and alleged that it was part of a plot
by the South African Communist Party to overthrow the
government in case the present negotiations fail.
   After yesterday's meeting, Mr. Mandela said the Communist
Party, which is an ally of the ANC, also would be bound by
the agreement to suspend the armed struggle. The current and
former leaders of Umkhonto weSizwe are members of the
Communist Party as well as of the ANC.
   Despite the suspension of its armed activities, the ANC
says it will continue with its protest politics, which
include mass marches, boycotts and strikes, until apartheid
is ended and the blacks have a share of the political power.
Through these actions, the ANC is also hoping to keep the
loyalty of many black youths, who have been the main
supporters of Umkhonto we Sizwe. Mr. Mandela said the ANC
also will continue to press the government to restrain the
police in its dealing with black protesters.

   General Dynamics Corp., in yet another sign of weakness
among weapons makers, said it would cut up to 2,000 jobs by
the end of next year as it consolidates two of its
missile-making operations.
   The company's Valley Systems and Pomona divisions, both
based in Southern California, currently employ a total of
9,200. Overall, St. Louis-based General Dynamics has a work
force of nearly 103,000.

   "While we all welcomed a diminished threat from the Soviet
Union and the end of the Cold War, these changes have brought
unfortunate personal economic consequences for many people in
the defense industry," said Michael C. Keel, who has been
named vice president and general manager of the new
streamlined unit, the Air Defense Systems Division. "In order
to remain competitive . . . General Dynamics must more
efficiently use its existing resources and reduce overhead."
   The layoff announcement at the nation's No. 2 Pentagon
contractor is part of a giant wave that is rolling through
the arms-manufacturing industry. It is also a reminder that
even as world tensions flare with the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, defense contractors still face diminishing military
budgets and eroding business bases.
   The turmoil in the Persion Gulf "won't really have an
effect unless it becomes a full-blown world incident,"
explained Peter Aseritis of First Boston Corp., adding that
it still behooves companies such as General Dynamics to
"tighten up and buckle down."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
General Dynamics shares bucked the trend of a widely falling
market and closed at $30, up $1.
   The layoff news came after the Big Board's closing bell,
suggesting that despite the assessment of Mr. Aseritis and
many other securities analysts, investors still believe
defense stocks are a relatively good play now because of the
conflict in the Middle East.
   Just last week, on the eve of the Iraqi incursion, United
Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft engine-building
subsidiary said it would eliminate 4,000 jobs, or 11% of its
domestic employment, over the next three years because of
Pentagon spending cuts. Many other aerospace companies,
including Lockheed Corp., Northrop Corp. and McDonnell
Douglas Corp., also have been trimming their rolls of late.
   At General Dymanics, a spokesman said, corporatewide
employment already has dwindled by 1,150 positions in 1990,
and another 1,700 to 2,000 slots are expected to vanish by
the end of the year. Besides the Standard, Sparrow and
Stinger missiles made at the Pomona and Valley Systems
divisions, General Dynamics also assembles tanks,
jet-fighters and submarines.
   More than 600 of the layoffs at Air Defense Systems will
be the result of disposing of duplicate responsibilities as
the two divisions are joined.
   The company said that between its sites in the Los Angeles
bedroom community of Pomona and nearby Rancho Cucamonga,
where the Valley Systems division is located, it will have
more capacity than is required to meet its future needs.
However, it has not made any decision at this point to move
any of its production lines.

   ABA Assembly
   Votes to Rescind
   Abortion Stand

   CHICAGO -- Members of the American Bar Association voted
by a narrow margin to rescind a resolution the organization
adopted last February that endorsed a constitutional right to
abortion.
   The 885-837 vote by the ABA Assembly was passed after two
hours of heated debate, and will be considered tomorrow by
the House of Delegates, the policy-making arm of the lawyers'
group.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The House of Delegates, a representative body of 461
members, is the only group that can set ABA policy. While the
Assembly's vote isn't binding, the House is likely to
consider seriously any suggestion made by the ABA Assembly.
   The abortion debate has divided the ABA, which has 365,000
members nationwide. Yesterday's vote is being closely watched
by Washington policy makers because the ABA's judicial
screening committee plays an important role in evaluating
judicial nominees who will be voted on by members of
Congress.
   At a news conference yesterday after speaking to the ABA,
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh underscored his concern that
the ABA's pro-abortion stance could taint the ABA's public
appearance as a neutral evaluator. He said, however, that
since February there has been no evidence that the ABA
screening panel has used abortion as a litmus test in
evaluatating judicial candidates.
   If the House of Delegates fails to adopt the Assembly's
new position on abortion, the Assembly can take a second vote
and force a referendum of the entire ABA membership. Such a
move would be unprecedented, observers said.
   February's resolution recognized "the fundamental rights
of privacy and equality guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution,"
and opposed "legislation or other governmental action that
interferes with the confidential relationship between a
pregnant woman and her physician."
   Approval of the pro-choice policy meant the ABA could file
friend-of-the-court briefs in abortion cases. The ABA could
also lobby against legislation cutting back on abortion
rights. Since the vote, 1,500 ABA members have resigned in
protest.
   Anthony R. Palermo, a Rochester, N.Y., lawyer who proposed
the resolution that would rescind the earlier decision,
argued that the ABA should remain "neutral" in the abortion
debate. His resolution held that the ABA should not adopt a
policy supportive of a particular viewpoint "with respect to
constitutional, moral, medical or other questions involved in
a decision to terminate pregnancy."
   Mr. Palermo's supporters have lobbied for their position,
spending about $70,000 on pollsters, political advisers and
mailings.
   Proponents of the House's earlier resolution have painted
the debate as "pro-choice" versus "no choice." Sara-Ann
Determan, a Washington lawyer who lead the charge to pass an
abortion resolution last February, said yesterday that Mr.
Palermo's resolution "won't create neutrality; it would tell
the nation's lawyers that the ABA no longer supports a
woman's right to choose."

   Rubbermaid Signs
   Accord to Acquire
   Eldon Industries

   Rubbermaid Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to
buy Eldon Industries Inc. in a stock transaction that will
expand Rubbermaid's office products business.
   The acquisition, the company's largest to date, should
enable Rubbermaid to take advantage of the growing
service-related industry and the creation of more home
offices. The purchase also gives Rubbermaid a strong brand
name and more clout in selling to major retailers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under terms, each of Eldon's 9.3 million shares will be
converted into no fewer than 0.5438 and no more than 0.6320
Rubbermaid share. In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Rubbermaid closed at $36.875, down $2.625, giving
the transaction an estimated value of $186.5 million to
$216.7 million. The transaction wasn't announced until after
the market, which plummeted yesterday, was closed.
   The number of Rubbermaid shares to be issued will be from
5,448,000 to 6,332,000. The Wooster, Ohio, company said the
exact number will equal $23.75 divided by the price of
Rubbermaid shares during the 10 trading days ending three
days prior to Eldon's stockholders meeting. The meeting's
date hasn't been set, but Eldon officials said they hope the
meeting will be in November.
   The agreement is subject to Eldon shareholder and
regulatory approval. Rubbermaid said it has already received
commitments from stockholders representing 29% of Eldon's
stock. Rubbermaid also said the transaction would be
accounted for as a pooling of interest and thus wouldn't
affect 1990 per-share earnings.
   Eldon, which earned $8.6 million on sales of $112.6
million in 1989, has a strong brand name in a variety of
office products from plastic to leather and wood. The
Inglewood, Calif., company has a stronger presence in the
commercial market than Rubbermaid, which has relied more on
the consumer side of office products with its wastebaskets,
chairmats and files.
   "Eldon has a larger commercial business," said Jay
Freedman, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "Now when
Rubbermaid starts dealing with some of the larger retailers
it can go in with a much broader product line."
   Rubbermaid has been interested in acquiring companies that
complement its own product lines, have strong brand names,
and synergies in manufacturing. Eldon uses an injection
molding process, which is a Rubbermaid hallmark.
   Richard Agins, Eldon vice president and general counsel,
said the agreement "maximizes shareholder value and gives
Eldon more options for growth." He said the combination is
partly a response to the emergence of office product
"superstores." Analysts have said that such stores put strong
downward pressure on wholesale office supply prices. Citing
this trend among other things, Avery International Corp. and
Dennison Manufacturing Co., two large office products
concerns, agreed to merge in May.

   RUBBERMAID Inc. signed a definitive agreement to buy Eldon
Industries Inc. in a stock transaction valued at about $233.5
million. In yesterday's edition, the amount of the
transaction was misstated.

   Former Wall Street stock speculator Salim "Sandy" Lewis
agreed to pay $475,000 to settle a Securities and Exchange
Commission civil suit accusing him of securities-law
violations.
   The lawsuit, filed yesterday in federal court in
Manhattan, alleged that Mr. Lewis committed fraud and
violated record-keeping rules in connection with American
Express Co.'s sale of part of its Fireman's Fund Corp. stake
in 1986. The SEC accused Mr. Lewis of manipulating the price
of Fireman's Fund stock with the help of Jefferies &amp; Co., a
Los Angeles brokerage firm.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last August, Mr. Lewis, 50 years old, pleaded guilty to
three felony counts in connection with the stock-manipulation
scheme. He was sentenced to three years' probation and fined
$250,000.
   In settling the SEC civil suit, Mr. Lewis neither admitted
nor denied the allegations. His attorney, Theodore Wells Jr.,
said, "Although we believe no one was hurt by the trades in
question and there were no financial losses by investors in
the marketplace, the settlement was made to avoid lengthy and
costly litigation with the government."
   The SEC said that the $475,000 is meant to partially make
up for the effect of Mr. Lewis's actions on the market price
of Fireman's Fund stock at the time.
   As part of the settlement, Mr. Lewis also agreed not to
violate any securities laws in the future. Mr. Lewis, of
Short Hills, N.J., was formerly head of S.B. Lewis &amp; Co., a
securities broker and dealer.
   The SEC said that in the stock-manipulation scheme, Mr.
Lewis arranged for Jefferies to cause the price of Fireman's
Fund stock to close at a certain level on May 8, 1986, so
that American Express could sell its stake at a more
advantageous price. In return, Mr. Lewis told Boyd Jefferies,
then chairman of the brokerage firm, that he would make up
for any loss that Mr. Jefferies sustained on the transaction.
   At the time of his guilty plea, Mr. Lewis said he made the
arrangement with Jefferies in an attempt to counter the
efforts of so-called short sellers who were trying to drive
down the price of the stock before a planned secondary
offering.

   FREEZE ON SPENDING by Manville trust is extended until
Sept. 6.
   The order by Judge Jack B. Weinstein of federal court in
Brooklyn, N.Y., gives the asbestos personal-injury trust
additional time to restructure its financing. Last month the
judge had set yesterday as the deadline for the trust to come
up with financing changes to solve its cash shortage. But he
agreed to extend the deadline after hearing a report from
bankruptcy-court special adviser Leon Silverman, who said
progress was being made in solving the trust's money woes.
   The trust, which is independent of Denver-based Manville
Corp., was set up in 1986 to pay all asbestos personal-injury
claims against the company. The trust was the cornerstone of
Manville's bankruptcy-court reorganization plan.
   At a joint hearing before Judge Weinstein and New York
state Justice Helen Freedman, Mr. Silverman said discussions
are under way to come up with cash for the trust and to
reduce its operating expenses. Although he wouldn't disclose
details, Mr. Silverman said, "We have identified means for
refinancing the trust to provide meaningful funds for the
short term" without jeopardizing the trust's long-term
financing.
   Mr. Silverman said at the hearing that other changes are
being made to reduce the likelihood that asbestos victims
will take the trust to court, rather than settle their
claims. That would translate into major savings for the
trust, since litigation costs are its largest expense. For
instance, changes are likely to be made in determining which
claims are paid first, and the trust is seeking to
standardize the amount it pays on certain asbestos claims.
   After the hearing, Mr. Silverman said he thinks an
agreement in principle can be reached on the refinancing by
Sept. 6.
   Despite Mr. Silverman's report, Judge Weinstein criticized
the company's response so far to the trust's problems. "I'm
not convinced that management understands the seriousness of
this matter," said Judge Weinstein, who has authority over
all issues arising out of Manville's bankruptcy-law
reorganization. "{Manville's} management may not act as if
they are bound only by the letter of those agreements that
set up the trust."
   Thomas Stephens, Manville's chief executive officer,
declined to say what steps the company is considering taking
to aid the trust. But he said, "There is no higher priority
to the company, and we are giving it our full attention."
   Also, Judge Weinstein said he will rule on a motion
seeking a class action for all asbestos personal-injury
claims after a meeting of federal judges in Washington
Friday.
   The judges are meeting to come up with a national approach
to easing the backlog of asbestos cases in the courts.

   A FORMER BROKER WINS $23.4 million defamation award from
Dean Witter.
   The former commodities broker, who was fired from Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in 1982, successfully claimed that the
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. unit had libeled and slandered him in
filings with securities exchanges and in a statement to a
potential employer.
   The jury verdict, which includes more than $15 million in
punitive damages, is believed to be one of the largest
defamation verdicts in Texas. Two Dean Witter employees were
also defendants.
   Daniel Waite, who his lawyer says earned approximately
$400,000 a year, alleged in state district court in Houston
that Dean Witter filed false termination forms with the
Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and other securities and commodities
exchanges. On the form, called a U-5, Dean Witter claimed
that Mr. Waite had violated a New York Mercantile Exchange
regulation requiring the brokerage firm to know the location
of the commodities covered by the commodities contract,
according to Michael D. Sydow, Mr. Waite's lawyer in Houston.
   But, according to Mr. Sydow, a New York Mercantile
Exchange official testified that the regulation was only a
proposed rule. On the U-5, the company also wrote that Mr.
Waite was fired "as a result of this incident and
demonstrated inability to follow other company policies."
   In a statement, Dean Witter spokesman James M. Flynn said
the company is "disappointed and surprised" about the
verdict. "It has always been our policy to comply with all
regulatory requirements and to conduct our business in the
best interests of our clients. After careful review of these
responsibilities and requirements, we believe our actions
regarding this matter were taken in good faith."
   He said Dean Witter planned to appeal the verdict.

   A CAR DEALER FILED an unusual suit blaming GM for his
firm's collapse.
   The dealer, who had filed for bankruptcy-court protection,
alleges that General Motors Corp.'s GMAC finance arm set up
the "financial dismantling" of his 35-franchise empire by
pushing him to expand rapidly by taking on heavy debt and
then tightening the credit reins.
   In the lender-liability suit, Richard T. Pepe of Vineland,
N.J., is trying to establish that GMAC, in effect, became his
partner by arranging loans that covered more than 100% of the
price he paid for additional franchises in the 1980s. Mr.
Pepe, who said he paid himself $3.5 million a year, is
seeking $115 million from GMAC for his business failure.
   Industry officials fear such suits may become more common
as car dealers who became overextended in the booming sales
years of the late-1980s increasingly fail in the current
climate of lower sales, lower margins and higher interest
rates.
   General Motors declined to comment on the suit.

   NEW YORK -- This one is rooted in real economic problems.
   The big, scary stock-market selloffs in October 1987 and
October 1989 were triggered by program trading run amok or
buy-out deals collapsing. But the selling that has pushed the
Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly 183 points in three
days is different. This time, though trading has been
orderly, investors are facing the twin specters of recession
and inflation. Skidding 93.31 points yesterday to close at
2716.34, the Dow industrials were, once again, down for the
year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The tumultuous events of the past few days are shaking the
bond market, too. Most fixed-income investors are choosing
the safety of short-term Treasury bills. Meanwhile, the
prospect that rising oil prices will step up inflation is
casting a pall over long-term Treasurys, which currently
yield 8.79%. Yesterday, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
plunged more than 2.5 points, or more than $25 for each
$1,000 of face amount, for the biggest one-day decline in
over three years.
   Bearish analysts have been warning for months about a
slowing economy and what they saw as a looming recession.
Then late last week inflation was factored into the equation,
as Iraqi troops drove across the sands of Kuwait. The
invasion forced oil prices sharply higher in what appears to
be a prelude to widespread price increases on thousands of
oil-dependent products and services.
   Now investors, many of whom only a few weeks ago were
arguing about how far the Dow could climb beyond 3000, are
struggling to determine just how wrenching the anticipated
economic slump might be. Could oil prices double? Can the
Federal Reserve pump enough money into the economy to keep
unemployment below 7% or even 8%? In view of the inflation
risks, would it? Which investments can weather both recession
and inflation? How low might the Dow Industrials go?
   The answers aren't clear. Among the more bearish analysts,
a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 2000 isn't out of the
question.
   "I think there's at least a high probability that the Dow
will break below 2500," says David Bostian, an economist and
market strategist at Jesup &amp; Lamont who has been predicting a
recession for the past year. "Below that, everybody will be
getting pretty bearish. But I wouldn't bet my life that we
won't get below 2000."
   What is clear is that it will take months at best for all
the effects of slow growth and rising prices to filter
through the economy. So investors will be under pressure to
get ready for a long, uncomfortable siege.
   "Investors have to consider two things: what does the
market do and what does the economy do," says Abby Joseph
Cohen, chief strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. "I don't
know what the market is going to do, but whatever the economy
is going to do will take several months."
   The problems are by no means confined to the U.S. market.
In Japan, high interest rates had already clobbered Tokyo
stocks before the Iraqis invaded Kuwait. With the prospect of
costlier crude rattling a country that imports nearly all its
oil, stock prices plunged again yesterday; in less than a
week, the drop exceeds 10%. West German stocks tumbled 5.4%
yesterday, while London stocks fell 2.8%.
   In the U.S., yesterday's decline on heavy volume was an
acceleration and deepening of the selloff that sliced 34
points off the Dow Thursday and another 55 Friday. The drops
reflected a Friday report that unemployment had climbed to
5.5% as well as from the Iraqi move. Although at one point
Friday the Dow was down 120 points, investors took heart
after the Soviet Union said it expected Iraq to begin
withdrawing troops soon.
   The weekend brought no such indications of withdrawal.
Instead, Iraqi troops were said to be digging in while
simultaneously massing near the Saudi Arabian border -- a
threat to that even bigger oil supplier. Unnerved by news of
the routs in the Japanese and European stock markets, many
U.S. portfolio managers came to work yesterday in a selling
mood.
   "It looks like all the people who have been holding on and
holding on are capitulating," says John Brooks, a technical
analyst at Davis, Mendel &amp; Regenstein. "They're just throwing
in the towel."
   Selling pressures began building even before trading
opened on the New York Stock Exchange. At Jefferies &amp; Co.,
which trades listed stocks off the exchanges, Raymond Killian
Jr., executive vice president, says dozens of big stocks were
being offered for sale half an hour before trading began in
New York -- a sign that mutual funds were trying to raise
cash to meet many small investors' demands to get out of
equity funds.
   When Big Board trading did open at 9:30 a.m., several
large stocks -- including Merck, Procter &amp; Gamble and General
Electric, all components of the Dow industrials -- failed to
open because of order imbalances as portfolio managers tried
to dump them. Two of the Dow industrial stocks -- Boeing and
Allied Signal -- didn't open for trading until after 10 a.m.
   Nevertheless, the exchange called a news conference at
noon to say reassuringly that trading was progressing in an
orderly fashion. Late yesterday, Richard A. Grasso, the Big
Board's president and chief operating officer, said in an
interview that "we don't see any extraordinary measures
necessary" to prepare for today's opening. He added that the
exchange's systems worked well, commenting, "At least
logistically, there was smooth functioning of the markets."
   However, it was the Big Board's biggest stocks that were
hit the worst. As the Dow Jones Industrial Average had risen
faster than broader market indexes so far this year, it fell
farther in the past two days. It dropped 5.2%, compared with
a 4.9% decline in the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks
and a 4.7% drop in the New York Stock Exchange index, which
includes every Big Board issue listed. Analysts say the Dow
industrials' bigger drop indicated some panic selling among
institutional investors as they sold the biggest, most liquid
stocks in their portfolios.
   Not everyone is convinced that the economy is on its last
legs or that rising oil prices are going to reignite
inflation. Laszlo Birinyi, a stock-market strategist,
contends that the plunge of the past few days is just another
"market panic." He argues that selling pressure isn't as
intense as prices make it seem; rather, he says, prices are
falling because buyers are scarce. He thinks that at current
prices many stocks -- such as General Motors, with a dividend
yield of 7.2% -- are bargains.
   "If GM doesn't work out to be a satisfactory investment,
then I submit that we're going to have some really
substantial problems," he says.
   And James Severance, investment director for stocks at the
$20 billion Wisconsin State Investment Board, says the
pension agency has used about half of a $125 million cash
reserve to buy stocks in recent days. "We've been bearish for
quite a while, but we see some bargains developing in
individual stocks," he says. He is especially keen on some
airline stocks"they look awfully cheap" -- even though they
would be hurt by higher oil prices. He considers the prices
low enough to justify the risk.
   Even if the economy slips into recession, this doesn't
sound the death knell for stocks. The stock market hasn't
always had a full-year decline when a recession was under
way, notes Roger Engemann, head of a money-management firm
that bears his name.
   "To conclude that a recession would be bad for stocks
would be a mistake," he said in a letter to clients yesterday
morning. "Since 1945, there have been 13 years in which the
S&amp;P 500 profits declined. In one of those years, the stock
market was down modestly (1957). In the other 12 of those
years, stocks soared." Annualized returns in those recession
years, such as 1980 and 1982, averaged 22% -- "twice the
long-term average of stock returns," Mr. Engemann says.
   The optimists may be right, but more and more analysts and
money managers see things differently. While the market
rebounded handsomely after the October 1987 crash and the
October 1989 mini-crash, the pessimists see some disquieting
differences between then and now.
   After the 1987 crash, the economic environment was very
different from today's. In 1987, the economy was still
accelerating. Indeed, it was on the verge of a significant
expansion that propelled corporate profits and consumer
confidence sharply higher. Even after the 1989 tumble, the
economy seemed relatively healthy.
   Buoyed by that economic strength, the Dow industrials
recovered from both shocks. They hit an all-time high of
2999.75 on July 16 and 17.
   "In 1987, there was plenty of slack in the economy," says
A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research. "But this
is different. The economy is shakier, and there is a real
cost increase that is going to be felt by every consumer. It
will retard some of the progress that Europeans are making
and create some real problems for the economies of Eastern
Europe and Asia."
   Mr. Moore's biggest concern is the paucity of options for
U.S. policy makers trying to solve the problems facing the
country and the financial markets. Ever since the 1987 crash,
the Federal Reserve has been winning plaudits from investors
for its ability to shepherd the economy along. And even
though it might have seemed to be losing its touch in recent
months, the Fed still got high marks for its restrained
approach to monetary policy.
   Now, though, the supply and price of oil -- the biggest
factor affecting the economy and the markets -- is out of the
Fed's control and in the hands of Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
"There's a new price boss at the helm who is a hawk, and
that's bad news for the West," Mr. Moore says.
   At least some big money managers believe that the slipping
economy, coupled with the Iraqi invasion, calls for
drastically different investment decisions.
   No doubt, strategists will start taking down their
earnings estimates for dozens of stocks. The average S&amp;P
stock now sells for 15.4 times the past 12 months' earnings.
Arnold Kaufman, the editor of S&amp;P's Outlook newsletter, says
if stock prices keep falling, the price-earnings ratio could
be about 12.5 (times 1990 earnings) in the weeks ahead.
   "During the past eight recessions, the average earnings
decline from peak to trough was 22%" on the S&amp;P 500, Mr.
Kaufman says.
   Industry groups related to the oil industry and the
precious metals were about the only gainers yesterday.
Meanwhile, the top five second-quarter winners were at the
bottom of the pile. The medical/biotechnology group, the
best-performing group of last quarter, has fallen 8.75% in
the past three days. Commmunications companies, excluding
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the second-best group in the
quarter, are down 9%.
   Mr. Kaufman and other strategists recommend food companies
for recession-proof investing. But investors should have a
notion of how much debt these companies carry on their
balance sheets. Mr. Kaufman says investors are better off
owning food chains with lower debt levels, such as
Albertson's, rather than high-debt companies such as Safeway.
   In any case, the current turmoil is almost paralyzing
investors. "It changes everything, but you don't know how,"
says Roland M. Machold, director of the $30 billion New
Jersey Division of Investment. "The range of possibilities of
where this thing is going to come out is so great that you
have a tendency to just freeze."

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and the threat it continues to
pose as military and economic retaliation is weighed, is
forcing companies to come to terms with a future in which oil
prices may be higher, supplies more scarce and the world
economy weakened.
   Responses range from higher ticket prices imposed by Pan
Am and Northwest and considered by other airlines, fuel
surcharges tacked on by freight haulers and the likelihood of
higher utility bills as the cold months approach. The
following is a sampling of how companies are being affected,
how they are coping and what they think the future holds:

   AIRLINES
                                                                                                       

   Pan Am Corp. said it plans to raise domestic and
international fares by 10% starting this week as a result of
surging jet fuel costs prompted by the invasion. The New
York-based airline holding company said that it plans to
increase domestic fares Aug. 9 and international fares Aug.
15. A spokesman said that the average price the airline pays
for fuel has increased 13% to 69 cents a gallon from 61 cents
a gallon in recent days.
   Pan Am's move follows a similar proposal by NWA Inc.'s
Northwest Airlines unit. Last Friday, Northwest proposed
raising domestic fares $8 each way to offset rising jet-fuel
prices.
   American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., said company
officials were meeting most of the day yesterday to discuss,
among other things, alternatives in light of rising fuel
costs. A spokesman said an increase in the costs of jet fuel
of one cent a gallon increases the company's costs by about
$2 million a month.
   Glenda Hatchett Johnson, a spokeswoman for Delta Air
Lines, said the company has decided a fuel surcharge would be
premature. But she admits surcharges are under consideration.
"For every one cent {a gallon rise} in fuel costs, that
translates into an additional $20 million annually for
Delta," she said.
                                                                                                       

   UTILITIES
                                                                                                       

   A spokeswoman for Consolidated Edison Co., New York City's
electric and gas utility, said the price of low-sulfur
residual oil that Con Ed burns in its nine main power
stations already has increased in price to $23 a barrel, up
from $18 a barrel at the beginning of last week. Consumer
price increases are certain to follow, although the utility
will ratchet up consumers' energy bills slowly. Con Ed has
reserves of about three million barrels purchased at lower
prices, and is temporarily insulated from effects of the
soaring oil prices because it burns a lot of natural gas
during the summer months, when gas is relatively plentiful
and cheap. The utility is also planning to use more nuclear
energy in coming months.
   At Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., the nation's largest
investor-owned utility, events are being monitored, but no
special actions are being taken, said Jackalyne Pfannenstiel,
vice president of corporate planning.
   General Public Utilities, Parsippany, N.J., which relies
mostly on coal and nuclear sources for its energy production,
said it is in a "reasonable position" to weather the crisis.
But GPU chairman Standley Hoch said that, in the long term,
an oil-related recession may spur the company to trim capital
expenditures. Mr. Hoch said barely 6% of GPU's energy mix
comes from gas and oil.
   Philadelphia Electric Co. said it hardly will be affected
by the Iraq-Kuwait conflict because the utility depends on
oil to generate less than 5% of its electricity. Instead, the
company depends on nuclear power plants for about
three-fourths of its energy needs. A spokesman noted that the
utility was hit very hard by the Arab oil embargo in the
early 70s. "Let's just say it's a lesson you should only have
to learn once," he said.
   John Rowe, chief executive officer of New England Electric
System, Westborough, Mass., says the utility will react to
the Iraq-Kuwait situation by emphasizing conservation
programs that it helps customers set up. He says the company
already spends $65 million a year on such efforts, and has
scaled way back on its use of oil -- from more than 50% a
decade ago to less than half of that now. Mr. Rowe adds that
the oil problem "puts additional pressure on the already weak
New England economy."
                                                                                                       

   OIL AND RELATED FIRMS

   Sun Co., a major gasoline refiner and retailer, said it
discontinued sales of gasoline and distillates to
non-contract customers in the Midwest served by its Toledo,
Ohio, and Tulsa, Okla., refineries. The action was taken last
Thursday to avoid any disruption of supplies to contract
customers in the event of panic buying on the spot market,
said spokesman Dennis Byrne. The company isn't imposing
volume restrictions on its three other refineries in
Pennsylvania and Puerto Rico. The Radnor, Pa., company said
it doesn't anticipate shortages because only 4% of its crude
oil comes from Iraq.
   USX Corp. is busy trying to find crude oil for its
Marathon Oil unit. "Everyone is scrambling to get as many
barrels as they can so they don't run out," a spokesman for
the company said. Although the steel and energy giant is
monitoring the situation closely, no other extraordinary
measures have been taken regarding capital spending or
budgeting programs.
   Unocal Corp., the Los Angeles-based petroleum concern,
"isn't experiencing, nor do we expect to experience any
immediate problem from a supply point," said a spokesman.
   Similarly, Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., the
largest oil and gas marketer in the West, isn't planning any
extraordinary steps. Arco is largely dependent on Alaskan
crude oil.
   British Petroleum Co., Britain's biggest corporation and
the world's third-biggest oil company, currently doesn't
obtain any crude oil from Iraq or Kuwait. Three-quarters of
BP's crude oil comes from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North
Sea, the rest mostly from Abu Dhabi. "The embargo isn't
really going to have much effect on us," a spokesman said.
   Quaker State Corp. said it has no contingency plans, since
most of the crude oil it uses comes from the Appalachian
base. It does, however, expect the price it pays for the
domestic crude to increase with the foreign oil prices,
leading to an increase in the prices it charges on its fuel
oil and other products.
   David A. Harpole, spokesman for Lyondell Petrochemical
Co., said his company's Houston refinery processes about
60,000 barrels of oil daily from Iraq or Kuwait. That
represents almost 21% of the refinery's volume. Thursday,
Lyondell briefly reduced its capacity by 40,000 or 50,000
barrels when President Bush issued an executive order to
freeze shipments. The 525,000 barrels which arrived on an
Iraqi ship were released later Thursday. "We had our supply
and trade people quite busy rounding up additional supplies
of crude on the spot market to replace what was restricted by
the president's executive order," Mr. Harpole said.
   J.K. Riemersma, a vice president of Denver-based Hamilton
Oil Co., said, "It's a hell of a note when you're prospering
because of war." But Mr. Riemersma says the new-found
prosperity isn't prompting any budget expansions: "In this
business, the price can go down as fast as it came up."
                                                                                                       

   CHEMICALS
                                                                                                       

   An official at a major chemicals company, who spoke on
condition the company was not identified, said it was
checking ordering patterns to see whether customers had yet
started to build up their inventories. Noting that some
chemical plants are already operating near capacity, he said
some companies may have to come up with allocation plans to
ensure "equitable distribution of product" if a buying frenzy
developed.
   Other companies that rely on oil-based feedstocks were
more sanguine. A spokesman for Cabot Corp., an energy and
specialty chemicals concern in Waltham, Mass., said the
company is closely following the Mideast situation but not
yet forming plans based on it.
   "There is no particular panic," said John Edgar, a
spokesman for Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, Britain's
biggest manufacturer and the world's fourth-biggest chemical
company. ICI is watching the price of oil and the potential
impact of the crisis on world economic growth. But the
company hasn't pushed forward its annual fall budget review,
Mr. Edgar said.
                                                                                                       

   TRANSPORTATION
                                                                                                       

   Miami-based Ryder System Inc., the giant transportation
and business-services concern, topped off its fuel-storage
tanks nationwide after the invasion. David R. Parker,
president of the vehicle leasing and services division of
Ryder, which buys some 45 million gallons of diesel fuel a
month, also said the company has contacted all its major
suppliers over the past few days to make sure its supply
agreements are in place. Mr. Parker said the company has had
contingency plans in place for several years in the event of
an oil crisis.
   Federal Express Corp. says that it has rerouted its
Europe-to-Dubai flight so that it doesn't cross Iraqi
airspace. In addition, all of its packages that were bound
for Kuwait and Iraq via third-party carriers are being held
at its Mideast center in Dubai. Beyond that, however, the
express-package concern hasn't done much out of the ordinary
as a result of the Mideast situation, a spokesman says.
   Cannon Express Inc., a Springdale, Ark., trucking concern,
said it won't cut back on services, but would definitely be
applying additional surcharges on freight rates. The amount
of those surcharges hasn't yet been determined, but will
depend on how high oil prices go. About 25% of the 250-truck
company's operating costs are fuel costs.
   Leaseway Transportation Corp. executives decided that
diesel fuel for the company's trucks would rise by at least
10 cents a gallon, and have done some forward buying in the
spot market as a hedge. The executives also concluded that
the rise in energy costs may result in a recession, possibly
world-wide. Leaseway will be watching closely for any signs
that its major customers, including General Motors Corp.,
will be cutting back their hauling. If there are signs of a
cutback, Leaseway will pare its truck purchases and other
capital spending.
                                                                                                       

   ENGINEERING
                                                                                                       

   Parsons Corp., a Pasadena, Calif., engineering and
construction firm, has about 100 employees and their
dependents -- including about 30 Americans -- in Kuwait
working on three major projects for the government. It also
has more than 200 employees in Saudi Arabia. Parsons has been
unable to reach any of its employees there since
communications went down just after the invasion Thursday.
With the help of the State Department, Parsons has tried to
reach its employees there every hour for the past five days.
   Fluor Corp., a construction and engineering firm based
Irvine, Calif., has constructed several major projects in
Saudi Arabia and has a "significant number" of employees
there. Fluor and Parsons said they have parts of a project to
overhaul and expand Saudi Arabia's oil and gas production
facilities. Neither company would discuss the estimated value
of the Saudi contracts, but analysts have estimated that each
would get between $2 billion to $5 billion.
   One British engineering concern, NEI Parsons is continuing
work on a #70 million contract to supply Iraq with four
turbine generators destined for an oil-fired power station
north of Baghdad. The contract, due for completion in 1992,
is being funded by a U.K.-government guaranteed line of
credit to Iraq. "We have not heard anything from the British
government to make us alter our position on that. I'd rather
not speculate on what might happen," a spokesman for Northern
Engineering Industries PLC, NEI Parsons's parent, said
yesterday.
                                                                                                       

   OTHERS
                                                                                                       

   Gillette Co. sold $5 million of razors, blades and related
products to the Iraqi government through a bidding process in
1989, the last shipment of which was delivered early this
year. Relations between the company and the country have
recently been severed, said company spokesman David Fausch.
He added, though, that the trade goes both ways: Gillette
uses oil in the petroleum-based plastics in such things as
blade cartridges and disposable razors.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. security chief Bruce
Barr said that as of 11 a.m. EDT yesterday AT&amp;T's more than
three dozen employees were safe in several hotels in Kuwait
City and awaiting directions from the company on evacuation.
But he said AT&amp;T hasn't communicated directly with its
workers since Friday, relying instead on State Department
go-betweens. Mr. Barr runs AT&amp;T's "crisis-management center"
in New Jersey, set up two years ago to devise and distribute
detailed survival and evacuation plans covering each country
in which it operates. In Kuwait, the center is trying to
arrange vehicles to get employees out, but with
communications cut, Mr. Barr admits, "It's damn tough."

   UNITED MERCHANTS &amp; MANUFACTURERS Corp. (New York) --
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said it raised its rating on this
textile maker's subordinated debt, citing the company's
payment of interest arrears and its debt restructuring. S&amp;P
upgraded to double-C from D the rating on 13.75% senior
subordinated notes, due 2000, and 4% convertible subordinated
debentures, due in November. The rating concern also said
United Merchants' newly issued 3.5% senior subordinated
secured debentures, due 2009, are rated double-C. The new
debt was issued as part of the debt restructuring, in
exchange for a part of 13.75% and 15% debentures. About $170
million of debt is affected. Despite the debt restructuring,
a third bankruptcy-law filing is possible, because of
continuing poor operations, S&amp;P said. United Merchants'
viability remains questionable, without significant operating
improvements and asset sales, it said.

   Iraq Crisis Presents Bush Crucial Opportunity
   To Indelibly Define His Presidency and Future

   WASHINGTON -- George Bush is at the defining moment of his
presidency.
   With Iraqi troops entrenched in Kuwait, with oil prices
rising at neighborhood gasoline pumps across the U.S., and
with the new threat of an economic recession just before the
mid-term congressional elections, President Bush faces a
series of decisions that will color the rest of his term and
help determine whether he wins another one.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The president is going into a dark room now, and we don't
know what is going to happen," says John Geer, a political
scientist at Arizona State University. "This could be an
opportunity for him, but on the whole, this is the kind of
opportunity a president would rather not have."
   Eight years ago, Margaret Thatcher faced a similar
defining moment when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands.
She responded forcefully, won back the Falklands,
consolidated her position atop the greasy pole of British
politics and won for herself a reputation as a tough prime
minister willing to use force to protect British interests.
   Mr. Bush's problem is much tougher than Mrs. Thatcher's,
however. The U.S. is a third party but has critical economic
and diplomatic stakes in a crisis that involves a
militaristic head of the world's sixth largest standing army.
Mr. Bush's options, all of which almost certainly would
provoke enormous unintended consequences in a world hot spot,
are far more difficult.
   Although he has racked up impressively high poll ratings
after 19 months of office, his persona isn't etched very
deeply with the public; it's difficult for voters to identify
his fingerprints on the government. Whatever his actions in
the next several days and weeks, it is clear that the
challenge from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will have a
profound effect on the way Americans view Mr. Bush.
   "Three months from now we will have a very good sense of
George Bush," says Peter Hart, a Democratic political
pollster. "He'll either look strong or he will have begun the
slide down the slippery slope of public opinion." Edward
Rollins, co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee, adds: "This is the big moment."
   In the first diplomatic crisis of the post-Cold War
period, Mr. Bush's problem is to protect U.S. interests
broadly -- not only economic interests at home, but important
geopolitical interests in the Middle East and Europe. He
raised the stakes himself when he said of the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait, "This will not stand" and urged the world to watch
for his actions.
   For more than a year and a half, Mr. Bush has benefited
from events over which he had little control; he was on the
sidelines, for example, as Communist Eastern Europe crumbled
with unexpected speed and ease. Now events under which he had
no control are moving against him, forcing him to take
action.
   "This is a watershed in the Bush presidency," says Burton
Yale Pines, senior vice president of the Heritage Foundation,
a conservative think tank here in Washington. "He has got to
show that he and his people are beginning to understand the
post-Cold War world and how to use America's levers of
influence and power in that environment. It does not
necessarily mean going to war, but it means that you have to
be prepared to go to war. It also means we don't go to war
alone."
   Mr. Bush is contemplating his strategy in a political
atmosphere that demands a swift display of resolve if not
actual action.
   "If Bush just lets this drag out, it will hurt him," says
William Hamilton, a Democratic political pollster. "People
will see an effect at the gas pumps, and if there are real
worries about a recession, they'll be blamed on Bush. This
may be the most important week of the Bush presidency. People
are looking for a strong lead from the president."
   The crisis comes at a time when some of the familiar buoys
of diplomacy have moved, and Mr. Bush knows that he can act
to protect U.S. allies in Saudi Arabia and protect U.S. oil
supplies without worrying as much about a countermove from
the Soviet Union. Although that gives Mr. Bush some more
maneuvering room, he is still feeling his way in a new
relationship with the Soviets.
   "During the whole Cold War, the threat was that trouble in
the Middle East could escalate into a war between the U.S.
and the Soviet Union," says John Mueller, a University of
Rochester political scientist. "In this crisis there isn't
that danger, but there's the challenge of defining a new
relationship that could be quite productive with the
Soviets."
   Mr. Bush also faces a challenge not met fully by any
American president since Harry Truman: uniting the world's
democracies and others in a common goal. "That's Bush's
potential mission," says James David Barber, a Duke
University expert on the presidency. "In the past, he has
taken on major missions: going into the service despite the
objections of his father, taking off for Texas, going to
Beijing. This may be his presidential mission."
   Mr. Bush is contemplating his response in the knowledge
that, in the short term at least, he acts with the support of
congressional leaders. "We're in the immediate
rally-round-the-flag moment," says Stephen Hess of the
Brookings Institution. "There is nothing especially Bush
about his response: meeting with advisers, looking toward the
United Nations. By Labor Day, we'll know more about the Bush
style."
   If the result is a protracted stalemate, an unsuccessful
military mission or high loss of life, the president's
support could evaporate quickly.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley yesterday repeated that he
would "support the use of military force if necessary to
protect Saudi Arabia" but cautioned that the struggle with
Iraq might involve tactics like boycotts and blockades that
would take more time than a swift military strike and that
might call for economic sacrifices from energy consumers in
the U.S.
   "If there are risks," the Washington Democrat said, "it is
that we won't be patient enough, not determined enough."
   Before the crisis is over, it's clear that the public's
perception of Mr. Bush will be less an impressionism sketch
and more a realism portrait.
   "Everybody's been looking for a defining moment in the
Bush presidency," says Thomas Griscom, who served as
communications director in the Reagan White House. "His
challenge here is to take a decisive step."
   "He has to act like a president," concurs Harrison
Hickman, a Democratic political consultant. "This is as close
to it as it gets."

   W.R. Berkley Faces
   Charge of $10 Million
   Following Arbitration

   GREENWICH, Conn. -- W.R. Berkley Corp., an insurance
holding company, said it could face a third-quarter charge of
$10 million, or 84 cents a share, following arbitration of a
reinsurance dispute.
   The potential charge stems from an unfavorable ruling by
an arbitration panel involving a dispute between a Berkley
subsidiary and several of its reinsurers. The reinsurers had
refused to cover losses paid by Admiral Insurance Co., a
property-casualty unit of Berkley, on bonds that guaranteed
the performance of real-estate limited partnerships.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The arbitration panel's ruling requires the reinsurers to
cover some of the losses, but far less than Admiral had
requested. The lower-than-expected award would require
Berkley to write down amounts previously reflected as
reinsurance receivables.
   "We are disappointed in the award and are presently
considering our alternatives, including the possibility of
appeal or other legal action," said Robert S. Gorin, senior
vice president and general counsel of Berkley.
   In the third quarter of 1989, Berkley -- whose
subsidiaries operate in regional property and casualty
insurance, specialty lines of insurance and insurance service
operations -- reported earnings of $12.1 million, or $1.03 a
share.
   Berkeley shares closed yesterday at $36, down $2, in
national over-the-counter trading.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and its allies, having gotten a
pledge from much of the world to stop buying Iraqi oil, now
are laying the groundwork for a naval blockade to enforce the
embargo.
   After the United Nations Security Council voted 13-0 to
impose a sweeping ban on trade with Iraq, a sober President
Bush declared: "These sanctions will be enforced, no matter
what it takes."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a brief exchange with reporters, he pointedly refused
to rule out a blockade, and British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, after a White House meeting, said Britain would be
willing to consider a blockade if the embargo proves
ineffective. The U.N. charter specifically provides for
military steps, including a naval blockade, to enforce
Security Council resolutions.
   The resolution, passed to punish Iraq for its invasion of
Kuwait, also gives nations such as Japan the international
political cover they were seeking before firmly committing
themselves to cut off Iraqi oil purchases.
   Under one plan being considered by the U.S. and some of
its allies, the blockade would be manned by an international
fleet under U.N. auspices. The ships would stop tankers
carrying Iraqi or Kuwaiti oil out of the Persian Gulf or from
ports in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, where pipelines carrying
Iraqi oil terminate.
   President Bush plans to dispatch Secretary of State James
Baker later this week to Turkey in an effort to gain support
for the embargo and a possible blockade. Turkish Prime
Minister Turgut Ozal yesterday strongly implied in an
interview with ABC-TV that he would be willing to cut off the
pipeline, presumably making a blockade of his port
unnecessary.
   Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein, in a two-hour meeting with
the top U.S. diplomat in Baghdad, warned the U.S. "against
any act that might endanger the region's peace and security,"
citing Iraq's "high and unlimited readiness to sacrifice,"
the Iraqi news agency said. A U.S. official characterized the
meeting as "a mixed bag" of conciliatory-sounding comments
and tough talk.
   Despite yesterday's developments, the possibility of a
naval blockade of Iraq is generating controversy and
disagreement within the Bush administration. The Joint Chiefs
of Staff are cool to the plan, according to a source close to
Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the joint chiefs. Some
military analysts said that maintaining one for a long period
of time would be logistically difficult and would leave
American ships exposed to attacks from Iraqi aircraft and
seaborne Exocet missiles.
   And some administration officials say they hope a blockade
won't be necessary, citing the broad international support so
far for a voluntary embargo.
   As plans moved forward to cut off Mr. Hussein's oil
exports, his prime source of income, some U.S. officials said
they believe that cutting off food exports to Iraq may also
prove an effective means of putting pressure on Mr. Hussein.
The U.S. and Europe provide most of Iraq's imported
foodstuffs, and they have cut off such shipments.
   Iraq's allies don't produce enough food for their own
people, so should such a food embargo hold up, U.S. estimates
indicate that Iraqi citizens could begin experiencing
shortages of basic food commodities, such as bread and rice,
as early as October. "It looks like October-November would be
a difficult time; there will start being some pressures,"
said John Parker, an analyst for the U.S. Agriculture
Department. And judging from their apparent lack of
preparation for a possible cut-off of imports, he added, "I
don't think they realized how dependent they were."
   U.S. officials also continue to see the possibility that
Iraq will move beyond Kuwait to invade oil-rich Saudi Arabia,
which would likely result in an all-out war involving
American forces.
   American officials said Iraqi troops occupying Kuwait had
consolidated their positions close to the Saudi border,
moving in equipment that would be needed to support an
invasion, and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater flatly
declared that Iraq now poses a "threat" to Saudi Arabia.
   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney yesterday held hastily
scheduled talks with officials in Saudi Arabia seeking the
right to send U.S. planes to the kingdom. Iraqi forces herded
hundreds of foreign nationals, including 28 Americans, out of
their hotels in Kuwait and onto buses for an unknown
destination, raising the specter that he may be accumulating
potential hostages.
   Although it ships some of its oil from its own port
through the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian
Gulf, Iraq normally exports most of its approximately 2.8
million barrels of oil each day through the pipelines that
pass through Saudi Arabia and Turkey. While the U.S. would
like both those countries to simply shut the pipelines down,
both countries have reasons not to do so.
   Turkey gets half of its own oil from the pipeline. Saudi
Arabia, meanwhile, has a non-aggression pact and an agreement
with Iraq that would make it an act of war to cut the
pipeline. The Saudis are convinced that such a step would
give Mr. Hussein a strong pretext for either invading or for
attacking their oil fields.
   Thus, assuming the pipelines remain open, a blockade would
probably have to include the Saudi Red Sea port of Yanbu and
the Turkish Gulf of Iskenderun in the eastern Mediterranean.
Such an offshore naval blockade would let the two countries
tell Iraq that the matter is out of their control.
   Within the Bush administration, some officials are arguing
for a blockade on the grounds that the naval forces needed to
carry it out are already moving into place, and that it would
probably work without actual use of force. Few tanker
captains, these officials say, would dare run a blockade of
warships far more substantial than the small boats Iran used
in its so-called tanker war in the Persian Gulf in 1987.
   The U.S. has one carrier task force of 13 ships on station
near the Gulf of Oman at the mouth of the Persian Gulf and
another eight ships operating inside the Gulf, soon to be
joined by two British frigates and one French. A second task
force of 13 ships is positioned in the Eastern Mediterranean,
led by the carrier Eisenhower.
   A third task force of 10 ships headed by the carrier
Saratoga and the battleship Wisconsin, which has been
converted into a cruise-missile carrier, is heading for the
Mediterranean from East Coast seaports today, and includes a
Marine landing force. Pentagon spokesmen say its deployment
is a normal replacement for the Eisenhower group. In previous
crises in the Gulf, though, the U.S. has doubled up its naval
units, holding ships beyond their normal rotation.
   There were also reports yesterday that the U.S. was moving
B-52 bombers to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and to Oman,
putting them within striking range of Iraq. A Pentagon
spokesman refused to confirm or deny the reports.
   On his trip to Turkey later this week, Secretary Baker
will be carrying intelligence information designed to prove
that Iraq is prepared to move further against its Arab
neighbors. And he will pledge to Turkish leaders that, if
they aid the U.S.-led oil cutoff, the U.S. will stand by them
against any Iraqi retaliation.
   Under one scenario being considered, any tankers carrying
Iraqi oil out of the blockaded areas would be stopped by the
multinational force and impounded; the oil would be auctioned
off and the money held in a kind of escrow account. Such an
action, if it were carried out, is believed to be sufficient
to effectively shut down further Iraqi exports.
   During the Iran-Iraq war, the U.S. and Western allies
cooperated in the escorting of Kuwaiti tankers through the
Persian Gulf, and the experience "would be very helpful" in a
blockade now, says Frank Gaffney, a former Pentagon official
who now heads the Center for Security Policy, a defense think
tank. "We have considerable experience doing multilateral
escorting."
   Yet other analysts point out difficulties and risks --
problems that give rise to the reluctance of American
military officials to undertake a blockade. "It's a lot
easier on paper than in the real world," says a senior
Pentagon official. The Joint Chiefs haven't ruled out the
idea, he says, "but it's clearly not among our highest
priorities."
   Ships forming a blockade would have to be prepared to use
force on tankers, and even fire on them if necessary. That
could push into a political clash with the countries whose
flags the tankers are flying.
   Another problem would be distinguishing between tankers
carrying Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil and those with oil from other
countries -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and
Iran, for example, which make use of the same waterways.
Moreover, the Saudis ship their oil through parts of the same
pipeline system the Iraqis use.
   Iraq's Mr. Hussein, sensing that a blockade was being
carried out with the tacit cooperation of Saudi Arabia and
Turkey, might choose to retaliate against those countries.
Though Iraq has a weak navy, it has modern aircraft and
missiles that could seriously threaten Saudi oil
installations. (On the other hand, U.S. analysts say almost
all of Iraq's oil installations are now at risk from U.S.
carrier-based aircraft, which are believed to be within range
and carry laser-guided bombs that could inflict a great deal
of damage.)
   Other analysts worry that the nations engaged in a
blockade could be vulnerable to terrorist attacks from Iraq
or its sympathizers.
   A central player in U.S. military planning in the days
ahead will be Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander in chief
of the U.S. Central Command, who was part of the team that
accompanied Defense Secretary Cheney to Saudi Arabia. While
the team's primary mission reportedly was to seek approval
for U.S. use of Saudi airfields and military bases, the
officials were also to explore the blockade issue with Saudi
leaders.
   Gen. Schwarzkopf, 55, would become the overall commander
if Army and Air Forces were sent to join the U.S. naval
forces operating in the Persian Gulf area. A former top
planner for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Schwarzkopf is
considered an expert on the 10 years of planning that the
U.S. has developed for war scenarios in that volatile region.
   Those plans, which started during the Carter years under
the auspices of the Rapid Deployment Force, now focus on the
Central Command, a separate headquarters structure normally
based at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla. Generally
comprising fewer than 700 people, it could grow to over
300,000 men and women in a crisis, depending on the military
options selected by the president.
   At least some analysts believe it will take more than a
naval blockade to gain the attention of Iraq's dictator.
"What he really responds to is brute force," says Kenneth
Katzman, a defense consultant who until last summer worked at
the Central Intelligence Agency on secret profiles of foreign
leaders, including Saddam Hussein. "Economic sanctions are
long-term, and it's hard for him to grasp their effects."
   Mr. Katzman says "the best thing we can do is bomb his
airfields," which he thinks would cause Mr. Hussein "to fold
up quickly. . . . Right now he's feeling invincible, flush
with victory."
   Yet other U.S. analysts see real economic vulnerability
within Iraq, particularly in Mr. Hussein's ability to feed
his people in the months ahead.
   Iraq imports about 70% of the roughly five million tons of
wheat it consumes a year. At the last count by the U.S., as
of June 30, the Iraqis had only a two months' supply of wheat
in stock. Rice is also in short supply.
   The Iraqi poultry industry, a model of efficiency in the
Middle East, is especially imperiled by the boycott. The
chicken-producing industry uses about 850,000 tons of corn a
year, most of which comes from the U.S. But U.S. estimates
for this month show that Iraq has a backlog of only 22,000
tons.
   "Their poultry industry will run into trouble real soon,"
says Mr. Parker, the agriculture department analyst. "That's
been the leading success story of their agricultural
production."
   Shortages also are likely in other staple food products.
Iraq imports about 90% of its cheese, much of it from Europe.
Most of its meat, sugar and cooking oil also comes from
abroad.

   Margins, the good-faith deposits necessary to buy or sell
contracts, were increased by $1,000 on crude oil and
petroleum products to stand at $4,500 for customers and
$4,000 for clearing members. Natural gas margins rose to
$2,500 for customers and $2,000 for clearing members, also a
$1,000 jump.

   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved a
new Burroughs Wellcome Co. drug to treat premature babies
suffering from respiratory distress syndrome.
   The drug, to be marketed under the name Exosurf Neonatal,
provides a synthetic surfactant -- a soapy substance that
coats the inside of the lungs and keeps them from collapsing
when the infant exhales -- until the lungs can produce the
substance on their own. Exosurf is administered soon after
birth to babies on a mechanical ventilator.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   About 250,000 babies are born prematurely each year, about
50,000 of them suffer from respiratory distress syndrome and
about 5,000 die from the condition, according to Eva Kemper,
an FDA information officer.
   Tests of Exosurf have shown it reduces the death rate from
RDS 50% or more. In addition, the substance may reduce the
time babies must spend on artificial breathing machines.
   The drug was invented by Dr. John Clements of the
University of California, San Fransciso, and licensed by
Burroughs, Research Triangle Park, N.C., a unit of Wellcome
PLC, London. Under the Orphan Drug Act, which encourages the
development of drugs for diseases that afflict low patient
populations, Burroughs will have a seven-year monopoly to
manufacture Exosurf.
   Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, Ill., has developed a
drug called Survanta that is designed to achieve the same
results. Survanta, which is awaiting FDA approval, is made
from cow lungs, while Exosurf is a synthetic product made
from chemicals.

   TOKYO -- Iraq's conquest of Kuwait has stock markets
reeling around the world. But in Tokyo, stocks are taking
their second big drubbing this year.
   Indeed, some analysts now fear that the Tokyo stock market
is headed for a repeat of the plunge that wiped out about 28%
of the exchange's value in the first quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Amid growing concern about the instability in the Middle
East, the impact of higher oil prices and the possibility of
a monetary tightening by Japan's central bank, the Nikkei
average of 225 big stocks was off sharply Monday and Tuesday.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the indicator was down 1327.67 points,
or 4.6%, at 27271.86 at the close of the morning session.
Monday, the index had tumbled 916.23 points, or 3.1%, to
28599.53.
   At its levels Tuesday morning, the index now is 11,644.01
points, or 30%, below its record high of 38915.87 set on the
last trading day of 1989. It also is below the previous low
of this year of 28002.07, reached April 2.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 150 million
shares, down from an estimated 170 million shares Monday.
   Of the traded issues, losers outnumbered gainers 563 to
six, while 10 issues remained unchanged.
   "It's tough to see anything right now," said Mike
Morizumi, a strategist at Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia Inc.
"There are no cyclical patterns to look at."
   Japan's bond market also took a beating Tuesday morning,
with yields on the No. 119 benchmark 10-year government bond
climbing for the first time above 8%. That means the gap
between the bond yield and the earnings yield on Japanese
stocks, which now averages about 2.2%, is almost at an
unprecedented 6%, Mr. Morizumi said, adding: "Hopefully, this
won't last."
   There are similarities between Tokyo's earlier downturn
and the current one. Stocks have been highly volatile --
partly, some brokers say, because of computerized program
trading. And the fear of higher interest rates is driving
down the stock market.
   It was the Bank of Japan's decision to raise the discount
rate that turned a record-setting stock market rally in
December into a nosedive in January. The decline accelerated
in March after the central bank announced another increase in
the discount rate, which is the fee it charges on loans to
financial institutions.
   Now concern is growing about yet another rate increase.
Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait on Thursday, worries about
higher rates were undermining Japanese stocks. Japan's
economy is booming at about a 7% to 8% annual rate; money
supply growth is accelerating; and there is an acute labor
shortage in the country. In addition, a weak yen has been
contributing to inflationary fears. In response to these
factors, market interest rates have been climbing steadily to
where the yield on the government's benchmark 10-year bond is
at 7.94%, up from 6.75% in early July.
   The invasion of Iraq has all but ensured an increase in
the discount rate, economists say, by driving up world oil
prices.
   Japan depends on imported oil for 58% of its energy needs,
and any increase in oil prices could translate into
inflationary pressures. To avert those pressures, economists
say, the Bank of Japan is likely to raise the discount rate
-- it currently stands at 5.25% -- soon. The central bank has
no policy meeting scheduled for this week, but analysts don't
rule out an emergency decision.
   The timing of a rate increase, though, is critical. "We
don't know what would be appropriate," said Mikio Fujino, an
institutional salesman at Nikko Securities Co., "but it's
very, very important that it doesn't come too early to be
effective or too late to stop inflation."
   Analysts say the Japanese stock market has already
adjusted fairly well for the expected increase, even if it
proves to be as big as a full-percentage-point jump in the
discount rate. Still, investors are alarmed by events in the
Mideast because the investors fear that more conflict could
lead to tighter oil supplies and higher prices. That would
feed inflation in Japan -- and might prompt even another
interest-rate increase.
   "The invasion was bad timing for Japan," said Pelham
Smithers, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Asia Inc. "The
market had expected a short-term fluctuation in interest
rates, but now we have to make a correction for the new bad
news, plus continue the adjustment for what had already
happened."
   If the discount rate is raised, yen-denominated Japanese
government bonds would become relatively more attractive to
big Japanese institutional investors than U.S. Treasury
bonds, which are denominated in dollars and thus carry a
foreign-exchange risk for the Japanese. A quarterly auction
of $32.5 billion in Treasury debt instruments is scheduled
this week. To attract Japanese money, U.S. interest rates
might have to move higher even if there isn't a discount rate
increase in Japan, because market rates in Tokyo recently
have been rising, analysts say.
   With that background, reasons Mamoru Yamazaki, an
economist at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., "if the Bank of Japan will
raise the {discount rate}, it will be after the U.S. Treasury
auction."
   An increase in Japanese rates would hamper any easing of
credit by the U.S. central bank and might help send the U.S.
into a recession. Japanese government economists said they
aren't worried, however. Shousuke Tanaka, director-general of
the Economic Planning Agency, said that "even if there were a
recession in the U.S., I feel there would be very small
direct impact on Japan." Domestic corporate investment and
consumer demand are growing fast enough, he said, to sustain
Japanese economic growth. Economists point out that Japan's
economy is more efficient and more resilient than it was
during the oil shock of the 1970s.
   Mr. Tanaka also doubts that higher oil prices will have a
long-term impact on Japan's economy, and other economists
share his view. Stock market participants, however, remain
wary.
   "There is no ability to forecast what will happen in the
Middle East, and people tend to take the worst scenario,"
said Yutaka Nakai, a strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. "We
don't fear panic selling, but there aren't many fundamentals
to be optimistic about right now."
   In yesterday's trading, volume on the first section was
estimated at 330 million shares, down from 431 million shares
Friday. Decliners outnumbered advancers 997 to 30, while 34
issues were unchanged. The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all
issues listed in the first section slumped 76.14 points, or
3.50%, to 2098.53.
   The second section index plunged 198.40 points, or 4.51%,
to 4199.05. Volume in the section was estimated at 11 million
shares, down from 28.3 million shares Friday.
   Meanwhile, the Frankfurt market's DAX Index dropped 5.4%,
to 1740.93, off 100.01 points, and London's Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index was down 2.8%, to
2220.2, a decline of 64.4 points.
   Although West Germany gets less than 2% of its oil from
Iraq and Kuwait, the country still is heavily dependent on
oil imports. Britain, as an oil producer-exporter, is
somewhat cushioned from the current crisis.
   "The potential downside risk on the U.K. is probably less
than on any other major market," said Martin Paling,
international investment strategist at James Capel &amp; Co. in
London.
   But given the political and military uncertainties in the
gulf, few experts would predict near-term stock market
performance. "You don't know where an index goes in a war --
flip a coin, spin a wheel, throw the dice," said Thomas R.
Holmes, manager of institutional sales at Schroeder
Muenchmeyer Hengst &amp; Co. in Frankfurt.
   Added Mr. Paling: "The two big imponderables are how high
the price of oil will go, and how long the price will stay
up."
   The declines in London and Frankfurt were broadly based,
with few major stocks able to counter the trend. In late
trading in London, British Petroleum gained 2 pence to 367
pence ($6.81), but big losers included Imperial Chemical
Industries, down 52 pence to 958 pence; Rothmans, off 45
pence to 719 pence; Glaxo, down 25 pence to 762 pence; B.A.T,
down 30 pence to 541 pence, and Thorn EMI, off 24 pence to
680 pence.
   In Frankfurt, Deutsche Bank closed at 755 marks, down 44
marks ($474.54, down $27.66); Daimler-Benz, at 771.50 marks,
down 63 marks; Lufthansa, at 136 marks, down 11 marks;
Porsche, at 1076 marks, down 56 marks, and Siemens, at 688
marks, down 36.50 marks.
   The steep drops prompted some big investors to venture
bets that the bottom is near. "We did a wee bit of buying on
the {price} falls -- we aren't unduly worried," said James C.
Fisher, a fund manager for Scottish Amicable Investment
Managers Ltd. in Glasgow.
   Mr. Fisher said that on Friday and yesterday, Scottish
Amicable bought B.A.T, Glaxo and Hanson shares. "We saw an
opportunity to pick up cheap stock," he said. "Our market
will be supported by fundamentals. It won't go much lower. I
suspect we may get a bounce {upward} from here. But then
again, a lot depends on the gulf situation."

   Vestron Inc. said it tentatively agreed to be acquired by
Live Entertainment Inc. and will seek the approval of holders
of about $158 million in Vestron debt.
   The proposed acquisition marks the final winding down of
Vestron, a video distributor and movie maker whose fortunes
had soared with the hit movie "Dirty Dancing" only three
years ago. The company ran into debt problems last year after
the videotape market became glutted, as bids for movie rights
skyrocketed, and after $100 million in promised financing for
the company collapsed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Terms of the proposed sale weren't disclosed. Vestron's
chairman, Austin Furst, who holds about 85% of Vestron's
common shares, couldn't be reached for comment.
   It wasn't immediately clear whether Vestron, based in
Stamford, Conn., would operate as a separate subsidiary of
Live Entertainment, which is based in Van Nuys, Calif., and
is 48%-owned by Carolco Pictures Inc. Vestron in the past
year has sold overseas video-distribution operations and a
U.S. TV-programming unit. Its remaining assets include
distribution rights to 1,500 titles and the film-sequel
rights to "Dirty Dancing."

   Tandy Corp. introduced a six-pound portable computer,
equipped with hard-disk and floppy-disk drives and priced at
$1,999, the first in what could become a deluge of "notebook"
computers.
   The Tandy 1500HD is lighter and more powerful than the
1100FD model, introduced in September by the Fort Worth,
Tex.-based electronics retailer. Since then, the market for
notebook computers, slim enough to slip into a briefcase but
powerful enough to run popular business software, has become
crowded and competitive.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Tandy 1500HD raises the competitive stakes, analysts
believe. "It's a pretty aggressive price," said Liz Buyer, a
vice president of Needham &amp; Co.
   The computer comes equipped with a 20-megabyte hard-disk
drive and a 1.44 megabyte floppy drive. It uses a NEC V-20
microprocessor, a faster version of the Intel 8086 chip.
   Tandy said the computer will be available in Radio Shack
stores in September.

   Schering AG of West Germany, a pharmaceutical and chemical
company, said first-half profit rose 12% to 182 million marks
($114.3 million) from 162 million marks a year earlier.
   But sales, damped by strongly negative foreign currency
translation factors, edged up just 0.8% to 3.22 billion marks
from 3.19 billion marks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Buoyed by strong first-half profit growth, the company
upgraded its cautious estimate of flat full-year earnings,
saying it expects an improvement.
   Profit for the parent company, which includes domestic
performance and exports but excludes results of most foreign
and some domestic units, rose 12% to 137 million marks from
122 million marks. The parent's sales increased 4.4% to 1.69
billion marks from 1.62 billion marks. Its sales abroad were
up 6.1% at 1.16 billion marks, compared with the year-earlier
1.09 billion marks, and sales in West Germany rose 0.8% to
530 million marks from 526 million marks. On a world-wide
group basis, including the parent's results, foreign sales
were flat at 2.537 billion marks.

   Gold Prices End at or Near Highs for the Day,
   Spurred by Continued Tension in Middle East

   NEW YORK -- Gold futures prices rose strongly in moderate
trading, closing at or near their highs of the day in
response to the continued Middle East tension.
   The soonest-to-expire August delivery ended at its high of
the day at $384.70 an ounce, up $7.30. The most-active
December contract settled at $393.80, just shy of its high of
$394, for an advance of $7.40. Trading volume was estimated
at 34,000 contracts, down from 57,078 Friday.

   September silver rose five cents an ounce to $4.92 after
trading as high as $4.9350. October platinum edged $2.30 an
ounce higher to $490.40. It traded as high as $491.70.
   Considering gold's lackluster performance Friday, when it
traded over a $9 range before closing about unchanged,
yesterday's move was "quite good," according to Craig Sloane,
precious metal analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham.
   Reports that Iraqi troops were massing near the Saudi
Arabian border was the principal price-firming factor, Mr.
Sloane said.
   "The tension in the Middle East is growing, and it can
only go so far," he said. "Iraq doesn't seem to be giving way
under international pressure triggered by its invasion into
Kuwait, and President Bush is talking tough. Sooner or later,
something's got to give."
   An important factor for precious metals, Mr. Sloane said,
is the impact of the Middle East situation on Japan. "The
stock market there has been steadily dropping and is now
close to the level of several months ago when it was at its
weakest."
   Japan is a major buyer of precious metals. "But things
aren't going well for them in many ways. The boom in oil
prices could significantly affect their economy. The yen is
easier, and interest rates there are higher. If they decide
to pull back as precious metals buyers, the impact on gold
and, particularly, platinum, could be significant. Japan is
the leading platinum buyer. This could be why platinum was
such a lagging market," Mr. Sloane said.
   James Kneafsey, president of Cambridge Financial
Management in Cambridge, Mass., said the close at its high
for the day was "a good sign" for gold. "If it can continue
to rise, it can test $400."
   However, Mr. Kneafsey termed the advance "grudging," which
he attributed partly to the change in the Soviet political
posture. "In the past, a critical situation such as the one
in the Middle East would have had traders reacting with alarm
as to what the Soviet Union would do," he said. "That
unsettling factor isn't present at the moment. One indication
of this is that European currencies are strong, something
that would have never happened in the past in such a major
crisis."
   Ken Gettinger, vice president, precious metals, for Union
Bank of Switzerland, New York, said traders were reassessing
the Middle East situation, which accounted for slower trading
than on Friday.
   "Prices rose because Iraq didn't appear to be withdrawing
its troops from Kuwait, which on Friday they were expected to
do," he said. Other price-firming developments for gold, he
said, were the drop in the stock market, the weak dollar and
the strong oil market.
   "The strength in oil is causing the word `inflation' to
pop up more in people's minds," Mr. Gettinger said. "This is
causing traders to seek a safe haven in gold from other
investments."
   According to Robert Kwasney, editor of Kwasney Economics,
of Secaucus, N.J., the strength in oil will give gold only a
short-term boost.
   "This isn't an inflationary scenario, like in the 1970s
when the Federal Reserve was pumping money into the banking
system," Mr. Kwasney said. "Over the long run, if gold
continues to rise, it will be because of currently present
fundamentals, such as the fact that the Soviet Union has
stopped selling gold and that there is a potential for civil
unrest in South Africa."
   Rick Lawson, vice president of the Rhode Island Hospital
Trust National Bank of Providence, R.I., said buying interest
in all precious metals products has increased because of the
Middle Eastern crisis. This includes legal currencies as well
as bullion products, he said.
   "Demand for platinum products, which had been weak
recently, also has perked up," he said.
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices recovered from early declines to
end higher. The September contract rose 0.85 cent a pound to
$1.2635 after trading as low as $1.2280. The close was just
under the day's high of $1.2650. Some buying of copper by
Japan in London contributed to the firmer tone, analysts
said. One analyst, Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber, observed
that traders are preoccupied with the negative implications
of higher oil prices on the economies of industrialized
nations. The impact could be particularly acute in Japan,
which is a major copper buyer. If that buying declines,
global demand for copper could fall sharply, he said. "The
situation in the Middle East is very uncertain," he said. "If
it intensifies and major nations are drawn into a conflict
there, it is well to remember that copper is called the
`metal of war,'" he said. Copper is used in armaments
generally, such as shell casings, in transportation and in
communications. "If there is a broader conflict, copper's war
role could far offset any negative impact on copper demand
because of economics," Mr. Savaiko said.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices gained in profit-taking. The October
contract ended with a gain of 0.52 cent at 10.42 cents.
Demand for contracts largely consisted of purchases to offset
previous sales, according to Sandra Kaul, analyst for
Shearson Lehman Brothers. The October future's price dropped
almost 1 3/4 cents a pound over the past two weeks to as low
as 9.80 cents, and traders decided to take profits, she said.
The Middle Eastern crisis could affect Brazil and cause some
concern over that nation's sugar supply, according to Ms.
Kaul. "Brazil imports the bulk of its oil from Iraq, and it
claims it will continue to do so despite the attempts of many
countries to boycott Iraqi oil shipments," she said. Any
blockade of Iraqi shipments of oil would force Brazil to step
up its production of fuel ethanol to avoid an energy crisis,
according to Ms. Kaul, which "would absorb sugar earmarked
for export and cause concern over world market supplies and
prices."
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of soybean futures contracts
rose strongly in light trading on speculation of the economic
impact of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The price of the
November soybean futures contract rose 11 cents a bushel. The
price of the December corn futures contract settled five
cents higher a bushel, largely in sympathy with soybean
prices. Analysts said increases in crude oil prices caused
traders to speculate that foreign producers of oil may be in
a better position to buy grain in the future. Any hint of an
increase in foreign demand would have the effect of pushing
up grain futures prices. Some of the rally in soybean futures
prices may also have been in anticipation of Thursday's
supply and demand report for the soybean crop. "There's some
concern that frost could become a factor, although none of
the most prominent weather forecasters are touting frost
right now," said Mike Gazall, grain analyst for Refco Inc. in
Chicago. Because planting of the soybean crop was late this
year, an early frost could damage the crop, which would cause
futures prices to rise.

   La-Z-Boy Chair Co., Monroe, Mich., said it expects to post
a decline in earnings for the first quarter ended July 29,
because of weaker industry sales and poor performance by some
of the company's operations.
   Though fiscal first-quarter financial results won't be
available until the week of Aug. 20, preliminary indications
are for earnings "well below" the year-earlier 13 cents a
share, Charles T. Knabusch, chairman and president, said. In
the fiscal 1990 first quarter, La-Z-Boy earned $2.3 million
on sales of $117.7 million.

   La-Z-Boy, a maker of reclining chairs and upholstered
furniture, said that unless a "marked improvement in the
economy and industry sales" occurs, its fiscal 1991 earnings
also will decline from the year-earlier net income of $28.3
million, or $1.58 a share, on sales of $592.3 million.

   Petroleum prices exploded on crisis buying to the highest
levels in more than four years.
   Prices surged $3 to $4 a barrel around the world as Iraqi
troops occupying Kuwait appeared to be digging in on Saudi
Arabia's border.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the U.S., crude oil futures topped $28 a barrel, a
level of domestic petroleum prices not seen since before the
oil-price collapse of early 1986.
   Some oil analysts turned cautious, suggesting prices may
be near their peaks after the run-up of more than $10 a
barrel in recent weeks. But most said that if Middle East
tensions continued to escalate, prices could still go far
higher to close in on the records of the early 1980s of $30
to $40 a barrel.
   "It's a free-for-all," said Michael Rothman, vice
president and a senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets. "People are concerned not only about the
loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil but fear that Saudi Arabia's
production may also be in jeopardy."
   Global sanctions continued to tighten against President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq. An embargo threatened to choke off
from world oil supplies some four million barrels a day of
crude oil and petroleum products that Iraq and Kuwait had
been exporting.
   While industry officials were skeptical that all the oil
flowing from Iraq and Kuwait could be cut off, there were
indications yesterday that the embargo had begun to work.
Because some of the tankers that were to pick up Iraqi oil at
the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, Turkey, sailed away after
the embargo began, Iraq stopped pumping crude through one of
its pipelines there. It also reduced the flow of oil through
another pipeline across Turkey.
   These developments, combined with the rapid rise in oil
prices, also pushed the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries further into disarray. Over the weekend, some of
the OPEC oil ministers had indicated they might hold an
emergency session to try to take steps to slow the run-up in
oil prices.
   The idea would be for some of those with spare producing
capacity to begin producing above the quotas that have been
so controversial until oil prices began rising. And some of
the countries that want a more moderate approach to pricing
to protect their market shares of the future are understood
to have begun stepping up their output.
   Yesterday, however, OPEC's Vienna headquarters reported
that it hadn't been advised of any requests for an emergency
meeting. "OPEC is not doing anything," an official said,
"except to wait and see."
   Several oil ministers called, meanwhile, for adherence to
the production quotas that were re-established last month.
The July agreement had set a ceiling of 22.5 million barrels
a day for total OPEC production and brought the United Arab
Emirates, a chronic overproducer, back into the fold with a
higher quota.
   It's generally assumed the July agreement was nullified by
the fact that one Persian Gulf member of OPEC, Iraq, invaded
and occupied another gulf member, Kuwait. But Mana Said
Otaiba, the Emirates' oil minister, was among several
ministers yesterday urging continued compliance with the
agreement. He sent a message to Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil
minister and OPEC president, calling on all member states not
to exceed their quotas "under the current circumstances in
the {Persian Gulf} region."
   Immediate oil shortages aren't expected even if Iraqi and
Kuwaiti crudes are cut off completely by embargoes or by
blockades. J. Robinson West, president of Petroleum Finance
Co., noted that world oil inventories are at a nine-year high
and that demand for OPEC oil is less than the 22.5 million
barrels a day allowed under the production ceiling. But he
suggested major differences between the "actual structure of
the market and the psychology of the market."
   Whether warranted or not, oil prices leaped record amounts
yesterday. Some U.S. oil companies increased their field
postings, what their refineries are paying, for West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark crude, by a record $3.50 a barrel
to $26.50. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the futures
price of a WTI-like crude for September delivery jumped a
record $3.56 to settle at $28.05 a barrel.
   "What was a surplus in oil inventories only a week ago
suddenly is considered balance today," said William H. Brown
III, international oil analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   According to studies by Mr. Brown, a two-month disruption
in Iraq and Kuwait exports would carry WTI to a new peak of
$29 a barrel even if other nations such as Saudi Arabia
produce more oil to fill the gap. If others in OPEC don't try
to make up the lost supplies, "you are talking $37 plus for
WTI," he said.

   THE SECURITY COUNCIL IMPOSED a global trade embargo on
Iraq.
   The U.N. panel's 13-0 vote, provoked by the invasion of
Kuwait, was the organization's first total trade and arms
boycott in 23 years. To ensure its success, the U.S. is
considering an international naval blockade against Baghdad.
"These sanctions will be enforced, no matter what it takes,"
Bush said. In a bid to stop the flow of Iraqi oil, Baker
prepared to go to Turkey for talks. But Iraq shut one of its
pipelines in Turkey and gave arms to civilians in Baghdad.
The U.S. said 28 Americans were believed to be among a group
Iraqis seized in Kuwait.

   Dollar Falls Against Most Currencies
   As Investors Focus on Weak Economy

   NEW YORK -- With no new shocks from the Middle East, the
dollar fell against European currencies but rose against the
yen in nervous trading.
   Against its European counterparts, the greenback fell
below its depressed levels prior to Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. At one point during U.S. and European trading, the
U.S. currency dropped near the absolute post-World War II low
against its German counterpart. The dollar was briefly quoted
at 1.5685 marks, just above the historic low of 1.5615 marks
reached on Jan. 4, 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The yen outpaced the dollar's decline against the mark and
other European currencies, raising the dollar's yen price.
Japan imports all of its oil, and its decision Sunday to join
the multinational boycott of Iraq, from which 12% of its oil
once arrived, is likely to bring home higher oil prices
quickly.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.3300 Swiss francs and 1.5765 marks, below 1.3510 francs and
1.5935 marks late Friday in New York. Its close against the
mark was its lowest since Dec. 31, 1987, when it ended
trading at 1.5700 marks. Sterling was trading at $1.8725, up
from $1.8565 late Friday. The close was the pound's best
since the first days of 1988.
   The U.S. currency also changed hands late yesterday at
150.32 yen, above 149.99 yen in New York late Friday.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar opened for trading at 150.75
yen, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 149.50 yen. Meanwhile,
the U.S. currency was trading at 1.5775 marks; in Tokyo
Monday, it closed at 1.5763 marks.
   The situation around the Persian Gulf remained tense and
trading was described as nervous. Many dealers and investors
were said to have decided to sit out the seemingly arbitrary
activity. The dollar received regular but short-lived boosts
each time a new headline suggested the Kuwait situation won't
be resolved soon.
   In particular, the U.S. announcement that 28 Americans
were being held by Iraqi forces in Kuwait heightened fears
that the U.S. will launch a military strike. The news,
reported about midafternoon in New York, kept the dollar firm
for the rest of the session.
   But the precariousness of the U.S. economy has blocked
much flight-to-quality dollar buying. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average plunged 93.31 points to close at 2716.34
after having been down more than 100 points at one point in
the session. It was the market's worst performance since its
"mini-crash" last October.
   "I think the dollar's losing some of its safe haven
status," said Michael James, head of interbank dealing at
Midland Bank in London. "People are focusing on the
fundamental weaknesses" in the dollar.
   Added Kevin Weir, a New York vice president with Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, "Europe looks as much like a safe
haven as the U.S., and that is something we haven't seen
before."
   So far, the Swiss franc has been currency of choice. "I
think Switzerland is a safe haven," said Peter Connelly,
foreign exchange manager for Wells Fargo Bank in San
Francisco. "With its neutrality, its size, its banking
system, if you had a lot of money, where would you put it?"
   Commented Joe Sabbagh, chief currency and metals trader
for European American Capital Corp. in New York, "the Swiss
have always maintained a bit of a security blanket over their
financial instruments. And they're isolated from the game
there."
   Mr. Sabbagh noted that Switzerland is one of the few
countries that have held back from imposing economic
sanctions on Iraq, though late yesterday the Bern government
announced it was preparing sanctions that could be
implemented today.
   Along with its safety, the Swiss franc offers higher
interest-rate yields than other Continental currencies. The
base Swiss interest rate was set at 11% yesterday. The Swiss
National Bank said it sees no need to tighten monetary policy
to counter inflationary pressures from higher oil prices.
   A sharp fall in Japanese stock and bond prices due largely
to fears of higher oil prices and possible increases in
Japanese interest rates helped undo the yen.
   The same forces that have been buffeting the dollar in the
past week can be seen in the U.S. Treasury market, said Mr.
Connelly of Wells Fargo. The U.S. yield curve has steepened
considerably. Short-term bills have been bid up by concerns
about the Iraqi invasion and the increasing prospect of
credit policy easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Meanwhile,
longer-term bonds, including the 30-year bellwether bond,
have declined on the belief that a Fed easing coupled with
higher oil prices would allow inflation to fester.
   Mr. James of Midland Bank said weak U.S. growth is made
worse by the federal budget deficit. "I can't imagine this
confrontation will help the U.S. reduce its budget deficit,"
he said, summing up why the Mideast tension helped the dollar
so little yesterday.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$387.15 an ounce.

   SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- A psychologist's taped sessions
with the sons of slain Live Entertainment Inc. Chairman Jose
Menendez will be admitted as evidence in the sons' murder
trial, a state court ruled here.
   The decision by Judge James Albracht, which may unveil a
key piece of evidence in the celebrated case, overrode
conventional confidentiality of doctor-patient
communications. The judge accepted prosecutors' arguments
that Lyle and Erik Menendez, accused of murdering their
parents, allegedly threatened psychologist Leon Jerome Oziel,
thereby making the tapes a proper subject for court review.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for Lyle Menendez said both brothers plan to
appeal the ruling.
   Judge Albracht said his written opinion in the matter
would remain sealed until Aug. 15. However, he summarized his
view that none of the remarks were privileged because the
psychologist had reason to believe that the brothers were a
threat -- a threat that should be disclosed to avoid the
danger.
   Jose Menendez and his wife, Kitty, were shot Aug. 20 in
their Beverly Hills, Calif. Their sons alerted police, saying
they had discovered the bodies on their return from the
movies.
   However, the sons were charged with the murders in March,
and the tapes played a prominent role when Los Angeles County
district attorney Ira Reiner said they contained "very
important" evidence supporting allegations that the brothers
killed their parents to gain access to a $14 million estate.

   Industrials Fall 93.31 as Investors
   Continue Reaction to Iraqi Invasion

   NEW YORK -- The stock market turned in its worst
performance since its "minicrash" in October as Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent surge in oil prices
triggered another round of broadbased, heavy selling.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted about 105
points within the first 45 minutes of the session and
finished down 93.31 at 2716.34, its lowest level since early
May.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Everybody was kind of punched out after the first two
hours of trading," since the market's plunge "pretty much
happened right out of the gate," said Sid Dorr, head of
institutional trading at Charles Schwab &amp; Co., San Francisco.
   Among broader market measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock
Index skidded 10.43 to 334.43, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index fell 5.50 to 183.32 and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index tumbled 10.50 to 309.61.
   Decliners on the Big Board totaled 1,530 issues -- the
highest since Oct. 13, when 1,600 issues finished lower as
the Dow industrials plummeted 190.58 points. In the latest
session, only 255 issues moved higher.
   Airline and trucking issues were hit the hardest in the
latest sell-off; the Dow Jones Transportation Average closed
below 1,000 for the first time in 19 months, falling 58.76 to
980.29. The Dow Jones Utilities Average posted its biggest
decline since mid-January, falling 4.78 to 204.92.
   Volume totaled 240,400,000 shares -- down from the
292,360,000 shares which changed hands Friday and the
253,090,000 traded Thursday, but still the third-highest
total this year.
   Overseas stock markets once again helped set the tone for
Wall Street, as inflation and economic worries resulting from
the rise in oil prices sent share prices lower around the
world. The 3.3% drop in the Dow industrials compared with the
3.1% loss posted by the Nikkei index of 225 Japanese issues
and a 2.8% decline in the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-Share Index, a measure of London stock prices.
   Within the first half-hour of trading on Wall Street, two
Big Board "circuit breakers" designed to cushion market
declines took effect:
   -- The so-called "uptick" requirement for stock-index
arbitrage trading, which kicked in after the industrials had
lost 50 points. After that point, traders had to wait until
individual stocks rose in price before completing the stock
side of arbitrage transactions.
   -- The "sidecar," a computer file which handled all
program trading orders for S&amp;P 500 stocks for a five-minute
period. Once September S&amp;P 500 futures showed a loss of 12
points, those orders were diverted to the file and then
executed once the waiting period ended.
   Market strategists at several Wall Street brokerage firms,
reacting to the market's fall, recommended that investors
move some assets out of stocks and into cash.
   Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at
Merrill Lynch, doubled the cash portion of the firm's model
portfolio to 10% and lowered his firm's stock weighting by
five percentage points, to 45%. The other 45% remains in
bonds.
   Mr. Clough said he doesn't expect to lower the stock
allocation further, citing a belief that interest rates will
soon head lower again and boost share prices. The market's
response to developments in the Middle East "is getting a
little extreme, so you've brought down stocks a long way in a
short period of time," he added.
   At Morgan Stanley, chief U.S. investment strategist Byron
R. Wien increased the firm's recommended cash allocation to
20% from 15% and lowered his 1990 and 1991 earnings estimates
for the S&amp;P 500 stocks, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report.
   Joe Granville, the market pundit whose words used to make
tens of thousands of investors snap to attention, is
predicting a stock market crash within a few days.
   He thinks the industrial average will fall below 2200 by
month's end and, before recovering in the spring of 1992,
will drop below the October 1987 low of 1738.
   Mr. Granville lost much of his once-vast following in the
early 1980s, when he stubbornly refused to recognize the
great bull market of 1982-1987. But he has made several
astute market predictions since late 1987.
   Oil stocks remained among the market's few bright spots as
oil prices continued their rise, spurred by news that Iraqi
troops were amassing near the KuwaitSaudi Arabia border.
September crude-oil futures surged $3.55 a barrel in New York
trading to $28.05.
   Exxon rose 1 1/8 to 54 1/4 in composite trading of 3.5
million shares. Other actively traded oil issues included
Phillips Petroleum, which jumped 1 7/8 to 31 on 2.1 million
shares; Maxus Energy, which gained 1/2 to 12 3/8 on 1.8
million shares; and Global Marine, which closed unchanged at
5 1/8 as 2.2 million changed hands.
   Elsewhere in the sector, Chevron added 5/8 to 79 3/8,
Texaco gained 3/8 to 65, Mobil rose 1 1/8 to 68, Amoco added
3/8 to 57 7/8 and Atlantic Richfield went up 3 1/2 to 137
1/8.
   Precious-metals issues, which have also been climbing
since the Iraqi invasion, drew continued buying interest as
well.
   Homestake Mining rose 1 1/8 to 20 3/4, Hecla Mining rose
3/8 to 12, Placer Dome added 5/8 to 17 3/8 and ASA Ltd.
climbed 1 7/8 to 50 3/4.
   But the run-up in defense stocks since Iraq's invasion on
Thursday began to falter. General Dynamics advanced 1 to 30
and Northrop added 1/4 to 15 3/8, but Raytheon, which is said
to be selling or planning to sell its Patriot missile system
to Saudi Arabia and Israel, fell 1 1/8 to 62 3/4.
   UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, plunged 12 1/2
to 110 as the Thursday deadline for a union-led group to line
up financing for its $4.38 billion buy-out proposal drew
closer. A source close to the UAL board said the board likely
would grant the group an extension of "a day or so," American
Banker reported, but would be less likely to grant a longer
extension.
   Other airline stocks also fell sharply amid news that Pan
Am plans a 10% fare increase as a result of soaring jet fuel
costs, tied to the rise in oil prices. Pan Am added 1/8 to 2
1/8, but AMR, which owns American Airlines, tumbled 4 3/8 to
50 3/8; Delta Air Lines fell 3 3/8 to 59 1/8; Southwest
Airlines dropped 3 1/4 to 22 1/2, and USAir Group slid 2 1/8
to 18 3/4. Continental Airlines Holdings went down 5/8 to 4
in American Stock Exchange trading.
   The Amex Market Value Index went down 6.36 to 340.27, its
sharpest point decline since mid-January. Volume totaled
23,270,000.

close at 2716.34. That was the biggest one-day drop since
October's "minicrash." Stock prices also fell sharply in
Japan, which imports nearly all its oil, as well as in
Britain, Germany, Spain, and France.

   Yesterday's financial markets were "tumultuous and scary,"
said John Rosenthal, senior partner at Silberberg, Rosenthal
&amp; Co., a New York brokerage firm. However, "It absolutely
didn't feel like Oct. 19 or 20, 1987. At no time was there
panic selling," said Donald Stone, vice chairman of the New
York Stock Exchange and senior partner at Lasker, Stone and
Stern. "But it felt like the market was under real pressure."
   So were bonds. Fearing that higher oil prices will sharply
accelerate inflation, investors bailed out of long-term
bonds. In the biggest rout in about three years, Treasury
bond prices plummeted 2 5/8 points, or $26.25 for each $1,000
face amount. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds climbed to
8.80% from 8.56% late Friday. Bond yields also jumped in most
major international markets, including Britain, Japan and
Germany.
   Many "junk" bonds -- high-yielding, high-risk bonds issued
by companies with low credit ratings or no ratings at all --
also were hard hit. Investors fear a recession could
undermine companies with heavy debt burdens.
   Even municipal bonds, typically among the quietest, least
volatile securities, were dragged into the bond market's
descent. Prices of many tax-free bond issues tumbled as much
as 1 1/2 points.
   All major financial markets vibrated to the same tune:
"Fear of a wider Middle East conflagration," said Robert
Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
"People are afraid of an attack on Saudi Arabia, which would
probably cause much greater disruption of oil flows," said
Mr. Hormats, a former State Department official. "The
consequences would be shattering."
   Investors seeking a financial bomb shelter turned for
protection to short-term Treasury bills, noted for safety.
Individual investors flooded the Treasury with a huge wave of
orders at yesterday's regular weekly government auction of
short-term bills. Rates fell sharply from a week earlier on
both three-month and six-month Treasury bills.
   Investors also rushed to buy gold, stocks of precious
metals and mining companies, as well as shares of oil
producers and several defense contractors.
   But surging interest rates hammered utility stocks.
Utilities are heavy borrowers, and their stock prices are
very sensitive to interest rate changes. The Dow Jones
Utility Average fell 4.78 points to 204.92.
   Rising oil prices pummeled transportation stocks,
especially trucking and airline issues. The Dow Jones
Transportation Average sank 58.76 to 980.29.
   Smaller stocks tended to be hurt more than big ones. While
the Dow industrials fell 3.3%, the Nasdaq composite index of
over-the-counter stocks plunged 4.2%.
   The Big Board held a hastily arranged news conference to
assure investors that the stock market was humming along just
fine. Asked why more than a dozen major stocks didn't open
for trading at the 9:30 a.m. EDT opening bell, Richard
Torrenzano, an exchange spokesman, said it was more important
that 28 of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrials opened
within a half hour. "That's quite good" under the
circumstances, he said.
   In foreign-exchange trading, the dollar fell sharply
against most major currencies, although it rose slightly
against the yen. Traders said worries that higher oil prices
will further slow an already limping U.S. economy, coupled
with concern about tumbling U.S. bond and stock prices,
overshadowed the dollar's status as a safe-haven investment.
The dollar also was hurt by worries that higher oil prices
will mean even bigger U.S. budget and trade deficits.
   At one point yesterday, the dollar dropped to just above
its record post-World War II low against the German mark of
1.5615 marks, set in January 1988.
   Some traders had hoped that the Federal Reserve would try
to restore calm to the shaky markets and bolster the sagging
U.S. economy by easing credit another notch. But the Fed
didn't take any such action.
   Fed officials face a tough choice. If they drive down
short-term rates to calm market jitters, they run a large
risk of intensifying inflation fears, which could further
undermine the markets.
   The bond market slump comes at a bad time for the U.S.
government. This week, the Treasury is scheduled to sell a
record $32.25 billion of new notes and bonds to pay the
government's bills. The bond market's sudden sinking spell
means the Treasury will have to pay substantially higher
interest rates to attract investors.
   Some traders think the Treasury will have to offer yields
of nearly 9% on the 30-year bonds tentatively slated for sale
Thursday, up from 8.5% since Friday and the highest since
early spring. Today, the Treasury is scheduled to sell new
three-year notes. Bond specialists estimate the notes will be
sold at an average annual yield of about 8% to 8 1/8%, up
from 7.94% on Friday.
   In major markets:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices tumbled. Declining Big Board stocks
outnumbered advancing issues by 1,530 to 255.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell sharply. The Treasury's 30-year bonds
fell to 99 10/32 from 101 30/32 Friday.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar slumped against most major currencies. In late
New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5765 German
marks from 1.5935 marks late Friday. But the dollar was
quoted at 150.32 Japanese yen, up from 149.99.

   The Mideast Crisis:
   Insurers Face Huge Risk in Persian Gulf;
   Coverage, if Available, May Get Costlier

   Government export insurers and some private insurers could
have billions of dollars at risk in the Persian Gulf if
hostilities in the region escalate further. In addition,
companies seeking to do business there may have to pay dearly
for insurance coverage, if it's still available.
   Insurance rates for shipping through the Persian Gulf have
risen sharply since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last Thursday.
Lloyd's of London, a big British insurance marketer, has led
a world-wide round of price increases for certain oil and
marine coverage. Lloyd's also has posted a war-risk premium
on Persian Gulf shipping for the first time since the
Iran-Iraq war.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Aside from shipping, companies already doing business in
the region probably won't see their premiums shoot up
immediately. But if the Gulf conflict continues for several
months, their insurance costs could be affected in January,
when insurance renewals are typically negotiated.
   The market for political-risk coverage in Iraq and Kuwait
has virtually shut down, brokers and underwriters said. "I
wouldn't have the audacity to ask an underwriter for a
quote," said Anthony Palmer, a managing director of Berry
Palmer &amp; Lyle, Ltd., a Lloyd's of London broker that
specializes in political-risk coverage.
   Yet, depending on the project and amount of risk involved,
underwriters might still be willing to provide political-risk
coverage for companies seeking business in Saudi Arabia and
other parts of the region, said Ken Horne, a vice president
who heads the political-risk department for Johnson &amp;
Higgins, a New York-based broker.
   Mr. Horne noted that when Chinese army tanks moved to
crush the student protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in
June last year, rates for political-risk coverage in China
virtually doubled overnight. They stabilized within about a
month after the crisis.
   "I wouldn't rule out a 100% rate increase versus {levels
seen} two weeks ago" for political-risk coverage in the
Persian Gulf region, with rates leveling off after a while,
Mr. Horne said.
   Oil and construction companies, manufacturers, exporters
and distributors doing business with Iraq, Kuwait and other
nations in the region tend to buy coverage against such
political risks as an import/export embargo, expropriation or
nationalization of property. But political-risk insurance
generally doesn't cover property damage extending from any
conflict.
   Brokers and underwriters recall that the eight-year
Persian Gulf War cost insurers around the world several
billion dollars, including export guarantees. Marine insurers
alone paid out about $1 billion as a result of that war, the
brokers said.
   Lloyd's, firms in the London insurance market,
underwriters in a few other countries, such as France, and
some U.S. insurers, such as New York-based American
International Group Inc., provide the bulk of political-risk
and marine coverage.
   Maurice Greenberg, chairman and chief executive officer of
American International, said the company has little risk
exposure in the Persian Gulf region. "We have been involved
in the region for many years and we have managed our
exposures quite well. This {situation} will be no exception,"
he said.
   Lloyd's said its underwriters are currently charging an
additional premium of 0.025% of the insured value of ships
traveling in the Persian Gulf. That means owners of a ship
insured for $20 million, a typical value for a supertanker,
will pay $5,000 extra for two weeks' insurance coverage in
the region. Ship owners previously were paying about $10,000
for a full year's coverage.
   Rates can be significantly higher for ships going to
Kuwait, Iraq or northern ports in Saudi Arabia. Insurers are
charging $100,000 extra for a week of coverage in those
areas. Underwriters also are free to demand higher rates if
they judge the risks to be greater.
   Government agencies in the U.S., Britain and several other
European countries provide trade-related guarantees to
exporters.
   The U.S. Export-Import Bank, which provides coverage for
U.S. exporters and banks, has about $80 million to $100
million of potential exposure in Iraq from trade-guarantees
it has offered. However, some Ex-Im Bank guarantees might be
jeopardized by the U.S. government's embargo against Iraq.
Exposure in Kuwait is less than $10 million and about $15
million for Saudi Arabia, an agency official said. The agency
is reviewing its policies for Iraq and Kuwait.
   The Overseas Private Investment Corp., a U.S. agency that
insures companies investing in developing nations, said it
covers several projects in Kuwait, but declined to specify
the amount of its exposure. It does no business in Iraq. OPIC
is also active in Saudi Arabia, providing coverage for more
than 12 projects and with total exposure of about $40 million
to $50 million.
   The British Export Credits Guarantee Department, the
British counterpart of the Export-Import Bank, said it
stopped writing new business bound for Iraq in April, when
the Iraqis slid into a payment crisis and the agency started
to see claims. Sources believe that Britain's ECGD has
extended about $1 billion in trade-related guarantees to
Iraq, but the agency didn't confirm this amount.

   LOS ANGELES -- An investor has sued Management Co.
Entertainment Group Inc. and five of its current and former
officers and directors for allegedly issuing misleading
statements and failing to disclose the company's precarious
financial condition.
   Elfriede Glancy, in a complaint that seeks class action
status in federal court here, charged that the entertainment
company failed to disclose that it was struggling to avoid
bankruptcy and was having trouble arranging financing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suit claims the company's problems were not reflected
in its 1989 annual report and its 10-K report to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Officials at MCEG weren't
available for comment.
   The suit alleges that MCEG failed to report that it would
not be able to adequately fund and operate its business after
a proposed acquisition of distributor Virgin Vision Ltd. for
approximately $83 million.
   MCEG said in July that it was negotiating a standstill
agreement with G.E. Capital, a unit of General Electric Co.
in connection with $72.5 million in loans that are past due.
The company borrowed that amount as part of its financing for
the acquisition last year of Virgin Vision, an independent
movie television and video distributor.
   The company said it is currently working on restructuring
those loans. However, in a July filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the company said if it is unable to
reach an agreement on restructuring the loans, it could be
required to seek protection from creditors under federal
bankruptcy laws.
   The suit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages.

   Former Bush Aide
   Agrees to Testify
   In Thrift Inquiry

   WASHINGTON -- Robert Thompson, a lobbyist and former aide
to President Bush, dropped his defiance of a Senate
subcommittee subpoena and appeared yesterday to defend his
role in helping an Arizona insurance executive buy 15
insolvent savings and loans from the government in 1988.
   While still maintaining that Sen. Howard Metzenbaum's
antitrust subcommittee has no jurisdiction in the matter, Mr.
Thompson said, "I do not want to give anyone any excuse to
say that my absence from these proceedings indicates I have
something to hide. Far from it." Mr. Thompson had previously
said he planned to battle the subcommittee's subpoena in
court.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Arizona executive, James Fail, also appeared and said
that he invested in the thrifts because "I thought I could
contribute to the resolution of the greatest financial
disaster to strike this country since the Great Depression."
   Mr. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, has been conducting an
inquiry into the December 1988 sale of the thrifts to Mr.
Fail, and has raised questions about whether Mr. Fail
properly disclosed to regulators legal problems an insurance
company he controlled faced in 1976 in Alabama. On certain
forms filed with the regulators, Mr. Fail noted that
securities fraud charges brought against him individually
were dismissed, but he didn't indicate that one of his
companies pleaded guilty to fraud and paid a $5,000 fine.
   A top savings and loan regulator said at a hearing last
week that if he had known about the guilty plea he would have
asked for more information about Mr. Fail's background,
possibly blocking transaction.
   Mr. Metzenbaum has also charged that the government gave
Mr. Fail a sweetheart deal, in which Mr. Fail put up only
$1,000 of his own money and the government pledged $1.8
billion in assistance. Mr. Fail said those assertions were
"ridiculous" because he committed to invest $120 million in
the thrift and has pledged "all of my business holdings" as
collateral for loans to raise part of the $120 million.
   In addition, Mr. Fail said "substantially all" of the $1.8
billion "will go to the depositors and creditors of the 15
failed thrifts, paying for mistakes made long before" he
bought them. Mr. Fail merged the thrifts and now runs them as
Bluebonnet Savings Bank, based in Dallas.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Fail was pressed assiduously by two
Republican senators, Orrin Hatch of Utah and Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, about the disclosure of his legal problems in
Alabama. "I admit these forms are at best incomplete," Mr.
Fail said in reference to the documents in which he neglected
to mention his company's guilty plea. But Mr. Fail maintained
that the guilty plea was disclosed in other documents and in
conversation with regulators. Concealing the plea, he
protested, would have been like "trying to slip an elephant
into a girls' dormitory."
   But Sen. Specter, summing up his questioning of Mr. Fail,
concluded that "there was not an adequate disclosure."
   Though Mr. Fail testified for nearly three hours, the
hearing left many questions dangling about the sale of the
thrifts. For instance, Mr. Thompson, the lobbyist, said that
as part of his compensation for making calls to regulators
and helping Mr. Fail make his bid, Mr. Fail agreed to pay him
2% of any proceeds Mr. Fail made from the thrifts.
   But Mr. Fail said that no such agreement existed. He said
he had asked regulators whether that kind of agreement was
allowed and "they said emphatically no." The subcommittee
didn't question Mr. Thompson after he made a prepared
statement because it plans to call him back in September
after sifting through documents Mr. Thompson provided
yesterday.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Chiat Offshoot in San Francisco
   Faces Formidable Tasks Ahead

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Along fashionable Maiden Lane here, just
steps from Union Square, an awning hailing "Chiat/Day/Mojo"
still hangs alongside others for trendy boutiques like Chanel
and Laura Ashley.
   In advertising circles, everybody knows Jay Chiat, the
famed ad man whose Venice, Calif.-based ad shop turned out
the pink bunny campaign for Energizer batteries and the wacky
U.B.U. campaign for Reebok.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But does anybody know Fred Goldberg?
   Mr. Goldberg headed Chiat's office here, and two months
ago led a group of senior employees that bought the office
from Chiat. The newly independent ad agency's name, which
will replace the Chiat name on the awning tomorrow, though,
has a decidedly less-sexy ring: Goldberg Moser O'Neill.
   Cut free from the Chiat/Day name, Goldberg Moser now faces
the formidable task of building its own reputation and client
list, a lone agency struggling for attention just like
hundreds of other small to mid-sized agencies. Without the
golden Chiat connection, that task will no doubt be harder.
   To be sure, the Chiat name itself has been badly tarnished
recently. Following client losses, primarily at its New York
office, the agency last week laid off about 40 staffers and
imposed pay cuts on senior managers. Yet even hobbled, the
Chiat name still has more panache than an unknown moniker
like Goldberg Moser. It's still regarded as one of the
country's top creative shops.
   Minus that cachet, Goldberg Moser faces an uncertain
future, particularly when it comes to landing new accounts.
   Mr. Goldberg and his co-creative directors, Mike Moser and
Brian O'Neill, profess not to be worried. In fact, in a
recent interview at their offices, the executives appeared
relieved to be rid of the Chiat bureaucracy and said they are
eager to start anew.
   "Nobody {in Chiat's upper management} liked the San
Francisco market or the office, and yet we did great work and
we made money," Mr. Goldberg contends -- noting that the
office did a big chunk of Chiat's most revered work,
including the early ads for Apple Computer and the recent
"bungee jumping" spot for Reebok. "That was a frustration to
my people and my morale."
   Chiat says it agreed to sell the office to Mr. Goldberg in
large part because of a conflict in new-business strategies:
While Chiat has made no secret of its hunt for $50
million-plus international clients, the San Francisco office
has continued its search for smaller, regional clients. The
result, Mr. Goldberg says, is "many lost opportunities" in
which he had been told not to chase certain clients because
they might conflict with potential deeper-pocket clients for
the New York or Los Angeles offices.
   "I'm in areas that I was never allowed to go in before,"
Mr. Goldberg says. "I've got 10 new business things cooking
right now and I think I'm going to hit a few."
   Mr. Goldberg says the parent company's bottom-line
troubles weren't a factor in his decision to cut loose from
Chiat. "I wish I could say I was that bright," he says.
   Still, Chiat's problems and client losses have indirectly
affected Goldberg Moser. The shop's billings have already
fallen to about $90 million from more than $125 million
because of account losses; it had serviced part of the $40
million Reebok account, which fired Chiat, and had to give up
clients affiliated with Chiat's Australian Mojo agency,
including Koala Springs and the Australian Tourist
Commission. About 15 of just over 100 staffers have left on
their own or been laid off since the ownership switch,
including several who walked out because they didn't want to
be associated with a non-Chiat shop.
   And billings will fall further with the loss of the G.
Heileman Brewing account, including its Rainier and Lone Star
brands. The brewer earlier this year invited its many
agencies to pitch for its combined beer business. Chiat,
before clinching the deal to sell the San Francisco office,
decided not to participate. After its management buy-out,
Goldberg Moser scrambled to get back in the running. But it
was four weeks behind and walked away a loser.
   "We were really at a disadvantage," Mr. Goldberg says. "We
don't have offices all over the place." Heileman picked Della
Femina McNamee to service its account.
   Other accounts look brighter. Longtime client Esprit de
Corp., for which Goldberg Moser previously did just media
buying and planning, has asked the shop to work on a creative
project. Qantas's North American business, which Chiat said
it planned to move to Venice, will stay at Goldberg Moser.
And the shop has picked up one new client under its new name:
the $5 million Wings learning system account from Intelligy
Corp.
   The three partners think they have the talent and an
impressive reel of commercials that will help them bring in
more of their own business. "We still revere a lot of the
principles we adhered to at Chiat/Day," says Mr. O'Neill.
"But we are very conscious that we have a separate identity."
   Mr. O'Neill, who just returned to the office after a stint
at a Chicago agency, and Mr. Moser are now busy working up
ideas on how to sell that identity. A mailing went out to new
clients explaining the changes. Other efforts are in the
works to get the new name out in front of potential clients.
   "Every great agency has mentors, and we had ours," says
Mr. Moser, who is uncharacteristically clean-cut for a
creative executive, referring to Mr. Chiat and Lee Clow, the
funky, sandals-clad top creative executive in Venice. "But we
have our own personality. We're a true San Francisco agency
-- and it's just us."
