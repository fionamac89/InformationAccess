   Ames Department Stores Inc. reported a $429.1 million loss
for its fiscal first quarter, larger than some expectations
and a possible signal of further store closings and layoffs.
   The loss, equal to $11.56 a share, pushed Ames's book
value down to a negative $74.5 million. Book value, or total
assets minus liabilities, is a measure of a company's net
worth.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A year ago, Ames reported a first quarter net loss of
$16.5 million, or 52 cents a share. Its book value then was a
positive $570 million.
   Sales in the quarter, ended April 28, fell to $934.8
million from $1.09 billion.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Ames closed
at $2.125, down 12.5 cents, on volume of 498,200 shares.
   The troubled discount retailer, operating under Chapter 11
bankruptcy court protection, took charges of $347.5 million
in the latest quarter, mostly related to previously announced
store closings and anticipated future markdowns of inventory.
Earlier this month, Ames said it planned to cut 18,000 of its
50,000 employees and close 221 stores, leaving 458 open.
   Ames, based in Rocky Hill, Conn., said the stores that
will stay open operated at about break-even in the first
quarter, on a pretax basis not including special charges,
interest or corporate overhead.
   Company officials said the surviving stores' performance
will be aided in the months ahead by clearance sales and
better-stocked shelves, resulting from financing secured
after the bankruptcy filing. But some creditors and analysts
expect more store closings after the summer.
   "The store closings and write-down of inventory represent
an important first step toward our objective of emerging from
Chapter 11," Steven L. Pistner, Ames's chief executive
officer, said in a prepared statement.
   Thomas Goldberg, an attorney for Ames's creditors, said "I
think it's pretty clear there will have to be a second round"
of closings. Ames has a number of stores "that are on
probation" because they are unprofitable now but may be
redeemable through the boosted sales Ames is aiming for, Mr.
Goldberg added. By September, he said, creditors would want
to look at store-by-store results to separate profitable
stores form unprofitable ones.
   "They may require further downsizing," said Edward Comeau,
an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York, who said the
size of the quarterly loss surprised him. "They're taking the
right steps," Mr. Comeau added, but "it's still going to be a
long way out."
   Doug Ewing, an Ames spokesman, acknowledged that some of
the remaining 458 Ames stores "aren't making a contribution
to profit," but said they represented a small number.
"Management clearly has the motivation and responsibility to
monitor our stores and their performance and will be doing
that," Mr. Ewing added.

   CHICAGO -- A federal grand jury indicted Michael S.
Douglas of Antioch, Ill., for allegedly selling unregistered
securities and defrauding more than 300 investors of millions
of dollars.
   Mr. Douglas, 37 years old, who the indictment says failed
to disclose to investors that he has twice been convicted in
Illinois for theft and deceptive practices, collected about
$45 million from investors between 1987 and late 1989 by
selling securities and other market instruments through three
trading companies he controlled.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The limited partnership interests he offered to investors
constituted securities under federal law, the indictment
says, and thus should have been registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Mr. Douglas is charged with misrepresenting to investors
in at least eight states the actual investment strategy of
the limited partnerships he offered through his company, D&amp;S
Trading Group Ltd.
   Mr. Douglas also told investors D&amp;S had historical returns
of between 10% and 25% on a monthly basis, but those returns
were "invented," according to the indictment. Mr. Douglas
also calculated his share of the purported profit and a
management fee on the basis of profit that was "frequently
nonexistent or grossly inflated," the grand jury said.
   When the SEC began investigating D&amp;S Trading, Mr. Douglas
established a second company, Analytic Trading Systems Inc.,
to prevent discovery of the scheme, according to the
indictment. He subsequently established a third company,
Analytic Trading Service Inc., for the same reason, the
indictment says.
   Federal prosecutors said they haven't determined how much
of the investors' money had been pocketed and how much
remains available. Mr. Douglas's companies are currently
being liquidated.
   Mr. Douglas, who is being held pending a hearing scheduled
for tomorrow, didn't enter a plea yesterday.

   What's an investor to do?
   With the markets continuing to waffle between complacency
and fear, these are tough times for people with money to
invest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Even the experts can't seem to agree about the outlook for
the economy, interest rates or corporate profits. Meanwhile,
political changes race ahead world-wide at a mind-numbing
pace.
   Some investment professionals recommend that individuals
use 10-year Treasury notes as the yardstick for comparing the
allure of various investment alternatives. At the moment,
while the pros don't rule out some selective stock picking,
they say that the risk-return trade-offs seem tipped in favor
of Treasurys.
   "I always start by asking myself why I do or don't want
(the 10-year Treasury) vs. something else," says Arthur
Zeikel, president of Merrill Lynch Asset Management Inc.
"It's the highest-quality investment, it's just 10 years, and
you know exactly what you're going to get if you hold it to
maturity."
   Bonds look increasingly attractive at current interest
rates the higher stocks go, the pros say. "If you compare
value, we're really at a place where stocks are pretty
overextended relative to bonds," says William Gross, managing
director at Pacific Investment Management Co.
   Risk-free 10-year Treasury notes currently yield about
8.4%, and the income is exempt from state and local taxes. By
comparison, the historical return on stocks has averaged
about 10% a year, but with far greater risk: Returns over
shorter periods, particularly less than 10 years, have varied
widely from the long-term average.
   To be sure, investors can still find yields above 8% on
some money-market mutual funds. With so little difference
between yields on these and other short-term investments and
those on longer-term investments, many people apparently see
little or no advantage in "going long."
   But such a flat "yield curve" has in the past been "a sign
you should extend maturities to take advantage of price
returns in the future," says Mr. Gross.
   James Hocking, U.S. chief investment officer at Citibank's
private banking group, estimates that if interest rates
decline, as some people expect, 10-year Treasury notes could
generate total returns -- including both interest payments
and capital appreciation -- of 12% to 15%. "It's an unusual
opportunity investors shouldn't miss," he says.
   As for stocks, most pros agree that the market -- at least
as measured by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index or the Dow
Jones Industrials -- looks pricey based on earnings, interest
rates and other valuation criteria. They say that stocks, as
a group, are likely to disappoint investors, either with
lackluster performance or outright losses in the near term.
   "If you exclude 1987 before the crash, the market is now
selling at a higher valuation than it has at any time since
1972," says Carmine Grigoli, chief equity portfolio
strategist at First Boston Corp. "If you've been conservative
for the last two years about putting money in stocks, this is
not a time to change."
   That doesn't mean there aren't some good long-term values
still to be found in sectors of the market that haven't run
up so wildly in price. But it does mean that this is no time
to chase a rally. "We're looking for a pretty sloppy market
where selectivity is crucial," says Michael Carty, a senior
portfolio manager at Value Line Asset Management Inc.
   For individuals willing to take the extra risk in stocks,
investment professionals offer widely varying suggestions.
   Perhaps the most popular recommendation is to play the
other side of the 1980s borrowing binge -- for instance, by
buying low-debt companies that have strong positions in
industries that are otherwise loaded down with debt.
   Such companies "are in a good position to both increase
market share and raise (profit) margins" as rivals weaken and
fall by the wayside, says Robert Raiff, managing director at
C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. Some of these stocks
still sell at price-earnings multiples that look cheap
relative to their potential growth, he says. These include
American Airlines and Delta in the airline industry, and May
Department Stores and Liz Claiborne among retailers.
   For similar reasons, Eldon Mayer, chairman of Lynch &amp;
Mayer Inc., says large growth stocks could surprise skeptics
long-term, even though many pros view these stocks as
overpriced, after 18 months of strong performance. His
argument: Many of these companies' growth rates "are going to
increase rather than decelerate, because they are now
competing with companies that are overleveraged or have other
serious problems." He continues to like Wal-Mart Stores, Walt
Disney Co., Toys `R' Us and Microsoft, but would stay away
from McDonald's.
   Other strategists say to forget large stocks and go for
small and medium-sized growth stocks, which have been out of
favor with investors for so long that they look extremely
cheap.
   "On the stock side, value is really in the riskier area of
small growth," says Franklin Kennedy, senior vice president
at Equitable Capital Management Corp. As an overall strategy,
he recommends: "Be conservative in asset mix (by holding
bonds and cash) but very aggressive in the stock selection"
by investing in smaller technology and health-care issues.
   Still, other pros doubt that small growth stocks will
return to the limelight any time soon. "Smaller stocks appear
on balance to be cheaper, but really aren't," says First
Boston's Mr. Grigoli.
   Aside from worries about the illiquidity of such stocks,
he says, "my personal philosophy is to avoid them because
it's the really exciting opportunities overseas that will
fuel future earnings growth" among U.S. corporations, and
small stocks generally have little international exposure.
His advice is to stick with multinational companies in
industries such as drugs, health-care, foods, tobacco,
electrical equipment and computer systems.
   Robert Moseson, president of pension consultants
Performance Analytics Inc., says the fact that growth-stock
investing has become so broadly fashionable is a sure sign
that "there's a lot of greed out there now," and the market
is topping out.
   "The individual who owns growth stocks or mutual funds
should take profits and shift to value" -- such as low
price-earnings stocks or value-oriented funds, Mr. Moseson
says. By September, however, he advises being "as far away
from the equity market as possible" because the potential
returns will no longer justify the risk.

   CINCINNATI -- Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. said that costs
related to asbestos claims are expected to total about $110
million this year and that it's concerned about a sudden
upturn in the number of such claims being filed.
   The industrial company also reported that in its second
quarter ended May 31 net rose 74% to $22.6 million, or $2.11
a share, from $13 million, or $1.22 a share, a year earlier.
The latest quarter included a gain of $11.9 million, or $1.11
a share, from the sale of a division.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales slid about 5% to $184.4 million from $193.1 million.
   But despite improvements in operations, especially those
businesses serving the automotive industry, the company said
its asbestos litigation costs remains a "serious problem."
   Until the second quarter, the number of new claims had
been decreasing, a trend that the company had expected to
continue. But in the quarter, about 6,200 new claims were
received compared with 4,000 a year earlier and 4,900 in the
1987 quarter, the company said.
   In the quarter, the company said it disposed of 3,600
claims, compared with 3,400 a year earlier and 1,500 in the
1988 second quarter. Total costs related to those settlements
were about $31 million for the quarter and $62 million for
the six months.
   To fund litigation costs, the company has said it intends
to sell off additional assets, including its trim division
and injection-molding division, which make rubber molded
parts and trim for the automotive industry. "In order to
avoid a severe liquidity problem, the company must complete
the sale of these assets on a timely basis," the company
said.
   The company is a defendant in about 62,100 claims stemming
from its manufacture, from 1934 until 1971, of an
asbestos-containing insulating cement used principally in
shipbuilding and refinery construction.

   Chicago Merc Kills
   Proposal Involving
   Electing Governors

   CHICAGO -- Chicago Mercantile Exchange members, in a show
of support for exchange leadership, defeated a proposal that
would have required any member receiving more than $50,000 a
year from the exchange to be an elected governor of the Merc.
   The proposal was viewed by many Merc members as a
referendum on the rule of Leo Melamed, the undisputed leader
of the futures exchange for more than two decades. For
several years Mr. Melamed has served as chairman of the
Merc's executive committee and as special counsel to the
board. He was appointed to those positions by the Merc's
governors, many of whom owe their seats on the board to Mr.
Melamed's support. His annual salary is $500,000.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   About 59%, or 923, of the Merc members voting opposed the
proposal, while 41%, or 644, favored it, the exchange said. A
majority voting in favor of the proposal, which resulted from
a membership petition, was required for its adoption.
Weighting the votes in favor of full Merc memberships as
opposed to memberships in the exchange's different divisions
made the vote against the proposal even more lop-sided.
   Mr. Melamed, who has said he is resigning from his Merc
positions at year end, and other Merc officers campaigned
against the proposal by phoning Merc clearing member firms
and buttonholing traders on and off the exchange floor. In a
letter sent to members, the board lambasted the proposal,
stating, "board members have the duty and authority to
establish policy and govern exchange affairs, including the
right to determine appropriate compensation."
   Backers of the proposal countered in their own mailing
that "members in positions of designing exchange policy must
be answerable and accountable for their actions."
   Mr. Melamed is widely credited, even by traders who think
he should be directly accountable to the membership via
election to the board, with propelling the Merc from the
status of a sleepy agricultural futures market to a world
leader in financial futures trading.

   Canada's `Peculiar' Province
   Is in Position to Defeat
   The Accord on Quebec

   TOPSAIL, Newfoundland -- Kevin Dunn has come to this
church basement, on a hillside overlooking the blue and
choppy Atlantic, to ask his representative in the
Newfoundland legislature to vote against the Canadian
constitutional accord that would recognize French-speaking
Quebec as a "distinct society."
   Mr. Dunn and his 570,000 fellow Newfoundlanders are
distinct, too. "We're different," says the red-headed,
middle-aged Mr. Dunn. "Call us strange if you want, but we're
unique. We're 500 years old, and this time we're going to be
heard."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Canada's future may hinge on their voice. If either
Newfoundland or Manitoba fails to ratify the Meech Lake
package of constitutional amendments by Saturday, the accord
will die -- and Quebec's movement toward total independence
from Canada will surge.
   Worried about making the emotional debate even hotter,
outsiders aren't rushing to Newfoundland to twist arms.
They're leaving the decision to the 52 members of
Newfoundland's legislature who begin a three-day debate on
the deal this morning.
   The power to influence history is a new sensation for
Newfoundland. Accounting for just 2.2% of Canada's
population, it is the poorest of the nation's provinces,
economically dependent on the Grand Banks fishery, and the
butt of countless "Newfie" jokes.
   As recently as the Great Depression of the 1930s
Newfoundland was governed as a British colony, and it joined
Canada only in 1949. It is nearer to Ireland than it is to
Miami or the Canadian prairies. There's a small,
French-speaking minority of 3,000 in the province. Most
Newfoundlanders live in modest clapboard homes along the
coves and bays of the island's bleak, forbidding and starkly
beautiful coast.
   The Dictionary of Newfoundland English includes 600 pages
of local words and expressions. In Newfoundland, Mother
Nature "slobs" a harbor with soft, mushy ice. A worthless
fellow too lazy to fish is an "angishore." Outsiders --
people who "come from away" -- find some Newfoundlanders'
thick accent incomprehensible.
   "Given our history and the fact that we live on an island
it isn't surprising that we're peculiar," says Cyril Poole,
editorin-chief of the Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and
Labrador. Labrador, largely uninhabited, is the mainland part
of the province, officially known as Newfoundland and
Labrador.
   If Newfoundland is peculiar, it is also peaceful. Police
don't carry guns here. Among other distinctions: There are no
public schools; the government largely finances four
religious school systems, one Catholic and three Protestant.
   Newfoundland politicians, who as a rule love the sound of
their own voices, regularly embrace goofy development
schemes. The latest failed project was going to make the
cloud-shrouded island a world-class producer of cucumbers by
growing them hydroponically in giant greenhouses.
   Mr. Poole delights in his province's place names: Witless
Bay, Blow Me Down, and Happy Adventure, as examples. Heart's
Content, Heart's Desire and Heart's Delight are all within a
few miles of each other. Mr. Poole's favorites are Nancy Oh,
Come By Chance, and Nicky's Nose.
   Newfoundland was discovered in 1497 by John Cabot. By the
1600s settlements were established to exploit the fishery,
which still employs almost a quarter of the labor force. "The
fishery just permeates the whole culture," Mr. Poole says.
   Every Newfoundlander knows classic songs such as
"Squid-Jiggin' Ground" even though squid is rarely jigged, or
caught by handline, these days. Eating cod is almost a duty
here. One traditional dish, fish and brewis, consists of
dried, salted cod and "hard bread" soaked overnight, then
cooked and served with scrunchions, small cubes of pork fat.
"Hard bread" is very, very hard. "Don't bite (an unsoaked)
one unless you have a great dental plan," advises Gerard
Power, a staffer at Purity Factories Ltd., which makes the
stuff.
   Times are hard in the fishery. Newfoundlanders blame the
Canadian government for the death of their sealing industry a
few years ago at the hands of foreign animal lovers. Now
Newfoundlanders say Ottawa is letting foreigners overfish and
slowly kill the cod fishery, the only source of jobs in many
of the province's tiny outports.
   Unemployment is so high that people talk about two kinds
of jobs here: permanent and "10-42." After ten weeks of
steady employment a worker qualifies for 42 weeks on the
dole. The jobless rate in May was 17.6%, compared with 7.6%
in Canada as a whole. Average household income in 1988 was
34,233 Canadian dollars, compared with $40,684 for the
country as a whole.
   The economic troubles feed antagonism toward Quebec.
Newfoundland has huge hydroelectric resources in Labrador,
but the province blundered in making a contract to sell the
power to Quebec at a price that is now only one-fifteenth the
prevailing rate. The contract runs until 2041. It is "kind of
a running sore," says Newfoundland writer Patrick O'Flaherty,
adding that a "strong latent anti-Quebec feeling" partly
motivates the opposition to the constitutional accord.
   It doesn't help that Quebec's separatist opposition party,
the Parti Quebecois, doesn't recognize Newfoundland's hold on
Labrador. And many Newfoundlanders, like other
English-speaking Canadians, believe that recognizing Quebec
as a "distinct society" will give it special power that other
provinces lack.
   Mr. O'Flaherty is one of several well-known
Newfoundlanders urging the legislature to ratify the accord.
He fears that Canada will break up if the accord dies. "It's
a choice between a flawed accord and possibly the future of
the country," Mr. O'Flaherty says. If Quebec were to
separate, Newfoundland would be even more isolated from the
rest of Canada, he says.
   Now Newfoundland's politicians are canvassing every town
and hamlet to sound the depth of feeling on the issue. Here
in Topsail, visitors in a steady stream stop by the church to
tell Patricia Cowan what they think. Ms. Cowan, the
province's minister of employment, represents the Topsail
district in the legislature, the House of Assembly.
   "No, no, a thousand times no]" a constituent says before
launching into an impassioned speech. The pastor of the
Anglican church also urges Ms. Cowan to reject the accord.
"I'm a Newfoundlander by birth, a Canadian by heart and a
Meech Lake opponent by nature," says the pastor, the Rev.
Lloyd Collett. In four hours 65 constituents drop in. Only
four support the accord.
   If the legislators vote according to the wishes of their
constituents the accord will fail. "It will be interesting to
see what happens," says Ms. Cowan.
   The Newfoundlanders' new-found political clout seems
destined for a short life. There's even a chance the vote
here will be canceled as meaningless, if the Meech Lake
accord dies first in the Manitoba legislature.
   Newfoundland visionaries can still nurture their dream of
independent nationhood for The Rock, as the province is
known. It had been a self-governing Commonwealth nation until
Britain took charge in 1934. Now, says singer Shawn McCann,
pointing to the unofficial green, white and pink flag of the
Republic of Newfoundland, "That's all we have left."
   If for nothing else, Newfoundlanders resent other
Canadians for their Newfie jokes, even though Newfoundlanders
are fond of telling them on themselves.
   "Two hunters go into the woods and shoot a moose," Ralph
Wiseman, Ms. Cowan's aide, relates. "They begin dragging it
back home by the tail. The tail breaks off. `What are we
going to do now?' one says to the other. A third hunter comes
along. `Why don't you just pull it by the head,' he says. `We
aren't going that way,' the first two reply."
   Says Ms. Cowan: "People here wouldn't like you tell that
story unless they were sure you were a friend."

   AKRON, Ohio -- Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., citing
sluggishness in the U.S. auto industry and other factors,
said it expects to post a second-quarter loss of as much as
$10 million after a pretax restructuring charge of $35
million.
   About 1,100 employees involved in tire sales and marketing
in the U.S. will lose their jobs as part of the
restructuring, the company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the 1989 second quarter, Goodyear earned $27.1 million,
or 47 cents a share, on sales of $2.8 billion. Results
included an after-tax charge of $95 million related to the
sale of unused pipe.
   Also, the tire maker said it expects 1990 second-half
results to about match its disappointing 1989 second half, in
which it earned $85.2 million, or $1.57 a share, on sales of
$5.42 billion.
   On the news, tire industry analyst Harry Millis, of
McDonald &amp; Co., Cleveland, reduced his full-year earnings
estimate to about $2 a share, excluding any charges, down
from $2.55 a share. Mr. Millis said job cutbacks were about
double what he had expected.
   In 1989 Goodyear earned $206.8 million, or $3.58 a share,
on sales of $10.87 billion. Results included a gain of $17.4
million from a tax-loss carry-forward offset by a charge of
$105.9 million, primarily from the sale of the company's
South African subsidiary.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Goodyear closed yesterday at $33.75, off 25 cents.
   Goodyear, which has about 50,000 employees in the U.S.,
said it's eliminating its five tire sales field offices in an
effort to make sales and marketing more efficient and
responsive to customers. In April, the company created two
new units: one for consumer tires that serves mostly the
passenger tire market and the other for commercial tires.
Each group has 28 sales regions and 43 sales districts.
   McDonald's Mr. Millis said there haven't been any pleasant
surprises for Goodyear this year except that sales volume of
replacement tires has increased. However, he said, pricing on
replacement tires has been weak. Although he said pricing on
tires shipped to domestic auto makers has been fairly good,
volume has been off. He also said Goodyear has been hurt by a
pricing war on tires shipped to European auto makers as well.
   Goodyear has other nagging problems. A prolonged strike at
its tire plant in Turkey is costing the company about five
cents a share each month in lost earnings, Mr. Millis said.
The company also continues to be hurt by the carrying costs
of its west-to-east crude oil pipeline and startup costs at a
tire plant in Canada.

   Ski-to-Sea Relay Race

   Bellingham, Wash. -- Smelling nerves, the KVOS-TV crew
fell upon me like vultures. "How did you train for this
race?" the cameraman asks, his lens eyeing me. Be clever, I
tell myself. Make the news. "Train?" I say. "I just signed up
for this four days ago. There really wasn't much I could do."
No good. The camera stares blankly. "I drank beer and ate
spaghetti last night -- that's how I trained," I add
brightly. Better. The cameraman and his producer smile.
   As they walked away I wished I HAD trained a bit more. I
was fewer than five minutes from the starting gun for the
1990 Ski to Sea relay race, a bit of spring madness in which
close to 200 teams scramble from the Mount Baker Ski Area --
where I was standing -- to Fairhaven Bay at Bellingham, 85
miles away.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I had the first leg -- a four-mile cross-country skiing
loop -- and I knew I was in big trouble. I'd largely
abandoned the skinny skis this winter to devote my energy to
a new-found passion for alpine skiing. I'd warmed up for the
race early in the morning by performing two ungainly
face-plants in the snow as people in Lycra ski suits skated
gracefully by. One woman had even taken an hour or so to
apply color-coordinated makeup and lipstick and arrange her
hair in an artful bun. We had crawled out of bed groaning at
5 a.m. and scarcely had brushed our teeth. My team was called
the Roaring Forties, a nod toward the ages of the team
members. But last-minute logistical problems had forced team
captain Steve Fancher to make some hasty additions --
including me. And because I'm 35 I would take the Forties out
of the master's division and into the more competitive open
division.
   But the Forties weren't going to set their hearts on
competing seriously with the hard-core athletic fanatics who
usually win here. Instead we were conducting an informal
rivalry with the Higher Plane Woodworks team. We'd spent the
night before the race at Woodworks team member Chet Lackey's
house overlooking Whatcom Lake, guzzling Budweiser and the
aforementioned spaghetti. The old school pals that make up
most of the Forties and Higher Plane teams use the race as an
excuse for an annual get-together. Steve provided the
evening's highlight by executing a neat handspring and back
flip on the lawn while we cheered from the deck and Dire
Straits blared on the stereo.
   And now the official is counting down: "Five . . . four .
. . three . . . two . . ." We're off. I scramble ahead,
trying to stay a little behind and to one side of the pack as
it duck-walks from the start. My strategy is to hang back
until the pack untangles, then try to use my conditioning as
a runner to gain ground on the hills. But the lanes narrow
after a short but steep hill near the start, and by the time
I reach the top I am stuck behind a long line of skiers. So
much for tactics.
   It's a warm morning, and the snow is soft. Like most
people, I find myself doing less skiing than alternately
hopping and jogging on skis. I discover I have forgotten how
to turn with the light cross-country equipment, and collapse
sideways into the snow at the end of the first downhill run.
A half dozen other skiers swerve desperately to miss me and
go down themselves. They glare at me. I thrash about, trying
to regain my footing. Then I'm off again, sweat pouring into
my eyes and skis slipping on the snow.
   The best skiers reach the exchange point in 20 minutes. I
take 40, and am happy to hand off the plastic medallion.
Steve, on downhill skis, heads down the slope. He then faces
a grueling slog up hundreds of feet of steep snow, heavy skis
in hand, before skiing back down to the lodge for the
exchange with Rufino Contreras, our runner.
   The modern Ski to Sea race dates back to 1973, but it
traces its roots to early in the century. Back then,
Bellingham was the starting point for the Mount Baker
Marathon, which extended all the way to the summit of
10,778-foot Mount Baker and back. There were no particular
rules, and competitors used any means possible to gain an
edge. Logger Joe Galbraith set a course record of 12 hours
and 28 minutes in part by using a chauffeur-driven Ford to
reach the base of the mountain. His competitor tried a train
and might have won if a cow hadn't wandered into his path and
derailed his ride. Still, I've climbed Mount Baker three
times and taken from five to eight hours just to reach the
summit from a camp of 6,000 feet or higher. Galbraith's feat
was remarkable, and not to be duplicated. After three years,
in 1913, the race was suspended after a competitor fell into
a crevasse on Mount Baker and was nearly killed.
   The current race is considerably less life-threatening,
although no pushover. This year's event included two ski
legs, a kidney-pounding nine-mile run that descended 1,700
feet down steep switchbacks, a hilly 36-mile bike leg, a long
canoe or kayak paddle down the Nooksack River, and finally an
eight-mile sail across Fairhaven Bay in agile little
two-person catamarans called Hobie Cats.
   Nature conspires to give the normally sedentary sailors a
workout. The lowest tide in decades leaves the Cats beached
on a mud flat more than a mile from where the canoeists hit
their exchange point. The sailors sprint from the exchange in
a great show of bravado, but then slow to a jog. Our team
puts in a valiant effort but never recovers from the hole I
dug for us.
   Steve, Rufino and I finally get to wave to our teammates
aboard their Hobie Cat as they pilot the boat into the beach
at race's end at 6:10 p.m. Nine hours, 38 minutes. Slow, but
far from last. The winning team, Win's Drive-Inn from
Seattle, finished the course in six hours, 38 minutes, moving
from third to first place with a brilliant sailing leg. Our
chief rivals -- the Higher Plane group -- finished a
respectable 49th, with a time of eight hours, 33 minutes.
They already were well into the night's supply of Budweiser
at Chet's house when we straggled in. But it was our team
that gained media fame. "Did you talk to a television crew?"
asked the wife of a member of the Higher Plane team
excitedly. "You told them you had beer and spaghetti. We saw
you on KVOS."

   PS New Mexico
   Gets New Officers;
   Little Change Seen

<LP>
   Public Service Co. of New Mexico named new top officers,
but the two have long histories with the troubled utility,
and critics contend they will bring very little change.
   "They are not new blood," said Ellen O'Brien, a legal
assistant for the city of Albuquerque, referring to John
Ackerman, a former division head who was named president and
chief executive officer, and Ashton B. Collins Jr., a
longtime director who was named chairman. "They are just
changing seats," Ms. O'Brien said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Ackerman, an electrical engineer by training, has
worked for the utility for 19 years, most recently as
president and chief operating officer of its Gas Co. of New
Mexico unit. The 48-year-old automotive hobbyist, who
couldn't be reached to comment, was also named to the
company's board.
   Mr. Collins, 58, is president of Reddy Communications, a
closely held firm in Albuquerque that provides research
services to electric utilities, including PS New Mexico. He
has been one of the utility's directors since 1979.
   The two succeed Jerry D. Geist, 56-year-old executive who
retired as chairman, president and chief executive, effective
with yesterday's board meeting. Mr. Geist, closely associated
with the ambitious expansion plans that led to many of PS New
Mexico's recent woes, said in a statement, "My departure will
facilitate and encourage the resolution of current problems."
Mr. Geist was in meetings and couldn't be reached.
   Chief among those problems is a passel of disgruntled
customers, including Albuquerque, PS New Mexico's home town.
The city and other rate payers have berated the utility for
15 years about rates they say skyrocketed when the utility
embarked on efforts to diversify beyond regulated businesses
and to increase its generating capacity in order to sell
energy throughout the Southwest. When the Sun Belt boom
fizzled, PS New Mexico was left with a capacity reserve 66%
above its peak demand.
   "Their eyes have been bigger than their stomach," said
Randy Childress, a deputy attorney general for the state of
New Mexico. "In a nutshell, this company has been
overaggressive."
   Many blame Mr. Geist for PS New Mexico's troubles. "Jerry
wasn't going to be satisfied with a small electric utility,"
said Don Hancock of the Southwest Research and Information
Center, a nonprofit group that has intervened in PS New
Mexico rate cases for rate payers. "He wanted to make an
impact" well beyond his service region.
   But the state's public service commission has never made
Mr. Geist the issue. "Jerry Geist has not become a
personality in this as far as we're concerned," said Martin
Blake, a commissioner. "He has always been cooperative and
tried to shoot straight."
   The commission has simply been disinclined to let PS New
Mexico recoup its costs for producing power that isn't
needed, especially its $1.2 billion investment in the Palo
Verde nuclear project. Denied rate increases since 1984 --
and actually hit with rate decreases -- the utility has
reduced its work force by one-fifth, suspended its common
dividend and taken substantial charges to bail out of its
nonutility businesses. The company has even encouraged
takeover talk.
   Some of his harshest detractors say Mr. Geist apparently
left the company he had worked for for 30 years of his own
accord. "That board has never forced Jerry to do anything he
didn't want to do," said Mr. Hancock.
   Mr. Collins, the new chairman, exhorts critics to "stay
tuned. The board and management team are strong individuals
on their own who will forge a good future" for the company.
   He acknowledged that Mr. Geist was chief architect of PS
New Mexico's ill-fated expansion plans. But he also said that
Mr. Geist "is an extraordinary and gifted leader who will be
far more appreciated by the next generation than by this
one." He cited PS New Mexico's 15-year-old pollution-control
program, which many say sets the pace for the industry,
especially given the provisions of the Clean Air Act.

   TORONTO -- Securities regulators from Ontario and Manitoba
agreed to accept a voluntary payment of about 550,000
Canadian dollars (US$468,270) by James Richardson, a former
government minister, in settlement of proceedings brought
against him on allegations of insider trading.
   The settlement agreement didn't attribute any wrongdoing
to Mr. Richardson. The agreement was reached between Mr.
Richardson's legal counsel and staff members of each of the
provincial securities commissions. Both parties said they
wanted to avoid the lengthy proceedings that could result if
formal charges were brought.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Richardson, 68 years old, comes from a prominent
Winnipeg, Manitoba, family that made its name and fortune in
grain trading. Mr. Richardson also served as defense minister
in the Liberal Party governments of Pierre Trudeau in the
1970s.
   The insider-trading allegations arose from Mr.
Richardson's short-selling of shares of Kingston,
Ontario-based Plastic Engine Technology Corp., which
subsequently went into receivership in April 1989. Regulatory
officials alleged that Mr. Richardson initiated the short
sales after a discussion with a Plastic Engine director about
the company's financial position and the possibility it would
file for bankruptcy-law proceedings. A short sale is the sale
of borrowed stock by an investor who hopes to make a profit
by buying an equal number of shares later at a lower price to
replace the borrowed stock.
   As part of the settlement, Mr. Richardson is prohibited
from dealing in securities in Ontario and Manitoba for three
years. He also agreed to pay C$300,000 into a fund that will
be used to compensate people who incurred losses as a result
of the short sales. Mr. Richardson's gross proceeds from the
short sales amounted to C$298,515.
   Mr. Richardson also agreed to pay C$100,000 each to the
treasuries of the two provinces and as much as C$50,000 to
cover costs of the provinces' investigation in the case.

   PHILADELPHIA -- Bell Atlantic Corp. said it signed an
agreement to acquire Simborg Systems Corp. in an all-stock
transaction but didn't disclose the terms.
   Closely held Simborg, based in Greenbrae, Calif., develops
hospital information management systems and is a pioneer in
open architecture systems for the health care industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bell Atlantic is a telecommunications company.
   Bell Atlantic said the purchase -- which would involve its
first subsidiary in the hospital information industry -- will
be closed within 60 days and the venture will be renamed Bell
Atlantic Healthcare Systems, providing total patient care
solutions for hospitals and other health care facilities in
the U.S.and Canada.
   Donald W. Simborg, who founded the company in 1984, will
become president of Bell Atlantic Healthcare Systems. All of
Simborg Systems' 40 employees are expected to join the new
company, Bell Atlantic said.
   Simborg System's STAT LAN hospital network product,
currently used in 25 U.S. hospitals, will complement network
and business systems offered by Bell Atlantic units.
   "STAT LAN is a backbone to a network to which a customer
can plug in applications," a Bell Atlantic spokeswoman said.
   "Healthcare is a major thrust for Bell Atlantic," said
Jeffrey S. McDermott, president of Bell Atlantic Software and
Systems Solutions division, which will oversee the
acquisition.
   The STAT LAN health care information network uses the
latest local area network and microcomputer technology,
allowing different hospital departments to run independent
systems and to share information over the network.
   The company said Bell Atlantic Healthcare Systems will
market sales of STAT LAN and will continue joint marketing
accords with distributors such as Andersen Consulting and
Ameritech Corp., both based in Chicago.
   Douglas Ryckman, managing partner of Andersen Consulting,
said hospital systems must evolve to include open
architecture and networking.
   Industry consultant Sheldon Dorenfest said the deep
pockets of Bell Atlantic will give Simborg Systems the
"resources and staying power to further enhance STAT LAN and
become a major player in health care information systems."
   Clayton Brown, an analyst for A.G. Edwards in New York,
said the venture is another way for Bell Atlantic to
diversify. "The deal is different from Bell Atlantic's
cellular phone and yellow pages mainstays," he said.
   Bell Atlantic shares closed yesterday at $49.75, off 25
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   MOSCOW -- The Soviet power structure may still flinch from
adopting a market economy, but large numbers of would-be
Soviet entrepreneurs are ready to become capitalists now. An
American journalist traveling in the Soviet Union sees this
eagerness demonstrated in a number of ways, from the truly
wacky to the impressive.
   In the midst of a sit-down television interview, an
uninvited man quietly pulls up a chair. He places some
photographs and a can of honey on the table. The color photos
depict arctic scenes. It becomes apparent that he is offering
my television station exclusive rights to put its logo on the
back of a man hiking alone to the North Pole. The hiker will
live on honey and ginseng, which the entrepreneur is also
selling. "Americans need to know this is complete food," he
says of the honey.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Minutes later another fellow approaches with an idea to
form a joint venture selling a musical regimen for
convalescing people. The regimen, he says, produces
"therapeutic psychological effects." A husband and wife team
pop up. They want to form a joint venture with Americans to
deliver holistic health care to the U.S. A Ukrainian is
looking for partners to send a group of 20 musicians,
spiritual consultants and witches to North America on a
healing mission.
   While these people are frantically searching for ways to
turn a profit as Soviet society opens up, one man already
has. Artyem Tarasov lords over a burgeoning empire from the
basement of a Moscow tenement (even the successful have
difficulty finding office space in Moscow). By many accounts,
he is the nation's first millionaire entrepreneur. He is
certainly the first to make an issue of his wealth.
   To a government that says it wants a market economy but
does not know how to achieve it, the 39-year-old
chain-smoking Armenian has persistently been saying "make up
your mind."
   Mr. Tarasov's cooperative, Technika, generated his first
fortune, and forced the issue with the power structure.
Technika imported desktop computers, an item still in
critically short supply in the Soviet Union. The firm was
very successful. In January 1989, Mr. Tarasov and his two
partners decided to pay themselves salaries of three million
rubles each (between $200,000 and $1.5 million in the
uncertain realm of dollar-to-ruble exchange rates). Salaries
for members of cooperatives are theoretically unregulated,
but no cooperative had ever admitted making so much money, or
paid its executives so generously. The government's reaction
was swift: It froze Technika's bank accounts and voided some
of its contracts, virtually halting business at the firm.
After the freeze, Mr. Tarasov played the gambit one step
further. He took the government to court. This would have
been a tricky move even in the West. But Mikhail Gorbachev
has been exhorting the Soviet legal system toward
responsibility and Technika took him at his word.
   The company won its lawsuit, gaining the return of its
frozen bank accounts and 50 million rubles in punitive
damages, according to Mr. Tarasov. But his victory remains
incomplete. The government hasn't paid the award yet, and he
forces a wry smile when asked whether it is probable that he
will receive it at all. He still can't pay his employees what
he'd like, either, so he compensates them in perks. His
company owns 32 Mercedes-Benz cars, which may make it the
best-equipped motorpool in the Soviet capital after the West
German embassy. As added compensation, he sends his employees
abroad for business meetings whenever possible.
   Since Mr. Tarasov's fight with the government, the
workforce at Technika has withered from 400 employees down to
20. But he says he and his colleagues have started two new
firms, Vita, which specializes in the import and retail sale
of pharmaceuticals and Micrograf, a British-Soviet joint
venture that will make equipment for microcircuit
manufacturers.
   Mr. Tarasov maintains that private enterprises are in fact
flourishing in the Soviet Union but that they are simply
masked under the label of cooperatives. He is a vice
president of the union of cooperatives in the Soviet Union.
Gross income from cooperatives more than doubled last year,
he claims, to 41 billion rubles at the beginning of this year
from 17 billion rubles at the beginning of 1989. He counts
260,000 cooperatives in the nation, employing 4.5 million
people, still less than 10% of the work force, but growing
rapidly. In spite of the growth, and the unabashed desire of
many Soviets to increase their incomes, there is still a
great deal of opposition to privately run enterprises.
   Communist theory teaches that the fruits of society should
be equally distributed to all. According to that mindset,
anybody who was rich, almost by definition, was a criminal.
"The poorer you were," Mr. Tarasov says, "the more honest you
were."
   Despite hostile public opinion, Mr. Tarasov has met with
Prime Minister Nikolai Rhyzkov to discuss the future of
cooperatives, and he has noticed movement toward capitalism
by some Soviet officials as their futures in the public
sector become less certain. "Many chiefs, many members of our
government, try to make for themselves special places in the
private sector, so if something happens they have these
places," he observes. "That's why they try to open joint
ventures and cooperatives, but deny that they are connected
with them." He cites the example of a Moscow public official
whose position is likely to be dissolved, who helped to set
up the Canadian/Soviet McDonald's restaurant in Red Square.
   His own sights are on bigger targets. Because of a lack of
capital, Soviet private enterprises have historically been
concentrated in the service industries. But Mr. Tarasov's
companies have a $6 million cash hoard in hard currency. So
one of Mr. Tarasov's firms is readying plans for a
construction materials factory in Armenia.
   It is hard to predict where Mr. Tarasov's companies will
be five years from now, and he knows the government could
erase what he's gained at any time. As he cruises the streets
of Moscow in a Mercedes 500 SEL, an Afghan war veteran
travels with him as a bodyguard, ready to fend off the Moscow
underworld and the aggressively jealous alike. Still, to the
Westerner, his future looks bright. Vita will soon open a
hard currency drug store in Moscow, to sell, among other
revolutionary new products, Bayer aspirin.

   PALMDALE, Calif. -- Northrop Corp. executives and Air
Force brass invited reporters inside the B-2 Stealth bomber
factory here for the first time, underscoring how nervous
they are about congressional efforts to kill the plane.
   The balcony viewing of the shop floor, where dozens of
workers were scurrying to complete four of the manta-shaped
aircraft, was preceded by a two-hour briefing, where the
press was implored, in the words of Gen. Richard Scofield,
"to tell the whole story."

   But that plea, essentially to stop focusing on the
Stealth's enormous price tag and instead to acknowledge the
technological advances made on the program, remains a hard
sell to many lawmakers.
   "This plane is going to bankrupt America," Rep. John
Kasich (R., Ohio) said in an interview. Were Northrop to
build all 75 B-2s being sought now by the Pentagon, they
would cost more than $800 million each.
   Rep. Kasich has proposed a measure that would mothball the
tooling for the B-2 after only 16 planes are built. He said
he now has more than 200 supporters for that plan; the bill
needs 218 to pass the House.
   "Sure, it's got me worried," Ollie Boileau, president and
general manager of Northrop's B-2 division, said of the
effort. Gen. William Davitte, special assistant for strategic
modernization, said that other attempts brewing to put the
B-2 on the shelf for a year, while more testing is done, are
nothing more than "a euphemism for killing out the program."
   Yesterday's media circus provided little, if any, new
information about the B-2. Patriotic slogans were easily
tossed about. Tendentious explanations of why the nation
needs a manned, penetrating bomber were provided. But mostly
the gathering was a chance for the project's champions to
rebut criticism of the plane point by point.
   Kent Kresa, Northrop's chief executive, shot down
arguments that the Stealth is easily detected by certain
kinds of radar. He said more than 40 concepts have been
devised to foil Stealth technology but still "we're no closer
to defeating Stealth today than when the original concept was
proposed" more than a decade ago.
   In fact, it was asserted that trying to find the B-2 on a
radar screen would be as tough as trying to pick out someone
you know in the Rose Bowl, when it is filled, with the lights
out, and all you have is a flashlight.
   Gen. Davitte defended the B-2's mission, both strategic
and conventional. He likened the plane to Bo Jackson, the
multisport athlete, maintaining that the Stealth can do many
things well. But all of its roles, he said, have one
underlying goal: nuclear deterrence.
   Northrop officials also reiterated the manufacturing
advances the B-2 has inspired, especially with computer-aided
design. These techniques, they said, slowly are filtering to
other aerospace companies, and into other industries as well.
And they hailed the Stealth's 16 flight tests so far,
totaling more than 67 hours in the air, as a success.
   The one-million-square-foot final assembly area, Building
401, is itself impressive. Huge B-2 parts are hauled in by
C-5 cargo planes from LTV Corp., Boeing Co. and other major
subcontractors. The fuselage and wing sections are then
joined, though there is hardly any riveting needed on the
high-tech composite parts. At its peak, the factory could
handle more than a dozen planes at once.
   But, admittedly for the officials who hope to reach that
number, cost remains a sticking point. Indeed, one of the
more compelling reasons for making all 75 B-2s is a
paradoxical one: lots of money already has been sunk into the
program, including $1.2 billion out of Northrop's own pocket.
   Gen. Scofield, in what is becoming an oft-repeated
argument, said it would cost about $35 billion to shut down
the program early and wind up with an ineffective fleet of 15
B-2s. To get 75 planes, he maintained, the figure only goes
up to about $62 billion.
   The Air Force, which has been criticized for keeping
details about the B-2 classified for too long, apparently
will try to do better on one of its other costly planes, the
Advanced Tactical Fighter. On Friday, Northrop and team
member McDonnell Douglas Corp. will roll out their version of
the jet at Edwards Air Force Base, and top program officials
will be on hand to answer questions.

   WASHINGTON -- Housing starts sank further in May, reaching
their lowest level since the recession month of October 1982,
the Commerce Department reported.
   Builders began work on houses and apartments last month at
an annual rate of 1,207,000 units, down 1.4% from April's
rate of 1,224,000, the department said. Starts fell 6.4% in
April and 12.2% in March. They haven't increased since
January, when they surged 23.2% to a 1,568,000 annual rate,
partly as a result of unseasonally warm weather. The figures
are adjusted for seasonal variations.

   Analysts said the downward trend in housing starts is a
further sign of the sluggish U.S. economy. They cited a
slowdown in job growth, high interest rates and a credit
crunch in some areas, combined with a large inventory of
unsold homes.
   "The inventory situation, which is fairly serious,
combined with the weak economic fundamentals . . . suggests
to builders they ought to hold off on construction in the
market," said David Seiders, chief economist for the National
Association of Home Builders.
   While housing starts were weak across the board, showing
continued declines in both single-family and multifamily
housing, analysts say the apartment market is the
hardest-hit.
   Contributing to the decline in apartment construction,
several economists said, is the lack of detailed regulations
for complying with a new law intended to make housing more
accessible to the handicapped. The Department of Housing and
Urban Development has been late in coming out with the
guidelines, Mr. Seiders said, and this has "put the
multifamily builders in a state of limbo because the
contractors don't know the rules they are operating under."
   Construction of single-family homes in May fell 1%, to an
annual rate of 896,000 units, after a 9.1% drop in April. It
was the lowest number since the 862,000 rate in December
1982.
   Work on apartments and other multifamily dwellings slipped
2.5% to an annual rate of 311,000 after rising 2.6% to an
annual rate of 319,000 in April.
   Regionally, the report said housing starts in the
Northeast and South registered slight increases, to which
economists responded with little optimism.
   "In statistical terms the changes aren't very
significant," said David Berson, chief economist for the
Federal National Mortgage Association. "For the last couple
of months all regions of the country have been depressed
compared to where they were in 1989, and the only part of the
country where that may not be true is the Midwest."
   The number of building permits issued for future
construction declined 4.6% in May to a 1,057,000 annual rate
after dropping 10.1% in April to an annual rate of 1,108,000.

   By the time he saw the oncoming ship, it was too late.
   The pilot of a Panamanian-registered tanker was completing
a complicated turn into the cramped Houston Ship Channel last
summer when he saw heading toward him a tugboat pushing an
oil-filled barge.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The pilot, Michael B. Gale, frantically radioed the
tugboat. "I can't, I can't stop this thing," he said.
   The tugboat operator, Mason T. Ware, responded: "I can't
stop now. Lord of Mercy, Skipper."
   Five seconds later, Mr. Ware cleared his throat and said,
"There ain't nothing I can do, Cap."
   The collision came 2 1/2 minutes later, as the Panamanian
ship, the Rachel B, plunged into the barge, ripping open a
hole through which 240,000 gallons of oil flowed into the
water near the Gulf of Mexico.
   As this and countless other incidents -- such as last
week's fire aboard the tanker Mega Borg -- illustrate, the
nation's system of transporting oil by tanker is a wreck. On
two out of every three days, on average, an oil tanker in
U.S. waters catches fire, explodes, collides with a dock or
another ship, breaks apart, experiences mechanical failure,
runs aground or winds up in some other kind of accident,
Coast Guard accident reports indicate.
   "This is the single most important issue we see right
now," says Admiral J. William Kime, the Coast Guard
commandant.
   Last week's Mega Borg incident could have become the
biggest spill in U.S. history. For four agonizing days last
week, fire roared from the 886-foot Norwegian supertanker.
Crippled, it settled lower and lower, threatening to dump a
staggering 38 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.
   Then, slowly, firefighters won control. In the end, only
3.9 million gallons of crude leaked, and most of that burned
in the holocaust or evaporated in the searing Texas sun. An
environmental disaster had been averted. This time.
   "There are problems at all levels of the oil
transportation system, including the design and construction
of the ships, control of traffic in the harbors, the training
and competence of ship crews and the ability of the
regulators to oversee the whole operation," declares Peter
Johnson, senior associate of the Office of Technology
Assessment in Washington.
   What put the oil transport system on the rocks, experts
say, is a decade of corner-cutting driven by slumping
revenues. As crude-oil prices crashed from $40 a barrel in
1981 to as low as $10 five years later, the industry hacked
spending, reduced tanker crews and began to stretch
equipment. Excess capacity and collapsing revenues also
spurred independent tanker operators, who transport the bulk
of the nation's crude, to delay maintenance and repairs, and
to hire cheaper and fewer sailors.
   Things are likely to get worse, too. Now demand for oil
and tankers to move it is rebounding. Currently, an average
of 52 tankers a day deliver 462 million gallons of crude oil,
gasoline and other petroleum products to U.S. ports, up from
400 million gallons five years ago, the American Petroleum
Institute estimates. Because the U.S. is increasingly
dependent on foreign oil, both numbers are rising steadily.
   But the system is fatigued. Many ships are in poor shape,
crews inadequate and practices sloppy. Industry experts
expect accidents to increase right along with imports, and
possibly faster.
   Many new ships are designed and built with less steel,
which can make them more vulnerable than old ones. And some
government steps intended to prevent problems may have
actually made them worse.
   "The whole industry has changed and these people have to
modernize," insists Sen. Brock Adams, the Washington state
Democrat who is pushing various tanker-related legislation.
"You now have such a massive world-wide movement of oil you
have to treat it as dangerous."
   Industry officials don't wholly disagree. They too worry
about aging ships and human error by poorly qualified crews
and officers. "There is room for considerable improvement,"
concedes Tormod Rafgard, managing director of the
International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, a
trade group in Norway. "But it is exaggerated to say this is
an unsafe system; 99.99% of the oil is coming in without
problems. It is a good system."
   In fact, while definitive statistics on all tanker
troubles aren't available, the number of large spills (10,000
gallons or more) in the U.S. has held at six or seven a year
for a decade, says Richard Golob, publisher of Golob's Oil
Pollution Bulletin. But expectations of safety have risen
mightily, especially since the Exxon Valdez dumped nearly 11
million gallons of crude into cold Prince William Sound 15
months ago.
   "The boundary between acceptable and nonacceptable
accidents has changed," says Terje Staalstrom, a manager for
Oslo-based det Norske Veritas, a ship classification society.
   And during the '80s, the pressure to save money also
intensified. So upkeep of ships, new and old, has suffered.
"The majority of large tankers are out of date, over-age and
in many cases poorly maintained," Paul Slater, chairman of
the ship finance firm First International Financial Corp.,
told a tanker conference in California last week.
   A long period of depressed shipping rates that began in
the mid-1970s encouraged owners to postpone maintenance,
particularly on idled vessels. By 1985, a typical large
250,000-deadweight-ton tanker was fetching a spot charter
rate of around $5,000 a day. But the bare-bones cost to run
it was $6,000 to $7,000 a day, says George Blake, a director
of Overseas Shipholding Group.
   Even today's day rates for large tankers of close to
$30,000 are $10,000 below what's needed to justify replacing
an old ship with a new one, says the tanker-owner trade
group. So, says the group's Mr. Rafgard, while the "tanker
fleet is getting older, this problem certainly will not
disappear."
   Some of the ship classification societies that inspect
vessels before they can be insured now are cracking down. "We
deleted four ships in April due to overdue maintenance or
noncompliance with requirements, and we deleted 24 in March,"
says Mr. Staalstrom of det Norske Veritas. "I'm not afraid of
old ships. I'm afraid of a management that isn't taking care
of its ships," he says. "You have accidents."
   While the cause of the Mega Borg fire is still unknown, an
inquiry has turned up 14 pieces of equipment or parts of the
ship overdue for maintenance and inspections. In the pump
room, where the fire may have begun and traditionally one of
the most dangerous areas of a tanker, oil may have been
leaking from a gauge, according to testimony at an
investigatory hearing. The captain, C.M. Mahidhara, told the
panel the ship was operating with a cracked storage tank.
   New tankers ought to be less troublesome, but that may not
be so. In recent years, large tankers have been built with
10% less steel. Architects have tried to compensate for the
lighter weight with computer-aided design, high-strength
steel and improved coatings to protect the thinner metal from
cracking and corrosion.
   Some experts endorse such designs. "Before, we had to put
in more steel because we weren't quite sure how close to the
limit we were," says Garry Beaumont, chief ship surveyor of
Lloyd's Register of Shipping, a London-based
ship-classification society. But he concedes that
strong-but-thin steel "will age faster and use up its
corrosion resistance quicker," and he frets that the next
generation of tankers is being designed with even less steel.
   Some are outraged by use of thinner steel. Modern tankers
are "flimsy and have too narrow a margin for error," says
Arthur McKenzie, director of the Tanker Advisory Center in
New York and a former Exxon Corp. shipping executive. Lloyd
Bergeson, a retired naval architect, says modern tankers may
be "perfectly adequate in strength to withstand buffeting by
ocean waves, but when they hit the ground they don't have the
strength to withstand the impact."
   Mr. Bergeson labels the Exxon Valdez, launched in 1986, an
example of "a modern ship that has been cost-engineered too
far." Another naval architect contends that the Valdez and
Exxon Long Beach, its sister ship, have the least steel
weight for their size of any U.S. tanker.
   Exxon defends the Long Beach and the Valdez, saying the
Valdez hit Bligh Reef so hard that even a double hull like
those now urged in some quarters would have torn.
   In any case, an internal Coast Guard tanker study
commissioned after that spill reveals a "significant number
of failures in ships over 700 feet in length and less than 15
years old." In particular, tankers on Alaskan runs "were
experiencing a significant number of serious structural
failures" that had frequently resulted "in significant loss
of cargo," the study says.
   Quality of construction in newer vessels is also a
problem, the Coast Guard says, so it is increasing
inspections of some U.S. tankers. "We found that the
workmanship in the shipyards with high-tensile steel was not
as good," says Adm. Joel D. Sipes, chief of the agency's
Office of Marine Safety, Security and Environmental
Protection. He says shipbuilders have difficulty welding the
material, and often internal framework is improperly
designed.
   Three months before the Exxon Valdez spill, oil was
discovered leaking one night from a tanker called the
Thompson Pass while it was loading crude at the Port of
Valdez. Some 71,000 gallons spilled, most of which was
recovered. Divers discovered three long fractures in the
ship's bottom plating, according to an Alaskan
water-pollution report. It concluded that fractures in the
Thompson Pass, built in 1978, were "most probably a result of
original construction heat-treatment procedures, plus nine
years of North Pacific operations."
   Says William Lockwood, president of Interocean Management
Corp. of Philadelphia, manager of the ship: "We have had a
problem with the design and have taken steps to correct it"
by adding structural members to alleviate stresses.
   Another big problem with tanker transport is that many
vessels now operate with a third less personnel than a decade
ago. "We have seen a dramatic decline in the size of crews,
and critical tasks are falling to a very few number of
people," says John Bobb, of the Maritime Institute of
Technology Graduate Studies, which trains officers in
Linthicum Heights, Md. "Fatigue is beginning to take its
toll," he says.
   In its report following the Exxon Valdez spill, the Coast
Guard devotes an entire section to oil-tanker crew fatigue
and manning problems. Sixteen-hour work days are common, it
says. Coast Guard inspectors tell of talking to chief mates
immediately after their arrival in port to set up inspection
schedules. "Some mates were so exhausted that they fell
asleep during these meetings," the report says.
   Aboard the Union Oil Co. tanker Coast Range, "a lot of
machinery is not taken care of because we have no time," says
boatswain George Lua. "There aren't enough people. There's
just too much work." The ship, which makes frequent stops
between Puget Sound and Los Angeles, "is in and out of port
so much that we are too busy hooking up hoses and tying up
the ship, docking and undocking," to do regular maintenance,
Mr. Lua says.
   A Unocal spokesman dismisses Mr. Lua's grievances as a
"standard seaman's complaint." The spokesman says, "You'll
get that comment from any seaman that there isn't enough time
to do the work." He says the Coast Range is a modern,
well-maintained, double-bottom tanker.
   A short-handed and exhausted crew on the Greek tanker
World Prodigy contributed to the spill last June of 290,000
gallons of oil into Narragansett Bay, according to a suit
filed against the ship's owners by Rhode Island. The weather
was clear and the seas tranquil that afternoon. But Captain
Iakovas Georgoudis had been working almost nonstop for a full
day and a half before the ship hit a reef, he told a National
Transportation Safety Board hearing.
   Then the half-hour preceding the accident turned hectic.
   The World Prodigy was informed it would unload at two
ports instead of one. As the tanker approached the
hard-to-navigate shoreline, the captain testified, the chief
officer went below to calculate what the ship's new distance
from the ocean floor would be following the discharge of some
of its cargo. As the only officer on the bridge, the captain
became lookout and navigator. He had to make sure his orders
were carried out, and he had to plot positions on navigation
charts. When the chief officer returned with incorrect
calculations, the captain started redoing the math himself.
As a local harbor pilot was about to board, the World Prodigy
hit a reef.
   Thomas H. Walsh Jr., an attorney for the World Prodigy
(which is managed by International Maritime Agencies Co. of
Athens), argues that the ship had the full complement of
seamen required for vessels flying the Greek flag. The
captain, he maintains, wasn't fatigued because he had been
able to take naps on a cot on the bridge. The suit is
pending.
   Tankers face some of their biggest risks pulling in and
out of port, since the ports themselves have changed little
while ships have grown. Some lanes in the Houston Ship
Channel, connecting the city's port to the Gulf of Mexico 50
miles away, are so tight that when two vessels approach each
other, one has to give way and risk grounding along the side.
Local seamen call the process "Texas Chicken."
   Last summer's Rachel B incident in the channel occurred
when the Rachel B was trying to avoid a jutting sandbank. Had
the channel been dredged, "this accident most probably would
not have happened," the Coast Guard says.
   Giant tankers too big to come into most ports pose other
problems. They anchor at sea and pump their cargo into
smaller vessels that can dock. The practice, called
"lightering," is what the Mega Borg was doing when it
exploded. The oil industry estimates giant oceangoing tankers
lighter between 42 million gallons and 63 million of crude
daily off the U.S. coastline, and the amount is increasing as
imports rise. Lightering entails risks of a collision in
addition to pump, hose or other problems that could cause a
spill. Shipping executives insist there's little hazard.
   Dave Caldow, Chevron Corp.'s assistant fleet manager and a
former captain of a vessel lightering between the Gulf of
Mexico and a port in Pascagoula, Miss., says all 16 years the
company has operated there have been incident-free.
   As was the case with the Mega Borg, most lightering occurs
beyond the 12-mile limit of U.S. waters, which basically puts
any foreign-flagged vessels involved beyond the reach of U.S.
law. "You don't have the Coast Guard on top of you," says
Gary Gehring, an instructor at the U.S. Merchant Marine
Academy in New York.
   Even in the U.S., much of the oversight -- that pertaining
to construction and maintenance -- is in the hands of
classification societies, which are paid by ship owners to
prove their vessels are worthy of insurance. But the
credibility of these organizations is under attack.
   They've become "immersed in a bitter competitive battle to
class ships," says Harry Keefe, chairman of the American
Institute of Marine Underwriters. "This has had a big impact
on their effectiveness. Some ship owners want to go with the
society that will cost them the least." Now some Scandinavian
insurance underwriters are establishing their own corps of
ship inspectors to avoid reliance on the societies.
   Foreign tankers that never enter U.S. waters need no
insurance for oil spills. If they cross the territorial
boundary they must post bond with the Coast Guard based on
their size, but it's a minimum. For instance, though it had
some $700 million of insurance, the Mega Borg legally had to
have just $10.3 million, insufficient for a major cleanup.
   Current law puts all the liability on the tanker owner,
not on the owner of the oil it's carrying. Congress is
considering whether also to make the owner of the oil
partially liable.
   Congress is also considering raising minimum liability
insurance levels and setting maximums, a move opposed by many
in the oil industry. "As you continue to raise liability
requirements and punishments, you're going to have good
operators say it's not worth putting myself in jeopardy,"
says Jerry Aspland, president of Atlantic Richfield Co.'s
marine subsidiary.
   ARCO plans to stop transporting other companies' oil on
its tankers through Cook Inlet, Alaska, because of spill
liability fears. And already, one of the world's largest oil
companies, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is curbing the number of
its ships in U.S. waters and will hire more independents
instead.
   The most controversial solution has been the push for
double hulls. Proponents argue that by adding a second,
protective hull on the bottom and sides of a tanker, spills
from groundings and collisions might be reduced.
   Critics -- and there are many among oil executives -- say
any extra protection isn't worth the expense, though it's
unclear what that would be. Some advocates say a double hull
adds 5% and 8% to the cost of a new $90 million tanker built
in a Far Eastern shipyard. But others advocate designs that
could raise costs as much as 25%. Opponents also argue that
double-hulled tankers face a greater risk of losing bouyancy
after a severe grounding, complicating salvage efforts.
   Some propose more offshore unloading facilities like the
giant Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, a platform 19 miles off
the coast but designated by law as a U.S. port. Tankers
unload about 42 million gallons of crude a day that moves to
shore via pipeline. Built by five oil companies for about
$800 million, the facility says it has had no major spill in
its eight years of operation. Advocates say if there were
one, it would be a long way from beaches.
   Phillips Petroleum Co. says it and other companies are
looking at the idea of building such a port off Texas. Cost
estimates range from $500 million to $1 billion. That's
substantially less, proponents note, than the more than $2
billion Exxon has spent so far for its Alaskan cleanup.

           The Perils of Transporting Oil by Sea
                                                                                                       

   Among the most common problems and mishaps facing oil
tankers:
                                                                                                       

   -- Fires and Explosion. These can happen at almost any
stage of a tanker's journey but are most likely when the
tanks are empty (the ballast voyage). Fumes trapped in the
tanks are ignited by sparks generated by the cleaning
process. Vapors can also build up in the pump room, which may
have been the case in the Mega Borg spill.
                                                                                                       

   -- Collisions at the entrance to or in ports. In the
collision of the Phillips Oklahoma and another ship in the
River Humber, England, in September 1989, its side tanks were
penetrated and it lost 750 tons of crude oil.
                                                                                                       

   -- Breakups in heavy weather. In 1988-89 three tankers --
the Athenian Venture, carrying 30,000 tons of products, the
Odyssey, carrying 130,000 tons of oil, and the Maasguar,
carrying 30,000 tons of chemicals -- all sank fully loaded,
with the loss of all 79 crew members.
                                                                                                       

   -- Running Aground while entering or leaving ports. This
has caused many spills including the disastrous Exxon Valdez
spill in March 1989.
                                                                                                       

   -- Overflows while loading or discharging oil. In August
1989 the Minerva over-filled tanks and discharged 2 tons of
crude into the Delaware River.
                                                                                                       

   -- Hull Cracks, especially on large American tankers
making the Alaska run. In January 1989 the hull of the Cove
Leader cracked while loading in Alaska, spilling 10 tons of
crude.
                                                                                                       

   -- Poor Maintenance and poor design. These may have
contributed to the loss of a plate on the Pacificos, which
spilled 10,000 tons of oil off the coast of Africa in October
1989.
                                                                                                       

   -- Contact Damage. Hitting the dock or another ship can
rupture the hull. In 1989 the Stolt Sea was hit while moored
at Avondale, La., on the Mississippi River, losing 200 tons
of bunker fuel oil.

   There is a certain uneasiness in the United States
concerning loss of jobs for Americans and migration flows
from Mexico that could result from a free trade agreement. In
my opinion, this uneasiness is unfounded. In Mexico, we seek
to export goods, not labor. To date, the lack of
opportunities in Mexico and better paid jobs on the other
side of the border have been the main driving forces behind
Mexican migration. I am convinced that greater access for
Mexican goods to the United States market and major
investment in Mexico will provide better job opportunities in
my country, together with a lesser and more orderly flow of
workers.

   Judge Says FDIC
   Cannot Use Claim
   In Texas Bank Vote

   DALLAS -- A U.S. bankruptcy judge ruled that the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. can't use its $1 billion claim
against First RepublicBank Corp. for voting purposes when
creditors decide the fate of the company's plan to emerge
from Chapter 11 proceedings.
   The preliminary ruling by Judge Steven Felsenthal
increases the likelihood that creditors will approve the plan
and cast doubt on some of the legal arguments the FDIC has
made in defending itself against a lawsuit filed in U.S.
district court here by some creditors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This was a stunning victory for us," said Bruce Hendry, a
creditor from Minneapolis. "I hope it leads to a settlement
with the FDIC, which is the most reasonable route for both
parties to take at this time."
   The FDIC's $1 billion claim, the largest of several it is
asserting against First RepublicBank, stems from a loan the
agency made to the company's Dallas and Houston banks shortly
before they failed in 1988. The loan was guaranteed by First
RepublicBank and a second-tier holding company, IFRB Corp.,
as well as by other banks in the company's system.
   But in his ruling, Judge Felsenthal held that the
guarantee amounted to a fraudulent conveyance of assets to
the FDIC because the holding company didn't receive an
equivalent value in return.
   The creditors "would have been far better off if the FDIC
had allowed {the Dallas bank} to fail" rather than propping
it up with a loan that eventually led all the other banks to
fail, too, Judge Rosenthal said.
   Although Judge Felsenthal's ruling is preliminary and only
concerns the FDIC's ability to vote its claims in the
bankruptcy case, attorneys for creditors were cheered by his
determination that the FDIC was unlikely to prevail in
certain arguments before the district court. In that case,
creditors allege that regulators acted illegally in seizing
most of First RepublicBank's banks and seek damages that
could reach into the billions of dollars.
   First RepublicBank's reorganization plan calls for the
establishment of a fund to pay the FDIC pending the outcome
of the lawsuit. First RepublicBank, which isn't related to
First Republic Bancorp of San Francisco, and IFRB list assets
totaling $384 million.
   An attorney for the FDIC said the agency may appeal the
decision.

   BONN -- West German exports are expected to rise 7.2% this
year, as demand for capital goods continues to be strong,
according to a survey by the Association of German Chambers
of Commerce and Industry of 45 commercial offices that
represent the country abroad.
   Export growth will slow from last year's 12.5% rate of
increase, the survey found, but the organization said this is
still good, in view of a general slowdown in world trade
growth. The continued rise in exports underlines the strong
position West German industry has managed to maintain
internationally, the association said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A regional breakdown shows that an 8.5% increase in
exports is likely to other member nations of the European
Community, which account for 72% of West Germany's total
shipments abroad. Exports to North America are expected to
drop 4.3% this year, after a 2.5% increase in 1989; the
reversal reflects the strength of the mark against the
dollar, which makes German exports relatively expensive.

   Coors's Discharges
   Polluted Streams,

   Adolph Coors Co. violated Colorado water law by
discharging contaminated groundwater into nearby streams
without a permit and without notifying state water
authorities, the Colorado Department of Health's Water
Quality Control Division said.
   According to the agency, groundwater contaminated with
organic chemicals, including one probable carcinogen, were
released from a well under the company's can plant into Clear
Creek, a source of water for five municipalities, from 1982
to 1985.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, groundwater contaminated with a petrochemical
compound was released into the drainage from 1978 to 1989
from another site near the plant, the agency said.
   The discharges stopped when Coors began treating the
contaminated groundwater in its own treatment plant. But that
also was a violation of state law, says the water agency,
because the company didn't get a permit to treat water with
those chemicals.
   The violations carry fines of as much as $10,000 daily,
and Coors's illegal discharges continued for more than 4,000
days. Daily fines are usually levied in contamination cases
of much shorter duration, said David Holm, director of the
state's water quality division. He said he couldn't estimate
what the fine for Coors ultimately might be.
   Although no fish kills or other visible impact from the
pollution was recorded in Clear Creek during the discharges,
"there were very likely days when contaminants would have
exceeded water quality standards," said Mr. Holm.
   Sandra Woods, Coors vice president, environmental affairs,
said the company doesn't believe the contamination ever
presented a risk to consumers, employees or Coors's
neighbors. She added that the company is certain that no
contaminants from the polluted groundwater ended up in the
beer. Although traces of trichlorethane, a non-carcinogen,
were found in some of the brewing water at the time of the
discovery, the amounts were far below government standards.
The water quality division said it "is highly unlikely that
such chemicals would have survived the brewing process."
   The state agency and the company will begin negotiations
soon to determine what penalties should be levied. If an
agreement isn't reached in informal talks, a formal hearing
will be set, Mr. Holm said. Ms. Woods said she thinks the
matter will be resolved within 30 days, and the penalties
"will be very fair to Coors."

   Ask Scott McNealy, the chairman of fast-growing Sun
Microsystems Inc., who his competitors are, and he names
Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and
International Business Machines Corp.
   What about NCR Corp., the fifth-largest U.S. computer
maker and twice Sun's size? "We never see them," he says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   NCR, founded in 1884 as National Cash Register Co., is
easy to miss. Based in blue-collar Dayton, Ohio -- light
years from the glitz of California's Silicon Valley -- NCR
dominates the slow-growing banking and retail-automation
markets but remains an also-ran in computers.
   "This is the invisible computer company," says George
Colony, the president of Forrester Research Inc., a
consulting firm. "It's an old-line, quiet, conservative
company that wants desperately to change that."
   So NCR is reinventing itself -- again. Last time, when it
made the wrenching change from mechanical to electronic cash
registers and computers in the 1970s, NCR shed tens of
thousands of workers, retooled its sprawling, obsolete
factories and invested heavily in new technology. Now, NCR is
shifting its strategy to keep up with the dizzying pace of
technological change in the 1990s.
   "I've been in this business 36 years, I've learned a lot
-- and most of it doesn't apply anymore," says Charles E.
Exley, chairman and chief executive.
   NCR's effort to spark new growth shows how tough it is for
old-line companies to hit the technological fast track.
Analysts say NCR was one of the first computer makers to
learn the hard lessons of a slower growing, more competitive
sales environment. It trimmed its work force and tightened
its inventories even as it expanded its market share in
profitable niches, often at the expense of much larger
competitors. In automatic teller machines, for example, NCR
vaulted past IBM last year to become the global market
leader.
   It wasn't enough. NCR's annual sales hit a plateau at $6
billion and have stayed there since 1988. Earnings fell 15%
in the 1990 first quarter after having been essentially flat
at about $420 million a year for three years. "We saw the big
opportunities in the 1980s, but we never really got our hands
on them," Mr. Exley says. Competitors joke that NCR hasn't
had a true technological innovation since its founder put a
bell on cash-register drawers to stem pilferage.
   Now, in the 1990s, another big opportunity is unfolding:
for fast, low-cost computers based on standard chip designs
and using standard software. This time, Mr. Exley is
determined to catch the wave. With a fervor unmatched by the
other old-line computer makers, he has recast the whole
company around the new standards. He has struck alliances
with small, fast-moving companies with hot technologies, is
spending lavishly on advertising and is pouring more money
than ever into research. He has shaken up NCR's strait-laced
executive ranks. And he has hired an outsider, a 38-year-old
California computer whiz named Philip M. Neches, as chief
scientist, senior vice president and a member of the
executive committee.
   Mr. Neches, who got the key job of breathing new life into
the company's research, seems somewhat out of place in the
staid senior ranks of NCR. But the importance of his role as
a catalyst for innovation was underscored on his first day on
the job early last year: When moving into his office, he
noticed a small brass plaque on his desk, identifying it as
belonging to NCR's founder, the renowned 19th-century
industrialist John Patterson. "There was a message there," he
says. "Now, I just have to live up to the furniture."
   NCR's efforts have begun to pay off. Last month, it
unveiled what is being hailed as the fastest personal
computer on the market, designed around Intel Corp.'s
top-of-the-line 80486 chip. PC Week says the computer turned
in the best overall performance of its class in recent tests;
ByteWeek, another industry publication, says the new PC shows
that NCR "has transformed itself in the last year from just
another PC cloner to a rising star in high-end systems." And
David Evans, vice president for information systems at J.C.
Penney Co., says, "Pound for pound, it's going to be
competitive with anything on the market."
   NCR's nascent PC business got a big boost when
Businessland Inc., the largest PC retailer, started selling
NCR machines last November, giving it coveted shelf space in
the critical retail-sales channel. But the prize lost some of
its luster when Compaq Computer Corp., a smaller, nimbler
competitor, returned to Businessland's shelves to compete
with NCR after Compaq and Businessland resolved a spat over
product direction and profit margins.
   NCR also is developing new designs, using standard chips,
at the highest reaches of computing power. It bought an
equity stake in and formed a joint venture with Teradata
Corp., a fast-growing California computer maker, with the
goal of building huge computers out of hundreds of standard
chips. Computer designers say this so-called massively
parallel approach could, for many tasks, achieve much the
same performance as IBM mainframes at sharply lower cost.
   The Teradata venture should close a costly gap in NCR's
product line and stanch a hemorrhage of sales as customers
demand more power. Beginning about three years ago, for
example, Lego Systems Inc., an Enfield, Conn., toy maker,
dropped NCR computers when its needs outpaced the technology
that NCR could deliver. It now uses Digital machines
throughout its operation, says David Krall, director of
information systems.
   Another NCR shortcoming, current and former customers say,
was the lack of software such as accounting or order-entry
packages for NCR's proprietary-design computers. "Software
has been NCR's weakest area," says Jon Linden, a senior vice
president at Ritter Food Corp., of Elizabeth, N.J., who uses
both NCR and Digital systems.
   NCR's customers say standard systems will make hundreds of
additional software packages available to them. And although
NCR says it will continue full support for buyers of its
proprietary-design computers, it has emphasized that its
future lies with what it calls its "open, cooperative
computing" approach and such standards as Microsoft Corp.'s
DOS and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Unix.
   NCR isn't the only big computer maker to embrace open
standards, which have become something akin to motherhood in
the industry. But some analysts say NCR might have more
credibility than its competitors with customers, who are
often suspicious of computer makers, such as Digital and IBM,
that still depend on sales of proprietary-design computers
for most of their profits. After all, NCR was the first big
computer maker to embrace Unix in commercial systems, back in
1981.
   There's another, less flattering reason why NCR's
commitment to standards might increase its credibility with
skeptical customers: Its proprietary lines aren't going
anywhere. They now account for about $900 million, or some
14%, of sales. "It's essentially a dying product line,"
Ritter Food's Mr. Linden says. But he isn't much worried
about his investment. "NCR is going to standards, and we are,
too."
   For major computer makers, proprietary systems can be both
cash cow and curse, says Peter Labe, an analyst at Labe,
Simpson &amp; Co., a New York securities firm. As standards
spread from the desktop to larger, commercial-strength
machines, he says, "proprietary computers will begin to be
seen as an anchor around the necks of the big companies."
Steven Milunovich, a First Boston Corp. analyst, says NCR's
weakness in proprietary computers "could actually turn into
an advantage."
   But there are profound risks, too, in the shift to
standards. Because customers are freed from dependence on a
single company's computer design, they are far more likely to
buy from the lowest-cost producer. David Carlson, senior vice
president at K mart Corp., applauds NCR's new strategy as
"bold and visionary." But in a recent competitive bid for
2,500 personal computers, Mr. Carlson turned to Unisys Corp.
"NCR was a finalist, but Unisys offered us slightly better
price performance at the time," he says.
   Mr. Exley insists that NCR will be price-competitive with
high-end rivals such as IBM and Compaq but won't try to sell
computers at bargain-basement prices. He contends that
superior engineering and world-wide service and support will
win customers for whom price alone isn't decisive. And NCR's
track record in banking and retail businesses will give it a
running start, he says.
   Investors shouldn't expect NCR's more aggressive strategy
to pay off right away. Nonetheless, the stock has performed
well and is up about 15% since January, buoyed by wave after
wave of buy-backs. Takeover rumors circulating last year have
died out.
   Mr. Exley concedes that NCR's revenue and earnings "are
likely to bounce around a bit" and that growth will stay in
single digits this year. Meanwhile, NCR's strong service
business and such low-tech sidelines as business forms will
continue to provide the bulk of operating profits. But he
says that the workstation and PC division broke into the
black last month and will be profitable for the year, and
that international sales, especially in Japan, remain strong.
   The biggest challenge from within, current and former
executives say, is getting the sales force to deliver. "NCR
is an enormous organization, and it isn't going to change
overnight," says Ronald Stanczak, a former executive. "Can
they get everyone marching the same way at the same time?
That's the real question."
   It's all uncharted territory. "We're a 106-year-old, $6
billion startup," says Mr. Neches, the chief scientist.
   Gilbert Williamson, NCR's president, adds: "You have to be
the one to obsolete your own technology, or someone else will
do it for you. NCR has had to learn that lesson more than
once -- and we don't plan to go through it again."

   A roundup in recent days of Red Army Faction suspects in

soldiers -- and mob attacks last week on dissidents in
Romania tell us something both about the past and the
present. The German investigations will confirm what
anti-terrorist forces in the West have long had cause to
believe -- that much of Western Europe's terrorism and
political violence have been stage-managed by the secret
police of Communist countries. The assaults in Bucharest by
"miners" while authorities turned a blind eye make it clear
that in some East European countries the word Communist has
been expunged, but not the tactics.
   East Germany's new Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel
Friday called the links to terrorism of the former government
"one of the most shameful chapters" in East German history.
Yesterday the East German police arrested yet another
suspected member of the Red Army Faction, thought to have
been involved in the 1981 bombing of the U.S. Ramstein Air
Base. On Saturday, authorities arrested a 40-year-old woman
wanted in connection with the 1985 murder of a U.S. soldier
outside a discotheque near Wiesbaden.

   German investigators say their arrests show that the
former Stasi, or East German secret police, had regularly
offered refuge, false identities and political protection to
West Germans being sought for terrorism. The wave of arrests
in recent days has focused particularly on the Red Army
Faction, which has claimed "credit" for a long string of
terrorist crimes, including the murder in November of Alfred
Herrhausen, the highly respected head of Deutsche Bank.
   Mr. Diestel clearly has learned enough from the Stasi
files to know that such groups were not merely crazies but
were instruments of a government. The crimes were in fact
committed by a Communist state hostile to the West.
   That tells a lot more than some people have cared to know
about the sources of terrorism in Europe. One of the most
spectacular in the long list of crimes was, of course, the
shooting of Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Square in 1981
by the Turk Mehmet Ali Agca. Although Italian authorities
never chose to directly accuse other governments of
instigating the attempt, investigations of Mr. Agca's
pre-crime activities leave little doubt. His sojourns in
Bulgaria and East Berlin, where someone of his background
would have been known to the secret police, and the aid he
received from Sergei Antonov, a Bulgarian state airline
employee, were part of a damning chain of evidence.
   Obviously the world is not as easily fooled by such tricks
as it once was. Who can really believe that a group of
ordinary Romanian miners organized themselves and arranged
transportation to Bucharest and other cities in a spontaneous
show of support for Romania's President Iliescu?
   But some credulity gaps remain to be closed. Defectors
from East European governments over the past two decades have
testified that East European secret police organizations, by
and large, operated under the guidance of that vast mother
organization in Moscow, the KGB. The KGB still is very much
in business. Moscow insiders say its funding has been
expanded by Mikhail Gorbachev for two reasons: It has lost
important assets, such as Stasi; and keeping the KGB happy is
vital to a Soviet leader attempting a major reform.
   According to an article on this page in November 1984 by
Zdzislaw M. Rurarz, former Polish ambassador to Japan, the
Polish secret police were under KGB guidance at the time of
the assassination of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, a Polish
Catholic priest. He had become a thorn in the side of the
Communist Party.
   Last month, a BBC documentary offered impressive evidence
that a Soviet KGB officer assisted efforts to inflame
Czechoslovakians against the old Stalinist regime. The plot
was to replace the Stalinists with a new Communist leadership
more to Mr. Gorbachev's liking. The effort failed and Vaclav
Havel, definitely not Mr. Gorbachev's man, has just been
elected president of the Czech and Slovak Republics.
   Europe has changed dramatically in a year as the Poles,
the Czechoslovakians, the Hungarians and the East Germans
have shucked off Communist regimes. Continuing investigations
in East Germany will shed much light on what has gone on
before. But the age of state-supported thuggery is not yet
over by any means. It's always good to keep that in mind.

   Mutual Funds:
   Bargain-Hunting in Foreign Stock Funds

   Big Discounts Hurt
   Some, Lure Others

MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)
</IN>
<LP>
   The world may have ended for some investors in publicly
traded stock funds, but the smart-money crowd is licking its
chops.
   Lured by the huge run-up in the stock price of Spain Fund
and Germany Fund in late 1989, many investors loaded up on
funds that buy foreign stocks, especially the single-country
funds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But none of these funds ever matched the dizzying heights
reached by the Spain and Germany funds, so disgruntled
investors have been dumping their shares of these foreign
closed-end funds. For bargain hunters, that spells
opportunity.
   Here's why. A closed-end fund is so called because it
issues only a fixed number of shares, which then trade
publicly like any other stock. Shares in new closed-ends are
sold at a premium to the value of the fund's portfolio,
though most closed-end funds eventually fall to discounts and
bargain-hunters can buy $1 of assets for, say, 85 cents.
That's what's happening now with the foreign closed-ends.
   First Philippine Fund, for instance, closed yesterday at
$9.50 a share, down from $18 in November. Future Germany
Fund, which hit a high of $19.25 on its first day of trading
in February, is now at $14.125. Both funds trade at steep
discounts to the value of their portfolios.
   Investors tend to buy closed-ends either because of a fund
manager's track record or because of a fund's discount. But
lately, it's been possible to buy funds that boast both steep
discounts and good management.
   Richard Barone, chairman of Cincinnati's Maxus Investment
Group, likes to buy closed-end funds that are at bargain
prices. But he doesn't simply buy the funds with the deepest
discounts. Instead, he uses a computer to root out those
funds trading at discounts that are bigger than usual.
   On that basis, Mr. Barone has lately been eyeing Alliance
New Europe, Growth Fund of Spain, Swiss Helvetia Fund and
Turkish Investment Fund. Alliance New Europe, for instance,
has traded at an average discount of 6.3% since its launch
this year. But yesterday, it closed at $9.75, a 14% discount
to its $11.30-a-share portfolio value.
   Unlike Mr. Barone, Kenneth Gregory of Litman/Gregory &amp;
Co., a San Francisco investment adviser, buys funds primarily
because of the fund manager's track record. "For a closed-end
fund to make sense for us, it has to have the same appeal as
an open-end {mutual fund}, which is that we believe in the
management," Mr. Gregory says.
   But though Mr. Gregory doesn't buy a closed-end fund just
because it has a fat discount, he also is intrigued by
Alliance New Europe. He points out that the fund is run by
Glenn Wellman, who also runs Alliance International, a
top-performing mutual fund. Over the past five years,
Alliance International has returned 27.7% a year, compared
with 25% for the average international fund tracked by Lipper
Analytical Services.
   Alliance New Europe was launched in early May but isn't
yet fully invested in stocks. Mr. Wellman says he eventually
hopes to have 20% of the fund's assets in unquoted securities
and 40% in companies with market values of less than $500
million. The rest of the fund assets will be in
larger-company stocks. Mr. Wellman has already bought
positions in two Hungarian companies, Graboplast, a specialty
textile maker, and Ibusz, a tour operator that is about to be
listed on Vienna's stock exchange.
   Another closed-end that combines both a fat discount and a
well-regarded fund management company is Scudder New Europe.
The fund, which is managed by New York's Scudder, Stevens &amp;
Clark, came public in February at $12.50 a share but closed
yesterday at $10.125, a 15% discount to its portfolio value.
   Fund manager Carol Franklin has recently been buying
smaller companies like Caird Group, a British
waste-management company, and Fika Finanz AG, a Swiss
supplier of construction chemicals. But like Alliance's Mr.
Wellman, Ms. Franklin is also looking for unquoted
securities. The fund, for instance, has bought a part share
in a twin-hulled cruise ship now being built in Finland. The
ship should go into service in 1992, and Ms. Franklin hopes
the stock will be launched publicly soon after.
   Ronald Olin, a closed-end fund specialist who runs
Houston's Deep Discount Advisors, says the discounts on most
foreign closed-ends aren't yet big enough to tempt him. But
he is interested in Templeton Value, a global small-company
stock fund that has 39% of its assets invested in the U.S.
   Templeton Value's prospectus says that if the fund trades
at an average discount of 5% or more during the 12 weeks
leading up to June 30 or Dec. 31, then shareholders should
get a chance to vote on converting the fund to a regular
mutual fund. That would eliminate the fund's discount, which
yesterday stood at 11%.
   Whether or not Templeton Value converts to a mutual fund,
the fund's shareholders are at least in good company. Last
August and September, mutual fund maven John Templeton bought
$1.4 million of the fund's shares, saying that he was bullish
on emerging growth stocks. The shares now trade slightly
below Mr. Templeton's buying price.

   Investors have been bailing out of closed-end funds that
buy foreign stocks, so many of these funds are now trading at
bargain prices.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Hale the King at Gentled Medinah

   Medinah, Ill. -- What is so rare as a "fair" U.S. Open
golf course in June? How about one that's "benign" (Tom
Watson), "docile" (Greg Norman) or "defenseless" (Curtis
Strange)? Compared with those adjectives, the golfing
tourists' traditional lip-smacking appellation of "fair"
seemed mild.
   So they had the annual U.S. Open war at dreaded Medinah
Country Club here, as scheduled and then some, but the enemy
didn't show up. For three days, greens-softening rain and the
breezeless heat of an overdue Chicago summer bared the old
playground of the Ancient Order of Nobles of the Mystic
Shrine of North America to indignities too awful to
enumerate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Well, not quite too awful. Before the second of the four
days of regulation play was completed, the Open record for
most sub-par rounds fell, and it would be nearly doubled (at
124) before the swinging ceased. The 36-hole cut was made
after 145 strokes, tying the mark for lowest ever in 90 of
these things. Twenty-eight players broke par of 288 over 72
holes, which was 28 more than had done it in two previous
Opens here, in 1949 and '75, when par was 284 over shorter
yardage.
   And in the end, it almost didn't end, maybe because the
guys were having so much fun, but mostly because the U.S.
Golf Association's blue-blazer brigade, having nothing better
to do on Mondays, stands alone in big-time sports in
decreeing that ties be broken by a full-day's extra play.
Hale Irwin, a noted blaster from the past, and Mike Donald,
heretofore largely anonymous, were in it, by virtue of having
tied at eight-under-par 280 strokes after the 72 regular
holes.
   They tied again Monday at plus-two 74 over the extra 18 as
Medinah, aided by drier weather and gusty winds, exacted a
measure of revenge. We wound up with sudden-death anyway, and
Irwin's eight-foot birdie putt on the 385-yard, par-four
first hole finally won it.
   The 45-year-old Irwin became the oldest guy to win the big
silver cup, providing the middle-aged with a rare whiff of
sporting glory that was cruelly snuffed when 47-year-old Ray
Floyd came up just short at the Masters in April. Irwin is a
three-time winner of this thing, the other times coming in
1974 and '79. His hair is cut shorter now and he wears
contact lenses instead of specs. Both are changes for the
better, I'd say.
   He's a part-time tourney player now, but avers that his
game hasn't changed much from those days. "I still keep the
ball in play and hit good iron shots," he said after his
triumph. "I didn't putt all that well today, but I guess I
wasn't so bad, either, because I'm here.
   "Tenacity is something I've always had," he declared, and
then added a prescient note. "A couple weeks ago I had a
dream I'd won the Open; my wife can verify it," said he. "I
can't remember the specifics, but I do remember it was an
ordeal, just like this was."
   Irwin's win will go into the books on the basis of more
than just age and repetition. He put together two memorable
charges, one to gain a share of the lead from four strokes
back in Sunday's fourth round, and another to recover from a
two-stroke deficit with three holes to go in Monday's
playoff.
   Indeed, Sunday dawned with perhaps the closest-bunched
field in the event's history. The leader board was topped at
seven-under-par 209 by two fellas with scant credentials for
such eminence: Floridian Donald, 34, who had but one tourney
win to show for his 11 years of traveling with golf clubs,
and Billy Ray Brown, 27, a large, soft-featured Texan with
none to show for his three.
   Four players were bunched one stroke behind them, six more
were two strokes back, including 1988 and '89 winner Strange,
and seven more were another shot distant. Irwin was tied with
seven others at 213 after rounds of 69, 70 and 74, a sizable
sand dune to climb at this Levantine layout.
   Irwin teed off Sunday in the company of the white-blond
Norman, hardly the sort who puts his playing partners in the
spotlight, and through the first 10 holes the pair's gallery
swelled to watch Sharky surge to six under par from two
under. But as Norman faded Irwin reeled off birdies on 11,
12, 13 and 14 -- none on putts of longer than 12 feet.
   And on 18, a 440-yard par four, he sank a 45-or-so-foot
birdie putt that gave him a 67 for the day and the lead in
the clubhouse. That so exhilarated him he ran a victory lap
around the green, high-fiving spectators as we went. "Never
ran that far with an interception at {the U. of} Colorado,"
the ex-Buffalo defensive back admitted.
   Strange's bid for three in a row died with his Sunday 75,
but two other players made serious runs. Britisher Nick
Faldo, who'd skewered poor Floyd at Augusta, had a 15-footer
to tie Irwin on 18, but it lipped out as Nick bit his. Brown
putted one of about the same length there with about the same
result, although his perspective was different. "Some people
didn't think I'd hold up as far as I did. I wasn't so sure,
either, but I did," grinned the pleased third-placer.
   Donald's challenge to Irwin was, of course, the most
serious and sustained. A likable man with a cleft chin, he'd
previously reached public consciousness by capturing the
Anheuser-Busch Classic last year after long and winless
travail, and by following a field-leading 64 in the first
round of this year's Masters with an 82.
   "That wasn't a choke -- I just didn't have the game to
follow up my good first round," he said Sunday of that
debacle. "I've worked, and I think now I do."
   Donald opened birdie-birdie on Sunday, and would have
negated the playoff if not for his only bogey of the day -- a
five on the 426-yard 16th hole caused by a trapped three-iron
approach. On Monday, he went two strokes up after 12 holes
after a badly pulled wood shot from the rough led to Irwin's
fourth bogey of the afternoon.
   But on the par-five 14th Irwin got his first birdie to
match one by Donald, and on 16 he cut the lead to one when a
six-foot putt gave him another. On 18, Donald hit his only
really bad tee shot of the day, and followed it with an
equally bad trap shot that kept him from matching Irwin's
par.
   On the decisive 19th, Donald thin-hit a wedge well short,
then putted to within two feet. Irwin planted his wedge shot
eight feet from the pin, and putted true.
   "I don't remember hitting it {that last putt}, but I
remember it going in," said the champ. So will lots of
others.

   Campeau Units
   Post Losses Smaller
   Than Anticipated

   CINCINNATI -- Campeau Corp.'s retailing units, Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., reported net
losses for the first quarter that were little changed from a
year earlier, but the units said the losses were smaller than
expected.
   In their first report on quarterly earnings since filing
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy status in January, Federated said
it had a net loss of $57.6 million in the 13 weeks ended May
5, compared with $62.2 million a year earlier. Allied,
meantime, posted a net loss of $41.9 million, compared with
$40.3 million. The latest results included costs related to
the reorganization of Federated and Allied of $4.8 million
and $14.9 million, respectively.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Factoring out the reorganization costs, Janet Mangano, a
retail analyst at Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York, said losses
narrowed from year-earlier levels, underlining her belief
that Federated and Allied will be profitable by the final
quarter of the year.
   Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive of Allied and
Federated, said in a statement that the latest results
"exceeded our expectations for how the business would perform
in the period immediately following the Chapter 11 filings."
   Sales figures also were better than company projections
made in April, when Federated and Allied said they expected
sales for the two units to dip 3% for the quarter. Instead,
combined sales were down just 0.5%.
   Federated alone reported sales of $1.01 billion, down from
$1.03 billion a year earlier. Allied's sales rose to $581.4
million from $572.5 million.
   The companies said the latest period's sales performance
came despite disruptions in receipts of merchandise early in
the quarter, when wholesalers held back shipments as the
companies readied their Chapter 11 filings. They said
shipments were back to normal by the end of the quarter and
sales trends were "strengthening."
   Net interest expenses declined in the latest period,
amounting to $93.5 million at Federated and $67.8 million at
Allied. This compared with year-earlier net interest expense
for Federated and Allied of $120.3 million and $67.8 million,
respectively.
   However, operating cash flow also was lower. Operating
cash flow, defined as earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization and costs related to their
bankruptcy-law status, is regarded as the most accurate
measure of their business under Chapter 11.
   At Federated, operating cash flow declined to $62.6
million from $84.2 million. Allied had operating cash flow of
$34.3 million, down from $40.6 million.
   Ms. Mangano, the Josephthal analyst, said it wasn't
surprising that operating cash flow didn't cover interest
expenses, given that the first quarter is traditionally the
weakest for retailers.
   Federated also said it had $419 million in cash on hand as
of June 6, compared with $18.8 million a year earlier.
Allied's cash on hand amounted to $189 million, compared with
none.

   Newport Pharmaceuticals Drug Slows
   Onset of AIDS, European Study Suggests

   A study by researchers in Sweden and Denmark suggested
that a controversial drug developed by Newport
Pharamceuticals International Inc. may delay the onset of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome in people infected with
the AIDS virus.
   But officials at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
were quick to point out that the results of the study ran
counter to other tests of the drug, called isoprinosine. The
FDA officials said that the study's results were "interesting
and provocative," but that the study's conclusions "must be
viewed with considerable caution."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The study's findings were originally scheduled to be
released tomorrow in the New England Journal of Medicine,
where a full report will appear. But the study's chief
investigator, Court Pedersen, broke the news embargo by
discussing details of the report yesterday morning at a
research meeting associated with the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS in San Francisco.
   Moreover, Newport Pharmaceuticals of Laguna Hills, Calif.,
sent out notices to the news media on Monday and yesterday
announcing that a "major" study regarding the drug's effect
on the disease was going to be released.
   The two events seem to have triggered tremendous activity
in Newport Pharmaceuticals' stock. In national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, the stock jumped 81.25
cents to close at $3.625. Volume was extremely heavy for the
small issue, with 875,900 shares changing hands.
   In the study, conducted in 1988, doctors in medical
centers in Sweden and Denmark tested 803 people who were
infected with the virus but had yet to develop full-blown
AIDS. Of 399 people given the drug, two developed AIDS, while
17 of 404 people who received a placebo progressed to the
disease.
   At the meeting at the AIDS conference, Dr. Pedersen of
Hvidovre Hospital in Copenhagen also reported the results of
a follow-up study of the same patients. He said that after 24
additional weeks, eight more patients receiving the drug
developed AIDS. The patients who had received the placebo
were given the drug during the follow-up, and 10 of those
people progressed to AIDS, he reported.
   The study's findings are especially surprising, because
several previous studies of the drug had failed to show any
benefit. Indeed, in a carefully worded editorial accompanying
the study in New England Journal, FDA officials raised
questions about various important details of the study. In
particular, the FDA staffers pointed out, as did the study's
authors, that measurements of a protein in the patients'
immune systems indicated that the drug wasn't strengthening
their ability to fight off the disease. Neither the patients
taking the drug nor those on placebo had increases in the
number of CD4 cells, substances used to measure the ability
of AIDS patients to fight off the ailment.
   The FDA officials also cautioned that in numerous other
studies over the years -- in which isoprinosine was tested
against herpes, cancer and other infections -- the drug
failed to be proven effective. The FDA has refused to approve
the drug on several occasions, and officials said a further
study of the drug would be needed to duplicate the
Scandinavian results.
   A spokesperson for Newport Pharmaceuticals said the
company is discussing plans to conduct a new test.
   Newport Pharmaceuticals has carried on a campaign for more
than 10 years to get isoprinosine approved for various uses
in the U.S. There initially was some interest in using the
drug against AIDS, because some laboratory studies indicated
that the drug boosted the effectiveness of the immune system.
Many scientists, however, are skeptical that hyping the
immune system with medication will be an effective way of
treating AIDS.
   The study's release in the prestigious New England Journal
can be expected to renew interest in the drug despite the
FDA's concerns. Understanding this, editors at the Journal
said they debated at length whether to publish the study,
knowing that its findings contradicted previous reports. The
editors said they finally agreed to release it in order to
get the data out and let other researchers attempt to
duplicate the findings.

   Dollar Falls in Thin Trading, but Yen
   Fails to Move Up Despite Japanese Data

   NEW YORK -- The dollar drifted lower against other major
currencies in thin trading. But the yen reaped few gains from
the weak U.S. currency, despite welcome economic reports in
Japan.
   In the trendless market, participants felt confident
buying currencies supported by high interest rates. As a
result, sterling closed in New York at its highest level
since the first quarter of 1989. The Australian dollar, which
rose strongly in Asian trading, added to those gains around
the globe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fluctuated in Europe and in the New York
morning between its global low on Monday of 1.6735 marks and
1.6770 marks. Twice it was stopped from falling below 1.6730
marks by strong buying interest from the Soviet Union, said
Jerry Egan, chief foreign exchange dealer for Bank of Boston.
   Explaining the unremitting downside pressure on the U.S.
currency, Mr. Egan said "there's a lot of technical bears out
there" after Monday's technical selloff against the mark.
   About midmorning in New York, on the market's third
attempt, the dollar fell below 1.6730 marks and sustained
institutional selling at 1.6715 marks. Finally, at 1.6680
marks, the U.S. currency found support, Mr. Egan said, and
bounced back above 1.67 marks.
   The dollar remained above that level the rest of the day,
partly as a result of the emergence of buying interest among
Middle Eastern investors, Mr. Egan said.
   Monday "appears to have been the keynote day," said Keith
Cheveralls, foreign exchange manager for Nippon Credit Bank
in New York, and yesterday "would appear to be a continuation
of that."
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6738
marks, down from 1.6758 marks late Monday. The U.S. currency
also stood at 153.55 yen, down from 153.66.
   At midmorning Wednesday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading
at 153.88 yen; it closed Tuesday in Tokyo at 153.72 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6773
marks, up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.6757 marks.
   On Tuesday, sterling was trading at $1.7210, well above
$1.7145 late Monday. The last time the pound closed higher in
New York was March 22, 1989, when it ended at $1.7270.
   Once again, the yen failed to match the success of other
currencies against the dollar. The Japanese currency was
sold, along with the U.S. currency, for marks and Swiss
francs.
   News that Japan's broad money supply, M2 plus certificates
of deposit, grew at a 13.2% year-on-year pace in May had
little impact on currency markets around the world, even
though Tokyo credit-market participants said the report
probably will reinforce the Bank of Japan's tight monetary
policy.
   Similarly ignored was the report that Japan's real gross
national product grew 2.5% in the fiscal fourth quarter,
making a 10.4% annual growth rate.
   "One would have thought" the economic reports would have
helped the yen yesterday, Mr. Cheveralls said, "but the
underlying environment is one of yen weakness. One could say
the fundamentals are offering a modicum of support in what
otherwise would be a weaker market for the yen."
   Mr. Cheveralls said the possibility of a political scandal
touching Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was just one
element contributing to the bearish attitude traders have
developed toward the yen.
   Looking for a way to make money in the quiet market,
investors turned to currencies supported by high interest
rates. But potential buyers are shying away from the Canadian
dollar until the constitutional dispute over Quebec is
resolved.
   The Australian dollar bounded through the 78 U.S. cents
level in Asian trading, with Japanese investors providing the
initial burst of buying. The currency stalled at 78.30 cents
when Sydney participants failed to follow through.
   Markets in Europe and North America, however, picked up
the ball, lifting the Australian dollar to an intraday high
of 78.45 cents. It closed in New York at 78.35 cents.
   The Australian currency is being supported by bank bill
and cash rates above 15%. "Until the (Australian government)
administration gives an inkling it's willing to relax
interest rates," Bank of Boston's Mr. Egan said, the
Australian dollar "is going to remain a glamorous
high-yielder."
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $349.10 an ounce, down 20 cents.
Estimated volume was a light 1.5 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $347.85 an
ounce.

   Trump Bankers Say No Progress Made

   Donald Trump's bankers said they made no progress in
bailout talks, as attention shifted to dozens of Japanese
financial institutions that are still unwilling to help the
beleaguered developer and casino owner.
   These Japanese-based creditors own pieces of $2 billion in
bank loans from Chase Manhattan Corp. and Citicorp, and must
approve a loan package that would provide Mr. Trump with what
bankers now say is $65 million. The proposal would also
suspend Mr. Trump's interest payments on all bank loans
indefinitely. In return, Mr. Trump would cede equity in many
projects to his creditors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On Friday, Mr. Trump failed to make a $43 million payment
on Trump's Castle bonds, and he has until midnight Tuesday to
cure the default or he could lose the property. Failure to
make the payment could also trigger defaults in other Trump
properties. But the developer's bankers said that, as a
practical matter, they must agree by tomorrow, to have a
reasonable chance of getting all the necessary paperwork done
in time.
   On Monday, three New Jersey banks tentatively agreed to
join the arrangement agreed to earlier by four New York
banks. That pact means that about 65 smaller creditors who
purchased pieces of loans by Chase Manhattan and Citicorp
must still approve the deal.
   These banks and leasing companies, most of which are
Japanese, have so far been unwilling to go along with the
deal. Some of the banks are unwilling to give up their
security in such relatively secured Trump projects as the
Trump Tower in Manhattan.
   Other banks are said not to have had the time to consider
the package.
   Under the proposed $65 million bailout, contributions from
the various Trump creditors breaks down as follows, according
to one individual involved in the discussions: units of
Bankers Trust New York Corp., $18.25 million; Citicorp,
$18.25 million; Chase Manhattan, $9 million; Manufacturers
Hanover Corp., $7 million; First Fidelity Bancorp, $5.5
million; National Westminster Bank, $5 million; and Midlantic
National Bank, $2 million.
   While the seven banks are putting up the $65 million, some
of the other participant banks may also make contributions.
In return, these small creditors' loans would be secured by
some of Mr. Trump's stronger properties.
   Mr. Trump has been in round-the-clock negotiations with
his banks for the past three weeks, following revelations
that he could not meet interest payments on $2 billion in
debt in the coming year. The banks say they have decided to
dismantle the Trump empire in an orderly fashion that would
avoid fire-sale prices.
   Because Mr. Trump's loans have so many different types of
collateral and involve such a large number of banks, putting
a deal together has been difficult. The goal of the banks,
say people involved in the negotiations, is to keep Mr. Trump
out of bankruptcy court, where the disposition of his assets
would be supervised by a judge.
   Mr. Trump has been meeting some obligations. The Trump
Shuttle made its regularly scheduled monthly payment of about
$1 million to Citicorp, according to a Trump official.

   Both Lawrence A. Kudlow ("What's Good for America Is Good
for Bonds," May 9) and Irving Kristol ("Inflation: Almost
Never What It Seems," May 16) are right in their
editorial-page articles to observe that the conduct of Alan
Greenspan's Fed offers no grounds to fear inflation. Yet
there is even more evidence:
   -- The price of gold has not simply been steady, it has
fallen to below $375 per ounce. If anything, this measure
indicates a slight tightening; 1980s markets were healthy and
inflation low with gold at $425 to $475.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   -- Exchange rates have exhibited less volatility than at
any time since 1973, thanks to both Mr. Greenspan and former
Treasury Secretary James Baker's G-7 initiative, causing at
least one Journal article to remark they have now become
almost "boring." While exchange rates are not the best
barometer -- it is possible to have global inflation or
deflation with steady exchange rates -- some analysts watch
them closely, and they certainly point to no inflation.
   Even the money supply, rightly understood, reinforces the
case. To find a meaningful monetary aggregate we must exclude
currency outstanding -- much of which may be finding its way
into East European and other countries where dollars are the
"de facto" money. We have this in the Fed's statistics on
non-borrowed reserves, an aggregate that, unlike M-1 through
M-3 and even the monetary base, excludes the potentially
misleading currency.
   Non-borrowed reserve growth under Mr. Greenspan: 0.5%
since taking office. In fact, reserves stood at $58.4 billion
in August 1987; at $58.4 billion in January 1988; at $58.7
billion in January 1989; and $58.7 billion in May 1990. Thus,
interest rates of 8.5% on bonds become hard to explain in
terms of legitimate inflation fears. Either the market is
ill-informed or it simply doubts the Fed will stay the course
set by Messrs. Baker and Greenspan.
   The remedy for the former is for bond buyers to wake up
and take advantage of still-high rates. The remedy for the
latter is for the Fed and current Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady to institutionalize all this price stability, gaining
what Fed Gov. Wayne Angell has rightly called the critical
"announcement effect." Monetary authorities already have done
the difficult part of establishing a commodity-backed dollar.
Why not the easy part?

   Leibler Resigning
   As Amex President
   To Join an Insurer

   NEW YORK -- Kenneth R. Leibler, president of the American
Stock Exchange for the past 4 1/2 years and one of the
best-knownfigures in the securities industry, is leaving the
Amex for a top job at Liberty Financial Cos. in Boston.
   Mr. Leibler, 41 years old, was passed over last October
when the stock exchange brought in former Congressman James
R. Jones to succeed longtime chairman Arthur Levitt Jr.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Leibler will assume the new position of president and
chief operating officer at Liberty Financial, a unit of
Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. Among the eight Liberty
Financial operating companies he'll run are Stein Roe &amp;
Farnham and Liberty Asset Management moneymanagement
companies, with combined assets under management of $15
billion, and the insurer Keystone Provident Life. Mr. Leibler
will report to Sam Marinella, chief executive officer of
Liberty Financial.
   Mr. Jones said Mr. Leibler's departure -- which apparently
caught the Amex by surprise -- is a "big loss" for the
exchange, which is a tiny stock market compared with the New
York Stock Exchange, but which has become one of the
country's major options markets. Mr. Jones said no decision
has been made about a successor or about whether a search
committee will be formed.
   The youngest president of a securities exchange when he
took over as Amex president in 1986, Mr. Leibler has worked
at the Amex for most of his career, starting with an
entry-level job in the options division 15 years ago. Joseph
Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, praised him yesterday for his knowledge of markets.
   For his part, Mr. Leibler said yesterday that he is
looking forward to the "much broader management capacity" of
his new job. "There's no doubt that when I got to this
position at age 36, this wasn't something I would do for the
next 30 years."
   He hopes the move allows him the chance for a short
vacation to indulge in his "two major passions" -- vegetable
gardening and collecting wine. He also has a passion for
business, of course. One day, "I hope to get a vineyard and
combine them all," Mr. Leibler said.
   It has been an active time in the executive suites of
major exchanges. The New York Stock Exchange's chairman, John
J. Phelan Jr., also plans to step down later this year.

   The Soviet republic of Byelorussia appealed for
international help to relocate and medically treat more than
two million people affected by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
accident.
   Byelorussia got 70% of the fallout from Chernobyl.
One-fifth of Byelorussia's more than 10 million people have
to be moved from areas contaminated by radiation, said Victor
Borovikov, a diplomat from Byelorussia.
   Speaking in Brussels, Mr. Borovikov said people were paid
by the Soviet authorities to stay in the contaminated zones
immediately after the accident, but they now are demanding
immediate relocation. "We have no experience in this field,
which is why we're asking for international help," he said.
   A major relocation problem: Mr. Borovikov said people in
uncontaminated areas don't "want to accept the newcomers.
They tell their children not to play with the children of the
newcomers."
                                                                                                       

   PHILIPPINE AIRLINES SCANDAL
                                                                                                       

   The Philippines' solicitor general has asked Philippine
Airlines to investigate "highly scandalous anomalies" that he
said may have cost the state-run airline more than two
billion pesos ($89.3 million) since 1981. Solicitor General
Francisco Chavez, a member of the airline board, said the
alleged irregularities included missing airline parts and
overpayments to travel agents.

   NORWEGIAN BROADCAST STRIKE
                                                                                                       

   Journalists at Norsk Rikskringkasting, Norway's national
radio and television authority, began a strike over a wage
dispute. During the strike, NRK radio plans to broadcast
mostly music and have only four news bulletins daily, instead
of hourly newscasts. TV newscasts will be replaced by movies
and reruns. Television officials said they would continue to
broadcast World Cup soccer games but without Norwegian
commentary.
                                                                                                       

   U.S. RETURNS OKINAWA LAND
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. has agreed to return to Japan some land used by
U.S. military bases on the Japanese island of Okinawa. A
report by the U.S.-Japan Joint Committee on Realignment and
Consolidation of U.S. Forces Facilities on Okinawa said land
totaling about 2,500 acres in 23 sites will be returned. The
schedule for the return is subject to local negotiation and
further discussions by the two governments, the Japanese
Foreign Ministry announced. The land being returned makes up
only 2.5% of the acreage taken up by U.S. military bases on
Okinawa.
                                                                                                       

   COMMUNISM IN SOUTH AFRICA
                                                                                                       

   The South African Communist Party said it would relaunch
itself officially next month after four decades underground.
General Secretary Joe Slovo told the party's first news
conference in South Africa since 1950 that its leadership
would be presented publicly at a July 19 rally in
Johannesburg's Soweto black township. Speaking about the
retreat of communism in Eastern Europe, Mr. Slovo said, "A
communist party worthy of the name cannot constitutionally
entrench its leading role -- it must earn it daily."
                                                                                                       

   CHINA PREPARES FOR A CENSUS
                                                                                                       

   In preparing to count its billion-plus population next
month, China has drafted nearly seven million census workers.
Hundreds of thousands of centers have been set up to teach
the workers how to conduct the world's biggest head count,
which begins July 1 and is scheduled to take about 10 days.
In addition, millions more Chinese have been mobilized to
hang banners in the streets and otherwise popularize the
slogan, "The population census -- everyone is responsible."
                                                                                                       

   EAST GERMAN UNEMPLOYMENT
                                                                                                       

   Nearly two million jobs could be lost in East Germany
after the currency and economic union between the two
Germanys takes effect July 1, Economics Minister Helmut
Haussmann said.
   But he said job losses would be a short-term phenomenon,
as many workers would be quickly retrained for other work.
Job losses for East Germans in inefficient state-run
industries that were modernized or shut down would be offset
by the expected creation of some 500,000 new jobs this year
in new small and medium-sized private companies.
   "This is a transitional unemployment which will be
associated with active training measures," Mr. Haussmann
said. During the transition, West Germany would provide
start-up aid for a new unemployment-insurance system that
would become self-financing when East German workers start
paying regular contributions.
   When East Germany was under communist rule, unemployment
didn't officially exist. But Mr. Haussmann estimated hidden
unemployment there at 15% of the work force, saying this was
the number of people with artificial or do-nothing jobs in
the public sector.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Interviewed in Paris, novelist Mario Vargas Llosa said he
is back to writing after his defeat in Peru's presidential
election last week. "My compatriots have returned me to
literature," he said. . . . Iran has asked Turkey to halt
screenings of the U.S. movie "The Naked Gun" because it mocks
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. A Turkish official said
the government was considering whether it was possible to
edit out the segment featuring a Khomeini look-alike with a
spiked punk hairdo under his turban.

   NEW YORK -- New American Magazine Co., the debt-laden
publisher of Smart, Psychology Today and Mother Earth News,
said it is discussing the sale of a half-interest in the
company to a Japanese publisher.
   Owen Lipstein, president and controlling shareholder of
New American, said the Japanese company, which he declined to
identify, signed a letter of intent in May to "put
substantial equity into the company."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although Japanese concerns haven't previously made any
significant investments in the U.S. publishing industry,
Veronis, Suhler &amp; Associates, the New York-based investment
banker, linked Mr. Lipstein with an interested Japanese
publisher.
   Meanwhile, Terry McDonnell, who founded Smart with Mr.
Lipstein, said that a U.S. publisher has shown "serious"
interest in purchasing the 250,000-circulation men's
life-style magazine started last year. He declined to
identify the publisher, but industry executives said Playboy
Enterprises Inc. and Straight Arrow Publishers Inc.,
publisher of Rolling Stone, are among possible bidders.
   A spokeswoman for Playboy said, "We are talking" to Smart,
"but we aren't even close to a deal. We are talking to a lot
of other magazines too." Straight Arrow executives said
through a spokesman that they are "not interested."
   Mr. Lipstein acknowledged in an interview that New
American is strapped for cash and last week laid off 30
staffers, or about 50% of the employees, at all three of the
magazines. The layoffs follow the departure of a number of
top sales and editorial executives from the staffs of the
magazines.
   A number of smaller publishers, such as New American, have
been hurt by an industrywide downturn in advertising sales,
and some consumer magazines have folded. But Mr. Lipstein
said most of the company staffers laid off will be rehired
"when new partners come aboard." And he dismissed industry
speculation that New American may soon become another
industry fatality. "We're just operating on a tighter
schedule," Mr. Lipstein said. "We are still alive."
   Earlier this year, Mr. Lipstein kept creditors and
investors at bay when he sold his flagship magazine, American
Health, to Reader's Digest Association Inc. for $29.1
million. He also halted publication of Psychology Today in
December and said it would be redesigned and relaunched this
fall.

   Gorbachev Backs New Party Structure
   In Russian State but Warns Opposition

   MOSCOW -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev opened a
crucial meeting by endorsing a new Russian Federation
Communist Party, but assailing those who want to make the new
party a stronghold of opposition to his reforms.
   The meeting of communists in the Russian Federation of the
Soviet Union is seen as a preview of next month's important
Soviet Communist Party Congress where Mr. Gorbachev is
expected to come under attack from the right and left.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Russia is the only one of the 15 Soviet republics without
its own party structure. While Mr. Gorbachev yielded to the
growing force of Russian nationalism by backing the new
party, he also warned that it shouldn't be used to increase
the separatist tensions that are straining the Soviet Union.
"We must exclude any forms of confrontation between the
Russian Federation and the Soviet Union," he said.
   Delegates to the Russian party conference voted 2,607 to
61, with 16 abstentions, to adopt the agenda proposed by Mr.
Gorbachev. Under it, they will consider the formation of the
Russian party and debate the proposed platform of the
national congress.
   The impetus for Mr. Gorbachev's reluctant endorsement of
the party was the emergence of his populist rival, Boris
Yeltsin, as the new president of the Russian Federation. Mr.
Yeltsin promotes the "sovereignty" of Russia.
   The creation of a Russian Communist Party could help Mr.
Gorbachev by offsetting Mr. Yeltsin's power. Perhaps as
important as any of the words at the first day of the
conference, was the scene of Mr. Yeltsin smiling warmly on
the dais as he chatted with Mr. Gorbachev.
   Earlier there had been rumors that Mr. Yeltsin might
resign from the Communist Party at next month's meeting, a
move that could foster a split between the party's
conservative and democratic groupings. Mr. Yeltsin's plans
still aren't clear, but his position on the dais surrounded
by Soviet politburo members helped establish an image of the
rebel as part of the central leadership.
   Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov also occupied a prominent
seat at the front of the huge hall in the Kremlin, at times
presiding over the meeting. Monday, a senior party official
suggested Mr. Ryzhkov as one possible candidate for first
secretary of a new Russian party.
   Mr. Gorbachev defended a rapid transition to a "regulated
market economy" as the completion of unfinished
de-Stalinization. The Soviet leader forcefully rejected the
arguments of the right in a way that may have a certain
appeal in a country where most people aren't sure what a
market economy is. He told a nationwide television audience
that it is ridiculous to call the movement toward a market a
step back toward capitalism. "The market existed long before
capitalism," he said.
   Mr. Gorbachev's speech was followed by attacks from both
sides. Democratic reformists, concerned that a Russian
Federation Communist Party will be controlled by
conservatives, said its creation should be postponed until
basic political concepts could be discussed and voted on by
the public. The reformers are seeking to break the party's
monopoly over government and turn it into a parliamentary
party that would have to compete for power.
   Old-line communists assailed the central leadership for
perverting the process of establishing a new party. The
leadership "has reduced the party to crouching unarmed in the
trenches under massive shelling by anti-Socialist forces,"
said delegate Ivan Osadchiy, according to Tass news service.
"Only a Communist Party of the Leninist type" can pull Russia
out of its crisis.
   Mr. Gorbachev urged the gradual separation of party from
state operations. But an ironic glimpse of the current state
of reform came when Mr. Gorbachev slipped into old patterns
and called for a vote on a motion to order state television
to fully broadcast the event.
   Only some time later, when radical Leningrad Mayor Anatoli
Sobchak took the floor and pointed out that the party has no
right to make such an order did Mr. Gorbachev reconsider.
Agreeing, he called for another vote to "reflect the reality
that all we can do is request."

   RJR Launches
   A Refinancing
   Of $5.3 Billion

   Plan With Big Holder KKR
   Will Give Conservative

   NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc. and its main shareholder,
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., have begun a $5.3 billion
refinancing effort that will drastically reshape the tobacco
and food company's balance sheet.
   The plan aims to retire more than $4 billion of RJR's
poorest-performing below-investment-grade "junk" bonds,
according to bankers who have seen the package. It is an
attempt to put the RJR buy-out on firmer financial footing in
the face of a crucial deadline for repricing part of the
high-yield debt used to take the company private.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Money for the plan would be raised from three main
sources: $2.25 billion in fresh bank borrowings by RJR, about
$1.5 billion through a preferred-stock sale by RJR, and about
$1.5 billion in an equity infusion from the large leveraged
buy-out fund that KKR controls. These proceeds would be used
to retire the junk bonds and pay off $1 billion of
increasing-rate notes later this year.
   An RJR spokesman declined to comment on the restructuring
plan.
   If the plan succeeds, bankers say, it will impose a more
conservative financial structure on RJR, which has been
highly indebted since it was acquired by KKR, a leveraged
buy-out firm, 17 months ago. The consumer-products company
would be shielded from a potential debt crisis next spring,
but KKR's potential profits would be curtailed.
   People close to KKR caution that the plan remains subject
to revision. Even so, bankers say, it is by far the most
detailed RJR refinancing scheme that KKR and its advisers
have presented so far.
   Since January, bond-market investors and KKR partners have
worried about RJR's obligations on more than $6 billion of
low-rated junk bonds. By next April, the interest rate on
those bonds must be reset to make them trade at their face
value. Those bonds have been depressed for months and are
trading now at about 76 cents on the dollar.
   At current bond prices, RJR would have to reset those
bonds to an interest rate of about 18.5%, which would chew up
much of the company's cash flow. These bonds have proved
unpopular with many investors, in part because they pay
interest in the form of more bonds, rather than in cash.
   Bankers say the RJR refinancing plan would largely
sidestep the reset quandary. Instead, RJR is proposing to buy
back all $2.19 billion outstanding of 14.07% convertible
reset debentures, and about 45%, or $1.95 billion, of 14.07%
reset exchange debentures.
   Such purchases would be huge news in the junk-bond market,
where the RJR issues are bellwethers. "The RJR bonds are
still at a big discount to their value," one large holder,
Howard Marks at Trust Co. of the West, said earlier this
week. Like many junk-bond investors, Mr. Marks has been
kicking around his own conjectures about how KKR might deal
with the reset issue.
   RJR could buy back the bonds either gradually, via
open-market purchases, or rapidly, via a tender offer at a
premium to the market price. As long as the junk bonds remain
at big discounts to face value, they are likely to be bought
at market prices. If the bonds soar, though, bank-loan
proposals have penciled in the assumption that RJR would pay
full face value for the bonds.
   Crucial to the success of the RJR refinancing will be the
response of major U.S. and foreign banks, which are being
asked to lend a further $2.25 billion to the company. Last
year, in the height of the leveraged lending frenzy, banks
lent more than $11 billion to fund the RJR buy-out. Now,
however, banks have turned much chillier toward buy-out
lending.
   RJR's four lead bank lenders, units of Manufacturers
Hanover Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Bankers Trust New York
Corp. and Citicorp, are expected to lead the new bank loan.
It wasn't clear, though, how much help they will get from
Japanese banks, which in 1989 lavished RJR with loans in $500
million amounts. "Some Japanese banks are feeling tightly
restrained about LBO lending," a Japanese banker said.
   Bankers said they are intrigued by another major source of
funding for the bond repurchases: an approximately $1.5
billion issue of convertible preferred stock by RJR. Bankers
said they expect the preferred will yield about 9% or 10%. It
also would be convertible into RJR common stock at a price of
about $10 a share, bankers said.
   Traditional investors may find the preferred stock, which
pays dividends in cash instead of paper, much more to their
liking than the junk bonds it replaces. Its issuance also
would mark a noteworthy retreat by KKR, which, through its
buy-outs, was by far the largest issuer of junk bonds in the
1980s.
   Meanwhile, KKR has told banks and KKR's outside investors
that it plans to invest between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion
of new equity in RJR, through partnerships that KKR controls.
   The exact terms under which that equity will be invested
haven't been determined. But the new equity infusion is
likely to be closely pegged to the price of RJR's warrants,
which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The
warrants, equivalent to one share of RJR's closely held
common stock, closed yesterday at $6.625 each. At the time of
the February 1989 buy-out, RJR's common was valued at $5 a
share.
   For KKR, the RJR refinancing package does bear some costs,
though far less than if the bond-reset problem had worsened.
An equity investor with KKR said he expects the annual
percentage return from the RJR buy-out will amount to
"somewhere in the mid-20s" after the new equity infusion.
This is far less than KKR's peak returns of 60% a year or
better in the mid-1980s, though still well above the average
annual stock-market return of 9% to 12%.
   The equity infusion also will shrink KKR's untapped equity
in its buy-out fund to less than $2 billion. Currently, most
buy-out specialists' spending power is about four times their
available equity, meaning that KKR couldn't make more than $8
billion of acquisitions before it would need to raise a new
equity fund.
   The new $8 billion spending ceiling is the least of KKR's
worries, though; the market for big buy-outs is practically
dead this year, anyway.

   Japan's GNP
   Expanded 2.5%
   In 4th Period

   Rise Was Paced by Exports,
   But Officials Downplay
   External Demand's Role

   TOKYO -- Japan's gross national product surged an
inflation-adjusted 2.5% in the nation's fiscal fourth
quarter, ended March 31, led by a sharp increase in exports.
   The quarter-to-quarter increase amounted to a strong 10.4%
at an annual rate. In the fiscal year as a whole, Japan's GNP
grew 5%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This economy's got an enormous head of steam," said
Kenneth Courtis, senior economist in Tokyo for DB Capital
Markets (Asia) Ltd.
   An official at the Economic Planning Agency, which
announced the figures, downplayed the export increase as
reflecting special year-end factors. But the report could
nonetheless spark fears in the U.S. that Japan's external
surpluses may be on the rise again. The most recent quarter
marked the first time since the last quarter of 1984 that
external demand contributed more to Japan's GNP growth than
domestic demand.
   "The decline in the {Japanese} surplus probably touched
bottom in the fourth calendar quarter of 1989," Mr. Courtis
said.
   In the latest quarter, Japan's exports grew 8.5% from the
previous quarter, while imports edged up 2.1%.
   The external sector's contribution to growth for the
quarter was 1.3%, while domestic demand grew 1.2%.
   The Economic Planning Agency official said that for all of
fiscal 1990, domestic demand contributed 5.7% to the growth
figures, while external demand weighed in with a negative
0.7%.
   When sharp fluctuations over the year are averaged, the
official said, it can still be said that Japan's economic
expansion, now in its 43rd month, continues to be led by
domestic demand.
   But, Mr. Courtis said, the yen is 35% cheaper than a year
ago against European currencies. Moreover, economic growth
throughout Asia -- now as important a market for Japan as the
U.S. -- has been faster than expected. "Japan has very
attractive export opportunities into east Asia," Mr. Courtis
said. "Europe is booming. Asia is booming. The slowdown of
the U.S. economy will have less effect than in the past."
   The Japanese agency official said the results for the
fiscal fourth quarter show that the instability that Japanese
markets were experiencing at that time had little impact on
the economy.
   From January through March, Japanese stock and bond prices
dropped sharply, with the Nikkei stock index falling from a
high of 38915.87 on Dec. 29 to 29980.45 by March 30. At the
same time, the yen weakened to an exchange rate of 157.65 to
the dollar from 143.40 to the dollar.
   Personal consumption and private capital expenditures, the
main pillars supporting Japan's current expansion, continued
to grow, though at a less rapid pace than in the previous two
quarters.
   Personal consumption rose a slight 0.5% from the previous
quarter, after a 1.6% rise in the October-December quarter
and a 2% advance in the July-September quarter.
   Chiharu Sumita, an economist with UBS Philips &amp; Drew in
Tokyo, said the slower growth in consumption and in capital
investment reflects a drop in the recent sharp pace of
economic growth.
   But the Economic Planning Agency official said capital
spending remains strong, reflecting increased expenditures
for research and development and the need to cope with an
increasingly serious labor shortage.

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices rebounded slightly from Monday's
sharp drop, again on light volume, while bond prices drifted
lower. The dollar weakened against most major currencies.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.38 points to
2893.56. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell about a
quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each $1,000 of face amount,
in light trading. The dollar fell against the mark and the
yen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some analysts speculated that the dollar's weakness was
partly responsible for bond prices not reacting to a report
of yet another decline in housing starts this past month --
further evidence of a sluggish economy -- and declining
prices for oil and other commodities. Bonds also were held
down by a deluge of newly issued municipal and asset-backed
bonds.
   The drop in bond prices -- along with more disappointing
earnings news and growing conviction that the Federal Reserve
Board isn't about to ease interest rates -- helped to hold
stock prices to modest gains in tepid trading.
   "This is just a reflex rally" following Monday 50-point
drop, said Edward Nicoski, technical research chief at Piper,
Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in Minneapolis. He noted the gains were
confined to blue chips and that the over-the-counter market
fell.
   What hurt the dollar is less clear. It has been trading in
narrow ranges recently in the absence of any startling
economic news. Most of the reports showing weakening economic
activity have been in line with expectations, which leaves
currency traders with little to trade on.
   Richard Levine, a Merrill Lynch foreign-exchange broker,
said traders are alternately nudging the dollar up to see
where they encounter resistance and easing it down to
determine support levels. Yesterday, the focus was on the
bottom end. "Having failed to take out the overhead
resistance level, they're now probing to see how far it
should go on the down side," Mr. Levine said.
   Traders in any market, Mr. Levine added, are most fearful
when their market appears to be drifting along, in no hurry
to rise or fall. "A body at rest tends to stay at rest," he
noted. "They don't want that."
   But Lawrence Leuzzi, a managing director at S.G. Warburg
Securities, sees fundamental reasons for some of the dollar's
weakness. The yen rose, he said, because of a report that
Japan's money supply was growing strongly, as did the
nation's output of goods and services in the first period.
The mark was aided by a rise in West German bond yields, he
said.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose in light trading, with 134.9 million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Advancing issues edged out decliners, 788 to 710.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices climbed. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.47%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar eased. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6738 marks and 153.55 yen, compared with
1.6758 marks and 153.66 yen Monday.

   Retailing:
   Woolworth Is Bargaining
   On Return to East Germany

   Woolworth Corp. executives think they've seen the future
-- and it's in East Germany.
   The New York-based retailer, which already operates 286
stores in West Germany, expects to become the first American
company to open general merchandise stores in East Germany,
where it had business before World War II.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We think we'll have a couple of {stores} open before the
end of this year," said Harold Sells, Woolworth's chairman
and chief executive officer, in an interview. "This will give
us a good test of the market," he added, "and enable us to
move rapidly in 1991," perhaps with another eight to 10
stores.
   "East Germany will be our No. 1 priority," Mr. Sells said,
adding that the company also is considering opening Foot
Locker athletic shoe stores and Rubin jewelry stores there,
as it has in West Germany. Woolworth also sees opportunities
in Czechoslovakia and Hungary, but isn't likely to seriously
consider entering those countries for at least a year, the
executive predicted.
   Woolworth, of course, isn't alone in looking behind the
crumbling Iron Curtain. U.S. marketers of everything from
fast food to jeans are attempting to capture the hearts --
and buying potential -- of Eastern Bloc consumers. McDonald's
Corp. and Estee Lauder cosmetics already have opened shops in
the Soviet Union. Bloomingdale's is in talks about opening
two Bloomie's Express airport shops in Moscow. And like
Woolworth, Toys "R" Us Inc. wants to open stores in East
Germany, although Joseph Baczko, president of the company's
international division, says: "There are a number of issues
that are still up in the air. I don't anticipate that
anything will happen in the next 12 months."
   But the fall of the Berlin Wall and next month's monetary
union of East and West Germany hold special significance for
Woolworth. It opened its first German "25 and 50 pfennig"
store -- the equivalent of a 5 and 10 -- under the Woolworth
name in Bremen in 1927. By the 1940s, the company operated
more than 30 stores in what became East Germany and Poland.
But, after World War II, the Communists seized them and
turned them into state-run outlets. Woolworth was never
compensated for its loss.
   The company is pursuing its claim on the properties, but
its store-opening plans don't depend on the outcome. "We're
going to open new stores, regardless of whether we get the
former locations back," Mr. Sells said. "We think it's a very
attractive market."
   It's also a risky one. The East German government itself
is predicting that 15% to 50% of its workers could lose their
jobs as the nation lurches toward capitalism. And many East
Germans are openly fretting about how much their spending
power will lag behind that of their West German cousins.
   Mr. Sells acknowledged that the approximately 16 million
East Germans are in for a tough transition. But, "we think
we're in a better position than any other U.S. retailer," he
said. "The older generation remembers Woolworth. They
recognize Woolworth being a store for value and one they can
afford."
   Woolworth stores in Germany, like those in the U.S., carry
low-priced snacks and household supplies. But they also carry
more apparel at higher prices than Woolworth outlets in the
U.S.
   Mr. Sells said the company is encouraged by the results of
its German stores near the Eastern border. In the euphoric
first week of free travel to the West last November, East
German consumers swamped the 30 or so nearby Woolworth
locations, Mr. Sells noted. They snapped up candy, peanuts,
toiletries and small computers, doubling year-earlier sales
tallies at many of the stores.
   The first wave of shopping was helped by a West German
government handout of roughly $55 for each East German. Even
so, Mr. Sells said sales at the border stores remain strong.
"We've continued very strong double-digit gains almost every
week since then," he said.
   In the current fiscal year, he said he expects sales to
East Germans to boost the West German unit's sales by an
additional 2% or 3%. The West German operation last year rang
up sales of $1.13 billion, or roughly 13% of Woolworth's
total revenue of $8.82 billion.

   Calamity From Kabul to Jalalabad

   It took place far away and long ago, but the drama of
Great Britain's First Afghan War (1839-42) continues to
fascinate. There was a terrible completeness about the
tragedy that made it exemplary and therefore timeless. The
British army of the Indus, a splendidly equipped force of
more than 15,000 troops, seemed to be invincible as it set
out for Afghanistan, but only one of its soldiers survived
the nightmarish retreat from Kabul to Jalalabad to describe
the catastrophe that overtook it.
   The object of the invasion was to depose the Afghan ruler
Dost Mohammed. The governor general of India, Lord Auckland,
ordered the invasion because he was persuaded by his adviser,
Sir William Hay Macnaghten, that Dost Mohammed, if allowed to
remain ruler, might one day strike a deal with expansionist
Russia at Britain's expense. It was an unlikely surmise, but
on the basis of it the British invaded Afghanistan in order
to make it anti-Russian -- and succeeded only in making it
anti-British.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The story of the war is a tale rich in folly, irony and
human weakness, animated by timeless characters one might
well encounter today or tomorrow. Macnaghten, the chief
architect of Lord Auckland's calamitous policy, was a
brilliant, arrogant, opinionated man who committed mistake
after mistake without realizing, let alone admitting it. In
the end, life imitated theater when he walked into a trap.
   Disregarding the advice of his colleagues ("I understand
these things better than you do," he told them), he tried
double-dealing with a triple-dealing Afghan prince. Smug in
his knowledge of native etiquette, Macnaghten obligingly
presented a ceremonial gift to the prince at their meeting: a
handsome pair of pistols. Need any theatergoer or television
viewer be told that when the prince murdered Macnaghten the
following morning, it was with one of those pistols?
   It is with characters such as Macnaghten, with anecdote,
and with exotic local color that John H. Waller principally
concerns himself in his wonderfully entertaining new book,
"Beyond the Khyber Pass: The Road to British Disaster in the
First Afghan War" (Random House, 329 pages, $24.95). Mr.
Waller, who served in the OSS during World War II and in the
Foreign Service thereafter, retired in 1980 after four years
as inspector general of the Central Intelligence Agency. He
knows the Moslem East at firsthand, and his enthusiastic
interest in the more exotic customs of the region is
infectious.
   It is sex that interests him most. He tells us of "illicit
lusts," "debauchery," and of a household-full of "black-eyed
damsels" that one man proposed to give another as a gift; and
of the "wanton spectacle" presented by "scantily clad dancing
girls." He describes harem games in which naked ladies
skidded down slides onto their waiting lord and master. We
hear of rulers who kept 600 or more women; and are told that
the great Sikh monarch Ranjit Singh, who at one time indulged
immoderately in the pleasures that his hundreds of women
afforded him, grew so old and weak that he could only look at
his harem ladies; for sexual activity he was obliged (we are
told) to turn to a 13-year-old boy. And we learn that in
Central Asia, the reason no man but a mullah is allowed to
climb to the top of a minaret is that minarets command a view
of women sunning themselves on the roofs.
   Mr. Waller's high-spirited tale of travel and adventure is
the stuff of which paperback romance novels are made;
unfortunately, so is its style. Attacks are always "vicious"
and beatings "merciless." Advances are "inexorable" and
horrors "unspeakable." Travelers cross "arid" deserts; but is
there a desert that isn't arid? Shown a funeral rite in which
wives and slave girls were burned alive with their master's
corpse, need we be told that the ritual was "cruel" -- surely
readers could have figured that out for themselves?
   Then, too, after all the coy 19th-century language
("maidens," "damsels" and so on) it jars when the
psychobabbling euphemisms of the 20th-century unexpectedly
intrude, as when the relationship of Princess Lieven
(Dorothea von Beckendorff) to Lord Palmerston, who probably
was her lover, is described as "Dorothy had been very close
to him."
   Mr. Waller seems to be more interested in dealing with the
people than with the politics of the First Afghan War, unlike
J.A. Norris (1967), who tried to make sense of Auckland's
otherwise puzz1ing decisions by placing them in the context
of Britain's world policy, or T.A. Heathcoate (1980), to whom
Auckland's murkiness of mind seemed unsurprising in a high
government official. Mr. Waller does not convincingly convey
to readers his theory of what the leaders of British India
thought they were doing when pursuing what looked even then
-- for example, to Alexander Burnes, Britain's man on the
spot in Kabul -- to be a senseless policy. Indeed, when
dealing with politics the author's attention seems to wander;
in all likelihood it is somewhere back there among those
scantily clad dancing girls.

   Flag Measure
   Sent to House,
   May Face Snags

   WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee sent a
proposed constitutional amendment prohibiting flag
desecration to the full House without recommendation,
signaling possible difficulties for the measure in a vote
that could come as early as tomorrow.
   The action surprised some committee members, who had
earlier predicted that the bill would receive a favorable
recommendation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The committee was deadlocked 18-18 in an initial vote to
send the amendment to the floor with a negative
recommendation. A second vote, which would have approved the
amendment, failed 19-17 before the committee approved a
motion by Chairman Jack Brooks (D., Texas) to report the bill
without recommendation. The Brooks motion passed 19-17.
   The House action comes in the wake of the Supreme Court's
June 11 decision striking down the federal flag-protection
law. Co-sponsored by House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R.,
Ill.) and Rep. Sonny Montgomery (D., Miss.), the amendment
says, "The Congress and the States shall have power to
prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United
States."
   To become part of the Constitution, the proposed amendment
needs a two-thirds vote in each house of Congress plus
approval by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said "it will be a
very close vote." Opponents assert that they are within
striking distance of the 146 votes necessary to block the
amendment. Rep. Robert Kastenmeier (D., Wis.), an opponent,
said his side has picked up 10 or 12 votes in the past week.
   The Senate has scheduled a hearing on the amendment for
tomorrow. Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) said there were 54
Senate votes for the amendment, 24 against and 22 undecided,
with most of the undecideds ready to vote against it.
   Democrats on the House committee were eager to bring the
bill to a vote as early as tomorrow. Republicans, sensing
that more time to publicize the issue would create problems
for the Democrats, would like to see a vote next week.
   Much of the debate revolved around enforcement and focused
on a preamble elaborating on the amendment. While the
preamble has no constitutional effect, many lawmakers believe
it would influence legislation by which the amendment would
be enforced.
   The preamble would designate the flag as "a national
symbol of such stature that it must be kept inviolate." The
document says the amendment would prohibit desecration of the
flag, including the display of the flag in a "contemptuous
manner." Physical desecration, according to the preamble,
would include "burning, mutilating, defacing, defiling or
trampling," but wouldn't be limited to those forms of
desecration.
   The committee defeated proposals by Rep. William Hughes
(D., N.J.) that would have limited the definition of
desecration and restricted enforcement of the amendment to
the federal government.
   "We should not permit disparate interpretation by the
states and the hundreds of other jurisdictions around the
country," he said. "We should not allow the 50 states to
establish their own views of the flag of the United States."
Mr. Hughes's amendment on federal enforcement failed by a
vote of 26-10.
   Retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell joined the
opponents of the proposed amendment. Justice Powell, who left
the court in 1987, signed a statement issued by the Emergency
Committee to Defend the First Amendment, opposing "any effort
to restrict the First Amendment" by amending the
Constitution.

group sales fell 2.2% to 18.25 billion marks ($10.89 billion)
from 18.66 billion marks a year earlier.
   The announcement at Bayer's annual meeting confirmed
expectations of falling profits in the West German chemical
industry, following several years of record results. Bayer
said foreign-exchange fluctuations alone reduced its sales by
about one billion marks and also depressed earnings.

   Sign Tire Accord

<LP>
   FRANKFURT -- Continental AG of West Germany, having
already sealed cooperation links with a major East German
tire maker, has now signed a similar pact with
Czechoslovakia's largest tire company for a quick start in
Eastern Europe.
   The state-owned Barum Group has three major plants that
together produce 3.4 million radial tires for passenger cars
and 2.5 million truck tires annually. The Czechoslovak
enterprise, which supplies tires to the domestic Skoda auto
works and other auto producers in Eastern Europe, had 1989
annual sales of about $441 million and employs 10,000
workers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hanover-based Continental, expected to plow fresh
investments into the Barum venture, said it is still
undecided whether the cooperation will be in the form of a
joint venture or a straight equity stake in Barum.
   "It could be anything. It may take six months, but our
goal is to have the framework set in November," said
Continental spokesman Dieter von Herz.
   Although committed to a business link, both sides are
waiting for the passage of legislation by Czechoslovakia's
newly elected parliament that would privatize industry and
allow foreign purchases of domestic companies. Prague's newly
elected democratic government, eager to attract foreign
investment to modernize its sluggish economy, has pledged
quick free-market reforms by autumn.
   Several Western companies have entered into talks with
Czechoslovak companies, but few deals have been signed ahead
of the parliamentary green light.
   Continental didn't wait, said Mr. von Herz, because "Barum
is extremely interesting to us. They have their market, and
the technical status of their plants is remarkably good for
Eastern Europe."
   Continental, the world's fourth-largest tire company, last
month reported net group profit of 227.8 million Deutsche
marks ($135.9 million) on 1989 sales of 8.38 marks billion.
Continental last year produced 50 million passenger car tires
and 8.5 million truck tires.
   A common thread linking the acquisitions also has been
Continental's longstanding business ties with Volkswagen AG,
a major client for its tires. Volkswagen is negotiating with
Skoda for a joint production agreement.
   Continental recently secured an agreement to pursue a
business linkup with East Germany's VEB Reifenkombinat
Fuerstenwalde, which controls five plants producing 8.5
million tires for cars and trucks annually. Continental also
acquired three major makers of other automotive rubber
products in East Germany.
   A major client of the East German tire and rubber groups
has been East German car maker IFA-Kombinats
Personnenkraftwagen, with which Volkswagen signed a joint
production pact earlier this year as part of Volkswagen's 5
billion mark investment program in East Germany.
   While Continental is moving hard into the East, analysts
observe that other international tire producers are hard on
its heels.
   "All the big tire companies are following the auto makers
into the East. Most of them are looking for state-owned firms
that they can pick up and restructure," said Peter Sedlmeier,
an analyst for Bayerische Hypotheken-&amp; Wechsel-Bank AG.

   The Heresy of Cardinal O'Connor
   ----
   By Tom Bethell

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14

<LP>
   Last week the Archbishop of New York, Cardinal John
O'Connor, published a long article in the archdiocesan
newspaper, at one point noting that politicians who
persistently support abortion rights "must be warned that
they are at risk of excommunication." This is a penalty that
does not prevent individuals from considering themselves
Catholic, but it does exclude them from some sacraments,
notably Holy Communion. (The sacrament of confession is
always available to an excommunicated Catholic.)
   Cardinal O'Connor's warning might have been thought merely
routine -- as it would be if the president of a private club
had warned members delinquent on their dues that their
privileges were in jeopardy. But a media ministorm ensued.
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who both supports abortion and
parades his Catholicism, and therefore may risk
excommunication under Cardinal O'Connor's interpretation of
church rules, called an impromptu news conference. "It is
upsetting," he said. "I don't like to hear it. How could you?
This is something very fundamental to our family."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The New York Post splashed Cardinal O'Connor's warning on
its front page and assigned half a dozen reporters to the
story. A Post columnist compared Cardinal O'Connor to the
Ayatollah Khomeini and politicians threatened by his
"inquisition" were compared to the author-in-hiding, Salman
Rushdie. A New York Times editorial asserted that Cardinal
O'Connor's "uncompromising stance punishes Catholics in
public life," and complained that, whereas government can
impose no religious test for public office, "the Cardinal
imposes a religious test of his own."
   By Sunday, at a St. Patrick's Cathedral press conference,
Cardinal O'Connor seemed to be back in the defensive crouch
now expected of church leaders bold enough to give public
emphasis to traditional Catholic teachings. "I have never
threatened to excommunicate anybody," he said, and on the
following day the New York Times had him safely tucked away
on an inside page: "O'Connor Denies Plan to Excommunicate
Anyone."
   To ram the point home (just in case there were
recalcitrant dogmatists still at large) NBC's Today program
gave us an early morning civics lesson on Monday. When John
F. Kennedy became president, correspondent Katherine Couric
reminded us, there were widespread concerns that he might
take orders from Rome. Such church-state worries "persist"
today, Ms. Gouric said, with Cardinal O'Connor's "bold
attempt to discipline politicians."
   Then Mr. Cuomo was on the screen -- in theological
disagreement with the cardinal (but more in sorrow than in
anger). "I wouldn't do it {support abortion}," he said, "if I
thought I was risking my soul." (Indeed, if the governor
knows better than the cardinal on this score, what need do we
have of cardinals?) There followed the usual supporting cast
of dissenters. The Rev. Andrew Greeley in priestly collar was
duly concerned. "This is a dialoguing society," he said.
Frances Kissling, representing Catholics for a Free Choice,
thought the cardinal guilty of "an act of desperation."
   Clearly there was an important principle lurking here, but
no one came right out and said it. What is at stake is the
Catholic Church's right to discipline its flock -- to apply
its own rules to its members. Formally, this right is not
questioned (although once again we have heard some
crowd-pleasing dissent, notably from the Rev. Richard McBrien
of Notre Dame's theology department). But issues of canon law
and constitutional law barely describe the real world that
Cardinal O'Connor finds himself in -- a world in which a
partial press armed with cameras and spotlights can generate
unanticipated public pressure.
   Cardinal O'Connor has been served notice, informally, that
the church membership claims of Catholic politicians who
adopt positions in line with the secular culture should not
be questioned publicly by Catholic Church leaders. Rep.
Charles Rangel of New York characterized such
question-raising as "intemperate, mean-spirited, and in
contempt of Christian and Catholic belief." In particular,
Cardinal O'Connor has been warned that if he excommunicates
politicians without fear or favor, the "church-state" issue
will be raised against him and life will get hot under the
media spotlight.
   Excommunication is not always thought so dangerous. In
1962, when the Archbishop of New Orleans excommunicated a
local segregationist leader, Leander Perez, the New York
Times editorialized: "We salute the Catholic Archbishop. He
has set an example founded on religious principle, and
responsive to the social conscience of our time." Men "of all
faiths must admire" his "unwavering courage." If Cardinal
O'Connor today threatened to excommunicate church members for
racism, he could be sure that no church-state issues would be
raised.
   The pretense that Cardinal O'Connor is imposing a
"religious test" in defiance of the Constitution is absurd.
The constitution says that there shall be no religious test
for public office; not that there shall be no religious test
for religions. It is Mr. Cuomo, not Cardinal O'Connor, who is
the public official armed with the law. Mr. Cuomo manages to
pull off the amazing trick of posing as Thomas More while
being in the position of Henry VIII.
   In one respect church-state issues are real enough. At
about the same time that Cardinal O'Connor was being hauled
before the cameras, Mr. Rangel, a senior member of the Ways
and Means Committee, was reported to have threatened to
question the church's tax-exempt status at his committee. He
was irritated because he had been invited to and then
(because of his pro-abortion position) disinvited from a
Catholic high school graduation. If, as a result of such
pressure, the church shrinks from applying its own rules to
politicians, there is a real and dangerous encroachment upon
the church by the state.
   Cardinal O'Connor (and anyone rash enough to follow in his
footsteps) is under extra-legal media and political pressure
to turn a blind eye when church members expediently align
themselves with the secular culture. The Catholic Church may
be a private institution, some politicians and their media
allies are obliquely saying, but it's too important an
institution to be left solely in the hands of clergymen. The
church should, therefore, uncomplainingly permit itself to be
colonized by internal dissenters.
   Why are liberal politicians such as Mr. Cuomo so eager to
claim membership in an organization whose rules they disagree
with, especially when, as we are given to suppose (and as may
well be the case), these rules are unpopular with the voters?
One answer is that the politicians probably don't think of
these rules as being made by God. They think of them as man
made. And men are amenable to political pressure. The rules
can, therefore be changed -- brought into line with
contemporary liberal opinion.
   Mr. Cuomo and his supporters have some reason for thinking
along these lines. If church law is God's law, and if
abortion-supporting politicians deserve excommunication now,
they have deserved it all along. But for 17 years U.S.
bishops have said little to encourage this line of thought.
This protracted episcopal silence has permitted Cardinal
O'Connor's opponents to construe his recent remarks as
arbitrary. If the rule had been enforced all along, maybe the
church would be a smaller institution today, but it would
also be a more self-assured one.

   But the Soviet president assailed those who want to make

   The Judiciary Committee sent the proposed constitutional
amendment protecting the flag to the full House without
recommendation, signaling possible difficulties for the

The 19-17 vote surprised some panel members, who had

a law banning flag desecration, saying it violated freedom of
speech.
   The amendment would have to be passed by a two-thirds
majority in Congress and then approved by legislatures in at

   Nobody's Crying Yet, but There
   Must Be Spilled Milk Somewhere

   Suddenly, the problem isn't what's in the Perrier but what
the Perrier is in.
   The latest twist in the much publicized Perrier recall
last February is a controversy over milk crates -- lots of
them -- into which retailers hastily dumped bottles of the
suspect French mineral water.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The disappearance of thousands of milk crates was first
noticed by deliverymen working for Farmland Dairy,
Wallington, N.J., the state's second-biggest dairy.
Farmland's president, Marc Goldman, sent out sleuths who
traced the missing containers to an Elizabeth, N.J.,
warehouse he says is filled with discarded bottles of
designer water. It seems retailers -- faced with recall
orders after traces of benzene, a carcinogen, were found in
the bubbly water -- had simply tossed the green bottles into
any available receptacles, including empty fruit, cornflake
and tampon cases -- and plastic milk crates.
   The discovery of the missing crates raised Mr. Goldman's
ire. Last month, he brought criminal charges against the
Elizabeth warehouse, Distribution Warehouse &amp; Service Corp.,
and a Newark, N.J., recycler, REI Distributors, alleging
illegal possession of milk crates.
   Mr. Goldman, his good nature already sorely tested by more
commonplace milkcrate miscreants, fumes that Farmland will
have to replace as many as 50,000 of its approximately
175,000 crates, whose cost of about $3 each is passed along
to consumers.
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. unit of Source Perrier S.A.
denies any malicious intent. The recall started suddenly on a
Friday night, she explains, and "everybody was just
scrambling to do the best they could."
   Robert Kortenhaus, a vice president at the warehouse, says
he's got Perrier stored in crates from about 24 Northeastern
dairies and he's trying to return the crates as fast as he
can. Getting permits to dispose of the water took time, he
says. "You can't just dump large amounts of Perrier into the
Newark sewer system."
   Joe Mastriano, the official named in Farmland's complaint
against the recycler, thinks he's being blamed because Mr.
Goldman is afraid to confront the real culprits: his own
customers. "It would be the same as if someone had stolen a
car and dropped it off on your property," Mr. Mastriano says.
He is understandably pretty sour about the whole affair. If
convicted under New Jersey's Milk Case Recovery Act, he could
face 30 days in jail.

   A STORY on page B1 of yesterday's edition incorrectly
reported that Distribution Warehouse &amp; Service Corp. and REI
Distributors were named in criminal complaints brought by an
individual alleging the misuse of milk crates. Neither
company was named in the complaints, and neither has been
accused of any illegality. The complaints name an individual
at each company, but not the company itself.

   PLANNING BEGINS for a White House Conference on Small
Business in 1994.
   Legislation calling for the conference, a sort of national
summit meeting on small-business issues, is in the early
stages of congressional action. Barring unforeseen problems,
lawmakers could send a bill to President Bush by late summer.
The administration and entrepreneurs back the idea. "We think
it's time for the White House to take the temperature of the
small-business community," says John Paul Galles, executive
vice president of National Small Business United, an advocacy
group.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   White House conferences in 1980 and 1986 put the spotlight
on problems facing small companies and led to regulatory
reform, a paper-work reduction law, improved access to
government contracts and other measures favorable to small
business. They also educated a lot of small-company
executives on the political facts of life. "You have a whole
new cadre of business people at the state level who are
awakened to the legislative process," says Donna Nickerson,
government-relations director for the Northeastern Retail
Lumber Association in Rochester, N.Y., and a delegate to the
1980 conference.
   State and regional meetings would be held starting in 1992
to submit resolutions and elect delegates to the Washington
conference.

   SENATORS PROBE more losses at small-business investment
companies.
   At a Senate Small Business Committee hearing this week,
the Small Business Administration's inspector general is
expected to report that a recent review of the SBA's licensed
investment firms shows another 14 are on shaky ground. The
failure of these SBICs could cost the government up to $170
million, in addition to the more than $560 million already in
default because of past failures. Small-business investment
companies are SBA-sponsored venture-capital concerns. Though
they have contributed to such huge successes as Apple
Computer Corp. and Cray Research Inc., some also have been
magnets for corruption.
   Arkansas Democrat Sen. Dale Bumpers, the committee's
chairman, has suggested the SBA stop licensing new SBICs
until the program is under control. He has scheduled two more
hearings for July. The current crisis came to light after the
1988 collapse of River Capital Corp., costing the agency $32
million. As previously reported, Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., which
audited the firm in 1987, is under scrutiny for failing to
detect its problems. SBA Administrator Susan Engeleiter has
promised better analysis of SBIC investments and closer
checks of applicants' financial and managerial backgrounds.
   Solvent SBICs and minority-owned investment firms fear a
fallout. After gains by minority firms, "the timing couldn't
be worse for us," says Jo An Price, president of the National
Association of Investment Cos.

   CIVIL RIGHTS CONCERN: Small business presses to ease a
provision of the pending civil rights bill that would permit
punitive damages against companies found guilty of
intentional employment discrimination. Small firms fear that
the possibility of high damage awards would lead to more
costly out-of-court settlements as businesses weigh their
potential losses if they go to trial. "Revising the damages
provision would move us in the right direction," says John
Satagaj, president of the Small Business Legislative Council.

   VENTURE POLITICS: Contrary to the usual focus on safe
incumbents, PrintPAC, the political-action committee of the
Printing Industries of America, says 50% of its contributions
will go to challengers and open-seat races for the U.S. House
and Senate this year. "Advantages to incumbents are so
overwhelming that we feel we don't need to add to that
advantage," says PrintPAC Treasurer Benjamin Cooper. "The
contributors to PrintPAC are entrepreneurs. Our PAC strategy
ought to follow that philosophy."

   MANDATED LEAVE still bothers small business despite an
expected Bush veto.
   Before the Senate last Thursday joined the House in
passing a bill to require companies to grant unpaid leave to
employees for childbirth, adoption or serious family
illnesses, the White House gave small businesses new
assurances that President Bush would veto the measure. Even
though the bill exempts small employers, small-business
groups fear that it would open the door to various
mandated-employee benefits by all employers. The
mandated-benefits issue has become a litmus test for
small-business interests in Congress this year.
   The White House expects the House and Senate will sustain
Mr. Bush's veto of the employee-leave legislation. But the
bill's Democratic sponsors will get political mileage out of
the issue by saying a veto is contrary to the president's
family-values themes, small-business groups predict. And
small business could well have to face the issue again next
year, concedes John Motley, chief lobbyist for the National
Federation of Independent Business, the largest
small-business organization.
   The goal now, Mr. Motley says: to sustain a veto with so
many votes that the sponsors won't come back next year,
"unless they're masochists."

   SMALL TALK: The No. 1 reason about 20% of discharged
managers now become entrepreneurs? To avoid the trauma of
another discharge, says a survey by consultants Challenger,
Gray &amp; Christman. . . . A "my favorite bureaucrat contest" is
won by Richard McKinney, an employee of a Small Business
Development Center at Walters State Community College in
Tennessee; he helped a small manufacturer double sales by
working nights, without payment, to help fill company orders.

   MUST STATES REFUND $2 billion they don't have to
federal-government retirees?
   In March 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court said Michigan had
taxed pensions of federal retirees unconstitutionally while
exempting those of state retirees -- but the court didn't say
whether the tax treatment must be equalized retroactively by
refunds or other action. So the 27 states potentially
affected waited to see the outcome of two cases involving
refunds of other unconstitutional state taxes. Two weeks ago,
the justices reached differing decisions in the two cases,
transmitting an ambiguous message to the states resisting
pension-tax refunds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The court has agreed to review another similar case, but
lawyers aren't sure that case can produce a definitive
ruling. Certainty may have to wait for refund suits to work
through state courts to the high court. South Carolina's
Supreme Court has rejected refunds; Missouri's has upheld
them. But New Mexico has just decided the U.S. Supreme Court
hasn't provided grounds for appealing a trial court's award
of refunds.
   Trial courts have granted refunds in four other states,
denied them in one.
                                                                                                       

   STATES FIND IT COSTLY to equalize taxes on federal and
state pensions.
   Refunds of past taxes still are at issue, but states
clearly had to equalize future taxes; 21 have done so. The
Federation of Tax Administrators, a state officials' group,
estimated that outright equalization could cut states'
revenue by $500 million a year; compromises have trimmed that
to $90 million. Four states have exempted federal pensions
fully, but 11 opted to end full exemption for state pensions
and to grant partial exemption to all government retirees.
   Three states increased state pensions to offset taxes
somewhat. But two others, New Mexico and Utah, dropped
state-retiree exemptions and now tax all retirement benefits.
Six generous states extended at least partial exemption to
all pensioners -- private and government. But one, Virginia,
cut back its exemptions this year after projecting that
revenue losses from its 1989 legislation would exceed $100
million in 1991; the projected loss now is about $60 million.
                                                                                                       

   IRS CRIME FIGHTERS will consider where to aim their
resources in the '90s.
   Half these resources long have gone into multi-agency
projects to nail organized-crime and drug figures; those
programs now include thrift-institution fraud. But total
resources have held steady at about 2,800 agents. The IRS and
others have questioned whether a larger share of them should
be investigating general tax crimes. In 1988, Congress's
General Accounting Office said IRS criminal enforcement
couldn't be evaluated because it didn't have specific goals.
   Now the IRS, the Treasury and the Justice Department are
forming a task force to study the allocation of these
resources. The group will meet for the first time late in
July to formulate purposes and methods. "We need a
broad-based study," says Assistant IRS Commissioner Morics.
In fiscal 1989, the IRS began 5,417 criminal inquiries, up
from 4,899 in 1988. Half the new cases, 2,709, involved drugs
and money-laundering, up from 1,430 in 1988.
   The group will seek comments from practitioners and
others, Morics says.
                                                                                                       

   HE NEVER LOST when he gambled, said Jerold Dean Kling of
Scottsbluff, Neb.; that's how he supported simultaneously his
wife and three children and his girlfriend and her children.
But the Tax Court agreed with the IRS that Kling embezzled a
taxable $95,000 in two years from the tire shop where he was
the manager.
                                                                                                       

   GENEROUS FOLKS often use charitable remainder trusts: They
set aside assets to go to charity when they die, but retain
trust income for their lifetimes. Now Revenue Procedures
90-30 through 90-33 describe 16 trust types that meet IRS
requirements; the IRS no longer will provide private rulings
on whether other forms qualify.
                                                                                                       

   VIRGINIA LANDLORDS can earn personal or corporate state
tax credits for 1991 through 1993 by reducing rents by at
least 15% for tenants who are disabled or over 62. The credit
will equal 50% of the reductions; the annual maximum will be
the lesser of $10,000 or the income tax due.
                                                                                                       

   TOUGHER TOOLS for collecting debts are sought by the 93
U.S. attorneys.
   These Justice Department officials say they are hampered
in collecting federal tax, loan and other delinquencies
because federal-court rules require them to operate under the
divergent collection laws of the states where they are
located. For example, says U.S. Attorney Wortham of Tyler,
Texas, five states don't permit garnishment of wages. Also,
he says, debtors in Texas and Florida can protect homesteads
"worth millions" from seizure, yet those in Idaho have no
homestead protection at all.
   The U.S. attorneys want to create uniform federal
collection rules to bypass the weaknesses in state laws. The
Senate adopted their bill last November. But at a House
Judiciary hearing last week, Robert Hobbs of the National
Consumer Law Center and Henry Sommer of Community Legal
Services of Philadelphia said many of the bill's measures are
far too harsh.
   Its garnishments could put families below the poverty
line, Hobbs said.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: The Senate Finance Committee plans a hearing June
27 on proposals to ease restrictions on "estate freezes" that
are used to hold down estate taxes when business ownership is
transferred within a family. . . . The House Ways and Means
Committee's 1,300-page compilation of tax-simplification
proposals is now available.

   CUSTOMERS may not like it, but more software makers are
installing 900 numbers to make users pay for advice.
   "The idea seems to be catching on," says Jeffrey Tarter,
editor of SoftLetter, a Watertown, Mass., newsletter.
   Phone support has been a bone of contention between
customers and software makers for years. The companies say
answering questions is time-consuming and costly. Customers
say they have to call because software and instructions are
incomprehensible.
   The software makers, which have started charging $1 to $2
a minute, justify the fees by saying they pay for
improvements in service. Buttonware Inc., a Bellevue, Wash.,
maker of PC File, a $129 database, says it has doubled the
number of advisers since beginning a $1-a-minute 900 line.
"We thought we'd get roasted," says a spokeswoman. "But we
found that people are willing to pay. They just want the
help."
   Industry giant Microsoft Inc. has installed a 900 line to
help people with questions about MS-DOS, the operating
systems it designed but sells through other companies. In the
past, it didn't provide much help to puzzled DOS users, nor
did anyone else, customers say. Lotus Development Corp.,
maker of best-selling spreadsheet 1-2-3, and Aldus Corp.,
maker of the desktop publishing program PageMaker, are also
trying out 900 numbers.
   Russ Walter, a computer-book author in Somerville, Mass.,
who answers phone queries for free, says, "I'd hate to see it
become the norm." After all, he says, "one marketing pitch is
that they support their customers." Another problem: Many
companies have switchboards that block users from dialing 900
numbers.
                                                                                                       

   Checking Photo I.D.s
   On a Computer Screen

   INVENTORS have struggled for years to meld computers with
security systems.
   Various companies already have marketed electronic devices
that check identities by examining eyes or by sensing the
speed and pressure with which people write their names.
   Now, Sacody Technologies Inc., New York, has developed a
straightforward system that lets clerks or security guards
call up stored photos and signatures on a three-inch screen.
Because pictures of authorized customers or employees are
stored on a disk, crooks can't get by with forged
identification cards.
   Sacody has devised a way to compress identification
photographs to 5,000 bytes of information, allowing storage
of 5,000 photos on a 30-megabyte personal-computer disk.
Without compression, a photo takes about 50,000 bytes. The
amount of data is small enough so the information can be sent
from a disk to a Sacody terminal in six seconds on a
local-area network or 15 seconds over a regular phone line.
   One early user, Turtle Cove Golf Club, a New York driving
range, says the system helps workers confirm that a golfer
has credit in his account before handing out a bucket of
balls.
                                                                                                       

   MIPS Keeps Slipping
   As a Speed Standard
                                                                                                       

   THE COMMON measure of computer speed, MIPS, is an acronym
for millions of instructions per second, but cynical
customers joke that it means meaningless indicator of
processor speed or even marketing instructions for pushy
salespeople.
   Now, a new suite of measurements called SPEC, which is
being used widely by makers of engineering workstations,
makes clear just how meaningless MIPS can be. The 10 SPEC
benchmark programs were designed to provide consistent speed
comparisons among computers doing various types of jobs.
   John R. Mashey, a vice president at MIPS Computer Systems
Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif., workstation maker, recently
compared vendors' MIPS speed claims with their reported SPEC
performance numbers. It turns out the customers have a right
to be cynical. While Mr. Mashey says the vendors had
legitimate reasons for their MIPS claims, the ratings could
badly mislead customers.
   In the study, Mr. Mashey concludes that one of his
company's workstations rated at 20 MIPS "shows similar
performance on integer programs" to an International Business
Machines Corp. RS/6000 rated at 34.5 MIPS and is twice as
fast as a Sun Microsystems Inc. 12.5 MIPS workstation. A
Digital Equipment Corp. VAX workstation's SPEC performance
translates into about 90% of its claimed MIPS, but a Digital
RISC workstation is about 83%.
   Overall, Mr. Mashey says that actual performance as
measured by SPEC ranges from 54% to 96% of companies' MIPS
claims. In floating-point operations, which reflect
scientific performance, differences range from 34% to 135%.
"There is no such thing as a MIPS rating that means much," he
concludes.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   JAPANESE companies invested a record $320 million in small
U.S. technology companies last year, says Venture Economics
Inc., a Wellesley, Mass., research firm. Even without the
$100 million investment by Canon Inc. in Stephen Jobs's Next
Inc., that was 25% higher than the $176 million recorded in
1988. . . . Philip Emeagwali, a Nigerian graduate student at
the University of Michigan, won the Gordon Bell Prize for
last year's most cost-effective supercomputer program, a
simulation of an underground oil reservoir that he wrote for
the Connection Machine, a computer with 65,000
microprocessors connected together. The fastest conventional
supercomputers link eight very powerful processors. Mr.
Emeagwali compares big processors to oxen and small ones to
chickens: "If the chickens coordinate their efforts, they'll
do a better job."

   Seeks NBC

   NEW YORK -- Cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. is taking
the unusual step of proposing that its cable systems become
affiliates of National Broadcasting Co.'s top-rated NBC
network in rural cities not served by broadcasters.
   John Malone, president of Tele-Communications, made the
proposal in a two-page letter to NBC President Robert C.
Wright. Mr. Wright couldn't be reached for comment, and NBC
officials said they haven't seen the letter, but they
indicated that the General Electric Co. unit wouldn't be
receptive to cable concern's overture.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposal is also likely to infuriate the more than 200
broadcast TV stations that make up NBC's affiliate network.
"I can see no circumstance where such an arrangement would be
attractive or acceptable to any NBC affiliate," said the
affiliate board chairman, Eric Bremner, who heads
broadcasting operations at KING Broadcasting Co.
   The proposal is a fairly radical one in an industry where
cable systems have never had any relationship with the three
networks other than to provide reception for the local
broadcast affiliate. A cable system has never served as the
direct carrier of network TV programs.
   The timing of the proposal isn't accidental, said
Tele-Communications Vice-President Robert Thomson. NBC is
lobbying Capitol Hill to pass federal legislation that would
prohibit cable companies from signing exclusive agreements
with cable networks.
   Currently, a cable network signs a contract that gives
cable systems the right to broadcast the network in assigned
areas. For example, two cable companies in the Seattle region
have the right to broadcast TNT, the all-movie cable channel
owned by Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
   NBC, which plans to operate a direct-to-home satellite TV
business dubbed Sky Cable with three partners by the end of
1993, wants the right to carry cable channels on its new
system, including those with existing exclusive distribution
agreements.
   Tele-Communications stressed, however, that it isn't
looking to compete with NBC affiliates. In his letter, Mr.
Malone asked for permission "to receive for retransmission on
its cable systems a direct network feed of all NBC network
programming in all its cable systems that do not have an
existing local network affiliate."
   For example, Tele-Communications operates a cable system
in Carson City, Nev., which has no local NBC affiliate.
TeleCommunications retransmits a distant signal from the Reno
NBC affiliate, which provides no local programming or news
about Carson City. But even if Tele-Communications became the
Carson City affiliate, it would continue to carry the Reno
NBC station, according to Tele-Communications' Mr. Thomson.
   Mr. Thomson said in a telephone interview that there are
"hundreds" of such cities that do not have local programming.
And in his letter to NBC's Mr. Wright, Mr. Malone said, "I
believe that TCI and NBC can work together to . . . provide
hometown television programming for a number of rural
communities across the United States which do not have it
now."
   Tele-Communications' Mr. Thomson said his company
approached NBC because "it is the most effective and most
popular programmer in the world, and they have indicated they
are cable-friendly." Of the three major broadcast networks,
NBC has been the most aggressive in pursuing cable
opportunities. Two years ago, it formed a programming joint
venture with Cablevision Systems Corp. to produce a wide
variety of entertainmnent, news and sports programming for
cable systems.
   Among the program ventures with Cablevision is the
Consumer News and Business Channel, or CNBC, which is
received by 16 million cable subscribers. NBC and Cablevision
also formed a joint venture earlier this year with News Corp.
and Hughes Communications, a unit of General Motors Corp., to
launch the direct-to-home satellite TV service, Sky Cable.
   But a move such as that proposed by Tele-Communications
could put NBC at loggerheads with its affiliates. Even if
Tele-Communications promises to continue to carry affiliates
that are currently imported from distant cities, affiliates
worry that the cable company will eventually drop that NBC
affiliate. In recent years, cable companies have been allowed
by law to drop any station that duplicates programming
provided by another, such as a distant-city affiliate of a
network.
   In his letter, Mr. Malone addressed that concern, saying
that "NBC network programming might conceivably appear on
more than one cable channel." He also said that his company
"would relinquish its `affiliate status,' following proper
notice and subject to certain conditions, in any community
where a new or existing broadcaster within the community was
selected as an NBC broadcast affiliate."
   Moreover, he said that while his company would carry NBC
on the same terms and conditions as those of NBC's broadcast
affiliates, Tele-Communications wouldn't ask NBC for
affiliate payments.
   But Mr. Malone added that any agreement with NBC would
have to be "phased in over time as NBC's existing, regionally
exclusive affiliation agreements lapse." Such agreements must
be renewed every two to three years, and affiliates worry
that NBC might not renew such pacts if a cable system becomes
an affiliate -- particularly if the cable system doesn't
charge the network for carrying it.
   NBC stressed it won't make any moves that might harm
affiliates. "We would not do anything that was not
advantageous to our affiliates," said an NBC spokesman.
   In his letter to Mr. Wright, Mr. Malone noted that many
rural cities and towns don't receive any local news, because
they are reliant on stations imported from other cities,
"which are naturally inclined to give events happening in
their city of license overwhelming priority." Such
communities "would be better served if they had their own
local NBC broadcast affiliates, but the economic reality is
that smaller communities often cannot support a broadcast
television station, let alone a full service broadcast
network affiliate."
   For cable, Mr. Malone noted, "the economics are
different." Cable systems get revenue from both advertisers
and subscriber fees, and "we have a growing ad sales capacity
even in our smallest service areas," he said.

the Sierra Club and the Audubon Society. Some are more pushy
than others; some are less willing to accommodate alternative
uses of public lands. But all are committed to the democratic
process.
   Today, however, an increasing number of environmental
activists are unwilling to compromise, despite their past
successes. Instead, they are taking the advice of Dave
Foreman, founder of Earth First], who recently urged the
readers of Mother Jones to commit civil disobedience: "You
know what you can do. Do it."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Once that would have meant the sort of disruptive but
nonviolent protests that Earth First] is scheduled to begin
today as part of a summer-long campaign to halt timbering in
northern California. However, despite their protestations to
the contrary, some may be moving toward violent activities.
Late last month two Earth First] activists were arrested in
Oakland after a pipe bomb in their car exploded; both have
been active in anti-logging activities and are being
investigated in connection with the bombing of a nearby
lumber mill earlier in the month. (They deny knowledge of the
bomb and claim someone was trying to assassinate them.) Mr.
Foreman is facing trial, along with three others, for
allegedly conspiring to down several electrical transmission
towers.
   Ecoterrorism first gained notoriety in the early 1970s,
when a lone environmental activist, "the Fox," engaged in a
sustained campaign of eco-sabotage, or ecotage, against
Chicago-area firms. The late Edward Abbey romanticized
ecoterrorism in his 1975 novel, "The Monkey Wrench Gang," in
which four people roam the West wreaking unimaginable havoc.
Mr. Abbey became a spiritual adviser to radical
environmentalists: "If opposition is not enough, we must
resist. And if resistance is not enough, then subvert," he
said.
   Nevertheless, there was no formal structure for ecoteurs
until 1981, when Mr. Foreman, a former lobbyist for the
Wilderness Society, created Earth First]. Although the
organization does not formally engage in ecotage, Mr. Foreman
conceded shortly after its formation that it was intended "to
inspire others to carry out activities straight from the
pages of `The Monkey Wrench Gang.'" Mr. Foreman has also
written two editions of "Ecodefense: A Field Guide to
Monkeywrenching," which offers detailed advice on how to
drive spikes into trees to shatter chain saws and sawmill
blades; scatter caltrops on roads to flatten tires; disable
construction equipment; pull up mining markers and survey
stakes; and fell powerlines, which, explains Mr. Foreman,
"are highly vulnerable to monkeywrenching from individuals or
small groups."
   Last year the Mountain States Legal Foundation established
an ecotage hotline, which recorded sabotage in California,
Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Tree spiking
-- which almost killed a mill worker struck by a shattered
saw blade in 1987 -- seems relatively common in the
Northwest. So is sabotage against construction and timbering
equipment. A cross-country motor-cross race was halted when
garroting wire was strung at neck level. Ski lifts have been
vandalized, and other examples abound. Public officials play
down the importance of ecoterrorism, but Mr. Foreman argues
that they are trying "to keep it quiet" because reporting
such activities "would only encourage similar acts by many
more of the millions of Americans who are strongly against
the rape of what's left of our wilderness."
   Of course, not everyone who is outraged over, say,
government-subsidized timbering, which is both
environmentally destructive and financially wasteful, engages
in ecotage. Underlying the activities of many ecoteurs is the
philosophy of "Deep Ecology," which places the preservation
of nature above the promotion of humankind. In a sense it is
a move back to pantheism, with the belief that nature is
sacred. Mr. Foreman, for one, has attacked the
"anthropocentric" philosophy of the West, arguing that the
"wilderness has a right to exist for its own sake." He views
monkeywrenching as "a form of worship toward the earth. It's
really a very spiritual thing to go out and do."
   Adequate legal penalties are a necessary part of any
effort to combat ecoterrorism. Yet Western forest and range
lands are too sparsely populated to be well defended against
determined ecoterrorists. The best response is more subtle --
environmentalist, community, business and political leaders
need to reinforce the basic belief, held by most
environmentalists, that violence is not justified as a means
of overturning defeats in the political arena, and that the
protection of human life remains people's paramount
responsibility.
   Particularly important is the role of environmental
groups. Since they are committed to many of the same goals as
Earth First], they have a special duty to discourage violence
in the name of the environment (as has Natural Resources
Defense Council attorney Robert Kennedy, for example).
   Moreover, pork-minded legislators need to abandon the sort
of spendthrift and ruinous management policies that have
rightly angered many environmentalists. Land should be
privatized and subsidies ended. That abuses exist is no
excuse for violence, but reforming current policy would
reduce people's incentive to violate the law.
   With groups apparently prepared to bomb sawmills, down
electrical towers, and decapitate cyclists -- and ads being
placed for terminally ill volunteers to launch kamikaze
attacks on dams -- ecoterrorism can no longer be dismissed as
minor. We risk the development of an ecological guerrilla
movement, one ready even to kill, unless all participants in
the political process reaffirm the importance of both
nonviolence and human life.

   Motorola Is Expected to Unveil Plans
   For Satellite System for Cellular Phones

   Motorola Inc. is expected to unveil plans next week for a
new satellite communications system that some industry
experts believe could handle cellular phone calls within a
few years.
   Such a move by the Schaumburg, Ill., electronics and
semiconductor company would greatly expand cellular telephone
coverage, which currently excludes rural areas without
ground-based switching systems.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're talking about a major change in the technology,"
said John Pemberton, a mobile communications analyst at
Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn., research firm.
   Mr. Pemberton said he believes Motorola plans a "hybrid"
system that would use both the ground-based system and what
he calls the "sky system." As the user left an area covered
by the ground system, the satellite system would take over.
   A Motorola spokesman said the company plans to announce
Tuesday a "global communications system." He wouldn't
elaborate, except to say that the announcement will be made
at New York's Hayden Planetarium.
   Space News, a trade publication in Springfield, Va.,
reported in its June 4-10 edition that industry officials
told it that Motorola "intends to launch a constellation of
dozens of small satellites that would expand vastly its
ability to provide continuous mobile telephone service" in
the U.S. and abroad.
   Mr. Pemberton of Gartner Group said he expects Motorola to
eventually launch as many as 60 to 70 small satellites over a
number of years beginning as early as 1992, at a potential
cost of $1 billion. He said 15 to 22 satellites would be
enough to get full coverage of the U.S., and additional ones
could be used to expand capacity.
   The Motorola spokesman said some of the information in the
Space News story was incorrect. He also said numbers
describing the size of the communications system have been
wrong, but wouldn't elaborate further.
   Besides catapulting Motorola into a business dominated by
phone companies, a move into satellite transmission of
cellular calls could lead to new equipment sales for
Motorola. Blanketing the U.S. or other nations with coverage
would open markets not currently served by cellular systems.
   Motorola already is the world's biggest supplier of
cellular phone systems and mobile and portable phones. It
cites analysts' predictions that the world cellular market
will jump to 100 million subscribers by the year 2000 from
about 7 million last year.
   Thomas Kurlak, who follows the company for Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., says Motorola now derives 55% of its operating income
from its cellular businesses. Mr. Kurlak said a move by
Motorola into satellite communications could make it "a new,
massive provider" of telephone service over the next 10 to 20
years.
   Analysts said Motorola could seek partners to help finance
such an effort. Because they could otherwise lose business to
a satellite system, analysts said the "Baby Bell" regional
phone companies would be ideal candidates for such a
partnership.
   Dow Jones Professional Investors Report said yesterday
that speculation of a possible launch services contract from
Motorola was behind recent surge in the stock of Orbital
Sciences Corp., It said Orbital wouldn't comment.

   NEW YORK -- Two top executives at Reader's Digest
Association Inc. recently sold large chunks of their holdings
in the Pleasantville, N.Y., publishing company, according to
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Richard F. McLoughlin, the company's president, sold 81%
of his stock last month, receiving $4.1 million for the
175,000 shares he sold, according to the filings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kenneth O. Gilmore, editor in chief of Reader's Digest
magazine and a company director, sold 72,000 Class A common
shares for about $1.9 million, representing 45% of his
holdings, according to the filings.
   Both men declined to comment. But Bruce Trachtenberg, a
spokesman for the company, said Mr. McLoughlin's sale was
related to the president's approaching retirement June 30.
According to SEC filings, Mr. McLoughlin retains 40,160 Class
A common shares and 60 shares of the company's preferred
stock.
   The company went public Feb. 15 in an offering priced at
$20 a share. At the time, the stock that the two officials
had accumulated were converted to public shares.
   Mr. McLoughlin sold his shares May 15 at an average price
of $23.64 a share, while Mr. Gilmore's shares, sold on May
31, fetched an average of $26.13 a share. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, Reader's Digest stock closed at
$25.375, down 25 cents.

   BLOCK SELLERS: In several sales in late April and May,
four insiders at Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., a large
video-rental chain, sold a total of 289,200 shares, SEC
filings show.
   The bulk of the shares were sold by Vice President Jeffrey
Shearer. He sold 275,000 shares in several sales in late May
and has 350,081 shares remaining, according to the filings.
Mr. Shearer couldn't be reached for comment, but a company
spokesman for the Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based company said
Mr. Shearer sold most of the shares "pursuant to a divorce
settlement."
   Thomas Gruber, senior vice president and chief marketing
officer, sold 10,000 shares on May 25, and has 143,332 shares
remaining, SEC filings show. He said he sold for the "purpose
of paying taxes." The two other insiders, also vice
presidents, sold 1,948 and 2,252 shares each, representing
100% and 31% of their holdings, respectively, according to
the filings.
   The insiders sold their shares at an average price of
$22.43 a share. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Blockbuster shares closed up 37.5 cents at $23.375.

   STOCK COMPACTING: Six vice presidents at Compaq Computer
Corp. sold a total of $3.7 million of its stock in May, SEC
filings show.
   The two largest sales at the Houston-based company were by
Vice President James M. Eckhart, who sold 10,000 common
shares on May 7, and now holds 1,256 shares, and by Ross
Cooley, also a vice president. Mr. Cooley sold 8,964 common
shares on May 29 and now holds 1,035 shares, according to SEC
filings. Both executives declined to comment.
   The other four insiders sold between 1,500 and 5,000

their holdings.
   Bob Beach, a spokesman for Compaq, said all the insiders
sold for personal reasons and added that the company has only
four 30-day periods a year during which insiders can sell
shares.
   The insiders sold at share prices ranging from $104.79 to
$120. The stock has since inched up. In composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Compaq shares closed
at $124.50, up 87.5 cents.

   Responding to a U.S. Supreme Court decision issued last
week, a private psychiatric hospital in Rye, N.Y., proceeded
with a suit seeking more money from the state for Medicaid
services.
   Rye Psychiatric Hospital Center, a private 41-bed
psychiatric facility, is alleging that the state Office of
Mental Health and Department of Social Services violated a
provision of the Medicaid law that requires states to provide
Medicaid reimbursement rates that are "reasonable and
adequate" for efficient medical care. Rye has also sued the
federal government, which approved the state's reimbursement
plan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The lawsuit is believed to be the first filed by a private
psychiatric facility over Medicaid reimbursements. Rye filed
the suit in federal court in White Plains, N.Y., two years
ago but the suit wasn't pursued pending the outcome of the
Supreme Court case.
   In last week's decision (Wilder vs. Virginia Hospital
Association), the Supreme Court ruled that hospitals and
nursing homes may sue state officials under federal law to
force them to provide adequate reimbursement for Medicaid
services.
   The Supreme Court decision is expected to force many
states to increase payments to hospitals and nursing-home
services. Hospitals around the country say they have been
hurt by states' efforts to control rising health care costs.
The hospitals complain that states have set reimbursement
rates so low that providers lose money on Medicaid patients.
Medicaid aids women and children and elderly nursing-home
patients.
   Rye's suit focuses on a state regulation that applies
solely to private psychiatric hospitals. Under that
regulation, the hospitals receive lower Medicaid rates if
their occupancy level falls below 75%. Rye's occupancy rate
runs between 55% and 65%, said Dr. Jack C. Schoenholtz, the
hospital's medical director.
   Dr. Schoenholtz said that the formula unfairly penalizes
the hospital because it does not take into account the
patients' length of stay or the fact that the hospital admits
a disproportionate share of low-income patients with special
needs. In 1989, Rye patients remained in the hospital 36 days
on average, among the lowest of the state's 13 private
psychiatric hospitals, he said.
   "It is an industrywide practice to penalize a hospital
that does not have a high occupancy rate. It's used to
encourage health care providers to take down beds for which
they have a license but which they do not use," said Pamela
Tindall-O'Brien, assistant counsel for the state Office of
Mental Health, which sets Medicaid rates for the state's
private mental health care providers.
   Both sides have asked the judge to rule in their favor
without a trial.

   MARCOS PROSECUTION rests its case in federal racketeering
trial.
   The U.S. Attorney's office concluded its case against
Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines, 11
weeks into the trial. Attorneys for Mrs. Marcos and
co-defendant Adnan Khashoggi said they plan to call no
witnesses on their clients' behalf. Closing arguments in the
case are scheduled to begin Monday, following two days of
procedural hearings this week.
   Mrs. Marcos, facing four counts of racketeering, fraud,
conspiracy and obstruction of justice, is accused of
plundering the Philippines and illegally using the money to
buy artwork, real estate and jewelry in the U.S. On trial
along with her in federal court in Manhattan is Mr.
Khashoggi, a Saudi financier accused of helping Mrs. Marcos
hide her ownership of Manhattan real estate.
   "It's our view that the government has utterly failed in
this case," said Gerry Spence, Mrs. Marcos's attorney. "You
only call witnesses when you have a case to rebut."
   When the trial began, Mr. Spence promised to call a wide
range of witnesses, including President George Bush and a
witness in the Philippines who claimed to have helped Mrs.
Marcos's late husband discover a hoard of gold. Mr. Spence
has said that the gold -- a legendary treasure supposedly
hidden by a Japanese general during World War II -- accounted
for the Marcoses' wealth. Mr. Marcos, who was ousted as
president of the Philippines in 1986 and came to the U.S.,
died last September.
   Prosecutors called nearly 100 witnesses, including
Philippine National Bank officials, who testified that secret
accounts were set up by Mr. Marcos and that government money
was used in personal spending by the Marcos family.
   Mrs. Marcos's attorneys maintained that the spending was
for legitimate government expenses, and that Mrs. Marcos knew
nothing about the alleged theft and fraud.

   INDUSTRIAL PIPE companies settle price-fixing case for
$5.2 million.
   In Houston, U.S. District Judge Norman W. Black approved
the agreement with 14 pipe manufacturers and suppliers named
as defendants in a class action lawsuit. The civil suit was
brought on behalf of hundreds of businesses that bought pipe
used in paper mills, nuclear plants and oil refineries.
   Filed in late 1988, the suit alleged that the defendants
violated federal antitrust laws by conspiring to overcharge
customers between January 1966 and December 1985. Allegations
against 12 other defendants still are pending, but a trial
date hasn't been set.
   The charges parallel those spelled out in a number of
earlier criminal antitrust actions brought by the U.S.
Justice Department. Most of those government actions have
been resolved, a Justice Department spokesman said.
   Agreeing to pay varying amounts of the $5.2 million civil
settlement were Bear Tubular Steel; Benjamin F. Shaw Co. and
its parent Blount Inc.; Guyon Alloys; ITT Fluid Products
Corp.; Louis Canuso Inc.; Mannesmann International Alloys
Inc.; Newman Flange &amp; Fitting Co.; Pipe Fabricating &amp; Supply
Co.; Power Piping Co.; Ram Forge & Steel; Tad U.S.A. Steel
Pipe Fittings; U.S. Metals; and W.F.I. International.
   ITT Fluid will pay the largest portion at $1.4 million;
Guyon and Mannesmann are each paying at least $800,000.

   CALIFORNIA LAW will close court hearings where trade
secrets are at issue.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian signed into law a bill
that allows closed state court hearings in cases where there
is a "substantial probability" that trade secrets might be
disclosed. A caveat of the law, however, is that owners of
the secret must be able to show that harm from disclosure
outweighs any "overriding public interest" in making
information public.
   The bill is aimed at stemming piracy in the state's huge
computer and high-technology industry. The purpose is to
close a perceived loophole in criminal court procedures that
has resulted in defendants in trade-secrets theft cases
avoiding prosecution by threatening to reveal the very
secrets they allegedly stole.
   "You're a pirate; you steal it, then you say, `Okay,
prosecute me. But if you do, I'll recite the secret in open
court, or I'll put it in depositions where it becomes a
matter of public record,'" said a spokesman for Chuck
Quackenbush, the California legislator who sponsored the
bill. Many companies, faced with that dilemma, have decided
not to prosecute when faced with the risk of widespread
dissemination of their property rights, he said.
   The law doesn't set fines or penalties for disclosure of
such secrets in court, but establishes a mechanism by which
proceedings can be closed upon probable cause that a secret
may be revealed.

   JUDGE FINALIZES RULING that Amoco is liable in oil spill.
   Amoco Corp. will appeal the ruling that it must pay about
$160 million in damages related to a 1978 oil spill.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge Charles R. Norgle
relates to suits brought against Amoco by various French
entities and Shell Oil Co., following a spill by the Amoco
Cadiz supertanker of more than 68 million gallons of oil
along the coast of France. Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch
Petroleum Co., owned the ship's cargo.
   The case was originally heard by Frank J. McGarr, a
federal judge who later sitting as special master
preliminarily decided its outcome.
   Amoco said that in addition to appealing, it will seek to
have responsibility for payment of the damage awards passed
on to the builder of the Cadiz, Astilleros Espanoles S.A., of
Spain.
   It was also ruled that Astilleros was liable for design
and construction flaws that contributed to the accident in
which the 1,095-foot tanker ran aground. The court has not
yet set the amount of damages to be paid by the company.
   A spokesman for Amoco said insurance coverage, reserves
and a damage fund set up in 1978 will negate any "material
adverse affect to the company."

   Technology &amp; Health:
   Hospitals Hire Revenue Recovery Firms
   To Inflate Bills, Senate Panel Claims

   WASHINGTON -- A Senate panel is accusing hospitals of
hiring firms that inflate hospital bills through questionable
billings, while hiding overcharges.
   The practice, which can contribute to rising health-care
costs, will be the subject of a hearing to be held today by
the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a report prepared for the hearings, the panel focused
on two so-called revenue recovery firms, but it said there
are at least 35 such companies operating nationwide.
   Hospitals are more inclined to hire revenue recovery firms
as their profit margins continue to be squeezed through
public and private cost controls, and the added burden of
providing uncompensated care for the indigent.
   Revenue recovery firms often contract with hospitals to
review bills on a contingency-fee or percentage-of-recovery
basis -- sometimes 50% of the amount of charges recovered.
Because such payment schemes encourage abuse, Big Eight
accounting firms said their ethics standards prohibit such
arrangements.
   The Senate panel's report found that revenue recovery
firms "teach auditors to downplay or ignore overcharges,"
while pressuring employees to find undercharges. One firm
required that each auditor find at least $1,225 in
undercharges each day, according to the report. Some auditors
not meeting their quotas were fired, the report said.
   The General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress,
reviewed accounts at four Los Angeles-area hospitals that
were audited by Manns Co., a revenue recovery firm based in
Rolling Hills Estates, Calif. Although Manns uncovered
overcharges in 15% of the cases audited, GAO investigators
found overcharges were present in 99% of the cases audited,
according to Senate investigators.
   "It depends on what you call an overcharge," said Dan
O'Callaghan, Manns vice president, finance. "We took off $7
million in overcharges in the past two years in our client
hospitals."
   Revenue recovery employees often conceal their involvement
with a hospital bill out of fear that an insurance company
will then review that bill, investigators charged. Some
revenue recovery employees pose as hospital employees in
answering telephone inquiries from patients or insurers, they
said.
   The Health Insurance Association of America, concerned
about the practices of revenue recovery firms, has formed a
task force to study the issue. The HIAA complains that
hospitals increasingly are erecting barriers to keep them
from auditing questionable hospital bills. Some hospitals
have begun charging several hundred dollars or more just for
the right to audit a bill. The association also complains
that hospitals discourage audits through stalling tactics.
   Partly as a result of these barriers, insurers rarely
review bills under $5,000, the Senate panel said.

   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Conner Peripherals Inc. and Seagate
Technology Inc. said they settled a lawsuit filed by Conner
alleging Seagate had unlawfully deprived the company of its
supply of thin-film heads, a component in hard-disk drives.
   Under the settlement, Seagate will furnish Conner with the
heads "until 1991 on typical industry terms and conditions."
Conner will drop its lawsuit and all other claims related to
the dispute.

   Tokyo stock prices retrenched in light trading as buying
interest dried up amid fading expectations for lower interest
rates as well as a lack of any other incentives.
   Meanwhile, London stocks ended a sluggish session narrowly
mixed with few fresh developments to inspire investors.

<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 336.42 points to
32040.38 on Tuesday.
   At the end of the morning session in Tokyo Wednesday, the
Nikkei index was up 140.27 points to 32180.65.
   Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 330
million shares, in line with 319.7 million shares Monday.
   Decliners outnumbered gainers 813 to 182, while 129 issues
were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, dropped 27.10 points, or 1.14%, to 2353.93.
   Second-section stocks, which had advanced strongly in the
past five trading days, also finished lower yesterday. The
second section index lost 33.53 points, or 0.80%, to 4145.06.
The section's volume was estimated at 24 million shares, down
from 35.9 million shares Monday.
   The Nikkei Index opened 130 points lower on discouraged
sentiments from the 53-point loss on the Dow Jones Industrial
Average in New York overnight, prompted partly by higher
interest rates on the U.S. bond market.
   The Tokyo market saw some buying by bargain hunters when
the Nikkei fell below 32000 points midmorning, but failed to
attract further buying interest, traders said.
   Participants had thought lower U.S. interest rates might
help drag down Japanese interest rates. But such expectations
are fading because of better-than-expected reports recently
on a series of U.S. economic indicators, observers said.
   Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of stock trading at Nikko
Securities, attributed yesterday's drop in the Nikkei Index
to a setback of small- and midsize capital stocks, which had
been performing well while large-capital shares were falling
in the past week.
   Large-capital shares, meanwhile, extended recent losses.
Shipbuilding, steel, construction, trading house and real
estate shares were under strong sell pressure linked to
margin calls, traders said.
   As these sectors were heavily bought during the last week
of December, "they are having the hardest period," said
Tetsuji Hamazaki, general manager of investment information
at W.I. Carr, Sons &amp; Co.
   "The biggest damage to the market is the complete
withdrawal of institutional investors," said Yoshihiro Ito,
general manager of stock trading at Okasan Securities.
   Institutions were determined to remain on the sidelines
until they see the result of German monetary union, the
Soviet Communist Party conference and the Group of Seven
nations summit meeting, all of which are slated for July,
traders said.
   Steel shares continued to decline, with Sumitomo Metal
losing 21 yen to 570 yen (14 cents to $3.71), and NKK down 14
yen at 656 yen.
   Other notable losers included electric power companies
such as Kansai Electric Power, which fell 120 yen to 3500
yen, and mining shares such as Nippon Mining, which plummeted
27 yen to 983 yen.
   A few shares that managed to finish higher included
Dainippon Pharmaceutical, as potential profits of its
anti-cancer agent continued to attract investors. Dainippon
gained 50 yen to 3290 yen. Fuji Photo Film was bought for its
strong earnings outlook, gaining 90 yen to 4290 yen.
   In London, the lack of U.K. economic indicators or major
corporate news, combined with the Royal Ascot horse race
meeting kept investment interest at a minimum, dealers said.
   Although the market opened nearly 25 points down, dealers
said there was no outright selling and the lower levels
inspired some genuine institutional interest. "Institutions
are reluctant to sell any stock so close to the end of the
quarter," one market maker said. "The small amount of buying
and the reluctance to sell has had a disproportionate effect
on the market. It's been very quiet," he added.
   By the closing bell, 50 stocks of the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index managed to chalk up
gains, while 42 shares ended in negative territory. An
additional eight issues were unchanged.
   At the final tally, the FT-SE 100 Share Index was down 0.8
point at 2369.7, near the day's best level of 2372.9. The
index hit its intraday minimum of 2348.9 not long after the
official opening.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell 4.5 points to
1907.4. Volume was 408.3 million shares, little changed from
403.4 million issues a day ago.
   Additionally, the week's U.K. economic data kept many
potential players sidelined, market watchers said. Expected
today are U.K. money supply figures, and balance of payments
data are due Friday. Dealers were also keeping a close eye on
Wall Street after Monday's skid.
   The shares of many defense-related companies fell after
the British government said Monday it is aiming to cut 3%, or
about #600 million ($1.03 billion), from the #21.2 billion
budgeted for defense spending in the year to March 31.
   U.K. Defense Secretary Tom King Monday announced an
immediate ban on new equipment orders pending an examination
of where and how additional savings can be met. The Tornado
fighters, developed by a consortium including British
Aerospace PLC, are the first major casualty.
   British Aerospace slipped 14 pence lower to 546 pence,
while GEC fell 9 pence to 208 pence, Vickers dropped 3 pence
to 233 pence, and Rolls-Royce fell 5 pence to 217 pence.
   In other shares, Charter Consolidated, which reported a
12% rise in pretax profit for fiscal 1990, dropped 9 pence to
454 pence.
   BET added 7 pence to 259 pence after reporting good
full-year earnings a day ago. Several dealers said the shares
have been upgraded by a slew of brokerage firms that were
cheered by the company's statement that it wouldn't be making
any acquisitions this year.
   Globe Investment Trust fell a penny to 204 pence after the
British Coal pension funds announced it would extend its
#1.02 billion bid for the company to Monday after failing to
gain control of the company as the previous deadline lapsed.
   Elsewhere, stocks ended higher in Frankfurt and Paris,
lower in Stockholm, Madrid and Brussels and mixed in
Amsterdam, Milan and Zurich. South African gold stocks closed
slightly lower.
   Also, shares closed lower in Taipei, Sydney, Singapore,
Manila, Wellington and Seoul, and were higher in Hong Kong.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The

   It looks as if freshman Congressman Chuck Douglas of New
Hampshire is on his way to lifting one of the great veils of
secrecy that envelops political behavior in Washington. This
one allows House Members the hypocritical luxury of
co-sponsoring popular bills and then letting them languish or
die in unfriendly committees. Last month, he simply said that
on June 15 he would reveal the names of those Members who
backed Texas Democrat Charles Stenholm's balanced-budget
amendment to the Constitution but refused to sign the
necessary discharge petition to permit a floor vote. Though
several Members pressured Rep. Douglas to back down, they
also scrambled to sign the petition. Yesterday, Rep. Douglas
announced that in only three weeks a 218-Member majority had
signed, assuring the first vote on a balanced-budget
amendment since 1982. Now that the Douglas "sunshine" tactic
has worked, we hope other Members use it to pry loose
legislation the House leadership has buried.

   Commodities:
   Prices of Crude Oil Fall to Their Lowest Level
   In 18 Months Because of Oversupply in Market

   NEW YORK -- Crude oil prices fell to their lowest level in
18 months in a market plagued by oversupply.
   Despite some signs that production by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries is declining slightly, prices
continued to slip. Any token cuts by cartel members Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates are having little impact "in a
market grossly oversupplied with crude," said Andrew Lebow,
analyst for E.D. &amp; F. Man International Futures Inc.

   The futures price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for
delivery during July fell 29 cents a barrel to $15.65, while
crude for August declined by three cents to $16.92 a barrel.
Action was brisk as trading of the July contract came to an
end yesterday. Futures prices declined for all barrels of the
U.S. benchmark crude being traded through the rest of the
year.
   Gasoline and heating oil prices declined as well.
   Early trading today may receive some support from
statistics released after trading yesterday by the American
Petroleum Institute. With inventory levels being such an
important factor in the pricing picture, traders have been
anxiously awaiting the release of these numbers.
   The figures showed that U.S. crude inventories last week
declined by 1.2 million barrels to 384.4 million. But
industry experts point out that despite the decline, crude
stocks still remain 44.3 million barrels above last year's
level.
   Gasoline stocks fell to 216.6 million barrels from 217
million the previous week.
   Putting more downward pressure on oil prices, at least
eight oil companies, including Chevron Corp. and Mobil Corp.,
cut the posted price for their crudes yesterday.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of hog and pork belly futures
contracts slid lower on continuing speculation that record
high retail prices of pork are cooling consumer demand, said
Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, St.
Louis. Prices of hogs and pork soared earlier this spring
amid unexpectedly tight supplies of hogs ready for slaughter.
In recent weeks, hog prices have cooled amid signs that
supermarkets are cutting back their pork purchases and
promoting beef and poultry more heavily. The price of the hog
contract for June delivery, for example, has slipped 8% in
trading so far this month. Traders are divided over whether
the price decline is running out of steam. Some analysts are
speculating that hog prices are past their peak because
farmers are likely to begin expanding their herds. Others,
however, reason that prices might pop up again in the summer,
which is when hog prices often reach their peak.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices fell back from recent advances. The
July contract ended with a loss of 0.90 cents a pound at
$1.13. By late last week the market had become oversold and
began to rise, one analyst noted. On Monday the July contract
hit a high for the move at $1.1540, he said, but yesterday
its highest level was $1.1530, he noted. That technical
development indicated that the rally had run its course, he
said. Also, he said, while prices were rising, the open
interest, or contracts outstanding that remain to be
nullified by an opposite trade or fulfilled by delivery of
the commodity, fell. "This means that the buying during the
rally for the most part was really liquidation by traders
who'd previously sold short," he said. Another analyst said
the market fell simply because it ran out of rumors. On
Monday, there was a report, which proved unfounded, that O.K.
Tedi, a large mine in Papua New Guinea, had labor
difficulties, and there has been talk that Asarco Inc., a
large U.S. producer, was encountering problems in its talks
with the United Steelworkers Union, the analyst said. The
current contract expires June 30. "Actually," he said, "the
O.K. Tedi rumor had some impact Monday, but the Asarco one
hasn't. The price went down because traders don't believe
it." An Asarco spokesman confirmed that the union had asked
for a strike vote, but added, "That's a normal move in the
course of negotiations. They're still dealing with local
issues."
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices fell sharply for the third
consecutive day. The July contract ended with a loss of 9.60
cents a pound at $1.6670 after its daily permissible limit
decline of 10 cents left the price at $1.6630. In three
trading sessions the cumulative loss has been 23.45 cents.
All other deferred months dropped their five-cent daily limit
for the third straight day. The limit will be expanded today
to eight cents. The collapse began after two recent reports
were misconstrued by traders, said Judith Ganes, analyst for
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., New York. Two weeks ago, several small
Brazilian processors offered European and Canadian customers
a limited quantity of the concentrate for a short time at
special prices, said Ms. Ganes. "This gave rise to the false
belief that Brazil was cutting prices and a selling wave hit
the market," said Ms. Ganes. Last week, the Florida
Department of Citrus reported April consumption in the U.S.
was sharply below a year earlier, which created further
pessimism among traders, she said. "What traders didn't take
into account is that last year's consumption figure was
really skewed and larger than normal because there had been a
significant switch to orange juice from apple juice by
consumers because of the Alar chemical scare," Ms. Ganes
said. This distortion exaggerated the year-to-year drop, she
said. Ms. Ganes noted, however, that a price rebound may be
in the making. Processor demand for contracts has been active
but has been overcome by the heavy speculative selling. July
2 is the first day on which notices to deliver concentrate
against July contracts will be issued. Fundamentals still
indicate a tight supply situation, and the Brazilian selling
price, $2.12 a pound, remains well above the U.S. market, she
noted. "If processors can survive the selling over the next
two weeks, they can ask for delivery of the concentrate. The
bulk of the sellers are funds and speculators, who don't have
the material to deliver. If they begin to buy back contracts
to avoid delivery commitments, the price could shoot up," she
said.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Some Firms Quit 15-Second TV Spots

   Ever since the big TV networks started allowing 15-second
commercials instead of standard 30-second ads, the number of
short spots has been spiraling out of control. Quietly,
though, some advertisers are starting to abandon 15-second
spots, frustrated by messages that are over almost before
they begin.
   A number of advertisers say they've noticed a flattening
out, and even a decline, in 15-second spots over the past
year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That trend has caught the eye of Robert Coen, director of
forecasting for Interpublic Group's McCann-Erickson. In his
annual ad spending forecast last week, Mr. Coen said that
during prime-time, 15-second spots peaked last year at 35% of
all TV ads and that their number has since slipped to 31%. He
said that during daytime, 15-second spots have leveled off in
the past year at 41% of all commercials. He expects those
levels to remain about the same.
   "It's too difficult to really get satisfying information
into 15 seconds," explains Roy Grace of Grace &amp; Rothschild, a
New York ad agency. "It's an enormous discipline and it's
very hard to do really terrific `15s.' It truly is on the way
out. Clients don't even talk about them anymore."
   Yet the decline masks a split among 15-second commercial
users, only some of whom are abandoning the short ads. When
the networks first began allowing the short spots in 1984,
all sort of advertisers jumped on the bandwagon, especially
small advertisers who couldn't otherwise afford network TV
prices. Those advertisers appear to be the ones who are
abandoning the 15s first, amidst questions about cost and
effectiveness.
   The nation's biggest advertisers, on the other hand,
especially packaged goods companies pushing major brand
names, continue to be advocates of the 15-second ads. For
them, the 15s, which generally cost half of a 30-second spot,
are a relatively cheap way to hammer home their household
names. And cost counts at a time when the average prime-time
30-second spot goes for an eye-opening $120,000.
   Indeed, at RJR Nabisco's Nabisco Brands brands unit, a
spokeswoman says the use of 15-second spots has been on the
rise for the past three years, especially for its best-known
products, like Oreos and Ritz crackers. It even uses the 15s
for brand extensions, like fudge-covered Oreos and
peanut-butter Ritz Bits.
   "Nabisco's products are very well-established, so a
15-second commercial serves to reinforce the product's
message," the spokeswoman says. "People know Oreos, people
know Ritz. The basic product is so ingrained in them that
with a new variety, we can still get the message across in 15
seconds."
   At Omnicom's DDB Needham ad agency, Page Thompson,
executive vice president and media director, also doesn't see
a decline. One of the agency's biggest clients, Michelin,
even started using 15-second spots for the first time this
year. The Michelin ad, a shorter version of its long-running
baby campaign, "has a lot of equity in it, and it's a very
simple message, so we were able to convey that in 15s," he
says. "We were able to get a lot more mileage for the
campaign."
   For the most part, though, major advertisers are leveling
off on using 15-second spots, while smaller advertisers are
often abandoning them altogether. The networks are partly to
blame; in the past year, they've put more restrictions on
using the short ads. While policies vary from network to
network, some charge a premium for sports or other programs,
while others ban or restrict the use of "bookends" -- two
15-second spots for the same product that air with unrelated
ads sandwiched in between them.
   Advertisers, too, have become disenchanted with a
commercial form so short that there's almost no time to grab
viewers' attention. The 15-second ads "started out as a way
for advertisers who couldn't really afford national media to
take advantage of it," says Stacey Lippman, senior vice
president and corporate media director for Chiat/Day/Mojo.
But competition has heated up so much for those advertisers
that "they're willing to forgo the quick hit to stand out
from their competitors" with ads that have "a creative, added
impact."
   At Chiat/Day, known as among the most creative agencies,
"I've seen some frustration on the part of creatives in terms
of their ability to get a message out," Mr. Lippman adds.
   Betsy Frank, a senior vice president at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising, says she has also seen some decline in 15-second
ads. But she notes that they still account for a good third
of all commercials, a potentially worrisome amount,
considering how cluttered the ad environment is already.
Saatchi is about to launch a study of the short spots and,
Ms. Frank notes, "we wouldn't be doing this if we felt it was
no longer an issue."

   Fourth Japanese Firm Says It Bought
   Software From U.S. Defense Contractor

   TOKYO -- A fourth Japanese concern acknowledged purchasing
advanced U.S. aerospace software that allegedly was exported
without proper licensing.
   Mitsubishi Research Institute Inc. said it purchased the
software package from Plume Technology Inc., a small Los
Angeles defense contractor. Last week, a Plume executive,
Ronald Hoffman, was arrested for illegally exporting the
software, designed for the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative
program.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An institute spokesman declined to say for what purpose
the software was acquired. "We bought it because it was
interesting," the spokesman said. "That's all we can say."
The spokesman didn't know whether the institute dealt
directly with Mr. Hoffman.
   The institute, an independent entity, is affiliated with
the Mitsubishi Group, one of Japan's most powerful industry
families. Another member of the group, Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd., and two other companies, Nissan Motor Co.
and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., on Monday
confirmed purchasing the software. The Japanese purchases
were made between 1986 and 1989.
   The companies confirm that they purchased the software,
known as the Contam system, but insist that they had no
knowledge of its use in the so-called Star Wars program.
Moreover, they assert that they obtained all necessary import
licenses from the Japanese government. The purchasers say
they were taken by surprise by the allegations against Mr.
Hoffman.
   In addition, Mitsubishi Corp., the giant trading house
that served as middleman for Mitsubishi Heavy in the
purchase, and Kyokuto Boeki Kaisha Ltd., a small trading firm
that played the same role for Nissan, also said that they
followed normal importing procedures and didn't know the
software was restricted. The trading houses and IHI, which
purchased the software without a middleman, said they were
offered the technology by Mr. Hoffman, who was representing
Plume Technology.
   "As you know, export permission is the seller's
responsibility," said a spokesman for Mitsubishi Corp. "We
have no means to check whether they obtained the export
permission or not. This is a fact of international trade. We
are responsible for the procedures on the Japan side."
   Kyokuto Boeki and IHI also asserted it was Plume's
responsibility to obtain U.S. export permits, and it wouldn't
be possible in Japan to verify whether they were obtained. A
spokesman for Kyokuto Boeki added that Plume had requested
the necessary documentation for export licenses.
   Mitsubishi Heavy and IHI say they are employing the Contam
package in the development of the Japan Experimental Module,
slated to be part of a space station the U.S. will launch
later this decade. Nissan said it is using the software to
create simulation models for rocket-engine development.
   In an affidavit filed in federal court in Los Angeles, the
U.S. government said the Contam software was designed to
analyze the exhaust trail of missiles in flight, an important
part of SDI research.
   In Tokyo, the U.S. Embassy said that "the investigation is
continuing in an effort to determine culpability on the part
of other persons involved in the scheme."

   Stocks Make a Modest Recovery
   Amid Worry Over Earnings, Rates

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices rebounded only modestly from
their sharp drop Monday as worries about corporate earnings
and interest rates made for another day of sluggish trading.
   Buyers focused largely on growth stocks, especially those
in the consumer sector, in an effort to dodge any possible
disappointments in second-quarter earnings reports.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 11.38 to 2893.56
after posting its sharpest loss in five months Monday, when
the 30-stock average fell 53.71 points. A rally in Philip
Morris and solid gains among other blue-chip consumer issues
fueled the recovery.
   Trading activity, however, improved only marginally from
Monday's pace as the plunge in prices failed to stimulate
much bargain-hunting among investors. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange totaled 134,930,000 shares; in the prior
session, 133,470,000 changed hands.
   Many institutions will close their books on the second
quarter Friday, the last day on which trades can be made for
settlement before the end of the period. With that deadline
approaching, "People are saying, `Well, the market's had a
nice run. What do we do here?' " said Larry Greenwald, a
block trader at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.
   Broader market indexes kept pace with the industrial
average, as Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index gained 1.59 to
358.47, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index went up
0.68 to 195.61 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added
1.27 to 333.77.
   But advancing issues outpaced decliners narrowly on the
Big Board, where 788 issues rose in price and 710 fell, and
secondary issues generally failed to share in the advance.
Prices dropped slightly on the over-the-counter market, and
the American Stock Exchange Market Value Index posted a
fractional gain.
   Stocks peaked in early trading within a point of 2900 on
the Dow industrials, but two late-morning bursts of sell
programs linked to stock-index arbitrage erased those gains.
The programs, involving the sale of stocks and the purchase
of index-futures contracts, went into effect after the
futures slipped to relatively low levels compared with the
cash indexes.
   But index arbitrage worked in the market's favor during
the afternoon, traders said, as an outburst of program buying
played a part in its upturn.
   The advance came against the backdrop of continued
weakness in bond prices, which have been on the decline since
last week's round of economic reports dimmed hopes for any
moves by the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy.
   Meanwhile, a recent spate of indications that
second-quarter earnings may fall short of expectations "just
drives people to the stocks where they have a high confidence
of near-term earnings performance," said A. Marshall Acuff
Jr., a portfolio strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co.
   Growth stocks "have been the leaders in the market, and as
far as I'm concerned, they'll remain the leaders," Mr. Acuff
said, as investors concentrate on issues with "the best
quality, the strongest financials, and the highest visibility
of earnings."
   Philip Morris climbed 1 1/2 to 44 1/4 as 1.6 million
shares changed hands in Big Board composite trading. Other
consumer stocks giving a lift to the industrial average
included American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which added 5/8 to
42 1/2; Procter &amp; Gamble, which climbed 1 1/8 to 83 5/8, and
Woolworth, which rose 5/8 to 33 3/4.
   On the other hand, Occidental Petroleum fell 5/8 to 26 as
Standard &amp; Poor's decision to downgrade the company's debt
and preferred stock ratings sparked heavy selling. The stock
traded as low as 25 3/8 and was the Big Board's most active
issue by a wide margin, with about 2.6 million shares traded.
   S&amp;P's action, which the rating agency attributed to high
fixed costs, heavy dividend requirements and anticipated
earnings weakness at Occidental, triggered speculation that
the company may sell its 51% interest in IBP in order to
improve its financial position. IBP rose 1 to 18 1/8 on about
four times the stock's average volume. Occidental declined to
comment.
   Chrysler gained 1 1/8 to 16 5/8 on 1.7 million shares,
reflecting speculation that Italy's Fiat may acquire a major
stake in the company as part of an alliance currently under
discussion. Fiat officials, however, said the most likely
outcome of the talks is an arrangement under which the
Italian concern helps Chrysler develop new models.
   Motorola fell 7/8 to 85. A federal judge in Texas ordered
the company to pull its most successful computer chip, the
68030, off the market as the result of a patent dispute with
Japan's Hitachi.
   Monsanto dropped 3/4 to 50. Merrill Lynch lowered its
estimates of the company's earnings for this year and next,
based on a belief that its agricultural division will suffer
because wet weather is hampering the planting of corn.
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, which disclosed plans to
restructure its U.S. tire and sales operations, eased 1/4 to
33 3/4. The company estimated that it would report a
second-quarter loss of as much as $10 million after charges
related to the restructuring.
   MGM/UA Communications fell 1 1/8 to 17 1/8 amid published
reports that Time Warner may be reconsidering its offer to
provide $650 million in financing for Pathe Communications'
proposed takeover of the company. Pathe remained unchanged at
3 7/8, while Time Warner added 7/8 to 105 1/8.
   Wendy's International, the subject of yesterday's "Heard
on the Street" column in this newspaper, dropped 1/8 to 6
3/4. The stock reached a two-year high last week amid
speculation that PepsiCo may be interested in the company,
but analysts are skeptical of the rumors.
   Kuhlman rose 1/2 to 12 5/8. The company agreed to sell its
blow-molded plastics business for about $45 million to a
subsidiary of Solvay, a Belgian concern.
   The Amex Market Value Index added 0.07 to 360.83. Volume
totaled 9,040,000 shares.

   Plan to Include $45 Billion
   To $50 Billion of Cuts
   In Deficit for Fiscal 1991

   WASHINGTON -- White House Budget Director Richard Darman
intends to make an expanded budget proposal today to try to
jump-start the stalled budget talks with Congress, according
to people familiar with the Bush administration's strategy.
   The proposal is expected to include deficit cuts of $45
billion to $50 billion in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct 1.
The heart of the new proposal will probably be a stiff $17
billion cut in projected spending on so-called entitlement
programs, such as Medicare and farm programs, for which
spending is set by a formula. That's about $5 billion deeper
than the cuts proposed in President Bush's January budget.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, the administration is likely to propose a cut
of about $3.5 billion in suggested discretionary spending on
domestic programs -- the same cut recommended in the plan
approved by the Senate Budget Committee in May. And it is
expected to propose $20 billion in new revenue and user fees,
most of which were in the president's January budget.
   The proposal will also call for a somewhat larger
reduction in defense spending than the $3.2 billion cut the
president has supported.
   The administration previously proposed a $36.5 billion
deficit-reduction package, and Democratic leaders have been
calling on President Bush to make a new budget proposal for
weeks. The administration's new proposal is certain to be
unacceptable to the Democrats because it relies mostly on
domestic-spending cuts.
   But Democrats face a delicate decision on how to respond.
Some may favor using Mr. Darman's new proposal as a starting
point for negotiations; others may want to attack the plan as
little more than posturing.
   In talks yesterday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told the
summit that cutting military forces 25% over the next five
years won't reduce spending much below the levels outlined in
Mr. Bush's January budget. Democrats, who see sharp cuts in
Pentagon spending as a key to shrinking the federal budget
deficit, quickly noted that Mr. Cheney's latest figures
assume no cuts in research and development and only minimal
changes in the Pentagon's procurement plans.
   Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.) and Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.),
chairmen of the Armed Services committees, said Mr. Cheney's
presentation didn't advance the talks. Any new Bush
administration proposal on defense spending will come only as
part of a broader deficit-reduction proposal, Rep. Aspin
predicted.
   Although the details are far from settled, cutting
military forces by 25% is emerging as a consensus position.
Mr. Cheney tried to convince Democrats that it would take far
deeper and more disruptive cuts to reduce the Pentagon budget
as much as they envision. Judging from the reaction of
Democratic negotiators, he didn't succeed.
   Mr. Cheney said such a force reduction would trim about
10% from the projected defense budget, adjusted for
inflation, over the next five years. But Rep. Aspin insisted,
"If you cut forces by 25%, you get a lot more than 10%
savings." A more reasonable figure, he suggested, is in the
"low 20%" area.
   Mr. Cheney's figures, made available by congressional
negotiators, show that a 25% force reduction would bring
defense outlays in fiscal 1991 to $302 billion, about $1.3
billion lower than Mr. Bush's January budget and about a $5
billion cut from projected levels. For reasons that weren't
immediately clear, Mr. Cheney said the Pentagon budget in
fiscal 1995 actually would be slightly larger than the one
Mr. Bush proposed in January.
   Over the next five years, Mr. Cheney said that cutting
forces 25% would save $102.9 billion from projections that
assume the defense budget keeps pace with inflation. That's
$8.6 billion less than the spending outlined in the Bush
budget.
   Mr. Cheney said the force reduction might mean cutting the
number of active-duty troops by 442,000 over five years to
1.6 million and eliminating 450 of the 950 Minuteman
missiles, four of the 21 strategic bomber squadrons and 111
of the Navy's 566 ships.
   Separately, advocates of a constitutional amendment to
force a balanced federal budget managed to have the measure
sent to a vote on the House floor. Led by Rep. Charles
Stenholm (D., Texas), the backers obtained the 218 signatures
needed to move the amendment from the Judiciary Committee
onto the House floor. A House vote on the measure is expected
by July 26.
   Two-thirds of the 435-member chamber would have to approve
it and send it to the Senate. Advocates say 248 members
support discharging the amendment this year, which would be
39 votes short of the 287 needed.
   The measure would require that federal spending not be
higher than expected federal receipts except during wartime
or when three-fifths of both houses of Congress approves a
budget deficit.

   REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   Busing Reconsidered
</HL>
<DATE>

<LP>
   Seattle is mostly a tolerant and lush place. It tries very
hard to be very good. For 12 years, long after many
communities have decided that school busing for racial
balance paradoxically does not achieve racial balance, the
city has persisted without so much as a court order. Now even
Seattle is nearly ready to consider alternatives. Today the
school board is to consider five plans for scaling back the
busing project. The most ambitious proposal, by trustee
Kenneth Eastlack, would effectively end the idea of busing
children around the city solely for racial purposes.
   The emerald city is coming to recognize that this
much-heralded policy doesn't improve schools or integrate
them very well. It unavoidably causes many poor children to
spend an hour or more of potential learning time riding
around on a bus. And affluent white students find a way out
of the system.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When the city began the program in 1978, it tried to mix
and match youngsters all over town, designating the fourth
through sixth grades and the high school years as pairing-off
periods. Part of the enrollment at a neighborhood school
would be swapped for students from a campus at the opposite
end of town (in Seattle, north is white and south is black).
That didn't work, so the authorities eventually came up with
a "controlled choice" formula that tries to keep minority
enrollment at any school within 20 percentage points of the
total minority share of the district.
   The result? Black south-siders have about twice as much
chance of being sent by bus to an out-of-neighborhood school
as north-side children. About 80% of south-siders are bused
to school, against only 35% of northsiders. The white share
of the system's enrollment has dropped to 45% from 62%. Total
enrollment in Seattle schools has dropped by more than half
over the past 20 years, to about 41,000. In the city's
current economic boom, households without children have been
buying many of the nice homes, while families moved to the
suburbs.
   Mr. Eastlack, who represents a white, working-class area
of West Seattle where opposition to busing is most
pronounced, thinks it's time to act. Lest enrollment take
another sharp drop, he wants to clear the air in time for
fall's reopening. Mr. Eastlack favors some integration
program, in part because he thinks the district will be sued
into one in any case, but he's recommending a loosened
formula: no more than 80% of one race in a school. All of the
schools currently would meet that standard without forced
busing.
   Seattle is fortunate, in that unlike a number of other
American cities its schools are still run by an elected board
and not a federal judge. It can choose. In fact, choice is
the key word here. It is now possible to suggest for the
first time that the busing model in the U.S. may be in the
process of being taken over by the choice model -- an
alternative that draws parents more tightly into the
education of their children.
   As Polly Williams is attempting to demonstrate in
Milwaukee, empowering parents to second guess the teacher
unions and central office is critical to busting the yoke
that weighs heavy on school performance in general and that
of poor urban minorities in particular. If the intent of
busing and other integration plans is to make sure all
students have an equal opportunity for good schools, the
provision of choice through vouchers or simple
school-selection options is looking more than ever like a
better way to go.

   MENLO PARK, Calif. -- Consolidated Freightways Inc.,
buffeted by continuing losses at its Emery Worldwide
air-freight unit, said it will suspend its quarterly dividend
as part of an agreement with lenders providing a new line of
credit of as much as $860 million.
   Consolidated said the five-year agreement permits it to
reinstate its 26.5-cent-a-share payout "subject to meeting
certain performance standards." A spokesman declined to say
how soon that might be; Consolidated was scheduled to pay its
next dividend after the second quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trucking and air-freight company had gone nine years
without a quarterly deficit until its $230 million
acquisition of loss-plagued Emery last year; Consolidated
also agreed to take on about $240 million in Emery debt.
   Hurt by a slump in its own business and
higher-than-anticipated losses at Emery, Consolidated
reported a fourth-quarter loss of $32.3 million, or $1.01 a
share, on revenue of $991.3 million. In the first quarter,
its loss widened to $33.9 million, or $1.06 a share, on
revenue of $997.7 million.
   Consolidated said that although losses at Emery have
narrowed in recent months, "Emery's long-term prospects are
dependent on substantially increased business levels." At the
time of its acquisition, Emery, battered by stiffening
competition in the international air-freight market, had
three consecutive years of losses. Consolidated viewed the
purchase as central to its strategy to compete in the global
freight-hauling business.

   State Farm Agrees to Observe New Law
   On Pennsylvania Auto Insurance Rates
   ----

INSURANCE (INS)
</IN>
<LP>
   State Farm Insurance Cos., the largest auto insurer in
Pennsylvania, has agreed to comply with the state's new auto
insurance law, which goes into effect next month.
   In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Gov. Robert Casey said he
believes State Farm's settlement "will induce other companies
to comply with the law." With State Farm, 181 of the 224
companies writing auto insurance in Pennsylvania have agreed
to roll back their rates as mandated by the new law.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 43 companies that haven't complied include Allstate
Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., and Erie
Insurance Co., two of the larger auto insurers in the state.
"We will see people shifting (their policies) and moving to
other companies," Gov. Casey said at a news conference
yesterday afternoon. Companies that don't comply could "risk
losing policyholders," he said.
   State Farm insures 1.4 million cars in Pennsylvania,
representing about 18% of the state's market. The company
wrote $309 million in auto insurance premiums last year in
Pennsylvania, or about 2% of the total. State Farm, a mutual
company which is owned by its policyholders, is the largest
auto insurer in the country.
   Pennsylvania's auto insurance law, enacted in February,
requires insurers to drop auto rates 10% for all drivers and
22% for drivers who waive their right to sue in all but the
most severe accidents. The lower rates are scheduled to go
into effect July 1.
   James Tuite, State Farm's counsel, said the company felt
compelled to come to some agreement with state officials if
it wanted to continue to do business in Pennsylvania: "This
law presented a dilemma. The coverages had been changed. We
couldn't issue old bills, use old rates and still go on with
our business while we challenged the new law. We had to file
new rates."
   Although State Farm has made peace with Pennsylvania
officials, "we're still concerned that the rollbacks aren't
justified" by the cost-saving measures in the new law, Mr.
Tuite said.
   The agreement between State Farm and Pennsylvania calls
for the state Insurance Department to hold a hearing today to
determine what base rate State Farm will use for calculating
the 10% and 22% premium reductions. The company had filed for
a 2.3% increase last October. The department will issue its
decision by Friday, and State Farm has agreed to file
immediately the rollbacks calculated on that base.
   State Farm and the state also agreed to let a Pennsylvania
court decide whether State Farm can include the 2.3% increase
in its base rate. The state contends that the rate filing was
rendered void when the new law was enacted. The company says
it should be allowed to include the increase because the
filing predated the law. If the company prevails, Gov. Casey
said, policyholders will probably see rate rollbacks of about
8% and 20%. Oral arguments were heard last week, and a
decision is pending.
   The company says it would lose $103 million in one year on
an underwriting basis if it were required to roll back rates
from current levels. Even if it included its net investment
income in its rate-of-return calculations, State Farm said,
it would still have a loss.
   The state agreed to drop State Farm from a lawsuit it
filed against six major insurers seeking to force them to
comply with the new law. Four other State Farm cases
currently pending also will be dropped, the Insurance
Department said.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   In Contest for Governor in New York, the Stakes
   Are High and the Odds Are Long for Republicans

   ALBANY, N.Y. -- This is a ticket that's not going to play
on Broadway -- or hardly anywhere else in New York State.
   It's the Republican ticket headed by Pierre Rinfret, a
wealthy economics consultant from New York City, running for
governor against Democrat Mario Cuomo and already in hot
water.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But it's only the latest calamity to befall the state's
once-proud GOP, the empire that was built by Thomas Dewey and
Nelson Rockefeller. The state party is broke, its upstate
base is crumbling, and even Suffolk County, a Long Island
bastion, has strayed from the GOP path. Worst of all, command
of the GOP fortress, the state Senate, lost to the Democrats
only once (in 1965, for a single year) since World War II, is
at risk.
   This could be the year that sets the course of New York
politics for a decade.
   Mr. Rinfret (pronounced Rin-fray) is the obvious and
visible symbol of the party's disarray. He was literally
chosen out of an address book -- Laurence Leeds's address
book. Mr. Leeds is a Manhattan investment banker who was
asked for help by a desperate state Sen. Roy Goodman, a
member of a search committee charged with finding a
candidate. Mr. Leeds flipped through the pages until he came
to "R," and there was "Rinfret, Pierre." The 66-year-old Mr.
Rinfret agreed to make the run, reportedly pledging anywhere
from $100,000 to $500,000 of his own resources as "earnest
money" and holding out the possibility that his wealthy
clients would come up with lots more. He enrolled as a
Republican after he was chosen as the party's standard
bearer. His running mate, George Yancey Jr., the candidate
for lieutenant governor, runs Heluva Good Cheese Inc., in
Sodus, in upstate New York. His friends call Mr. Yancey
Geoff.
   The first sign of future trouble was the disclosure that
Mr. Rinfret wasn't even a Republican. He was a registered
independent who thought he was a Republican.
   What frustrates many GOP strategists is the belief that
it's the Democrats who should be in trouble. The state's
economy, which performed vigorously through 1988, is in sharp
retreat, and Gov. Cuomo managed to put together this year's
budget only "by using every ounce of preventive medicine,"
according to Richard Nathan, director of the Nelson
Rockefeller Institute of Government here. "He exhausted all
the possibilities. Now things get really tough."
   But not a single leading Republican would listen to J.
Patrick Barrett, the GOP state chairman and former chairman
of Avis Inc., when he made the rounds with a briefcase full
of statewide polls suggesting Mr. Cuomo was more vulnerable
than most people realized. They all turned him down. "And
so," says Michael Haselswerdt, a political scientist at
Canisius College in Buffalo, "the former Avis chairman was
forced -- appropriately enough -- to rent a Republican."
   And as soon as the decision was made, the man who headed
the GOP wish list, Housing and Urban Development Secretary
Jack Kemp, turned what appeared to be an
embarrassment-in-the-making into low comedy. He lambasted Mr.
Rinfret for emphasizing the death penalty as a campaign issue
instead of Mr. Cuomo's record on taxes, and suggested -- the
unkindest cut of all -- that Mr. Rinfret, who once advised
President Nixon and who now makes millions as a consultant,
doesn't understand how the economy functioned in the Reagan
years.
   The New York Times weighed in with a front-page story
suggesting Mr. Rinfret fraudulently claims the title
"doctor," even though he has never earned a doctorate. (His
official campaign biography says that he "completed graduate
studies in political economy" at the University of Dijon, in
France, in 1950 and that he received an honorary doctor of
laws degree from Pepperdine University in 1973.) The Times
also reported that some former Nixon advisers deny Mr.
Rinfret was a major adviser to the president. (At the time,
though, he was quoted in the syndicated Evans and Novak
column with such frequency that he irritated White House
colleagues.)
   Mr. Rinfret issued a statement saying it is his "earnest
hope that the Times will focus attention on the real issues
of this campaign" and released a letter from former President
Nixon saying he had hoped Mr. Rinfret "would join my
administration as a member of the Council of Economic
Advisers or later as a member of the cabinet."
   If Mr. Rinfret turns out to be a calamitous choice to head
the ticket, Republicans will have only themselves to blame.
   Party professionals worry that an election that should be
a referendum on Mr. Cuomo's performance in office is turning
out to be a showcase for Mr. Rinfret's astonishing,
freewheeling performance. In his initial outings, Mr. Rinfret
promised he would privatize New York City's subways, airports
and bridges. "He's just inviting someone to ask if he's had
any good offers for the Brooklyn Bridge," says Marist
Institute pollster Lee Miringoff.
   Mr. Rinfret caused veteran GOP operatives to blanch when
he invited a woman reporter to his inaugural ball -- and
urged her to leave her husband at home. He threatens to
become an East Coast version of Texas' Clayton Williams, that
state's gaffe-prone Republican candidate for governor, the
difference being that Texans may be more tolerant of
political eccentricity than New Yorkers.
   To make matters worse, two other parties appealing to
prospective GOP voters, the Conservative and Right to Life
parties, are running their own anti-abortion candidates for
governor. Mr. Rinfret supports abortion rights for women, in
line with the state party's recently adopted stance.
   "The Republican Party has lost its way," says Michael
Long, chairman of the Conservative Party. "Our party is
running the only bona fide Republican in the race" -- Herbert
London, a dean at New York University, who sought the
Republican endorsement. "When this election is over," says
Mr. Long, "Pierre Andre Rinfret will be gone. He's not
sticking around to rebuild the Republican Party."
   A thorough rebuilding is what the state party needs. So
far, however, the most visible commitment has been the
$250,000 Mr. Barrett spent to refurbish the party's elegant
townhouse headquarters. "We thought it was important," says
Mr. Barrett. (The Democrats rent shabby space in an
undistinguished downtown office building.)
   The state party also borrowed $400,000 to buy a
state-of-the-art computer system for the GOP state Senate
campaign committee, which is already rolling in money. "We're
very generous," says Mr. Barrett. To top it off, the party's
bookkeeping is under investigation by the State Board of
Elections.
   Traditionally, the party's base has been upstate and in
the New York City suburbs. But, Mr. Barrett acknowledges,
"there has been some erosion in our base." In upstate New
York, Democrats now control Erie County (including Buffalo)
and Monroe County (Rochester) and even Broome County
(Binghamton). On Long Island, they control Suffolk County.
The Republicans have fallen back on machine-controlled Nassau
and Westchester counties.
   "They've lost their triple-A minor-league franchises,"
says William Cunningham, a political consultant who speaks
for the state Democratic Party.
   But the scariest part of all for the GOP is its fear that
it could lose control of the 61-seat state Senate, the
party's last remaining bastion. (The Democrats traditionally
control the Assembly and they have held the governor's seat
for the past 16 years.) The Democrats need a net gain of four
Senate seats to win control.
   "If we lose the Senate," says Robert Haggerty, executive
director of the Republican Senate campaign committee, "we
lose everything." With Democrats in control everywhere, says
Mr. Haggerty, they would redistrict the state legislature and
the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. "They will
redistrict us out of business," Mr. Haggerty says. At a time
when the state faces a post-census loss of three seats to
redistricting, the Republicans fear they could lose six to
unfettered Democratic gerrymandering.
   And so the money is bypassing the state party and flowing
directly to the Senate races. "They'll spend $4 million,"
says the Democrats' Mr. Cunningham. "We'll spend $1 million."
   The importance the national party puts on these Senate
races was highlighted earlier this week. Vice President Dan
Quayle had been scheduled to attend a fund-raiser for the
state party. But those plans were changed; Monday night, he
attended a $5,000-a-plate dinner for the state Senate
committee.

   ICN Biomedicals Inc., Costa Mesa, Calif., said fiscal
second-quarter net income rose 78% to $2.8 million from $1.5
million a year ago, reflecting higher international sales and
other benefits of a recent acquisition.
   Sales more than doubled to $35.3 million from $14.2
million in the quarter ended May 31. Per-share net was 25
cents compared with 15 cents, restated to reflect a 20% stock
dividend paid in August.

   ICN Biomedicals attributed its increases to the strength
of the company's development and marketing of biomedical
research tests and to the sales volume of Flow Laboratories,
acquired in November.
   The company said that international sales jumped to $20.8
million from $1.7 million, mainly reflecting Flow sales,
which are primarily in Europe, Japan and Australia. Flow
produces laboratory equipment, live cells and related
products for life-science research.
   In national over-the-counter trading, ICN Biomedicals fell
12.5 cents to $9.625.

   Sales of a Popular Chip

   Motorola Inc. said a federal court in Washington, D.C.,
granted a temporary stay of an injunction that would have
forced the company to stop selling a popular computer chip
that a lower court found to infringe on Hitachi Ltd. patents.
   Motorola requested the stay soon after a federal judge in
Austin, Texas, entered an order to impose a March ruling that
called for Motorola to stop selling its 68030 chip. In the
March ruling, the Austin judge issued an injunction ordering
Motorola and Hitachi to stop making chips that were found to
infringe on each others' patents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The judge later granted a stay of the injunction, urging
the two to settle the matter out of court. In his order to
lift the stay of injunction, the Austin judge explained that
"the parties have chosen not to forge a settlement in the
interim, and this court is not inclined to continue its
indulgence."
   If enforced, the Austin injunction against the Motorola
chip, one of its hottest sellers, could have hurt computer
makers, such as Apple Computer Inc., that use the chip.
Hitachi wouldn't have been hurt much because it sells few of
the disputed chips in the U.S.
   Motorola said it will file a formal appeal of the Austin
judge's decision in the Washington court by June 22. Motorola
and Hitachi said they were continuing negotiations to settle
the 18-month patent dispute out of court. "Our No. 1 task is
to reach a settlement" through negotiation, said a Hitachi
spokesman.
   The ruling is the latest twist in an 18-month
trans-Pacific patent battle, started by Motorola, in which
Motorola and Hitachi have launched a barrage of suits and
countersuits.
   Motorola had said Monday that the U.S. Patent Office
agreed last week to re-examine Hitachi's patent, which
Motorola claims is invalid on the basis of a 1966 patent. The
patent office has found that "a substantial new question
about (the) Hitachi patent has been raised which has a direct
bearing on the outcome of this case," Motorola said.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Motorola shares fell 87.5 cents apiece to close at $85, while
Hitachi American Depository Receipts fell 62.5 cents apiece
to close at $98.50.

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. official reserve assets rose $745
million in May to $77.03 billion, the Treasury Department
said.
   Last month's rise compared with a $20 million decline in
April to $76.28 billion, the department said.

   U.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies, gold,
special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund and
the U.S.'s reserve position, or ability to draw foreign
currencies, at the IMF.
   The nation's holdings of foreign currencies increased $370
million in May to $46.8 billion, while its gold reserves rose
$5 million to $11.07 billion.

   A Parental-Rights Battle Is Heating Up
   Over Fears of Whooping-Cough Vaccine

   Parental skittishness over the DPT vaccine may be helping
foster a recent resurgence of whooping cough, some health
experts fear.
   Last year, there were 3,745 cases in the U.S. This year,
incidence of the disease is running 38% higher than that, and
epidemics have struck upstate New York, Massachusetts, Ohio,
Colorado and California. Some U.S. authorities fear a repeat
of the situation in England a few years ago, when sharply
lower immunization rates led to a six-year epidemic of
104,000 whooping-cough cases and nearly 400 deaths. There,
hospitals had to open special whooping-cough clinics before
the government began promoting vaccinations again.

   In the U.S., there is a mounting battle over parental
rights as some parents refuse to immunize their children.
Their fears stem from stories of every parent's worst
nightmare.
   One such instance occurred when Janet Ciotoli, an
Endicott, N.Y., nurse, took her healthy two-month-old son,
Richard Anthony, for his first DPT shot, the standard
vaccination against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus. A
violent reaction to the vaccine for pertussis, the formal
name for whooping cough, turned Richard's leg red, then
purple. Thirty-three hours after the shot, he became
unresponsive, limp and ice cold. "Five minutes later, my son
died in my arms," says Ms. Ciotoli.
   Although such tragedies are extremely rare -- of 3.5
million babies immunized for pertussis each year in the U.S.,
only perhaps three dozen develop cases of brain damage or
death -- growing numbers of parents are beginning to compare
such palpable evidence of the shot's danger with what they
see as the more-remote risks of the ravages of whooping
cough. The No. 1 baby killer in the 1920s and '30s, pertussis
reached a low of 1,248 cases and six deaths in this country
in 1981, raising hopes the disease was near eradication here.
   The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control says it
calculates that as many as 95% of school-age children have
been immunized with the five-shot DPT series. But it notes
that more parents are refusing to immunize their children on
philosophical or religious grounds. Some are campaigning to
relax state vaccination requirements. Further, the agency
says, sales of a "DT" vaccine, without the pertussis
component, are on the rise while conventional DPT sales are
slipping.
   "People are really shying away from this vaccine," says
Fritz Dixon, epidemiologist for Idaho, which no longer
mandates immunization of schoolchildren for pertussis, as
required by 41 other states.
   And as the level of immunized U.S. preschoolers slips
toward the 80% rate conducive to epidemics -- a trend
exacerbated by overburdened immunization efforts in inner
cities -- a new hard-line position by medical authorities is
intensifying a ferocious debate over parents' rights.
   The American Medical Association has called on states to
revoke any rights parents may now have to object on
philosophical or religious grounds to vaccinations. A bill
pending in Michigan would bar philosophical exemptions, an
option already revoked in Delaware and Montana. Authorities
are also pushing for better enforcement of existing laws. In
West Virginia, one of two states denying both religious and
philosophical exemptions, eight-year-old Fred Shiflett has
been barred since last fall from school in the town of
Romney, and the Hampshire County school district has sued his
father, who fears the pertussis vaccine. Police arrested
Fred's father because of his child's truancy.
   "In the case of contagious diseases that are preventable
and not treatable, you have to do things that impinge on
people's rights," argues Lucy Osborn, a University of Utah
professor of pediatrics.
   "The state can't tell me to do something that may be
harmful to my child," counters Elisa Leavitt, a Boca Raton,
Fla., housewife. She lobbied for a parents-initiated state
bill to allow exemptions to shots on philosophical grounds.
In Arizona, where 400 whooping-cough cases in 1989 led to
legislation requiring written medical confirmation of shots
for public school children, an anti-shot parent group,
Arizona Citizens for Health Education, got an amendment to
the bill requiring the state's exemption rights to be posted
in schools.
   And a Vienna, Va.-based group, Dissatisfied Parents
Together, lobbied successfully for laws in Maryland, West
Virginia and New Jersey requiring the vaccine's risks to be
disclosed to parents, and for a federal law requiring the
U.S. to issue soon a pamphlet on benefits and risks.
   New efforts are expected in states where pertussis
inoculation rates are dropping. In Utah in 1988,
whooping-cough immunizations among two-year-olds fell to 59%
from 78% between 1980 and 1985 and nearly a third of
non-immunizing parents expressed concerns about the vaccine.
   Lately, some academics have stepped up efforts to debunk
previous studies strongly linking the pertussis shot to brain
damage or death. But some of those opposed to the vaccine
counter that academic experts on the other side often are
being paid as consultants by pertussis vaccine makers. They
assert that these days the disease is milder and less life
threatening and that proper sanitation and nutrition provide
immunity enough from whooping cough, a disease that in
extreme cases ruptures small blood vessels in the brain.
   By most measures the vaccine, developed in 1906, is crude;
it includes the whole, killed pertussis organism and its
powerful toxins, not just immunity-producing antigens. A 1981
study by the University of California at Los Angeles showed
that one in 1,750 children will suffer a convulsion after the
shot, a reaction rate termed "extraordinarily high" by UCLA
neurology and pediatrics specialist Ronald S. Gabriel.
Another study, at New York's University of Rochester, found
some type of negative reaction, perhaps minor but still
measurable, in 80% of children vaccinated. In a sense,
Congress acknowledged the shot's risks in 1986 by authorizing
an excise tax on shot sales to create a trust fund for
parents of victims of negative reactions to the vaccine. (So
far, $50.1 million has been dispensed in 77 cases.)
   Also, the vaccine only takes hold in 70% to 90% of
children, and because it can't be administered after the age
of seven, immunity wears off in the early teens. In 1988,
Arizona health authorities found that of children one to four
years old contracting whooping cough, 71% had received some
or all their pertussis shots.
   "This shot is not ideal," says Douglas Reynolds, vice
president, marketing, of Connaught Laboratories Inc., a
Swiftwater, Pa., DPT vaccine maker. But he says it's unclear
what's needed for a better, cost-effective vaccine.
   One alternative Japanese vaccine was found by a University
of Rochester researcher to be more effective and to cause
negative reactions in only 5% of babies. Lederle
Laboratories, a unit of Wayne, N.J.-based American Cyanamid
Co., the vaccine's largest maker, says it hopes to market a
Japanese shot. But the National Institutes of Health, which
is launching a four-year clinical trial on safer shots, says
none will be available for several years.
   That angers Art Kline, who recently stopped immunizing his
32-month-old daughter and 13-month-old son with a pertussis
vaccine he calls a "medical time bomb." Says the Dallas real
estate agent: "I am confused, angry and scared. I have two
beautiful babies. . . . They deserve a questioning, probing
parent." The chances of their getting whooping cough, he
says, are "so remote, it's not worth my injecting toxins into
their bodies. I don't know that what I am doing is a threat
to the public health."
   Barbara Shepherd, a De Land, Fla., free-lance journalist
who immunized her children for diphtheria and tetanus but not
pertussis, agrees, even though her youngest child got
whooping cough last year. "Not immunizing has been the
toughest child-raising decision I have made." But, she adds:
"We have gone overboard with medical technology. We give {the
vaccine} to our kids blindly, even if the disease isn't life
threatening."
   Phoenix, Ariz., mother Lisa Regalado doesn't agree. Two
months ago Ms. Regalado's one-week-old baby, Cristina, began
to cough. Her mother's touch sent her into bronchial spasms,
and laying her down caused her to turn blue. At four weeks,
Cristina's lungs broke down and her heart stopped. "I think
all children should be vaccinated. Parents should not have
any choice," Ms. Regalado says.

   CHICAGO -- Helene Curtis Industries Inc., its earnings
hurt by new-product spending and a strategy that seeks to
boost market share through price cuts, reported a fiscal
first-quarter loss, despite a 22% sales increase.
   For the quarter ended May 31, the maker of personal-care
products had a net loss of $1.8 million, or 20 cents a share,
compared with year-earlier net income of $2.2 million, or 24
cents a share. Sales rose to $195.1 million from $160.2
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company attributed much of the sales increase to the
recent introduction of its Degree antiperspirant/deodorant,
as well as "continued gains by our U.S. consumer brands and
strong performances by hair-care products in Japan and
Canada."
   Helene Curtis said its "strong" domestic business reflects
increased market share in hair-care products, and said the
more than 20% sales rise in its Suave line "underscores the
effectiveness of our strategy of lowering this brand's prices
by 10% last year to reinforce its position."
   The company said that, as it had projected, higher
marketing expenses and capital layouts aimed at boosting
manufacturing and distribution cut into earnings. And it
reiterated that it "will be difficult for us to match our
fiscal 1990 earnings performance in 1991."
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Helene Curtis shares dipped 50 cents to $25.125.

   Allegheny Ludlum Corp. told securities analysts that its
markets, except for automotive, are strong and that orders
are 25% ahead of its 1990 plan.
   In the current fiscal second quarter, ending July 2, the
company said shipments should be up at least 10% from the
year-earlier's 126,419 tons. In the 1989 second quarter the
company earned $36.7 million, or $1.63 a share.

   However, the Pittsburgh specialty steel producer said it
expects sales in the latest quarter to decline from $333.8
million a year ago, citing the absence of raw material
surcharges.
   "We are surprised at the strength in the market. Our
backlog is growing, exports are turning up, and the third
quarter is looking much stronger than anticipated," the
company said.

   Rule of Law:
   Lawyers Make Frivolous Arguments at Their Own Risk

   There is a phrase even more horrifying to trial lawyers
than Case Dismissed. This is Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. What sounds like a technicality is the
country's most effective deterrent against frivolous cases.
It hits abusive lawyers where it hurts -- in the pocket.
There's even a former attorney general among the errant
lawyers fined under this rule.
   The adoption of a toughened Rule 11 by the courts in 1983
was a formal admission that litigation was out of control.
The rule says judges "shall" assess fines on lawyers who file
court papers that are not "well grounded in fact" or
"warranted by existing law" or are "to harass," "cause
unnecessary delay" or "needless increase in the cost of
litigation."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wags may say this covers most cases, but it wasn't until
this term that the Supreme Court issued detailed opinions on
Rule 11. In one case, the court said only the lawyer who
signs the offending legal paper is liable, not his law firm.
The second case, earlier this month, bashed lawyers for a
menswear business who filed a frivolous class-action
antitrust claim against Hartmarx as part of a contract
dispute. The court said the lawyers were liable for $21,000
even though they had withdrawn the lawsuit. In an 8 to 1
opinion, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor rejected the argument
that Rule 11 "chills creative litigation." She said trial
judges need the discretion to punish lawyers as a way of
"curbing abuses of the judicial system."
   This comes after the justices in May refused to hear the
appeal of former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who faces a
not-yet-determined fine. Mr. Clark, who served under
President Johnson, represented Libyans who sued President
Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher for their role in the 1886
bombing of Muammar Qadhafi's headquarters. Guess the alleged
offense? Mr. Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher were accused of being
RICO racketeers.
   Not too surprisingly, the trial judge found that the "case
offered no hope whatsoever of success, and plaintiffs'
attorneys surely knew it." The appeals court in Washington
insisted on a fine, saying that "we do not conceive it a
proper function of a federal court to serve as a forum for
`protests,' to the detriment of parties with serious disputes
waiting to be heard."
   Politics and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law make a heady brew for Rule 11. The Christic
Institute RICOed a long list of defendants, including retired
Gen. John Singlaub, for running drugs, committing murder,
etc., and helping the Nicaraguan Contras. Federal Judge
Lawrence King of Florida last year said the case was
"unsubstantiated rumor and speculation from unidentified
sources." He ordered Christic and its chief
conspiratorialist, Daniel Sheehan, to pay $1 million toward
the defendants' legal bills.
   Radical lawyer William Kunstler, a lawyer from a Christic
affiliate and a law professor were fined $120,000 last year.
Part of their defense of two Indians who took hostages in a
North Carolina newspaper office was to accuse top state
officials of various civil rights offenses and allege that a
sheriff ran drugs. Judge Malcolm Howard called it all
frivolous, "not to vindicate constitutional rights, but more
probably to gain publicity."
   Political cases aside, many Rule 11 sanctions are to
punish efforts to coerce deep-pocket defendants to pay
something, anything, to be rid of a nuisance case. Last year
a law school graduate sued Capital Cities/ABC for $2 million
plus 1,000 shares. The firm's offense? Requiring him to buy a
surety bond before it replaced certificates for two shares he
lost worth $243.
   New York business law has long allowed firms to demand
bonds to indemnify against possible claims, but the plaintiff
said this amounted to "unconscionability" and even claimed
emotional distress. A New York court said this was
ridiculous, noted that the plaintiff had "a long history of
bringing baseless claims in a variety of forums," and fined
him $5,000.
   Here's another howler. In 1984, a lawyer sued San
Francisco for violating his free speech and equal-protection
rights when police officers stopped his softball game in an
off-limits part of a park. "Plaintiff does not allege any
facts suggesting communicative expression or symbolic conduct
sufficient to fall within the scope of the First Amendment,"
Judge William Schwarzer ruled. "There is no indication that
persons observing plaintiff playing softball in Golden Gate
Park would understand his conduct to be a message `about the
right to democracy in recreation as opposed to elitism.'" He
fined the plaintiff $50,000.
   Only a minuscule fraction of the 250,000 civil cases filed
each year in federal court (or in the 38 states with similar
rules) result in sanctions. Fordham law professor Georgene
Vairo found that in the four years ending in 1987, sanctions
were sought in some 700 federal cases and granted in just
over half. It's usually the plaintiff lawyer who's fined.
   Some critics of Rule 11 say it punishes cases that should
be brought. The New York Legislature threatens to suspend its
version of Rule 11 partly because of fears that worthy
arguments will be stifled. Last week, the New York State Bar
issued a report that proposes making the test "abusive
conduct" by lawyers instead of "frivolous conduct."
   It's a little hard to get worked up over the prospect of
chilling imaginative lawsuits. After all, it was legal
creativity stamped with approval by activist judges that got
us into this mess in the first place. For example, 30 years
ago it would have been frivolous and/or abusive to argue that
a defendant should be liable regardless of fault simply
because it's a big corporation. This "enterprise liability"
is now the law in many jurisdictions.
   The better argument against Rule 11 is that the barn door
is already closed. Who can know what case is frivolous? The
breakdown in American law makes it hard to say which legal
argument deserves to be punished -- and which some day will
be declared a winner by some judge somewhere. Remember the
$10 billion judgment against Texaco by Pennzoil?
   One sign that Rule 11 won't solve the problem is that
plaintiffs and defendants now often preemptively -- and
frivolously -- sue each other under Rule 11. There's an
alternative. Other common-law countries don't have frivolous
cases because they have the English rule on costs: Loser
pays. Litigants in non-criminal cases avoid high-risk
arguments for fear of having to pay the winner's legal costs.
Maybe critics of Rule 11 should join the bandwagon in the
U.S. to switch to the English rule.

   Court Rejects Appeal
   By Mission Reinsurers
   Over Future Claims

   SAN FRANCISCO -- A California appeals court upheld a
ruling by the state's insurance commissioner that allows the
state's Department of Insurance to obtain lump-sum payments
of future policyholder claims from the reinsurers of Mission
Insurance Co.
   Mission and its units were declared insolvent and placed
in liquidation by California insurance regulators in February
1987. The appellate court ruling dismissed a challenge by
Underwriters Reinsurance Co., one of Mission's reinsurers, to
the state's demand that it pay claims for future damages
based on an industrywide actuarial method of calculating
expected future claims.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Claims costs that are not paid by reinsurers would be
passed on to the public through assessments by the California
Insurance Guarantee Association. There are no estimates of
what future claims might amount to; so far, however, the
state has collected more than $250 million on behalf of
California consumers.
   "This goes a long way towards ensuring that the public
will not have to pay for the mistakes of Mission and its
reinsurers," Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said.
"The reinsurers will no longer be able to drag their feet and
avoid paying balances due on the premise that my demand for
all damages, including those which will occur in the future,
is premature."

   NEW YORK -- New York City's largest public employee
pension fund said it sold shares valued at $563 million to
complete its divestment of stock in companies doing business
in South Africa.
   The $17.6-billion New York City Employees Retirement
System said the shares in 31 companies were sold in the final
phase of the divestment program begun in 1984. Shares valued
at $262 million in 44 companies with South Africa ties had
been sold earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The divestment program applied to almost 90% of the
system's $8.6 billion in stocks invested "passively" in an
index fund. A spokeswoman said the pension system's trustees
haven't decided if the South Africa divestiture retirement
should also apply to the $895 million in shares invested by
so-called active money managers.
   The public employee fund is the only one of New York
City's five pension systems to complete a South
Africa-related divestment program. The other city funds
either don't invest in stocks or have approved divestment
programs without implementing them.

   Things are bad all over in real estate. But developers and
real-estate executives say Donald Trump's problems aren't
necessarily typical.
   Mr. Trump's current struggles, they say, are as much a
product of his special circumstances as of conditions in real
estate. Other real-estate moguls don't have casinos causing
them cash-flow problems, or a high profile that puts their
struggles under a microscope.

<TEXT>
   That isn't to say there aren't other developers who are
hurting because their own optimism turned out to be
excessive. In general, those who have taken the biggest risks
in recent years have reaped the slimmest rewards. The Wall
Street Journal captured these portraits of where some major
developers stand today.
                                                                                                       

   JOHN C. PORTMAN JR.
                                                                                                       

   John C. Portman Jr. at Portman Cos. shows few signs of
slowing down, in contrast to the Atlanta real-estate market.
   The 65-year-old Mr. Portman, who gained international fame
in the 1960s as an innovator in hotel design, last month
opened Shanghai Center in China. The development includes
hotel, office, housing and retail space plus a theater and
exhibition hall. Last weekend, the San Francisco Fashion
Center, a 750,000-square-foot apparel market, opened.
   Locally, Portman Cos. is developing the Atlanta Gift Mart,
a 1.5 million-square-foot facility with showrooms for
gift-industry wholesalers, scheduled to open in 1992. The
developer's most ambitious project: a planned 60-story office
tower at Peachtree Center in downtown Atlanta. The $300
million building, with 1.2 million square feet of space, also
expected to be completed in 1992.
   Despite his successes in past years, Mr. Portman isn't
without his detractors in Atlanta. With office vacancy rates
here hovering at almost 20% and some 7.5 million square feet
of office space currently under construction, some industry
consultants question whether Mr. Portman will be able to find
enough tenants to fill his 60-story tower.
   Mr. Portman wasn't available for comment, but others say
such concerns may be overblown. Leigh Burch III, vice
president at Jamison Research Inc., a real-estate research
firm in Atlanta, expects businesses to absorb about 3.3
million square feet of office space a year through 1995. He
also says vacancy rates in the 1990s for top-of-the-line
buildings should be slightly below what they were in the late
1980s.
   "John Portman is a person you never want to bet against,"
says Mr. Burch. "He's defied gravity."
                                                                                                       

   CAMPEAU CORP.
                                                                                                       

   Many analysts say Campeau Corp.'s real-estate holdings
have a positive net worth. But the company has given little
indication in the past year, partly because Canadian
disclosure requirements aren't as stringent as those in the
U.S.
   In one of the most spectacular rises and falls in the
ranks of the real-estate moguls, Robert Campeau, 66-year-old
chairman and chief executive officer of Campeau Corp., is on
the brink of losing both the company he built up over 30
years and, possibly, his personal fortune. His highly
leveraged $10.2 billion acquisitions of Allied Stores Corp.
in late 1986 and Federated Department Stores Inc. in May 1988
ended in Chapter 11 filings in January and have endangered
the Toronto-based parent company.
   Campeau Corp.'s annual results, due to be released this
week, are expected to show massive write-downs of Campeau's
equity in Federated and Allied. In an effort to stave off
bankruptcy, the company has put up for sale most of its
real-estate holdings, which include prime properties in
Canada. But many analysts say Campeau may have a hard time
getting good prices because the market has softened and he is
in a must-sell situation.
   Mr. Campeau, who declined to comment for this article,
faces lawsuits by two banks over $39.2 million Canadian
dollars (US$33.3 million) of personal loans. They have court
approval to seize his assets. He reached an agreement with
the National Bank of Canada to repay C$153 million of debt at
52 cents on the dollar and recoup Campeau securities the bank
seized from him in January. But he needs to come up with C$40
million by the end of this month to get the stock back, which
would return his stake in Campeau to 43% from 21% currently.
To date, Mr. Campeau hasn't indicated that he has financing
for that transaction, nor has he reached similar agreements
with the other two banks.
                                                                                                       

   MORTIMER ZUCKERMAN
                                                                                                       

   "We have skirted the problems that a lot of other people
got into," says Mortimer Zuckerman, chairman of Boston
Properties Inc. and owner of the Atlantic magazine and U.S.
News &amp; World Report.
   His closely held company has recently built what he calls
some "low-margin" properties for the federal government in
Washington. "We stopped building on spec three years ago,"
Mr. Zuckerman says. As a result, he says, his company has
just a 2.5% vacancy rate, "no empty buildings and no land to
carry."
   Industry executives estimate that Boston Properties owns
12 million square feet of space worth several billion
dollars. Mr. Zuckerman says all of its financing is with
overseas banks, mostly in Japan. He says none of those loans
have had to be renegotiated.
                                                                                                       

   OLYMPIA &amp; YORK
                                                                                                       

   Soft real-estate markets have undoubtedly affected the
fortunes of Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., the real-estate
concern closely held by the Reichmann family of Toronto.
   Olympia &amp; York owns about 30 million square feet of office
space in the U.S. Three-quarters of that is in Manhattan,
which makes it New York's largest commercial landlord. It
also has prime office buildings in Toronto.
   Analysts can't get an accurate fix on Olympia &amp; York's
financial health, mainly because it is closely held. The
Reichmann brothers -- including Paul, 59 years old, seen as
the company's dealmaker and strategist -- shun publicity.
   In one of the few public research reports on the Reichmann
empire, Dominion Bond Rating Service of Toronto recently
estimated that its investment portfolio of public companies
in real estate, energy, natural resources, financial services
and transportation has a market value of more than 6.6
billion Canadian dollars (US$5.6 billion). No one, other than
the Reichmanns, some Olympia &amp; York officials and perhaps
some banks, knows to what degree the company's real-estate
operations are leveraged, but Dominion Bond Rating expects
that its assets easily exceed its debt load.
   John Zuccotti, president and chief executive officer of
Olympia &amp; York's U.S. unit, Olympia &amp; York Cos. (U.S.A.),
says the company is "doing quite well" given the soft
real-estate market in New York and other U.S. cities where
the Reichmanns own office buildings.
   In Manhattan, Olympia &amp; York doesn't have "all its eggs in
one basket," Mr. Zuccotti says. The West Side is in a "very
soft market," but Olympia &amp; York's holdings are mainly on the
East Side, where rents are more stable, he says. "We're
turning over leases at market rents," Mr. Zuccotti says,
though he adds that market rents aren't what they were four
years ago.
   Despite Wall Street's problems, the World Financial
Center, the company's premier newer property in downtown
Manhattan, is virtually fully leased, the company says. (One
tenant there is Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of this
newspaper.) One Liberty Plaza, recently renovated, is about
96% leased.
   At the World Financial Center, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. gave
back 500,000 square feet, but most of that has been leased,
Mr. Zuccotti says. He says 60 Broad Street, where Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. recently vacated 700,000 square feet, is
"a problem," but adds that Olympia &amp; York is working on three
or four leases to rent the space.
   Mr. Zuccotti says that after being cautious in the flat
New York market over the past four years, Olympia &amp; York is
prepared to begin "building into an up market in 1994-95."
   The company's biggest challenge is its massive Canary
Wharf development in London, where it is building what the
Reichmanns hope will be the city's second financial district.
   While work proceeds on the #4 billion ($6.86 billion), 12
million-square-foot development, London faces a glut of
office space and an economy sapped by inflation and high
interest rates. Only five major tenants have leased space in
Canary Wharf so far; just over 35% of the project's first
phase, which comprises 4.5 million square feet and is due for
completion in 1992, has been leased.
   But Mr. Zuccotti says there is a strong likelihood that in
the next six months, Olympia &amp; York will announce a
"substantial" number of long-term leases that will help it
reach "critical mass" for the first phase.
                                                                                                       

   CHRISTOPHER H. COLE
                                                                                                       

   Before the Phoenix, Ariz., market collapsed, 37-year-old
real-estate syndicator Christopher H. Cole and his wife,
Sonia, drove matching Rolls-Royces and lived in a swank home
adjacent to the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Arizona Biltmore.
   Today, they've sold their home and traded in the Rollses
for a Ford Bronco. "This is not a game," says Mr. Cole. "It's
been a sad and difficult kind of thing."
   Since Phoenix real-estate prices turned down in late 1987,
the market value of 11 downtown commercial sites owned by Mr.
Cole's partnerships has dropped to about $30 million from $70
million, according to Robert Kammrath, whose real-estate
research firm was familiar with the properties. Says Mr.
Kammrath: "His win streak has come to an end."
   In March 1989, one of his partnerships defaulted on a $24
million loan from Southwest Savings &amp; Loan, Phoenix, on one
of the downtown sites. Late last year the partnership filed
for bankruptcy protection.
   Mr. Cole -- who doesn't dispute Mr. Kammrath's estimates
of the changing value of his downtown properties -- is
struggling to hang on to the parcels, hoping for the market
to pick up again.
   Before getting involved in the downtown acquisitions in
the mid-1980s, Mr. Cole had benefited from from several
lucrative transactions in the nearby Scottsdale area,
including one purchase that brought a Cole partnership about
$30 million in profit on a $20 million investment.
   Mr. Cole planned to resell the downtown parcels to
developers, or perhaps to develop them himself as high-rise
sites. He planned his investments after spending "hundreds of
thousands on research," he says. Ron Bookbinder, a
real-estate broker who helped arrange most of Mr. Cole's
purchases, says, "His plan was to buy up and control all the
major sites. But he became a victim of the overbuilding of
Phoenix." Brokers today say the city's glut of office space
may not be absorbed for five to seven years.
   Mr. Cole says he plans to stick it out. He has kept most
of his partnerships together, convincing investors that it's
in their best interests to wait out the market, too. "I
haven't thrown in the towel, and I won't," says Mr. Cole. "I
had a perfect track record going into this. All of my deals
made a profit."
                                                                                                       

   ROUSE CO.
                                                                                                       

   Rouse Co. has modified its strategy, hoping to avoid some
of the pitfalls that come with the current real-estate
downturn.
   The developer, known for such projects as Manhattan's
South Street Seaport, Baltimore's Harborplace, Miami's
Bayside and Portland's Pioneer Place, no longer goes solo on
major ventures. Instead, Rouse now seeks out a joint-venture
partner to share financing costs. Though this approach may
defer and reduce profits somewhat, it reduces risks for the
company, says Catherine Creswell, a real estate analyst at
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons.
   In addition, Rouse has slowed the pace of new developments
and is now buying some existing commercial and industrial
properties where it can improve management, upgrade
facilities and lease the space to new tenants to attract
better retail business. It has agreed to buy the Salem Center
in Salem, Oregon, a regional shopping center with four
department stores and an additional 221,000 square feet of
space for small tenants. The company is also refurbishing
some of its existing malls to help them remain competitive
with retailing areas in the surrounding area.
   Rouse posted a loss of $603,000 for the first quarter,
compared with net income of $1.2 million a year earlier. But
its cash flow from its operating properties minus land sales
rose 19% to $14.1 million. The first-quarter loss stemmed
partly from a drop in land sales in the Baltimore-Washington
area, where the company has extensive holdings.
                                                                                                       

   TRAMMELL CROW
                                                                                                       

   Trammell Crow Co., like other national real-estate
developers based in Texas, has spent much of the past two
years restructuring debt and trimming operations.
   Earlier this year, Trammell Crow Co., which comprises the
office, retail and industrial development divisions of the
business founded by Trammell Crow, completed a $456 million
refinancing of several of its Southwest properties, the most
troubled in the company's $15 billion portfolio.
   The refinancing enabled the Crow company to pay off about
30 separate lenders and concentrate its debt with a longtime
financing partner, Equitable Real Estate Investment
Management Inc. Other Crow company debts are being
restructured, but the Equitable deal took care of the bulk of
the company's troubled properties.
   Trammell Crow is focusing its attention on an internal
retrenchment that involves closing some development offices,
consolidating its 90 divisional offices to fewer than 75 and,
most significantly, shifting emphasis from speculative
development to property management.
   "We're in a metamorphosis from doing deals to a management
business," says Trammell Crow managing partner J. McDonald
Williams. The change, he says, won't put the company at a
competitive disadvantage because "there aren't any other
people doing {speculative} deals."
                                                                                                       

   GALBREATH CO.
                                                                                                       

   Big Midwest real estate concerns don't have problems
similar to Mr. Trump's, both because they didn't take similar
risks and because Midwest real estate hasn't gone through the
same gyrations as in the Northeast and Southwest.
   "We've been pretty conservative, securing anchor tenants
and pre-leasing most of the space before we build," says
Daniel M. Galbreath, president of Galbreath Co., Columbus,
Ohio.
   Even so, his company is feeling the effects of speculative
building by other developers, which has depressed rents in
some areas, and of tighter credit. "The banks and savings and
loans are basically out of the market" for construction
loans, Mr. Galbreath says. "We are looking to pension funds,
overseas investors and other sources of financing." As a
result, there isn't a lot of new building, he says.
   "We have one suburban project that's a build-to-suit
situation," Mr. Galbreath says. "The tenants are already
lined up. But the lenders still want equity from us." That
and other demands have prevented an agreement on financing,
and the company hasn't started building yet.
   "Very high quality, pre-leased office building
construction still is going to be OK," Mr. Galbreath says.
"But there won't be much speculative building. Everyone in
the industry will have to tighten our belts." He says
Galbreath hasn't made layoffs among its permanent staff.
   Galbreath Co. also plans to do more construction for other
parties, either governmental agencies or major companies that
want a building for their own use. "Our primary thrust has
been to build where we have equity in the project," Mr.
Galbreath says. But with such situations more difficult to
finance, the company will do more contract building, he says.
                                                                                                       

   JMB REALTY CORP.
                                                                                                       

   Closely held JMB Realty Corp., the real-estate investment
giant headed by co-founders Neil G. Bluhm and Judd D. Malkin,
is widely considered to be in a strong financial position.
   The company's continued health in a turbulent real-estate
environment is due in large part to its access to
institutional funds, which reduces its dependence on borrowed
funds.
   JMB is "very well capitalized" and remains in a "very
solid position," says one institutional investment partner,
who asks not to be named.
   JMB's disciplined bidding posture is also said to be a
factor in its soundness. The company often considers bidding
when high-profile properties become available, but buys only
if it likes the price. Last year JMB was among those looking
at but not buying Campeau Corp.'s Bloomingdale's operation;
it made a multibillion-dollar bid for Hilton Hotels Corp. but
was rebuffed after it refused to raise its offer.
   But the company, one of the largest shopping-center owners
in North America and owner-operator of some giant commercial
properties, is willing to put its money down: JMB paid about
$2 billion for Toronto developer Cadillac Fairview in 1987
and $920 million in 1988 for Amfac Inc. of Hawaii. It also is
general partner in the limited partnership under which the
California Public Employees Retirement System last year paid
$398 million for a 20% stake in Santa Fe Pacific Corp.'s
real-estate holdings.

   In regard to Gene I. Maeroff's May 21 editorial-page
article, "Three Missing Keys to Public-School Reform":
Perhaps Mr. Maeroff has been addressing too many "major
value-laden obstacles to improvement." Certainly something is
wrong with his priorities.
   He is upset because a National Assessment of Educational
Progress (NAEP) survey indicates one out of five 11th-graders
do no homework. But neither Mr. Maeroff nor his fellow
fellows at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching are seemingly disturbed about NAEP reading scores
showing three out of five 11th-graders cannot read well
enough to do homework or schoolwork at the high-school level.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Maeroff thinks high-school students avoid tough
subjects such as physics and college algebra because they are
lazy, their parents are unsupportive and "peer pressure
denigrates scholarship." I think they don't take these
subjects because they can't read physics books and can't add,
subtract, multiply or divide fractions.
   In 1983, five million Soviet secondary students were
taking calculus. In 1986, five million U.S. high-school
students did not know that 87% of 10 is smaller than 10.
   More than 36% of our fourth-graders can't read, 40% of
seventh-graders can't read seventh-grade lessons written at
fourth- and fifth-grade levels. And 61% of the 11th-graders
can't read and understand ninth-grade lessons written at
sixth- and seventh-grade levels.
   Literacy is the missing key to U.S. public-school
education. And it has been missing for a very long time --
since the 1930s and 1940s when phonics teachers, who taught
children to read by matching sounds with letters that spell
sounds, began being replaced by "see and say" instructors,
who taught them to sight whole words by seeing them printed
over and over again. Nothing else explains the dreadful
disparity in the following sets of numbers and percentages:
   -- Only three to four out of 100 of the 18 million men
tested for military duty during World War II (1939-1945)
could not read.
   -- Seventeen out of 100 prospective recruits between ages
18 and 23 were rejected for illiteracy during the Korean War
(1950-1953).
   -- Three million Americans over 25 could not read in 1930,
1940 and 1950.
   -- Thirty million to 40 million American adults cannot
make sense out of a printed page today.
   Obviously, teaching all normal children to read in the
first two grades, just as we did before the introduction of
"see and say" instruction (most World War II nonreaders had
never been to school), should be first on a school-reform
agenda. Then see what else needs to be done.

   While many school districts across the country can
justifiably claim the need for increased funding, too much
emphasis has been placed on both revenue and reform.
   As a part-time teacher and tutor in the public-school
system and the father of three teen-agers, I believe Mr.
Maeroff's contention that there are two other "Rs" left out
of our debates is absolutely correct. Responsibility and
Respect for education and educators on the part of both the
student and the parent is the exception, not the rule, in
most schools today. What can come from academically sound
plans (reform) and increased funding (revenue) if the primary
recipient (student) lacks respect for the disseminator
(teacher) and the institution (school)? Furthermore, how will
the educational process improve if the primary authority
figure (parent) has not assumed the responsibility of
educational reinforcer?
   Placement of blame has yet to solve a problem. Before we
as adults, parents and business people begin "pointing the
finger of blame," let's make sure we have done all we can to
improve our own educational domain at home. Reform and
Revenue should always take a back seat to Respect and
Responsibility. Until they do, comparative educational
statistics will continue to show the U.S. in a poor light.

   Mr. Maeroff has put his finger on what is needed in U.S.
education today. Until scholastic achievement is more highly
valued than athletics and other extracurricular activities by
students and parents alike, all other prescriptions for the
ills of public education will continue to treat the symptoms
and not the disease.
   Fifty years ago, Marquette University sponsored an annual
competition in math proficiency for Milwaukee high-school
seniors. The top 10 in the written exams received modest cash
scholarship awards, but the real incentive for high-school
math departments was to place as many students as possible in
the top 10.
   I attended Milwaukee's Riverside High, where math teachers
searched out promising competitors with as much zeal as the
basketball coach sought out talent for a winning team.
Riverside High consistently had more winners than other
schools, attributable largely to the hard work of dedicated
math teachers who trained their proteges with as much
intensity as the best athletic coach.

   Flood of New Municipal, Asset-Backed Issues
   Hits Market as Buyers Avoid Some Tax-Exempts

   NEW YORK -- New municipal and asset-backed securities were
issued at a feverish pace yesterday with a combined total of
more than $3 billion in notes and bonds hitting the market.
   Dealers said the asset-backed securities were easily
absorbed yesterday, but some of the tax-exempt bonds met
strong investor resistance, as municipal-bond prices eased.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's a very tough market," said Frank Kenney, a vice
president in municipal bond underwriting at Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co.
   Traders said the lack of interest in municipal bonds
reflects growing concern that interest rates will rise as the
Federal government swamps the bond market with supply in the
weeks and months ahead. Some analysts believe the government
could raise more than $70 billion in the bond market during
the third quarter.
   Rather than buy bonds now, when the interest-rate outlook
is murky and investor sentiment has turned negative, some
investors have decided to wait and see what happens.
   "Buyers have put on the brakes, they have not taken the
aggressive stance that we saw in prior weeks," said Joe
Piraro, a municipal bond trader at First Chicago Capital
Markets. "The market participants are nervous. They can sense
that the flow is not like it was."
   The largest municipal offering yesterday was Los Angeles
County's $1.1 billion tax and revenue anticipation note
offering due July 1, 1991. The notes were priced by a group
led by Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. to yield 5.80% with a coupon rate
of 6.25%.
   In an unusual move, $100 million of 30-year industrial
development revenue bonds issued by Clark County (Nev.) on
behalf of Nevada Power Co. were repriced yesterday at a yield
of 7.88%. That was 1/4 percentage point higher than the
original 7.64% yield set on Monday.
   Underwriters at Goldman Sachs said the yield was adjusted
after Nevada Power decided to issue the bonds without
bondholder insurance. Typically, such insurance raises the
debt rating on an issue and thus lowers the issue's yield,
which results in substantial savings for the issuer. But in
recent days, the difference between yields on uninsured and
insured bonds has narrowed, said Goldman's Mr. Kenney.
Officials at Nevada Power said it was cheaper to issue the
bonds without insurance.
   The $1.5 billion of asset-backed securities sold yesterday
was just the beginning of an expected onslaught of such
issues.
   The largest of the three major asset-backed deals priced
yesterday was a $1 billion credit card-backed issue from
First Chicago Corp. that was sold globally by First Boston
Corp. and its European affiliate Credit Suisse First Boston
Ltd. Underwriters said the five-year securities, which were
priced at 99.91 to yield 9.271%, sold out quickly.
   Meanwhile, Norwest Corp. offered $400 million in
credit-card securities through Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. issued $95 million in securities backed
by mortgages on manufactured homes.
   Traders and analysts said that despite the heavy supply,
the securities were readily absorbed because they tap the
maturity ranges that are most eagerly sought by investors and
because there has been fairly light asset-backed issuance in
past weeks.
   "A lot of people in the asset-backed market are wondering,
`Can you absorb all this without driving spreads out?,'" said
Michael Basset, vice president at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates in Princeton, N.J. The supply coming soon will be
"something of a test for the market," he said.
   Whether the market can pass the test will be determined
very soon. At least three huge asset-backed issues totaling
$2.75 billion are expected later this week.
   Salomon Brothers Inc. said it plans to price $1 billion in
five-year Chrysler Co. securities backed by automobile loans
today. Citicorp is also expected to tap the global market
today with $1.25 billion of five-year credit-card backed
bonds. First Boston Corp. and Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd.
are expected to be lead managers.
   Also in the wings, a $500 million Chrysler Financing Corp.
issue will be lead-managed by Swiss Bank Corp. by early July.
The underwriter will kick off an international road show
today for the offering -- the first asset-backed deal to
package loans made to car dealers rather than car buyers.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of U.S. Treasurys fell again as concerns re-emerged
about the looming increase in government debt issuance and
skepticism about a near-term budget accord. Some analysts
believe the government will raise more than $70 billion
during the third quarter.
   The heavy load of new debt will begin next week when the
government sells new two-year and four-year notes.
   In early July, an issue of long-term bonds is expected
from the Resolution Funding Corp., the agency set up to
finance the thrift bailout.
   In trading, the benchmark 30-year bond fell about 1/4
point, or about $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
The benchmark bond was quoted late at a price of 102 27/32 to
yield 8.47%, compared with 103 2/32 to yield 8.46% on Monday.
The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of 102 11/32 to
yield 8.50%, compared with 102 15/32 to yield 8.48% on
Monday.
   Short-term rates were essentially unchanged. The discount
rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.74% for a
bondequivalent yield of 7.98%, while the rate on six-month
bills ended at 7.65% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.05%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds, called gilts, ended firmer
yesterday following two sharp back-to-back declines on Monday
and Friday.
   Bond-market analysts attributed the turnaround to comments
by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who said her
government will maintain its current tight monetary policy
and that "interest rates at 15% will succeed in bringing
inflation down."
   In trading, Britain's 11.75% securities due 2003/2007 rose
1/4 point to 101 28/32 to yield 11.47%. The 12% issue due
1995 rose 2/32 to 99 22/32 to yield 12.10%.
   Most West German bonds ended little changed. Dealers said
the market is likely to remain quiet ahead of July 1, when
monetary union between East and West Germany takes place and
the first of the German Unity Fund bonds will be sold.
   In Tokyo, the Japanese government bond market ended weaker
as bearish sentiment continued to spread.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Junk bonds, speculative-grade securities with low credit
ratings or no credit ratings at all, fell between 1/4 to 3/8
point.
   The notable exceptions to the broadbased decline were the
bonds of Trump Castle Funding Inc., which staged a partial
rebound from extremely low levels on the prospects that an
accord between Donald Trump and his banks is imminent.
   Trump Castle's 13.75% first mortgage bonds advanced 1 5/8
points to 58 1/2 on the American Stock Exchange while Trump
Castle's 7% issue gained 1 1/8 points to 36 1/2. Most other
Trump issues were unchanged to slightly lower.
   In the investment-grade corporate bond market, most bonds
finished unchanged to 1/8 point lower.
   Among new offerings, African Development Bank became the
latest so-called Yankee issuer to hit the U.S. debt market
when it sold $300 million of 10-year subordinated notes
priced to yield 9.37%. Yankee issuers are foreign companies
or agencies that sell dollar-denominated securities in the
U.S. capital markets.
   The African Development Bank issue was co-managed by
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. and Pryor, McClendon, Counts &amp; Co., a
black-owned underwriting firm. The offering represents the
first corporate debt deal Pryor McClendon has co-managed this
year.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities ended with slight losses.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
for July delivery were 5/32 lower on the day at 98 29/32 to
yield 9.79%.
   In the area of real estate mortgage investment conduits,
Salomon Brothers Inc. priced a Federal National Mortgage
Assocation issue totaling $300 million that was backed by
Fannie Mae 10% securities.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, Ginnie Mae 10%
issues were 3/32 lower on the day at 101 3/8, Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were down 1/8 at 98 1/4
and Fannie Mae 9.5% securities were 1/8 softer at 98 3/4.

   I was struck by the drawing of Karl Marx's grave in your

good shape.
   Seven summers ago, I was in Edinborough, Scotland, for a
couple of days. Finding myself with a bit of free time, I
thought that I would pop into a handy bookstore and pick up a
copy of "Wealth of Nations." Not only could I not find a copy
after popping into many bookstores, but also I couldn't find
a bookstore proprietor who had ever heard of Adam Smith]

   Disappointed, I took another tack and was able to get a
line on where he was buried. I found the site and more
disappointment. The cemetery is tucked back off Holyrood
Street toward the palace end. It is nondescript, and though
Adam Smith's gravestone is legible, it is overrun with weeds.
It seems the Scots have forsaken their most, arguably, famous
contributor to the course of human events. Perhaps with Marx,
Lenin, Stalin, et al. being revisioned down, it's time to
refurbish Adam Smith's grave along with his image.

   Panel's Draft of Administrative Charges
   Against President's Son Neil Is Released

   WASHINGTON -- A House committee, on a day in which the
White House assailed Democrats for the savings-and-loan mess,
got its clearest look yet at the government's case against
President Bush's son Neil stemming from his involvement in a
failed Denver thrift.
   In a draft of administrative charges that are the basis
for actions being taken against Neil Bush, thrift regulators
said Mr. Bush, a former director of Silverado Banking,
Savings &amp; Loan Association, never told the board of a $3
million loan he received from Denver developer Kenneth Good.
At the same time, Silverado's board was considering releasing
Mr. Good from having to repay $8.5 million of borrowings
because of his financial difficulties. Mr. Bush abstained
from voting on that matter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Bush willfully breached his fiduciary duty to Silverado
Banking by failing to disclose" that information, said the
draft, which was released by the House Banking Committee. Mr.
Bush, an outside director, was never an operating officer of
Silverado. The charge is the most severe of three outlined in
the draft enforcement resolution.
   Mr. Good eventually defaulted on $31 million in Silverado
loans. The Office of Thrift Supervision declined to comment
on the draft, except to say thrift regulators lack sufficient
evidence to seek an order barring Mr. Bush from the thrift or
banking industries. Five former Silverado directors and
officers have consented to be barred from the industry.
   Instead, thrift regulators have Mr. Bush's case before an
administrative law judge, seeking a cease-and-desist order
that would prohibit Mr. Bush from engaging in unsafe banking
or thrift activities. The administrative law judge will
recommend any action to be taken against Mr. Bush to Timothy
Ryan, who is director of the thrift office and was special
counsel to President Bush's 1988 campaign.
   The enforcement resolution also contended that Neil Bush
should have abstained in votes approving loans to another
business associate, Bill Walters. Mr. Bush also failed to
disclose his business relationship with Mr. Good when
Silverado approved a $900,000 line of credit for the
developer, the resolution said. Mr. Bush couldn't be reached
for comment.
   In an appearance last month before the Banking Committee,
Mr. Bush said his links to borrowers who defaulted on loans
posed no conflict of interest. He said that while his
business partners invested in his oil and gas operations, he
didn't invest in their businesses and thus wouldn't benefit
by helping them obtain loans.
   At a 9 1/2-hour hearing yesterday, members criticized
regulators for failing to rein in Silverado sooner and
questioned a series of complex deals between Silverado
officers.
   One window into the attitude of Silverado's operating
officers toward its directors was a 1986 memo to Mike Wise,
former Silverado chairman, from the chief operating officer,
Richard Vandapool.
   "In 1986, you should reduce the number of directors to a
bare regulatory minimum, reduce the number of director
meetings to four each year and then let the executive
committee deal with monthly issues and requirements," it
said, referring to the board positions, including Mr. Bush's,
as "rubber-stamp directorships."
   At yesterday's hearing, Mr. Vandapool called the memo
"tongue in cheek" and said the board was actually expanded
later.
   Silverado, whose losses totaled roughly $1 billion, was
sold with another thrift to First Nationwide, the thrift
subsidiary of Ford Motor Co.
   Meanwhile, the White House pointedly tried to defend
President Bush from attempts to blame him or other
Republicans for the prolonged S&amp;L debacle. White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater launched the effort by urging
reporters to examine the roles of various Democrats.
   "I'm saying the Democrats have a big role in it. . . .
Take a look at {former House Speaker} Jim Wright and {former
Rep.} Tony Coelho and Mr. {Sen. Bob} Kerrey and some of his
Nebraska accounts and {Michigan Sen.} Don Riegle and {Arizona
Sen. Dennis} DeConcini -- take a look at all of them," Mr.
Fitzwater said. "If they want to make this a political issue,
we'll be glad to do it."
   Mr. Fitzwater also singled out former House Banking
Committee Chairman Fernand St Germain, saying, "I don't think
you hear any serious analysis of this problem that doesn't
point to Freddy St Germain and the changes that were made in
the banking laws back at that point." Former Rhode Island
Rep. St Germain was instrumental in the adoption of laws
deregulating the thrift industry but was defeated in the 1988
election after close ties to thrift lobbyists and other
questionable practices were exposed.
   Mr. Fitzwater said the White House's pique was stirred by
speeches by Sen. Kerrey, a Nebraska Democrat who has
questioned the administration's estimates of the cost of the
thrift bailout and has referred to Mr. Bush as "the S&amp;L
president." Each of the other lawmakers Mr. Fitzwater
mentioned has been tied to thrift executives in incidents
that have caused them political damage. But Mr. Kerrey hasn't
been accused of any improper action involving thrifts, and
Mr. Fitzwater didn't provide any examples, saying only that
reporters should look into it.
   Democrats reacted with outrage to Mr. Fitzwater's
suggestion that they are unfairly politicizing the thrift
issue, and they vowed to continue speaking out. Mr. Kerrey
said on the Senate floor that Democrats ought to become more
outspoken and not be "threatened by petulant statements by a
press secretary."

   Thomas said that the second-half outlook is uncertain but
that earnings for the year are expected to meet or exceed
1989 levels, adjusted for non-recurring gains.
   In 1989, Thomas earned $20.6 million, or $2.02 a share, on
sales of $436.6 million. Included were non-recurring gains of
$7.4 million, or 75 cents a share.
   In addition to the U.S. construction slowdown, Thomas said
it has been hurt by a construction trade strike in Canada
that has weakened demand for its lighting products. Also, it
said, it has been hurt by strong competitive pricing
pressures.
   However, the company said it has been increasing its
lighting sales and market share. It added that the compressor
and pump markets are buffering it somewhat from the cyclical
swings in the construction industry.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Thomas closed at $17, down $1.

   WASHINGTON -- Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin concluded an
unusual "minitrial" in Charles Keating's suit to recover
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association, saying, "It's up to me,
and I'm going to ponder it."
   After 30 days of testimony that looked at a small sample
of Lincoln's real estate developments and securities
investments, Judge Sporkin has three choices: He can uphold
the government's April 1989 seizure of the thrift, return the
thrift or order a full trial.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government and Mr. Keating remained fiercely at odds
yesterday as final arguments were heard over Mr. Keating's
suit challenging the takeover. Lincoln was the principal
subsidiary of Phoenix, Ariz.-based American Continental
Corp., of which Mr. Keating is chairman.
   Mr. Keating charged that incompetent regulators carried
out a "vendetta" against him and smothered Lincoln with
unfair regulation because it didn't operate like a
traditional thrift. The government says Mr. Keating and his
business colleagues crafted sham transactions that allowed
them to drain tens of millions of dollars from Lincoln that
was paid to American Continental and then to Mr. Keating and
his associates in salaries and dividends.
   Mr. Sporkin didn't indicate when he plans to make a
decision in the case.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Kansas City Evening News will
print its 27th and final edition today even though it was
making a profit, Publisher Stephen F. Rose announced.
   Mr. Rose blamed the newspaper's demise on city officials
who were forcing him to take its teen-age sales force off the
streets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We were forced to make a very painful decision, to go
down in history as perhaps the only paper to close while
making money," Mr. Rose said. "We simply wouldn't be making
any money if we had to convert to home delivery."
   Mr. Rose, who is president of a family-owned group of 18
suburban weekly papers called Sun Publications Inc., was the
sole investor in the Evening News, an afternoon tabloid.
   It was the second unsuccessful attempt to start a
metropolitan newspaper in recent months. Ralph Ingersoll II
launched the St. Louis Sun in September but closed that
afternoon tabloid in April, citing insufficient circulation.
   Mr. Rose said Kansas City, Mo., authorities had been
cracking down on the street sellers, including issuing a
ticket to one and forcing others to move off street medians.
City officials cited safety and traffic considerations.
   Apart from its street sales, The Evening News was sold in
news racks and stores. About 22,800 papers were sold when the
paper started May 14. Last week, Mr. Rose said, sales were
averaging about 15,000 copies a day.

   SECAUCUS, N.J. -- Jamesway Corp. said Arlie G. Lazarus
resigned as president and chief operating officer, effective
Aug. 3.
   The 52-year-old Mr. Lazarus, the discount-store operator's
No. 2 officer, said, "Since I have been president of Jamesway
for over 12 years, it is now time to move on to something
new."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Herbert Fisher, 68 years old, remains chairman and chief
executive officer of the company, which operates 132 stores
in the mid-Atlantic states. After Mr. Lazarus's departure,
Mr. Fisher will assume the duties of president and chief
operating officer until a successor is found, Jamesway said.
   In the year ended Feb. 3, Mr. Lazarus received cash
compensation of $552,590, compared with $569,357 for Mr.
Fisher, according to proxy material for the annual meeting
held June 4.
   "They've been a good team for a long time," Edward F.
Johnson, analyst at Prescott Ball &amp; Turben Inc. in New York,
said of Messrs. Fisher and Lazarus. Though not a strong
performer in recent years, Jamesway did stave off potentially
weaker performance in a highly competitive industry with many
troubled companies, Mr. Johnson said. But he added that
Jamesway might well do better with a new president.
   Jamesway's earnings declined in fiscal 1990 for the third
year in a row, despite higher sales. But the company said it
expects earnings in the current fiscal year, ending next Feb.
2, to exceed the $5.8 million, or 41 cents a share, earned on
sales of $855.1 million in fiscal 1990.
   Barry Rockland, senior vice president for finance, said
sales for stores open more than a year are expected to rise
this year, and expense control is tighter.

   Lofty Dividends of 3 Big Banks Give Pause

   NEW YORK -- When applied to bonds, the term "high yield"
meant junk. Does it mean the same thing when applied to bank
stocks?
   Shares of three New York City banking giants have been
beaten down so much in recent weeks that their dividends have
hit the stratosphere, posing a tempting speculation for
investors. Wall Street analysts are starting to talk about
the "high-yield" banks, what with Chase Manhattan and
Chemical Banking yielding more than 10% and Manufacturers
Hanover a shade over 9%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By just about any measure, those yields are at historic
highs. Chase and Chemical, for example, are yielding almost
seven percentage points more than the stocks in the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 index. Big banks in general offer higher yields
relative to the S&amp;P 500 than at any time in the past 20
years.
   You can get a higher yield buying the stock of one of
these three banks than you can by buying a certificate of
deposit from them. (Their one-year CDs are yielding between
8% and 8.5%.)
   As always, there's a catch. The stocks of these banks have
been driven down by fears of future losses from the current
unholy trinity of bank lending: real estate, highly leveraged
transactions, and loans to less-developed countries. If there
are further big losses lurking in the loan portfolios of the
banks, their stocks could fall even more, wiping out some of
the dividend return.
   "Yields wouldn't be this high if there weren't concern
about the dividend being cut," says Cheryl Swaim, a bank
analyst at Oppenheimer.
   "There must be a number of investors who believe the
dividends aren't safe under current economic conditions or
that federal regulators will change the rules under which
they can pay those dividends," says Mark Alpert, a bank
analyst at Bear Stearns.
   In fact, bank regulators already have proposed new rules
restricting dividend payments by banks. But Mr. Alpert and
many other Wall Street analysts believe that dividends at the
major New York banks are safe, though he isn't expecting big
dividend increases in the next year or so.
   Others, however, argue that the stock market is correctly
pricing bank stocks to reflect the possibility of a dividend
cut. Among the more vocal in this camp is James Grant, editor
of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and a longtime Cassandra
about the leveraging of America.
   "Chase and Chemical are right up there in the rankings of
banks committed to real estate, HLTs {highly leveraged
transactions} and Third World loans," says Mr. Grant. He says
he has sold short "a bourgeois amount" of Chemical stock,
hoping that the price will fall so he can buy back the stock
at a lower price.
   Mr. Grant isn't flatly predicting dividend cuts, but he
says the dividend rules proposed by the Federal Reserve Board
and the comptroller of the currency would make the payouts
less secure. The rules would significantly tighten the
restrictions on dividends that banks can pay to their parent
holding companies.
   In essence, both the current and proposed rules say that
banks can't pay out more in dividends than they earn in
profits. The new rules, however, would change the way profits
are calculated.
   In the past, provisions for anticipated future loan losses
weren't deducted from earnings as regulators figured them;
only the actual "charge-offs" were deducted. But when banking
companies report earnings to shareholders and the Securities
and Exchange Commission, provisions for loan losses are
deducted from earnings as soon as the provisions are made.
The regulators' new proposal would align the regulatory
accounting practices with SEC's. Had the rule been in place
in recent years, it could have severely reduced the banks'
dividends.
   Two aspects of the proposed rules work in favor of the big
bank holding companies, Mr. Alpert notes. First, the
proposals would apply only to banks, not their parent holding
companies, which actually pay the dividends to shareholders.
Even if one bank within a holding company had to cut its
payments to its parent, the parent could continue to pay
dividends with profits from other subsidiaries.
   Second, the rules wouldn't take effect until 1991, and
wouldn't force banks to recalculate their earnings for prior
years. That's important, because under both the current and
proposed rules, banks are allowed to pay dividends equal to
their current-year profits plus any retained earnings from
the previous two years. So the banks won't have to slash the
cushion obtained from 1989 and 1990 earnings figured under
the existing, less-stringent rules.
   The three "high-yield" banking companies express slightly
varying degrees of confidence in their dividends.
   Manufacturers Hanover believes its dividend is safe, a
spokesman says. He notes that the company's board yesterday
declared a regular quarterly dividend of 82 cents a share.
The spokesman said Manufacturers Hanover doesn't "see any
increases in the dividend in the near term," but added: "We
do not expect the new rules {by regulators} to have any
impact on our ability to pay the dividend."
   Chase Manhattan "doesn't foresee any problem maintaining
our dividend at our current level," a spokesman says. In a
recent filing with the SEC, Chase said the ability of its
largest bank subsidiary to pay dividends to the parent "is
likely to be severely impacted" under both current and
proposed rules. But, it added, "management expects the
company to continue to pay dividends on its preferred and
common stock from other sources," such as dividends from
other operating units.
   At Chemical, "we simply, as a matter of policy, don't
speculate about our dividend going forward," a spokesman
said. The spokesman pointed to a paragraph in Chemical's most
recent annual report saying that under current rules,
Chemical's bank subsidiaries could pay $459 million in
dividends in 1990, plus an amount equal to the units' 1990
profits. At current levels, Chemical pays $330 million a year
in dividends. Though the Chemical report describes the
regulators' proposed changes, it doesn't say how Chemical
might be affected.
   Bear Stearns's Mr. Alpert says Manufacturers Hanover has
the best balance sheet of the three but has "limited revenue
growth prospects." Chase, which is considering its second
restructuring in two years, "looks to be the most out of
control," he says. And Chemical is "the darkest horse among
the money center banks," with an attractive branch system
despite still-high levels of non-performing loans in Texas
and New Jersey.

   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A federal grand jury indicted the
retired head of the Food and Drug Administration's
generic-drug division on two counts of perjury in a
corruption scandal involving the division.
   The indictment accuses Marvin Seife of lying to government
investigators about meetings with generic-drug company
executives and about whether he let the executives buy him
meals, said U.S. Attorney Breckinridge Willcox.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The indictment was the latest development in a two-year
investigation of corruption in the generic-drug industry and
among its regulators.
   Mr. Seife, of San Antonio, Texas, retired Dec. 31 after 17
years as director of the generic-drug division, where he was
responsible for reviewing manufacturers' applications to
market generic drugs.
   According to the indictment, Mr. Seife in a sworn
statement to an FDA investigator falsely denied meeting with
two generic-drug company executives in 1987 to discuss FDA
matters. The indictment also alleges that Mr. Seife made a
similar false statement last year to a House subcommittee.
   The second count of the indictment charges that Mr. Siefe
lied to FDA investigators when he said he had never had meals
with the executives. The indictment alleges he accepted
numerous lunches, dinners and drinks paid for by generic-drug
companies.
   If convicted on both counts, Mr. Seife would face a
maximum of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.

   NEW YORK -- General Instrument Corp. reported that fiscal
first-quarter net income fell 29% because of a year-ago gain,
but results, excluding the special item, were "ahead of
plan."
   Revenue and earnings grew in General Instrument's biggest
business, cable-TV and satellite equipment, and in
specialized semiconductors used in microelectronics.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In wagering systems, profit declined because foreign
shipments of lottery equipment didn't match year-ago levels.
And the defense electronics business, producing radar warning
and surveillance equipment, was hurt by lower foreign orders
at the government systems unit. Dalmo Victor, another unit of
the defense electronics business that produces the same type
of equipment, is doing well, a spokesman said.
   Net for the first period ended May 27 dropped to $23.2
million, or 84 cents a share, from $32.5 million, or 96 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   Year-ago results include $10.3 million, or 30 cents a
share, of earnings from discontinued operations. In May 1989,
General Instrument sold its majority interest in Sytek Inc.
to the Hughes Aircraft division of General Motors Corp. Sytek
is a Mountain View, Calif., manufacturer of local area
networks, used to tie together personal computers.
   Also, shares outstanding declined 19% to 27.5 million,
from 33.8 million, because of a stock buy-back in August.
   Revenue climbed 9.8% to $379.5 million from $345.6
million.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
General Instrument's shares rose 50 cents to close at $35.75.
   Separately, General Instrument named Ronald A. Ostertag
president of its power-semiconductor division based in
Hicksville, N.Y. Effective Sept. 1, Mr. Ostertag, currently
senior vice president of operations for the VideoCipher
division, succeeds Christopher F. Sutphin, who retires early
next year.

   NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms fell slighly in the week that ended
yesterday.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold directly by
banks were flat to down slightly. The average yield on a
one-year consumer CD eased to 7.85% from 7.87%, while the
five-year CD average dipped to 8.09% from 8.11%, according to
an 18-bank survey by Banxquote Money Markets, an information
service here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While none of the banks in the survey offered a yield as
high as 9%, investors can still find consumer CDs at some
banks that yield that much or more.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold by leading
broker dealers were mixed. The average yield on six-month CDs
slipped to 8.17% from 8.27%, while the average for two-year
CDs remained at 8.30%, according to Banxquote.
   Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were
down slightly. The average yield on one-year jumbo CDs dipped
to 7.90% from 7.98%, while five-year maturities eased to
8.22% from 8.25%.
   "Because banks are now reducing their loan portfolios,
they are not hungry for cash in order to make new loans.
That's why they can afford to lower their CD rates," said
Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote. He said he expects the
pattern to continue for the foreseeable future.

   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said it could face a
fine of as much as $1 million following a conviction on
conspiracy and bribery charges related to the sale of Coke to
a U.S. Navy base.
   In February, the Justice Department issued an 11-count
indictment against a Coca-Cola bottling unit, Mid-Atlantic
Coca-Cola Bottling Co., on charges related to the sale of
soft drinks at the Navy operations base in Norfolk, Va. The
indictment also charged that illegal gratuities were paid to
a former civilian U.S. Navy procurement officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Two weeks ago, a federal court in Norfolk found
Mid-Atlantic guilty of all 11 counts under the indictment. In
a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Coca-Cola
Enterprises said it may appeal. Sentencing is set for Aug. 3.
   The indictment, covering sales in 1984 and 1985, also
named Michael A. Hedges, a former Mid-Atlantic area vice
president, sales, and James J. Valerio, a former Mid-Atlantic
area controller.
   Before the trial, Mr. Hedges pleaded guilty to two counts
of paying illegal gratuities, according to the SEC filing.
Mr. Valerio was acquitted of a charge of conspiracy, the
filing said. Mr. Hedges couldn't be reached for comment.
   Coca-Cola Enterprises, a bottling business formed in 1986,
is 49%-owned by Coca-Cola Co. Coca-Cola acquired a
controlling interest in Mid-Atlantic in September 1984,
subsequently turning over its ownership of the business to
Coca-Cola Enterprises.
   Coca-Cola officials couldn't be reached for comment.

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Agriculture Committee voted to
spare the nation's dairy farmers from any further cuts in
dairy price supports over the next five years.
   The panel agreed to make the current milk support price --
$10.10 for each 100 pounds -- the five-year floor price for
milk producers. They would allow for adjustments in the
support price as government-owned dairy surpluses fluctuate
in size, but in no case could the support price fall below
$10.10.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But committee members rebuffed their chairman, Democratic
Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, by voting to prohibit the
government from undertaking another massive buy-out of dairy
herds to control surpluses of butter and other dairy
products.
   Disenchantment with the $1.8 billion whole-herd buy-out in
the mid-1980s -- also known as the dairy termination program
-- was so great on the committee that even Democrats deserted
Sen. Leahy in the 16-2 vote yesterday. Only Republican Sen.
Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, a major dairy-farming state like
Vermont, took his side.
   The amendment was advanced by Sens. Max Baucus (D., Mont.)
and David Boren (D., Okla.), who both represent major beef
cattle-raising states, and it was strongly supported by the
National Cattlemen's Association and other farm groups.

   FOOTHILL GROUP Inc., Los Angeles, said its Foothill
Capital Corp. unit completed a $50 million private placement
of senior notes, together with a related $50 million in
interest rate swap agreements designed to make the company's
interest obligations vary with market rates. Foothill, a
commercial lending and leasing concern, said the notes
consist of $15 million of 10.18% senior notes, due June 1993;
$15 million of 10.23% senior notes, due December 1993; $5
million of 10.27% senior notes, due June 1994; and $15
million of 10.35% senior notes, due June 1995. As a result of
the interest rate swap agreements, the company will pay a
variable interest rate tied to commercial paper rates.
Proceeds from the placement will be used to repay short-term
debt.

   NEW YORK -- The first leg of a court-ordered sale of the
art and coin collections of William Herbert Hunt and Nelson
Bunker Hunt met with considerable success last night.
   At Sotheby's Holdings Inc.'s New York auction house, there
was brisk demand for the one-time Dallas billionaire
brothers' collections of Greek and Roman antiquities. Bidding
for the roughly 2,000-year-old marble statues, bronzes and
vases came from private collectors and museums, and many of
the pieces sold for double their pre-sale estimated prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The total for the sale was $11.4 million. Sotheby's had
expected it to fetch $5 million to $7 million.
   It was good news for the Hunt brothers, whose businesses
are now in bankruptcy proceedings. In an unusual arrangement
with the bankruptcy trustees and creditors, the brothers
stood to gain if the sales were a success.
   If the total raised exceeds a certain amount yet to be
determined by the court, the Hunts will receive a portion of
the remainder as compensation, according to R. Carter Pate,
trustee for the Nelson Bunker Hunt liquidating trust. The
brothers spent time helping to sell the collection through
interviews and at receptions Sotheby's has hosted worldwide.
   All told, Sotheby's estimates that the three-day series of
sales will fetch about $20 million.

   LOS ANGELES -- Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. sued an insurer for
allegedly refusing to pay for its defense against a flurry of
investor lawsuits filed this year.
   In a complaint filed in state court in Los Angeles,
Saatchi asserts that a directors' and officers' liability
policy issued by New Hampshire Insurance Co. provides for
payment of defense costs of the suits now pending in federal
court in Los Angeles but that the insurer has declined
payment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suits, filed by holders of Saatchi's American
depositary receipts, allege that Saatchi and its officers
artificially inflated the market price of the receipts, which
represent shares in London-based Saatchi, and that they
failed to disclose the giant advertising firm's difficulties
in digesting a series of acquisitions.
   Saatchi's suit seeks a declaration that New Hampshire
Insurance must pay for defense of the investor suits and asks
at least $100,000 in damages.
   Officials of New Hampshire Insurance, based in Manchester,
N.H., couldn't be reached for comment.

   TSR Inc. said it expects to post pretax profit of $760,000

for the year.
   TSR, a Hauppauge, N.Y., computer software and

unit of American Express Co., will exercise an option to end
TSR's management contract for data processing services a year
early. TSR will receive about $500,000 for the management
contract through August 1991, its scheduled expiration.

   It also will receive the fair market value for certain
equipment of its data center facility, which it will turn
over to American Express Bank. A spokesman for American
Express said the move was related to cost savings.
   James Hughes, TSR vice president, said the company paid
about $3.5 million for the equipment several years ago. As a
result of the transactions, TSR said it expects to receive
$1.3 million, which will be recognized in the fiscal first
quarter. Because of this and losses in TSR's continuing
operations in consulting, it said it expects to post
"significant losses" for the remaining three fiscal quarters.
Those losses will more than offset the income recognized in
the first quarter, TSR said.

   SYDNEY, Australia -- May data showed demand in the
Australian economy continued to slow, but the effects were
uneven among sectors, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the
central bank, said.
   In its latest bulletin, the central bank said it
"continued its recent policy of keeping monetary conditions
steady" during May. The government and Reserve Bank eased
interest rates in three steps between January and April,
after nearly two years of pushing rates up, but have declined
to lower rates further until they see clear signs of slower
imports and inflation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Arguing that "quarterly figures tend to be volatile and
sometimes misleading," the central bank put aside
consideration of national accounts issued for the quarter
ended March 31, which showed an unexpected 1.8% expansion in
gross domestic product. It said private final demand in the
economy "was flat and investment {was} falling."
   Balance-of-payments figures for March "offered
disappointing evidence on the strength of imports and the
size of the current-account deficit," the bank said. But
"April's results . . . supported the belief that reduced
domestic demand would feed into lower demand for imports."

   Sabena, the Belgian flag carrier, posted a 1989 operating
loss of 1.26 billion Belgian francs ($36.6 million), compared
with 1988 operating profit of 1.19 billion francs.
   Officials of the 53% state-owned airline predicted a 1.5
billion-franc loss for 1990, mostly because of costs
associated with building up the Brussels airport as a
transfer point for European flights. Sabena attributed last
year's poor performance to disrupted services to Zaire,
air-traffic control strikes in Europe, and a work stoppage by
Sabena flight attendants.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Sabena had 1989 net income of 658.1 million francs,
owing to extraordinary gains from sale of an aircraft and
goodwill payments from two new investors, British Airways and
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. In 1988, Sabena earned 334.7
million francs.
   Revenue in 1989 eased to 41.9 billion francs from 42.6
billion francs in 1988.
   One-time gains of 6.58 billion francs included five
billion francs total paid by British Airways and KLM as
goodwill for their 20% stakes in a new air-transport company,
Sabena World Airlines; Sabena, now a holding company, retains
60%.

"approximate 40 cents to 45 cents a share," or $1.6 million
to $1.8 million, up from 37 cents a share, or $1.4 million, a

   The company, based in Grand Rapids, Mich., said it expects
to report a one-time gain of $1 a share, or $3.9 million, for
the quarter. The gain reflects profit from the sale of a
factory in La Mirada, Calif.
</LP>

   The company said full-year earnings, before the gain,
should rise to $1.35 to $1.40 a share, or $5.3 million to
$5.5 million, from $1.31 a share, or $5.3 million, a year
ago. Sales are expected to rise about 8% and exceed $124
million, it said.
   Knape &amp; Vogt also said Allan E. Perry, 49 years old, was
named vice president, manufacturing, effective immediately.
Mr. Perry, formerly vice president and general manager of the
company's Modar subsidiary, succeeds Walter P. Knauss Jr.,
who left "to pursue other interests," the company said. Mr.

   The New Jersey Casino Control Commission said it will hold
a hearing July 24 to consider whether to change its rule
limiting "passive" institutional investing in casinos.
   Currently, anyone owning more than 5% of a publicly traded
casino company is subject to the commission's controls. But
representatives of the casino industry have said such a rule
restricts outside investment in their companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a statement, the commission's acting chairwoman,
Valerie H. Armstrong, said she doesn't believe the rule
serves as a disincentive to outside investment but said she
ordered the hearing "to allow the casino industry, the
investment community, the attorney general's office and other
interested parties an opportunity to be heard."

   JERICHO, N.Y. -- Getty Petroleum Corp. said the U.S.
Attorney's office in Brooklyn intends to seek indictments
against the company's Getty Terminals Corp. unit and an
executive.
   The independent gasoline marketer said the possible
indictments are related to an alleged conspiracy with a
customer to evade certain federal gasoline excise taxes in
1985.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The office of U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney advised the
company that the government intends to seek the indictments,
Getty said. Getty called the allegations without merit and
said that if it is indicted, it will vigorously defend
itself.
   Getty Petroleum, formerly Power Test Corp., was formed out
of the purchase of the Getty name, marketing assets, and
terminals from Texaco Inc., when the White Plains, N.Y., oil
giant bought Getty Oil Co. Getty Petroleum also markets
heating oil and is a wholesale distributor of a variety of
petroleum products through its East Coast petroleum storage
and distribution network.
   Spokesmen for Getty and Mr. Maloney's office couldn't be
reached for elaboration.

   Charter Consolidated PLC, a British industrial holding
concern, said pretax profit for the year ended March 31 rose
12% to #75.8 million ($129.9 million) from #67.7 million a
year earlier, as strong gains in its core mining and
industrial equipment activities offset a 24% lower
contribution from its 38% stake in the precious minerals
group Johnson Matthey PLC.
   Profit after taxes and minority interests rose 1.5% to
#46.1 million from #45.4 million. Earnings per share edged up
1.2% to 43.6 pence from 43.1 pence. After-tax earnings were
damped by a sharp rise in tax charges to #23.7 million from
#17.4 million paid in fiscal 1989, when the group benefited
from tax losses and deferred-tax credits. Net profit
attributable to shareholders after one-time gains increased
12% to #51.8 million from #46.3 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales rose 2% to #1.03 billion from #1.01 billion.
   An extraordinary gain of #5.7 million is chiefly the
balance of a #24.4 million profit on the sale of a
stockholding and a #20.6 million write-off on Johnson
Matthey's restructuring program. A year earlier, the company
had a one-time gain of #900,000.

   SIMSBURY, Conn. -- Kollmorgen Corp. said the final report
of the balloting in a proxy fight for control of the board
confirmed that the maker of motors and electro-optical
systems beat back a challenge by Vernitron Corp.
   But closely held Vernitron, a Deer Park, N.Y., maker of
motors and controls that has been pursuing Kollmorgen for
some 18 months, disputed the final report of the inspectors
of the election.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Vernitron said it "presented a number of significant
challenges to votes affecting hundreds of thousands of
shares." Vernitron "believes the inspectors {of the election}
erred in ruling with Kollmorgen management on these
challenges and is considering" taking legal action.
   Late in May, Kollmorgen said preliminary numbers indicated
that it won the proxy fight. Vernitron said then and
reiterated that its slate of directors won a plurality of the
shares voted at the meeting if the 3.1 million shares
Kollmorgen sold to an investor group in March are excluded
from the total. Vernitron has claimed that Kollmorgen sold
the 3.1 million shares to the investor group as a defensive
measure against Vernitron.
   Separately, the New York money manager Mario Gabelli
disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in
Washington that a company he controls boosted its stake in
Kollmorgen to 19.99% from 17.79%. The group to which
Kollmorgen sold the 3.1 million shares, which includes
Tinicum Enterprises Inc. of Garden City, N.Y., recently
boosted its Kollmorgen holdings to 19.5%.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Kollmorgen shares closed unchanged at $11.50.

   White House Mulls U.S. Participation
   In Effort to Shore Up Soviet Economy

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is reluctantly
considering U.S. participation in a multibillion-dollar
international effort to save the Soviet economy from a crash
that could undermine Mikhail Gorbachev and harm Eastern
Europe.
   The National Security Council is debating the conditions
under which the U.S. might take part in such a rescue plan,
which West Germany and France are pushing. The allies foresee
it totaling about $20 billion over one or two years. For the
U.S., the major issue is exactly how it could participate in
a way that encourages, rather than postpones, economic and
political changes in the Soviet Union. The White House is
planning to settle on a U.S. position in time for the July 9
economic summit meeting in Houston, at which the Soviet-aid
issue promises to be the dominant issue.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   American officials familiar with the international
deliberations caution that President Bush hasn't decided
whether the U.S. will join such a rescue effort. They add
that no Western plan is likely to be adopted in detail at the
summit or to begin operating soon thereafter. Instead, the
heads of the seven largest industrial nations are likely to
order lower-level officials to work out a program for
adoption later.
   But the administration, which has opposed direct Western
aid or financing for the Soviet Union, has concluded that the
meeting is likely to begin a process by which Western funds
and food will begin flowing to the U.S.S.R. this year.
American officials fear that unless the U.S. gets involved,
the Europeans will proceed on their own with an aid package
that would carry too few conditions and might help prop up
inefficient state-run enterprises. The U.S. officials would
prefer to assert American leadership over any Western effort.
   French President Francois Mitterrand yesterday publicly
declared for the first time that he will push to make aid to
the Soviets a top priority at both the Houston summit and a
coming Dublin meeting of the European Community.
   On Monday, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wrote a
letter to leaders of the EC, the U.S., Japan and Canada,
asking them to discuss in Houston and Dublin the question of
economic and financial cooperation with the Soviet Union.
Reached at home last night, a top aide to the chancellor
insisted that Mr. Kohl has made no recommendation for a
specific amount. "What we prefer is, first of all, a
discussion with our partners over whether it is in our best
interests to give such support and only then talk about
specifics," he said.
   Asked to comment on yesterday's statement by Mr.
Mitterrand, the State Department stuck to the current
official U.S. position opposing Western aid. It deliberately
avoided any mention of the high-level discussion about
changing the policy. "Neither the West nor the U.S.S.R. would
benefit from the extension of large-scale credits or
assistance," the statement declared.
   Administration officials are keenly aware that aid to
Moscow -- even such indirect measures as permitting U.S.
banks to lend the U.S.S.R. money -- would be politically
controversial at home. When House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt (D., Mo.) proposed such aid a few months ago, the
White House ridiculed the proposal and it got little support.
Mr. Gorbachev's campaign against Lithuanian independence has
complicated the political calculation.
   However, U.S. experts privately have concluded that the
Soviet economy, already faltering badly, could break down,
amplifying the country's political chaos dangerously. They
fear such a prospect -- especially a Soviet food crisis later
this year -- could swamp the current reform efforts and might
even topple Mr. Gorbachev, whose continued presence at the
helm is thought necessary to get Moscow's final agreement on
German unification and arms-control treaties.
   What's more, American officials fear that any Soviet
economic crash could badly undermine the new democracies of
Eastern Europe, whose own economies are still heavily tied to
Moscow's both for imports and exports. A politically
unpopular decision to aid Mr. Gorbachev thus might be made
palatable by posing it as indirect help for the popular new
regimes in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   Mr. Gorbachev raised the issue of possible Western
economic help in vague terms during his summit meeting with
President Bush here two weeks ago. But U.S. officials say
their discussion of the topic was general and didn't produce
any agreements or promises.
   The Bush administration is likely to insist on three broad
conditions before it will participate in any aid package.
   First, it wants guarantees that the Soviets will begin
implementing more fundamental economic reforms to create a
true market economy and that Western aid will bolster these
efforts directly. Some U.S. officials even see the Western
aid being used to flood the country with consumer goods as a
sweetener to help the Soviet public accept the economic
burdens of reform.
   Second, the administration wants the Kremlin to stop using
its money to prop up distant allies, notably Cuba. Otherwise,
the administration fears, Western aid simply would allow the
Kremlin to avoid the painful decision of cutting off Cuban
leader Fidel Castro and other clients.
   Moreover, the U.S. will want to see the economic crackdown
on Lithuania removed.
   In an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde, Mr.
Mitterrand warned that if Mr. Gorbachev's reforms fail, "the
rise of nationalism threatening the implosion of the Soviet
Union will set off a cycle of confrontation and violence
which will have grave international repercussions."
Therefore, he declared: "I intend to ask the forthcoming
summits in Dublin and Houston to consider financial,
commercial and technical aid for the U.S.S.R."
   Details of what a $20 billion package would entail are
sparse, partly because nothing has been decided.
   One component seems likely to be food, which might have to
be delivered by Western trucks or aircraft to the country's
interior to prevent it from being left to rot at docks and
depots because of the awful Soviet transportation system. A
second element is likely to be access to commercial credit,
though it's uncertain whether Western banks will be willing
to lend to a country behind on its payments and threatening
to splinter into a dozen separate republics. France and West
Germany also are pushing for some direct government credit,
though the U.S. is very wary of the idea.
   In the U.S., congressional approval might be required to
waive legal restrictions against aid and bank lending to the
Soviets, who still haven't repaid U.S. loans from earlier
periods.
   If the U.S. participates in an aid effort, the Bush
administration would want to carefully target the assistance
so that it encourages the Soviets to turn state-run
enterprises over to private hands. That has been a goal of
other American aid programs for new, non-Communist
governments. Some U.S. aid for Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, for instance, is earmarked specifically for
government firms that have plans for going private.

   OTC Focus:
   Stocks Ease Despite Rise on Big Board;
   Some Traders Predict Recovery Today

   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks eased despite a mild
recovery on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Traders say OTC investors held back from buying stocks to
see if Monday's weakness would resume.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But with OTC stocks registering only mild losses by the
session's end, some players are predicting that unlisted
share prices will recover today.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.26 point, or 0.06%,
to 460.53, while averages on the Big Board edged higher. The
NYSE Composite Index added 0.35%, while the Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 0.39%.
   OTC advancers led decliners, 1,036 to 932, while total
Nasdaq volume eased to 143 million shares from Monday's 157.6
million shares.
   George Jennison, co-manager of OTC trading at Wheat
First-Butcher &amp; Singer, says there are still plenty of
portfolio managers with sideline cash itching to turn that
money into stocks before the second quarter ends. That buying
could support unlisted stock prices through the end of the
month, he says.
   "I think you're going to see a recovery in OTC stocks"
today, says Mr. Jennison.
   But after the end of the quarter, concern will probably
grow over how much money companies earned in the quarter, Mr.
Jennison says.
   Analysts warn that recent economic data showing a
continued weakness in the economy could translate into
falling profits at some companies.
   While that may not hurt those stocks for which investors
are already expecting an earnings decline, a slump could
devastate stocks for which investors are betting on a rise.
And thinly capitalized OTC stocks often react more
drastically than others when earnings don't come in on line.
   "High growth expectations leave you susceptible to
disappointments, especially in an environment where we seem
to be getting negative signals out of the data," cautions
Claudia Mott, small-stock analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities.
   She warns that apparel retailers may be the most
vulnerable this time around.
   Ms. Mott tracks earnings expectations for about 800 stocks
with market capitalizations of $50 million to $500 million.
   Apparel retailers top the list of groups in which
investors are betting on a sharp rise in profits, she says.
But falling retail sales may mean those expectations are too
high, she adds. Retail sales fell 0.4% in March, 0.4% in
April and 0.7% in May.
   And Ms. Mott notes that earnings for apparel retailers
weren't exactly stellar in the first quarter, making a sudden
leap in growth rates all that more unlikely.
   Among apparel retailers for which analysts are expecting a
big second-quarter earnings rise are Deb Shops, Paul Harris
Stores and Jay Jacobs, Ms. Mott says.
   According to Ms. Mott, analysts are expecting Deb Shops to
earn about 32 cents a share in the second quarter, up from
only six cents a share a year earlier.
   Paul Harris is expected to earn about five cents a share,
compared with two cents a share in last year's second
quarter, she says.
   And analysts are looking for Jay Jacobs to earn 10 cents a
share, more than double the four cents a share earned in the
year-earlier quarter, Ms. Mott says.
   Deb Shops slipped 1/4 to 11 5/8, this year's low for the
stock. Paul Harris, which didn't trade yesterday, trades at
about 4, and Jay Jacobs added 3/8 to 9 3/4.
   Ms. Mott says strong earnings growth is also expected for
some technology stocks, particularly those in
computer-related industries. The group already saw its
earnings turn around in the first quarter, however, making a
strong second-quarter a safer bet, she says.
   Meanwhile, earnings of companies in financial services or
basic industries have been slumping for some time, and
continued weakness should come as no surprise to shareholders
of those stocks.
   On the losers list, Gradco Systems dropped 1 1/2 to 9 1/2.
The company said it had a loss of $3.79 a share in its fourth
quarter ended in March, after taking a charge of about $23
million from the restructuring and consolidation of its
world-wide operations. Gradco earned 27 cents a share in the
year-earlier fourth quarter.
   Separately, Gradco said it expects to report a gain of
about $2.35 a share in the current second quarter from the
proceeds of a $26.5 million private placement in Japan.
   Software Toolworks recovered 1 1/2 of the 4 7/8 point loss
incurred Monday, ending yesterday's session at 20 1/2. The
stock fell in reaction to a bearish article in this week's
Barron's, leading some analysts to defend the company.
   Other OTC technology stocks that advanced include Oracle
Systems, up 5/8 to 23 1/8, and Microsoft, which added 1/8 to
75.
   Newport Pharmaceuticals surged 13/16 to 3 5/8, nearly a
29% rise for the stock. A study conducted by researchers in
Sweden and Denmark suggests that a controversial drug
developed by the company may delay the onset of AIDS in
people infected with the AIDS virus. The Food and Drug
Administration said, however, that other tests of the drug,
isoprinosine, don't support the findings.
   Handex Environmental fell 1 3/4 to 21 1/4. The company
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Monday for
a secondary offering of 750,000 common shares.

Marriott Corp.'s hotel business, said he will continue to
oversee Northwest's customer service and employee-relations
programs as NWA's vice chairman.
   Mr. Malek said his outside commitments, including
organizing the 1990 economic summit for President Bush, made
it increasingly difficult for him to supervise Northwest's
day-to-day operations.
   Mr. Rentschler, who has no previous airline experience,
comes aboard at a critical time for the nation's fourth
largest airline. The carrier needs to pay $2.1 billion in
debt resulting from the Checchi group's $3.65 billion buy-out
last year, it is expanding domestically and in Europe, and it
is overhauling its food service, its aircraft interiors and
its employee-training programs.

   NEW YORK -- Investor Peter B. Bedford nearly doubled his
stake in Amrep Corp., and he said he and management have
discussed possible board representation for him or a
designee.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in
Washington, Mr. Bedford, president of the Lafayette, Calif.,
real estate developer Bedford Properties Inc., disclosed that
his stake in Amrep jumped to 16.16% from 8.7%. Mr. Bedford
said in the filing that he acquired the holding as an
investment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bedford now holds 1,070,020 Amrep common shares,
including 500,320 bought May 4 to June 15 for $7.375 to $7.50
each. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Amrep shares rose 12.5 cents to $7.75.
   Amrep, based here and led by Howard W. Friedman, chairman
and chief executive officer, is a real estate developer and
international magazine distributor. The company has 6.6
million shares outstanding.
   Mr. Friedman confirmed that discussions with Mr. Bedford
are under way. "We're pleased that the Bedford organization
recognizes the values" inherent in Amrep, the executive said.
   Recently, Kane-Miller Corp., a Tarrytown, N.Y., food
processor, disclosed to the SEC that it holds 8.1% of Amrep
and might seek control of the concern. In that filing,
Kane-Miller said it had talked with Amrep about gaining board
representation, but it said those discussions were
"uneventful."
   Neither a Kane-Miller spokesman nor Mr. Bedford was

   NEW YORK -- Ernst &amp; Young said it received approval from
the Soviet Ministry of Finance to perform official audits for
joint ventures of Soviet and Western companies.
   The approval given to the professional-services firm to
audit balance sheets of the ventures follows similar approval
given to Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., another major accounting and
consulting firm.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, Ernst &amp; Young said Oleg Valerious, director
of the official Soviet audit agency, Inaudit, was joining
Ernst &amp; Young's joint venture in the Soviet Union, Ernst &amp;
Young Vneshaudit. The venture is 50%-owned by Ernst &amp; Young,
45%-owned by Vneshconsult, a Soviet management consulting
firm, and 5%-owned by Vneshtechnika, a state
technical-services organization.
   The Ernst &amp; Young venture in the Soviet Union has offices
in Moscow and Kiev; it currently does work in accounting in
addition to some tax and consulting. A spokeswoman for Ernst
&amp; Young said the approval enables the firm to offer a full
range of tax services as well.

   A $1 Million Fine
   In Missouri Case

   Auto Maker's Claim a Vehicle
   Damaged in a Test Drive
   Is `New' Rejected by Jury

   Disadvantage Chrysler: A Missouri jury has slapped the
auto maker with a $1 million penalty for selling a "new" 1985
New Yorker that had been wrecked during a factory official's
test drive.
   The decision, issued last week, stems from the
embarrassing odometer-rollback episode that Chrysler thought
it had put to bed in 1987. Last week a Buchanan County
Circuit Court jury rejected Chairman Lee A. Iacocca's
defense: Repairing a car that's banged up during a test drive
is no different than fixing one that gets damaged on the
assembly line.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Auto makers never "provide notice to dealers or customers
about damage or defects that are discovered and corrected
during the manufacturing process," Mr. Iacocca testified in
deposition taken on May 2 at Chrysler's Highland Park, Mich.,
headquarters. Excerpts of the deposition were read to the
jury during the trial last week.
   Cars that were damaged during test drives were repaired to
meet "each and every Chrysler quality and federal safety
standard," Mr. Iacocca said. He added: "Does it make any
difference whether the component was manufactured defectively
. . . or damaged while the vehicle was being driven in the
test program? The common sense answer to that is no."
   But by a 9-to-3 majority, the jurors ruled that what
Chrysler did was civil fraud. They ordered the company to pay
$1 million in punitive damages. They also ordered Chrysler to
pay $3,000 to compensate Steven and Diane Maugh of St.
Joseph, Mo., for the difference between the $16,190 they paid
for the New Yorker in 1985, and what the jury determined the
car was worth. Missouri law allows for split decisions in
civil cases.
   A Chrysler spokesman said yesterday the company plans to
appeal. "There's no basis in law or fact for the award," the
spokesman said.
   Still, the verdict comes at an awkward time for Chrysler.
The company is in the middle of an aggressive marketing blitz
titled "Advantage: Chrysler." Led by Mr. Iacocca, the
campaign is aimed at persuading consumers that Chrysler's
cars are better than those made by Honda Motor Co. of Japan,
one of the industry's quality leaders.
   The Missouri case revives an issue that Mr. Iacocca had
successfully blunted three years ago: Chrysler's practice of
selling thousands of cars and trucks as brand new, even
though they had been driven as many as 400 miles by factory
officials who had disconnected the vehicles' odometers.
Federal officials charged in June 1987 that the company sold
as new 60,000 such vehicles, including about 40 that had been
involved in wrecks.
   In July 1987, Mr. Iacocca acknowledged that disconnecting
odometers to conduct test drives "went beyond dumb and
reached all the way out to stupid." Chrysler discontinued the
test-drive program. Mr. Iacocca offered to extend the
warranties on all the vehicles involved, and to replace those
that had been damaged.
   Most of the affected buyers took the settlements, but the
Maughs didn't. Nor did they accept the $60,000 Chrysler
offered before the trial to settle the case, according to
their lawyer, John F. Burns.
   Instead, the Maughs filed suit in 1987. At the trial, Mr.
Burns summoned experts who testified that the Maugh's New
Yorker had suffered serious damage to its frame.
   The Chrysler spokesman said yesterday the company's
position is that the Maugh's car suffered no structural
damage. The only damage was to "bolt-on parts," such as the
grille, left front fender and bumper, the spokesman said.
   "The jury didn't buy the argument," said Mr. Burns. "And
they probably won't buy Chryslers."

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Corona Corp.'s plan to
secure control of Canada's hottest gold prospect -- the big
Eskay Creek gold deposit in northwestern British Columbia --
has hit a couple of major roadblocks.
   Placer Dome Inc., a big, cash-rich gold producer that is
competing with Corona to acquire Stikine Resources Ltd.,
half-owner of the Eskay Creek deposit, is expected today to
announce that about 40% of Stikine's 3,330,000 shares were
tendered under Placer Dome's offer, which expired yesterday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Placer Dome said final results of its
225.1 million Canadian dollar (US$191.7 million) or
C$67.50-a-share tender offer for Stikine won't be released
until this morning. But insiders familiar with the bid said
Placer Dome is expected to wind up with about 40% of the
company.
   As a result, Placer Dome will be in a position to thwart a
previously proposed plan under which Corona hoped to secure
control of Stikine through a stock swap and then merge
Stikine and Stikine's Eskay Creek partner, Prime Resources
Group Inc., with a newly created unit, Corona Gold Corp. The
plan requires approval by 75% of Stikine's holders.
   Separately, Corona confirmed that a proposed private
transaction under which it planned to immediately raise its
stake in Prime to 45% from 20% didn't close as scheduled
Friday. Corona's spokesman said the proposed purchase of 10.2
million Prime shares for an equal number of Corona Class A
shares from a group including Prime Chairman Murray Pezim,
associate Arthur Clemiss and Vancouver financier Jim Pattison
is only awaiting regulatory clearance.
   But Mr. Pezim disagreed, citing dissatisfaction with the
terms of the transaction, partly over the decline in Corona's
share price.

   British Steel to Acquire
   A Unit in West Germany

   LONDON -- British Steel PLC said it agreed to acquire the
Mannstaedt steelmaking unit of Klockner Werke AG of West
Germany for 300 million marks ($179.9 million), boosting the
U.K. steelmaker's effort to diversify from its domestic
market.
   The proposed acquisition, under negotiation since January,
will supplement British Steel's strategy to produce
higher-margin products and steer away from lower-margin
commodity products. It also will lessen British Steel's
reliance on its glutted home market, which accounts for 64%
of annual sales.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Executives at British Steel, which has rebounded to
profitability from heavy losses several years ago, said they
are continuing to look for possible acquisitions in the U.S.
and Continental Europe. British Steel, which the government
sold to private investors in 1988, could tap as much as #2
billion ($3.43 billion), including #500 million in cash, for
acquisitions. In a recent interview, British Steel's
chairman, Sir Robert Scholey, said, "Our radar is operating
on all" steelmakers, though he declined to identify any
targets.
   Separately, company officials said Monday's U.S. Supreme
Court decision that may require Dallas-based LTV Corp. to
reassume liability for more than $2 billion in recently
unfunded pensions won't discourage British Steel from
prospecting for U.S. acquisitions. The decision could tarnish
the allure of some U.S. targets.
   Klockner's Mannstaedt division, based near Cologne,
produces about 200,000 tons a year of hot-rolled special
sections of steel and about 120,000 tons a year of hollow and
cold-formed sections from hot-rolled steel coil. Two units
that fabricate mining arches are included in the planned
purchase by British Steel.

   WASHINGTON -- The House, brushing aside demands for budget
cuts, approved a $20.8 billion fiscal 1991 energy and water
bill providing for a 12.7% increase from current spending
levels and accelerating funding for the cleanup of
nuclear-weapons plants.
   The final 355-59 roll call last night capped a day of
defeats for the Republican leadership, which saw many of its
own rank and file repeatedly join Democrats to oppose efforts
for across-the-board spending cuts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   More than 40 Republicans opposed a final bipartisan effort
to impose a reduction of 2%, or $400 million, in the bill,
and the debate underscored the immense difficulties that will
face budget negotiators if and when they bring back a
deficit-reduction package from their budget summit talks with
the Bush administration.
   "I am really depressed," said Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel,
the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee. "They
think the deals are being made in the summit and someone else
can be a hero for them."
   The support summoned for the bill reflects the strength of
the energy and water coalition, which still can win support
among traditionally conservative Southern and Western
delegations even as it now champions more liberal
environmental and scientific initiatives.
   The measure funds an estimated 33 Army Corps of Engineers
construction projects that weren't included in President
Bush's budget, and the total of nearly $3.28 billion for
cleaning up nuclear plants represents an increase of $488
million from the administration's request and more than $1
billion from fiscal 1990, which ends Sept. 30.
   The opposition began at a disadvantage, but the
Republicans also appeared hurt by their failure to frame
clearer choices. The GOP leadership has yet to offer an
alternative budget of its own this year, and in a bill laden
with funding for parochial interests, the one Republican
amendment targeted at a specific account was offered by a
Midwestern lawmaker, who conceded he knew little about the
California power provision that a taxpayers' lobby had asked
him to oppose.
   By contrast, the Democratic leadership appears determined
to use the appropriations process aggressively, both to put
pressure on the summit talks and to spell out the party's
domestic priorities going into the fall elections. On
back-to-back procedural votes, Democrats overrode Republican
objections to taking up spending bills without a final budget
resolution, and by a 276-136 margin, the chamber approved a
resolution making the House budget the guide for dividing
discretionary spending between domestic and military
accounts.
   Among major science accounts, the bill provides the full
$318 million sought by the administration for the
superconducting supercollider. While spending on magnetic
fusion would be frozen near current levels, high-energy
physics programs would grow almost 6% to $621.2 million.
   Reflecting the pressure of Midwestern Republicans on the
House Appropriations Committee, funding for biofuels energy
programs would rise to $36 million, more than double current
levels and 28% above the administration request. Similarly in
solar-energy accounts, where Mr. Bush asked for large
increases, the bill bids up the president and reflects the
political ties of companies in photovoltaic research.
   Despite its financial troubles, Lawrenceville, N.J.-based
Chronar Corp. is a major force here, for example, with its
strong financial ties to the Sheet Metal Workers pension fund
as well as investors or projects in the home districts of
Appropriations Committee members from California and Alabama.
