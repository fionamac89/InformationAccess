   FDR at Yalta: A Naif, Not a Visionary

   As I write this comment on Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s June
21 editorial-page piece, "FDR Vindicated," my reaction has
progressed from astonished to stunned. That anyone, Pulitzer
Prize winner or casual observer, would be so devoid of
objective thinking as to attempt to assign credit for what is
happening in the world today to FDR's vision is absurd. In my
view, it is on the same intellectual plane as giving credit
to Hitler for the great economic surge that occurred after
World War II because he was the one who started the war.
   Mr. Schlesinger's statements that FDR was not naive rely
heavily for support on FDR's credentials as a politician. I
submit that a person can be politically astute and at the
same time extremely naive when it comes to foreign policy. A
number of examples, even in our recent history, can be cited
to support this contention.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Schlesinger fails to give any recognition to the
succession of dedicated leaders from Harry Truman to Ronald
Reagan who believed in and pursued a foreign policy of
"containment" regarding the communist world. This constant
pressure through more than 40 years imposed an economic
burden, crowned by the Reagan administration's rejection of
detente in favor of renewed military preparedness, which
ultimately led to the unraveling of the communist-bloc
economies. To imply that all of this movement toward market
economies, democracy and free enterprise can be explained by
"the Soviet Union is at last honoring the Yalta agreements"
and is the result of some grand vision by FDR is at least
fallacious and perhaps outright dishonest.
   It might be interesting to seek opinions of FDR's grand
vision from the people of Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and
East Germany now emerging from the suffering imposed through
strategies developed by FDR during World War II and at Yalta.
They might get a little testy over Mr. Schlesinger's view
that statesmanship is tested by the long run, as they, unlike
Mr. Schlesinger, participated in the test.
   I recently returned from a trip through western Siberia,
where I talked with a number of well-educated Soviet
citizens. In general, they see their political and economic
system as one large failure. Many of them referred to
communism as 70 years of failure. Without FDR's grand vision
and with a more well-reasoned strategy for achievement of
both our military and political objectives in World War II,
plus the recognition that we were clearly in a dominating
position at the close of the war through our industrial power
and military atomic capability, communism might have been
limited to perhaps as little as 30 years of failure.

   I found Mr. Schlesinger's article about FDR especially
insightful. It is unfortunate there is such scant
appreciation of this great man today. Rarely in history has
there been an individual who has shaped so many lives.
   Almost all of the things we take for granted today had
their genesis under FDR's tutelage. The Yalta agreements had
absolutely nothing to do with the actual fact of the Cold
War. Unable to directly challenge Social Security, the
minimum wage and so on, the right wing in this country has
sought consistently to discredit FDR -- and by implication
the New Deal -- by charging that he gave away Eastern Europe
to Stalin. This is ridiculous. The fact that Stalin had an
army of nearly 20 million occupying these East European
countries was not about to change, short of a full-scale war
between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.
   Roosevelt was one of a kind. The world lost its brightest
light when he died.
   Kenneth Joyce

   ---
   Mr. Schlesinger's defense of FDR has a dreamlike quality
to it. Had we listened to Churchill, Stalin would have not
been in Eastern Europe in the first place.
   As for Stalin's "short-run gain," fortunately for Mr.
Schlesinger and me, we did not have to survive in Eastern
Europe for some 45 years while waiting for the outcome of the
60/40 convergence to happen and for President Reagan to come
along to make the vision a reality.
   James T. Salles

   What a marvelous tribute to the American political icon of
the 20th century. Mr. Schlesinger's astute commentary does
vindicate FDR at long last.
   Ann Papastefan
   Cudahy, Wis.
   ---
   Mr. Schlesinger's fantasy is belied by Roosevelt's own
embittered realization, as the Iron Curtain quickly
descended, that "We can't do business with Stalin. He has
broken every one of the promises he made at Yalta."
   Roosevelt, Churchill and the nations they led through
World War II made sacrifices and accomplished things for
which those of us born later must stand in gratitude and awe.
Still, we owe it to future generations to see the past
clearly. At Yalta, as at Munich, the Western democracies
permitted massive human misery by accepting promises (quickly
broken) from tyrants instead of mustering the will to force
the tyrants to back down.
   Freedom is emerging in Eastern Europe today because the
people there have had the courage to seek it, and because the
West has had the political will to show the Soviets that
empire and tyranny have a price. To credit today's freedom to
the "accords" Roosevelt got from Stalin at Yalta is as wrong
as to credit such peace as Europe has had to the accords
Chamberlain got from Hitler at Munich.
   Gregory A. Inskip
   Wilmington, Del.
   ---
   Mr. Schlesinger's thoughtful assessment contains one
revisionist clinker: "FDR hoped, but failed, to prevent the
French from returning to Indochina. Had he succeeded, America
would have been spared much agony, and many brave Americans
who died in Vietnam would be alive today."
   To ascribe the deaths of more than 50,000 Americans in
Vietnam to the pigheadedness of French colonialists is a bit
much. Let's place credit -- or lack thereof -- for the Second
Indochina War (1964-73) where it belongs. The French didn't
dispatch 500,000 Americans to Vietnam -- American policy
makers, many of them Mr. Schlesinger's colleagues, made those
fateful decisions. The American experience in Vietnam was
brought to us by deep thinkers along the banks of the Charles
River (and the Pedernales), not the Seine.
   Rory Quirk

   One must admire Mr. Schlesinger's chutzpah. Roosevelt had
within his command the power to alter the course of history
had he chosen a course less daring. Whether his decision was
because of hubris, naivete or physical infirmity matters not.
I wonder how the millions who died at the hands of Stalin and
his minions would feel about Mr. Schlesinger's emendation of
history.
   James W. Murray
   Nashville, Tenn.
   ---
   I agree with Mr. Schlesinger that FDR did not throw
Central Europe to Uncle Joe at Yalta through ignorance,
stupidity or foolish pride. He did it earlier (most clearly
at Tehran) for what many might view as good reasons. First,
FDR was sensibly desperate to keep Stalin's armies in the
field against the Axis powers. Second, he seems to have
recognized that neither of the democratic Allied victors
would have the stomach to reverse what started World War II
in 1939 -- the armed enslavement of Poland. If Poland, of all
places, was fair game for Stalin, what in Central Europe
wasn't?
   Before the U.S. entry into the war, it can be argued, FDR
led public awareness of the threat of fascism. As Hitler's
and Tojo's prospects faded, he appears as a merely competent
politician. FDR's embrace of Stalin as an ally, rather than
as a self-interested co-belligerant, set in motion the
domestic propaganda machine that may have sealed the fate of
Central Europe for nearly a half-century. Whatever the
participants at Yalta signed, the people of Poland, East
Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria (not
to mention the Baltic States) will have endured at least 45
years of communist gangsterism.
   The legal and technical niceties of the Yalta accords (Mr.
Schlesinger admits that they were inherently unenforceable)
provided a basis for denying responsibility for what happened
behind the Iron Curtain. Now they are being used to claim
credit for what the brave people of Central Europe are trying
do on their own.

   PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia Stock Exchange said it
plans to extend its trading day in foreign-currency options,
beginning Sept. 16.
   The exchange said its current 14-hour trading day will be
stretched to 19.5 hours during months of daylight-saving
time, to coincide with afternoon trading in the Far East and
in Pacific Rim countries. In fall and winter months, the
trading day will become 20.5 hours.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   New hours will run from 7 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. EDT the
following day. Current hours run from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. EDT
and from 4:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. EDT. During fall and winter,
trading will begin at 6 p.m. EST.
   In September 1987, the exchange introduced an evening
trading session for foreign-currency options to accommodate
increased demand in the Far East. In January 1989, the
exchange added an early-morning session to accommodate the
European market.
   Total daily volume in currency-option contracts traded on
the exchange has grown to represent about $2 billion in
underlying value.

   CLINTON, N.J. -- Foster Wheeler Corp. said its French
subsidiary was awarded a contract to design and build a new
plant for Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly &amp; Co. that will
produce synthetic human insulin, called humulin.
   The new facility, which is expected to cost most of the
$115 million that Lilly has budgeted for expenditure in
France, will be located near Lilly's existing plant in
Fergersheim, near Strasbourg. The plant's start-up is slated
for 1993.

   Job-Injury Burden Could Disable Some Companies

   Years ago you'd see signs like the one still outside a
county-government service yard in Santa Ana, Calif., boasting
of consecutive days in operation without time lost to injury.
This seemed a macabre, public form of bean counting. These
days it pays to keep such a watch.
   Wage costs are beginning to hurt after nearly a decade of
relief, and U.S. employers are being pinched on the payroll
periphery by such factors as rising health-care premiums and
Social Security taxes. The most rapid increases, however, may
be in workers' compensation expenses, now approaching $50
billion a year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Workers' comp -- the liability for an employee injured on
the job -- is a burden varying greatly among companies,
industries and states. It's four times worse in California
than in Indiana, for example. But the general trend is not a
happy one for business owners. In jurisdictions where costs
have gotten most out of hand, some reforms have been
attempted. They aren't fundamental enough.
   In some ways, the workers' comp picture resembles that of
health care: a rapid growth in expenditures punctuated by
attempts to control costs that are followed by new breakouts.
The similarity is understandable, given that the medical
component of workers' comp has been rising (to about 40%)
vis-a-vis the traditionally dominant payment in lieu of
wages.
   Thus also expectedly, is that plaintiff lawyers and other
fee grabbers have caught wind of this honey pot and are
widening the gap between what employers pay in and employees
take out.
   The rise in job-injury litigation is ironic because
workers' comp programs were begun in most of the states early
this century as a no-fault way of handling industrial
accidents. Companies generally favored the approach and
unions didn't. The system sufficed from an employer's
standpoint but the benefits for injured workers didn't keep
pace with rapidly rising wages after World War II. By 1972, a
report to President Nixon cleared the way for big hikes in
most states. Costs rose with benefits, not simply for the
obvious reason but also because, scholars seem to agree,
higher payouts draw more claimants.
   If that explained a leap in the '70s, the late '80s cost
surge is harder to figure. Lost-pay benefits have been
ratcheted higher in some states to catch up with steep wage
inflation a decade ago, but other factors are at work.
   Foremost is medicine, which by one forecast will
constitute half of workers' comp costs in the year 2000.
Techniques for holding down treatment bills, though rapidly
being introduced to standard employee health-care coverage,
mostly aren't found in workers' comp. Some suspect that
off-the-job ailments are increasingly being passed off as
work-incurred.
   "Occupational disease," including service-counter
"stress," has gained favor in liberal jurisdictions. These
are less physically taxing times, but exposure to suspected
carcinogens and other toxins is a perceived peril, while the
pain of so-called carpal-tunnel syndrome, traced to
repetitive hand and arm motions, is a complaint of
journalists and other electronic-keyboard users. But,
according to Cornell Prof. John Burton, who publishes the
newsletter Workers' Compensation Monitor,
occupational-disease remains a tough sell in most states, as
employees must show that their last job and not the life
leading up to it is the source of woe.
   Most workers' comp claims are for short absences with a
minor injury. These are the ones that seem to rise most
surely with the benefit level. The most costly tab, however,
is for what's known as permanent partial disability. Often
those claims are settled in large lump sums to close out
open-ended obligations. Ten years ago, it was thought that
employers were remiss in not bringing such injured workers
back into productive employment, so some states mandated
"vocational rehabilitation." This mainly profited providers,
alas, and the mandates are being repealed.
   The biggest third-party cut, not surprisingly, is going to
attorneys. California is particularly beset, although Texas
and Florida too have big workers' comp bars. Alan Tebb of the
insurer-funded California Workers' Compensation Institute
says 12% of all claims in that state are litigated -- 44% of
those involving lost work time -- and he puts the "frictional
cost" per contested case (in lawyer fees, paid testimony from
the "dueling doctors" on each side, photocopying) at $5,800
as of 1988 (vs. $2,436 in 1981). A sixfold rise in litigation
costs in 10 years helps to explain why workers' comp cost
California employers $637 per worker in 1987, 72% above the
national mean.
   Unions and some academics say lawsuits wouldn't be a
problem if employees didn't feel abandoned, if state workers'
comp agencies promptly and conscientiously adjudicated
claims. Wisconsin is praised in this respect, but usually
appeal boards are a budgetary backwater. Indeed, in its
current fiscal crunch, California may target employers for an
extra hit to cover administration of the program.
   California also saw one of the most recent efforts to
reform workers' comp, in legislation passed last year.
Benefit levels were hiked while some of the other costs were
attacked. Only sketchy results are in, but previous revisions
in other states, such as in Florida at the end of the '70s,
proved to have only a passing effect.
   The trick is to get incentives right, to empower employees
to choose the best affordable option while discouraging them
from malingering. One idea is to allow payroll deductions
into a tax-deferred "portable" account for each employee. The
benefits could be drawn out for certified job injuries or, if
unused, partially converted to cash at retirement.
   Long-term disabilities could cause actuarial problems in
that setup, so maybe we should start with Princeton economist
Alan Krueger's proposal to establish a deductible of sorts:
Workers would need to be off the job 14 days before they
could collect workers' comp. Each worker would have to
shoulder the burden of minor injuries -- which Mr. Krueger
thinks are more likely to be fudged -- in return for higher
long-term benefits, which he supports.
   With employers, encouraging the growth of self-insurance
would discipline companies by forcing them to bear the actual
costs of their practices. (And guess what? -- workers seem to
return to the job sooner when their boss is directly on the
hook for their absence.) Meantime higher benefit levels seem
to result in fewer serious injuries, presumably by prodding
the boss to maintain a safer workplace.
   Workers' compensation is a classic societal safety net.
The challenge is to make it available and reliable for those
who need it by making sure the financial supports are strong
and getting rid of the ballast of middle men holding it too
near the ground.

   States Test Bare-Bones Health Insurance

   States are doing more to encourage small businesses to
provide health insurance voluntarily.
   In Virginia, Washington and Florida, new laws permit
experimental, limited coverage for small companies that don't
already offer health benefits. Connecticut recently passed a
law that temporarily reduces rates for such small firms and
establishes a pooling arrangement to cover people with
existing medical conditions. Other states are starting still
more programs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While an estimated two-thirds of small businesses
nationwide offer health coverage, more than a third of the
nation's approximately 31 million uninsured people are
affiliated with small firms. And rates are going up for those
companies that do offer coverage. According to a survey early
this year by National Small Business United, a
Washington-based group, insurance rates increased between 16%
and 35% this year over last for 38% of the business owners
polled.
   To cut costs, the new laws in Virginia, Washington and
Florida exempt the barebones small-group policies from state
mandates to cover certain medical treatments. The insurers
can instead offer coverage for hospitalization and basic
physician's care. State laws requiring carriers to cover such
items as treatment for drug or alcohol abuse, mammograms and
psychiatric and chiropractic care can raise rates by 17% to
20%.
   Some small-business owners are enthusiastic. Gerald Roscoe
hasn't been able to afford health insurance for employees at
his two-year-old general contracting firm in Lexington, Va.
"I own the bloody company, and I'm not insured," he says. But
he's interested in Virginia's new program. "To grow, we need
to attract squared-away people who are responsible with their
lives," he says. "One of the ways we can do that is by
offering health insurance."
   Because the laws just took effect, insurance companies are
still drawing up specific plans. Blue Cross and Blue Shield
of Virginia, which offers about a third of all policies in
the state, will begin marketing its basic health plan next
month. It's expected to cost eligible small employers about
$80 a month per worker, compared with an average (for all
carriers in the state) of about $130 monthly per employee.
The company has added a limit of $50,000 in medical expenses
per calendar year to further lower the cost. To qualify, a
company can't have offered employees health coverage for the
last year.
   Similar plans are cropping up in other states as well.
Blue Cross companies in Oklahoma and California recently
started offering small groups bare-bones lower-cost insurance
policies, says Gregory Scanlon, director of Blue Cross Blue
Shield Association, which represents 74 independent,
nonprofit state insurance plans. In Oklahoma, the policy
costs from $22.50 a month for those under 19 to $123 monthly
for people 64 and older.
   "It's a step in the right direction," says Thomas Inman,
president of Virginia Home Medical, a Newport News, Va.,
medical supply company that already provides health insurance
for its workers. But he warns that the price of even a
bare-bones policy may be high for a company with a history of
medical problems. Health insurance rates for his company shot
up 62% this year, to $26,000 annually for 22 workers, he
says. The rates skyrocketed after the wife of one of his
employees contracted cancer and diabetes.
   Small businesses that already offer insurance say such
steep rate increases can quickly make the benefit impossible
to afford. Mr. Inman says if his health insurance rate nearly
doubles again, he'll have to drop the benefit.
   Typically, small employers lack access to insurance from
any carrier if they don't have many employees or one of their
workers already has a condition requiring medical care.
IMSCO, a Newark, Ohio, company with four employees, lost its
hospitalization policy after one employee had seven major
operations to correct a life-threatening condition and the
owner had heart bypass surgery. "Nobody wanted to cover us.
One insurance agent even got mad that he had wasted time
coming out to our office," says the company's president, Gary
Stansbury. The group finally got insurance when a health
maintenance organization accepted the group by mistake and
couldn't legally reverse the decision.
   Regulators and small-business officials are optimistic
that the experimental programs will lead to broader efforts
both to hold down costs and to increase coverage. "This is
one step that's the first of many, but it can immediately
show results," says Gary Smith, director of the Independent
Business Association of Washington state. He says small firms
with fewer than 10 workers in the state now pay 40% more for
the same health care contract offered to businesses with more
than 50 employees.
   There's considerably less confidence that the Connecticut
plan will help entrepreneurs. There, the lower rates for
small businesses will result partly from an agreement that
hospitals and other health care providers will accept less
money over the next three years to care for the newly insured
patients. And all companies will pay into the fund covering
those with poor health.
   "This {legislation} will guarantee that for a limited
period, everybody working in Connecticut will be able to
acquire coverage at some price," says John Polk, executive
director of the Council of Smaller Enterprises, a Cleveland
group that purchases health insurance for its member
companies.
   But he charges that the law will allow steep rate
increases and require inclusion of all state-mandated medical
care. "It's my sense that what insurers are intending to do
here is not change the way they do business but change the
way they explain their current behavior," he says.
   The National Association of Manufacturers says most of its
members with fewer than 25 employees offer health insurance.
"Affordability is more the issue for them," says Sharon
Canner, the association's health policy director. "There's
some belief that costs could go up {under the Connecticut
plan} because all employers contribute to the high-risk
pool."
   Mr. Scanlon of Blue Cross Blue Shield Association agrees
that the Connecticut plan is unlikely to reduce rates. "I'm
concerned that after a couple of years, policy makers will
say, `Where's the result?' They'll feel as though they've
been misled," he says.
   Many businesses say the insurance would be more affordable
if they could tailor their coverage. Diane Orlowski, a
co-owner of J.F.D. Tube &amp; Coil Products Inc. of Hamden,
Conn., complains that she must provide coverage for maternity
care and counseling for drug abuse and psychological problems
even though the services are rarely used by her 22-member
work force.
   "I get a lot of raised eyebrows when an employee leaves
and I ask them if they want to continue their health
insurance on their own," she says. Under a 1986 federal law,
workers have the right to extend coverage. Ms. Orlowski says
that because of the expense, her employees rarely extend
their health coverage.
   Despite the doubts, the Health Insurance Association of
America says the Connecticut law reflects many of the
principles governing service to small groups that it adopted
early this year. At that time, the industry trade group said
that it favors limits on how much rates can vary for
similarly situated companies; establishing a national,
nonprofit reinsurance mechanism to pay medical bills for
high-risk individuals; and an end to significantly increasing
a company's insurance rate because one worker has a health
problem. The National Federation of Independent Business, the
Chamber of Commerce, the Association of Manufacturers and
National Small Business United support those proposals.
   "There's no instant solution; it'll take three years,"
Carl Schram, the insurance association's president, says of
the Connecticut program. "But we go into this with great hope
that it'll operate to solve the problem."

   In blue blazers and white shirts, London schoolchildren

shoes are made in America.
   Last year, more than 300,000 British feet were shod in new

in Italy have been known to yank them off victims' feet.

   In Germany, health concerns are forcing the removal of
asbestos insulation from countless postwar buildings. The
unpleasant work is made easier by equipment manufactured and
sold by Critical Industries Inc., of Houston.
   The Soviets, too, are beginning to "buy American." This
fall, at the request of the Ukrainian Ministry of Health,
Mayer Laboratories Inc., of Oakland, Calif., will start
exporting a product long in woefully short supply in the
U.S.S.R.: condoms.
   As the leaders of the world's seven largest industrial
nations meet in Houston, the success of U.S. businesses in
Europe tells of a surprising global turnaround. Americans may
still worry that their nation is on the losing end of
international trade. But in Europe, a growing demand for
everything from Chrysler minivans to Converse Allstars has
turned a once-yawning U.S. trade deficit with Europe into a
surplus.
   Look at the numbers: The gap between what the U.S. buys
from and sells to Western Europe withered from $28.2 billion
in 1986 to $1.3 billion in 1989. And for the first four
months of 1990, the Commerce Department reported a $2.7
billion surplus with Western Europe.
   Moreover, most analysts believe the upheavals in Eastern
Europe will cause this U.S. surplus to widen rapidly. Even if
U.S. companies move slowly into newly opened markets such as
Poland, Hungary and East Germany, they will benefit as West
European competitors turn eastward.
   "There will be a vacuum caused by West Germany moving its
surplus to the East," predicts Adrian Dillon, chief economist
at Eaton Corp. in Cleveland. "That means there will be new
markets for U.S. producers in Western Europe. We're going to
benefit indirectly but substantially."
   Bruce Steinberg, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., predicts that the U.S. surplus with Europe could reach
$25 billion to $30 billion a year, in a return to the glory
days of American trade more than a decade ago.
   On top of the list of things American that Europeans are
eager to buy is airplanes. European customers ordered 298
airliners from Boeing Co. last year, a 15-fold increase from
the 19 booked in 1984. The Seattle company's new 737 models,
smaller jets introduced in the past few years, have been
especially big sellers among European charter services.
   "Europe is an expanding area. There are new airlines
coming up. A lot of international airlines have tour
businesses there. They have airlines expanding there all the
time," says Kirsti Dunn, Boeing's public-relations manager
for Europe.
   Cigarettes are also a hot item. Last year, Marlboro became
the No. 1 cigarette in France, surpassing sales of the
Gauloises and Gitanes brands produced by a state monopoly and
long almost synonymous with the French. Although most
Marlboros sold in Europe are made in Europe, according to the
manufacturer, Philip Morris Cos., the tobacco shipped by the
company to its European subsidiary contributed to a $500
million jump in U.S. tobacco exports to Europe over the past
four years.
   Multinational giants aren't the only companies involved.
In the three years since Medical Concepts Inc., a small
manufacturer of video endoscopy instruments based in Santa
Barbara, Calif., began exporting, its sales to Europe have
"snowballed," says Angeli Mancuso, the product manager. With
European medical procedures increasingly relying on cameras,
some company executives expect European sales to double again
next year.
   Even the flow of culture has reversed course, with the New
World last year shipping $2.2 billion of paintings, sculpture
and antiques to the Old. Commerce Department figures show
that art-and-antiques has become one of the nation's biggest
categories of exports to Europe, growing even more rapidly
over the past three years than fast-sellers such as
semiconductors, telecommunications gear and hospital and
scientific equipment.
   "Europeans had tended to think of us as an upstart on the
other side of the pond who didn't really have a heritage
yet," says Robert Kenner, senior editor of Art &amp; Antiques
magazine. But after an 18th-century American desk and
bookcase brought an astonishing $12.1 million at an auction
last year, the market for American antiques has taken off.
"Suddenly, there was this record price for any piece of
furniture sold in the world. Suddenly, American furniture,
which had been slowly gaining on Europeans, shot ahead," he
says.
   The elimination of U.S. tax breaks on donations to museums
in 1986 is also encouraging more and more collectors to put
valuable artwork up for auction. And with gifts dwindling,
museums themselves are selling off parts of their collections
to buy new pieces. "What that means is things that have not
been on the market for a very long time are suddenly
appearing," Mr. Kenner says. "The fresh material is very
attractive" to buyers world-wide.
   Whether selling engine turbines or blue jeans, American
companies are benefiting from recent economic trends. In the
early and mid-1980s, the combination of an escalating dollar
and stagnating European economies battered U.S. exports.
America's merchandise trade balance with Western Europe
deteriorated from a $20.6 billion surplus in 1980 to a $28.2
billion deficit in 1986.
   But the dollar, since hitting a devastating high in
February 1985, is down sharply. That makes U.S. goods more
affordable abroad. And recently, European growth has
rebounded. "Europe finally started coming out of the
doldrums," says C. Michael Aho, an economist at the Council
on Foreign Relations in New York. Meanwhile, the recent slow
growth in the U.S. economy is curbing demand for imports.
   The reversal has made a big difference to Caterpillar Inc.
In 1985, the big Peoria, Ill., manufacturer exported $324
million of machines and parts to Europe. In 1986, after the
dollar began descending, the company shipped $449 million
worth. That 38.6% surge came mostly because "realized prices
improved significantly because the dollar weakened," says
Jeff Hawkinson, a company spokesman.
   Cat's exports to Europe have kept climbing ever since.
Last year, they were almost $700 million, more than double
their total just four years before.
   Capital-equipment makers such as Caterpillar have also
profited from European companies' preparations for 1992, when
the 12-nation European Community will eliminate all trade
barriers. The rush to upgrade plants and equipment is opening
opportunities for the U.S., traditionally a leading force in
capital-goods markets.
   "Americans sell capital goods, and the Europeans are
buying," says Robert Z. Lawrence, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution in Washington. In 1989, capital goods
accounted for 46% of U.S. exports to Western Europe, and 35%
of all U.S. capital-goods exports went there.
   Also spurring U.S. exports is Europe's "Green" movement,
with its environmental and health concerns. Critical
Industries has found a lucrative niche in Europe for its
asbestos-removal equipment. "Growth in Europe has probably
been a lot faster than anywhere else," says Ken Kondo, vice
president of the five-year-old Houston company's Critical
Engineering Group.
   Solarex Corp., a subsidiary of Amoco Corp., has benefited,
too. Solarex makes solar cells, which convert sunlight
directly into electricity, and last year a large West German
utility bought a Solarex system. European sales have "picked
up very significantly," says John Goldsmith, vice president
of corporate development. "I think the concern in Europe over
pollution problems, environmental problems, Chernobyl has
really helped to amplify the usefulness of this technology."
   With the impending unification of Germany and the opening
of Eastern Europe, both Solarex and Critical Industries
believe that the appeal of their products in Europe will
grow. "Previously, Communist countries were not concerned
about health effects and the environment. Now, concern in
West Germany will be brought over to East Germany," Mr. Kondo
predicts.
   Most American companies acknowledge that it will be some
time before the fledgling market economies in the East have
the cash to buy many American goods. But in the long term,
Caterpillar's Mr. Hawkinson says, "We see a great potential
market there because of the tremendous infrastructure needs
of those countries that haven't been dealt with for a long
time."
   Many analysts expect U.S. companies to reap more-immediate
benefits from changes Eastern Europe is causing in Western
markets. "There's going to be a massive wave of exports from
West Germany to East Germany," says Brian Horrigan, director
of long-term forecasting at WEFA Group, a consulting firm in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "What happens to the markets in Western
Europe that West Germany was exporting to? That opens up huge
opportunities for the U.S."
   Prime Computer Inc., of Nantick, Mass., hopes to increase
sales of its computer-aided manufacturing and computer-aided
design systems to West European companies planning to set up
operations in the East.
   "Many of our customers in Germany, Italy and France are
looking for ways to penetrate those markets," says Douglas P.
Smith, Prime Computer's vice president of finance and
business, citing Fiat, Audi, Volvo, Peugeot and other large
European auto makers. "They are looking for how to establish
a manufacturing base in those countries. . . . As they move
into Eastern Europe, they are going to migrate our design
systems along with them and build up a supplier network as
well."
   Migration, in a way, is how it all began for Timberland
Co. in Western Europe. An Italian distributor showed up in
New Hampshire one day and ordered about 4,000 pairs of shoes
to take back to Italy. After Europeans saw them, says Rod
Williams, international vice president, "it's gone bananas
ever since."

   The Life-Insurance Quandary:
   How Much Is Really Enough?

   How much life insurance do you need?
   Many people have either too little or too much, financial
advisers say. But the specialists frequently disagree on just
how much is enough.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Anyone who consults two or more experts may be tempted to
give up in disgust: Asked by The Wall Street Journal to
evaluate the life-insurance needs of a hypothetical
45-year-old corporate manager, 10 advisers and insurance
sellers gave suggestions that ranged from as little as
$250,000 to as much as $1,250,000.
   But the risk of leaving loved ones in financial peril is
too great to simply shelve the whole question. And
thankfully, deciding how much life insurance to carry doesn't
have to be as frustrating as it first seems.
   The key is to accept that there isn't a magic number.
"It's a bit naive to think there's one right answer. But
there probably is a correct range" of coverage for each
person, says George E.L. Barbee, executive director of
personal financial services for accountants Price Waterhouse.
   A reasonable game plan: Try a few methods to estimate
insurance needs. Scrutinize and vary the assumptions used.
Weigh the costs of different amounts of coverage. Then settle
on a figure that feels right. Any thoughtful decision will
probably be better than no decision at all.
   The goal is to provide money your dependents can tap
immediately and over the years if you should die tomorrow.
Don't worry if you can't figure out what it will cost to send
your daughter to college in 2003, or that your spouse's ideas
about retirement could change several times before 2014.
   Use the best information you have now. And keep in mind
that insurance coverage can -- and should -- be modified as
family circumstances change. "We see so often that even one
year later so many things have changed," says Robert DeValle,
a Palo Alto, Calif., insurance agent.
   There are always trade-offs. A large policy could assure
one's children the financial wherewithal to go to Harvard.
But "you're spending a lot of money for the premiums that
could have been used for some other purposes" -- such as
saving to finance family goals in the event breadwinners live
for decades, says Tim Kochis, national director of personal
financial planning for accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche.
   The simplest approach is to use an old rule of thumb that
life-insurance coverage should equal five to seven times --
some say as much as 10 times -- a person's annual salary.
"The multiples appeal to me because they're easy to use,"
says James H. Hunt, an actuary and director of the National
Insurance Consumer Organization, Alexandria, Va.
   Unfortunately, the multiples provide only ballpark
figures, which may be totally inappropriate for a particular
family's needs and goals. For instance, single people
generally don't need life insurance, while the primary
breadwinner in a family with young children may need tons.
   A modified version of the multiples approach is contained
in the accompanying table, which was prepared at the
Journal's request by insurer Principal Financial Group, Des
Moines, Iowa. It's essentially a worst-case calculation of
how much life insurance would be needed to replace 75% of a
person's take-home pay if there were no other income for the
survivors. Social Security benefits, a surviving spouse's
salary and investment earnings, among other things, would
lower the insurance need.
   Principal Financial Group itself prefers that its agents
use a detailed computer-aided analysis to weigh a family's
financial resources against the sums the survivors are likely
to need. This is a standard approach for many insurance
agents and financial planners.
   Computer-assisted recommendations aren't without flaws,
however. While they can be highly personalized, they are
dependent on the numerous assumptions and projections plugged
into the computer. Change one variable and you can change the
bottom line greatly.
   Individuals can do an abbreviated version of the analysis,
without a computer, by using a worksheet like the one printed
near the end of this article. (See accompanying illustration
-- WSJ July 10, 1990) It is based on work by Virginia
Applegarth, a principal with the Boston advisory firm TFC
Financial Management. Ms. Applegarth is also the author of
"How to Protect Your Family With Insurance," one in a series
of consumer guides partly underwritten by John Hancock Mutual
Life Insurance Co., Boston.
   Running through the worksheet clearly shows how the
varying of some key decisions can lead to greatly different
results.
   Consider the hypothetical corporate manager for whom the
10 financial advisers, insurance companies and agents were
asked to make recommendations. Assume the husband, age 45,
earns $75,000 a year and gets life insurance at work of two
times his salary. The wife, 42, earns $25,000 in a part-time
job that doesn't provide group life insurance. Their two
children are 15 and 12.
   Two of the biggest decisions in buying insurance are the
number of years the surviving spouse's income should be
supplemented and at what level.
   The lowest insurance suggestion for the man came from Ms.
Applegarth, who said a "bare-bones" minimum would be
$250,000-$100,000 of new coverage on top of the $150,000
provided by his employer. Using the worksheet, she figured
that sum, added to the family's other resources, would be
sufficient to pay off the mortgage on the family home, fund a
private-college education for the two children and then
supplement the wife's income just until the youngest child is
in college. The assumption was she would then return to
full-time work. ("Some men say, `I'm not feathering the nest
for the next husband,'" notes Peter C. Katt, a West
Bloomfield, Mich., insurance counselor.)
   At the high end, USAA Life Insurance Co., San Antonio,
Texas, diagnosed a need for an additional $1.1 million of
coverage for the hypothetical manager. That assumes that the
wife would continue to work part-time and that her income
would be supplemented to age 80, her approximate life
expectancy. "That's what I would do for my wife," says senior
account representative Michael Ragland.
   USAA sells its policies directly to the public, and
representatives such as Mr. Ragland use computers to analyze
in 10 to 30 minutes the insurance needs of consumers who call
the company toll-free (800-531-8000).
   Another big variable is college costs. Some parents figure
$20,000 a year in today's dollars for an Ivy League school.
Others say they worked their way through college, so their
kids can do the same, says David F. Woods, a Springfield,
Mass., agent.
   There's also the question of whether the insurance is to
be used to pay off the mortgage on the family home. That's an
important goal for many insurance buyers, although financial
planners say it often doesn't make sense to retire a mortgage
early.
   The average recommendation for the hypothetical manager
was for about $600,000 in additional coverage -- $750,000
total. Using the worksheet, with some assumptions that are
more generous than Ms. Applegarth's, produced a similar
suggestion.
   And what about the wife? The insurance specialists
generally agreed that the family should buy insurance on her
life to replace part of her financial contributions to the
family if she died. The suggested amounts again varied widely
with the assumptions made.
   For example, James H. Temple, a vice president at
Prudential Insurance Co. of America, Newark, N.J., calculated
that $185,000 in coverage would do nicely to give the husband
the comfort of a paid-off mortgage and an instant college
fund for the children if the wife died tomorrow. Several
other people also suggested coverage between $100,000 and
$200,000. Prudential's computer system analysis said the
insurance need jumps to a steep $421,000 if the family also
wants to use the policy to supplement the husband's income in
retirement.
   Insurance specialists say coverage can also make sense for
a nonworking spouse. The reason: to pay for child care or
other services that would be needed upon that person's death.

   Soviet Miners Demand Nothing Less Than End
   Of Party's Power in One-Day Strike This Week

   DONETSK, U.S.S.R. -- Yefim Zvyagilsky stands sweating in a
sports stadium near the center of this Ukrainian coal-mining
town, trying to persuade a huge crowd of miners not to go
ahead with a planned strike this week.
   For a while, the crowd listens patiently, if skeptically,
to his arguments. Then Mr. Zvyagilsky, a portly mine director
and member of the Ukrainian parliament, pushes his luck.
"Your political slogans are an insult to the honor of the
Communist Party," he gripes. The assembled miners erupt in a
chorus of jeers, hoots and whistles that forces Mr.
Zvyagilsky off the rostrum and out of the stadium.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As he leaves, cursing under his breath, one miner runs up
to him waving his fist. "You are all terrible people," he
shouts.
   At its Congress in Moscow, the Soviet Communist Party is
agonizing over how to regain the confidence of the working
class. Here in the Soviet industrial heartland, the workers
don't want to hear the answer. On Wednesday, the miners of
Donetsk are planning to join their colleagues around the
nation in a one-day strike. Unlike their work stoppage last
summer, they aren't calling for more soap and sausage. This
time, it's the Communist Party that they're after.
   "This is a normal political strike," says Valery Chaly, a
miners' leader from the town of Stakhanov, which is named
after the legendary Soviet miner Alexei Stakhanov, who mined
more than 100 tons of coal in one shift in 1935, at the
height of Stalin's industrialization campaign. "We need to
destabilize the socialist model that is leading us to ruin."
   Political strikes, of course, are anything but normal in
the Soviet Union. But miners, like many workers, have grown
increasingly bold and restive in the past year. Alarmed about
an apparent conservative backlash in the party against
Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms, they are joining hands with
radical democrats to demand the end of party power
altogether.
   Their strike demands include the resignation of the
government and decisive moves to remove party influence from
factories, the army, the KGB, the courts and the national
education system. They also want all party property to be
handed over to local government.
   "We can see at the Congress that reactionary forces have
consolidated themselves," says Viktor Makarenko, a miners'
union official. "The party says it's a party of the people,
but it's the party of apparatchiks. They defend their
interests, not ours."
   Such widespread sentiments are a mixed blessing for Mr.
Gorbachev. On the one hand, the miners' demands for a
transfer of power from the party to elected government are in
line with the Soviet president's own political agenda.
Although Mr. Gorbachev has urged them not to strike, miners'
leaders believe he isn't completely averse to some protest
action. They say it will help him in his battle with the
military and other party conservatives who are trying to slow
the pace of reform, if not reverse it altogether.
   But with the Soviet economy in a deep recession, strikes
are the last thing that Mr. Gorbachev needs. Although the
miners haven't won the support of others for their one-day
protest this week, they are lobbying hard to persuade railway
and steel workers to unite with them in future actions. With
the national mood already restless, the situation could
easily spiral out of control.
   "What we need more than ever before is the highest
possible degree of harmony in society," Mr. Gorbachev told
the Congress last week. "This is no time for ultimatums and
conflicts, or for ill-considered actions that divide people
and aggravate the situation."
   Some miners agree. "It's no good going on strike," says
Ilya Matvienko, who has been in a wheelchair since his back
was injured in an accident at the coal face in 1978. "They
complain that there is little in the shops. But if people
don't work, there will be nothing at all in the shops."
   Such moderation is getting harder to find these days in
Donetsk, where miners are cooler headed than their
counterparts in other mining communities, such as Vorkuta in
Northern Russia or the Kuznetsk region of Siberia, where
living conditions are worse. While a few work collectives
here have decided against joining the strike, and others say
they may not take the whole day off, but just join a protest
rally in town for a few hours, public indignation is growing
louder here.
   Most miners in the region, which has some of the oldest
and deepest coal pits in the nation, are angry that the
government has failed to fulfill the pledges it made to end
last year's national strike. They included giving miners a
greater say in running their affairs, as well as promising to
ship in more consumer goods. One year later, people here
fume, little has really changed.
   "It was a mistake to sign that document; perhaps it was
just political inexperience," says Sergei Formanyuk, a member
of the Donetsk town council. He contends that Soviet Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov agreed to go along with the
settlement, "not because he believed in fulfilling {the
conditions}, but because he wanted to end the strike."
   Such feelings of betrayal are widespread, and have already
led to big upheavals in Donetsk politics. The town's
Communist Party leader resigned earlier this year after
miners and others staged mass demonstrations to press for his
removal. In local elections soon afterwards, radicals won a
two-thirds majority of seats on the town council, making
Donetsk one of only a handful of places in the Ukraine where
conservative party officials lost control. The town council
is actively supporting this week's planned strike.
   Moreover, workers at the Kalinin mine in Donetsk moved to
fulfil one of their key political demands by voting to close
the offices of the Communist Party committee on the mine's
premises.
   Despite these successes, the miners' leaders are unclear
about what to do next. Although they express disdain for the
party Congress now taking place in Moscow, 600 miles away,
they admit that its outcome could play an important role in
their future tactics. Many would like to channel the
anti-party radicalism of the miners into more constructive
efforts to strengthen the emerging system of elected local
government.
   Their hope is that radicals will walk out of the Congress
and formally set up an alternative party headed by a
nationwide figure such as Kremlin maverick Boris Yeltsin or
Alexander Yakovlev, a liberal Gorbachev confidant currently
on the Politburo. Such a split would deal a severe blow to
party authority, they say.
   But a schism along these lines seems increasingly
unlikely. Messrs. Yeltsin and Yakovlev are both cool about
leading a split, and Mr. Gorbachev has been doing his best at
the Congress to hold the middle ground. As a result, most
predict the party will be weakened by an exodus of members
after the Congress, but not challenged head-on by a breakaway
alternative.
   "The reality is that, so far, there are no other viable
political parties, and there won't be for a long time," says
Yuri Boldyrev, a 39-year-old engineer who is one of the
Donetsk strike leaders. "There are only small organizations
formed by intellectuals without a broad base." He recounts
how one radical who has formed his own party, Nikolai
Travkin, met with miners last month. His fierce criticism of
the Communist Party was warmly applauded. But when he started
talking about his own new group, the Russian Democrats,
"people just lost interest," Mr. Boldyrev says.
   Thus for the moment, the passion and political energy of
miners such as Yuri Dubinsky is aimed against the Communists.
Mr. Dubinsky sits in the Donetsk stadium surrounded by
colleagues wearing hats made out of newspaper to ward off the
stinging midday sun. Roaring his approval as representatives
from one group after another promise to join this week's
strike, he holds up a satirical placard.
   "We have nothing to lose but our chains," it declares,
quoting Karl Marx, and depicting a worker with a ball and
chain wrapped around his neck and arms. But the ball has the
initials KPSS written on it -- Russian for the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union.

   No, Joe Morgenstern did not see newsreels of the Flying
Tigers shooting down Japanese Zeros when he was a boy
("Classic Planes on the Block," Leisure &amp; Arts, June 22.) He
has been victimized by two of the lesser myths of World War
II.
   The Tigers were mercenaries who flew for China in the
opening months of the war, and they had no newsreel cameramen
in their train. In July 1942, the American Volunteer Group
(as it was officially known) was replaced by U.S. Army
squadrons, but only five Tigers agreed to stay on. Largely to
hide this embarrassment, the military extended their fighting
name to the Army men who took over their planes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Then, too, the Mitsubishi Zero-Sen was a Japanese navy
plane. The Tigers fought over Burma and China -- the province
of the Japanese army, which was equipped with an entirely
different set of planes.
   Incidentally, the U.S. bought back the AVG P-40s for
$65,000 each. When they read that a Warhawk sells today for
$750,000, the Chinese will be sorry they didn't keep them.

   Poor-Baby Boomers:
   They're Real Stuck
   With Real Estate

   Attitudes on Mobility Change
   As Investment of the '80s
   Becomes Home of the '90s

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS (REA)

<LP>
   They bought and sold homes like traders in the pork-belly
pit.
   It was the 1980s, and hundreds of thousands of baby
boomers, two-income couples with ready access to credit, were
buying New York real estate. Frenzied buyers bid against one
another even for small, dark fifth-floor walkups, terrified
they might be snatched away by someone smarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Buying a home was the ultimate investment: tax advantages,
sure appreciation -- and, incidentally, a place to sleep.
Many buyers never considered actually settling down in those
places. They were pit stops on the way to bigger and better.
   Today, with the New York real estate market suffering, a
generation of people who thought of houses as investments
first and homes second is reordering the priorities. These
days, when baby boomers buy a house, they often are really
buying a home.
   "I don't hear much about the investment potential in real
estate these days," says John Berard, who has moved to
Washington, D.C., and is about to put his New York co-op
apartment on the market. "It's a lot more important to me to
find a place that's comfortable than one that will pay me a
big dividend in a few years."
   Gail Belsky bought a new New York apartment before she'd
sold her old one; finally, after 18 months, she sold the
first apartment and now, staggered, is going to try to sell
the second apartment, too. "I'm certainly not going to raise
a family in this apartment and grow old and retire here. I
wish someone had said to me, `No, no, no, don't buy until
you're ready to stay for a long time,'" she says.
   "If you stop factoring in the home and hearth part of the
equation," she adds, "you fall prey to the rise and fall of
the marketplace."
   That probably sounds like basic common sense to older
generations, who rented apartments or lived with parents
until they could afford to buy what they assumed might be
their lifetime home. Many of them never realized a dime on
real estate. "My grandfather died on the front steps of the
house he came to in 1920," says Mr. Berard. "My grandmother
still lives there. I think that generation was more concerned
about making sure they had what they needed."
   But members of later generations often bought into a
relatively modern notion that people have a right to a
different, and perfect, home for each stage of their lives.
"After World War II, there was a growing sense that a family
was in some ways created or affirmed by a particular house,"
says Gwendolyn Wright, professor of architecture at Columbia
University. "Builders and architects were advertising, `Have
a house that looks like your family.'" So there was the right
house for being a single young person, for being a young
couple, for being a young couple with small children.
   The baby boomers married later than their parents and
started having children later, too. "We had more time to live
in more different places," says Jack Berkowitz, whose New
York loft has been on the market since October.
   And because of ever-rising prices of their ever-changing
homes, they got spoiled. Sandra Marx, a New York talent agent
who's trying to sell a two-bedroom, two-bath co-op in
Manhattan, grew up in a 1,000-square-foot apartment in
Queens. "I wouldn't even rent it now as a pied-a-terre," she
says. "For my parents it was suitable. But we're brats. We
were trained to be brats."
   Nowhere was all this more obvious than in the brat
capital, New York, where people who didn't churn the
real-estate market were considered either naive or just plain
foolish. In the 1980s, demand overwhelmed the area's chronic
housing shortage. Between 1981 and 1987, the median price of
a single-family house in the New York metropolitan area rose
more than 150%, according to the National Association of
Realtors.
   "I never saw anything like it, and I've been in the
business since World War II," says William Thomas, regional
vice president of the Realtors' association. "People were
bidding against one another on houses. That was a unique
situation. That was a buying frenzy."
   Today, many of those same eager bidders have become
desperate sellers. Thanks to the October 1987 stock market
crash and resulting layoffs, apartments that once sold in a
week now sit on the market for six, 12, 18 months. Prices are
lowered notch by painful notch.
   Housing prices in the New York area, which were the
highest in the nation in 1986 and 1987, now have been
surpassed by other areas, including Orange County, Calif.,
San Francisco, Los Angeles and even Buffalo, N.Y.
   The softness of New York's market is "paralleling what's
happened in other areas," says Brian Bragg, editor of U.S.
Housing Markets, a research and statistics publication. "The
prime example is Texas, then New England, and now it's
working its way down the whole Eastern Seaboard. In New York,
where prices had escalated so badly, the chickens are really
coming home to roost."
   The problem is that as people decide to buy a home for the
long term, they want larger spaces. Smaller apartments are
glutting the market, and prices for these studio, one- and
two-bedroom apartments are falling disproportionately to
prices for larger places. Thus, the very people who want to
buy larger apartments can't sell their smaller ones. It's a
vicious cycle.
   The result: "There are some very hysterical owners out
there, and on the low end their hysteria is warranted," says
Susan Bird, president of S.W. Bird &amp; Co., a real estate
marketing firm.
   In New York the bind can be especially tight, as co-op
boards often limit an owner's ability to rent the apartment
out. And maintenance fees, ranging from several hundred
dollars to well over $1,000, are due every month whether the
place is occupied or not.
   Cindy Stebbins, who has been trying to sell her
two-bedroom, two-bathroom co-op for a year, paid $312,000 for
it three years ago and invested $60,000 more in renovation. A
real estate broker told her there were 84 apartments for sale
in the neighborhood exactly like hers, with only price to
distinguish among them.
   "The broker said, `Drop your price and you'll get more
traffic,'" Ms. Stebbins says. "So I dropped it, and I still
didn't get any traffic." She says she would now accept
$350,000 -- if no sales commission were involved.
   That probably isn't good enough. A year ago, Lauren
Tarshis and her husband, David Dreyfuss, put their
one-bedroom apartment on the market for $300,000. Ms. Tarshis
says her husband aggressively marketed it, listing it with
100 brokers, placing classified ads in newspapers three days
a week and repeatedly lowering the price. Still, their
efforts aroused only "insultingly low offers that we laughed
off."
   As time passed and Ms. Tarshis found herself unexpectedly
pregnant, the couple began to wonder whether their family
would grow old in a one-bedroom apartment. Finally, last
month, they accepted an offer of $190,000, $35,000 less than
David had paid for the apartment in 1984. Then the building's
co-op board rejected the buyer.
   "The next house we buy will be a commitment," says Ms.
Tarshis. "People are realizing that like a marriage, you have
to try to make a place work."
   The very process of selling a home these days is so
painful that memories of it will surely contribute to the
future stability of the baby boom generation. "I hate having
all those people in my apartment, scoffing at it and saying I
can do better," says Ms. Marx, who would be willing to take a
$20,000 to $30,000 loss on her apartment, but can't even get
that.
   Ms. Stebbins, who owns a decorating business, says the
experience of trying to sell her co-op has been
"psychologically terrible. You think, `Did I do something
wrong? Was I really stupid to invest this much money?' It's
really depressing."
   Most annoying for sellers, especially busy couples with
small children, is keeping the apartment in showroom
condition virtually every day. Ms. Tarshis says it takes an
hour to get their apartment in shape for lookers, and both
she and her husband have tried to avoid the task. "Whoever
left first in the morning would skulk out because the next
person would have to do it," she says.
   Even so, many boomers still think in shorter terms than
their parents. Mark Singer, a writer, recently sold his New
York loft, has a country house on the market and plans to
consolidate his housing in one place in suburban Westchester
County. He chose a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage for the
new house because he felt he couldn't plan much beyond that.
   "We're a nation of economic refugees, and people here move
with some ease," Mr. Singer says. "Our reaction to this move
isn't, `Thank God, at last we're going to settle down.' This
just proves to us that in spite of accumulating three kids
and a lot of other stuff, we can, indeed, move."

   Debunking Daniel Boone

   Frankfort, Ky. -- I spent the week of the Fourth debunking
Daniel Boone. With due apologies to the grand old flag, noble
pioneers and apple pie, there's a good bit to debunk.
   Daniel Boone first came into the Kentucky wilderness on a
hunting expedition in 1769 when he was 35 years old. Then in
1775 he (and others) blazed the Wilderness Trail through
Cumberland Gap and established Boonesborough. By the
mid-1780s he held claim to several thousand acres, making him
one of the wealthiest men on the frontier. In the land frenzy
that came to Kentucky along with statehood in 1792 Boone lost
most of his land. He moved to Missouri in 1799 and died there
in 1820.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For almost two centuries Kentuckians have been collecting
Booneabilia (some Boone, some bunkum) including even his
bones, which the state recovered from Missouri in 1845. Mike
Hudson of the Kentucky Historical Society has combed this
trove and organized "The Legend of Daniel Boone: The First
Frontier Hero," a collection of the best and the worst. But
not the bones, they lie buried (unauthenticated) a few blocks
from the Old Capitol where this exhibit will remain until
Nov. 1. The displays tell a lot about Daniel Boone but even
more about what Mr. Hudson calls, "the liberal use our
society has made of him."
   Daniel Boone's first PR man, John Filson (who owned, and
was willing to sell, some prime Kentucky acres), touted Boone
in his 1784 "The Discovery, Settlement, and Present State of
Kentucke." This exhibit shows how writers, entertainers,
historians and collectors have expanded on various aspects of
Filson's Boone to mold a Hero.
   With a few adjustments Boone made a wonderful Noble
Savage. He stood about 5 feet, 8 or 10 inches, a decent-sized
man for his time, but he was expanded to fit the role. The
theme song from the television series wafts through the
displays, "Daniel Boone was a big man, a biiiiig man." John
James Audubon met him in the Kentucky woods and reported that
he "approached the gigantic." The exhibit is peppered with
book illustrations that show a towering Boone, muscles
bursting out of his buckskins.
   Boone brought other qualifications to the role of Noble
Savage: He spent months alone in the wilderness, not because
he craved communion with nature, but because hunting deer and
beaver was his chief livelihood, and also because in-depth
wandering equipped him to make knowledgeable land claims. He
kept moving his family away from settled territory, not for
elbow room, or to escape the wicked ways of civilization, but
because he wanted to own land. While his skills amazed
readers in Philadelphia and Boston, such expertise was common
knowledge west of the Alleghenies then, and did not
necessarily preclude some formal education. His spelling was
ghastly, but he could read and write; he signed "Daniel
Boone," while scores of his Kentucky contemporaries signed
"X."
   This is not a kid's show; there's too much reading for
that. But there are some fun things: kitsch including
Boone-logoed lunch boxes, dime novels and a bottle of Daniel
Booze. And there is a collection of pictures and bark
fragments from "D. Boon"-carved trees -- in the late 19th
century "D. Boon" was the Kentucky equivalent of Kilroy.
   Boone as Noble Savage inspired romantic paintings
including a hero-pose oil by William C. Allen that the
Kentucky Legislature bought in 1839 after turning down an
offering from Chester Harding. In the last years of his life,
Boone sat for Harding. That portrait of Boone as an old man,
in the show and reproduced here, is the only authentic
picture of Boone.
   The 1960s television show about Boone starring Fess Parker
presented him as a wise, teetotaling, diplomatic,
"civilized," Frontier Father, a coonskin-capped agent of
civilization. Mr. Hudson calls this retouched Boone the
Settler and includes countless pictures of Boonean coonskin
caps to illustrate the success of this early example of
image-making. By all reports Boone wore a wide-brimmed hat.
   All the same, Boone did qualify as a settler, but it was
not always in storybook style. Two of his children were
murdered by Indians. When hunting failed he worked
more-confining jobs to feed his family, as tavern keeper,
farmer, land agent and public official. He used his
understanding of Indians to mediate with them, sometimes with
little appreciation from either side. On one such occasion he
wrote, "I am hire With my hands full of Bisness and No
Athority and if I am not indulged in What I Do for the best
it Is Not worth my While to put my Self to all this trouble."
He did fight Indians, but not as a crusade. In his old age he
said he was only positive of killing one Indian, at the
Battle of Blue Licks, a needless but horribly bloody affair
that Boone got into against his better judgment and regretted
all his life.
   The authentic accouterments of wilderness settlement
included in this show are worn and soiled and in fragments,
common things from an uncommon age: a five-pointed star quilt
made by Boone's niece, a huge iron kettle from Blue Licks (it
took 840 gallons of water to yield a bushel of salt. Boone
was at the licks making salt in 1778 when he was captured by
Indians and marched to Detroit), bullets pried from a
Boonesborough fireplace.
   Boone spent his last years as a mostly unwilling
celebrity, telling tales and trying to set the record
straight. A Missouri traveler recalled a conversation with
him in which Boone said, "Many heroic exploits and chivalrous
adventures are related to me which only exist in the regions
of fancy. With me the world has taken great liberty, and yet
I have been but a common man."
   Touting common man appears to be a trend now in
historiography. Debunked as the All-American Hero, Boone will
fit nicely into the plain niche he said he deserved.

   She Has Only Herself to Blame
   For Becoming a Borderline Case

   SEATTLE -- The new Miss Washington, Lynnae Marie Thurik,
is a 26-year-old beauty who plays the piano, raises dogs and
has dreamed of competing for the Miss America title since she
was five.
   Disgruntled Miss Washington competitors say she's also a
carpetbagger.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Miss Thurik, you see, isn't a Washington resident; she's
lived in Oregon since 1972. She went to college in Tacoma,
Wash., but returned to Oregon in 1986 to live in the Portland
suburb of Lake Oswego. Since then, she has worked for This
Week, a Portland-area weekly newspaper where she takes
classified ads for auto dealers and real-estate agents.
   Nevertheless, last October Miss Thurik entered the Miss
Clark County pageant in Vancouver, Wash., just across the
Columbia River from Portland. On her application, she said
her work for This Week took her into Clark County for 20
hours a week -- the minimum requirement for participation in
the tournament, which she won. Then, at the June 23 Miss
Washington pageant, she won the whole tamale.
   Now, other local pageants are challenging her title as
Miss Washington. They say it isn't clear she actually works
20 hours a week in Washington. "If you come across the bridge
and call on an indeterminate number of people for an
indeterminate amount of time and you live in another state,
does that qualify you?" asks Patty Belik, president of the
Washington State Association of Local Miss America Pageants.
   Organizers of the Miss Washington pageant defend Miss
Thurik's participation. Phyllis Goldhammer says Ms. Thurik
has attended school in Clark County (Basic Camera and Trim
and Tone at the local community college) as well as working
there, making her fully eligible for the pageant. "Why didn't
they raise these questions last October?" she says of Ms.
Belik and others. And those who know Miss Thurik insist that
she wouldn't bend the rules. "She's about the most honest
person I have ever met," says Mike Olmstead, her supervisor
at This Week. (Miss Thurik wasn't available for comment.)
   But the directors of the 17 other local pageants aren't
convinced. They've sent a registered letter to Leonard Horn,
chief executive of the national Miss America Pageant (to be
held Sept. 8 in Atlantic City, N.J.), requesting a ruling on
whether or not Miss Thurik qualifies. "There are some
inconsistencies in the rules, and we want them clarified,"
says Ms. Belik.

   BLAME BOSSES if quality is poor, workers say. Middle
managers agree.
   Workers at 12 major companies surveyed by consultant
Brooks International overwhelmingly insist they are
personally committed to meeting quality standards, and most
believe fellow workers also try hard. If there is a stumbling
block to quality, look to top management, they contend.
Two-thirds of the workers say "the quality of work done is
not an important measure of performance in my group," and
only a quarter believe "management does an excellent job of
rewarding work groups who make quality improvement
recommendations."

<TEXT>
   Middle managers share the disenchantment. While 78% of top
executives declare "management is committed to achieving and
maintaining the highest quality levels possible," only 52% of
midlevel managers, 46% of first-line supervisors and 43% of
workers share the view. Top managers talk quality "but their
behavior is different from their words," asserts George
Bubrick, Brooks International's president. He cites one
company that pressed employees for quality improvements but
based rewards solely on the number of units produced.
   As perceived by workers and midlevel executives, top
management "isn't driven by quality," Mr. Bubrick says.
                                                                                                       

   WE ARE COMMITTED, companies aver. Some credit workers for
showing the way.
   At Federal Express Co., "it wasn't easy" getting top
management to back a new quality program, says John West,
quality-improvement manager. But first-line and middle
managers formed action committees that proved the process
works. Now, he says, "the small fires have spread to big
fires." But David Shorrock, executive vice president of
Reflectone Inc., insists quality isn't the domain of either
top management or workers. "It's a way of life," he says.
   Neil Keith, manufacturing vice president of Intergraph
Corp., concedes workers in the past had seen management as
indifferent to quality, but Intergraph, he says, pushes the
issue "from the highest level down." Westinghouse Electric
Corp.'s commercial nuclear fuel division boasts it held back
a shipment -- snapping a three-year on-time delivery record
-- when a test that later proved erroneous suggested a
product may have been defective. That, says the company, sent
a strong signal to workers about management's priorities.
                                                                                                       

   HEAL THYSELF] Workers are asked to pick up more of the
health-benefit load.
   Best Products Co., which had been paying the full cost of
medical insurance for its 5,000 full-time employees, in
February started asking the workers to pay a 15% share.
Allegheny Power System Inc. raised employee premiums 10% and
increased the deductibles that workers must absorb. Fair
Lanes Inc. pares its burden by paying bonuses to workers who
opt out of its coverage for a spouse's plan.
   Spartan Motors Inc. turned to self insurance to cope with
its rising cost, and it says the switch is saving $200,000 a
year, about 10%. Detroit Edison Co. figures it slowed its
cost increase to 7% from 15% a year by offering three new
managed-care options and adding deductibles and copayments to
its basic indemnity plan. Still, catastrophic illnesses
confound health-coverage programs.
   Bowne &amp; Co. says just three cases last year accounted for
15% of its total medical-benefits bill.
                                                                                                       

   MASS LAYOFFS jumped 23% last year. The Bureau of Labor
Statistics says 572,143 workers were laid off for 31 days or
more last year in the 44 states that kept a tally of layoffs
involving at least 50 workers.
                                                                                                       

   UNION RANKS in manufacturing eased to 23.8% of employment
last year from 24.9% in 1988, CPAs Grant Thornton says.
                                                                                                       

   WOMEN HOLD a quarter to half the management jobs at 22% of
the major companies surveyed by Catalyst, a group that
fosters female careers. But they have less than 5% of top
management spots.
                                                                                                       

   NO BUTTS. One in three firms bans smoking, up from one in
four last year, says the Administrative Management Society.
                                                                                                       

   ODD MEN OUT. Breaks in career are costly for men. Women
fare better.
   Male executives who interrupt their expected continuous
climb up the corporate ladder even once -- either by their
own choice or because they're let go -- pay for the gaps with
smaller paychecks and less job satisfaction, two management
researchers find. Joy Schneer of Rutgers and Frieda Reitman
of Pace say a study of M.B.A. graduates shows one in eight
men with single job breaks earning $14,800 a year under, or
21% below, males with continuous employment. And they're less
content.
   Women are twice as likely as men to take career breaks,
usually to raise a child, while men are most often forced out
in a corporate restructuring. But the women bounce back.
Their earnings drop only $5,600, or 9%, below the pay of
continuously employed women, and there is little difference
in job satisfaction. If anything, say the researchers, the
greatest discrimination is against women who don't take time
off.
   They need six more years of work experience to match the
pay of men who also have no break in their careers.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: Goodyear Tire worker Carman Davis persuades
National City Bank, Akron, Ohio, to print without charge "We
ride on Goodyear tires" on the personal checks of Goodyear
workers. . . . The average executive each day wastes 72
minutes on unnecessary meetings and 15 minutes waiting on
hold, says Accountemps, ignoring time wasted on surveys.

   The Price of Freedom
   For East Bloc Travelers

   IT'S EASIER to fly to Eastern Europe these days, but it
also may be less safe.
   Before the political upheaval, most Eastern European and
Soviet Union airports were considered almost terrorist-proof,
because the police there had such tight control over
citizens. But U.S. safety specialists say that with people in
the East bloc having new freedoms and traveling more, it may
be easier for hijackers and terrorists to target flights from
such cities as Moscow, Prague and Warsaw.
   In fact, five hijackings have been reported on Soviet
airliners in the past year, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration. Because the Soviets didn't previously report
hijackings, FAA officials say they don't know if such
incidents are on the rise. "But it's definitely a significant
number," says Quinten T. Johnson, the FAA's manager of civil
aviation security division.
   The FAA is reviewing its requirements for U.S. carriers
flying to and from Eastern Europe. U.S. airlines currently
don't have to check baggage as carefully in Eastern Europe as
in Western Europe and the Middle East. "There's no question
that as society controls decrease, opportunity increases,"
says Mr. Johnson. "I guess it's the price of freedom."
   Safety specialists maintain, however, that Eastern Europe
still has a big safety advantage: Gun controls are tight,
limiting hijackers' ability to arm themselves.
                                                                                                       

   Airlines Take Closer Look
   To Stop Bogus Refunds
                                                                                                       

   FOR TRAVELERS trying to sneak out of nonrefundable airline
tickets, the jig may be up.
   Airlines normally refund nonrefundable tickets only to
travelers who are too sick to fly or who have a sudden
illness or death in the family. So, some people unable to use
their nonrefundable tickets have been feigning illness to get
a doctor's note or persuading doctors to give them phony
notes.
   Now, some airline officials say they're checking these
excuses more carefully, by calling up doctors or
investigating the notes other ways. One New York travel agent
was found with a doctor's note pad, forging the physician's
name, according to industry officials. Some carriers that
aren't entirely satisfied with someone's excuse ask or force
the traveler to take a voucher for future travel, instead of
a refund.
   "There have just been too many abuses," says a spokeswoman
for America West. "It's a shame, because we still want to
help people who really have a legitimate excuse."
   Airlines have also gotten wise to another ploy: Many
travelers go to airports and tell sob stories to different
counter agents until they find one willing to give a refund.
Now, some airlines require counter agents to make notes on
their computer system when travelers begin "shopping around"
so that other agents won't be fooled.
   But even airlines concede they can't catch everybody, and
a few say they're not cracking down at all. Midway Airlines,
for example, says it doesn't always require a doctor's note,
although each case is handled individually. "We have a
philosophy of being pretty lenient," concedes David Henry,
customer-service director for the Chicago-based carrier.
                                                                                                       

   Vacation of Vexation:
   A Rental-Car Odyssey
                                                                                                       

   HERE'S a car-rental horror story that's pretty hard to
beat.
   Gabriel Crognale, a civil engineer from Newton, Mass.,
wanted to spend seven days driving leisurely through
Venezuela last April. But when he arrived in Caracas, Dollar
Rent a Car gave him a "beaten up" Chevette that was dented,
had no radio and wouldn't go faster than 30 miles per hour.
"I had my foot on the floor," he recalls. "People were
laughing."
   Miffed, he returned the Dollar car the next day and
decided to rent from Hertz. But the first Hertz car he got,
he says, "died" at a downtown garage, and he had to wait two
hours for a replacement. Then he lost the keys on the
replacement and spent six hours in a parking garage, waiting
for Hertz to bring another car. "They kept saying they'd be
there in a few minutes," he says.
   Car No. 3 from Hertz wouldn't go faster than 40 mph
without shaking madly, so Mr. Crognale returned it for
another one. By now, five days into his trip, his vacation
was pretty much ruined, he says.
   But the worst was yet to come. On his way to the airport
on the last day of his vacation, he stopped at a gas station,
and the car wouldn't start again. Frantically, he grabbed a
taxi -- but missed his flight and had to stay another day.
For his troubles, Hertz gave him a free car for the night (it
ran the best of all five vehicles, he says). But the company
still charged him $110 for the week's rental.
   Mr. Crognale has since fired off letters to Dollar and
Hertz. Dollar says it hasn't received it yet, but a Hertz
spokeswoman says the company will withdraw the $110 charge
and give him a $200 gift certificate toward a future Hertz
rental. "He obviously had a very unfortunate experience, and
it was our fault," the Hertz spokeswoman says.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   MEN ON A long trip are more likely than women to miss home
(33% vs. 22%) and friends and family (24% vs. 10%), according
to survey by Marriott Corp.'s Residence Inn. . . . A new name
seems to make a difference to hotel guests. Occupancy rates
jumped 5% to 7% at hotels that the previous year had left one
chain for another, gone independent or joined a chain for the
first time, a Laventhol &amp; Horwath study shows.

   Management:
   Failing to Win Chief Executive's Throne
   Can Leave Heirs Apparent at a Loss
   ----

   What do you do when you're the crown prince but you don't
get the throne?
   It's a conundrum that can undo even the savviest senior
executive. "Heirs apparent are adorned with all sorts of
terms, from fair-haired child to hunting buddy," says Jeffrey
Sonnenfeld, a business professor at Emory University. When
they don't inherit the kingdom, "it's the first feeling of
failure they've had in their lives. A suffocating sense of
panic hits."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consider Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s John E. Pepper, who became
the heir apparent at the consumer-products giant when he was
named president four years ago. Then last October, P&amp;G
directors stunned Mr. Pepper and industry officials by
promoting Vice Chairman Edwin L. Artzt to chief executive.
   Mr. Pepper, 51 years old, won't talk, but insiders say he
was devastated by the news. He "sees 42-year-olds running
major corporations, and he may feel 10 years behind the
timetable he has in mind," says Mr. Sonnenfeld. "Heirs get
antsy."
   Such was the case with William Kagler who, as president
and heir apparent at Kroger Co., barked orders and openly
criticized his boss, Chairman Lyle Everingham, according to
people at the company. When Mr. Kagler began prodding board
members about a timetable for his rise to chief executive,
Mr. Everingham fired him. Now head of Skyline Chili Inc., Mr.
Kagler doesn't want to talk about his time as heir apparent
at Kroger. "There isn't much good to say about being No. 2,"
Mr. Kagler says.
   Mr. Pepper now must decide whether to seek a chief
executive's spot elsewhere or endure a long wait for another
shot at the P&amp;G throne. He was a finalist for the chief
executive post at Campbell Soup Co., according to several
present and former P&amp;G managers. A person familiar with the
Campbell search says Mr. Pepper was one of six candidates
interviewed by a board search committee. Campbell ultimately
tapped former Gerber Products Co. Chief Executive David W.
Johnson.
   Mr. Pepper declined to comment. But Gerald S. Gendell, a
P&amp;G public affairs official, says Mr. Pepper "categorically
denies" that he was a finalist for the Campbell chief
executive spot. "John Pepper never sought that job, nor was
he interviewed for it," Mr. Gendell says. "Further, he is not
actively looking for a position outside P&amp;G."
   Mr. Artzt, 60, has several years more as P&amp;G's chief
executive. He says Mr. Pepper "is a very young guy with a
hell of a future," but declines to comment further.
   Whether most rebuffed heirs remain loyal to their
companies depends in large part on their relationship with
the new chief executive. Some stay, but in effect retire on
the job. Others try to sabotage their rival as if to prove
the board made a mistake. Still others carve out a niche in
which to excel.
   For P&amp;G's Mr. Pepper, trying to make his mark is daunting
because he's inherited the job that made Mr. Artzt a star:
head of P&amp;G's international business. Moreover, the two
executives have very different styles. For one thing, Mr.
Artzt abhors what he calls "ponderosity," and pushes for fast
decisions. Mr. Pepper seeks consensus among others,
deliberating on decisions.
   Others who have walked this path say it's possible to stay
with a company and work closely with the new chief executive.
C. Fred Fetterolf, president of Aluminum Co. of America, lost
the chief executive prize to outsider Paul H. O'Neill three
years ago, but remains at the Pittsburgh company.
   Immediately after Mr. O'Neill accepted the job, he met Mr.
Fetterolf at New York's River Club to urge him to stay at
Alcoa. "It was clear to me that it was in the interest of
Alcoa for people not to leave simply because I was coming,"
says Mr. O'Neill, who himself had been the heir apparent at
International Paper Co. when he left to accept the Alcoa
post.
   The decision wasn't easy for Mr. Fetterolf, who at first
felt angry at being bypassed. "It was a time of
disappointment and surprise," he says. "I had questions about
what our relationship would be."
   But the meetings with Mr. O'Neill proved decisive. "He was
very sensitive from the very beginning," says Mr. Fetterolf,
61. "He will rarely do anything of importance on his own."
   Mr. O'Neill even offered to establish an office of the
chairman, with all operations reporting to both him and Mr.
Fetterolf. Though Mr. Fetterolf thought that would send the
wrong signals to people in the company and declined the
offer, the gesture nonetheless helped win his confidence.
   Since then, other companies have tried to woo Mr.
Fetterolf away. He still hears rumors that he will leave
Alcoa, which he joined as a sales trainee nearly four decades
ago. But he says he has no plans to leave.
   Often, though, the heir apparent is unable to overcome the
inevitable feelings of disappointment. Mr. Sonnenfeld, the
business professor, describes the period after an heir is
bypassed as the "fallen hero" syndrome, where co-workers
console the executive, quietly saying "you should've gotten
the job."
   Worse yet is the reaction at home. Spouses and children
are supportive, but it's difficult "to face the people who've
taken the moves and put up with sacrifices for his career,"
Mr. Sonnenfeld says. "Now the investment has gone sour."
   At a New York-based professional services firm, the
bypassed heir apparent disappeared after hearing that he
didn't get the chief executive job. Colleagues found his coat
in his office, though it was midwinter, but found no clues to
his whereabouts. Later they learned that the executive had
driven home to Connecticut and stayed in bed for several
days.
   "He couldn't face his family," says Mr. Sonnenfeld. "His
wife was crying because she knew all the time invested was
lost." The executive eventually left the company and went to
a smaller firm.
   Robert E. Fowler Jr., who quit as Rubbermaid Inc.'s
president when he was bypassed for the chief executive's job
three years ago, agrees that "it's tough to be labeled the
heir apparent -- and even tougher to be labeled and not get
the job."
   Mr. Fowler was wooed from General Electric Co. by
Rubbermaid Chairman Stanley C. Gault and assured that he'd
eventually inherit the top spot. But after several years at
the Wooster, Ohio, consumer-products company, Mr. Fowler
found that his expertise in production and distribution was
no longer highly valued. Mr. Gault contended that what the
company needed more was a "marketing and management" wizard.
   "I was disappointed," says Mr. Fowler, who has since
become chairman, chief executive and president of Josephson
Office Products Inc. in Chicago. It's especially frustrating
losing after "you've accomplished a lot and done the things
that were required."
   Determined to avoid that fate, more heirs apparent are
seeking written guarantees from their companies that they
are, in fact, assured of promotion. J. Gerald Simmons,
president of Handy Associates, a New York executive search
firm, says that request comes twice as often as it did a
decade ago. "It used to be done on a handshake," says Mr.
Simmons. "Now they want 14-page employment agreements."

   Why Isn't the Lady a Tramp?

   Women who choose lives like Slim Keith's usually don't get
to write their memoirs. Instead, they appear as glamorous
figures in the biographies of their men, as tokens of men's
success, or occasionally, sirens of men's destruction.
Because they have no career achievements of their own, other
people end up having the last word -- at least the last
printed word.
   Yet, the lives of charmers like Keith are careers in
themselves, crafted day-by-day, year by year. Many young
girls dream of being movie stars, but a few, like Nancy
Gross, who grew up to be called Slim Hawks, then Slim Hayward
and, finally, Slim Keith, aim at glamorous lives. The key to
the kingdom isn't the silver screen, it's the golden
marriage.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps now they are a dying breed who had their heyday in
such good-natured, time-faded works as "Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes." If aspiring actresses are starlets, perhaps these
girls begin as wifelets.
   I ought to say quickly that Slim Keith (who died in April
at age 72) wouldn't have liked my suggestion, but therein
lies the central confusion of her memoir.
   "I've never been kept, ever," she says early on in "Slim:
Memories of a Rich and Imperfect Life" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 319
pages, $22.95), written with Annette Tapert.
   She bases that claim on her proven ability to get her
chosen target to the altar. Never mind that she was Howard
Hawks's constant companion for three years while he got a
divorce. Never mind that when her 20-year-old eyes sight
42-year-old famous film director Hawks she describes him not
in terms of passion, but as "exactly the package I wanted";
never mind that she spent another period of years with her
second husband, the agent and producer Leland Hayward,
waiting for his divorce; and never mind that her third
marriage, to British banker Sir Kenneth Keith, was, in her
words, a calculated deal.
   So, while Keith wrote a book rich in anecdotes about her
life, she missed the opportunity to define that life on the
page -- to tell us clearly the deal she made with fate: what
she set out to do and how she did it. It's a shame, because
this was no accidental life. When Keith dropped out of
convent school to aim her yellow Packard roadster from her
hometown of Salinas, Calif., toward a popular winter resort,
it was no casual vacation, but the launch of a mission whose
success NASA might envy. She was smart enough and tough
enough to lead the life, but somehow she flinched at writing
what was in her heart and mind.
   Her memoir is full of tales of the rich and famous, but
there's a hole at its center where the intelligence, ambition
and sex appeal of Slim Keith ought to be.
   After all, she created a style that had her on the
best-dressed list for years; Lauren Bacall's role in "To Have
and Have Not" was modeled on her; men from William Powell,
who nicknamed her Slim, to Clark Gable to Ernest Hemingway
were among her admirers. She came a long way from Salinas.
   She walks to the edge of explanation, saying that her
celebrity was a combination of good looks, brains, taste and
style. But she gives us precious few examples of her brain at
work and would have us believe it was all easy and
uncalculated. Only occasionally does she let us see just how
clearly she understood what she meant to men. "I was a
fabulous arm-piece, the ultimate decoration," she writes.
   Because of Keith's reticence, when she dishes Pamela
Churchill (now Pamela Harriman), who stole Leland Hayward
from her, it's easy to understand her motive, but not her
distinction between her rival and herself. "Rich and powerful
men were, in short, her career," she writes, after listing
eight wealthy men with whom Ms. Churchill's name had been
linked. She remarks that men didn't have to marry Ms.
Churchill to get what they wanted. Well, Hayward and Harriman
did.
   An unpleasant cattiness pops up even where motive is
lacking. She was thrilled at age 20 to be a frequent guest of
William Randolph Hearst at San Simeon and elsewhere. Yet, a
page later, she's carping that Hearst was a boring host.
Husband Hawks undoubtedly was the cold-hearted philanderer
she describes, but she belittles his films as well as the
man.
   After establishing her pride in not being kept, she argues
that marriage and men are tedious over the long term. The way
she portrays Sir Kenneth Keith, a girl would have had to hold
her nose and close her eyes to marry him.
   She calls Leland Hayward the love of her life, but she
drove him crazy by a lengthy flirtation with Clark Gable.
Poor Gable, however, is rated too dumb to get to first base.
(Well, make that home plate.)
   Perhaps her manner comes of marrying so rich so young.
Perhaps it's a case of what her friend Truman Capote (until
he described her as a nasty gossip in "La Cote Basque")
called answered prayers -- gifts it turns out you didn't
want.
   Some of the best stories Keith tells are about her
friendship with Hemingway. (Or maybe its just that Hemingway
was more interesting than most people she knew.) Poor Papa.
His sexual fears and confusions have been much described and
Keith had fun playing on them. By her account she teased him
for years.
   Neither Gable nor Hemingway could score with her, although
she allows that others did, despite her married state.
There's no accounting for taste, but I wish she'd tried a bit
harder to explain hers.

   MORE FRENCH GIVE UP WINE

   Most French people say they never drink wine, according to
a study by a French wine-industry organization.
   The nationwide survey of 4,000 people was conducted in
March and April by the National Interprofessional Office of
Wine. Participants were asked about the drinking habits of
all adults in their household, and the responses reflected
the practices of 12,400 people, the organization said. In a
1980 survey conducted by the group, 38.7% of the respondents
said they never drink wine. That figure climbed to 45.1% in
1985 and to 50.7% this year.
   Wine consumption varies sharply by sex, according to the
survey. It said 10.9% of the women and 28.1% of the men
called themselves daily wine drinkers.
   Asked why they didn't drink wine, 73.4% of the respondents
said they didn't like it and 25.3% cited health concerns. The
beverage most often chosen to replace wine with meals was
water.
                                                                                                       

   ROBBERY IN BRAZIL
                                                                                                       

   A 15-man team of bank robbers may become the latest
contributor to Brazilian inflation. The robbers stole
cruzeiros valued at more than $13 million Sunday morning from
a federal Central Bank branch in Salvador, Bahia. Most of the
stolen cash reserves hadn't yet become part of the money
supply. The Central Bank said it would publish a listing of
all the serial numbers today, but this may not prevent the
banknotes -- believed to be in small denominations -- from
circulating. Central Bank officials told the Jornal do Brasil
newspaper that the heist was "as if the thieves were issuing
currency."

   JAPAN'S COMMUNISTS
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Communist Party opened a congress yesterday with
an attack on China and the Soviet Union. The party, which has
500,000 members, has long tried to distance itself from the
two giants of world communism by advocating multiparty
democracy. However, its support has fallen sharply in two
national elections over the past year in part because of
public revulsion at China's repression of democracy protests
and the anti-communist tide of change in Europe.
                                                                                                       

   TOWARD PEACE IN AFRICA
                                                                                                       

   The six countries of the Horn of Africa agreed to help
each other find peace. The leaders of Ethiopia, Uganda,
Kenya, Sudan, Somalia and Djibouti made their pledge just
before the annual summit of the Organization of African Unity
opened yesterday in Addis Ababa. Each country promised to
"refrain from any action against the national unity and
territorial integrity of other member states." Of the six
nations, only Kenya and Djibouti are free from civil war.
                                                                                                       

   PLANS FOR EAST GERMAN AIRLINE
                                                                                                       

   West Germany plans to reduce state ownership of the East
German airline Interflug to 51% from 100% following the full
unification of the two Germanys, Lufthansa said. That would
leave Lufthansa, West Germany's 51% state-owned flag carrier,
with its previously agreed upon 26% stake in Interflug, with
the other 23% being sold to third parties, Lufthansa Chairman
Heinz Ruhnau said. He didn't identify the third parties.
                                                                                                       

   CHINA'S FALTERING ECONOMY
                                                                                                       

   China released figures for 1990's first six months that
showed poor performance by state-owned industry. Finance
Minister Wang Bingqian characterized the nation's financial
situation as "still fairly grim," the official Xinhua News

   The Soviet Union and its East European neighbors are
plunging deeper into recession, United Nations economists
said.
   Some radical austerity policies, particularly in Poland,
have led to worse recession than expected, the U.N. Economic
Commission for Europe said. And attempts by the Soviet Union
and some other countries to stabilize activity within the old
communist-style economic system have generally failed.
   The commission said East European governments had
encountered considerable difficulties in obtaining a
consensus for new solutions. "The policy landscape at midyear
is thus dominated by uncertainty. The only certain element
appears to be that the recession in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union is far from having run its course," it said in a
midyear review of the economies of its 34 member states.
   "The problems facing the reforming economies are immense,"
the commission said, "and their solution will take time and
require considerable assistance from the West."

   Japan's Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co. has replaced disposable

hold an inquiry into the conduct of a steamship captain who
was censured for not helping the Titanic when it sank 78
years ago. The investigation will examine testimony at the
original inquiry as to the role of Stanley Lord, captain of

campaign by relatives to clear the name of Mr. Lord, who
maintained until his death in 1962 that he was too far from
the Titanic to be of help.

   Heil Philip: Glass Trilogy Cheered in Wurttemberg

   Stuttgart, West Germany -- It is easy to think Romantic
German thoughts, standing in front of this city's sturdy old
opera house and facing the Schlossgarten, with its lovely
lake and plump swans swimming on it. But it was hardly to
glimpse a descendant of Lohengrin's pet that one Japanese
music student made a five-hour train trip from Cologne three
days in a row to join the ranks of hundreds of other
fashionable young opera-goers clamoring for tickets. Opera
has never been more in vogue with the European young -- in
England, Pavarotti has nearly topped the pop charts with a
Puccini aria -- but it is not that popular. Unless it is
written by Philip Glass. And the Stuttgart Opera is the
center of this American minimalist's cult.
   During most of the '80s, Stuttgart's music director was
the American conductor and Glass champion Dennis Russell
Davies. Not only did the company originate the finest
productions anywhere of Mr. Glass's best-known operas,
"Satyagraha" and "Akhnaten," it has kept them in repertoire.
Two seasons ago, Stuttgart mounted Mr. Glass's experimental
first opera, "Einstein on the Beach," for the first time; and
last month it finally staged Mr. Glass's three "portrait"
operas, written between 1976 and '84, as a "Ring"-like cycle
over three nights.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It was an extraordinary theatrical event. Even the long
ovations were serious drama. And anyone trying to squeeze out
of the narrow aisles before the cheering ended faced angry
scowls and locked knees.
   Evidently, the trilogy not only has survived but thrived
here through radical reinterpretation. As staged by Achim
Freyer, the visionary German painter, designer and director,
the operas -- which portray three great figures of history
who profoundly affected politics, religion and science --
were produced in versions different from anything the
composer had ever imagined for his works.
   Indeed, Mr. Glass has said that the first time he saw Mr.
Freyer's 1981 production of "Satyagraha," the opera about
Gandhi's South African years and his nonviolent movement, he
was so startled he didn't know what to think.
   Mr. Freyer stages opera like a painter, applying his own
imagery and symbolism to the work without always referring
directly to the libretto. Thus "Satyagraha" begins with a
Teutonic kind of tableau, an updated nightmare out of Bosch,
including a car wreck, a fat lady, and a prostitute
performing a manicure on a corpse. A lovely pastoral scene
later on populated by figures of Shiva, an elephant, and an
Indian woman playing with an electric yo-yo, is broken up by
fascist bikers. Mr. Freyer requires three Gandhis: one sings,
one dances, one acts.
   Similarly, Stuttgart's "Akhnaten" is Mr. Freyer's
opulently imaginative view of the Egyptian pharaoh who was
history's first monotheist. At times it is so overwhelmingly
beautiful that its images attach themselves irrevocably to
the music. In what is probably Mr. Freyer's most famous stage
picture, he delicately suspends the pharaoh and his six
daughters in a circle, as if hung like a picture, and bathes
them in golden light.
   Downright inexplicable, however, was Mr. Freyer's vision
of "Einstein on the Beach." Unlike Mr. Glass's later operas,
"Einstein" is not traditional opera but an original kind of
music theater jointly devised, in its original form, by Mr.
Glass and the American theater artist Robert Wilson. The work
itself has no pertinent sung text, and the great scientist's
life is represented through Mr. Wilson's hauntingly romantic
stage imagery -- a train, a bed, a trial scene, a spaceship
and the figure of Einstein himself playing the violin -- all
of it exuberantly propelled by Mr. Glass's repetitive music.
   While the Stuttgart version credited "Einstein" to Messrs.
Glass and Wilson, Mr. Wilson's contribution was otherwise
wiped out by Mr. Freyer, who chose to stage the four-hour
work mostly with abstract shapes floating behind a grid. But
gone as well was the visual and intellectual vitality of Mr.
Freyer's earlier stagings.
   Mr. Freyer ended the other two operas with touching, very
beautiful visions of starry nights, while Mr. Glass's
gorgeous arpeggios drifted effectively into limitless space.
The result was a profound release of tension. So it may be
that with the visual flotsam of his "Einstein" Mr. Freyer was
hoping to make a cosmic statement about the disintegration of
the world. There was, though, something ineffably poignant
about watching a few colored flakes float to the ground
during what was originally the opera's climactic spaceship
scene, set to some of the most ebullient music Mr. Glass has
ever written.
   Still, Mr. Freyer's dispiriting ending to the trilogy
scarcely diminished the effectiveness of the works overall,
especially since they were given splendid performances. Mr.
Davies now conducts in Bonn, so "Satyagraha" and "Akhnaten"
were entrusted to Christopher Keene, who had previously
conducted inferior productions of the two operas in the U.S.
This time Mr. Keene shone, inducing a rapt atmosphere
throughout. He seems to have come into his own as a conductor
at last, a good thing for the New York City Opera, which he
has just taken over. Mr. Keene also inspired the best from
his generally distinguished casts. Gandhi was the tenor Leo
Goeke; Akhnaten was the countertenor Paul Esswood. Both have
lived long with their roles and are fervent interpreters. As
for "Einstein," Michael Riesman conducted his specially
trained German players in a riveting performance that
challenged the precision even of Mr. Glass's own ensemble.
   If Mr. Wilson felt slighted over the "Einstein" business,
he can hardly complain about his treatment throughout the
rest of Germany, where his work is far better represented
than in his native America. Lately he has had four major
productions throughout Germany, and it was still possible to
see two of them in the days preceding the Glass trilogy. In
Frankfurt, Mr. Wilson staged a wondrously lit, minimalist
"King Lear" that at times seemed to produce the mysticism of
a Mark Rothko color-field painting brought to life. It was
perhaps Mr. Wilson's greatest innovation to treat "Lear" as
if it were almost a passion play, with the Lear, German
actress Marianne Hoppe, turned into a moving symbol of
dignity and resignation in death, amid the madness of the
world around her.
   At the other extreme was Mr. Wilson's delightfully
outlandish "The Black Rider," which was created for the
Thalia Theater in Hamburg and that had moved on to the Vienna
Festival. Collaborating with the mordant American songwriter
Tom Waits and the author William Burroughs, Mr. Wilson has
produced an inspired new version of the story upon which
Weber's opera, "Der Freischutz" is based. Each of Mr. Waits's
songs becomes an extravagant production number, in which Mr.
Wilson moves effortlessly between the ghoulishly grotesque
and the ethereal.
   Sadly little of such vital work going on throughout
Germany will likely reach America. "The Black Rider,"
however, may reach the Brooklyn Academy of Music next spring,
and Mr. Freyer's designs for a production of Schoenberg's
"Moses und Aron" will be used at New York City Opera in the
fall. Otherwise you might sample Mr. Freyer's own peculiar
and quite wonderful notions about "Der Freischutz" in the
Stuttgart Opera's production of the Weber opera available on
a Home Vision videotape.

   The Great International Growth Slowdown

   No ballet is as carefully choreographed as an economic
summit like the present chat in Houston. In the clubby world
of international finance, you can dine out the rest of your
career after being a "sherpa," one of the aides who decide in
advance what the industrial world's heads of government get
to talk about. So there's not much point proposing any new
subject for Houston along with agricultural subsidies, aid to
the Soviet Union and the rest.
   There is a broader and more philosophical issue, though,
that the presidents and prime ministers might set the sherpas
working on for some future meeting. Quite simply, what's gone
wrong with economic growth throughout the world?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, Chancellor Kohl, Prime Minster Kaifu and
the rest preside at a most hopeful moment. There is peace, by
world standards, with the threat of war receding. The great
inflations of the 1970s have been subdued. The technological
possibilities are stupendous, promising a new industrial
revolution. And yet, growth is grudging at best. Despite
passing bright spots, the world has not been able to recover
the growth rates it enjoyed from the end of World War II
until 1973.
   This was brilliantly documented by Angus Maddison in an
impressive study for the OECD, "The World Economy in the 20th
Century." He compared average compound growth rates between
1950 and 1973 with growth rates between 1973 and 1987. U.S.
growth fell to 2.5% from 3.7%. But Japanese growth fell to
3.7% from 9.3%. In 16 OECD countries it fell to 2.4% from
4.9%.
   Similar declines were recorded throughout the world: in
Latin America, the Middle East, the Soviet Union, Eastern
Europe. Asia, aside from Japan, was the sole exception, and
may have joined the crowd with the evident economic plunge in
China after the events of 1989. In some regions, growth in
the 1973-1987 period fell behind the increase in population,
so that GDP per capita actually declined -- by 0.3% a year in
Latin America, 0.8% in the Middle East and 0.9% in Africa.
   The question the sherpas ought to study, in short, is
"Whatever happened in 1973?"
   Everyone remembers that 1973 was the year of the Arab oil
embargo and sudden increases in energy costs. As Prof.
Maddison says, "The suddenness of the slowdown points up the
role of external shocks," the oil price explosion and the
Latin American debt crisis. But he sagely adds, "the shocks
are far from the whole story."
   He identifies two more reasons for the slowdown. One is a
change in growth potential, since the pre-1973 period
includes recovery from World War II. Against the growth rates
of 1900 to 1950, what looks unusual is not the slow growth
after 1973 but the rapid growth in 1950-1973.
   Prof. Maddison's third reason for the post 1973 slowdown
was the collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange-rate system.
"This removed the monetary pillar of the postwar
international order," he writes. "Henceforth there was a
non-system," with the U.S., U.K. and Japan favoring floating
exchange rates and Germany and France seeking "an island of
stability" with the European Monetary System.
   My argument is that the final collapse of Bretton Woods
was the decisive event of 1973. With the technological
opportunities before us, the world economy should not be
satisfied with the growth rates of 1900-1950, a period that
included two world wars and the Great Depression. The oil
shocks were dramatic and painful, and no doubt amplified the
basic problem. But they were only an artifact of the
underlying monetary disorder.
   The collapse of Bretton Woods was a gradual process,
measured by the dissolution of the London gold pool in March
1968, the closing of the U.S. gold window in August 1971 and
finally the advent of generalized floating rates in March
1973, a few months before the Arab oil embargo. To strip away
the caveats, the breakup of Bretton Woods caused the oil
crisis. Many observers will find this an extraordinary
assertion; what is the evidence for it? For one thing, OPEC
told us so, and in advance.
   Five weeks after the closing of the gold window, the OPEC
conference convened an extraordinary meeting in Beirut and
issued Resolution XXV.140:
                                                                                                       

   The Conference, having considered the report of the
Secretary General concerning the recent international
monetary developments and their adverse effect on the
purchasing power of the oil revenue of Member Countries;
noting that these developments have resulted in a de facto
devaluation of the United States dollar, the currency in
which posted prices are established, vis-a-vis the currencies
of the major industrialized countries; recalling Resolution
XXI.122 which calls, inter alia, for adjustment in posted or
tax-reference prices so as to offset any adverse effect
resulting from de facto or de jure changes in the parity of
monies of major industrialized countries; resolves 1. that
Member Countries shall take necessary action and/or shall
establish negotiations, individually or in groups, with the
oil companies with a view to adopting ways and means to
offset any adverse effects on the per barrel real income of
Member Countries resulting from the international monetary
developments as of 15th August, 1971. 2. that the results of
negotiations shall be submitted to the next Conference. In
case such negotiations fail to achieve their purpose, the
Conference shall determine such action as necessary for the
implementation of this Resolution.
                                                                                                       

   At this same meeting, the OPEC nations moved to take
direct interests in the oil concessions previously owned by
foreign companies. In reporting these actions at the time,
this newspaper remarked: "Several oil sources said they
regard the new OPEC demands as breaking the agreements signed
last spring, which supposedly fixed financial terms on
foreign oil production for the next five years. At the time,
the oil companies had hailed the agreements as guaranteeing a
semblance of stability in oil prices to consumers despite the
agreed increases." As events unfolded, the OPEC resolution's
"such action as necessary" became known as the "energy
crisis."
   For perspective on this issue, though, I once asked the
helpful folks at Cyrus J. Lawrence to program up the price of
oil in terms of gold. At the historic price of $35 gold and
$2.75 oil, an ounce of gold bought 12.73 barrels of oil. This
ratio prevailed so long as the London Gold pool lasted. In
1969, the price of gold started to creep up, and an ounce of
gold would command 13 barrels of oil. In 1972, it would buy
16 barrels of oil. By the eve of the Arab oil embargo in
1973, an ounce of gold commanded 26 barrels of oil. After the
embargo, in the first half of 1974, an ounce of gold was
worth 12.76 barrels of oil.
   Only for a brief period -- from mid-1975 to the end of
1977 -- did OPEC push up the price of oil fast enough to
improve its value in gold. The oil/gold ratio touched 8.84
barrels an ounce in the second half of 1976. By 1986, with
the collapse of the cartel, an ounce of gold was worth 33
barrels of oil.
   Readers can attach their own caveats to this, but surely
it suggests that the sudden emergence of OPEC was not the
driving force in the post-1973 economy. There was no gold
cartel, yet by and large the nominal prices of gold and oil
moved in tandem. While the parallel movement was not perfect,
it certainly does not look like a coincidence. There must
have been some more fundamental underlying force.
   This force was the explosion of international monetary
reserves during and after the collapse of Bretton Woods. This
is not well understood by economists thinking in terms of
closed national economies, but was quickly understood by
international economists, who see the world as one integrated
system. Prof. Robert Triffin, for example, linked
international reserves and the oil crisis as early as 1975.
In papers delivered that year at the American Enterprise
Institute and elsewhere, he wrote that international reserves
increased by 168% from January 1, 1970, through Sept. 30,
1974. He added:
   "This fantastic expansion well preceded the oil price
explosion of the fall of 1973 and fueled the world-wide
inflation of which oil prices are only one -- and not the
major -- of the components. World reserves had already more
than doubled over the years 1970, 1971 and 1972, increasing
in this short span of three years by more than in all
previous years and centuries since Adam and Eve. If such a
process were not arrested -- and it has not been so far -- it
would continue to fuel world inflation even if the energy
problem could be solved tomorrow."
   Similarly, another great international economist, Prof.
Robert Mundell, wrote in this newspaper on Jan. 31, 1983,
which also happened to be the inaugural issue of The Wall
Street Journal/Europe:
   "The oil price increases of the 1970s would not have been
possible without the accompanying rise in the price of gold
(hence gold reserves) and foreign exchange holdings. After
the price of oil was raised industrial countries and the LDCs
faced the prospect of deficits which would have meant either
deflation or depreciation of their currencies against the
dollar, had the U.S. not provided the reserves upon which the
Eurodollar market could expand to finance the oil deficits in
the great lending spree of 1973-81."
   The reserve explosion continued because generalized
floating rates lacked any external discipline, Prof. Mundell
added. In one month of 1982, more international liquidity was
added than in all the years prior to the 1971 closing of the
gold window. "Balance-of-payments discipline under a fixed
exchange rate system was replaced eventually by the barrier
of fiscal discipline, reached after a once-for-all explosion
of lending exhausted government credit."
   Ultimately, an impending collapse led to the appointment
of Paul Volcker as Federal Reserve chairman in 1979.
Inflation was wrung out of the system at great cost,
especially to developing nations still straining under a debt
load assumed when both borrower and lender assumed further
rapid erosion of the dollar. A world recession seemed
imminent, but was averted with recovery starting in the U.S.
in 1983, which was also the year of the first effective rate
reductions under the Reagan tax program. We are nonetheless
left with inflation above Bretton Woods norms, and the
slowdown in secular growth documented by Prof. Maddison.
   Precisely how would the collapse of Bretton Woods slow
growth? First and most obvious, the inflationary experience
of 1973-1980 and its subsequent correction would be no
economists' prescription for growth. Also, the floating-rate
regime with free capital movement, Prof. Maddison comments,
forced government policy makers to become more cautious:
"Full employment was no longer an objective of policy,
economic growth had become a secondary goal. The top
priorities were to stop inflation and avoid payments
deficits." (In this new orthodoxy, he adds, "The United
States has been an important deviant, with policy action
which has been a quixotic version of the old Keynesian
mode.")
   I would submit, though, that there is an even more
fundamental reason why the present international monetary
regime retards world growth from its potential. To unite the
themes I have been striking, in a one-world economy,
exchange-rate movements thwart Adam Smith's invisible hand.
   All of Adam Smith's great perceptions depend on accurate
transmission of prices. The division of labor, for example,
depends on the trade-off between the product of one man's
labor and the product of another's. To achieve an efficient
result, however, their output has to be measured by the
yardstick of common prices. If there are two yardsticks, and
their lengths keep changing, labor will not flow to its best
use.
   We once imagined that floating exchange rates would merely
iron out differences in inflation and other extraneous
influences, and allow the accurate transmission of real
prices throughout an integrated world economy. But that has
not been our experience.
   Between the middle of 1985 and the end of 1987, both the
yen and the mark doubled in value against the dollar: in
round terms, from 240 yen to 120 and from three marks to 1.5.
This was, of course, without a hyperinflation or depression
in the American economy. There is simply nothing in the
economic fundamentals to explain a 100% change in 2 1/2
years. The same can be said of exchange-rate volatility
measured on a monthly or even daily basis.
   What's more, exchange rates obviously overshoot purchasing
power parity in both directions. Purchasing power parity,
when exchange rates do not affect the buying power of a given
amount of money, is presumably an indicator of long-run
equilibrium. The 1989 estimate of PPP by Prof. Ron McKinnon,
the leading proponent of the idea, is 1.9 to 2.1 marks and
155 to 175 yen. At the time of the Plaza meeting in September
1985, the dollar was obviously overvalued against PPP; in
most of 1988 it was undervalued. This produces disequilibrium
in the various economies, for example pressure toward
inflation and deflation through the international arbitrage
of goods.
   From the point of view of the individual firm, such swings
are certain to swamp the profit margins in cross-border
transactions. From a macroeconomic point of view, similarly,
they are going to swamp such concepts as the division of
labor, comparative advantage and Pareto optimality. That is,
they distort the exchange of goods and services, and destroy
the efficiencies Adam Smith saw in free exchange.
   The pull of an integrated world economy is so powerful
that individual firms find it worthwhile to find ways around
the swings of exchange rates. They can, for example, set up
plants in each of the three major currency areas, and shift
production from one to another depending on exchange rates.
Politically, the seesaw adjustments implicit in this kind of
scheme are a breeding ground for protectionism among affected
suppliers, workers and communities. Economically, they are a
waste of capital and a drain on efficiency. The firms may
adjust, but the economy will produce sub-optimum growth of
the kind recorded in Prof. Maddision's numbers.
   It should scarcely be a surprise, then, that the Bretton
Woods period goes down as a "golden era" in world economic
growth. Come to think of it, the previous golden era
apparently took place during the gold-standard years prior to
World War I. And today, with instant world-wide communication
and 24-hour financial markets, it is surely more disruptive
than ever to try to run one integrated economy with multiple
currencies.
   This is not the place to discuss the economic
technicalities or political difficulties of constructing a
new international monetary order. But let me suggest a few
things:
   A new fixed-rate regime, albeit with very wide bands, is
already implicit in the G-5 and G-7 agreements at the Plaza
and Louvre meetings; I regard it a major failing that the
U.S. refused to accept even the minimum financial discipline
of the Louvre parities, allowing the dollar to sink below
them. The evolution of the European Monetary System is
providing much valuable experience; perhaps Britain would
have found it easier to join a world-wide system than a
strictly European one. In the U.S. there is a budding
recognition that, whether or not a lower dollar helps the
balance of trade, it provides a bargain sale of U.S. assets.
And finally, if governments worry about the loss of
sovereignty, episodes like France's abandonment of the
Mitterrand economic policies or the U.S. abandonment of
"benign neglect" of the dollar leave one to wonder how much
sovereignty they have left to lose.
   A great deal of progress, it seems to me, would result
from the adoption of one seemingly simple principle. The
objective of an international monetary order is not to
balance the flow of goods and services among different
regions of the world economy. It is not to liberate
politicians in individual regions from the disciplines of the
marketplace. Rather, the purpose of an international monetary
order is to provide accurate transmission of price signals
across arbitrary borders, to let Adam Smith's invisible hand
work throughout an increasingly integrated world economy.

   BASKING RIDGE, N.J. -- American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
said 1,584 employees in its Network Services division agreed
to retire this year, under a pension plan that was sweetened
to induce retirements.
   These employees will count toward the division's goal of
cutting 6,000 jobs this year, a division spokesman said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T is determining how many targeted job cuts have been
realized as a result of attrition, transfers and promotions,
the spokesman said. The division expects to announce,
possibly as early as today, how many "surplus" employees
still exist and thus are likely to be laid off.
   A spokesman for the New York-based parent company said
AT&amp;T as a whole seeks to eliminate 13,000 jobs this year. The
company initially estimated it would eliminate 10,000 to
12,000 jobs, but later revised the figure.
   The spokesman wasn't able to say how many of the 13,000
targeted jobs have been eliminated so far. But he said about
800 jobs were eliminated during the first quarter in the
Business Communications Systems group.
   AT&amp;T has about 282,000 employees, including about 30,000
in the Network Services division.
   While cutting jobs in many staff and technical categories,
AT&amp;T has been increasing employment in computer sciences,
marketing and sales. A major theme is to increase
revenue-producing jobs, while lowering costs through the use
of new technology to eliminate behind-the-scenes workers, the
spokesman said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AT&amp;T shares closed at $38.25, up 12.5 cents.

   Kuhlman Corp., Troy, Mich., said it completed the sale of
its plastics operations to the U.S. subsidiary of Solvay &amp;
Cie., a Brussels-based chemical corporation, in a transaction
valued at about $30.6 million plus the assumption of $14.5
million in debt and other liabilities.
   The deal leaves Kuhlman primarily a maker of electrical
transformers. The Kuhlman Plastics Group made, among other
things, plastic fuel tanks for General Motors Corp.'s
Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta cars. But Kuhlman officials
said the continuing slump in U.S. auto sales has been
reducing the profitability of the plastics operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The April sale agreement called for Solvay America Inc. to
pay about $24.4 million immediately, with about $6.3 million
deferred over five years. The price had been subject to
change upon the closing of the deal, but Kuhlman didn't
disclose whether the payment was altered.
   A Kuhlman spokesman said the company will elaborate on its
future plans and uses for the proceeds from the sale in a
forthcoming interim report.

   French Fries
   Impounded
   By Processor

FOOD PRODUCTS (FOD)
</IN>
<LP>
   Tons of french fries and breakfast potato patties destined
for McDonald's and other fast-food chains have been impounded
by a food processor after pieces of rusted wire, some more
than an inch long, were detected in the food at the
production plant.
   Several million pounds of potentially contaminated potato
items left a Lamb-Weston Inc. plant in Oregon, but company
officials told government health authorities that they
believe the items were recovered before reaching the public.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The products, now stored in warehouses on the West Coast,
will be scanned by metal detectors. If found to be safe, the
food may be repackaged for eventual sale, although apparently
not to the company's fast-food restaurant customers,
including McDonald's Corp., Wendy's International Inc. and
Kentucky Fried Chicken, a unit of PepsiCo Inc. The products
could be sold under the company's house labels, state health
officials said.
   The contamination hasn't been announced publicly by the
company. It apparently began in early June, and went
unreported to plant management for nearly two weeks, although
machines were rejecting packages with wire fragments and
assembly-line employees were dutifully noting the rejections
in logs.
   When management did learn of the problem, the plant was
shut down for cleaning -- but more pieces of wire appeared
after production resumed, former employees say. The plant,
which employs about 500, started up again yesterday after a
lengthy shutdown and decontamination.
   Former employees, seven of whom were fired over the
incident, say the source of the wire fragments remains a
mystery despite repeated intensive searches, including
crawling through chutes with magnets. "We never could
pinpoint a source," says Steven Johnson, who was fired from
his job as quality assurance manager at the Hermiston, Ore.,
plant. Lamb-Weston is a joint venture of ConAgra Inc. and
Golden Valley Microwave Foods Inc.
   The plant can produce up to one million pounds a day of
fries, hash brown patties, puffed potato balls and other
potato products. Most of the production during the time of
the contamination was for McDonald's restaurants, according
to the former employees. Some of the fries were being
produced for shipment to McDonald's in Japan, the first time
Japanese franchises would get fries from that plant.
   Officials of Lamb-Weston didn't return phone calls.
   Wire fragments first began appearing in batches early in
June, dismissed employees said yesterday. Mr. Johnson said he
first learned of the problem June 15. "I went into the lab,
just routine, and one of the technicians had gone through a
bag of french fries that had been kicked off by the metal
detector and she showed me this piece of wire sticking
through this fry."
   He said he asked where it had come from. "She showed me.
Then she showed me the log. It was full of all these
incidents of detected metal." Mr. Johnson said he immediately
went to the plant manager's office to report his discovery.
   Mr. Johnson and others described the wire bits as being
similar to bristles on a wire brush. The fragments, found
when employees broke open rejected bags of product, were
between one-fourth of an inch and two inches long, they said.
Mr. Johnson said some were rusted.
   According to a former employee, the plant logbook showed
increasing frequencies of metal-detector rejections. Three
occurred on June 4. There were no incidents the next day, but
gradually the frequency increased, until on June 13 seven
cases were recorded, the former employee said. A company
letter to Oregon state officials calls the period of June
4-15 as the "core dates" for the problem.
   Although four of the plant's five lines recorded metal
fragments, one former employee said most of the incidents
seemed to occur on the french-fry line.
   There was no immediate explanation as to why the incidents
went unreported to plant managers. James Black, administrator
of Oregon's Agriculture department's food and dairy division,
said the department dispatched an inspector to the plant
after his department received an anonymous tip.

   Good Guys Inc., citing new-store sales and strong sales in
all product categories, said its third-quarter sales
increased 56%.
   Sales in the quarter ended June 30 were $65.4 million,
compared with $41.9 million a year earlier, Good Guys said.
The consumer electronics retailer said it will release
earnings figures later this month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The San Francisco company said the increase came, in part,
from six new stores added this year, which brought its total
stores to 23 as of June 30 from 17 stores at the end of June
1989. Comparable store sales -- sales at stores in operation
for more than a year -- were up 29% in the period, the
company said.
   Sales growth has been strong across the board in all
products since last summer, said a Good Guys spokesman. For
the first nine months of its 1990 fiscal year, Good Guys
said, sales increased 51% to $215.1 million from $142.9
million. Comparable store sales for the nine months rose 26%.

<LP>
   OMAHA, Neb. -- ConAgra Inc. said federal antitrust
regulators requested additional information about the
company's planned $1.34 billion cash and stock purchase of
Beatrice Co.
   In early June, ConAgra agreed to acquire Beatrice from
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which had taken the company
private in 1986. At that time, the transaction had been
expected to close in about a month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   ConAgra said the request, under Hart-Scott-Rodino
regulations, extends the waiting period for completion of the
transaction until 20 days after the Federal Trade
Commission's request has been fully met.
   Both food companies received the request, and in a joint
statement noted that it isn't unusual for the FTC to seek
additional information in such a transaction.
   Neither company would disclose what data the agency are
seeking, and the FTC wouldn't comment.
   John McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., pointed out that "normally, big deals get more
attention" from regulators. The analyst added that there
isn't a "tremendous amount of overlap between" the two
companies.
   Mr. McMillin noted, as have others, that ConAgra and
Beatrice are both major forces in the prepared-meats
business, and that the FTC may be scrutinizing the antitrust
implications in that field.
   ConAgra's chairman and chief executive officer, Charles M.
Harper, has said he wasn't worried about antitrust problems,
saying "we think we're below the threshold of their
{regulators'} concern level."
   The companies said they plan a full and prompt response to
the FTC request.

   Regulators in the District of Columbia granted Potomac
Electric Power Co. a rate increase of $9.5 million, about
one-fourth of the $38.5 million increase the utility
requested last September.
   The Public Service Commission also cut the Washington
utility's rate of return on equity to 12.35% from 13%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The commission said it denied most of Potomac Electric's
requested increase because the company has not been
aggressive enough in encouraging customers to conserve
electricity. The company recently began a five-year program
to encourage conservation through $90 million in customer
rebates and incentives.
   A spokeswoman for the utility said the 1.6% increase is
"totally inadequate to meet the company's needs." The
spokeswoman noted that the commission has ordered rate
decreases of about $50 million since 1984 for tax and other
reasons.
   The rate increase, the company's first since 1984, was
intended to cover "all those costs that have gone up" because
of inflation, the spokeswoman said.
   The company said it will consider its options, including
an appeal, while waiting for the commission's final order,
expected in about two weeks.

   Peugeot S.A. Chairman Jacques Calvet said in Paris that
the car maker would be satisfied if its 1990 earnings show
little change or even a slight decline from the 10.30 billion
francs ($1.86 billion) earned in 1989 after payments to
minority interests.
   Mr. Calvet's statement, made to journalists, reiterated
caution he voiced at the group's annual meeting two weeks
ago, when he said he wouldn't be disappointed if consolidated
cash flow for all of 1990 matched the 1989 total of 18.53
billion francs. He extended that caution to net profit,
saying that a stable 1990 result would be "satisfactory."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The main uncertainty facing the sector this year has been
concern about a demand slowdown after several years of brisk
European sales that reached a record in 1989. Mr. Calvet was
calm on this front, predicting that French car demand would
rise 4% to 5% this year. He also reiterated his forecast that
the European market would be little changed or even slightly
higher than its 1989 performance.

it can't reach an accord over broadening its scale of
operations. "Everything is possible," he remarked.

   Monday's report of the plan to seek partners in the

U.S., as well as its North American printing ink operations.
The company had said it wanted to dispose of those operations
because they aren't core businesses.

   Rank launched its bid June 1, offering 90.9 pence of its
own shares for each Mecca ordinary share. Though Mecca
initially rejected the offer, its board late last month
decided to recommend acceptance when it became clear Mecca
was unlikely to be able to carry out the asset sales needed
to reduce its crippling debt load.
   The Rank bid, which values Mecca at #512 million ($914
million), needs regulatory approval. Together, the two firms
would hold large shares of the domestic bingo parlor and

   Legal &amp; General Group PLC of Britain, an insurer, said it
agreed to sell its Victory Reinsurance Ltd. unit to
Netherlands Reinsurance Group, 51%-owned by Nationale
Nederlanden N.V., one of the world's largest insurance
companies, in a deal valued at #140 million ($249.9 million).
   Legal &amp; General will receive #122 million on completion of
the sale and will keep an additional #18 million related to
four Victory subsidiaries that it will retain, the company
said. It said the sale is part of its strategy to concentrate
on its core businesses of life insurance and pensions,
British general insurance and investments.

   Victory businesses, excluding the ones being retained by
Legal &amp; General, accounted for #15.9 million of Legal &amp;
General's #142.3 million in pretax profit last year.
Victory's principal operations are in Britain, Australia and
Canada.
   Legal &amp; General concluded that Victory needed to be
"considerably larger if it were to compete effectively over
the longer term with the major international reinsurers," the
official said, noting that reinsurance is capital-intensive.

   Law:
   Law Firms Link
   To Serve Clients
   Around Globe

   Strange statutes, puzzling regulations and no familiar
lawyer to call. Coping with foreign laws can be an
executive's nightmare.
   Stephen J. McGarry has a solution. Persuade 8,000 or so
reliable lawyers around the world to cooperate in handling
each other's clients. An unlikely prospect, except that Mr.
McGarry has already organized such a group, and somehow
persuaded prominent law firms from Paris to Pittsburgh to
sign up.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We represent about 1% of the lawyers on Earth," he
proclaims.
   Mr. McGarry isn't touting some giant law firm, but a loose
affiliation of 105 dues-paying firms that have agreed to
share information and, when appropriate, refer clients to
fellow members. Known as Lex Mundi ("World Law" in Latin), it
is one of the most recent illustrations -- and by far the
largest -- of a major trend in the legal profession: the
banding together of firms to serve clients who want to
transact business in far-flung markets. With law-firm members
in 43 states and 49 other countries, Houston-based Lex Mundi
is aimed at the red-hot race for international legal
business.
   "Competition is growing among law firms, so it's logical
to assume something like this would develop," says Jim Bunch,
managing partner of Davis, Graham &amp; Stubbs, a Denver law firm
that doesn't belong to Lex Mundi.
   Attorneys estimate that more than a dozen of these
confederations -- sometimes called networks -- exist, most of
them formed since 1980. Some are informal. Others, such as
Lex Mundi, are governed by a board and accept members on an
invitation-only basis. Some enlist only firms with a
speciality practice, such as high technology. Lex Mundi, a
nonprofit group formed in January 1989, is the first to try
spanning the globe.
   Members say it's too soon to tell whether Lex Mundi will
aid their business, but some signs are encouraging. Howard R.
Majev, an attorney with Weinberg &amp; Green in Baltimore, says
fellow-Lex Mundi members in Europe recently helped one of its
clients with financing for a European real estate project.
The client had trouble making contact with European bankers;
the European firms persuaded lenders they knew to meet with
the client.
   And Billings, Mont., attorney Gareld F. Krieg says a Lex
Mundi firm in a Scandinavian country recently helped him
track down some much-needed information on an individual in
that region. "If I had tried to get that by just picking a
law firm name out of a directory, I don't know if I would
even have gotten an answer," says Mr. Krieg of Crowley,
Haughey, Hanson, Toole &amp; Dietrich.
   Mr. McGarry conceived of Lex Mundi five years ago while
working as an international lawyer for NL Industries Inc., a
Houston oil and chemical company. Struck by how few law firms
had reliable contacts outside their own region, he began
researching a wish-list of prominent firms, aiming to enlist
one from each state in the U.S. and from most countries. By
1987, he was making his pitch -- often to wary listeners.
   "The first question I'd always get is: Who else is in the
organization?" recalls Mr. McGarry, 41 years old. "The answer
would be: `Nobody. Would you like to be the first?' "
   Eventually, six firms from around the world agreed to
draft bylaws for the proposed organization. The rules bar
firms from advertising Lex Mundi membership or using it on
letterheads. That avoids conflict with various
bar-association rules; it also reduces the chance Lex Mundi
could be viewed as a law firm and sued for malpractice. On
the other hand, firms are free to tell clients about Lex
Mundi.
   By early 1989, 82 firms had joined Lex Mundi, agreeing to
pay an initiation fee of $2,000, plus annual dues that range
from $1,100 for firms with fewer than 20 lawyers to $9,000
for those with more than 250. Mr. McGarry says he spent
$25,000 to $40,000 getting Lex Mundi started, but
subsequently was reimbursed.
   As president, Mr. McGarry coordinates Lex Mundi from a
small Houston office he shares with a secretary. Each firm is
independent, but collaboration is the byword. Get-acquainted
member meetings are scheduled often (usually in conjunction
with other legal conventions, to save money).
   Information sharing is particularly encouraged. Lex Mundi
computers hold resumes noting the specialties of the group's
8,500 attorneys. If one writes an article on, say, real
estate law, Mr. McGarry can quickly retrieve the names of
other Lex Mundi lawyers with similar interests. Lex Mundi
publications provide legal updates in Europe, the Pacific Rim
and Latin countries, covering everything from Bolivia's tax
system to securities regulation in Japan.
   Some people still can't understand why prominent law firms
around the world bothered to listen to Mr. McGarry, an
obscure stranger to most of them. Several say he simply
spotted a niche in the marketplace, and made his pitch at the
right time -- when law firms were worrying about being left
behind in the race for international business.
   Others offer another explanation. "He is a real
wheeler-dealer," says Allen L. Cleveland, a vice president in
the Houston office of Hildebrandt Inc., a legal consulting
firm.
   Mr. McGarry does talk a good game. An example: "I've
always felt I could stick my finger in the yellow pages and
make a million dollars in three years."
   Mr. McGarry hasn't sold everyone on Lex Mundi. One law
firm already has dropped its membership, he acknowledges. The
firm said it was a waste of time and money; Mr. McGarry says
it didn't try hard enough. Other critics insist the defectors
will increase after they realize that client referrals aren't
always a two-way street. Still others wonder whether such
diverse law firms have enough in common to stay together.
   "I think there's some benefit to it, but I don't know what
the long-term viability is," says Mr. Cleveland of
Hildebrandt.
   Lex Mundi also has some holes in its membership. It
doesn't include, for example, firms from Texas, New York,
Illinois, California or Washington, D.C., areas where many of
this country's most powerful law firms are based. Mr. McGarry
says he tried to interest some of those firms, but concluded
they probably didn't need the contacts Lex Mundi is offering.
   Gibson Gale, managing partner of Fulbright &amp; Jaworski in
Houston, agrees. With 640 attorneys, Fulbright already has
four offices in Texas, plus outlets in Washington, D.C.; New
York; Los Angeles; London; Zurich, Switzerland; and Hong
Kong. It also maintains time-honored relationships with firms
in countless other cities. "I think we probably would take
the position that we already have our own network," says Mr.
Gale.
   But Mr. McGarry argues that most law firms either don't
want or can't afford that sort of expansion. Moreover, he
feels it has more limitations than an association such as Lex
Mundi. "If a Japanese investor wants to buy a ranch in
Wyoming, the fact you have a branch in London doesn't really
do you much good," he says.

   World Markets:
   Tokyo Stocks Gain on Index-Linked Trading;
   London Shares Ease on Limited Buying Interest

   Tokyo stocks rose on index-linked buying, but volume
remained slack as investor interest continued to flow into
the smaller markets, traders said.
   In London, stocks ended cautious, quiet trading modestly
softer, as limited buying interest is proving highly
selective.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although profit-taking checked gains in Tokyo throughout
the day, traders noted that the inability by arbitragers to
support strong index-linked buying was more the reason that
the Nikkei Index closed off its intraday high of 32608
points. The index of 225 issues gained 93.16 points to
32538.28.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index fell
75.67 points to 32462.61.
   Monday's volume on the first section was estimated at 400
million shares, down from 462.1 million shares Friday.
Decliners narrowly outnumbered winning issues 476 to 469,
while 178 issues were unchanged.
   Program buying was tied mostly to the Nikkei Index, while
the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first
section reflected the more general market softness. The Topix
dropped 1.79 points, or 0.08%, to 2362.41.
   The second section index surged 74.69 points, or 1.73%, to
4397.72. The section's volume was estimated at 45.8 million
shares, down from 48.6 million shares Friday.
   Traders said that the market hasn't yet been aroused by
the economic summit of the Group of Seven industrialized
nations in Houston, not anticipating a change in the global
interest rate situation will result.
   "I don't expect anything revolutionary" out of the summit
to affect foreign-exchange rates, one trader at a top
domestic securities firm said. He added that the current
macroeconomic scenario provides "no real reason to buy the
yen right now."
   Until news lures aggressive buying on the yen, pulling the
dollar below 147 yen, institutional investors are seen
unlikely to return to the broad market, noted the chief
trader at a U.K. securities firm in Tokyo.
   As the first section is being "artificially" manipulated
by program trading, he said, light selling should continue
while institutional buying interest continues to enter the
smaller markets, particularly the Tokyo Stock Exchange second
section, over-the-counter and Osaka trading.
   "Unless it's small, regional, cheap or heavily
foreign-oriented," the U.K. firm's trader said,
"institutional investors are unlikely to buy" any of the
first section stocks for some time.
   Of interest yesterday was Mitsubishi Oil, which with
Mitsubishi Petroleum Development will purchase Merlin
Petroleum from Bond Corp. Holdings for $75 million, Bond
Corp. said.
   The news sparked initial buying in Mitsubishi Oil, but
support later faltered for the entire oil sector. The stock
closed flat at 1260 yen ($8.31).
   Soft-drink can maker Toyo Seikan surged 200 yen to 4550
yen, as some speculators reasoned the hot, muggy summer
weather would induce the seasonal rise in beverage sales,
analysts said.
   Retail shares were also higher, helped by news this past
week that retail prices continue to rise in Japan. Ito-Yokado
rose 30 yen to 4060 yen, Isetan gained 50 yen to 4500 yen,
Marui advanced 60 yen to 3330 yen, and Daiei gained 70 yen to
2070 yen.
   Blue-chip shares Sony and TDK continued to attract value
buying, although both shares are expected to see a correction
soon, analysts said. Also helped by index-linked buying, Sony
was up 10 yen to 8810 yen, while TDK added 30 yen to 7360
yen.
   Kyocera was hit by profit-taking after a long run of
advances, closing at 8900 yen, down 70 yen.
   Also lower were steel, construction, mining and banking
shares.
   In London, meanwhile, there were again several company
profit downgradings by equity analysts, adding to the growing
wariness among investors, who may be reluctant to trade ahead
of the U.K. June inflation report Friday.
   A firm pound is encouraging for some segments of the
market, particularly those stocks with predominantly
U.K.-based earnings, but these same equities are being hit by
current high interest rates, dealers noted.
   The resulting mixed picture has sidelined some investors,
although one dealer noted that there is still a surprising
amount of liquidity in the market, albeit in a very selective
fashion.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index ended
2.5 points lower, at 2337.5. The Financial Times 30 Share
Index fell 5.7 points to 1859.3, while the September FT-SE
100 Index was quoted at 2403, off from Friday's close of
2412.
   Volume was light, with 369.8 million shares changing
hands. Monday was the first day of a new two-week trading
account.
   Highlights included Cadbury Schweppes's losing 6 pence to
end at 361 pence (11 cents to $6.44), on a weekend newspaper
report that the concern would bid for the confectionery
business of Switzerland's Suchard, following its recent
takeover by Philip Morris.
   Although Cadbury denied the report, the market takes the
view it is still interested in mounting a bid, one dealer
said, adding, "This can't be good for its share price."
   Glaxo gained 17 pence to 830 pence on strong buying by one
U.S. investor. However, the company was downgraded by a
handful of analysts, reflecting its exposure to dollar
earnings.
   Thorn EMI shed 34 pence to end at 735 pence. Dealers said
21.5 pence of the fall was because of the share going
ex-dividend while the balance was ascribed to heavy selling
of the stock.
   Construction concerns were also downgraded on the view
that they had had a good run in the previous quarter and were
ripe for profit-taking. Redland fell 4 pence to 604 pence.
   Meanwhile, stocks closed higher in Zurich, Stockholm and
Madrid, lower in Paris and Frankfurt, mixed in Brussels and
Amsterdam, and unchanged in Milan. South African gold stocks
fell slightly.
   Also, stocks ended higher in Sydney, Wellington, Taipei,
Manila, Hong Kong and Seoul and lower in Singapore.

   Mutual Funds:
   Junk Beats Other Domestic Bond Funds

   NEW YORK -- The brave souls who tiptoed back into junk
bond mutual funds in the spring are already starting to get
rewarded. According to New York's Lipper Analytical Services,
junk funds produced a total return, or share price change
plus dividends, of 4.1% over the past three months, better
than any other category of domestic bond fund.
   Investing in longer-term bonds "was right for this
quarter, and the lower quality funds also worked," said A.
Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. "We're back
to normality."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the mutual fund companies, which have been bleeding
junk fund assets for much of the past year, the junk market
turnaround is welcome news. According to the Investment
Company Institute, total junk fund assets dwindled from $35.2
billion in June 1989 to $24.5 billion in April 1990, as junk
bond prices fell and investors yanked $6.3 billion more out
of junk bond funds than they invested. But junk fund
investors turned mildly bullish in May, with junk funds
enjoying net inflows of $57.2 million. Fund groups say junk
funds are continuing to pull in cash.
   But, warned Ronald Lout, a bond fund manager at Denver's
Financial Programs, "The {junk bond} rally is pretty narrow."
He noted that most of the quarter's gain came from the
interest paid out by the high-yield bonds and that to date
there's been little in the way of appreciation in junk bond
prices.
   But that was also true for other fund categories. Ian
MacKinnon, head of Vanguard Group's fixed-income department,
dubs the past six months the "era of the coupon," with
investors earning the yield on their bonds but not enjoying
or suffering much in the way of capital gains or losses.
   In the past six months, the yield on the benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond has moved in a relatively narrow band. The
yield at the end of June was 8.4%, down from 8.63% at the end
of the first quarter but up from 7.97% at the end of 1989.
   Mr. MacKinnon said he anticipated the becalmed bond market
back in June 1989, when the yield on long Treasurys was about
8.5%. "We thought rates wouldn't go much one way or the
other," he said. "At the time, we figured inflation was
around 4% or 4.5%, and that a real rate of interest of 4% or
4.5% was a reasonable rate of return. Our outlook hasn't
really changed. I would say that market timing will not prove
a lucrative endeavor over the next 12 months, just as it
hasn't been over the past six months."
   Recently, the dull but safe money market funds lagged
those that held longer maturity bonds or riskier credits. But
for the past six months and the past year, money market funds
rank as the top-performing category among fixed-income funds.
   So far this year, money market funds have also outstripped
most stock funds. Money markets returned 3.84% through the
first six months of 1990, vs. 3.46% for the diversified
domestic equity funds.
   Although junk fund investors were paid to take risks in
the second quarter, that pattern didn't always hold true when
it came to investment grade corporate credits. Government
bond funds tended to outperform corporate bond funds holding
securities of comparable maturity.
   "I think there's a concern about credit," said Mr. Lipper.
He noted that investors also weren't paid to take additional
risk in the money market area. The second-quarter return for
money market funds that buy only short-term U.S. government
paper was just 0.03 percentage point less than the return for
those money market funds that dabble in the corporate IOUs
known as commercial paper.
   GNMA funds, which buy mortgage-backed bonds that are
guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association,
rank just behind money market funds in terms of one-year
performance. These funds continued to do well in the second
quarter, as the gap between the yields on Ginnie Maes and
Treasurys narrowed to 1.2 percentage points. The spread had
jumped to 1.6 percentage points in early 1989 because of
fears that the mortgage bond market would be swamped when
troubled savings and loans liquidated their portfolios. Jack
Lemein, manager of the $11 billion Franklin U.S. Government
Securities Fund, thinks the spread isn't likely to narrow
much further. "From here on out, you're starting to bet
against historical numbers," he said.
   The second quarter was kindest to the small band of
international bond funds, which rose 4.76% in dollar terms.
Paul Suckow, director of fixed income at Oppenda and the
United Kingdom, short-term interest rates are higher than the
yields on longer bonds. "You can go overseas and get a
handsome yield without taking a lot of interest rate risk,"
said Mr. Suckow.
   Dale Rabiner, Bartlett &amp; Co.'s director of fixed income,
is also intrigued by the foreign bond markets. He is already
dabbling in Canadian government bonds and eyeing West German
government bonds. "From a global perspective, our real rates
in the U.S. are the lowest of all industrialized countries,"
noted Mr. Rabiner.

   HOUSTON -- The U.S. agreed to differ with West Germany and
Japan on providing aid to the Soviet Union and China, but
leaders of the largest industrial nations still sought a
consensus on contentious economic issues as they opened their
16th annual economic summit meeting here.
   The U.S. has accepted that Germany plans to proceed with
providing financial aid to the Soviet Union, even though the
Bush administration thinks it is too early for help of that
type. The U.S. favors providing only technical assistance
until the Soviets adopt more far-reaching reforms.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Similarly, the U.S. accepts that Japan is planning to
resume lending to China, even though the U.S. considers such
a move premature after the June 1989 massacre of
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.
   A few years ago, when the Soviet threat loomed larger and
the U.S. more clearly dominated the Western alliance, such
divergence between the leading industrial nations would have
been almost inconceivable. But today, West Germany and Japan
have become economic superpowers, and a cash-strapped U.S. is
less willing to test its commanding role by insisting on
unanimity among the allied nations. Moreover, as the Soviet
threat has receded, U.S. military might doesn't assure
political clout to the extent it once did, and economic power
and success have become that much more important.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said President Bush
concedes that the summit partners will take different
approaches on such issues. "The president has understood that
different countries may have different ways of evaluating
specific changes as they come in and balancing those out with
different sets of priorities," Mr. Sununu said.
   But while the U.S. and its partners signaled their
willingness to go separate ways on political issues, the Bush
administration aggressively pressed European nations to agree
to cut trade-distorting subsidies for agricultural goods.
   U.S. and European Community officials said President Bush
argued forcefully for lower trade barriers in agriculture
during a brief meeting with EC President Jacques Delors
Sunday night. And in his remarks at the opening meeting
yesterday, according to White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater, the president pressed European leaders to make a
bigger commitment to achieving progress in agriculture in the
current Uruguay Round of international trade talks. The
talks, held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
are set to be completed in December.
   The U.S. thinks the Europeans aren't "fully engaged" in
negotiations to cut agricultural subsidies, according to U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter. The EC says it doesn't
accept the contention of the U.S. and many other
food-exporting countries that it must commit itself to cut
export subsidies and price supports for agricultural goods.
"We need to keep the means and policies to support the market
and avoid excessive fluctuation" of prices, Guy Legras, the
EC director general of agriculture, told reporters.
   The Europeans say they believe they are being bludgeoned
by the U.S. on the agricultural trade issue. In news
conferences here yesterday, Mr. Yeutter and White House Trade
Representative Carla Hills castigated the Europeans for their
refusal to negotiate away their export subsidies for
agriculture.
   U.S. officals said they were encouraged by reports that
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had commented favorably on
a recent proposal on agricultural trade made by the chairman
of the agricultural negotiating group, Art de Zeeuw, at GATT
talks in Geneva. But Mr. Legras later criticized Mr. de
Zeeuw's proposal for its insistence on reduction of export
subsidies. Many U.S. and even some European officials think
the GATT proposal eventually may provide a basis for a
compromise.
   The importance that the U.S. attaches to trade talks in
general, and agriculture in particular, is clear; Mr. Sununu
identified agriculture and trade as the main themes of the
summit. He emphasized the need to move trade talks along and
stressed the dangers of failure: "I never want to say that
there is not another bus coming down the street," he said,
but added: "They sometimes don't show up."
   Concerning Western assistance to the Soviet Union, U.S
officials believe the leaders will be able to agree on a
communique that takes account of their different approaches.
West Germany and France favor immediate financial aid, while
the U.S., Japan, Canada and Britain favor a slower and more
cautious course. The exact wording won't be worked out until
tomorrow, according to U.S. officials.
   The U.S. is prepared to provide technical help to the
Soviets. "We have already sent, and our allies have as well,
a number of experts over there," Mr. Sununu said. They are
"addressing issues such as private ownership of property, the
banking structure that is necessary to provide a mechanism to
channel capital to the appropriate areas," transportation and
the storage and movement of grain. Currently, the Soviet
Union loses about half its grain because of transportation
inefficiencies and poor storage conditions, he said.
   The leaders of the seven summit countries -- the U.S.,
Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- as
well as the European Community leadership discussed the
Soviet Union and other political issues at dinner last night.
Today, they are scheduled to discuss regional issues, such as
aid for Eastern Europe and President Bush's recent proposals
to help Latin America. This afternoon, they plan to move on
to debt and environmental issues.
   Meanwhile, U.S. environmental groups complained that U.S.
summit planners have given short shrift to environmental
issues. The U.S. has refused to agree to specific plans to
reduce emissions of carbon dioxide gases, which some
scientists warn could be increasing global temperatures.
   Mr. Sununu defended the U.S. position, saying the U.S.
already has advanced beyond most other industrialized
countries in environmental controls. He also said that 9% of
carbon dioxide emissions come from natural sources, a comment
environmental activists here took as reminiscent of President
Reagan's famous comment that trees are a source of air
pollution.
   "The U.S. must be a leader in responding to the problem of
global warming," said Sierra Club director Michael Fischer,
adding: "The U.S. has failed to be a leader and is using
stupid reasons not to take the lead."

   ATLANTA -- Three men, part of a closely knit group of
computer hackers calling themselves the Legion of Doom,
pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud BellSouth Corp. of
computer information.
   In February, the three men, Franklin E. Darden Jr., 24
years old, of Norcross, Ga.; Adam E. Grant, 22, and Robert J.
Riggs, 22, both of Atlanta, were indicted as participants in
an alleged scheme to disrupt telephone service in the
Southeast.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   BellSouth, through two subsidiaries, oversees phone
service in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Tennessee,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida and the Carolinas.
   Yesterday, Mr. Darden and Mr. Riggs each pleaded guilty to
one count of conspiring to commit computer fraud. Both face a
maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
Mr. Grant pleaded guilty to possessing 15 or more devices
that provided access to BellSouth computers with intent to
commit fraud. He faces up to 10 years in prison as well as a
$250,000 fine.
   Neither Mr. Riggs nor Mr. Grant could be reached for
comment. Mr. Darden said he had agreed to cooperate with
BellSouth in helping to secure the company's computer
systems. Acknowledging that he was "more or less a hacker,"
Mr. Darden said his actions were simply a hobby at first. "I
hope anybody that's hacking out there now hears this and
stops," he added. Sentencing for all three men is set for
Sept. 14.
   A hacker is a person who attempts to gain unauthorized
access to computer files in various systems.
   The U.S. attorney in Atlanta, Joe Whitley, said yesterday
that the three individuals belonged to the so-called Legion
of Doom, a cadre of 15 computer hackers in Georgia, Texas,
Michigan, Illinois, Florida, New York and other states.
   Mr. Whitley said the group disrupted the
telecommunications industry, monitored private telephone
lines, stole proprietary information, stole and modified
credit information, fraudulently obtained property from
various companies, and disseminated information that allowed
other computer hackers to enter BellSouth and other computer
systems.

   News Corp. Unit Signs Unusual Pact for 3 Archer Books

   NEW YORK -- News Corp.'s HarperCollins Publishers
subsidiary sent a shock wave through the book industry with
an unusual agreement to acquire three books, including movie
and television rights, from British writer Jeffrey Archer.
   Although terms of the agreement weren't disclosed,
publishing industry executives said the contract could be
valued at between $15 million and $30 million to Mr. Archer,
author of such books as "Kane and Abel" and "First Among
Equals." Such huge advances for as-yet unfinished books are
rare in the industry, and it is virtually unheard of for
publishing companies to also acquire video rights to a book
property.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Archer confirmed last week that he was about to
conclude an auction of his next three books after rejecting a
$20 million offer from a publisher he declined to name.
HarperCollins, the winning bidder, has spent millions to lure
big-name authors away from other houses recently. But its
previous contracts with authors have been the standard
book-rights-only arrangements, with rare exceptions such as
"The Thorn Birds" by Colleen McCollough for which it also
acquired video rights.
   Mr. Archer, reached in London, also declined to say
exactly how much his new contract is worth, but said, "As I
turned down $20 million, I would think it must have been for
more." The $20 million offer -- which was never confirmed by
any publisher -- might have included world rights, which the
HarperCollins agreement doesn't.
   Mr. Archer's previous novels have sold best in his native
England, where he is keeping his longtime British publisher,
closely held Hodder &amp; Stoughton. HarperCollins got hardcover
and paperback rights for the U.S. and Canada, all translation
rights except for Japanese, as well as movie, television and
audio rights.
   Top New York literary agencies such as International
Creative Management and the William Morris Agency have movie
agents in Hollywood and much experience negotiating for movie
and television rights; most say they would never think of
selling those rights to publishing houses, which aren't as
well equipped to handle them. The speculation is that Mr.
Archer, who was represented by a retired British literary
agent, was inexperienced in dealing with Hollywood. At the
same time, he might have found HarperCollins reluctant to pay
the high fees he wanted without some additional rights in the
package.
   HarperCollins Senior Vice President Eddie Bell, who made
the bid for the Archer books, says he got the idea to buy the
extra rights because he liked Mr. Archer's nearly completed
next novel so much. "It's a big international novel with
romance and intrigue, and it'll be a monster seller," says
Mr. Bell, adding that it thus has movie potential.
   News Corp. also owns Twentieth Century Fox, the movie
studio, but that doesn't necessarily mean Fox will get the
rights, assuming it wants them. "I would love to see Fox do
it," said Mr. Bell, but he added that he hasn't shown it to
anyone at either the movie studio or the Fox television
network.
   The HarperCollins offer includes two more books by Mr.
Archer, another novel and a collection of short stories. The
first novel, to be called "As the Crow Flies," will be turned
in by the author this fall, said Mr. Bell, and published next
spring.
   HarperCollins was formed by the merger of American
publisher Harper &amp; Row and the British publisher Collins.
Before its acquisition by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Harper
&amp; Row was known as a publisher of high-brow and academic
books, with only an occasional best seller. The new
management has added a paperback division and emphasized best
sellers, spending millions to attract such big name authors
as Len Deighton from other publishers.
   After a period of soaring advances and several big
write-downs in the industry, publishers had been holding the
line on authors' advances recently. But the Archer auction
and the recent news that another publisher is paying $12
million for two novels by Ken Follett show that for name
writers, the bidding wars aren't over.
   "This has always been a business of stars, and it's now
that way more so than ever," says Morton Janklow, whose
agency represents such stars as Danielle Steel and Jackie
Collins. "About half the trade books are sold in chain stores
now, and they favor best sellers. As the publishing houses
continue to consolidate, there is more money out there and
it's chasing a small number of proven stars."

   While a torrent of words pours out of the Party Congress
inside the Kremlin, the Moscow City Council has just voted to
take the city's housing stock away from the state authorities
and give the apartments to the people who now live in them.
City Council spokesmen argue that Moscovites have already
paid for those apartments, in the form of the suffering they
have endured under 70 years of socialism. If the plan proves
workable, housing in Moscow will soon be in the hands of
private owners.
   The motivation behind the effort is largely political. The
City Council's reformist politicians figure that if
Muscovites possess private property, then they'll be more
likely to support politicians who aim to protect property
rights, even in the depths of any potential austerity period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Proponents of the plan also argue that owners will do a
better job of maintaining the buildings than the state has
done. They could scarcely do worse. Hallways, lobbies, stairs
and elevators, which are supposed to be maintained by the
authorities, are in conditions resembling the worst Western
ghettos. They smell of urine, the paint peels and floors
crumble.
   Significantly, the plan would allow Muscovites to buy and
sell apartments. Now, the only way to get a new apartment is
through a straight-up swap, involving reams of paper work and
bribery. Imagine the difficulty a growing family faces trying
to swap a one-room apartment for a two-room version.
   The City Council's plan is a step in the right direction,
but it's also a step in the dark. Introducing a sector of
private property into an economy still predominantly
socialist remains a mysterious business. Socialist-induced
scarcity may sink the effort. New owners will have trouble
getting materials to refurbish their buildings. And if they
do obtain some cement or bricks, the goods may be stolen.
It's also hard to see why a tenant would want to sell his
apartment for rubles, a virtually worthless currency.
   But the Moscow City Soviet has advantages on its side. It
clearly intends to make housing privatization the first of
many privatization efforts. Private carpenters, plumbers and
painters are already working on the black market. If private
lumber companies and the like are legalized, and if there is
a realistic way to pay people for their services, then the
Moscow City Council's brave reform could have a dramatic
effect.
   Furthermore, the Moscow housing privatization is a clean
break from the past, and doesn't resemble the gradual,
halfway reform models that we have come to expect from
Gorbachev and company. The city of Budapest embarked on a
halfway effort several years ago. Rather than simply taking
possession of their own apartments, Hungarians had to put in
the purchase order with the state bureaucracy. Naturally,
delay and corruption were rife.
   Last week's City Council vote is more evidence that the
most notable activity occurring in Moscow and elsewhere is
not taking place at the Party Congress, but amid the
reformers who now control a number of local governments. It
is intriguing that so many Western leaders persist in
devising schemes to "help" Mr. Gorbachev and the rest of his
Communist Party colleagues, who are, at best, partisans of
halfway reform. In doing so, the Soviet democrats say, the
West is actually retarding the efforts of those who are the
true agents of change. At the least, the dramatic action
taken by the Moscow City Council to bring private property to
the country's citizens indicates that Mr. Gorbachev's is not
the only timetable for achieving perestroika.

   Ex-Financial Chief
   At Merrill Lynch
   Plans to Quit Firm

   NEW YORK -- Courtney F. Jones, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s chief
financial officer until last year, said he is leaving the big
securities firm by year-end.
   Mr. Jones, 50 years old, is now a senior investment banker
and a Merrill director. He gave up the chief financial
officer's position a year ago after four years on the job.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Looking back, Mr. Jones said that when he resigned as
chief financial officer, he thought Merrill Lynch was "in
pretty good shape." But instead, he said, "The world really
died." Mr. Jones's successor, Thomas H. Patrick, has gone on
to spearhead Merrill's huge retrenchment efforts that gave it
a net loss of $213.4 million last year and has included
thousands of layoffs.
   Merrill Lynch Chairman William Schreyer and President
Daniel Tully said in a statement that they were sorry to see
Mr. Jones go, but that they understood his desire to "seek
new professional challenges."
   Mr. Jones said he's looking for a chief operating officer
position, or something similar, on or off Wall Street. He
said he enjoys working at big, public firms like Merrill or
his previous employer for 23 years, General Motors Corp. But
Mr. Jones said he is through being a chief financial officer.
"It's fundamentally an advisory role," he said, rather than
an "operating officer role, where the job is more directing
strategy of the firm."
   As for Merrill and its recent troubles, Mr. Jones said he
is optimistic about the firm's future despite the overall
slowdown in investment banking and brokerage.
   "Some parts of our business are very much under fire," Mr.
Jones said. "But all in all, I think Merrill Lynch is very
well positioned for the future; it just appears we've got a
ways to go to get through this period of softness."

   Heard on the Street:
   Quality of Du Pont's Revisionist Management
   Draws Raves From Wide Range of Analysts

   NEW YORK -- How's this for a rare bird: A U.S. industrial
giant's stock is being recommended because of the quality of
its management, of all things.
   Wall Street chemical analysts are stretching their
metaphors to the limit to praise the new leadership at Du
Pont, where Chairman Edgar S. Woolard Jr. took control little
more than a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You're seeing the same kind of change in the management
at Du Pont that you've seen in the Kremlin," Paul Leming, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley, says. "You've literally seen a
generational shift from an old guard to the new guard." He
also notes that Du Pont's board has been slimmed to 23
members from more than 30, sharply reducing directors'
average age in the process.
   For the first time, Mr. Leming says, Du Pont has a
management system where "in underperforming businesses,
they're taking managers out and shooting them. You don't have
lifetime job security anymore."
   As an example, Mr. Leming points to Du Pont's decision,
announced last January, to cut 900 jobs from its polymer
products department, as part of an effort to trim costs in
that unit by $100 million a year. The cutbacks followed a
management shake-up in the polymer unit late last year.
   Even analysts who have a neutral stance on Du Pont's
shares are impressed by the new approach at Du Pont
headquarters in Wilmington, Del. "The management is working
hard to change the culture and the cost structure," Leslie
Ravitz, a chemical analyst at Salomon Brothers, says. He
notes that Du Pont has closed an operation that made acrylic
fiber, which the company well nigh invented.
   In addition, the analysts note that Du Pont's management,
while continuing a huge capital spending program, has been
more aggressive in raising the company's dividend and buying
back stock. Du Pont raised its dividend 10.5% in January 1989
and an additional 14% in October 1989.
   To some analysts, Du Pont seems undervalued, compared with
other big industrial companies. George Krug of Oppenheimer,
who put the stock on his firm's recommended list in May, says
Du Pont shares are selling at about 10 times his estimate of
the company's 1990 earnings, a multiple that is about 40%
less than the earnings multiple for stocks in the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index.
   Mr. Krug also says Du Pont should benefit from an expected
drop in commodity chemical prices over the next few years.
Though Du Pont produces some commodity chemicals, Mr. Krug
argues that the company is, on balance, a buyer of commodity
chemicals, which it uses to produce other chemicals with
fatter profit margins.
   Despite the raves for Du Pont management, Mr. Ravitz of
Salomon and Paul Christopherson, chemical analyst at Bear
Stearns, point to a series of uncertainties that could keep
Du Pont's earnings from growing rapidly in the next year or
so.
   With more than $35 billion in annual sales, Du Pont is a
huge company exposed to vagaries in many sectors of the
economy. As a big supplier of basic chemicals for paints and
coatings, and a big producer of carpet fibers, Du Pont has
been hurt by slowdowns in auto and home sales. As the owner
of Conoco, a major oil producer and refiner, Du Pont is
affected by oil price swings. And though the company's
medical products unit is expected to revive from a $25
million loss last year (on revenue of about $1.5 billion), it
remains a weak spot.
   At yesterday's closing price of 37 1/8, Mr. Christopherson
says, Du Pont is "probably at the low end of the range" of
fair valuation, "but it's not enough to make it a buy with
us."
   Mr. Ravitz, who is estimating that Du Pont will earn $3.50
a share this year and $3.75 a share next year, believes its
earnings won't really take off until 1992 or 1993, because
the company now is in the midst of a major capital spending
program. Du Pont, which had capital outlays of $5.09 billion
last year, is projecting $5.2 billion of spending this year.
   Among the spending programs are two that will expand Du
Pont's production of two mainstay fibers: nylon and Lycra.
Over the next decade, Du Pont will spend $1 billion to expand
nylon production in Asia alone.
   But the real snap for Du Pont earnings could come from
Lycra, a fiber that got its start in women's underwear, moved
into swimsuits, and now is widely used in pantyhose and
exercise clothes. Du Pont is betting between $400 million and
$600 million that more designers will weave Lycra into
dresses, suits and skirts, even after the spandex minidress
fades from the scene.

   NEW YORK -- Donald Trump signed France's largest retailer,
Galeries Lafayette, to a lease in Trump Tower, his building
on Fifth Avenue here.
   The Galeries Lafayette store, which caters to an affluent
clientele, will replace Bonwit Teller, whose lease was
purchased by Mr. Trump in April for $5 million. Bonwit Teller
had paid more than $4 million a year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the lease terms, Galeries Lafayette, which will
occupy about 80,000 square feet of space, will pay about $5
million a year, or $62.50 a square foot, for the first six
years.
   In years seven through 10, the store will pay $8 million a
year, and it will pay $9 million a year in years 11 through
16, according to a person familiar with the transaction.
Also, Mr. Trump will receive a "special fee" of about $2
million a year for five years.
   The deal is considered positive news for Mr. Trump, but
it's not expected to alter his debt troubles. Mr. Trump is
currently restructuring $2 billion in loans from his banks,
and he must still service $1.3 billion in casino debt.
   Last month, he received an additional $20 million from his
banks, as part of an eventual $65 million package that would
allow him to defer interest on $800 million of his bank debt.

   NEW YORK -- The National Association of Securities Dealers
fined J.W. Gant &amp; Associates Inc., an Englewood, Colo.,
brokerage firm, $30,000 and ordered it and two employees to
return nearly $196,000 to customers because of alleged
overcharges for securities.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the firm;
Salvatore A. Venezia, a principal and vice president at Gant;
and James S. Gad, a representative and trader at the firm,
consented to the sanctions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The NASD, the self-regulatory agency for the
over-the-counter market, charged that Gant charged excessive
markups for the initial public penny-stock offering of what
the agency identified only as a Colorado producer of a
soy-based, non-dairy, frozen dessert.
   The initial offering consisted of units priced at 10 cents
a piece; each unit included a common share plus a warrant.
   The firm "dominated and controlled the market" for the
securities and used that position to sell the securities "at
markups ranging from 11% to 184% over the prevailing market
price," the NASD said.
   Mr. Gad declined to comment; Mr. Venezia couldn't be
reached. The NASD also suspended both Messrs. Gad and Venezia
for 15 days.
   The firm was suspended for six months from making markets
in and executing transactions as a principal in securities
that aren't traded on the NASD's Automated Quotation System,
unless some part of the securities is traded on Nasdaq.
   Gant previously was the subject of a disciplinary
proceeding; the NASD fined the firm $2,500 for failing to
maintain minimum net capital.

   Bonds Fall on Continued Reaction to Jobs Data,
   Worry Over Today's Thrift `Bailout' Issue Sale

   NEW YORK -- Continued fallout from Friday's employment
report and caution ahead of today's $5 billion sale of
"bailout bonds" bruised bond prices.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly 1/2
point yesterday, or $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of
its price, rose to 8.54%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The loss followed a sharp 1 1/8-point decline on Friday,
which was triggered by the Department of Labor's employment
report. Although jobs growth was sluggish in June, investors
were frustrated because the report overall wasn't weak enough
to prompt the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy anytime
soon. Many investors bet heavily that the report would show
substantial weakness in the economy.
   "The employment report was a big disappointment," said
Lacy Hunt, economist at Carroll McEntee &amp; McGinley Inc. He
said that investors sold bonds actively during the morning
session, but that the market remained extremely quiet for the
remainder of the day with very little trading taking place.
There was very little reaction later in the day to the
government's report of stronger-than-expected expansion of
consumer credit.
   In addition to economic concerns, analysts said investors
were a bit jittery ahead of today's planned $5 billion sale
of 30-year bonds by the Resolution Funding Corp. Refcorp is
the federal agency responsible for raising money to finance
the nation's thrift industry bailout.
   Today's auction will be Refcorp's fourth and will mark the
agency's return to issuing 30-year bonds after selling
40-year bonds in January and April. The previous two 40-year
Refcorp auctions were considered disasters on the day of the
sales and sparked sharp sell-offs in the broader bond market.
However, demand for the securities picked up later when the
bonds were "stripped." Strips are created when dealers
separate the interest-paying "coupon" portion of the a bond
from its principal or "corpus" portion and sell the two parts
separately. Strips also are divided into different
maturities.
   "Refcorp is a very difficult issue," said Mr. Hunt. "It's
a different type of animal and there is some concern," about
how it will fare.
   In when-issued trading activity, yields on the Refcorp
bailout bonds were quoted late yesterday at 8.93%. On July 3,
the day that Refcorp when-issued trading began, the 30-year
bonds were quoted at yields of 8.81%, 0.40 percentage point
higher than yields on the 30-year Treasury bonds.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The government sold a record $18 billion of Treasury bills
yesterday at rates that were much higher than at the previous
auction a week earlier.
   The average discount rate on threemonth bills was 7.81%,
up from 7.73% at last week's auction. The rate on six-month
bills was 7.75%, up from 7.60% last week.
   Traders said the average rate for three-month bills at
yesterday's auction was the highest since the average of
7.91% at the auction on April 30, while the average rate on
six month bills was the highest since 7.79% at the May 21
auction.
   In trading yesterday, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond ended at a price of 102 4/32 to yield 8.54% compared
with 102 18/32 to yield 8.50% on Friday. The latest 10-year
notes ended at 102 to yield 8.55% compared with 102 10/32 to
yield 8.50%.
   Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated July 12. The 13-week bills mature

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   In a report on the global bond markets titled "Sterling
Crowned Queen of the Quarter," Salomon Brothers Inc. said the
British bond market outperformed other foreign markets during
the second quarter.
   The report said that British bonds, which are called
gilts, reversed exceptionally weak performance in the first
quarter to post a total return of 7.14%, when measured in
sterling. When measured in U.S. dollars, the gilts market
rose 13.78%, Salomon said.
   Yields on 10-year gilts fell one full percentage point
during the second quarter, due largely to a 6.20% gain in the
value of sterling.
   In U.S. dollar terms, the other top-performing markets
were Switzerland, 9.77%; Australia, 8.89%; Japan, 6.75% and
Denmark 6.18%. The worst performers were West Germany, 3.41%;
Netherlands, 3.53%; France, 4.47% and Canada 5.04%.
   But gilts weren't winners yesterday. Traders said the
market ended weaker despite another surge in sterling and a
smaller-than-expected rise in wholesale prices.
   Traders attributed the drop in gilts mostly to technical
factors, including the September long-term gilt futures
contract's move below a key support level.
   Among benchmark gilts, the 11.75% bond due 2003/2007 fell
nearly 1/2 point to 100 15/32 to yield 11.68% while 12% notes
due 1995 fell 3/8 to 98 26/32 to yield 12.35%. (These yields
are quoted in local terms and therefore differ somewhat from
yields calculated for these markets by U.S. investment firms,
which tend to use the semiannual compound measure to compare
yields across markets.)
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Bucking the trend in the broader bond market, junk bonds
ended slightly firmer yesterday. Most junk bonds, high-yield
speculative grade securities that have low credit ratings or
no credit ratings at all, ended between 1/8 and 1/4 point
higher.
   The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. led the market. The
pay-in-kind bonds of RJR Nabisco posted gains on reports that
the company was deluged with $7 billion in loan commitments
from banks for its debt refinancing plan. Pay-in-kind bonds
pay interest in the form of additional securities.
   The food and tobacco concern plans to use $2.25 billion in
bank loans to help buy back some of its most troublesome
high-yield issues, the pay-in-kind bonds that must be reset
to trade at par by next April.
   The company's 14.07% convertible pay-in-kind debentures
due in 2009 finished 7/8 point higher to close at 104 1/2 on
the New York Stock Exchange. The 14.07% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures maturing in 2007 ended 5/8 point lower
to close at 85 5/8.
   Prices of investment grade bonds fell between 1/8 and 3/8
point.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities

   Mortgage securities prices continued their recent slide on
the heels of the Treasury market, although losses in mortgage
securities were less pronounced.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, Government
National Mortgage Association 10% issues were down 6/32 at
101 11/32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities
were down 5/32 at 98 11/32 and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9.5% securities were off 5/32 at 98 27/ 32.
   In the primary market for mortgage-backed securities,
pricing details were announced for three real estate mortgage
investment conduits now being traded,for a total of $1.3
billion.
   A $500 million issue of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
Remics is being offered by Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
The offering is backed by Freddie Mac 9.5% securities.
   A $400 million issue of Federal National Mortgage
Association Remics is being offered by Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.,
backed by Fannie Mae 9.5% securities.
   And a $400 million Remic issue from Denver-based Fund
America Investors Corp. is being backed by Ginnie Mae 10%
securities and offered by Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues ended 1/8 to 1/4 point lower.
   In new issue activity, a First Southwest Co. group set the
preliminary pricing for an issue of $50 million Texas
zero-coupon college student loan bonds.
   The bonds were priced to yield to maturity from 6.20% in
1992 to 7.25% in 2006 to 2009.
   This week more than $2 billion in new issues are scheduled
to be priced.
   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 were off 1/8 point at 98 5/8 to
yield 7.30%.

   NEW YORK -- General Instrument Corp. said a potential
bidder has emerged that may be interested in topping a $1.42
billion, $44.50-a-share bid for the company by Forstmann,
Little &amp; Co.
   The cable TV equipment maker said an unnamed "financial
entity" has expressed interest in obtaining information about
the company and evaluating a possible transaction. But it
said there aren't any negotiations under way.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In response to the disclosure, General Instrument stock
rose 62.5 cents to $46.25 a share in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Although the stock is trading well above the Forstmann
Little offer, some takeover stock traders are skeptical that
a higher bid will emerge. These traders and some investment
bankers say the company had already been offered informally
for sale during the past year without attracting any other
bids.
   Documents filed with Forstmann Little's offer said
Forstmann's advisers, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Lazard Freres
&amp; Co., will share a fee of $8 million if the purchase is
completed. General Instrument's adviser, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
stands to receive a fee of roughly $8 million based on the
current offer and more if shareholders receive a higher
price.

   NEW YORK -- Saul S. Cohen, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group
Inc.'s former top internal cop and one of Wall Street's
best-paid lawyers, bolted the securities business to rejoin
his former law firm.
   But don't expect Mr. Cohen to apologize for the $2
million-a-year salary package he worked out at Drexel in
April 1989 -- a deal that spun heads even on Wall Street. He
now bills clients a fat $450 an hour at Rosenman &amp; Colin, a
New York law firm he rejoined after a one-year hiatus.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You're not taken seriously {among investment bankers}
unless you make lots of money," says Mr. Cohen. "I was the
most expensive . . . general counsel in the universe, and
they knew it," he adds. "It conveyed authority."
   Mr. Cohen was brought in as Drexel's general counsel last
year to help the firm comply with its settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Drexel pleaded guilty to
six felonies and agreed last year to pay $650 million in
fines and penalties.
   Much of Mr. Cohen's Drexel stash, however, is tied up in
court: Drexel, which filed for bankruptcy-law protection in
February, still owes him $5.25 million of a four-year, $8
million package, Mr. Cohen says.
   At Drexel, the brash Mr. Cohen was known as a hard
bargainer in Drexel's settlements with state regulators to
keep the firm open for business. Before Drexel's collapse,
Mr. Cohen negotiated settlements with 43 states totaling
about $8 million. His duties at Drexel included compliance
control and reorganizing the firm's legal department.
   His biggest challenge: Addressing the lax compliance tone
at Drexel. "If there's one place where they failed, that's
it," he says.
   Drexel wasn't his first big challenge. For several years,
Mr. Cohen has been the court-appointed trustee for Bevill,
Bresler &amp; Schulman Inc., a broker-dealer that filed for
bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   The 53-year-old Mr. Cohen originally joined Rosenman &amp;
Colin from Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., where he had been
general counsel. He also had been general counsel at A.G.
Edwards &amp; Sons and is former president of the Securities
Industry Association's legal and compliance division.
   Back at Rosenman &amp; Colin, Mr. Cohen will focus on
securities litigation and compliance. The firm's brokerage
clients include, among others, Bear Stearns Cos., Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc., Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
First Boston Corp. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

   BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Nike Inc. said it's now king of the
fitness hill, dethroning Adidas as the best-selling brand in
athletic footwear and apparel.
   Nike also topped its own earnings estimates, posting
record results for the fourth quarter and year as fitness
fans around the world continued to snap up the company's
sports shoes and clothes. Nike said net income for the
quarter ended May 31 surged 84% to a record $67.2 million, or
$1.77 a share, from $36.5 million, or 97 cents a share, the
year earlier. Late last month, the company estimated that net
was between $64 million and $66 million.

   Wall Street responded yesterday by pushing up Nike's stock
by 9.1%; it closed in national over-the-counter trading at
$87.25, up $7.25, on volume of 1,571,200 shares.
   Revenue in the quarter spurted 47% to a high of $609
million from $413.4 million a year earlier, Nike said.
   Nike claimed the title for the world's biggest
athletic-brand sales on record full-year revenue of $2.24
billion. That compares with sales under the Adidas brand name
estimated at about $1.7 billion, a Nike spokewoman said. Nike
added that it also outstripped its biggest domestic
competitor, Reebok International Ltd. For fiscal 1989, Nike's
sales totaled $1.71 billion.
   For fiscal 1990, Nike earned a record $243 million, or
$6.42 a share, up 45% from $167 million, or $4.45 a share, a
year earlier. Last month, Nike said it expected to post net
for the year of $240 million to $242 million.

   Three shareholders of Mack Trucks Inc. filed a lawsuit
alleging that the proposed $99-million buy-out of the company
by Renault Vehicules Industriels is unfair.
   Renault, a unit of state-owned Regie Nationale des Usines
Renault, announced earlier that it plans to start a
$6-a-share tender offer Thursday for the 55% of Mack it
doesn't own. Filed in federal court in Philadelphia, the suit
alleges that an announcement of Mack's poor financial outlook
on the same day was an effort "to lull {investors} into
having a belief that the most that they were entitled to" was
the Renault offer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suit, which names Mack and Renault as defendants, asks
the court to order Renault to divest itself of any benefits
it may obtain from the alleged scheme. It seeks class-action
status. The plaintiffs are Barbara Zarowitz, Lepow Equities
and Peter Stuyvesant Ltd.
   A spokesman for Mack, based in Allentown, Pa., declined to
comment on the suit. Renault, based in Paris, couldn't be
reached for comment last evening.

   Commodities:
   Sugar Prices Register Sharp Drop After Reports
   That Production Levels Will Exceed Forecasts

   Sugar prices dropped precipitously yesterday in the face
of reports predicting higher production levels than
previously expected.
   The October contract settled at 11.90 cents a pound, off
0.69 cent. It had opened trading about 0.17 cents a pound
below Friday's close. The opening price was also the high for
the day, but the contract quickly dropped under pressure from
commodity funds liquidating long positions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Before the market opened, a report from the European
Community estimated that the Western Europe beet crop would
increase by less than 1%, or 106,000 metric tons, from an
earlier estimate. Also yesterday,the Brazilian government
authorized a sugar output for the 1990-91 crop year of 6.85
million metric tons, up from its previous authorization of
6.44 million metric tons.
   "Those two bits of news were very poor excuses to sell the
market off 0.69 cent," said Judith Ganes, sugar analyst at
Merrill Lynch Futures in New York. Rather, she said, "I think
the whole move down has been because of speculative selling
and fund liquidation."
   Ms. Ganes said she thought that the market wasn't aware
yet of more, potentially bearish news contained in yet
another production report dated yesterday by F.O. Licht, a
German firm that prepares world-wide crop estimates for
sugar.
   The new Licht report estimates that West European beet
production for the 1990-91 crop year could increase by as
much as one million metric tons over the 1989-90 harvest,
Barring any unforeseen weather disasters,. The new report
also predicts that the crop in Eastern Europe could increase,
but there is more uncertainty concerning that forecast.
   Ms. Ganes said the Brazilian announcement should have had
little or no effect on prices since the U.S. Agriculture
Department had pegged the Brazilian crop at 7.5 million
metric tons, while Licht had estimated it at 8.2 million
tons.
   Harry Schwartz, commodity analyst at Cargill Investors
Services in New York, said he was surprised by the Brazilian
authorization news. "I thought they would make a bearish
announcement like that only in a rising market, never in a
market that had sold off more than 0.70 cent on Thursday and
Friday," he said.
   Mr. Schwartz also pointed out that sugar's price decline
gained momentum by stop-loss orders that were triggered as
the selling ensued. "If we have a couple of more closes under
12 cents, I think that will generate some additional
computer-generated selling by funds," he said.
   Arthur Stevenson, sugar analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities, attributed the market decline to waves of
technical selling that took out the low prices set four weeks
ago. He said he would not be surprised to see the market drop
to the area of 11.50 cents to 11.25 cents a pound.
   Ms. Ganes said that though the crop outlook has improved
and the supply-demand balance is certainly not going to be as
tight as previously feared, it doesn't mean the market is
approaching a condition of great surplus. "Any problems with
production and this market could rebound in a hurry," she
added.
   The new Licht report pointed out that consumption this
year was kept artificially low in certain countries because
of tight supplies. It concluded that an increase in output in
those countries does not necessarily mean a sharp addition to
stocks, but is likely to go directly into consumption.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Mixed weather forecasts calling for
possible resurgence of cool, moist conditions in some Midwest
growing regions halted last week's slide in the price of corn
futures contracts. Concern that the weather might hinder
pollination of the young crop helped corn futures prices to
bounce back. After declining sharply Thursday and Friday, the
price of the December corn contract was up slightly
yesterday. For soybean futures, weather forecasts had less
impact, as the price of the November contract declined 3.25
cents a bushel. That's because the soybean crop has longer to
develop, and any short-term wet weather is less likely to
damage it, said Richard Loewy, president of AgResource Co.,
Chicago. An additional drain on the price of soybeans is
competition from growers in South America, he said.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of pork belly futures
contracts fell the daily limit of two cents a pound yesterday
on higher-than-expected slaughtering of hogs. Traders expect
a cold storage report due out today to show lower-than-normal
movement of frozen bellies, which are used to make bacon, out
of cold storage, because of the over-supply of fresh bellies
from slaughter, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling
Research, Arlington Heights, Ill. "We think that pork prices
overall made their highs earlier than normal this year," Mr.
Morgan said. "Normally they peak in July or August, and this
year we think they peaked in May and June." Pork prices
became so high in those months, he said, that consumers
turned away from pork in favor of beef and chicken.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Prices continued the sell-off that began last
week. Yesterday was the last trading day for the expiring
July contract, which, after setting a high of 92.20 cents a
pound, closed at 90 cents. Some traders had expected price
fireworks in the expiring contract, but one analyst
characterized the expiration as a non-event. The October
contract, which has characteristics of both the old crop and
the new crop, set a high of 79.16 cents for the day and then
reversed direction. It spent most of the day at 76.74 cents,
down two cents, the daily limit that cotton prices are
permitted to rise or fall. At the close, it was estimated
that there were 200 contracts offered at the limit price. The
new-crop December contract opened in a price range just above
Friday's close, and then rallied to 74.35 cents before
commission houses and independent traders forced it down the
limit. It managed to rebound slightly and settle at 71.95
cents, down 1.67 cents. Thomas Mueller, cotton specialist at
Merrill Lynch Futures in New York, says the market is
probably reacting to forecasts for rain for later in the week
in West Texas, the Delta and the Southeast. He also said that
many in the market had written off the West Texas crop, but
that he thought it was far too early to take such a stance.
"I expect a great Delta crop," he added.

   LONDON -- The British pound surged on world currency
markets, as bullish signals from the U.K. government gave an
extra kick to a four-month-long rise in the sterling's value.
   At the peak of trading here yesterday morning, the pound
gained 3.36 yen to 273.4 yen -- its highest level against the
Japanese currency since early 1986. Similarly, against the
U.S. dollar, the pound soared by 2.4 cents during the morning
to an 18month high of $1.8127. Against the mark, the pound's
3.12-pfennig rise pushed it to a nine-month high of 2.9850
marks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By the end of the day in London, the buying craze that
began in Tokyo had lost some steam. But London currency
traders forecast that the pound's rise isn't over yet. Since
March 21, the pound has climbed 14% against the dollar and
10% against the mark. And though profit-taking in coming days
may briefly interrupt the pound's climb, "most people still
feel there's room for it {sterling} to go further" up in
value, said analyst Peter Spencer of Shearson Lehman Hutton
Securities in London.
   The main reason for the pound's climb is politics. Since
March, the ruling Conservative Party has narrowed its lag
behind the Labor Party in British opinion polls -- raising
the odds of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher surviving next
year's expected general elections.
   More importantly, the government has been sending the
currency markets increasingly bullish signals that it plans a
speedy entry into the European Monetary System's exchange
rate mechanism, or ERM. In that system, participating
governments agree to hold their currencies on
foreign-exchange markets within a narrow band of pre-assigned
values. The pound's entry into ERM, economists say, would
help stablize the volatile currency and control Britain's
steep, 9%-plus rate of inflation. The anticipation of ERM
entry -- perhaps by year end -- has put a rocket under the
pound in recent weeks.
   The immediate trigger for yesterday's surge were reports
in London's Sunday Times and yesterday's Independent
newspapers that the British Treasury doesn't plan any quick
interest-rate cuts and is plotting its specific strategy for
ERM entry. A Treasury spokesman in London dismissed the
articles as mere "speculation." But at the economic summit in
Houston his boss, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major,
added further fuel to the fire by suggesting that the pound's
recent rise is sustainable.
   Several London analysts believe Mr. Major and his aides
are deliberately "talking up" the pound's value. "They're
very keen to get the exchange rate up" to control U.K.
inflation, said London analyst Robin Marshall of Chase
Investment Bank Ltd.
   The ruling Tories are struggling to cut the country's
steep inflation rate -- a politically potent issue. One
relatively minor report on inflation came yesterday, when the
government announced that British producer prices rose 0.2%
in June from Maywhich translates into a less-than-expected
6.2% annual rate. But the next major inflation report may
embarrass the Tories. On Friday, private economists predict,
the government may report retail price inflation accelerated
in June to slightly less than 10%.
   Hyping the pound is one of the Tories' last available
inflation-fighting tools, Chase's Mr. Marshall said. They
can't use their customary weapon, raising interest rates,
without risking a recession and political grief; U.K. bank
base rates are already at a stratospheric 15%. In the short
term, a strong pound fights inflation by lowering the cost to
British industry of imported supplies. It also makes U.K.
products more expensive abroad and thereby curbs British
corporate profits and wage increases. The London stock
market, anticipating the pound's effect on corporate profits,
slipped in light trading. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index fell 2.5 points to 2337.5.
   Still, some London economists grumble that the Tories' new
inflation weapon has big risks and that the currency markets
are overly optimistic. The pound "is starting to look
overextended," said London-based analyst Mark Austin of
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. While he expects the
pound's value to pass three marks, he warns that any bad
political news could easily short-circuit the climb.
   One opportunity for trouble, he says, will be the
publication July 26 of a book by Sir Alan Walters, an ERM
critic and Mrs. Thatcher's ex-economics adviser. The book, he
says, could reopen the debate within the Tory Party over ERM
membership -- and shake market assumptions about the terms
and speed of Britain's ERM entry.
   But currency traders weren't in the mood for cautious
counsel. Even after profit-taking in the afternoon here
damped the morning's rise, the pound ended the day in London
at $1.8045, up 1.7 cents from Friday's close. Against the
yen, the pound settled here at 272.47 yen, up 2.38 yen.
Against the mark, the pound late yesterday was trading here
at 2.9767 marks, up 2.11 pfennigs.
   In late New York trading, the pound was quoted at $1.8080,
up from $1.7860 Friday and at 2.9886 marks, up from 2.9505
marks. The dollar stood at 1.6530 marks, up 0.0010 from
Friday's quote, and at 151.15 yen, off 0.55.
   In Tokyo early Tuesday, the dollar was trading at 150.55
yen soon after the opening, down a bit from Monday's Tokyo
close of 150.70 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading
at 1.6490 marks, up slightly from Monday's Tokyo close of
1.6487 marks.
   Over the next month, Chase's Mr. Marshall predicted, the
pound will likely climb further. "We all know that it's
overvalued. But it takes a lot of courage to stand in the way
of it" and sell the pound for fear of losing out on a further
climb, he said. He warned, however, that the eventual
fallperhaps late this year when Britain actually joins the
ERM and traders rush to cash in their gains -- will be steep
and fast.
   "Once it {the pound} turns around, it could be: `Last man
out, turn off the lights,' " he said.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$357.35 an ounce.

   NEW YORK -- The number of corporate name changes dropped
14% in 1989 from 1988, to 1,600 from a record 1,864, with
half the latest total reflecting mergers and acquisitions,
said Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc., a consulting firm.
   For example, a pair of combinations -- Time Inc. with
Warner Communications Inc., and Bristol-Myers Co. with Squibb
Corp. -- produced Time Warner Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Elective name changes -- those made for reasons other than
merger, downsizing or reorganization -- represented 16% of
the total, the consultants said. Among them in 1989 were Gulf
&amp; Western Inc. becoming Paramount Communications Inc. and
Home Group Inc. taking on the name AmBase Corp., the firm
said.
   Companies also change their names to reflect their entry
into or withdrawal from markets and to take advantage of a
particularly prominent product. One-quarter of the changes in
1989 were spurred by divestitures, asset sales, spinoffs and
leveraged buy-outs, the firm said. F.W. Woolworth Co.
switched to Woolworth Corp. when it became a holding company.
   Acquisitions of U.S. firms by foreign firms led to
Stauffer Chemical Corp. becoming Rhone-Poulenc Basic
Chemicals Inc. and Pennwalt Corp. becoming Atochem.

   STAMFORD, Conn. -- General Signal Corp. said it agreed to
sell its Ultratech Stepper unit to an employee group in a
cash and paper transaction in which it will retain a minority
interest. Precise terms weren't disclosed.
   General Signal, a maker of process controls, electrical
equipment and semiconductors, said Ultratech Stepper
accounted for about $40 million of its 1989 sales of $1.92
billion. A stepper is a photolithography tool used to put
circuit designs on semiconductors.

<TEXT>
   C. Woodrow Rea, a general partner in New Enterprise
Associates, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm and a
former president of Ultratech, heads the employee group.
Under the pact, General Signal will provide "significant
financing."
   General Signal had planned to combine Ultratech, based in
San Francisco, with General Signal's GCA Stepper unit, which
has about twice the sales of Ultratech. The agreement to sell
Ultratech, with about 300 employees, "was a more attractive
alternative to the risks associated" with the merger plan, a
General Signal official said.
   The transaction will allow General Signal "to focus its
research and marketing efforts" on the world-wide market for
GCA Stepper's technology.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The timber industry urged the
government yesterday to reject a spotted-owl protection
strategy proposed by government scientists, saying it would
cost 102,000 jobs and turn some towns into rural ghettos.
   Researchers commissioned by the American Forest Resource
Alliance said logging communities in Washington, Oregon and
Northern California accept the need to reduce timber harvests
to protect the environment. But they said the government
should consider human as well as environmental needs in
developing a plan for the endangered owl.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Yeah, we're going to lose jobs," said John Beuter, a
forest economics consultant from Portland, Ore. He said the
question is, "How much of this is really necessary and how
will it be implemented over time?"
   The Forest Service has estimated that 8,000 timber jobs
would be lost by the end of the decade under owl-protection
policies recommended in an April report by government
scientists.
   Mr. Beuter said his research shows the figure would be
twice that, plus thousands more jobs lost outside the timber
industry. The direct and indirect job loss would come to
102,000 by the end of the decade if the report's strategy is
applied to public and private lands, he said.
   A federal timber task force is scheduled to come up with
an extensive owl-protection plan by Sept. 1.
   Estimates of the remaining spotted owl population range
from 3,000 to 5,000 pairs. Each nesting pair needs a large
tract of undisturbed old-growth forest, biologists say.

   Flight International Group Inc. said three shareholder
lawsuits against the company, officers and directors, and its
accounting firm were settled for cash, stock, and notes
valued at $5.25 million.
   Flight International, based in Newport News, Va., is an
aviation-services company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the settlement, Flight International will issue
340,000 new shares of common stock to shareholders who
purchased company stock between June 21, 1988, and Sept. 29,
1989. Flight International has about 3.7 million shares
outstanding.
   The class-action suits alleged that the company filed
inaccurate financial statements for fiscal 1988 and fiscal
1989. In March, the company restated its fiscal 1989 earnings
to a loss of $3.8 million, or $1.29 a share, from previously
reported net income of $3.0 million, or $1.01 a share.
   Flight International valued its portion of the settlement
at about $1 million, based on an assumed stock value of about
$3 a share. The company's stock was delisted by NASDAQ
several months ago and does not actively trade.
   The remaining defendants contributed the rest of the
settlement, the company said. Those defendants include
Douglas G. Matthews, the company's former chairman; John W.
Orange Jr., former chief financial officer; and Deloitte &amp;
Touche, the company's independent accounting firm during the
alleged misstatements.

   Let's see if we understand the dynamics of a
stock-transfer tax, which it's rumored President Bush might
support. On the one hand, he says he's still pushing for a
cut in the capital-gains rate. On the other hand, there's now
talk of up to a 0.5% tax on transfers of stocks, bonds and
futures. This would obviously burden the growth effects of a
cut in the gains rate. We are tempted to dismiss this
proposal as patently absurd, except that with lip reading out
of style we can take nothing for granted.
   Loose lips sink shares. For starters, how about a fall in
share prices of between 9.3% and 14.6% and a drop in volume
of 12.7%? These are some of the unhappy estimates of the
impact of a 0.5% transfer tax made by the Congressional
Research Service. The group studied the issue in March 1987,
the last time anyone -- then-Speaker Jim Wright -- floated
this possible tax.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A transfer tax would be the worst kind of betrayal of tax
reform. By its very nature, this tax would discourage
economically sensible deals. Every possible trade would be
affected by the tax, which would raise the cost of capital by
making it more expensive to move capital from one investment
to another.
   "The higher transaction costs and lower trading volume
would reduce the efficiency of the stock market in the sense
that some transactions which are justified on the basis of
the underlying economics would no longer occur," the
congressional report said. "The tax would make the cost of
some investments prohibitive. For other investments it would
create a `lock-in' effect; selling an existing investment and
buying another might increase the expected return, but the
transaction costs associated with the trade would exceed the
potential gain."
   It is passing strange that the proposal should waft out of
the Treasury, where Secretary Nicholas Brady has complained
about volatility in the markets. The congressional report,
which came before the 1987 crash, noted that "reduced trading
volume would also decrease the liquidity of the stock market
somewhat and could possibly increase volatility, since larger
price changes may be required to match demand and supply in a
market with less volume."
   The effects could be even more dramatic in the futures
markets. The Chicago Board of Trade estimates a soybean
futures contract for $65,000 worth of soybeans that now costs
about $75 to transact would cost about $400. A 0.5% tax on
this contract explains the $325 difference. Farmers should
ask why the federal government would want them to choose
between paying extortionate amounts in transaction taxes or
forgetting about hedging their risks.
   Even the estimated revenues of between $8 billion and $10
billion a year are highly suspect products of 1970s-style
static analysis. If fewer trades are done, less revenue will
come in.
   International competition would guarantee fewer
U.S.-taxable trades. Any effort to tax Americans on foreign
exchanges is doomed to fail. Modems, faxes and satellites
make markets highly portable. Many trades will migrate to
lowest-cost markets. Several countries have no taxes on
securities transactions. Indeed, the major countries that do
have transfer taxes, including Japan, Britain and Canada, are
moving to abolish or lower them. Even the socialist mayor of
Frankfurt, accompanied by a representative of his Green Party
government coalition, not long ago told a group of Journal
editors that they hoped Bonn would abolish the German
stock-transfer tax so that Frankfurt could compete with the
City of London.
   Since there is no economic justification for this tax, and
with the administration seemingly content to let these
proposals wander around in public, we're left to speculate
that they must lie in someone's political constellation. Dick
Darman may figure this would be good soak-the-rich politics,
perhaps to ease a capital-gains cut. Or maybe Secretary Brady
figures he can punish his pet peeve of short-term investing
by making it more expensive to trade as often as the market
demands. The weak distinction between long- and short-term
investing aside, someone should remind the White House that
pension plans and mutual funds do much of the risk-hedging
and other high-volume trading. Union officials worried about
returns on pensions are already lobbying against this tax.
   As we say, it's hard to treat this as a serious proposal.
Maybe the White House is tossing up trial tax balloons to see
them shot down. This kind of political game, though, works
best only when there is clear, reliable leadership that will
just say no to bad ideas.
   It is now clear that the price President Bush's opponents,
and perhaps even some friends, will make him pay for dropping
his no-tax pledge will come in the dear coin of credibility.
No one can know which of today's wacko tax proposals will
become tomorrow's tax policies. There is a caldron brewing of
great uncertainty and risk. The last time a national leader
lost control of economic policy we suffered a malaise not
suffered in this country for more than a decade.

   ST. LOUIS -- Interco Inc. reported a net loss of $41.3
million for its fiscal first quarter, but the widening
deficit isn't likely to affect the company's talks with
bondholders about restructuring almost $900 million in debt.
   Interco is a furniture and shoe maker that borrowed
heavily in 1988 to fend off a hostile takeover.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rothschild Inc., financial adviser to bondholders who have
been grumbling about Interco's debt restructuring plan since
it was announced in May, presented a counterproposal last
week in separate meetings with the company, its bankers and
its medium-term note holders. Details of the bondholders'
plan couldn't be learned. But holders have said they don't
like the company's plan because it relies heavily on issuing
new common stock, instead of interest-paying bonds. They also
have suggested that the company's bank lenders should make
more concessions.
   Wilbur Ross, a Rothschild senior managing director, said
only that the counterproposal is "more favorable" to
bondholders. "The real issue is what's a fair distribution of
values here and that's what we tried to address in the
counterproposal," he said.
   Mr. Ross added that the first-quarter loss was in line
with expectations and wouldn't affect the discussions. He
said the bondholders expect to receive a response in the next
few days.
   Interco said only that the talks with bondholders "have
been constructive."
   For the quarter ended May 31, Interco's net loss widened
to $41.3 million, or $1.64 a share, from $31.6 million, or
$1.29 a share. The company said its Converse and Florsheim
shoe operations earned more than a year ago, but its
furniture business was soft.
   Lower interest expenses, however, helped narrow the loss
from continuing operations to $34.1 million, or $1.46 a
share, from $41.4 million, or $1.54 a share, a year earlier.
   Sales from continuing operations declined 24% to $357.9
million from $468.7 million.
   Nevertheless, Richard B. Loynd, Interco's chairman,
predicted that full-year earnings for the company's four core
units -- Converse and Florsheim shoes and Broyhill and Lane
furniture -- will exceed last year's results.

   In an effort to stem erosion of its market share in laser
printers, Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif., unveiled a
new low-priced line of printers for its Macintosh computer.
   Apple's new low-end machine, the Personal LaserWriter SC,
is slower than older models but is priced at $1,999, 29% less
than Apple's previous lowest-priced model. Apple's new line
also includes the full-featured NT model, which lists for
$3,299, compared with $4,599 for Apple's previous
full-featured model.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The SC machine is designed to plug into a single
Macintosh, while the NT model can be connected to several
machines, including non-Apple computers, at once. Both
machines print about four pages a minute, compared with eight
pages per minute on the older machines.
   Apple has been losing market share in the laser-printer
business to Hewlett-Packard Co., which has targeted Apple's
customers by undercutting Apple's printer prices. Apple
figures that its lower prices will attract new users who
don't need to print in high volumes.

   International:
   Gorbachev Wins Backing
   To Redesign the Politburo

   Expansion in Membership
   Of Party Executive Body
   Could Boost Reformers

   MOSCOW -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev won a battle
over membership of the Politburo, advancing his campaign to
maintain control of the Communist Party while redesigning the
leadership.
   The Politburo now must include the general secretary, his
deputy, and the first secretaries of the Communist Parties of
each of the 15 republics. This lineup will bring more
reform-minded members onto the crucial policy-making body
while adding to the growing powers of the restive republics.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new membership rules erode the traditional domination
of the Politburo by Russian hard-liners. Many of the
potential new members -- the regional first secretaries --
have a strong interest in fighting the power of the central
party in favor of their own region's independence. Many also
were put in place by Mr. Gorbachev over the past two years,
and therefore owe him allegiance.
   However, one of the most powerful members of the new
Politburo will be a rising opponent of Mr. Gorbachev, Ivan
Polozkov, newly elected head of the Russian Communist Party.
Mr. Polozkov has been ambivalent about Mr. Gorbachev's
reforms.
   "We are recognizing reality by strengthening the weight of
republican parties," said Mr. Gorbachev. "We are giving our
comrades working in the republics influence in the highest
leadership."
   The new Politburo will also include some additional
members from the broader leadership body, the Central
Committee, which in turn would be elected by the party
congress. Mr. Gorbachev hinted that the size of the Politburo
might be expanded to 21 to 23 members. The present Politburo
has 12 voting members.
   The plan passed overwhelmingly in the general vote, but
not until five hours had been spent debating its various
elements. The plan essentially revived an idea of Mr.
Gorbachev's that first won Central Committee approval in
February. Since then, however, the proposal has met
increasing resistance. Just last week, it seemed to be
derailed after a meeting of heads of party delegations --
largely conservative -- rejected the idea of an expanded
Politburo.
   Conservatives feared the idea because it would sap their
strength in the party. Radicals were concerned that any
deputy positions might be held by conservatives who could
overpower a more moderate general secretary.
   But delegates yesterday said that the general secretary
would probably propose several candidates of his own for the
deputy position. And most delegates say that Mr. Gorbachev is
almost sure to win any race for the top post.
   The victory was a sample of Mr. Gorbachev's skillful
handling of the congress so far.
   First, he took over the chairmanship of the rules
commission from Georgy Razumovsky, who had drafted an opening
set of new rules that were relatively hard-line. Today, Mr.
Gorbachev abruptly left the hall 20 minutes into the morning
session to return only minutes before the afternoon lunch
break, smiling broadly.
   After the lunch break, Mr. Gorbachev explained that the
commission had yet to finish its full rules proposals, but
urged that the leadership question be settled first.
   From the start of the congress, the question of the
Politburo structure was seen as key in the battle between
conservatives and reformers for control of the party.
Conservatives had wanted to maintain the status quo while
reformers wanted to broaden the Politburo, change its name to
"presidium" and call its chief "chairman" instead of "general
secretary." Yesterday's decision was a classic Gorbachev
compromise in which his opponents won on the language, but
reformers won on content.
   Not all delegates were admiring of Mr. Gorbachev's
tactics. "If the whole congress votes for one chairman, he'll
stand to rule the whole Central Committee, like a king," said
Alexander Buzgalin, a leader of the Marxist Platform, a
subgroup within the party that wants certain democratic
reforms but believes in collective leadership. "In Mr.
Gorbachev we see some very clever stifling of delegates."
   Some delegates insisted that the Politburo should include
representatives from each republic, but that candidates for
those posts should be elected separately, rather than
automatically being filled by party first secretaries. Others
feel that if republics are to be represented, then different
sectors of society such as workers and peasants should also
have their own representation in the leadership. These issues
are likely to prolong debate over the draft rules, said
Alexei Ilin, head of the congress secretariat.
   All the wrangling has delayed the party agenda to such an
extent that few delegates expect the congress to conclude on
Thursday, as originally planned. "The congress is an
organism, not a machine," said delegate Nikolai Sakirko.
"There are almost 5,000 delegates and we keep encountering
different problems as we move on."

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Ayer is Considering Going Public
   As It Pays Heed to Financial Side

   Ayer, one of the ad industry's oldest names and one of
just a handful of huge agencies to remain privately held, is
considering going public, its new chief financial officer
said.
   In an interview, Glenn Corlett said that financial
pressures on the beleaguered agency, which is still reeling
from two major client losses, are prompting him to explore a
number of alternatives, including going public.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That admission is startling, considering that Ayer has
repeatedly stressed its determination to remain independent
and private. It also augurs a new direction for Ayer, which,
perhaps for the first time, is taking its finances as
seriously as it takes its ads.
   Mr. Corlett said the likelihood of such a drastic step is
probably less than 50%, but that he nevertheless must give it
some consideration. "Taking this agency public is certainly
one thing we need to look at from time to time. We've
historically said we want to remain independent. . . . But
the fact of the matter is, in this changing world, you have
to re-evaluate that preference regularly. I'm looking at
that." He added that "the mandate I've been given is,
`nothing is out of bounds.'"
   Mr. Corlett said he would also consider other options,
such as selling a minority stake in Ayer to a foreign firm,
or a setup similar to the one between Foote, Cone &amp; Belding
and France's Publicis, in which each holds a minority stake
in the other. He said selling all or a majority of Ayer to
another company isn't under consideration. Any of those
alternatives would be a radical departure for Ayer, founded
121 years ago and known for its emotional ads for blue-chip
clients like American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, General Motors
and Procter &amp; Gamble.
   The fact that Mr. Corlett is even considering steps that
management had until recently ruled out categorically points
up just how distressed the advertising industry has become.
Ayer in particular has had a few rough years. Since 1988,
U.S. billings have plunged 23%, to an estimated $726 million
from $947 million, mostly because of the loss of two huge
accounts: Burger King in 1989 and Continental Airlines
earlier this year. The agency recently closed its Houston
office and last year had to merge its Chicago office with a
local agency there after the Chicago outpost lost almost all
its clients.
   Mr. Corlett, who became chief financial officer last
month, spoke candidly in the interview about Ayer's financial
situation. In the past year, he said, revenue slid 25%,
mostly because of the loss of the two clients. At the same
time, New York-based Ayer hasn't cut costs enough to counter
the revenue loss. U.S. payroll costs, for example, have
declined only 17% since 1988, to an estimated $59 million
this year. The upshot: While the agency remains profitable,
its profitability fell last year and will remain about flat
this year, he said.
   Layoffs might seem a reasonable step to improve
profitability. But Ayer, which prides itself on its
paternalistic tradition of avoiding layoffs, is determined to
preserve that culture. Considering layoffs "was clearly
discouraged" by top management, Mr. Corlett said. He said he
is hoping to cut costs by attrition, doing away with some
duplicated functions and more fully computerizing the
company.
   Meanwhile, Ayer, like other large privately held agencies,
must wrestle with how to expand and compete with agencies
that have access to funds from the public. The mega-agencies
that grew and merged throughout the 1980s relied on raising
money through the public markets. Private agencies had to use
their own money and bank loans to keep up. Now, with ad
spending in a stubborn lull and with the economy awash in
uncertainty, the private agencies are finding expansion
difficult.
   Ayer, for one, used to make acquisitions with internally
generated cash. But in the past two years, it had to borrow
about $25 million to make several dozen European acquisitions
with a total price tag of over $50 million, Mr. Corlett said.
Part of his mandate is to find "economical ways to service
that debt," he said, while part is to find new ways to
continue growing.
   "You can raise money from the public markets if you're
public. But if you aren't, you've got a real problem with
financing that rapid growth," he said. "We are struggling
under the issues of how do we finance our growth and control
the related costs." He said one possible answer will be to
create joint ventures abroad, rather than to buy existing ad
agencies outright. The agency has 71 offices in 41 countries
and owns either the majority or 100% of most of its agencies
abroad.
   Emphasizing that Ayer has ruled out selling all or a
majority of the agency to an outsider, Mr. Corlett said that
to remain independent, the agency "is willing to accept
tightening our belt and a little less profit."
   Mr. Corlett's appointment is a sign that even the most
traditional Madison Avenue holdouts are taking finances more
seriously. A Price Waterhouse veteran, Mr. Corlett is the
first Ayer chief financial officer to come from the "outside"
and the first who didn't start his career in advertising. His
predecessor at Ayer, for instance, began as an account
executive.
   Mr. Corlett also is the first chief financial officer in
the agency's history to be named to the board. The fact that
his predecessors weren't "gives you a hint of what the
advertising people thought of that function -- they didn't
hold it in high regard," he said.
   "The financial function is coming out of the closet, and
it's becoming a lot more important in terms of whether the
agencies can remain competitive," he said. "Today, in order
to survive and compete, you'd better have effective financial
management. It probably hasn't been true before, but in the
1990s, it certainly is going to be true. You'll see a lot of
ad agencies go out of business because they don't pay
attention to the financial side."

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   More Americans Are Called for Jury Duty
   ----

   Jury duty is becoming a fact of life for a rapidly growing
percentage of Americans, according to a new national survey.
   Forty-five percent of adults in the U.S. have been called
at least once for jury duty, up from 35% in 1984, according
to the study by the consulting firm of Research &amp; Forecasts,
Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Jury scholars link the increase to innovations in court
administration, including better methods of identifying and
finding potential jurors and greater efforts to limit the
length of most jurors' service.
   The survey's sponsor, a group of corporate defense lawyers
called the Defense Research Institute, also suggests that the
expanded need for jurors may be a byproduct of increased
litigiousness in the society. Archie Robinson, president of
DRI, says more cases are being filed and prepared for trial
than in the past. In addition, he says, a higher percentage
are high-stakes cases that often take a long time to try. In
such cases, he says, it's customary to call a larger pool of
potential jurors, since many will be unable to serve in a
long case and will have to be disqualified.
   But jury researchers dispute Mr. Robinson's conclusion.
Marc Galanter, a litigation expert at the University of
Wisconsin law school, says available data in several large
states indicates that the number of civil jury trials did not
increase between 1984 and 1988. In federal court, there were
5,555 civil jury trials in 1984 and 5,676 in 1989, he said.
   Any increased need for jurors, Mr. Galanter says, is
probably the result of "a lot more of an intent to use jurors
efficiently." He adds, "In a lot of places they instituted a
one trial, one day system, so they call more people and don't
keep them sitting as long."
   Under such a system, a person is called for a single day,
and if he is not assigned to a trial that day he is not
required to return. If the person is selected for a longer
trial, he must serve for the duration of that trial. The one
day, one trial system is now used in jurisdictions that
embrace about 25% of the U.S. population, according to an
estimate by Thomas Munsterman, director of the Center for
Jury Studies of the National Center for State Courts.
   Mr. Munsterman says that another reason more people are
being called for jury duty is that many courts are expanding
their methods of finding potential jurors. While most
jurisdictions used to rely primarily on voter-registration
lists, in recent years many have added back-up lists,
including driving records. Drivers' lists generally include
90%-95% of adults, while only about 70% of adults are
registered to vote in most areas, Mr. Munsterman says.
   In other findings, the Defense Research Institute survey
determined that people with incomes over $40,000 a year are
much more likely to be called for jury duty than those with
incomes income of less than $40,000. In addition, men are
slightly more likely to be called than women.
   The survey also found that most people who are called on
to serve only sit and wait; with most potential jurors
disqualified for one reason or another before trial, only 17%
of adult Americans get to serve on a jury in an actual trial.

   WOMEN HARD HATS win an unusual settlement with
construction company.
   Tishman Construction Corp. was sued for alleged sex
discrimination in 1988 by several female construction workers
and by a group that trains women for blue-collar jobs. To
settle the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Tishman
recently agreed to begin hiring women for one out of every
three available laborer jobs.
   Tishman, a construction-site manager, said that under the
settlement its goal will be for women to make up 10% of its
laborer work force. Currently, about 5% of Tishman's 197
laborers are women. According to Nontraditional Employment
for Women, or NEW, the group that helped bring the lawsuit,
women hold only 3% of all laborer jobs on construction site
in New York City.
   NEW said it has a waiting list of 80 women looking for
construction jobs. A spokeswoman said the group hopes the 10%
goal will be reached within six months, although the
settlement doesn't provide a deadline for reaching that
level. The settlement is in effect for three years.
   Henry Estrada, a Tishman vice president, said in a
statement: "While Tishman doesn't believe there has been
discrimination on its part in hiring women for laborer jobs,
we are pleased to join with NEW in additional efforts that
will result in more women entering the construction industry
labor force."
   NEW said it isn't seeking special treatment for women but
wants to ensure that female job applicants are evaluated
fairly.

   FORMER WEST VIRGINIA governor fails in motion to withdraw
guilty plea.
   U.S. District Judge Walter E. Hoffman denied former Gov.
Arch A. Moore Jr.'s request to withdraw his guilty plea on
five felonies related to a scheme to extort money and to buy
votes. Sentencing is set for today.
   In April, a Charleston grand jury accused Mr. Moore, a
three-time Republican governor of the predominantly
Democratic state of illegal activities while campaigning and
serving as governor.
   Attorneys for the former governor maintained that his
guilty plea was "the result of a hasty decision forced by a
deadline imposed by the government."

   McMARTIN child-abuse case goes to jury in retrial.
   After hearing two months of testimony, jurors in Los
Angeles Superior Court yesterday began their task of deciding
whether Raymond Buckey is guilty of eight counts of child
molestation. The charges involve three girls who were once
pupils at the now-defunct Virginia McMartin Preschool in
Manhattan Beach, Calif., where Mr. Buckey was a teacher.
   In January, after almost three months of deliberations and
28 months of testimony, another jury acquitted Mr. Buckey and
his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey on 52 of 65 counts of child
molestation. The jury was deadlocked on the remaining 13
counts. The prosecution later decided to retry Mr. Buckey on
eight of the unresolved counts.
   Throughout both trials, Mr. Buckey, who was indicted in
March 1984 and has already served over four years in prison,
has proclaimed his innocence.

   MULHEREN DELIBERATIONS CONTINUE: A federal court jury
began its second week of deliberations in the trial of John
A. Mulheren Jr. The jury is considering whether Mr. Mulheren,
the former chief of Jamie Securities Co., is guilty of
conspiracy, securities and mail fraud and keeping false
records. The government has alleged that Mr. Mulheren
conducted numerous illegal securities trades with Ivan F.
Boesky, the convicted former stock speculator. Leonard
DeStefano, a former assistant to Mr. Mulheren, was also
charged in the 30-count indictment. Jurors have asked
numerous times over the last week to have testimony from the
seven-week trial read to them and for definitions of various
trading terms. Deliberations are set to resume today.

   WIC Agrees to Buy
   Media Properties
   In Western Canada

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Fast-growing WIC Western
International Communications Ltd. said it agreed to acquire
the media holdings of Alberta entrepreneur Dr. Charles Allard
in a cash and stock transaction valued at about 157.4 million
Canadian dollars (US$135.5 million).
   The proposed purchase would add two Alberta television
stations, as well as western Canada's Superchannel
pay-television service, and various production assets to
WIC's existing stable of radio, television, and satellite
communications operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It is a major acquisition. It would make WIC one of the
largest, if not the largest, private broadcasting concern in
Canada," said Barry Gruman, a Montreal-based communications
analyst with First Marathon Securities Ltd.
   The purchase, which requires regulatory approval, would
also bolster WIC's position as western Canada's dominant
broadcaster, which it secured last year with its C$200
million purchase of broadcasting assets from Toronto's
Maclean Hunter Ltd.
   WIC agreed to acquire Edmonton, Alberta, television
station CITV, and Red Deer, Alberta, television station CKRD,
for C$90.8 million, as well as various related production and
other assets for C$19.1 million.
   WIC also agreed to acquire, for about 3.7 million new WIC
Class B nonvoting common shares, all of the shares of
Superchannel's parent, closely held Allarcom Pay Television
Ltd., that WIC didn't previously own. Under prior agreements,
WIC had acquired 21% of Allarcom's common shares.
   Mr. Allard, an Edmonton financier who built his
communications holdings after successes in real estate, holds
with his family a controlling stake in Superchannel and the
Alberta television stations.
   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, WIC's Class B
shares closed at C$13, up 12.5 Canadian cents, giving the
stock component of the transaction an indicated value of
C$47.5 million. Mr. Allard will hold an equity stake of about
22% in WIC once the transaction closes, a WIC executive said.
Mr. Allard and his son will also become WIC directors.
   The transaction, which isn't expected to close until at
least the end of the year, would reunite WIC's
expansion-minded president and chief executive, Douglas
Holtby, with his former boss, Mr. Allard. Mr. Holtby joined
WIC about a year ago after serving as president of Mr.
Allard's broadcast operations.
   During his tenure at Allarcom, Mr. Holtby helped it score
some successes on the production side, most notably with
SCTV, a comedy program produced by Edmonton station CITV that
was subsequently picked up in the U.S. by the NBC network.

   EPA Sets Toxic-Waste Cleanup Rules;
   Heavy Costs Likely for Chemical Firms

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The federal government proposed
hazardous-waste cleanup standards that would impose heavy
costs on chemical and other companies but generally spur
brisk growth among treatment and disposal companies.
   The standards, proposed by the Environmental Protection
Agency, spell out procedures for decontaminating waste
generated routinely during manufacturing or resulting from
accidents or spills. The agency put the cost to private
industry at between $7 billion and $42 billion over 20 years,
with the biggest impact falling on chemical companies,
petroleum refiners, wood preservers, metal finishers and auto
manufacturers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new rules, called "corrective action" rules, would
affect 3,000 to 4,000 operating facilities, including several
hundred owned by the federal government. They would result in
a cleanup effort bigger than the federal Superfund program,
which is designed to clean up abandoned waste sites.
Currently, the agency has no comprehensive standards for
cleaning up hazardous wastes at sites that haven't been
abandoned.
   Much of the cleanup business resulting from the proposed
rules probably would go to companies such as Chemical Waste
Management, International Technology Corp. and Canonie
Environmental Services Corp., according to Debra Coy,
environmental analyst at Washington Analysis Corp., a
research arm of County NatWest Securities. "My sense is there
is some pent-up demand out there that should be released,"
she said.
   EPA officials and private analysts predicted that the
rules, along with other federal actions tightening cleanup
and permit requirements over the past few years, would force
marginally profitable polluters and cleanup companies out of
business. The EPA said industries that may have a rough time
complying include the sanitation services, coatings and
engravings and wood products industries.
   The new standards would address treatment, storage or
disposal of hazardous wastes by any company that has such
wastes on hand for 90 days or more. Don Clay, an assistant
EPA administrator, said a growing number of companies would
be covered because more and more substances are considered
toxic.
   The cost of cleaning federal sites, which mostly are owned
by the Energy and Defense departments, would range from $3
billion to $18 billlion.
   The rules aren't likely to become final for a couple of
years, largely because the White House Budget Office, which
held up the rules for two years, is requiring the agency to
develop more precise estimates of the projected costs. The
environmental agency also plans to hold hearings and consider
public comments on the proposal.
   But release of the proposal is expected to get work
started at a variety of facilities where companies have been
waiting to get a sense of what form the regulations would
take.
   The EPA, under its existing authority, has imposed cleanup
requirements at more than 600 facilities. Mr. Clay said the
proposal aims to standardize rules and procedures while
expediting cleanups. In some cases, requirements are designed
to deal with existing environmental hazards; in other cases
they are meant to prevent potential future threats, he said.

   Tapie Seeks Thrill of Victory With Adidas

   PARIS -- Bernard Tapie, who has agreed to buy 80% of the
West German sporting goods empire Adidas AG, is one of the
most aggressive, controversial and politically ambitious
financiers in France.
   A lover of big yachts, big deals and splashy publicity,
Mr. Tapie now needs his bankers' help. Bankers close to him
say that because the Adidas purchase was handled in secrecy,
Mr. Tapie hasn't yet been able to put together the financing.
Although the price hasn't been disclosed, analysts estimate
that it is well in excess of the Tapie empire's total assets,
perhaps as much as three times the value of his main company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Tapie, one friend said, was sailing yesterday on a
90-foot yacht off the Spanish Mediterranean island of Ibiza.
Before he left World Cup soccer festivities in Rome, however,
the self-made son of a Paris working class family summed up
the purchase with typical gusto:
   "For the first time, I have the probably unique chance to
realize my three biggest passions with one project: sports,
business and politics."
   West Germans reacted with shock. Adidas employees said
they fear Mr. Tapie will do away with high-cost German jobs.
And the German establishment mourned the loss of a national
institution.
   For the 47-year-old Mr. Tapie, the purchase would be the
latest in a series of high-profile victories. Mr. Tapie was
elected to parliament in 1988. Through repeated television
appearances, some as the host of a show seeking funds for
aspiring entrepreneurs, Mr. Tapie has become a symbol of
individual success.
   "Tapie was the first to tell people, especially young
people, that he actively sought profit, that profit is good,"
said Pierre Despessailles, managing director of a Credit
Lyonnais affiliate called Societe de Banque Occidentale who
was one of the first bankers to back Mr. Tapie. "He has told
them, `I have made money, I live well, I manage to build
companies, and you can do the same.'"
   French unions castigate Mr. Tapie as a profit-hungry
speculator who lays off workers, but he is received at the
presidential palace by Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand.
   Mr. Tapie is an ardent opponent of far-right leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen. After he was widely judged the victor in a
television debate with Mr. Le Pen, French politicians began
whispering that he had begun aiming at high political office.
Asked by an interviewer recently whether he might like to
become prime minister, Mr. Tapie angrily rejected the notion,
but then added, "I never exclude anything."
   Mr. Tapie told reporters in Rome that in his quest for
Adidas he had won over the four Dassler sisters, daughters of
Adidas founder Adi Dassler, one by one, in a secret
nine-month campaign. The sisters agreed to sell last
Wednesday. Adidas officials said Mr. Tapie now is talking to
the two children of their late brother, who control the
remaining 20%.
   He will get one of the world's largest sporting goods
companies and much more. Selling its clothing, shoes and
equipment in 160 countries, Adidas has a brand recognition
almost as high as Mercedes-Benz. Some 80% of the participants
in the 1988 Olympic games were equipped by Adidas, as were 15
of the 24 teams in this year's soccer World Cup.
   Sources close to Mr. Tapie say he now will be aiming for
one of the Dasslers' most influential holdings, which he
won't get as part of the Adidas purchase. That is their 51%
of ISL Marketing AG of Luzern, Switzerland. ISL, which is
49%-controlled by Japan's Dentsu advertising group, arranges
sponsors and financing for the Olympics and other
international sports events.
   That, together with Adidas's dominance as a team
outfitter, gave former Chairman Horst Dassler huge influence,
extending to the choice of sites for games.
   Mr. Dassler's 1987 death from cancer at the age of 51 is
widely viewed as a source of the company's current problems.
Adidas last year reportedly posted a 120 million mark loss
($72.6 million) on 4.6 billion marks in sales, although
management has projected a return to profitability this year.
   The Adidas clout isn't lost on Mr. Tapie, who told
reporters that he hopes to use Adidas's political power to
ensure that France is chosen as the site for the 1998 World
Cup.
   To win over the Dassler sisters, Mr. Tapie said, he
promised that he would end his old ways of firing managers,
improving financial performance and then reselling companies
for a quick gain. And he promised to continue the company
policy of creating and supporting sports training centers,
providing low-cost equipment to teams in the developing world
and sponsoring sports activities.
   Mr. Tapie told the French newspaper Liberation that
promises of this kind helped him get a special price and that
he couldn't have afforded to outbid Japanese competitors in
an open auction.
   "For them {the Dasslers}, it was out of the question that
a Japanese take control because they think in terms of
European culture and refuse to be eaten up by the two big
powers {the U.S. and Japan}," he told Liberation.
   In a message sent to Adidas staff yesterday, he said the
current chairman, Rene Jaeggi, will remain in place.
   Mr. Tapie's bankers said that despite any promises,
further layoffs are likely. Over the past four years, the
company has trimmed 5,000 jobs, and employs 9,500 currently.
Only 2,500 of those jobs are in high-cost West Germany.
Moreover, to help save money, Adidas produces only 14% of its
products itself. The rest are made under license in 19
countries outside West Germany.

   Patent-Infringement Claims
   Ask Royalties for Use
   Of Encasing Procedure

   DALLAS -- Texas Instruments Inc. filed patent-infringement
lawsuits against five U.S. semiconductor manufacturers,
claiming it is owed royalties on a basic chipmaking process.
   The suits, filed in federal court here, allege that five
small specialty manufacturers are importing and selling chips
that infringe a patent issued to Texas Instruments in 1977
covering a process to encase integrated circuits in plastic.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The defendant firms are Analog Devices Inc., Norwood,
Mass.; Cypress Semiconductor Corp., San Jose, Calif.;
Integrated Device Technology Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.; LSI
Logic Corp., Milpitas, Calif., and VLSI Technology Inc., San
Jose.
   Texas Instruments, a semiconductor and defense concern,
said it also filed a complaint with the International Trade
Commission against the same manufacturers. Earlier, the
international trade tribunal upheld Texas Instruments's
complaint that Japanese and Korean chip companies had
infringed the same patent.
   Richard J. Agnich, a senior vice president of Texas
Instruments, said the company is taking the actions "to
prevent the unauthorized use of its technology and protect
the significant investments the company has made in
development of intellectual property that is used in
integrated circuits around the world."
   Industry analysts said the move was part of a strategy by
Texas Instruments to milk additional revenue out of
technology it has pioneered over the years. In 1987, the
company won landmark settlements against several competitors
from Japan and South Korea, forcing them to pay royalties
that have totaled $574 million to date.
   "TI is foraging through its storehouse finding all of
these patent claims," says Richard Whittington, an analyst
for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "It's a real plus for them."
   The revenue potential in this latest round of lawsuits is
unclear. While the packaging costs amount to only pennies per
chip, alternative packaging methods are much more costly.
"The question is how much can TI extract from the industry,"
said Michael Gumport, senior electronics analyst for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. "I don't think it is unreasonable to talk
about a penny a chip" on as many as 20 billion devices, the
analyst said. Texas Instruments declined to discuss its
royalty requests.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Texas
Instruments shares closed at $39.25, up 50 cents.
   Integrated Device Technology promised to fight the
lawsuit. "I'm certain we're going to challenge it," said Jack
Menache, vice president and general counsel. Other defendants
either declined to comment or couldn't be reached.

   LOS ANGELES -- Less than a week before the July 15
deadline set by Pic `N' Save Corp. to receive acquisition
bids for the company, a partnership controlled by investor
David H. Batchelder appeared to back away from earlier
indications that it would submit a bid.
   Girard Partners Limited Partnership said in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission that such an
acquisition would require additional equity beyond what its
partners have committed, as well as debt financing. Girard
said there can be no assurance that it will make an offer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Girard also said that it will renew its proxy solicitation
to gain control of Pic 'N' Save's board if the Dominguez,
Calif.-based discount retailer hasn't entered into an
agreement to sell itself by July 15. Pic 'N' Save and Girard
declared a truce last month while management conducts its
sale auction.
   In the filing, Girard said that if its nominees are
elected to Pic 'N' Save's board, they wouldn't expect to seek
an immediate sale of the company, but would attempt to
increase stockholder value through the management and
operation of the company as an ongoing business.
   Girard said it may decide to sell its stock and drop its
pursuit of Pic 'N' Save if its proxy fight fails. However,
Girard didn't rule out taking other steps, either alone or
with other shareholders, to obtain control of the company.
Girard holds a 6.7% stake in Pic 'N' Save, and Bill M.
Thomas, a Girard nominee, holds an additional 4%.
   A Pic 'N' Save spokesman declined to comment on the
filing. In La Jolla, Calif., Mr. Batchelder didn't return
telephone calls for elaboration on the partnership's
intentions.
   Pic 'N' Save shares closed yesterday at $11.75, off 25
cents.

   NEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a
civil lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan alleging that
Peter E. Butler, currently a securities analyst at First
Boston Corp., violated securities laws in recommending the
stock of Memory Metals Inc. in 1985 and 1986.
   Mr. Butler, a vice president at First Boston, a unit of CS
First Boston Inc., was a vice president in the research
department of PaineWebber Inc. until about January 1987. A
First Boston spokesman said the suit pertains to Mr. Butler's
actions while at PaineWebber and that First Boston isn't a
party to it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Warren Colodner, an attorney for Mr. Butler, said, "Mr.
Butler cooperated fully in the SEC investigation and he
believes he did nothing wrong." Mr. Colodner said the SEC
began its investigation in 1986.
   PaineWebber declined comment.
   In the lawsuit, the SEC seeks a court order barring Mr.
Butler from violating securities laws. It also asks the court
to order him to turn over all the profits from the alleged
wrongdoing involving the stock of Memory Metals, which later
changed its name to Memry Corp.
   The SEC said Memory Metals had only nominal sales and
sustained losses during the period of alleged wrongdoing. The
agency alleges that Mr. Butler misled investors and committed
fraud to encourage the sale of Memory Metals securities. The
SEC also alleged that Mr. Butler had bought Memory Metals
stock for his own account and was selling his shares while
recommending that others buy.
   The SEC said that Mr. Butler made predictions as to
specific price increases and other business developments
"without a reasonable basis and while knowing, or reckless
and not knowing, that such statements were materially false
or misleading."
   The SEC also said that Mr. Butler failed to disclose
information about the risk of investing in Memory Metals and
problems at the company.
   The First Boston spokesman said the firm has been aware of
the SEC investigation for several years. "Peter Butler is an
employee in good standing," the spokesman said. "We have
reviewed the allegations in depth with both Mr. Butler and
his outside counsel. Mr. Butler denies the allegations and we
support his decision to defend himself."

   Net investment in the stocks of one country's companies by
investors in another country soared to a record $92.3 billion
last year, nearly triple the previous high of $31.7 billion
set in 1986, a Salomon Brothers Inc. study found.
   The firm said that gross cross-border equity investment
climbed to a record $1.6 trillion last year -- or 14.5% of
world stock turnover -- from $1.2 trillion a year earlier.
British money managers led the way, followed by those from
the U.S. and Japan. Swiss portfolio managers ranked fourth.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These numbers mean that one stock transaction out of every
seven world-wide involves a foreign investor. Ten years ago,
that ratio was less than one in every 16, according to
Salomon.
   As of last year, the value of international shares held by
foreign investors stood at $830 billion, or 7.2% of the
aggregate value of world stock markets, up from $640 billion
in 1988.
   Still, Salomon said: "We believe the globalization of
equity markets has significantly further to go." The firm
estimated that the average investment portfolio contains less
than 10% of international assets, compared to what Salomon
contends should be an optimal level of 15%-20%.

   Eastern, Pilots Union Reach Impasse,
   Starting 30-Day Period to Strike or Settle

</IN>
<LP>
   Federal mediators overseeing contract talks between
Eastern Airlines and its pilots union declared an impasse,
setting off a 30-day countdown toward a strike or a
settlement.
   The union, the Air Line Pilots Association, immediately
said it would send strike ballots to its members.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's unlikely, however, that a strike would have anywhere
near the impact of last year's strike by machinists, which
was supported by pilots and flight attendants. That strike,
in March 1989, nearly grounded Eastern and tipped the
financially ailing carrier into bankruptcy court. Eastern
painstakingly built itself back to about 80% of its
pre-strike operations, and the pilots and flight attendants
ended their walkouts in November.
   The makeup of the pilot work force is starkly different
this time. The 1,900 pilots now flying for Eastern -- about
half of the pre-strike total -- are evenly split between
recently hired replacements and pilots who crossed the picket
line. Neither group has any reason to show special loyalty to
the pilots union. Only 89 pilots who went out on strike
before have been recalled. Union officials estimate that an
additional 1,403 are waiting to return. Under labor law,
however, the pilots union is still the bargaining agent for
all pilots working for Eastern.
   "The so-called strike vote they're talking about would be
polling pilots who aren't working," said an Eastern
spokeswoman. "It would be a non-event."
   The union's contract expired in mid-1988, but under
airline labor law, the old contract remains in effect until a
new one is negotiated or the National Mediation Board finds
the two sides are at an impasse. That happened when the board
proferred arbitration to the two sides, and the union
accepted while Eastern refused.
   The issues that brought this confrontation to a head are
an outgrowth of the previous strike's ultimate failure. Both
sides essentially agree on the financial aspects of a new
contract, and pilots say they are prepared to make
significant wage concessions because their main concerns
center on job guarantees. Pilot negotiators say Eastern
offered to provide only 510 jobs over the next three years
for formerly striking pilots. The pilots also want to
reattain their pre-strike seniority, but Eastern says it
won't downgrade the replacement pilots who saw the company
through the strike.
   In a statement, the pilots union also charged that Eastern
required that all pilot grievances, claims and lawsuits be
dropped before any contract could be signed. The union said
that included claims against Continental Airlines Holdings
Inc. which holds the equity in Eastern and, until April,
controlled the carrier. Continental Airlines Holdings is the
new name for Texas Air Corp.
   Eastern, which countered by saying the pilots demanded
that all litigation against the union be dropped, said those
issues are "totally extraneous."
   Complicating dealings between the two sides is Eastern's
status in bankruptcy court. Until spring, Eastern had been a
unit of Texas Air, but Eastern's creditors grew frustrated by
the constantly changing reorganization plans from Texas Air's
chairman, Frank Lorenzo. In April, at the creditors request,
the bankruptcy court removed Texas Air from day-to-day
management and appointed a trustee, Martin R. Shugrue. Mr.
Shugrue has consistently maintained that labor peace is one
of his goals, but so far he has had no luck in negotiating
with either the pilots or the still-striking machinists.
Pilots have charged that Mr. Shugrue's words are a "stalling
tactic."
   Furthermore, despite bankruptcy court protection, Eastern
continues to be unprofitable. The airline has said its
break-even load factor, the percentage of seats it needs to
fill, stands at 80%. But in May, load factor was 54%. June
traffic hasn't been disclosed yet.

   CyCare Systems Inc. said it will take about $21 million in
write-downs during the second quarter, reflecting the
discontinuation of certain product lines and other factors.
   In the year-earlier period, the supplier of
data-processing services for the health-care industry posted
net income of $791,000, or 14 cents a share, on revenue of
$22.4 million.
</LP>

   CyCare said the write-downs have been spurred by a change
in the company's strategic direction. The Phoenix, Ariz.,
company will now concentrate on supplying doctors in group
practice.
   "The adjustments due to this strategic redirection of the
corporation mark the end of an intensive review process, and
allows us to continue to move forward toward accomplishing
our goals of stable revenue and earnings growth," said Jim
Houtz, CyCare's chairman and chief executive officer.

   Post Office Plans
   To Hire Outsiders
   For Automation

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Over the protest of the American Postal
Workers Union, Postmaster General Anthony Frank will announce
today plans to hire contractors outside the Post Office to
encode a big chunk of the mail for automation.
   While the Postal Service refers to the plan as
"preliminary," Moe Biller, the union president, contended the
plan isn't preliminary, but final. He said the announcement
was sparked by a grievance the union filed against the idea
June 28.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Postal Service spokesman said there is no connection
between the grievance and the agency's announcement, however.
   Hardware for the remote bar coding system will be supplied
by the winning bidder among three potential suppliers, Postal
Service officials said at a news conference. The companies
are Bell &amp; Howell Co., Skokie, Ill.; TRW Inc., Cleveland; and
AEG Electrocom, Konstanz, West Germany. The service wouldn't
estimate how much the equipment might cost.
   Awards to furnish the equipment will probably be made near
the end of this year, the officials said. Plans are to
install 295 systems at 220 post offices by the end of 1995,
said Peter Jacobson, an assistant postmaster general. The
contractor will do the coding at another location, using an
electronic hookup to the post office. Bids to run the remote
coding operation will probably be solicited in September,
with contract awards in February or March, he said.
   Officials said the contracting out will save the Postal
Service $10 to $12 per work hour, or $4.3 billion over the 10
years the new equipment is expected to function. But Mr.
Frank has insisted that no regular postal worker will lose
his or her job because of the move to contract out the work;
instead, those who sort mail manually or on mechanical
equipment now will be retrained for other jobs, officials
said.
   To which Mr. Biller said, "They're not doing anybody a
favor." Those employees will become surplus, and costly to
retain, while outside contractors take over some of the work,
he argued.
   The Postal Service hopes remote encoding will help the
service fully automate mail processing by 1995. It will be
needed for about 20% of the letters going through the postal
system -- those that lack full, clear addresses that can be
read by the service's optical scanning machines.
   About 80% of the mail will have bar codes, representing
nine-digit address numbers, imprinted by mailing customers or
by bar-code machines at the post office, the Postal Service
hopes. Letters with the codes can be sorted rapidly by
machine.
   Under the new system, letters without customer-printed bar
codes or which optical character readers cannot read and
imprint with bar codes will be shunted aside. Images of the
envelopes will be transmitted to another site, where
operators will read them and put address data into a
computer, which will also provide coding information for the
letter.
   Using that data, machines back at the post office will
print the bar codes on the envelope. Pilot remote coding
operations are planned for post offices in Garden City, N.Y.,
by Bell &amp; Howell, and Louisville, Ky., by TRW, in the next
two months, officials said. The New York coding site is about
a mile from the Garden City post office, and the Louisville
location is about 10 miles away.

   Pitney Bowes Inc. said it expects to report a slight drop
in second-quarter net income from the year-earlier $61.8
million, or 78 cents a share.
   The Stamford, Conn., maker of postage meters, copiers,
voice-processing systems and other products said it will
report revenue growth of about 12% from $693.6 million a year
earlier.
</LP>

   "However, our net income is weaker than expected because
of continuing weak performance in our operations in Australia
and Germany; because of lower net income at Monarch Marking
Systems due to soft retail market conditions; and because of
higher-than-anticipated costs of reorganizing our copier
business," the company said.
   The company said it doesn't expect to meet analysts'
per-share earnings estimates of $3.50 to $3.70 for all of
1990. But the company said it does expect net income to
exceed the $252.8 million, or $3.19 a share, earned in 1989,
when revenue was $2.88 billion.

   Frenchman Settles
   Rorer Insider Case
   For $1.4 Million

   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
a French businessman agreed to pay $1.4 million to settle
insider-trading charges in connection with Rhone-Poulenc SA's
bid for Rorer Group Inc.
   The agency said Robert Rossi, who settled the charges
without admitting or denying guilt, purchased stock and
options in Rorer while in possession of material nonpublic
information that the Fort Washington, Pa., drug company was
to be the target of a bid by the state-owned French drug and
chemical concern. Mr. Rossi is an import and export trader
who lives in Africa, according to his attorney.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Rossi's lawyer, Daniel A. Pollack, said his client was
wrongly charged by the SEC but settled the charges to avoid
protracted litigation in the U.S. Mr. Rossi's "trading was
purely of his own analysis," Mr. Pollack said. "He knows no
one at Rorer, he knows no one at Rhone-Poulenc, he knows no
one in the French government."
   Mr. Rossi's settlement -- one of the SEC's largest against
a foreign investor -- contrasts with recent SEC efforts to
impose tough fines on alleged insider traders. Mr. Rossi's
$1.4 million payout consists totally of disgorgement of
alleged profit and a small amount of interest. SEC attorneys
wouldn't say why there was no fine in the case.
   The SEC said Mr. Rossi acknowledged that he bought Rorer
securities for his own account through Discount Bank Ltd. and
Cambio Valorenbank AG, two Swiss banks that were cited in the
agency's original complaint. Neither bank has been charged
with wrongdoing.
   The settlement is the first in the Rorer case. In January,
even before Rhone-Poulenc was revealed to be the bidder, the
SEC charged Mr. Rossi and four foreign companies with insider
trading that allegedly netted a total of nearly $6 million.
Rorer subsequently was acquired by Rhone-Poulenc for about
$3.23 billion.
   Another defendant, Holding Protection Ltd., of Greece, is
to go on trial later this month, according to SEC lawyers.
Two other defendants, Unifund SAL, of Lebanon, and Tamanaco
Saudi &amp; Gulf Investment Group, of Panama, are appealing
preliminary injunctions granted by a federal court in New
York. Charges have been dismissed against a fourth defendant,
Fondation Hai, of Monaco, the SEC lawyers said.
   The case is the second major insider-trading flap in
recent years to emerge from a French deal. The SEC last year
asked French legal authorities to investigate whether
investors friendly to President Francois Mitterrand and
France's Socialist Party conducted questionable trades while
Pechiney SA was negotiating to acquire American National Can
Co.

   GREENWICH, Conn. -- United Parcel Service of America Inc.,
the world's largest package-delivery company, agreed to buy
as much as 17.4% of fast-growing Mail Boxes Etc. Inc., San
Diego.
   A spokesman for closely held UPS said the company "derives
a substantial amount of business" from Mail Boxes Etc. and
similar companies. Mail Boxes Etc., targeting particularly
small businesses, operates a chain of franchised storefronts
offering services including post boxes, phone answering,
faxing, copying and funds transfer by wire.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In turn, Mail Boxes Etc. franchisees derive 40% to 50% of
their total revenue by acting as drop-off points for
customers who want UPS to deliver their packages, said A.W.
DeSio, Mail Boxes Etc.'s vice chairman and chief executive
officer. The franchisees also can take drop-offs for UPS
competitors.
   UPS agreed to pay $25.25 for each of 400,000 shares of
Mail Boxes Etc., a total $10.1 million. UPS also would buy
400,000 warrants, each exercisable into one Mail Boxes Etc.
share, for about $1.2 million, or $2.92 apiece. UPS can
exercise the warrants over three years at prices of $27 to
$38.88 a share; if it exercises the warrants it would hold
17.4% of Mail Boxes Etc.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Mail Boxes
Etc. shares jumped $3 to $25.
   The agreement, subject to UPS doing a due-diligence review
of Mail Boxes Etc.'s operations and a definitive agreement,
also allows UPS to boost its stake to as much as 35% after
one year. UPS would get a seat on Mail Boxes Etc.'s board,
which currently has seven members.
   The agreement will provide capital for Mail Boxes Etc.'s
growth; it has been adding about one new outlet a day for the
past year, Mr. DeSio said. The company has issued licenses to
franchise its name, trademarks and system in Canada and
Japan.
   "UPS has done nothing in {its} ground system and little in
the air system on their own to facilitate retail access to
their" services, said Paul Schlesinger of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp. The pact with Mail Boxes Etc. might
be "a means of exercising some influence" over a network of
drop-off centers for the infrequent, retail user of package
delivery.
   In March, Mail Boxes Etc. agreed to act as agent
exclusively for DHL Worldwide Express for domestic and
international overnight package delivery. That agreement,
which runs for a year, won't be affected.

   S.G. Warburg Names Nicholas Verey
   Head of U.S. Unit as Brooke Retires

   Britain's S.G. Warburg Group PLC named Nicholas Verey, an
international stocks and corporate-finance specialist,
chairman of its U.S. operations. He succeeds David Brooke,
who is retiring from the firm.
   The appointment, said executives at the British investment
and money-management firm, makes the 47-year-old Mr. Verey
one of five people who have a clear shot at succeeding Sir
David Scholey as chairman of the parent company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As head of the U.S. unit, Mr. Verey inherits the
leadership of what many consider one of the best
foreign-owned securities firms on Wall Street. And unlike
many of its American competitors, S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. is
hiring. "We can always do with a few more good people," said
Mr. Verey, who plans to strengthen the U.S. operation's
ability to market investment-banking services and its
international equity capabilities.
   Mr. Brooke's departure was unexpected, some employees
said. They said he has expressed a desire to join a smaller
firm, similar to Rowe &amp; Pittman Ltd., the brokerage firm he
had joined before it was bought by Warburg in 1986. Mr.
Brooke couldn't be reached for comment.
   Under his leadership, the U.S. unit grew to just under 300
people from about 250 a year ago. The firm also lured an
international leasing team away from Chase Manhattan Bank and
hired a group of private placement specialists from
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Two years ago, it became a
primary dealer, joining an elite group of 43 firms that trade
with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York when it buys and
sells U.S. government securities as part of its activities to
influence U.S. monetary policy.
   Mr. Verey said he plans to capitalize on what he believes
is a growing distaste for hostile acquisitions in the U.S.
and American investors' expanding appetite for foreign
securities. "There's going to be a great deal of money
flowing into Europe over the next 10 years, and one of the
biggest pools of available money is right here."
   That wasn't always the case. In 1974, Mr. Verey was a key
part of the firm's efforts to sell U.S. institutions on the
merits of investing in foreign stocks. With few exceptions,
he says: "The reaction was interesting and amusing, but they
didn't take us seriously."
   At the time, the capitalization of the U.S. stock market
was about 65% of the world's total. But now it's only 34%,
according to Morgan Stanley Capital International. Meanwhile,
U.S. institutions have discovered foreign stock markets in a
big way, especially with the planned 1992 abolition of trade
and investment barriers between the 12 countries of the
European Community and the opening of Eastern Europe.
   Warburg also has a growing mergers and acquisitions
capability -- it advised Ford Motor Co. on its $2.55 billion
acquisition of Jaguar PLC in November 1989 -- that Mr. Verey
believes he can capitalize on in light of what he said is the
changing attitude of Americans toward hostile takeovers.
   "There's going to be a barbarians' backlash," he said.
U.S. takeover style will become more like that in Britain,
where a takeover target and its institutional investors
discuss the company's long-range prospects, he predicted. And
if that does happen, Mr. Verey said Warburg should benefit.
"We are used to being involved in takeovers that are fought
over in discussion; some of the skills we have in the U.K.
and Europe will be applicable here," he said.
   Mr. Verey joined Rowe &amp; Pittman at age 18 after graduating
from Eton College, rising through the ranks at Rowe &amp; Pittman
until the firm was acquired by Warburg. In 1987 he became a
member of the parent company's board and most recently was in
charge of strategic planning, a responsibility he retains.
   Last spring, Mr. Verey spent three months at an executive
education program at Harvard University's Business School.
"David Scholey wouldn't let me loose in the U.S. without a
proper education," he said.

   Gets Contract
   For Saudi Tanks

   General Dynamics' Award,
   Valued at Over $3 Billion,
   Aids Endangered Plant

   General Dynamics Corp., desperate to keep open its Abrams
tank operation through overseas sales, got a big boost as the
U.S. government finalized a $3 billion-plus deal with Saudi
Arabia.
   The contract, which has long been expected, calls for
General Dynamics to supply a total of 315 next-generation M-1
tanks to the Saudis from 1993 through 1995. General Dynamics
will also supply support equipment, spare parts, training
facilities and munitions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Along with a 550-tank co-production agreement with Egypt,
negotiated last year, General Dynamics has moved a
significant step closer to guaranteeing that its assembly
plant in Lima, Ohio, stays open. Success there for the
company would mean, in turn, that its machining shop in
Warren, Mich., also would avoid being shut. General Dynamics,
the Pentagon's No. 2 supplier and the U.S.'s only tank
manufacturer, has said it needs to produce the M-1 at a rate
of at least 360 a year to ensure that one of its two tank
assembly lines can survive.
   General Dynamics has been producing 720 M-1s a year,
accounting for nearly 10% of the St. Louis-based company's
$10 billion in sales in 1989.
   As part of the Bush administration's 1991 budget, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney has called for ending purchases of M-1
tanks for the Army next year. But to cushion that blow and
give General Dynamics additional time to try to find other
customers, Mr. Cheney has stressed that the Pentagon's
proposal envisions filling the entire Saudi order.
   "We have no illusions about our tank business," a company
official said yesterday. "But even modest production would be
better than shutting things down entirely." General Dynamics
employs about 2,600 in Ohio and 1,200 in Michigan on the M-1
program.
   Robert Truxell, general manager of General Dynamics' Land
Systems Division, yesterday called the pact with the Saudis
"particularly important."
   "At a time of declining U.S. requirements, international
sales will play a key role in our efforts" to maintain M-1
sales in the 1990s, he said.
   Indeed, while the Saudi transaction still leaves General
Dynamics some 150 tanks short of its minimum annual
production goal -- not including any direct sales to the
Pentagon that may be restored on Capitol Hill -- the signing
of the accord could pave the way for other sales abroad. "We
could see a snowball effect," predicted Rep. Mike Oxley (R.,
Ohio).
   At present, General Dynamics is pitching the Abrams tank
to the United Arab Emirates, Sweden, Kuwait, Pakistan and
Canada. In addition, the British are expected to decide by
the end of the year if they want the M-1 to replace their
aging fleet of Chieftain tanks.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
General Dynamics shares closed up 87.5 cents at $33.

   Perjury Inquiries

   WASHINGTON -- The House panel investigating federal
housing corruption will ask a special prosecutor to
investigate possible acts of perjury by former housing
Secretary Samuel Pierce.
   The House employment and housing subcommittee will send a
letter of "at least 20 pages" to Arlin Adams, the special
prosecutor who was appointed this year to look into
irregularities in the Department of Housing and Urban
Development's moderate-rehabilitation rent-subsidy program.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The subcommittee will ask Mr. Adams, a retired federal
judge, to seek permission from the three-judge appellate
court panel that appointed him to expand his authority. The
subcommittee wants Mr. Adams to examine three additional
areas, the most serious of which is perjury, according to
Stuart Weisberg, the subcommittee's chief counsel.
   The letter to Mr. Adams, which Mr. Weisberg expects to be
delivered next week, will "cite the specific quotes, the
specific statements" in testimony of Mr. Pierce that the
House panel believes may be false.
   Mr. Pierce's lawyer, Paul Perito, said it is
"inconceivable" that Mr. Adams would find that the former
secretary lied. Mr. Perito added that the subcommittee's
effort is a "bold and unwarranted attempt to put the
secretary in unfavorable light with the independent counsel."
   Mr. Weisberg wouldn't give examples of possible Pierce
inconsistencies. But members of the House panel previously
have pointed to testimony from former HUD officials, who
contradicted the former secretary by indicating that Mr.
Pierce had direct involvement in awarding contracts through
political favoritism.
   In May, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh asked the special
prosecutor to expand his inquiry to include allegations of
favoritism in grants from the secretary's discretionary fund
and from an urban development program. Mr. Adams office
wouldn't say what decision, if any, has been made on the
Thornburgh request.
   Mr. Weisberg said the subcommittee won't accuse Mr. Pierce
of committing perjury, but will suggest there is reasonable
cause to believe that further investigation is warranted. "We
believe that standard has been more than met in these
instances," he said.
   He wouldn't disclose the other two areas the panel wants
the special prosecutor to examine, but Mr. Weisberg did add:
"Perjury is the one Pierce will have the most trouble with."

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mobil Oil Corp. agreed to pump out an
underground lake of fuel oil, gasoline and naphtha that
leaked beneath the streets from a creekside terminal during
the past half-century or more.
   The 14.5 million gallon pool of petroleum products lying
under a section of Brooklyn is larger than the almost 11
million gallons spilled by the tanker Exxon Valdez off Alaska
last year. That was the nation's largest one-time spill.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   State officials said it will take years and cost tens of
millions of dollars to remove the Brooklyn oil, which lies on
top of an aquifer. The aquifer is not used for drinking
water, and authorities also are unsure what health danger, if
any, may be posed by the underground oil.
   Authorities have known of the problem at least since 1950,
when gasoline fumes exploded in a sewer on Henry Street. In
1978 they estimated the size of the spill at 17 million
gallons. Of that, about 2.5 million gallons have been pumped
out in a cleanup program that began in 1981.
   The state has called that cleanup rate far too slow. The
work had been shared by Mobil and Amoco Corp. Under the new
agreement, Mobil alone is to clean up the spill; it may seek
on its own to recover costs from other oil companies that it
believes share responsibility.
   The oil and other petroleum products leaked from the
Greenpoint terminal, a complex on Newtown Creek where oil has
been stored since after the Civil War. The leaks date at
least to World War II. No oil is known to be leaking now,
although authorities cannot be certain about the condition of
underground pipes at the terminal.

   Manville Trust
   Reorganization
   Due by Aug. 6

   NEW YORK -- A federal judge gave the Manville
personal-injury trust until Aug. 6 to restructure its
financing and to change the way it pays asbestos victims.
   In federal court in Brooklyn, U.S. District Judge Jack B.
Weinstein also issued a temporary stay barring the trust from
paying any settlements, judgments, trustees' fees or
plaintiffs' attorney fees until the changes are made.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You are not going to proceed as you have been in the
past," Judge Weinstein told trust representatives. "Every
penny of the trust's money must be preserved while the
restructuring goes forward."
   Judge Weinstein also urged attorneys on both sides to
consider combining all asbestos personal-injury cases
nationwide. Unless special steps are taken, he warned, the
increasing asbestos caseload may force other asbestos
defendants into bankruptcy and overwhelm the court system.
   The Manville trust, set up by Manville Corp. in 1986 to
pay the company's asbestos personal-injury claims, has come
under fire recently because of its huge cash shortfall. The
trust, which is independent of the company, was the keystone
of Manville's bankruptcy-law reorganization.
   Although a cash shortfall was anticipated at the trust, it
has turned out to be much wider than expected. Current
asbestos claimants are being told that they won't be paid by
the trust for 10 to 20 years -- long after most of the
claimants will have died from the cancer and respiratory
ailments caused by asbestos.
   Questions raised by Judge Weinstein and New York state
Justice Helen Freedman, who are jointly trying to settle
about 500 asbestos cases, triggered intense scrutiny of the
trust several weeks ago.
   Leon Silverman, a special adviser appointed by the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court to review problems at the trust in response
to Judge Weinstein's concerns, conceded yesterday that major
changes are needed. Mr. Silverman played a major role in
designing the trust.
   "It is clear that the trust can't generate sufficient
funds in a timely fashion," Mr. Silverman told the judges. He
said he is making progress in negotiation efforts to improve
the trust's short-term financing.
   Judge Weinstein said the refinancing of the trust could
involve hundreds of millions of dollars in loans or advances
from Manville Corp. The trust's assets are mainly made up of
Manville stock, and the company is to begin contributing part
of its profit to the trust in 1992. The judge said the trust
should also consider acquiring the company or selling its
Manville stock.
   To protect the value of Manville stock, the judge said
that a bankruptcy-court order requiring that all asbestos
lawsuits be filed against the trust, rather than the company,
should continue.
   A spokeswoman for the trust declined to comment on the
judge's order.

   RTC's Powers
   Are Restricted
   In Thrift Case

   A federal judge in Arkansas ruled that the Resolution
Trust Corp. can't override state laws to sell insolvent
thrifts and their branches to banks.
   The ruling, handed down by Judge Stephen Reasoner,
contradicts a ruling last month by a federal judge in Santa
Fe, N.M., and is sure to be appealed by the RTC.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The RTC claims that it has the right, under a regulation
that became effective June 1, to ignore certain state laws,
including those restricting banks' abilities to operate
branches. Arkansas, New Mexico and 10 other states impose
varying branch restrictions.
   But Judge Reasoner decided that the RTC overstepped its
authority in adopting the override regulation and declared it
"unlawful, null and void."
   "There is no doubt that the RTC can more effectively carry
out its mandate (to sell thrifts) if it is allowed to
override state law and receive better bids from purchasers,"
Judge Reasoner wrote. "Congress, had it so intended, could
have given such authority to the RTC."
   Because the judge declared the RTC override regulation
null, the ruling may apply to thrift sales in states other
than Arkansas, said Leonard Rosen, an attorney for the
Arkansas State Bank Department and the Arkansas Independent
Bankers Association. "The judge did not say just Arkansas,"
said Mr. Rosen, who is with the law firm of Bracewell &amp;
Patterson in Washington, D.C.
   Mr. Rosen had filed suit on behalf of the Arkansas State
Bank Department to block the sale of an insolvent Arkansas
thrift and its 20 branches to a unit of Worthen Banking Corp.
   Some of the thrift's branches are outside Worthen's home
county, and operating those branches would have put Worthen
in violation of Arkansas state law. Worthen Chairman Curt
Bradbury said the bank holding company will now reconsider
the acquisition of the thrift, Independence Federal Bank,
which has $172 million in assets.
   RTC spokesmen didn't respond to the Arkansas ruling, but
an appeal is expected in light of the contrary ruling issued
last month by federal Judge Santiago Campos of Santa Fe.
   Judge Campos ruled in favor of the RTC and permitted the
sale of a New Mexico thrift and its out-of-county branches to
a New Mexico bank. An appeal of that ruling is pending in
Denver.

   Perelman Plans
   To Sell Stock
   Of Revlon Unit

   Sale of 13 Million Shares
   In National Health Labs
   Would Help Repay Debt

   NEW YORK -- Revlon Inc. owner Ronald Perelman plans to
sell stock valued at up to $182.1 million in National Health
Laboratories Inc. in a move to repay bank debt and highlight
the value of Revlon's assets.
   The proposed public sale of 13 million shares of National
Health Laboratories, a Revlon subsidiary, follows the
restructuring in May of a $1.8 billion bank loan to Revlon.
Revisions in the loan agreement boosted the amount Revlon
must repay by 1992 to $650 million from $150 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although some bankers said the bank-loan change was
designed to force Revlon to sell assets to make the
repayment, aides to Mr. Perelman said he was free to repay
the debt any way he could, including through asset sales or
refinancing.
   Mr. Perelman, who has operated Revlon with a heavy debt
load since acquiring the cosmetics and health care company in
a hostile takeover in late 1985, wants to reduce Revlon's
debt leverage in coming months, his aides say.
   Some highly leveraged companies have faced financial
pressure in the past year following the collapse of the
market for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds and a reluctance
by banks to make loans for highly leveraged transactions. The
new bank loan for Revlon, which also has $800 million in junk
bonds outstanding, was classified a highly leveraged
transaction.
   In the stock offering announced yesterday, Revlon plans to
reduce its stake in National Health, a medical testing
concern based in La Jolla, Calif., from 95% to 80%. Revlon
founded the company in 1968 in an effort to diversify its
core beauty business.
   Revlon proposed a maximum offering price of $14.50 a
share, the price at which National Health's stock closed on
Friday.
   The stock to be offered consists of 12.6 million shares
owned by Revlon and 441,358 shares owned by Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., the securities firm which financed the Revlon
takeover but whose parent earlier this year sought
bankruptcy-law protection from creditors.
   Some bankers applauded Mr. Perelman's move. "A transaction
like this demonstrates the liquidity of Perelman-controlled
assets," said Michael Zarrilli, a managing director of
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., one of the four lead banks on
the new Revlon loan.
   The stock of National Health Laboratories declined $1.25 a
share to $13.25 a share in national over-the-counter trading
yesterday. With 99 million shares outstanding, that implied a
market value of $1.31 billion for the entire company.
   Some analysts believe that boosting the percentage of
stock traded publicly from 5% to 20% could increase the
accuracy of market value indicated by the stock price. Revlon
sold 5% of the company in 1988.
   Joel M. Ray, a health care industry analyst at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., said the stock offering should be
positive for the price because the increased number of shares
will make it more accessible to institutional investors.
   Since 1985, National Health's revenue has grown 24%
annually and its earnings have grown 31% annually. In 1989,
its earnings were $64.7 million, or 65 cents a share, on
revenues of $402.4 million. Mr. Ray estimates the company
will earn 80 cents a share this year on revenue of $500
million.

   Technology:
   IBM May License
   DRAM Technology
   To Motorola Inc.

   International Business Machines Corp. is considering
licensing some cutting-edge chip technology to Motorola Inc.,
industry executives said.
   The move would help Motorola hedge a huge bet it has made
in the memory-chip area. It also would give IBM another
domestic supplier of memory chips, and it would help
strengthen the beleaguered U.S. semiconductor industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The pairing would be a natural one, because IBM and
Motorola already have a research agreement covering some
advanced semiconductor technology. Any agreement also would
continue a trend in which IBM has shared its semiconductor
technology with U.S. and European companies to strengthen
them against Japanese competitors that IBM fears may become
too powerful.
   For instance, the technology that would be licensed to
Motorola -- for four-megabit dynamic random access memory
chips, or DRAMS, the densest now in commercial use -- is
already licensed to Micron Technology Inc. IBM also had
planned to license the technology to U.S. Memories, the
ill-fated consortium of U.S. chip makers and consumers.
   Both Motorola and IBM declined to confirm or otherwise
comment on their licensing negotiations, which were first
reported yesterday in the New York Times.
   Some consultants and securities analysts speculated that
Motorola is attempting to reduce its dependence on Toshiba
Corp., with which it already has an agreement covering chip
technology. They said that Motorola may be trying to protect
the huge investments it has made in DRAM factories in the
event that there are problems with implementing Toshiba's
design. By licensing the IBM design, Motorola would be simply
lining up a backup technology to ensure that those factories
get up and running, they said.
   "Motorola is making way too big a bet to depend on a
single technology, especially one from a partner that's 6,000
miles away," said Drew Peck of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. "This way, either Toshiba's or IBM's
technology will come through, and they'll be okay."
   Analysts also speculated that the Motorola move may put a
damper on the recent rush by U.S. companies to find Japanese
partners. Five major U.S.-Japanese joint ventures in
semiconductors have been announced since January.
   "This certainly is going to cause some people to think
twice about the commitments they're making," said Will
Strauss of Forward Concepts Co., a Tempe, Ariz.,
market-research firm.
   Like some other analysts, Mr. Strauss pointed to a growing
perception that Japanese companies may be getting the better
deal in such technology-sharing partnerships. "If it turns
out that Motorola isn't happy with a relationship that's a
few years old, people will be more cautious about getting
into these deals," he said.
   Officials from both Motorola and Toshiba denied any
discord between their companies. "Toshiba has been a very
honorable, very equitable partner," a Motorola spokesman
said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Motorola shares closed at $85.50, up 37.5 cents.

   Metzenbaum May Subpoena an Ex-Aide
   To Bush in Inquiry Into Sale of Thrifts
   ----

   WASHINGTON -- Sen. Howard Metzenbaum said he may seek to
subpoena one of President Bush's former aides, who as a
lobbyist helped an Arizona insurance executive buy 15 Texas
thrifts even though his bid was apparently $97 million more
expensive to the government than a competitor's.
   The Ohio Democrat, who is conducting an inquiry into the
government's December 1988 sale of the insolvent savings and
loan associations to James Fail, said he will ask the Senate
Judiciary Committee to subpoena Robert Thompson if he won't
testify voluntarily.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Thompson was an aide to George Bush when he was vice
president. After leaving Mr. Bush's staff, Mr. Thompson wrote
to Danny Wall, then the head of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, urging consideration of Mr. Fail's offer for the S&amp;Ls.
   Sen. Metzenbaum also said he may seek a subpoena for the
testimony of I.C.H. Corp. Chairman Robert Shaw. Sen.
Metzenbaum said at a hearing that Mr. Shaw arranged for
Chicago-based Bankers Life Insurance Co., a unit of I.C.H.,
to loan $35 million to Mr. Fail to back the purchase of the
thrifts, which Mr. Fail consolidated and now runs as
Bluebonnet Savings Bank.
   The senator said documents obtained by investigators on
his staff suggest that Mr. Shaw personally received the right
to 50% of the profits or ownership of Dallas-based
Bluebonnet, although the loans were made by Bankers Life.
   In testimony before the senator's Judiciary subcommittee,
Zack Stamp, the top insurance regulator for the state of
Illinois, wouldn't discuss details of his agency's inquiry
into the matter. However, he said there was "the likelihood
of an administrative or criminal action out of the
information {subcommittee investigators} gave us."
   Mr. Stamp didn't elaborate, but said it was a violation of
Illinois regulations for officers of insurance companies to
engage in activities that would benefit themselves without
reporting such activities to state regulators. A spokesman
for I.C.H., an insurance-holding company based in Louisville,
Ky., didn't return a telephone call seeking comment.
   A lawyer for both Mr. Fail and Mr. Thompson denounced Sen.
Metzenbaum's inquiry as "motivated by sheer political
opportunism" and questioned whether the senator's
subcommittee had the jurisdiction to look into S&amp;L matters.
Another spokesman for Mr. Fail and Mr. Thompson said no
decision had been made on whether the two men will testify
voluntarily.
   Sen. Metzenbaum said he hopes the committee will issue
subpoenas within a week if the two men refuse to testify.
   Mr. Wall, the former Bank Board chairman who oversaw the
sale of the thrifts, said, "there was no political pressure
whatsoever" from Mr. Thompson. In fact, Mr. Wall said, he
knew Weston Edwards, the businessman whose bid was apparently
$97 million cheaper for the government, "better than I knew
Thompson." Mr. Wall said the Bank Board staff recommended Mr.
Fail's bid and "that's what the full board -- two Republicans
and a Democrat -- approved."
   Sen. Metzenbaum said Mr. Wall had declined to testify at
yesterday's hearing. Mr. Wall said he had been invited only
last week, and that he would testify if given enough time to
prepare.
   Sen. Metzenbaum has criticized the sale of the 15 thrifts
as a giveaway in which Mr. Fail put up only $1,000 of his own
money and borrowed $70 million, while the U.S. pledged $1.85
billion in assistance.
   But Stanley Brand, the attorney for Messrs. Fail and
Thompson, said Mr. Fail also "pledged virtually all his
holdings as collateral . . . {It} is ludicrous and unfair to
pretend that he does not have a substantial stake in the
well-being of these institutions."
   Separately, Common Cause, the self-styled citizens lobby,
said that people associated with Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association, Beverly Hills, Calif., gave a total of $284,900
in campaign contributions to political candidates and party
committees from January 1981 through April 1990.
   Last week, the Office of Thrift Supervision filed
administrative charges against Thomas Spiegel, former chief
executive of the thrift, alleging he spent several million
dollars of thrift funds on personal expenses. The thrift
office is seeking a record $24 million in fines and
restitution from Mr. Spiegel, who has denied any wrongdoing.
   Common Cause said that federal filings show Mr. Spiegel
made a $100,000 "soft money" contribution benefiting
President Bush's 1988 campaign. Soft money contributions are
given to political parties and aren't subject to limits of
the federal election laws.
   The Common Cause study showed that Senate Banking
Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) led
congressional recipients of donations from Columbia
officials, their spouses, and Columbia's political action
committee during the period with $29,000. Utah Sen. Jake
Garn, the committee's ranking Republican, was second with
$25,200.
   Sen. Metzenbaum was seventh with $11,000. Sen. Metzenbaum
said at yesterday's hearing, "I raised eight or nine million
dollars for my last campaign. Columbia clearly didn't buy a
friend of the savings-and-loan industry in me."

   OPEC Nations' Heads of State Step In
   To Try to Halt Oil Glut, Fall in Prices

   Kings and presidents are beginning to take a hand in
efforts of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
to try to stop the fall in oil prices.
   Several heads of state of major OPEC members suddenly are
stepping in, where their oil ministers have failed, to try to
curb the organization's overproduction as petroleum markets
weaken from the glut.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One reason is the mounting loss in revenues for OPEC's 13
member nations -- now about $100 million a day -- from the
drop of one-third in the price of petroleum so far this year.
Also, concern is growing that the oil oversupply will trigger
a crash similar to the 1986 collapse that drove the price of
oil as low as $7 a barrel.
   "It's hurting them to the point where they are going to do
something, at least to contain the damage, and a decision to
do something has to come at the heads of state level," said
Paul Mlotok, an oil economist with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   Presidents Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Carlos Andres Perez of
Venezuela and Suharto of Indonesia are among those taking a
harder line toward the quota cheaters, such as Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates, which are held responsible for OPEC's
overproduction. But the king of Saudi Arabia, OPEC's chief
producer, seems to be emerging in the leading role in
charting the new strategy.
   Further evidence of this development came from the Saudi
government. According to an official statement issued by the
Saudi Press Agency, Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, was
quoted as saying King Fahd is "fully committed to restoring
stability to the oil markets."
   Though technical factors also were cited, some oil
analysts said this may have helped spark a late-day rally on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, after several days of
decline. The futures price of crude oil for August delivery
surged in the last few minutes of trading yesterday, to
settle at $16.58 a barrel, up 11 cents from Friday's close,
after falling to a low of $16.05 during the day. Crudes
elsewhere were mostly lower, with North Sea spot prices
dropping between five cents and 45 cents a barrel.
   A report that the Soviet Union, facing a lack of fuel for
domestic use, will cut its oil exports by 140,000 barrels a
day had little impact on world markets. According to the Dow
Jones International Petroleum Report, however, rumors which
were later confirmed that Phibro Energy Inc. sold three
million barrels of North Sea crudes for July loading to the
U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve gave crude spot and futures
prices a boost late in the day.
   The Saudi statement didn't elaborate on steps being taken
by King Fahd, except to quote Mr. Nazer further as saying the
kingdom is exerting "maximum efforts" toward the success of
the OPEC midyear meeting, which is to begin July 25 in
Geneva. Also, the statement noted that Mr. Nazer's comments
were made during a briefing to the Saudi cabinet on his
recent meetings with other Persian Gulf ministers.
   In the past few days, Mr. Nazer has carried a message from
his king regarding the oil situation to Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates, Iraq and Qatar; today, Mr. Nazer's
counterparts from Kuwait, the UAE and Iraq are to meet with
him in Saudi Arabia, in what some oil analysts suggest could
result in a Saudi-engineered compromise proposal to be placed
before the Geneva meeting of all the oil ministers.
Speculation is that such a plan would call for both Kuwait
and the UAE to cut back on output through the third quarter,
in return for higher official quotas in the fourth quarter.
   Iraq's full backing would be necessary for such a plan to
work. The Iraqi president, who wants higher oil prices to
help meet costs of the reconstruction of his country
following its eight-year war against Iran, has been
particularly irritated about the way Kuwait and the UAE have
ignored their quotas.
   Mr. Hussein of Iraq is hardly alone in his irritation. In
Jakarta Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister,
told reporters after a meeting with his president that "there
is no use talking about quotas if the price remains low." He
said that a number of OPEC members have failed to keep their
pledge to help shore up the price of oil by cutting output,
and that OPEC discussions should focus on efforts to improve
the market instead of "wasting time and energy debating on
quota distribution."
   In Caracas, meanwhile, the president of Venezuela also
called for production discipline in OPEC. "Regarding that
situation," he said, "we are promoting a summit meeting of
heads of state . . . of OPEC member countries, which we hope
could take place during the course of this year." Such a
summit, he said, would "discuss current and future issues of
the oil business and reach definite agreements that would
further strengthen" OPEC.

   OTC Focus:
   Market Is Mixed as Nike, K-Swiss Jump;
   Carrington Laboratories Falls 2 1/2 to 17

   The stocks of athletic-footwear makers Nike and K-Swiss
jumped, while the rest of the OTC market stumbled into a
mixed close.
   Nike leaped 7 1/4 to 87 1/4 after turning in a shining
profit report for its fourth quarter ended May 31. The
company earned $1.77 a share, up from 97 cents a year ago.
The earnings were better than analysts had expected and were
over the top of Nike's own projected profit range, which it
had boosted higher in June.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The OTC market's new athletic footwear stock, K-Swiss,
bounded along with Nike, adding 1 1/4 to 27 1/2. K-Swiss,
which specializes in tennis shoes, has gained an incredible
57% since it went public for $17.50 a share in early June.
   But the Nasdaq Composite Index failed to keep up with the
rubber-soled stocks, adding only 1.15, or 0.25%, to 461.68.
Much of that rise came late in the day.
   The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained only
0.23%.
   More stocks fell in price on the OTC market than gained,
however. OTC advancers trailed decliners 925 to 1,030.
   Volume rose to a weak 118.5 million shares from Friday's
anemic 101.4 million shares.
   William R. Rothe, managing director of OTC trading at
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, says that despite the recent light
trading volume institutions are continuing to buy stocks.
   "People are still putting cash to work because they don't
have any viable alternatives," he says.
   Nike drew the loudest cheers in the OTC market. The
company said its world-wide orders for athletic footwear and
apparel scheduled for delivery between June and November 1990
are 42% higher in dollars compared to the same period last
year. Foreign orders are up 70%, Nike said.
   Nike's international business could match its domestic
sales within the next three to five years, says Shearson
Lehman Hutton analyst Josie Esquivel. International sales
comprise only a little more than 20% of the company's
business currently, she says.
   "Basketball is the fastest growing sport in Europe," Ms.
Esquivel says, giving Nike an opportunity to exercise one of
its strongest suits there. Meanwhile, Nike is pursuing other
European sports markets such as soccer, she says.
   "All that put together will continue to give Nike a
tremendous edge overseas," says Ms. Esquivel. She expects the
company's earnings to grow 20% annually for the next three
years. Yesterday, Ms. Esquivel raised her estimate for Nike's
fiscal 1991 profit to $7.80 a share from her earlier estimate
of $7.50 a share.
   Eager investors may get a buying opportunity soon, she
says. Ms. Esquivel believes the market overreacted to
yesterday's earnings news and says the stock will fall back a
bit in the next few days.
   Apple Computer led the most-active list, gaining 1 7/8 to
46 5/8. Soundview Financial Group upgraded its long-term
investment rating on the stock to a "buy" from a "hold"
because of expectation that new product introductions will
help boost Apple's share of the desktop computer market over
the next year, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report.
   Elsewhere on the technology front, 3Com rose 7/8 to 17
5/8. International Business Machines announced a joint
development effort with 3Com to write specifications that
they say will result in customers being able to more
effectively manage different kinds of networks.
   MCI Communications eased 3/4 to 40 7/8. PaineWebber's
telecommunications analyst Jack Grubman says the stock is
reflecting underlying nervousness about second-quarter
earnings in the long-distance telephone industry. He says,
however, that MCI has told analysts that it will meet
expectations.
   MCI's drop and the weakness in other telecommunications
stocks translated into a 1.97-point loss by the Nasdaq
Utility Index to 643.82.
   Laidlaw added 3/4 to 24 1/8. The company's founder,
Michael Degroote, has named Donald Jackson as the new head of
the $2 billion transportation and hazardous-waste managment
company.
   Carrington Laboratories fell 2 1/2 to 17. Yesterday's
"Heard on the Street" column in this newspaper raised
questions about the prospects for use of the company's
Carrisyn drug in treating AIDS. Carrington said its stock has
been the target of a "bear raid" by so-called short sellers,
who sell borrowed stock in hopes of profiting from the
decline in the stock's price.
   DEKALB Genetics lost 1 to 42 1/2. The company said it
expects to report that an unexpectedly large Argentine
currency loss will cut its third quarter profit to less than
half of the 85 cents a share earned in the quarter last year.
   Microlog lost 1 1/4 to 3 1/2. The company said Hambrecht &amp;
Quist cut its earnings estimate for the company's fiscal year
ending in October to 40 cents a share from a previous
estimate of 60 cents. In fiscal 1989, the Germantown,
Md.-based manufacturer of voice-processing systems earned 46
cents a share.

   DALLAS -- The folks at Evergreen Property Capital Corp.
say they can solve the thorny problems facing some of
Southmark Corp.'s limited partnerships.
   There's just one catch: They are some of the same people
who helped create the problems.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As former top executives of Southmark/Envicon Capital
Corp., John Galston and Eugene Rosen helped package and sell
interests in dozens of Southmark private limited partnerships
that raised nearly $400 million. The partnerships, which
invested in health-care properties and other real estate,
were sold to thousands of individual investors who could
afford to pony up $25,000 to $150,000 each.
   Now, many of the partnerships are in trouble, and Messrs.
Galston and Rosen have asked their former customers to trust
them once again. They want investors to join their Limited
Partner Investor Monitoring Committee and help wrest control
from Southmark of 33 partnerships into which investors sank
$130 million to $140 million.
   Sales of limited partnerships bolstered the rapid growth
of Southmark -- once a highflying real estate and thrift
concern -- and contributed to its equally quick demise.
   During much of the 1980s, Southmark bought real estate and
resold it to limited partners, often booking large profits.
Based partly on that apparent financial success, Southmark
was able to sell almost $1 billion in junk bonds with the
help of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., becoming the nation's
largest publicly traded real-estate concern.
   But when tax-law changes stalled syndication sales and a
real-estate recession depressed asset values, Southmark's
cash flow disappeared. Short of funds, it sought
bankruptcy-law protection in July 1989. Meanwhile, its
continued cash bind and its need to cut staff left it
ill-prepared to aid its 335 public and private partnerships
or advise the 145,000 people who invested $2 billion in the
partnerships.
   Campaigning against Southmark, New York-based Evergreen
claims to have received enough proxies to replace Southmark
as general partner of 33 private partnerships that own mostly
health-care properties. Southmark responded by seeking a
court restraining order to stop Evergreen from "unabashedly,
unapologetically attempting to gain control" of the
partnerships.
   Southmark filed eight pages of what it alleged were
misrepresentations by Evergreen principals, including their
purported failure to disclose their former roles in directing
the limited partnerships. A state district judge in Dallas
denied Southmark's request for a restraining order against
Evergreen, and the parties are now negotiating a resolution
of the general partner question, among other issues.
   The negotiations have an added urgency because of hearings
scheduled this week on the confirmation of Southmark's
proposed reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. Southmark and its attorneys are scurrying to
clear up any potential hurdles that could trip up the plan.
   Southmark doesn't dispute that its partnerships should
have new general partners who could then choose management
companies to run partnership properties and work on revising
loan agreements. Because many of the properties currently
don't generate enough cash flow to make debt payments, "to
survive long-term, these partnerships are going to need (new)
capital," says Bruce Schnitz, Southmark executive vice
president. But, he says, Southmark is "trying to be cautious
in trying to find" new general partners.
   Certainly, many of Southmark's partnership investors would
like a change. Since Southmark initiated Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization a year ago, it has stopped
subsidizing distributions to partners and halted mortgage
payments on some properties, putting them in danger of
foreclosure. Auditors have questioned whether many of the
partnerships can continue as going concerns.
   Individually, however, investors have almost no say in how
the partnerships are run, and few have the deep pockets or
knowledge to round up the support of other investors and
challenge Southmark in trying to salvage troubled properties.
That makes them dependent on whatever arrangements Southmark
and groups like Evergreen can agree on.
   But whether the Evergreen group offers a worthwhile
alternative is another question. The group and its Limited
Partner Investor Monitoring Committee have been sharply
critical of Southmark for failing to live up to its
projections for the partnerships and have raised questions
about accounting practices since the partnerships were first
offered. The committee provided analyses of Southmark
partnerships to investors for a fee of about 1% of their
original investment, or about $250 on an investment of
$25,000.
   What the committee glosses over is that Messrs. Galston
and Rosen helped put together those projections and monitored
the 33 partnerships and many others as the top executives of
Southmark/Envicon Capital, the unit that marketed private
partnership interests.
   In its request for a restraining order, Southmark claims
that the executives, among other things, "were involved in
determining the price and financial structure of the property
to be acquired by the partnerships . . . developing the
schedule of the limited partners' capital contributions;
structuring the distribution guarantees (and) preparing the
offering memorandum distributed to investors."
   More particularly, Southmark alleged in the filing, "Mr.
Galston has failed to disclose to the limited partners that
he played a major role in management decisions in his
capacity as a general partner of the entity that served as a
general partner of the partnerships."
   Mr. Galston, who left Southmark with Mr. Rosen in August
1988, after the partnership business dried up, contends that
he and his partners simply relied on numbers and data put
together by others at Southmark. He said the two men were
responsible primarily for selling the partnership interests,
while others handled the operations and accounting.
   "We feel we were duped as well," Mr. Galston says. "We put
the (offering) documents together based on information put
together by operating divisions."
   But, argues William S. Friedman, the former vice chairman
of Southmark, "it's a little disingenuous for them to
criticize their own work and say you ought to pay us to fix
things. I don't think a group of extremely well-compensated
former executives should be looked on as potential saviors."
   Messrs. Galston and Rosen argue that if they are elected,
they will try to negotiate lower management fees for the
partnership properties. Currently, the partnerships pay about
5% to 7.5% of their revenue to property managers, many of
which are Southmark affiliates.
   However, Messrs. Galston and Rosen are asking limited
partners to pay a separate fee equal to 1.75% of revenues to
their committee as a general partner's fee; in most cases,
the limited partners already paid fees for a Southmark unit
to be general partner when they purchased partnership
interests.
   Meanwhile, Southmark says in its lawsuit that changing the
general partner could trigger debt covenants that may
automatically put some properties in default. Many of those
mortgages are with San Jacinto Savings Association, a
Southmark unit, or other Southmark affiliates.
   The Evergreen principals dispute Southmark's reading of
the debt covenants, saying that Southmark is actually
threatening to have its affiliates foreclose on the
properties.
   Southmark's private-partnership investors aren't the only
ones under siege. Quest Partners, formed by two former
Southmark salesmen, solicited votes from investors to become
the general partner of three public Southmark partnerships.
The roughly 8,000 investors in those partnerships voted last
month on Quest's solicitation; a final tabulation is expected
within a few weeks.
   Southmark already lost its general partner interest in a
public health-care partnership to Life Care Centers of
America, a closely held company. In part because Life Care
currently manages some Southmark-sponsored properties,
Southmark recently agreed to merge its partly owned National
Heritage Inc. unit with Life Care and turn over general
partner interests in many health-care partnerships to the
Cleveland, Tenn., company. Southmark also is trying to sell a
package of its general partner interests and mortgages in
more than 200 partnerships, as part of its plan to quit the
partnership business and emerge from bankruptcy largely as a
thrift-holding company.
   The partnership tug-of-wars can be trying for even the
most seasoned of investors. Consider Frank Loudermilk, a
retired Kentucky lobbyist, who in 1987 sank $100,000 into a
Southmark/Envicon partnership that purchased a Florida
nursing home. That partnership will be managed by Life Care
if the Life Care-National Heritage merger goes through.
   No investment rookie, Mr. Loudermilk didn't invest until
he had pored over documents and even visited the thriving
facility. But even though the nursing home is 97.5% occupied,
it loses money because of the large interest payments on its
debt, according to partnership financial statements.
   Mr. Loudermilk, acknowledging that he is "completely
confused," decided that he wouldn't vote in the proxy battle,
even though he sent in some money to the Evergreen group.
Instead, he will wait to see if Southmark's agreement with
Life Care improves the future of his investment.

   HOUSTON -- Academics and activists again set out to
present the perspective of impoverished nations as a backdrop
to the annual proceedings of the economic summit of
industrialized nations.
   Since 1984, The Other Economic Summit, a loose coalition
of environmentalists, Third World feminists, labor and
political leaders and citizens groups, have convened just
prior to the economic summit of the world's wealthiest
nations. TOES, as it is known, strives to be the conscience
of that meeting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This year, here, populist leaders from the world's poorer
regions called for a cancelation of all foreign debt owed by
the Third World, charging debt service has made them "new
colonial tributaries." Summiteers at the alternative meeting
also called for broader environmental initiatives on toxic
waste, other pollution and the global-warming phenomenon.
   Organizers say they will deliver their communiques to the
United Nations and are attempting to submit it to the U.S.
delegation gathered in Houston for the summit of
industrialized nations, which are the so-called Group of
Seven: the U.S., Japan, West German, France, Britain, Italy
and Canada.
   The counter-summit was a low-budget contrast to the main
one. Nearly 1,000 participated in the conclave across from
Houston's Astrodome, where President Bush entertained his
wealthy guests Sunday with a welcoming rodeo and comedian
Minnie Pearl. TOES summiteers were entertained by Himalayan
bell music and a political satirist. A "stress release for
world peace" booth offered up massages to many takers.
   While the world's press here for the G-7 summit were feted
and fed at four of Houston's museums this past weekend, the
counter-summit took a handful of reporters to tour shoddy
housing conditions in the city's Fourth Ward, whose clapboard
shanties jar into a nearby horizon of gleaming skyscrapers.
   A Paris coordinator for last year's TOES summit in France,
a socialist democracy, lamented the shrunken participation at
this year's event and the shrunken publicity. "At the end of
the (Paris) summit . . . because of the press coverage, they
(the industrialized nations) had to meet us," said Anne
Sophie Boisgallais of Paris.
   TOES bills itself as an alternative summit of "seven of
the world's poorest people," though eight groups were
highlighted. This year's representatives came from
Bangladesh, Haiti, Colombia, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, the
Philippines, and Nigeria. The eighth group, Native Americans,
were "observers" to the alternative summit, as
representatives of the European Community are observers at
the G-7 summit, an organizer said.
   Many conferees came across the border to Texas from
neighboring Mexico. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a 1988 presidential
candidate in Mexico and the son of a former president, won a
standing ovation when he told the crowd that Third World
nations "don't agree to be treated as merchandise . . . as a
territory to be distributed among industrialized countries."
   Joined in a communique by former presidential candidates
from Brazil and Colombia, Mr. Cardenas also said that drug
trafficking is a "transnational business based in the U.S."
and that it can't be used as "an excuse for U.S. military and
political intervention in Latin American countries, as
recently happened in Panama."

   U.S. Set Back in Court in Chicago Traders Case

   CHICAGO -- The federal assault on trading fraud at
Chicago's big futures markets received a major setback in its
first courtroom test.
   A jury was able to reach guilty verdicts on only eight of
the more than 100 criminal counts filed against three Swiss
franc futures traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The
jury reached verdicts of not guilty on 22 counts and were
deadlocked on 86 counts. The jury found one defendant not
guilty on two counts and was deadlocked on 12 other counts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The jury wasn't able to reach a verdict on more than
two-thirds of the counts. Judge Ann Williams declared a
mistrial on the counts on which the jury was deadlocked.
   Prosecutors said they likely would attempt to retry the
case on the undecided counts. Defense attorneys say that a
retrial would be a travesty of justice. "The government gave
this their best shot," one attorney said. Even if the counts
are retried, the government has already lost the valuable
momentum it would have gained from an overwhelming number of
guilty verdicts in the first trial.
   "Any time the government convicts on only eight of more
than 100 counts in an investigation of this magnitude, it's a
major setback," said Robert Tarun, a defense attorney and
former assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago.
   Even the guilty verdicts were a Pyrrhic victory for the
government's multimillion-dollar investigation of fraud on
the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, which spanned more
than two years and involved the use of undercover agents on
the floors of the exchanges.
   Robert Mosky, 34 years old, who had been charged with 82
counts, was found guilty of seven counts, all relatively
lesser violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The jury
found him not guilty on 20 counts and was deadlocked on 55
counts.
   The jury found trader Danny Scheck, 28, guilty on one
count of violating the act, for a trade that allegedly cost a
futures trading customer $50, said his attorney Harvey
Silets. The jury was deadlocked on the remaining 19 counts
against Mr. Scheck.
   David Zatz, 43, the third defendant, was found not guilty
on two counts of CEA violations, with the jury deadlocked on
the remaining 12 counts against him.
   The jury's surprise actions could cripple the
unprecedented government probe. It casts doubt on the
government's ability to extend significantly the
investigation's reach beyond the 48 individuals indicted on
fraud charges last year at the Merc and the CBOT.
   The government will be forced to reconsider plans to
indict many more traders if the evidence against them isn't
any stronger than that rejected by the jury in the
Swiss-franc case.
   The jury's action also could embolden already indicted
traders. The verdict all but eliminates the chance that any
of the 29 indicted traders to be tried in September in two
separate proceedings will plead guilty and cooperate with
prosecutors before going to trial, defense attorneys said.
   The jury was deadlocked on the most significant charge in
the trial: a conspiracy count against Mr. Mosky under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.
The deadlock could rekindle criticism of government
overreaching in the probe. If found guilty of racketeering,
Mr. Mosky could have been forced to forfeit such assets as
his exchange membership as well as profits earned when the
alleged conspiracy was taking place.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Fleissner defended the use
of RICO. When asked if he thought the jury's partial verdict
was an embarrassment for the government and a misuse of
government resources, he said, "I don't think people who
invest in the commodity markets would agree."
   The verdict is not a clean bill of health for the futures
industry. The jury in the criminal trial had to find that the
evidence proved the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt. But the evidence, especially testimony from Mark
Fuhrman and William Walsh, two Swiss-franc traders who
pleaded guilty to fraud and testified against the defendants,
depicted the Merc pit as corrupt.
   Sixteen of the 48 indicted individuals from both exchanges
have pleaded guilty to fraud and are cooperating with the
probe.
   Mr. Fuhrman said he had been stealing customer profits
since the late 1970s in a handful of Merc trading pits,
including the Swiss-franc pit. Mr. Walsh, 22 years old when
the alleged fraud was carried out, described skimming
customer profits as one of the survival skills successful
traders had to master on the Merc floor. He said he made
illegal trades several times a month in the Swiss-franc pit.
   After the federal investigation of futures trading fraud
surfaced early last year both the Merc and the Board of Trade
took a number of steps to tighten trading operations. The
exchanges stiffened penalties for trading violations and
passed other rule changes aimed at making fraudulent trades
easier to detect. Both exchanges also are developing
hand-held terminals for pit brokers that are designed to
create a better audit trail that will enable exchange
surveillance staff to detect fraud.
   Mr. Silets said the verdicts "demonstrate the jury wasn't
convinced there was a conspiracy to cheat and defraud
customers in the Swiss-franc pit at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange." Even though Mr. Scheck and Mr. Zatz weren't
charged with racketeering conspiracy, the government alleged
that they took part in the trading conspiracy that was the
basis for the RICO charge against Mr. Mosky.
   Elliot Samuels, Mr. Mosky's attorney, said, "there are
many things about the government's theory that the jury
didn't buy." He added, "I don't think anything about this
case was appropriate" for the use of RICO charges against Mr.
Mosky.
   The prosecution alleged, among other things, that the
traders conspired to keep Mr. Mosky from absorbing trading
losses on customer orders by arranging for Mr. Scheck and Mr.
Zatz, as well as other unindicted Swiss-franc traders, to
accept losing trades into their accounts. Mr. Mosky then
allegedly repaid them with non-competitive trades on which
they could immediately earn a profit in the pit. The
government claimed these profits belonged to Mr. Mosky's
customers.
   The jury members deliberated for 11 days and nearly 70
hours before telling the judge that further deliberations
wouldn't help them reach a decision on the remaining counts.
   The jury apparently wasn't persuaded by the more than 100
snippets of taped conversations in the Swiss-franc pit and
elsewhere that the government claimed proved the traders were
guilty of 116 counts of fraud. The jurors asked for the
complete trial transcript of more than 4,000 pages to help
reach a decision. Last week, the jury told the judge they
were deadlocked on an unspecified number of counts. She sent
them back to the jury room at that time and instructed them
to reconsider every count.
   Last Friday the jury said it would be able to reach a
verdict if it were allowed to visit the Merc floor and
observe trading in the Swiss-franc pit. Judge Williams denied
the request, apparently agreeing with prosecutors that a
visit would be equivalent to admitting new evidence into the
trial record.
   The final note saying the jury was deadlocked was sent to
the judge yesterday afternoon. Sentencing was set for Nov. 2
regarding the guilty verdicts against Mr. Mosky and Mr.
Scheck.
   A Chicago Merc spokesman said the exchange's board of
governors will discuss at their regular meeting tomorrow what
action, if any, to take against the convicted traders.

   LOS ANGELES -- Hughes Aircraft Co. Chairman Malcolm R.
Currie denied that he improperly handled Pentagon budget
secrets in the early 1980s, maintaining that such allegations
are based on "innunendoes and hearsay."
   In response to a Wall Street Journal story last Friday
about an ongoing federal grand jury probe of illegal
gathering and swapping of Pentagon budget documents, Mr.
Currie issued a letter to employees of Hughes, a unit of
General Motors Corp. In the five-paragraph letter, Mr. Currie
said, "I did not know or approve of the unlawful activities
in question." The letter also said that prosecutors "advised
us that I am not a target of this criminal investigation."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Further, he said, "I offered my testimony freely and
voluntarily" to federal investigators and no civil lawsuit is
"contemplated against Hughes or myself" by the government.
   Mr. Currie declined to be interviewed for last Friday's
Journal story. The company issued a brief comment saying that
Mr. Currie "did not have any knowledge" of illegal conduct by
a Hughes employee convicted last month of trafficking in
bootlegged Pentagon documents.
   The story said Mr. Currie had been under criminal
investigation, and had been interviewed by federal
investigators, but wasn't a target of the grand jury inquiry.
Law enforcement officials in Washington couldn't be reached
yesterday, but repeatedly have indicated that they haven't
ruled out some sort of civil action against Mr. Currie and
others.

   Industrial Stocks Rise 9.16 Points
   On Late Rally; Trading Is Quiet

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices moved higher as a late burst of
futures-related buying set the course for an otherwise
directionless market.
   Trading activity, which dropped to the lowest levels of
the year last week amid the observance of Independence Day,
remained light.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, boosted by strong
performances from General Motors and International Business
Machines, gained 9.16 points to 2914.11 -- its seventh
advance in the past eight sessions.
   Broader market measures also moved higher. Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 1.10 to 359.52 and the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index added 0.45 to 196.23.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 764 to 673 on
the New York Stock Exchange, where 119,390,000 shares were
traded. By comparison, the Big Board's average daily volume
last week was 125.8 million shares, including just 111.7
million on Friday; both totals were 1990 lows.
   Second-quarter earnings reports will begin flooding the
market late this week, and traders said nervousness about the
possibility that the data may produce some unpleasant
surprises kept investors on the sidelines.
   "Everyone's in a holding pattern here; it's pretty
self-evident," said Christopher Pedersen, head of trading at
Twenty-First Securities. "A lot of people are leery about
those numbers coming out."
   Last month, analysts' consensus earnings projections for
1990 were revised downward on 44.9% of the more than 3,000
companies that are followed by Nelson's Earnings Outlook, a
Port Chester, N.Y.based service.
   Earnings forecasts for this year were revised upward on
only 27.6% of the companies, Nelson's reported, while the
other 27.5% were left unchanged.
   Amid the earnings jitters, program buying linked to
stock-index arbitrage-buying baskets of stocks and selling
index-futures contracts to profit from price differences
between the two -- surfaced in early trading to help the
market rally to session highs. The industrial average peaked
with a gain of more than 15 points.
   But the rally faded once the buy programs subsided, and
the market stood little changed from midday until two more
rounds of arbitrage buying lifted share prices in the last
hour of trading.
   The programs hit the market amid the release of results
from the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and
six-month bills, at which a record $18.04 billion of
securities were sold. Treasury notes and bonds bounced off
their lows following release of the auction results.
   GM, whose Hughes Aircraft and Delco Electronics units
unveiled a new electronics joint venture, rallied 1 1/8 to
49. IBM rose 1 to 119, reflecting strength among major
technology issues; Compaq Computer rose 3 1/4 to 64 3/4,
Digital Equipment advanced 1 1/2 to 84 7/8 and Cray Research
gained 1 to 46.
   Philip Morris dropped 3/8 to 48 7/8 in Big Board composite
trading of 2.7 million shares after a story in Barron's
magazine highlighted the problems facing the tobacco
industry, including anti-smoking sentiment world-wide and
cigarette-tax increases. Loews, the owner of Lorillard, eased
1 3/4 to 111 1/8 and Liggett Group fell 1/4 to 12 1/8, but
American Brands added 5/8 to 67 1/4 after trading as low as
65 7/8.
   UAL climbed 4 3/8 to 157 1/8 after the company's unions
disclosed that Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust New
York, Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical Banking have agreed
to lead the labor group's effort to obtain financing for
their proposed $4.38 billion buy-out of United Airlines,
UAL's major unit.
   Wal-Mart Stores gained 1 1/2 to 32 3/4 on 2.7 million
shares on anticipation of a strong June sales report,
expected Thursday. Analysts estimate that last month's sales
at stores open at least a year were 10% to 14% higher than a
year ago, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report. Separately, Wal-Mart agreed to acquire the book and
record distribution and warehousing units of Western
Merchandisers for stock valued at $28 million.
   Wal-Mart Stores and Compaq Computer both advanced
yesterday after 2-for-1 stock splits. The post-split gains
may be a sign of avid buying by small investors, said Bernard
Schaeffer, executive director of the Investment Research
Institute in Cincinnati. "Stock splits are starting to
attract a wider spectrum of investor interest," he said.
Splits in Philip Morris, Federal National Mortgage
Association and Du Pont in the past year didn't result in a
surge of new buying interest, he added.
   TCBY Enterprises dropped 1 5/8 to 15 1/2 on 1.9 million
shares after Shearson Lehman Hutton reduced its investment
rating on the stock for the second time since the July Fourth
holiday. In addition, analyst Caroline Levy lowered her
projections of the company's earnings for 1990 and 1991 to
last year's level of $1.10 a share.
   She told the investor report her revised forecasts reflect
expectations that because of growing competition in the
frozen-yogurt market, the company will cut the price of
yogurt to its franchisees in the third quarter and
development of new stores will slow next year. A company
spokeswoman told the investor report that TCBY "strongly
disagrees" with Shearson's revised estimates and expects to
meet its target of about 400 new stores next year.
   General Instrument went up 5/8 to 46 1/4. The company,
which has accepted a buyout offer of $44.50 a share from
Forstmann Little, disclosed that another party requested
certain financial information from it last week.
   Quantum Chemical, which fell 1 1/4 Friday, dropped another
1 to 14 3/8 as Salomon Brothers and Mabon Nugent lowered
their estimates of the company's 1990 and 1991 earnings,
based on lower polyethelene prices. Goldman Sachs had reduced
its estimates Friday.
   Crown Cork &amp; Seal gained 2 1/4 to 63 1/8 following news
that Chairman John F. Connelly, 85 years old, died Sunday
night. Mr. Connelly had controlled a stake of about 17.6% in
the company, which hasn't paid a common-stock dividend since
1956, the year before he became chief executive.
   Maytag gained 1/2 to 17 3/8. USA Today reported, without
elaborating, that Hanson PLC of Britain is rumored to be
eyeing the company as a possible takeover target.
   Long Island Lighting went up 1/4 to 20 5/8. Standard &amp;
Poor's raised its ratings on some of the company's debt
issues to investment grade, based on expectations that the
company will be able to end its involvement with the Shoreham

   CHICAGO -- In the latest combination of Chicago futures
and options acumen and foreign financial clout, Chicago
Research &amp; Trading Group Ltd. said it agreed to form a
trading joint venture with Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking Corp.,
Japan's largest trust bank.
   The CRT Group joint venture will give the closely held
Chicago trading company increased access to Japanese
financial markets and Mitsubishi's corporate customer base,
said Malcolm Hanney, CRT Group executive vice president. The
joint venture, which is subject to regulatory approval in the
U.S. and Japan, will emphasize off-exchange trading of
currency and interest-rate management products, he said.

   Late last month, the futures brokerage unit of
Chicago-based Rodman &amp; Renshaw Capital Group Inc. said it was
forming a futures trading joint venture with
Creditanstalt-Bankverein, the largest Austrian bank, to tap
Central and Eastern European markets. And O'Connor &amp;
Associates, a closely held Chicago trading firm, formed a
futures and options trading joint venture with Swiss Bank
Corp. last December.
   Chicago's futures and options exchanges are the world's
most active, but their individual member firms have
traditionally been relatively undercapitalized. To tap the
growing global off-exchange markets in options and other
so-called derivative financial products, trading firms are
increasingly turning to banks or other deep-pocketed partners
to provide the necessary credit backing.
   Trading firms need to significantly boost their financial
backing to participate in off-exchange transactions made
directly with other financial institutions-transactions that
don't have the benefit of an exchange clearinghouse, where
members pool funds to assume the credit risk of every
transaction.
   CRT Group's primary dealer in government securities, CRT
Government Securities Ltd., is expected to be incorporated
into the joint venture, Mr. Hanney said.

   Lawmakers and IRS Seek to Intensify Study
   Of Taxes Paid by U.S. Units of Foreign Firms

   WASHINGTON -- Reps. Duncan Hunter and Tom Campbell have
some advice for federal budget negotiators wrestling with new
tax proposals.
   Get the foreigners first.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Soon after President Bush recanted his no-new-taxes
pledge, the two California Republicans wrote a letter to
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
urging the negotiators "to take a very close look at taxes
owed by foreign-owned businesses before any new revenue
provisions are adopted." Not only are the taxes paid by
foreign-controlled U.S. corporations "unusually low" compared
with their gross receipts, wrote Messrs. Hunter and Campbell,
but the companies are "paying much lower taxes overall than
their foreign counterparts."
   Washington hasn't heard the end of this issue.
   The Government Oversight subcommittee of the House Ways
and Means Committee opens hearings today on whether the
growing number of U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations
are paying all the tax they owe the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Commissioner Fred Goldberg will present new figures
showing that in 1987 foreign firms paid taxes on less than 1%
of their gross receipts -- well below the tax levels of
domestic companies. And even more disturbing to many members
of Congress, the IRS figures will show that while sales of
Japanese-owned companies rose nearly 50% in 1987, the
reported income they paid taxes on dropped two-thirds.
   Against the backdrop of painful budget talks and concern
that the U.S. is loosing its competitive standing in the
world, the figures are certain to touch a political nerve.
   "I'm convinced that many foreign companies are in effect
committing fraud," says James Wheeler, an accounting
professor at the University of Michigan and a former IRS
official who is scheduled to testify at the hearings.
   In public and private sessions, subcommittee investigators
plan to present evidence showing that a number of U.S. units
of foreign corporations -- particularly in the automobile,
electronics and motorcycle industries -- are illegally
reducing their taxable income here by paying excessively high
prices to their foreign parents for goods, parts, services
and technology. U.S. tax law says parents must charge the
same prices that subsidiaries would pay on the open market.
   The issue, which has been simmering for several months, is
an alluring one for lawmakers. IRS officials have said that
at least $12 billion is in question in audits of
foreign-controlled U.S. companies. "We want the taxes that
foreign companies owe the United States before we ask the
American people for one more cent," said Rep. Hunter after
writing the letter to budget negotiators.
   Two of the House's most influential members, Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) and Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.), have
introduced legislation to strengthen IRS enforcement powers
against foreign companies and for the first time subject
foreigners to a capital-gains tax when they sell stock of
U.S. companies. A companion bill is pending in the Senate.
Given its powerful backers, some people believe the measure
is a strong candidate for inclusion in any budget package
this year.
   Other prominent lawmakers are also raising an eyebrow at
the tax bills of foreign-controlled companies. At a Senate
Finance Committee hearing this spring on the shortfall in
U.S. corporate-tax receipts overall, Chairman Lloyd Bentsen
(D., Texas) wondered if evasion by foreign-controlled
companies could be partly responsible. His staff is looking
into the issue and he is considering holding hearings on it.
Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the ranking Republican on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has asked the General
Accounting Office, Congress's investigative arm, to examine
the matter. "Tens of billions of dollars are at stake," Sen.
Helms contended in a speech on the Senate floor recently.
   The issue has spread beyond Washington, too. Rep. Campbell
held a dozen townhall meetings in his Silicon Valley district
over two recent weekends. "This came up at every one," he
says.
   In recent years, the IRS has quietly stepped up its audits
of foreign-controlled companies as more and more foreign
companies have opened operations in the U.S. The tax agency
has also begun turning more attention to U.S. branches of
foreign banks, believing they are improperly allocating
interest costs. In audits of 10 foreign banks last year, the
IRS walked away with an additional $100 million, according to
Donald Houck, the tax agency's deputy assistant commissioner
for international matters.
   But representatives of foreign companies and foreign
governments are making the rounds on Capitol Hill and at the
Treasury to defend themselves. "This is part of an overall
effort that is not good for the American economy," says
Sandra Taylor of the Organization for Fair Treatment of
International Investors, a group of about 30 U.S.
subsidiaries of foreign -- largely European -- companies. She
notes that 90% of member companies' employees are American.
   And some critics charge that Washington's growing
preoccupation with foreign taxpayers is tinged with
xenophobia. They quickly note that the industries the House
subcommittee is focusing on -- electronics, automobiles and
motorcycles -- are dominated world-wide by the Japanese and
contend that the allegations are one more form of
Japan-bashing. U.S. officials respond that they're logically
looking at the industries with the most foreign activity.
"You don't see a whole lot of investigation of nuclear
reactors or airplanes because there aren't a whole lot of
{foreign} nuclear reactors or airplanes sold in the U.S.,"
says Charles Triplett, IRS deputy associate chief counsel for
international matters.
   Nevertheless, some tax practitioners see a clear bias.
"With companies that are foreign-owned, there's a higher
level of investigation, more voluminous document requests,
and I'd say less subjectivity," says Eli Fink, an
international tax partner at the accounting firm Deloitte &amp;
Touche.
   An IRS auditor recently challenged a transaction between
one of Mr. Fink's clients, a U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese
company, and a separate Japanese company. subject to higher
tax because it was between two related companies.
   "We said we were not related to that company," Mr. Fink
says. "But the agent wrote in his report that we know all
Japanese companies are interrelated."
   Concern over whether foreign-controlled U.S. companies are
paying their fair share of U.S. tax was triggered several
months ago by 1986 IRS statistics, the most recent available
at the time, showing gross receipts of foreign companies
filing tax returns in the U.S. totaled $543 billion that year
while their taxable income amounted to a negative $1.5
billion.
   But 1986 was the only recent year that overall taxable
income was negative. The Organization for Fair Treatment of
International Investors hired the accounting firm KPMG Peat
Marwick to study the issue. It concluded that a plunge in the
value of the dollar that year drove up the costs of
foreign-owned companies and consequently decreased their
income.
   The report also says that from 1983 through 1986 the
average effective tax rate for foreign-owned companies in the
U.S. was slightly higher than that for U.S. companies if
measured as a percent of assets or net worth. Statistics for
1987 show net income of foreign-controlled companies jumped
to more than $5 billion.
   Whether people believe foreign-controlled companies are
attempting tax evasion or not, many will argue in the
hearings that the IRS needs more powers to find out.

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices continued to sag over Friday's
unexpectedly strong employment report and concerns about how
well the market will absorb this week's heavy load of
government offerings.
   Stocks drifted higher in thin trading. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average added 9.16 points to close at 2914.11. The
dollar was mixed, but surprisingly stable, considering all
the focus on the ebullient British pound.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell nearly half a
point, or $5 for each $1,000 of face amount. But trading was
light as investors waited to see how today's Resolution
Funding Corp. auction of $5 billion of 30-year bonds goes.
Adding to the supply tomorrow will be the government's sale
of $8 billion of seven-year notes.
   "Supply is weighing heavily on people's minds," said
Michael Rosen, an analyst at First Interstate Bank, Los
Angeles.
   In the stock market, investors are nervously awaiting the
onslaught of second-quarter earnings reports and watching how
the bond market responds to its new supply. Hugh Johnson,
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp., said, "Nobody
wants to be a hero and step up to the plate before we see
those earnings reports."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose on volume of 119.4 million shares in the
New York Stock Exchange trading. Advancing issues edged out
decliners, 764-673.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.54%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar ended mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6530 marks and 151.15 yen, compared
with 1.6520 marks and 151.70 yen Friday.

   Consumer Credit
   Posts Strong Rate
   Of Growth for May

   WASHINGTON -- Boosted by a strong increase in retail and
bank card borrowing, consumer credit grew at a 6.5% annual
rate in May, the Federal Reserve Board said.
   Credit owed by consumers, generally all forms of personal
debt excluding mortgages, rose $3.91 billion in May, the
largest increase since October of last year when consumer
debt climbed $4.43 billion, the Fed said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The May rise follows a weak increase of $390 million in
April, or an annual rate of 0.6%. The April figures were
lowered from a 1.0% increase, or $584 million.
   Showing the biggest increase, revolving credit, mainly
retail and bank card debt, rose $3.13 billion in May,
amounting to an annual growth rate of 18.5%. The May increase
comes after a rise at a 10.1% annual rate one month before.
   Despite May's significant growth, some analysts said
consumer attitudes on borrowing remain the same.
   "I don't think this month's {May's} increase is enough to
say anything has changed," said David Berson of the Federal
National Mortgage Association here. "If you look at the
average over the past five months, the average is $1.6
billion per month . . . consumer borrowing has slowed, not
increased since last year."
   Nevertheless, Mr. Berson said he found the latest figures
to be encouraging because they show that consumer borrowing
is appropriate for the current expansion rate of the economy.
   "Since we are very close to full employment . . . the
economy needs to grow a little less slowly to fight
inflation," he said. "Too much borrowing now would almost
certainly lead to inflation."
   Automobile credit was still weak in May, falling $87
million, at a 0.4% annual rate, following an April decline of
$1.99 billion, or at an annual rate of 8.2%.

   NEW YORK -- Coach Leatherwear Co. has filed a lawsuit in
federal court against Ann Taylor, a New York-based women's
retail chain, and two other defendants for selling handbags
that it says copy three of its best-known and recognized
styles.
   In a lawsuit filed on May 21 in the Southern District of
New York, Coach charged that the defendants' sale of
allegedly imitation Coach bags constituted "false
designations of origin and false and misleading descriptions"
with the intention of "creating confusion and deception in
the marketplace . . . and for the purpose of implying an
association between these products sold by Ann Taylor and
Coach."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Coach seeks a jury trial and damages "in excess of
$500,000."
   Neither Ann Taylor nor the other defendants returned phone
calls seeking comment.
   In court papers, Coach charged that Laura Leather Ltd.,
the manufacturer of the bags, made identical copies of the
Coach handbags and sold them to Ann Taylor. Coach claims that
since 1973 it has sold $400 million worth of handbags.
   "There are millions of versions of Coach bags and Coach
has never complained, but these are exact imitations, you
can't tell the difference," said Daniel Ebenstein, the
attorney representing Coach. He said that "Coach has received
many complaints from Coach customers who believe that we are
making special private-label products for Ann Taylor, which
is reselling them for 30% less than Coach stores."
   He said that since the suit was filed one of the
defendants, Ron's Elegance Center, a New York retail shop,
has agreed to stop selling the handbags.
   "Ann Taylor told us that they have no intention of
reordering the bags, but they are not willing to consent to
an injuntion, therefore we are proceeding with our case," Mr.
Ebenstein said.
