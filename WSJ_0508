   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Siliconix Inc. said it is in direct
negotiations with International Rectifier Corp. with regard
to an April 9 patent infringement ruling.
   A federal judge ruled in April that the semiconductor
maker had infringed on certain patents related to
International Rectifier's power transistor technology. Partly
as a result of the adverse judgment, Siliconix subsequently
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Siliconix said it has met with International Rectifier
several times since the court ruling, and added that it hopes
the parties can reach an agreement soon to resolve the
four-year-old dispute.

   Nothing `Perverse'
   In Pulitzer's Choice
</HL>
<DATE>

</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A25
</SO>
<LP>
   In his article on the Pulitzer Prize recently awarded
August Wilson's "The Piano Lesson," Edwin Wilson makes much
of the fact that the Pulitzer Prize Board "reserves the right
to ignore the recommendations" of its advisory juries ("A
`Lesson' in Pulitzer Perversity," Leisure &amp; Arts, April 23).
In reality, that is a right that is not invoked in the great
majority of instances and, in any case, the point has no real
bearing on the particular award with which Mr. Wilson
concerned himself. In giving the 1990 drama award to "The
Piano Lesson," the Pulitzer board, in fact, chose one of the
plays that the three critics who constituted this year's
drama jury recommended as finalists.
   No less tangential is Mr. Wilson's implications that the
fact that the prize-winning version of "The Piano Lesson" was
first produced outside New York City somehow had major
relevance to its eligibility for the 1990 drama prize.
Actually, the determining consideration was not where the
play was produced but whether it was still identical to the
version first put on at the Yale Repertory Theater in 1987.
For while there is no flat prohibition in the Pulitzer bylaws
against considering the same play in successive years, the
prize board would almost certainly have been hesitant to give
the 1990 award to a work it had bypassed earlier and that had
undergone no meaningful evolution since then.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Wilson holds the view that the current version of "The
Piano Lesson" is "much the same" as the one he saw in New
Haven in 1987. The chairman of the this year's Pulitzer drama
jury on the other hand felt that the two were significantly
different. Instead of the "perversity" of the Pulitzer Prize
Board, then, the true cause of Mr. Wilson's complaint would
appear to lie in a difference of opinion between himself and
some other professional drama critics.

   Stocks Chalk Up Sixth Gain in Row

   NEW YORK -- Stocks closed higher for the sixth consecutive
session, with technology shares leading the market.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 11.26 to 2721.62,
a rise of 0.42%. Among the broader averages, Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index added 2.14, or 0.63%, to 340.53, and
the New York Stock Exchange Composite index gained 1.07, or
0.58%, to 186.45.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Volume totaled 132,760,000 shares on the New York Stock
Exchange, where advancing issues led decliners, 943 to 571.
   Motorola's report yesterday on April orders for
semiconductors and other electronic equipment was greeted
with cheers by analysts, according to the Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report. April orders were up sharply
from March, according to analysts who spoke with the company.
A spokesman for the company said that Motorola's
semiconductor business in particular was showing signs of
continued strength. Motorola gained 1 7/8 to 72 1/2 on nearly
one million shares.
   Investors jumped into other technology issues: Digital
Equipment gained 1/2 to 88 1/2 on 1.2 million shares, while
Compaq Computer rose 3/4 to 104 1/2.
   Terry Mogil, technology analyst at Chancellor Capital
Management, said the group may be due for some profit-taking
soon, however. "A good economy or new products can override"
a summer sell-off on technology shares, but it is not clear
that important products or strong economic growth will be
forthcoming, she said.
   John C. Maxwell III, technology analyst at Dillon Read,
said the technology group is benefiting from investors' focus
on earnings growth. "People are looking at the relative
earnings growth in these stocks compared with the S&amp;P 500 and
they look cheap," he said.
   Investors also bought consumer products shares. Procter &amp;
Gamble gained 1 1/2 to 75 and Colgate-Palmolive rose 1 1/8 to
59 1/4. Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing rose 1 1/8 to 80.
   The first leg of the Treasury's $30.5 billion refinancing
starts today, and many stock traders think rates could rise a
bit and cause some investors to sell stocks.
   "Breadth has improved but there are only a handful of
stocks that you can make money in," said Jack Solomon,
technical analyst at Bear Stearns. "After six days of run-up,
it's time for a pause."
   Despite the recent broadening of market strength, other
analysts also doubt that big stocks can sustain gains without
an accompanying advance in smaller stocks. Chester Pado,
director of technical research at Jefferies &amp; Co. in Los
Angeles, said it is likely that the industrial average and
other market barometers will fall back in line with the
broader market.
   "The pattern is almost always resolved by the averages
coming down, rather than the bulk of the market moving up,"
Mr. Pado said.
   But Heiko H. Thieme, consulting investment strategist for
Deutsche Bank and portfolio manager of the American Heritage
Fund, is more hopeful.
   If interest rates come down, which he says they should,
the broader market may very well catch up and even propel the
averages higher.
   Many observers hailed last week's report that employment
in April had grown less than expected, signaling some relief
from the inflationary pressures that have kept interest rates
high. The bond market rallied, and the apparent interest rate
relief sent stock prices climbing.
   But Mr. Pado remains unconvinced. There's no resolution
yet "as to whether we still have an inflationary battle on
our hands, or whether rates have peaked here," he said.
   National Semiconductor led the most active list, gaining
1/4 to 7 1/8 on volume of more than two million shares.
   Oil stocks ended mixed along with prices in the crude oil
futures market. Exxon closed unchanged at 46 1/2. Mobil was
up 1/2 to 60 1/4 and Chevron added 1/4 to 67 3/8, while
Texaco dropped 1/4 to 58 3/8. Exxon, along with Mobil and
Chevron, was forced to halt offshore Louisiana crude oil
production in some fields after a Texaco pipeline that serves
the fields was shut down because of a leak.
   Ames Department Stores slid another 3/8, to 2 5/8. Today,
Manhattan's Federal Bankruptcy Court will rule on Ames's
request for interim financing to keep the company operating
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   PepsiCo lost 3/8 to 67 7/8. TW Holdings, one of the
nation's largest food services companies and the largest
franchisee of Hardee's Food Systems, said it was dropping
Pepsi-Cola products from its 465 Hardee's restaurants but
will continue providing Coca-Cola, according to Investor's
Daily. The blow to Pepsi comes days after Burger King dumped
Pepsi for Coke, after more than six years. Coca-Cola Co.
added 1/2 to 78 3/4.
   Symbol Technologies rose 1/4 to 9, adding to Friday's
3/4-point gain. On Friday, the company said a federal court
had upheld Symbol's basic patents on hand-held laser scanners
for reading bar codes. The court ruled that the Japanese unit
of a closely held American concern, Opticon, had infringed on
the patents. Symbol is coming off a 52-week low of 6 5/8.
   General Motors edged up 1/2 to 46 1/4. The company
received a favorable mention from Dean Witter Reynolds mutual
fund manager Paul Vance, who picked GM as his favorite stock.
Meanwhile, GM's Canadian unit said its joint venture with
Japan's Suzuki Motor will double production of its subcompact
passenger cars.
   Rorer Group fell 1 5/8 to 63 1/8. Rhone-Poulenc said it
successfully completed its tender offer for Rorer by
accepting 21.6 million shares for payment on a pro rata basis
at $78 a share. The proration factor is about 51%, Rorer
said.
   Munsingwear eased 1/8 to 1 7/8. A shareholder has filed
suit to block Irwin Jacobs's offer to buy 80% of Munsingwear
for $2 a share.
   Media companies fared well. Time Warner added 5/8 to 94
1/2, Capital Cities/ABC advanced 3 to 562 and CBS gained 1 to
183 3/4.
   IMO Industries surged 2 1/2 to 18. Late Friday, the
company said a federal court had ordered a "substantial"
reduction in the amount of damages claimed against IMO by
Long Island Lighting. Before the order, Lilco's claim for
damages amounted to $271 million.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.60
to 347.33. Volume totaled 11,770,000 shares.

   HOBART, Australia -- Australian businessman Edmund
Alexander Rouse, former chairman of the ENT Ltd. media group,
which owns radio stations in California, was jailed for three
years for offering a bribe to a politician.
   Mr. Rouse was also fined 4,000 Australian dollars
(US$3,022) for the bribe offer, which was made to a Tasmanian
state politician.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Rouse had pleaded guilty to one charge of offering a
bribe to a politician in June last year, and another count of
improperly using his position as an officer of ENT. He
resigned as chairman of ENT last June, after he was charged
with the bribery offense.
   In sentencing Mr. Rouse, the court said he had tried to
nullify the democratic process by offering A$110,000 to an
Australian Labor Party politician to cross the floor of
Parliament and vote with the Liberal Party on a key issue.
   The move was aimed at saving the Liberal State government,
which was then ruling Tasmania with a minority government,
and to protect Mr. Rouse's business interests.
   In addition to the seven California radio stations, ENT
also owns three Australian television stations and the
Launceston Examiner daily newspaper, and has interests in
motels and cinemas in Australia.

   The Help-Wanted Advertising Index, a seasonally adjusted

   First-quarter economic activity was strong enough to stop
a further decline. Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board

   Ad volume, measured in 51 major U.S. newspapers, declined
in six of the nine major regions of the country. The West
North Central region recorded the steepest drop -- 11%. And
the East South Central and East North Central regions showed
increases of 4.5% and 2.5% respectively. Mr. Goldstein said,
"Hardest hit areas continued to show improvements, although
at an anxiety-inducing slow pace."

   Yanks Stay Home for Seville World's Fair in 1992

   We will do anything to help our country compete out there
in the cold, cruel world except read about it. Whenever our
line of sight intersects reading material entitled "U.S.
Competitiveness in the Changing Global Economy" or anything
close, our eyelids slam shut.
   This, in fact, was exactly what was happening the other
afternoon, and we would have been deep into Z-Land had
someone not dropped on our desk in the nick of time a
quarterly but riveting publication entitled "World's Fair."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We immediately perked up because world's fairs always
remind us of Elvis. This is because the closest we ever got
to Elvis was at the Seattle World's Fair in the summer of
1962.
   Technically, it was called the Century 21 Exposition, with
exhibits from 48 countries, 9.7 million visitors and a
607-foot Space Needle. It was a Category B, or single-theme,
exposition, and we hitchhiked all the way across the country
with our friend Andy to get to it, carefully plotting our
route west and back so that we might set a record for college
freshmen setting foot in the most states in a single,
thumb-propelled summer expedition.
   Anyway, by the time we got to Seattle, it was late August
and Elvis's tracks were all over the place. He had been there
making a movie called "It Happened at the World's Fair." We
forgot exactly what happened, but we remember what that fair
proved. It proved that the U.S.A. was THE BEST. Castro had
Cuba, but we had Elvis and a Space Needle and we were the
world's Numero Uno.
   The other thing world's fairs remind us of is lying. This
is because the only other world's fair we've visited was Expo
'74 in Spokane, Wash., 289 miles east of Seattle. This was a
mini-fair, with exhibits from 11 nations and 37 corporations,
and a theme of "celebrating tomorrow's fresh, new
environment," which the organizers symbolized by dumping
exactly 1,974 foot-long rainbow trout into the Spokane River,
and which demonstrators saluted with a placard that read,
"Clean Up Our Environment, Impeach Nixon."
   The biggest exhibits in Spokane were from the governments
of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and they lied through their
teeth about pollution. The Soviets said, essentially, that
good socialists don't pollute, and they didn't have any
pollution. The U.S., at least, was honest enough to say it
had some.
   The U.S. pavilion contained, among other things, a huge
pile of junk. Once again, we got the message: The U.S. was
BEST, No. 1, although we admit spending less time near the
junk pile than around the pretty girls at the Philippines
pavilion's chicken adobo concession.
   Anyway, from our experience and study over the years we
have concluded, more or less, that world's fairs are
gatherings at which various nations strut their stuff and
then the good old U.S.A. walks away with the blue ribbon.
That's what happened at the first world's fair, the Crystal
Palace Exhibition of 1851 in London, and at the 1893
Columbian Exposition in Chicago. And on and on. It somehow
didn't seem, well, fair.
   So you can imagine how our eyelids popped open at seeing
World's Fair quarterly's front-page headline: "A Major
Embarrassment in the Making: Congress Refuses Money for US
Pavilion in Seville."
   Seville Expo '92 isn't going to be some rinky-dink
sideshow in the tacky, long-queued manner of financially
burdened Knoxville '82, or stealing-burdened New Orleans '84.
Seville is going to be a HUMONGOUS MOTHER. This is the fair
that celebrates the end of the Cold War, the coronation of
the European Community, the 500th Anniversary of Columbus's
discovery of America, and Spain's emergence as a modern
democracy. The organizers expect 103 nations to build
pavilions and 30 million to 40 million people to visit. The
1992 Summer Olympic Games will be going on in nearby
Barcelona, bikinis will be swarming the beaches at the nearby
Costa del Sol, and a Disneyland is opening in nearby France.
   Seville in the summer of 1992 is going to be the center of
the universe, and the United States of America has the grace,
maturity and generosity to stay home for a change and let
somebody else have the limelight.
   We had to find out why, so we phoned Alfred Heller, the
editor of World's Fair who lives in Corte Madera, Calif.,
which is in Marin County. He's a world's fair hardliner.
   "It all seems inconsequential and almost amusing now," he
told us. "But come 1992, and here is a major world event,
with more nations participating than ever before, during the
year of Europe when, perhaps, a good number of Eastern
Europeans could be traveling to the west for the first time,
and here is THE GREAT DEMOCRACY too preoccupied to
participate. It seems odd that we don't have a sense of our
own worth and importance to put ourselves forward at a great
gathering at a propitious time."
   But hey, we thought, just because we don't play doesn't
mean we've turned into a Couch Potato Country. We aren't
preoccupied, we're just being nice.
   But that's not what Marvin Stone told us. We called him up
in our nearby nation's capital because he is commissioner
general for the U.S. pavilion, which is part of the U.S.
Exhibits Service of the U.S. Information Agency.
   "We're potentially saying that our competitive spirit is
dying," he said, using the dreaded "C" word. He told us that
the seed money keeping the pavilion's architects busy runs
out this month, that the U.S. effort is about four months
behind, that he needs $14.5 million from Congress and an
additional $30 million from private enterprise and the
states, which are hesitant to kick in until Uncle Sam antes.
But Congress won't cough up the dough.
   You wanna know why, don't you? Well, we'll tell you why.
   Laos.
   That's right. Congress got extremely agitated when it
found out a while back that the USIA was stopping Voice of
America broadcasts in Laotian in order to save $2.9 million
to get the U.S. pavilion for Seville started. And we can
understand why. Relations between the U.S. and Laos are far
too sensitive these days for us to be turning off VOA
broadcasts and risk offending Laos. We could see people all
over Laos, people who absolutely cannot live without a daily
fix of Randy Travis and Ricky Skaggs on VOA, getting deeply
offended. Congress could rightly assume it would be flooded
with letters from distraught Laotians, and listeners in five
other languages -- Slovenian, Uzbek, Swahili, Greek and
Turkish -- the USIA also wanted to drop. Congress said no
way.
   Actually it was two courageous and frugal Democrats, Rep.
Neal Smith of Iowa and Sen. Ernest Hollings of South
Carolina, chairmen of the House and Senate subcommittees
responsible for what the world thinks of us, who are standing
up for the Laoses of the world and against those who want the
U.S. to hog all the glory in Seville. It's a lonely job, but
somebody's gotta do it.

   DETROIT -- An association of 260 Detroit-area car dealers
is launching a direct-mail weekly publication that will
compete with local newspapers and television for a slice of
the $75 million dealers spend advertising their stores.
   The Detroit Auto Dealers Association is betting that its
paper, called Auto Dealer Direct, will appeal to dealers
turned off by the sharp rise in rates that followed the
partial merger of Detroit's daily newspapers, Gannett Co.'s
Detroit News and Knight-Ridder Inc.'s Detroit Free Press, an
official of the association said yesterday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Auto Dealer Direct will be mailed to about 1.4 million
households in Detroit and the surrounding suburbs, starting
Saturday, May 12. The tabloid, planned at a minimum 12 pages
per issue, will feature a page of auto-related news, a weekly
sweepstakes contest, and at least two four-color pages. It
also will offer dealers the choice of seven zoned editions.
   Detroit's car dealers have pondered launching or buying
their own publication for several years, but decided to do it
after the partial merger late last year of the once hotly
competitive News and Free Press sent local ad rates "sky
high," said Carl Fischer, head of the dealer association's
"alternative media" committee. Mr. Fischer said Auto Dealer
Direct's zoned editions will offer dealers prices as low as
$1,300 a page for 200,000 households. A full-run, one-page ad
will cost about $9,000, he said, about $1,000 a page less
than the rates charged by the metro dailies.
   The Detroit dealer group has hired Troy, Mich.-based
Media, Marketing and Promotion Inc. to produce the paper.

   MCI Decides
   To Offer Payout
   Semiannually

   MCI Communications Corp., long opposed to paying any
dividend on its common stock, declared an initial semiannual
dividend of five cents a share.
   While nominal, the payout is aimed at attracting new
investors to the Washington-based long-distance company and
rewarding the patience of its current holders, said Daniel F.
Akerson, MCI's chief financial officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Many institutional investors can't hold the stock of a
company that doesn't pay a dividend," said Mr. Akerson. "This
will help widen our base" of ownership.
   Based on MCI's current stock price, the annualized payout
of 10 cents a share will represent a yield of about 0.25%. In
contrast, the per-share yield for archrival American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., one of the most widely held stocks
in the world, is $1.32 a year, or about 3.3%.
   At MCI, the dividend question has been a sensitive subject
since the company began trading publicly in 1972. MCI's
chairman and founder, William McGowan, has been opposed to
paying dividends because, in his view, they are taxed twice,
first as corporate profits and then as personal income.
   But since the company began to have positive cash flow in
the 1988 third quarter, Mr. Akerson said, MCI has been
seriously discussing the possibility of paying at least a
token amount to shareholders.
   The dividend declaration was viewed on Wall Street as a
further indication of MCI's maturity and strength. In
national over-the-counter trading, MCI closed at $38.25, up
37.5 cents a share. More than two million shares changed
hands, making MCI one of the most active issues.
   "The dividend shows that the company is confident enough
in its cash position not only to make acquisitions, but also
to pay a dividend," said Edward M. Greenberg, a
telecommunications analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Last
month, MCI signed a pact to acquire Telecom USA for about
$1.25 billion.
   MCI's Mr. Akerson said he expects the company to keep its
new semiannual payment at the current level for at least "two
or three years." He said MCI's free cash flow is strong
enough to support such an amount, but such recent
acquisitions as Telecom USA will probably prevent the company
from increasing the payout rate anytime soon. In 1989, MCI
had free cash flow of $225 million. The company said it
defines free cash flow as net income plus depreciation minus
capital expenditures.
   Once company executives "sort through the acquisitions,
and we make sure we're in good shape," Mr. Akerson said, "we
could decide to increase it (the dividend) or we could decide
to go quarterly."
   Joel Gross, a telecommunications analyst with Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said most investors
"don't want MCI to become a dividend company." He said he
thinks they would "rather see the company reinvest the cash
in futher growth and expansion."

   Feminism's Skewed Definition at Wellesley
   ----
   By Enola G. Aird

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A24
</SO>
<LP>
   The time has come for full-time mothers to go on the
offensive. That is the lesson of the student protest
(ironically, just in time for Mother's Day) against Barbara
Bush's invitation to speak at this year's Wellesley
commencement.
   The Wellesley protesters are angry for two reasons. First,
they believe that Mrs. Bush was invited only because her
husband is the president of the U.S. Second, they apparently
do not consider Mrs. Bush a suitable role model for young
women because she has not pursued a career of the sort to
which most Wellesley women no doubt aspire.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both of these are bad arguments. The first objection
assumes that because Barbara Bush's husband is more famous
than she is, she cannot be an interesting and important and
appealing person in her own right -- that she must be a mere
appendage. With the second objection, the Wellesley
protesters are endorsing the view that if a woman puts her
children first, she is all but wasting her life.
   I can attest that Wellesley women are not alone in their
disdain for women who choose to care for their children
full-time. I am the product of an exclusive and expensive
education -- Barnard College and Yale Law School -- and I
have done my time in the practice of law. My husband is a law
professor, and we have two children. For the past three
years, I have chosen to devote all my time to the care of our
children and community service.
   At gatherings of professionals, the flow of conversation
seems directed around rather than toward women who make the
choice that I have. Their husbands are evidently fascinating
people -- they have "real" careers -- but those women who
devote their time to their children are all too often met
with little more than an "Oh, that's nice."
   And yet, when my husband took a semester and a summer to
be at home full time with our first child, his decision was
greeted with admiration and respect. His time was not being
wasted; he was not boring. It was oh, so wonderful, this man
at home with a child in the Connecticut suburbs while his
wife commuted to New York to pursue her career. And as I
think about the Wellesley protest, I cannot help wondering
whether a man who made the choice to stay at home and care
for his children would be acceptable to Wellesley students as
a graduation speaker.
   I suspect that he would, and if I am right, then the
Wellesley protest amounts to discrimination against women by
women. Only men are to be free to make the lifestyle choice
to stay at home and raise children without being criticized,
trivialized and marginalized. If women do it, they are poor
role models who are betraying the forces of progress.
   This says little that is good about the Wellesley
students' understanding of feminism, an ideology I had always
thought was supposed to enhance women's choices. It says even
less that is good about the value that some future leaders of
America who happen to be women place on child care as an
activity and on children themselves.
   According to the Wellesley protesters, caring for children
is not an important enough endeavor for those of us who have
had the best education money can buy to spend much time on
it. Our talents are not appreciated or valued unless we apply
them outside of the home.
   But no one deserves the benefits of our talents more than
our children do. It is our job to be forceful advocates for
our children and for our right to care for them free from
pressure to conform to someone else's vision of how women
ought to do.
   Like most college seniors about to embark on a journey
through real life, the Wellesley protesters have a lot to
learn. Mrs. Bush could teach them something about the dignity
that can come from being comfortable with one's self and the
choices that one makes. In time the students will learn even
more than that: that there can be value in giving and that
there is great value in working for children. The Wellesley
protest shows little respect for those of us who have made
and acted on the free and open decision that nothing is more
important to us than our children. And it is those children
finally that the Wellesley protest devalues.

   Chrysler Corp. is recalling about 383,700 of its
1985-model cars because they fail to meet federal
auto-exhaust standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide,
the Environmental Protection Agency announced in Washington.
   The company agreed to the recall after the EPA discovered
the problem during routine testing. The affected models are
the Plymouth Horizon, Turismo, Reliant and Reliant wagon; and
the Dodge Omni, Charger, Aries and Aries wagon. All have
2.2-liter engines.
</LP>

   Chrysler will replace part of the carburetor choke system.
The service will be free for car owners.
   Hydrocarbons contribute to the formation of smog when
combined with sunlight and other pollutants. Excessive carbon
monoxide impairs heart function and is harmful to people with
lung disease and anemia.

   STOCKHOLM -- Bain &amp; Co. agreed to join a leveraged buy-out
of Swedish management consultant Indevo AB and gained an
option to take full control later this year in a transaction
valued at 300 million Swedish kronor ($49.4 million).
   A Bain official said that, if completed, the Indevo
acquisition would be the Boston-based management consultant's
biggest to date. Bain currently lacks permanent
representation in Scandinavia. But swallowing Indevo, which
claims to be Sweden's biggest management consultant, would
bring the U.S. concern a 20% share of an estimated 1.2
billion kronor market, expanding at a rate of nearly 40% a
year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bain expects the local connection to increase its clout
with Sweden's big international companies. But Indevo also
has been involved in the restructuring of Sweden's
state-owned railways and national postal service. Some
industry analysts think urgently needed reform of the
sprawling public sector will become a major source of new
business for management consultants in coming years.
   Peter Toernqvist, a Munich-based Bain director, said the
U.S. firm has handled assignments from Swedish corporate
clients for several years, but always on a one-time basis.
"We've lacked staying power, a disadvantage when you don't
have your own representation," he said.

   If They Are Not Under the Collar,
   Workers Are Buttoning Their Lips

   Inspired by events in Eastern Europe, Jack Hepfer decided
to make a radical suggestion at Safeco Corp.'s annual
meeting.
   Mr. Hepfer, a lawyer who recently retired after 28 years
with the Seattle insurance concern, proposed that the company
do away with its rule requiring male employees to wear white
shirts every day.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The Berlin Wall has come down," he says. "In time, maybe
this wall will come down, too."
   The call for change came after Mr. Hepfer did some
research on Safeco's founder, H.K. Dent. He found that while
Mr. Dent cautioned salesmen in the 1950s that flashy duds
might "distract a prospect's attention from a sales talk . .
. he felt there's nothing the matter with colored shirts."
   The shirt issue "wasn't on my mind 24 hours a day," when
he worked at Safeco, Mr. Hepfer says, but it bothered him
that "outsiders scoff a little at the damn uniform." He also
believes the policy is sexist. "I'm not looking for an ACLU
case, but a woman can wear blouses of any color she wants."
   The crowd at last week's annual meeting met Mr. Hepfer's
suggestion with applause and laughter. "The place was
rolling," says spokeswoman Pat Hillis. But the suggestion
wasn't embraced by Safeco's chief executive officer, Bruce
Maines, who said the code was part of the corporate culture.
He said he owns 35 white shirts.
   "We wouldn't want to throw out a 60-year tradition," says
Ms. Hillis, adding that the company regards the policy "as a
badge of honor." For years, she says, students at the nearby
University of Washington "have referred to us as `the
shirts.'"
   Safeco, which employs about 5,300, requires all its male
white-collar workers to be just that. Clerical employees have
a less stringent dress code. Women can wear different hues as
long as their attire is "professional." During the energy
crunch of the 1970s, when thermostats were turned down, the
company liberalized its dress code to allow women to wear
slacks to the office.
   Men can express their fashion flair with "conservative
ties in good taste," and mavericks can even don summer
weight, light blue suits. In addition, "we have absolutely no
objection to striped shirts," says Ms. Hillis, "as long as
they're white on white."

   Poland's Biggest Factory Struggles to Survive

<LP>
   WARSAW -- Henryk Poddany is anxiously gazing out his
window at a parking lot full of tractors. Where, he wonders,
can he sell 1,500 tractors quickly? Mr. Poddany (pronounced
Poh-DAH-nee) is the managing director of the Foreign Trade
Office for Ursus, the Polish tractor company. Mr. Poddany
knows that understanding the market in the next few months
will be critical to his company's future.
   For 45 years, Ursus sold tractors mainly within the
protected Polish market. On Jan. 1, however, the Polish
government withdrew virtually all protection. It converted
Poland into a free market country with the stroke of a pen.
Ursus, though still state-owned, is suddenly operating on its
own, without subsidies or other government assistance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The challenge to Ursus goes beyond the overnight
transition to capitalism; Poland is also suffering from a
drastic recession, the consequence of the rapid shift to
world market prices. The problems Ursus's management faces
are representative of those of every company in the country.
Ursus is carrying $20 million in short-term debt. It had
hoped to finance its debt through sales, but the recession
has depressed revenue. Tractor exports are up 80% over 1989
levels but from a small base. Ursus cannot afford to
refinance through Polish banks because interest rates are
currently 8% a month (down from 35% a month in January). A
bank loan with a grace period is not likely to be available,
nor is the Polish government going to intervene.
   Ursus is hoping to sell its accumulated inventory to a
foreign buyer. The company's stockpile of finished goods and
raw materials is probably worth more than $20 million. "In
the past, we carried large inventory because vendors were
unreliable and interest rates were low," says Stanislaw
Barczewski, the company's deputy director of technical
development. "Since January we've been able to buy most of
our raw materials on short notice. But we were not prepared
to cut the accumulated inventories so quickly."
   Ursus could also sell equity, perhaps through a joint
venture with foreigners -- several Western companies have
already approached Ursus. Alternatively, Ursus could sell
shares domestically. Management and workers alike are
interested in privatizing the company. Privatizing such a
large company, however, would require months, because of the
need to recast financial statements according to world-wide
standards, to value the company and to build a secondary
market for shares in Poland.
   Once management has found the cash to continue operating,
it will have to focus immediately on other problems. The
company has two main possibilities: to focus on making
complete tractors or to emphasize components.
   Mr. Poddany believes that in the domestic market, Ursus
can continue to sell whole tractors. "Our products are
well-suited for this market, and our prices are unbeatable.
Also, we are the only company with any infrastructure in
Poland." But in the near term, Ursus must sell outside
Poland, where people have money to buy its products. And that
may mean selling components, instead of whole tractors:
"Tractor dealers do not buy from many manufacturers and they
rarely change suppliers," Mr. Poddany says. "Because we are
new to the market, foreign dealers might consider us risky,
despite a discount of about 25% relative to imports from
Japan and Korea."
   So Ursus has to sell itself before selling its parts.
"Foreign companies need to know that we have good equipment,
years of manufacturing experience including some exports, and
average wages of 60 cents per hour, including benefits and
payroll taxes," says Aleksander Burnowicz, Ursus's commercial
director. Exports of components are up 300% over last year's
levels.
   Low wages, however, are not enough to make Ursus
competitive. "We don't know our costs by product," says Lech
Kuczmowski, one of the company's systems analysts. "Our
standard costs are obsolete. We've continued many operations
over the years because we couldn't rely on outside vendors in
the communist system. We are sure to be uneconomical in some
areas."
   Financial accounting is probably the weakest functional
area at Ursus. Historical financial statements are almost
irrelevant since they do not contain market prices and they
incorporate large subsidies. Finance personnel have
historically occupied themselves with the management of a
steady and predictable flow of money.
   Ursus might focus its cost-reduction efforts on materials.
Materials account for 70% to 80% of total cost in most Polish
manufacturing companies. Labor and benefits typically
represent less than 10%. Ursus believes it can reduce
material costs through better purchasing, for example by
importing some inputs. Unfortunately, the company does not
have a world-wide supplier list. "How could we have one?"
asks Mr. Kuczmowski. "Until three months ago we had almost no
dollars with which to import."
   Ursus may also be able to use materials more efficiently:
"We inspect raw materials," Mr. Kuczmowski explains, "but
generally we don't send rejects back to the vendors. This
practice is a legacy of the communist era when the most
difficult aspect of manufacturing was getting inputs."
   The prospect of making all these changes quickly is a bit
daunting. Not surprisingly, Ursus management is interested in
collaborating with foreign partners soon. The Ursus parking
lot continues to fill up with tractors intended for the
domestic market. Management has decided it will temporarily
halt production for the domestic market if local sales do not
pick up soon. Only workers producing for export would stay on
the payroll.
   Similar problems confront virtually all of Poland's 8,000
state-owned enterprises. There is an urgent and widespread
need to make business connections outside the East bloc and
to reshape Polish companies accordingly. Finance Minister
Lescek Balcerowicz, in Washington today for talks with the
State Department, is acutely aware of the need for real
restructuring at the factory level. He has made it a top
priority to see that Polish companies learn Western
managerial procedures and get information about prospective
customers, suppliers, and partners outside Poland. The easy
way out -- subsidies and easy credit -- is not regarded as a
solution.

   HONG KONG -- Overseas Trust Bank, which was declared
insolvent and taken over by the government in 1985, settled a
negligence claim against accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
the bank's auditor until the takeover.
   Overseas Trust alleged that Coopers &amp; Lybrand failed to
audit the bank's accounts properly, and therefore should take
at least some responsibility for the losses that caused the
insolvency and subsequent takeover.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The settlement, announced Monday, involves a payment by
Coopers &amp; Lybrand to the bank, which remains under government
management. The amount of the payment wasn't disclosed.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, one of the world's largest accounting
firms, isn't required to admit liability.
   Overseas Trust Managing Director David Turner said the
bank considers the payment a satisfactory settlement of the
lawsuit, which he described as "basically a negligence
action."
   Roderick Chalmers, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said
the firm continues to maintain its "denial of the
allegations" in the lawsuit as well as its "denial of
liability." In New York, Coopers &amp; Lybrand's in-house lawyers
weren't available for comment.
   After the government takeover, Overseas Trust announced a
consolidated loss totaling HK$3.05 billion (US$391.4
million), for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1985. Subsequent
police investigations led to fraud convictions and prison
terms for several senior bank executives and their business
associates.
   Coopers &amp; Lybrand wasn't implicated in the criminal
investigation.

   Chicago Futures Pit Trader Goes to Trial

   Government Faces
   Crucial First Case

   CHICAGO -- Robert Mosky had a bad habit while working as a
futures trader in the Swiss franc pit at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange: He liked to boast about his big trades.
   While not a crime itself, that flaw may land Mr. Mosky in
jail. His bravado was secretly tape-recorded by an undercover
federal agent posing as a futures trader in 1988. And some of
it allegedly is incriminating.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The tapes will be a central feature in the first trial in
the government's broad probe of the Chicago futures pits. The
trial is scheduled to begin today in federal court here.
   The government charges that the 34-year-old Mr. Mosky and
two other traders, Danny Scheck and David Zatz, "regularly"
stole thousands of dollars worth of customer trading profits
in the Merc's Swiss franc futures trading pit.
   This trial will provide the first detailed look at the
government's top-secret sting operation in the trading pits
of the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade. It may also
hasten calls for reform of futures trading regulations if, as
expected, prosecutors paint a picture of dishonest traders
rarely being detected or punished by the exchanges.
   "If the government allegations are true and the tapes are
representative of exchange activity, we have a serious
problem" with futures industry regulation, said G. Robert
Blakey, a University of Notre Dame law professor.
   Following a two-year undercover operation on the floors of
Chicago's free-wheeling markets, the government last year
charged 47 traders and a clerk with a variety of infractions
that allegedly looted profits from their customers. Two more
trials of indicted traders, one group from the Merc's
Japanese yen futures trading pit and another from the Board
of Trade's soybean futures pit, are scheduled for September.
   For the embattled futures industry, Mr. Mosky's trial
comes at a bad time. Guilty verdicts would provide
high-powered ammunition for the futures industry's Washington
critics, including Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and
Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, who in recent months have advocated steps that
would tighten regulation of the futures markets.
   Says Congressman Edward Markey (D., Mass.), an advocate of
financial market reform: "To the extent that these trials
graphically portray the failures in the surveillance and
enforcement record of our regulators, the need for the
strongest possible unified regulatory scheme will be
reinforced."
   The futures exchanges say that the indicted traders
represent only a small fraction of the few thousand members
of each exchange who collectively make millions of legitimate
trades each year. The exchanges also toughened certain
trading rules following the indictments.
   Defense attorneys for the traders contend their clients
are innocent, and that the indictments reflect the
government's ignorance of the inner workings of the futures
markets. The attorneys say they will argue that the
government's undercover agent often didn't understand what
was going on in the frenetic atmosphere of the trading pit.
The attorneys also are likely to assert that many of the
allegedly fraudulent trades are examples of widespread -- and
unpunished -- bending of exchange rules practiced by traders
in most Merc pits to help each other execute orders in the
often frantic trading atmosphere.
   But that may be a difficult sell. If, as the government
alleges, "brokers were avoiding liability for errors by
getting another trader to bail them out, and they were taking
money away from customers, that falls within the traditional
ballpark of fraud," says John Coffee, a Columbia University
law professor.
   The first trial is critical because the government would
like to use a guilty verdict to pressure other traders it has
indicted. These traders could then provide evidence against
still others to garner more guilty verdicts.
   There is continued pressure on the government to broaden
its case and win more indictments. Grand jury indictments
against 48 individuals doesn't justify a probe of the trading
pits that cost millions of dollars and already has done
substantial damage to the reputation of the exchanges and
their members, critics of the investigation claim.
   Sixteen individuals, including two Swiss franc traders,
William Walsh and Mark Fuhrman, have already pleaded guilty
and will provide evidence against defendants during the
trials.
   Justice Department procedures are also on trial in this
case. The government was harshly criticized last year for
charging several traders, including Mr. Mosky, with
racketeering -- a charge usually reserved for organized crime
figures. If traders are found guilty under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, statute, they
could forfeit hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets and
trading profits, as well as face stiff jail terms.
   Bob Mosky wasn't worried about tape recorders or
racketeering laws two years ago. The Chicago native, who
declined to be interviewed for this story, was having his
best year ever in the pits. By the end of 1988, the
studious-looking accounting major would make roughly $300,000
as a broker buying and selling Swiss franc futures for what
were then some of the biggest "houses" in the futures
business: Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Refco Group Ltd. and
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., among others.
   Traders say Mr. Mosky didn't let the money go to his head.
While other pit denizens quickly traded up to condominiums
overlooking Lake Michigan and imported sports cars, Mr.
Mosky, his wife and two children lived in a three-story house
on a quiet street. He drove a Mercury Sable, his wife drove a
Chrysler. Mr. Mosky was also quick to lend a clerk $20 until
his next paycheck arrived, and give generously to charities,
traders said.
   But his crowing about winning trades apparently attracted
the attention of undercover FBI agent Randall Jannett. For
most of 1988 the agent posed as a "local" trader -- or one
who traded for himself and didn't handle customer orders --
named Randy Jackson in the Swiss franc pit.
   The government alleges in court filings that the Swiss
franc traders conspired to help each other stay in business
at the expense of customers: "Mosky, Walsh and other brokers
regularly solicited accommodating local traders {including
Zatz, Scheck, Fuhrman, undercover agent Jannett and others}
to absorb losses caused by order-filling errors, or
outtrades, and repaid such locals through the illegal
manipulation of other customer orders in their possession."
   By February 1988, Agent Jannett was frequently trading
with Mr. Mosky and stood near him in the octagonal trading
pit. Close by stood Messrs. Scheck and Zatz, who are charged
with 20 or fewer fraud counts and violations of commodity
trading laws each compared with Mr. Mosky's RICO conspiracy
charge and 78 charges of fraud and violating federal
commodity trading laws.
   On Feb. 16 Agent Jannett bought an extra contract from Mr.
Mosky to help him complete a customer's sell order, according
to a document filed to support the government's conspiracy
allegations. To repay the favor, Mr. Mosky sold the agent
nine contracts belonging to a customer at a price lower than
that prevailing in the pit at the time, the document says.
The trade essentially guaranteed that the agent would make a
profit by reselling the contracts at the higher market price,
and then pocketing the difference that should have gone to
the customer.
   "Good things happen to those who help out," Mr. Mosky told
the agent, according to the government document, which
doesn't specify when the agent tape-recorded conversations
and when he wrote them down later in his daily reports.
   Two months later Mr. Mosky bought Swiss franc futures from
an unnamed trader at a price above the market price,
effectively overcharging his customer. Then he told the
trader, "ain't I a nice guy," the document said.
   The government says it has numerous other examples of
fraudulent trades made by Mr. Mosky either with Agent
Jannett, or observed by him or the two cooperating traders.
   Since he was indicted last August, Mr. Mosky has been
trading as a marked man on the Merc floor. He has complied
with exchange requests that indicted brokers not handle
customer orders. Instead, he has been trading for his own
account to make ends meet.
   Sentiment on the Merc floor runs strongly in favor of the
indicted Swiss franc traders, who are seen as victims of a
federal witch hunt. Many traders, while aware that the
government and the Merc may be watching their every move
(there may still be government undercover agents on the
floor), have tried to help Mr. Mosky.
   "The guys have been taking care of him. They have been
feeding him trades when they could," said a currency futures
trader.

   Enimont S.p.A. reported 1989 net profit fell 21% to 750
billion lire ($614 million) from pro-forma net earnings of
945 billion lire in 1988. The profit figure was down
significantly from a forecast by former Chairman Lorenzo
Necci in January that the chemical venture, based in Milan,
Italy, would post net profit of 900 billion lire last year.
   Enimont also predicted net profit in 1990 would be around
450 billion lire, down sharply from Mr. Necci's 1988
prediction that the company would post earnings of 1.2
trillion lire in 1990.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Enimont was formed at the beginning of 1989 by merging the
chemical interests of state energy agency Ente Nazionale
Idrocarburi and private chemical group Montedison S.p.A.
   Hailed as a model of public-private cooperation, Enimont's
profitability has been badly damaged by fighting between the
two founders over strategy and investments, analysts agree. A
cyclical downturn in the chemical industry has also kept
pressure on earnings, experts said.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Opera:
   Twilight of the Diva

   New York -- At "Siegfried" the other night, a man
diagonally in front of me slept so soundly I thought he was
dead. In fact, wondering about him probably helped keep me
wide awake through some of the most boring vocal music Wagner
ever wrote. But then the man stirred to life, about the same
time Fafner the dragon did, and sounding much the same. So
there was no reason to rush him over to Roosevelt Hospital --
conveniently around the corner from the Metropolitan Opera --
where patrons and singers sometimes end up.
   Hildegard Behrens, for instance, was wheeled there the
other night after a foam beam landed on her head at the end
of "Gotterdammerung," the last opera in the "Ring" cycle,
when the world of the decadent gods is meant to disappear
(but not with the soprano). At the same time, another miscue
apparently opened up a hole in the floor through which the
soprano says she could have fallen fatally if the beam hadn't
decked her first.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There are many singers I wouldn't mind seeing disappear
down a dark hole, but Ms. Behrens, who canceled her remaining
performances, apparently more spooked than hurt, isn't
actually on the top of the list. Thin indeed are the ranks of
Wagnerian sopranos these days, strong ladies who must bellow
for hours over an orchestra of great size and volume. This is
particularly true at the Met, which had a fight with one of
the world's few other Valkyries worth her steed, Eva Marton.
She left the Met in a huff last year after learning the
company intended to telecast its "Ring" cycle with Ms.
Behrens. The Met didn't want Ms. Marton, not necessarily
because she is such a tiresome self-promoter, but because the
company's artistic chief, James Levine, has recorded the
"Ring" operas with Ms. Behrens for Deutsche Grammophon, which
is also planning to release video disks of the telecast.
Keeping the same soprano has an obvious sales advantage.
   DG and the Met must be pulling out each other's hair. Even
before the set collapsed on poor Ms. Behrens (Did anyone see
a thick-thewed Hungarian woman lurking in the wings?), the
soprano wasn't having the easiest time with Brunnhilde. "Die
Walkure" was already videotaped last year. But it was from
the three "Ring" cycles at the end of this season that the
Met expected to tape the remaining operas, ("Rheingold,"
"Siegfried," "Gotterdammerung") for the telecast starting
June 18 on the Public Broadcasting Service.
   Unfortunately, Ms. Behrens came down with a cold during
the first cycle's "Gotterdammerung" and didn't get much
better for the second go-around. Were it not for the
soprano's appealing stage persona, much of her singing would
have been unendurable. Neither did many of her companions
take our mind off the catastrophic scarcity of true
Wagnerians in the world.
   When an international company like the Met does the
"Ring," much can be learned about the current state of
Wagnerian singing. It was dispiriting to see Fricka and
Waltraute assigned to the faded mezzo of Christa Ludwig, who
made her debut in 1946. And it was equally sad to realize
that we are still looking for someone to fill Wolfgang
Windgassen's Size 15 heldentenor shoes.
   The Met and DG put their money on a real-life Siegfried --
Siegfried Jerusalem, suitably handsome as the fearless hero,
but also afflicted by a mundane cold for the first
"Gotterdammerung." Elsewhere, he revealed a lyrical, mellow
middle range that turned hoarse under pressure. In the
"Siegfried" duet with Ms. Behrens, one wondered who might
collapse sooner, because at that point we weren't yet also
worrying about the set. Much magic will have to be worked in
the studios.
   Neither is the pleasantly reedy-voiced Gary Lakes the
answer to fading heldentenor hopes, though one could at least
believe this Siegmund was the long lost brother of the
Sieglinde, Jessye Norman. When these jumbo-sized lovers
hunkered down over their pitiful little porridge bowls in
Hunding's hut, it looked like a meeting of the charter
members of the Moscow clean-plate club. Did she sing well?
Yes, in a mature manner rather at odds with the youthful
character who should seem to blossom forth with hope and love
just like the spring she sings about in the eternal first
act. Ms. Norman was autumnal.
   At least there is no world shortage of basses and
baritones, to judge from the satisfying profusion of
dark-voiced dwarfs, giants and gods, scuttling, stomping and
striding through this dully traditional production. Ekkehard
Wlaschiha was a memorably twisted Alberich; Matti Salminen, a
frighteningly intense Hagen.
   Most impressive was James Morris, who has become a Wotan
of searing vocal power and eloquence. As never before, he was
completely riveting in his faceted portrayal of the
overreaching empire-builder, brought down and shattered to
the core. Nearly as commanding in the pit (nearly as visible
too standing on an elevator-shoe of a podium) was Mr. Levine.
He's no Speedy Gonzalez, but his highly emotional approach to
the climactic scenes rarely failed to make an impact. Still,
couldn't the Met music chief arrange for some better
Valkyries? They were a screamy bunch. Why didn't a
foam-covered little boulder fall on them?
   Well, that's it for the "Ring" until the 1992-93 season
when there will be a "wiedersehen, jawohl]", maybe with the
same cast unless there is a sudden boomlet in Brunnhildes and
Siegfrieds. Meanwhile, with all those expensive sets on its
hands, why doesn't the Met join the ecology movement and
recycle a few mountains and trees into a set for Alfredo
Catalani's "La Wally?" This alpine melodrama hasn't been
heard in the house since Emmy Destinn sang it there in 1909.
"Wally" never earned a place in any company's repertory,
though it has always had champions.
   Tebaldi recorded "Wally" with Mario del Monaco. Toscanini
cruelly named a daughter after the mysterious,
mountain-climbing, edelweiss-in-the-hair heroine. Worse,
either the opera or the play it is based on, Wilhelmine von
Hillern's "Vulture Wally," inspired admiration even in the
distant Baltic burg of Riga because I got stuck with it as a
middle name.
   For all that, the opera is rather enjoyable, and it
received an enthusiastic performance from Eve Queler and her
Opera Orchestra at Carnegie Hall last month. With its
atmospheric preludes and bittersweet tunes, "Wally" has more
to offer than the well-known aria that floated through the
French movie hit "Diva," where it was sung by an enigmatic
soprano who performs in public but refuses to make
recordings.
   I wish the reverse were true of Aprile Millo who sang
Wally with a radiant, expressive voice and her usual diva
mannerisms ineptly borrowed from Tebaldi who was at least a
foot taller and never styled her hair by putting her finger
in a socket. Ms. Millo's next evening dress should be a
sequined straightjacket with hood attached.
   The rest of the cast was quite fine, particularly Kristjan
Johannsson, an Icelandic tenor, who revealed a thrillingly
heroic, cutting voice before he was silenced by an avalanche.
Say, del Monaco tried some Wagner late in life. Maybe Mr.
Johannsson could do the world a favor and learn the "Ring"
cycle.

   BONN -- New orders to the West German manufacturing
industry rose a seasonally adjusted 2.9% in March from
February and were up 3.5% from a year earlier, the Bonn
Economics Ministry said in a preliminary report.
   The rise reflected a sharp 10.5% month-to-month increase
in foreign orders, which resulted from a few large orders
obtained by the nation's aerospace industry, the ministry
said. Domestic orders dropped 1.5% during the month.

   Education:
   Businesses Link
   High School
   Grades to Jobs

   Businesses and schools are teaming up to teach students a
lesson: Good grades and good jobs go together.
   The growing efforts are designed primarily to motivate
students who aren't headed for college. They range from
paying more attention to high school grade transcripts to
promising jobs to students who demonstrate competence in
courses that teach skills employers need.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We have got a pretty good system for moving from school
to college, but we don't have a good transition from school
to work," says Bill Honig, California's Superintendent of
Public Instruction. In contrast to colleges, employers rarely
look at the records of high school graduates going directly
into the work force. For these students, "there's no reason
to work hard," Mr. Honig says.
   As a result, many employers complain they have a hard time
finding enough workers with adequate skills for entry-level
jobs that require the use of computers, writing or elementary
math. Jere Jacobs, an assistant vice president at Pacific
Telesis Group, says that only 40% of the 6,500 annual
applicants for entry-level jobs such as telephone operators
can pass "an employment test pegged to the junior high
level."
   The new school/business programs are aimed at changing
that. In Fort Worth, Texas, Superintendent of Schools Don
Roberts has established a business-dominated task force to
look at entry-level job requirements at such companies as
General Dynamics Corp., Tandy Corp., Pier 1 Imports Inc.,
American Airlines Inc. and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
"What do secretaries in your organization do?" Mr. Roberts
wants to know. "What level of word processing, math and
reading do they need?" Then the schools will review their
courses to make sure they're teaching the required skills.
   Mr. Roberts hopes that business will respond to the school
system's curricular review by promising jobs to students who
acquire the necessary skills. He also hopes that firms will
provide summer jobs and apprenticeship programs to reward
younger students who do well in school.
   California is trying to launch a number of pilot projects
with similar goals. "We want to be able to tell kids, `If you
achieve this level of performance, you'll get this kind of
job,'" Mr. Honig says.
   The efforts to link grades and jobs were triggered by John
Bishop, a professor at the School of Industrial and Labor
Relations at Cornell University. He observed that students
who aren't headed for college have little incentive to study
hard because businesses rarely look at their school records.
"The labor market fails to reward effort and achievement in
high school" with higher pay or better jobs, he wrote in an
article in Educational Researcher.
   Last year, Mr. Bishop's writing began to attract wide
attention in school circles. Mr. Honig in California, Albert
Shanker, the president of American Federation of Teachers,
and Scott Thomson, who was then executive director of the
National Association of Secondary School Principals, all
began echoing his theme that businesses were missing
opportunities to spur school performance.
   Another professor, James Rosenbaum of Northwestern
University, noted that one of the reasons Japanese students
work harder than Americans is that Japanese schools work
closely with businesses. The Japanese send the best students
to the best jobs, he said, whereas "Americans are suspicious
of linkages between public schools and employers." Of the
high school graduates in Japan who don't attend college,
almost all start working immediately after graduation, while
fewer than half the American students not headed for college
have jobs by the time they graduate.
   U.S. business groups are getting the message. The American
Business Conference has started to work on incentive programs
in California and elsewhere. "We're trying to develop a
system where business will start communicating to students
early on, perhaps in seventh or eighth grade, that if they're
exceptional students and meet the requirements, we're going
to reward them," says Peggy Murray, the director of ABC's
education task force.
   Working with ABC and the National Alliance of Business,
the Educational Testing Service has begun to develop a
project, called Worklink, to maintain computerized school,
test and work records that businesses could check when they
hire. Schools in Tampa, Fla., and business leaders in
Spokane, Wash., are looking at the program, which proponents
argue would give students incentives to boost their grades
and establish uniform rating standards.
   High school transcripts often are hard to understand
because course descriptions and grading patterns differ
widely. In addition, transcripts don't tell employers what
they want to know about work habits, reliability and social
skills.
   Schools are beginning to change that. In Colville, Wash.,
a town of 5,000 northeast of Spokane, transcripts report on
attendance, punctuality, ability to work in groups,
willingness to do more than the minimum required and other
factors. California is looking at ways to include similar
information in its transcripts.
   Any moves to make transcripts more useful -- both as
incentives to students and information for employers -- will
help students find better jobs. Currently, "one of the
saddest consequences of the lack of signals of achievement in
high school is that employers with good jobs offering
training and job security are unwilling to take the risk of
hiring a recent high school graduate," Mr. Bishop says.

   As a co-sponsor of the Clean Air bill, I believe that the
U.S. can establish reasonable domestic environmental
standards without being unreasonable about America's
competitiveness in the international marketplace.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There's no doubt that foreign producers operating under
less costly environmental standards will indirectly benefit
from the costs imposed on U.S. industry by the Clean Air
bill. I plan to offer an amendment that seeks to preserve a
level playing field by requiring the president to negotiate
equivalent environmental standards or trade adjustments with
our international competitors.
   Basically, this is neither an effort to protect our
interests only, nor is it a violation of the spirit of
fairness and reciprocity. I am attempting to put this issue
on the table now. Otherwise, it will haunt us later. Through
trade negotiations, the U.S. can promote an environmental
agenda that not only equalizes trade inequities at the
outset, but also enhances global responsibility in solving
our pollution problems.

   You neglected to mention one sector that should ultimately
benefit from more stringent emissions standards: the
nuclear-energy industry.
   According to the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness, for
every 1,000 megawatts of generating capacity, a coal-fired
utility will annually emit nearly 70,000 tons of sulfur
dioxide, 25,000 tons of nitrogen oxide and 1.6 million tons
of carbon dioxide. The corresponding figures for natural gas
are 17,000, 15,000 and 900,000 tons, respectively. Nuclear
utilities discharge none of these pollutants, nor do they
emit carbon monoxide or methane.

   In my opinion, you covered the legislation in an unfairly
negative light. You state the costs to industry as $21
billion, and remark that this exceeds the combined earnings
of several major corporations. However, a fairer comparison
would be with other costs of doing business. The sum of $21
billion, which you present as staggering, will be passed on
to consumers, and works out at less than $70 per capita, a
sum most of us would be happy to pay for clean air.
   It is also unfair to present this as some sort of trauma
to the economy. This money is not (so to speak) vanishing
into thin air. It is going into new sectors of the economy,
and represents an opportunity for new business and
technology. Clean air, and other environmental legislation,
is not a blow to the economy, but a shift in the economy,
something that occurs all the time for all sorts of reasons.
True, it will be bad for high-sulfur coal mining, and I for
one would be happy to pay for transitional compensation and
retraining for those affected. But we cannot refuse to make
important social transitions because they carry short-term
costs for certain sectors of the economy. Did anyone suggest
we shore up the horse-drawn buggy business because it was
threatened by the automobile?
   Clean technology is the wave of the future because clean
is the way people prefer to live. Custom is not good enough
reason for doing the wrong thing. In fact, the trouble with
the Clean Air Act is that it doesn't go nearly far enough.
If, instead of focusing on reducing tailpipe emissions, the
auto industry had chosen to boost fuel economy, something for
which ample technology already exists, we could have begun to
control not just ground-level air pollution but greenhouse
gases as well. It's time American business divorced itself
from the status quo and realized that the greatest benefits
will come from moving ahead.

   Acid rain is not, as your article suggests, some small,
isolated problem related only to the Northeast. Its effects
are being felt throughout the country (Mountain Lake, at an
elevation of 3,500 feet, in the western mountains of
Virginia, is acid-rain dead) and the world. We are not
talking about a minor problem for the 1990s. We are facing
our future.
   Industry will continue to drag its collective feet as long
as earnings per share govern performance. When will trustees
and stockholders wake up like most citizens and realize
higher costs are inevitable if we are to survive?

   Hanif Kureishi's first two produced screenplays, "My
Beautiful Laundrette" and "Sammy and Rosie Get Laid," brought
him wide attention as a perceptive chronicler of immigrant
life in London, the man who could portray what it was like to
be the object of "Paki-bashing," the great sport of England's
Skinheads.
   Not only are his movies messages about racism and life on
the underside of Thatcher's England, they also deal frankly
with sex -- both straight and homosexual.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I don't know when Mr. Kureishi began to write his first
novel "The Buddha of Suburbia" (Viking, 284 pages, $18.95)
but it is set in the 1970s and reads as though it was an
early treatment of his experiences as a young man of
non-English heritage growing up in Kent outside London.
Perhaps it was put aside in favor of the 1985 "Laundrette"
and 1987 "Sammy and Rosie."
   The novel covers the same terrain of racism, class
tensions and sex, but in more overtly autobiographical,
coming-of-age style. It is awkward and uncertain where the
films seemed confident.
   Like Mr. Kureishi's movies, "Buddha" has an array of
interesting characters and subplots, but without the dramatic
power of visual images, the novel seems rambling and
inconsequential.
   The Buddha of the title is an Indian immigrant working as
an insignificant clerk in Britain's civil service, commuting
quietly from the Kent suburb where he has installed his
English wife and two sons.
   As the novel opens, he is embarking on adultery with a
somewhat more affluent suburbanite who encourages him to give
evening recitations of half-baked mystic pronouncements to
rapt living room audiences.
   Adultery and punditry liberate him, and he takes the
narrator, his 17-year-old son Karim, with him when his new
love moves her menage to London.
   The potential humor of the charlatan mystic and his
gullible flock is quickly pushed aside in favor of Karim's
own tale of leaving school and struggling to begin an acting
career.
   Even more unfortunately, Mr. Kureishi also relegates to
the background his most interesting characters, the
politically and sexually active young woman Jamila and her
mail-order husband, Changez.
   Mr. Kureishi finds some of his richest material in the
intersections of South Asian and British traditions. He is
drawn to the follies of English women who will take as a
Buddha a fat civil servant. In Jamila, he creates a liberated
woman who has smashed to smithereens the behavior patterns of
her immigrant Moslem parents.
   What weapon does her father have to bend Jamila to his
will? Gandhi's weapon, of course. So, in suburban London,
above his shabby little grocery named Paradise Stores,
Jamila's father fasts to force her to accept the husband his
brother in India has selected for her. His fast takes him
close to death before she caves in.
   But even after she agrees to marry, she will have no
physical contact with the deformed, obese Changez. This, in
turn drives Changez into the play-for-pay arms of a Japanese
woman with whom he can try out the sexual positions and toys
he reads about in his ever-growing collection of paperback
fiction.
   The novel's funniest moment comes when the now-regretful
father, infuriated by Changez, attacks him with a cane and
Changez defends himself with a just-purchased sex aid. The
father is hospitalized; Karim and Jamila dub Changez, in the
manner of his favorite fiction, "The Dildo Killer."
   Mr. Kureishi's films are funny, charming and (mildly)
shocking by turns. He seems to be aiming for the same effects
here. He has a talent for description. When Mr. Kureishi
describes the facades lining a street, you could build the
movie set.
   But, the first-person narration is weak. Karim is a naive
teen-ager when the novel opens and he seems awkward and
adolescent to the end. He observes, but never becomes an
emotionally engaging character.
   At times Karim is unintentionally funny. "Life had offered
these people its lips, but as they dragged from party to
party, seeing the same faces and saying the same things night
after night, I saw it was the kiss of death; I saw how much
was enervated and useless in them," he tells us of a wealthy
London crowd.
   His attempts at literary allusion fall flat: "The ceremony
of innocence was well drowned as far as they were concerned,"
he says of a group of sexually precocious female schoolmates.
(Peace, W.B. Yeats)
   Karim's thoughts on sex, a major preoccupation, are no
more interesting. Both sexes attract and please Karim,
prompting him to attempt a simile: "I felt it would be
heart-breaking to have to choose one or the other, like
having to decide between the Beatles and the Rolling Stones."
   Karim-in-love is as unconvincing as Karim-brokenhearted.
Because he generally takes sexual partners as casually as
others would choose their music, the novel fails when it
attempts to portray two sexual episodes as major turning
points in his life. Even group sex and masochism seem
uninflected in "Buddha's" listless narration.
   Karim drifts from experience to experience, and the novel
drifts with him, lacking focus, lacking a point of view.
"Perhaps in the future I would live more deeply," Karim tells
us on the last page.
   Let's hope.

   WASHINGTON -- Manufacturing productivity showed a big

overcome sharp declines in other sectors of the economy, the
Labor Department said.
   While manufacturing productivity -- output per hour of
work -- jumped at a 4.1% annual rate, overall business
productivity dropped at a 0.5% annual rate, the department
said. When workers in the farm sector are excluded, giving
what many economists view as a better picture of underlying
economic forces, productivity fell at a 1% annual rate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Productivity is critical to maintaining the
competitiveness of U.S. companies, to keeping the economy
growing without accelerating inflation, and to raising the
standard of living. If workers produce more per hour,
businesses are able to increase wages without incurring
higher costs. That means they don't have to raise prices,
which would eat up the benefits of the pay increases.
   The report did contain some evidence that wage increases
are slowing, suggesting that some inflationary pressures may
be easing. Hourly compensation rose at a 3.9% annual rate in
the first quarter, far short of the 6% rate in the fourth
quarter and the 5.5% increase for all of 1989. At the same
time, the labor costs of a unit of production grew at a 4.9%
annual rate, trailing the 5.5% annual rate in the fourth
quarter but ahead of the 4.5% increase for all of 1989.
   The increase in hourly pay wasn't nearly enough, however,
to keep workers even with inflation. In fact, they were
making 3.9% less an hour in the first quarter than in the
fourth, after the effects of inflation were removed, the
report said.
   The drop in non-farm productivity reflected an increase in
output at a 2.7% annual rate and a rise in hours worked at a
3.6% annual rate. The jump in manufacturing productivity
stemmed from a 3.2% rate of decline in hours worked,
reflecting the sluggish economy, and a 0.8% rate of growth in
output.
   Lawrence Chimerine, an economic consultant in
Philadelphia, said the new productivity report "reinforces a
fundamental problem in this country -- that we are mired in
slow productivity growth."
   Mr. Chimerine and other economists said manufacturing
productivity probably isn't as good, nor service productivity
as bad, as the latest report suggests.
   Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board in New
York, said it wasn't surprising to see a surge in
manufacturing productivity during a slowing economy. "When
the economy slows down in growth, you wind up with fewer of
the resources in production, both in terms of labor and
capital," he said. "Presumably those people and machines
idled are the least productive."
   To make true, lasting gains in worker productivity, Mr.
Chimerine said, the country must improve its education system
and rate of investment.
   All the numbers in the report were adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations.

   Malaysia Minding Its Manners to Court Tourists

   Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia -- "On your left, ladies and
gentlemen, is the prison where we hung the Australians," the
tour guide told us over a crackly microphone on the tour bus.
   In Malaysia, a country famous for putting foreigners to
death for drug-trafficking offenses, it is the year of the
tourist.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Malaysians, at the prime minister's request, are taking
extremely seriously their "responsibility" to be polite to
guests.
   The country's tenacious strongman, Mahathir Mohamad (who
has called Vietnamese asylum-seekers "scum"), wants the red
carpet rolled out for legal, paying guests in an attempt to
emulate neighboring Thailand's successful Visit Thailand
campaign three years ago.
   Malaysia's international campaign aims to attract 4.2
million visitors, most of whom have never heard of the
country. Its local campaign focuses on the proper etiquette
for entertaining foreigners.
   In typical Malay fashion, the domestic campaign is
straightforward and guileless. Television advertisements and
billboards urge citizens to open their homes, say "thank
you," promote cleanliness and smile.
   When the domestic airline recently overbooked a flight to
Australia, the stranded passengers were put up in private
homes. Local newspapers ran page-one photos of tired tourists
perched on the edge of living room sofas with their smiling
hosts.
   An American pauses to admire a typical store-front altar,
and within seconds an older Malaysian man hobbles up and
begins explaining local customs.
   It's charming, but all this gushing over tourists can go
too far. A newspaper article complains about "unsightly"
homeless people and beggars whose presence may offend
tourists. But some tourists are more offended by the efforts
to sanitize the "tourist areas."
   "It's a lovely country," says Jonathan Miller, an American
visitor. "But I feel guilty when I read an article like that;
it's too much."
   "Malaysia's biggest problem is its image. It has none,"
says Martin Prey, a tourism consultant with Peat Marwick.
   Mr. Prey and other tourism experts say Malaysia has great
potential as a tourist destination. Although it lacks the
dramatic allure of some of its neighbors, it has a simple
beauty of its own: miles of white sand beaches and unspoiled
jungle; clean hotels; pleasant people; and delicious Malay,
Chinese and Indian cuisine. English is widely spoken, and
service facilities such as banks, taxis and the telephone
system are well-maintained and efficient.
   Malaysia is well-positioned between Singapore and
Thailand, two of Southeast Asia's most-visited destinations.
The December coup attempt in the Philippines, which trapped
hundreds of guests in their hotels and closed the airport for
days, could benefit Malaysia.
   The country's self-conscious promotion focusing on
"exotic" Malaysia doesn't reflect the country's strongest
selling points: It is a pleasant and gracious developing
country where travel is cheap and comparatively
annoyance-free.
   Granted independence from the British in 1957, Malaysia
has followed a moderately insular policy concerned with
maintaining racial harmony among Malays, Chinese and Indians,
and industrialization aimed at broadening a prime commodity
export-based economy.
   Although there is racial tension, the three communities
live together in peace, albeit without a great deal of
integration. As for the second goal: The export of electronic
components now outpaces the export of oil.
   Tourism, however is a relatively new concept.
   "For a long time there was no political will to develop
the industry," says Malaysia's current Minister of Culture
and Tourism, Sabbaruddin Chik. He says the recognition of
tourism as one of the biggest industries in the world
prompted the government to establish his ministry just three
years ago. Since 1987, the number of hotel rooms in the
country has been expanded, resorts have been built and
transportation systems improved.
   Tourist arrivals are up, and many visitors comment on the
sincerity and courtesy of the Malaysians. But not all
Malaysians are noticing the economic windfalls of tourism. In
fact, the man on the street may see the opposite.
   "I'd like to invite you to my home," said a friendly man
selling post cards. "But I served dinner to some American
tourists who were looking for a restaurant last night, and
I'm broke today."

   MIT Scientists Rethink Artificial Intelligence

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- As futuristic robots go, Genghis isn't
much to look at.
   The six-legged, foot-long contraption could pass as a
sixth-grader's wire sculpture of an ant. The researchers who
built it whimsically designed the thing to chase people --
like its namesake, Mr. Khan. As an attack robot, though,
Genghis isn't quite up to speed. It lurches slowly across a
floor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and almost
crashes into a wall. Still, its designers are very proud of
what their creation can do -- for unlike most robots, Genghis
doesn't have a brain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At least not in the ordinary computing sense of a
centralized control program. Instead, Genghis has a network
of small, simple control programs, each devoted to a single
function such as lifting a leg. They work independently but
are connected to interact something like bees in a hive. From
their collective action, walking "emerges" -- as a store of
honey emerges from bees' interactions.
   Genghis may lurch, but researchers at MIT's artificial
intelligence laboratory are using it to mount a frontal
assault on the conventional wisdom in artificial
intelligence, the attempt to mimic human thinking with
computers. Since the 1950s, AI research has been dominated by
big, complex systems aimed at copying higher thought
processes, such as the ability to understand this sentence.
Despite some successes, the approach so far has emulated
human intelligence about as well as early aircraft flew by
flapping bird-like wings.
   Now at MIT and some other places, AI researchers are
trying a radically different approach. Their idea, called
"bottom-up" AI, is to build interacting networks of many
relatively simple devices, or "agents." The agents might be a
network of little software functionaries running on
off-the-shelf chips, as in Genghis. Or they could be
separate, interacting machines -- the MIT researchers
envision "robot insect societies" that clean up oil spills,
build dams, explore other planets or pounce on dust balls
under the radiator.
   Such swarms of cheap little robots "would be sort of like
parallel processors," fast, new computers that perform many
calculations at once, says Anita Flynn, one of the MIT team.
"Only they would be doing mechanical work."
   If set up right -- a big if, critics say -- these networks
of agents can give rise to surprisingly complex and flexible
collective action. When hit by a transient power outage,
Genghis collapses and flails its legs helplessly; the ability
to coordinate them has been erased from the agents inside the
robot. Soon, however, the flailings begin to look more
coordinated. Within a couple of minutes, the agents gradually
"learn" again how to make Genghis stand up and go.
   The process uncannily resembles an accelerated version of
a six-legged infant learning to walk. What happens is that
"the agents learn how to avoid receiving negative feedback,"
which they get from sensors on Genghis's belly when it falls
down, says Pattie Maes, an MIT visitor from Belgium who
recently added the learning ability to Genghis's repertoire.
   In a sense, the agents program themselves to walk, trying
different actions and learning from the sensors -- and from
communication among themselves -- which movements work and
which don't. For example, it learns to always keep at least
three legs on the ground, adopting a pattern of movement seen
in insects and familiar to entomologists called the
alternating tripod gait.
   A conventional robot could handle such challenges as
learning to walk only if they were foreseen by its designers
and precisely accounted for in its master control program.
But foreseeing all the problems that crop up in real-world
situations is almost impossible. Thus, robots, and
conventional AI systems in general, work best in tightly
constrained environments where surprises are minimized.
Examples include assembly-line robots and chess-playing
programs. Similarly, AI programs once touted as potential
rivals of human experts haven't lived up to such expectations
because they're often fooled by real-world complexities.
   The bottom-up approach won't necessarily overcome such
problems. But it shows promise at cracking them, partly
because it "decentralizes things so you don't have a big
program that breaks" when something unexpected happens, says
MIT's Marvin Minsky, considered one of AI's leading lights.
Mr. Minsky isn't directly involved with MIT's new robots, but
his theory that the mind is a society of agents has helped
inspire them.
   MIT's robot researchers don't plan to tackle human
intelligence head-on. They would be happy to replicate insect
smarts. Thus, they've created Squirt, a matchbox-sized robot
with wheels that acts something like a cockroach: It hides in
dark corners, ventures out in the direction of noises (after
the noises are long gone) and then tries to hide again near
the noises' origin.
   Now they're planning gnat-sized robots for everything from
attacking potato bugs in the garden to clearing clogged
arteries. In offices decorated with toy robots, they talk
excitedly of doing for AI and robots what personal computers
did for data processing. In keeping with that goal, the
group's hardware guru, Colin Angle, and a friend built a
joystick-controlled, insect-like robot that can walk, pick up
small objects, do handstands and flip. Built in two days for
less than $200, it has balsa-wood legs and is held together
with duct tape.
   Emulating insects is a "noble goal for AI practitioners,"
says Rodney A. Brooks, a transplanted Australian who's
leading the charge of the bottom-up robots at MIT. He notes
that it took evolution about three billion years to go from
single cells to insects, and only about one-sixth of that
time to go from insects to humans. That suggests, he says,
that humans' higher reasoning powers won't be too hard for AI
researchers to replicate once they can mimic insects' ability
to cope with the world's blooming, buzzing confusion.
   But that doesn't quite compute, some AI experts say. "Most
of what enables us to get by in the world, doing the things
that other animals can't do, is knowledge we've developed
culturally," in contrast to insects' lower brain powers, says
AI researcher Douglas Lenat. The bottom-up approach "is
important," he adds. "But we won't achieve true AI until we
also construct systems like Cyc," a huge AI program he's
designing that will incorporate tens of millions of
common-sense rules and other information. It's being
developed at Microelectronics &amp; Computer Technology Corp., a
research group in Austin, Texas.
   In any case, bottom-up ideas, which have been simmering
for decades in AI research, are now bubbling over and making
a splash. One reason is neural networks, a variation on the
bottom-up theme in which the agents are rough likenesses of
the brain's neurons. Such computers are showing promise in
computer vision, speech recognition and many other uses.
   Danny Hillis, founder of Thinking Machines Inc., a
Cambridge, Mass., computer company, is pursuing another
bottom-up idea: artificial evolution. The method
automatically creates programs for certain tasks by randomly
generating and combining hundreds of possible programs in one
of Thinking Machines' computers. Each is tested for its
ability to perform the task; only the fittest are allowed to
survive and be recombined to form a new generation of
programs. Eventually, programs emerge from this computational
swamp that are comparable to those a human might write, says
Mr. Hillis.

   Greyhound Chairman Asserts Bus Line
   Is `Coming Back Strong' Despite Strike

   DALLAS -- Fred Currey, chairman of Greyhound Lines Inc.,
said that the strike-hobbled bus company is "coming back
strong" and that a walkout by the Amalgamated Transit Union
has been effectively defeated. The closely held company is
struggling to stave off bankruptcy-law proceedings.
   "This national institution is being revived, this national
institution will be alive and well for the summer of 1990,"
Mr. Currey said at a news conference at Greyhound
headquarters.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He said that Greyhound is serving locations that
contributed 98% of its pre-strike revenue and that by
mid-June route frequency would be the same as last year on
all major routes. The executive said the company needs to
achieve about 85% of pre-strike revenue to be profitable. He
said revenue currently is running at between 65% and 75% of
pre-strike levels.
   Because of strike-related first-quarter losses totaling
$55.8 million, Greyhound missed a $5 million April 30 lease
payment and won't make a $9.8 million interest payment May 15
on its 13% senior notes due in 1995. Because of the missed
interest payment, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. downgraded its
rating on the senior notes to triple-C-minus from
single-B-minus.
   Hoping to avoid a federal bankruptcy-law filing, the
company is negotiating with creditors and lenders on a major
financial restructuring.
   "We expect and we have received cooperation from all the
parties concerned," Mr. Currey said of those talks. He added
that the company has sufficient cash on hand to continue to
operate its business and to conduct a $4 million summer
advertising campaign. He declined to discuss details.
   The Greyhound chairman described the often violent
two-month-old strike by 9,400 ATU members as "irrelevant"
because, he said, the unit of GLI Holding Co. is close to
having sufficient new drivers and union crossovers -- about
4,000 in all -- to operate its sharply reduced system at or
near capacity during the peak summer travel period.
   Mr. Currey said that Greyhound would continue to negotiate
with the ATU but that even if a new contract is reached, the
company would have jobs for only between 500 and 1,000 of the
approximately 5,800 ATU drivers still on strike.
   "For all practical purposes, this event is effectively
concluded," he said of the walkout.
   Union officials reacted angrily. "They're almost fighting
words," said Jim Cushing-Murray, president of the ATU's Los
Angeles local. "They're almost the kinds of words you would
use if you wanted to provoke drivers' responses."
   Talks between the union and the company were suspended
indefinitely after a weekend bargaining session in which
Greyhound proposed a new contract that called for a four-year
wage freeze. The union, whose members took a 23% pay cut when
a group led by Mr. Currey bought the company in 1986, has
been demanding across-the-board pay increases totaling about
13% over three years.

   Lockheed Insists It Won't Take a Loss
   On Navy's P-7 Anti-Submarine Aircraft

   CALABASAS, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp. Chairman Daniel Tellep
reiterated that there is no way the company "will accept a
loss" on production of the P-7 anti-submarine aircraft,
adding that "there is no reason we can't make a profit" on
the program.
   Mr. Tellep's comments, made in an interview, may help to
mitigate fears on Wall Street that the U.S.'s sixth-largest
military contractor is in for another write-down once the
company finalizes pricing arrangements on the plane with the
Navy. Mr. Tellep said that "there is definitely progress
being made" on those negotiations, and they could be wrapped
up by July.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I'm encouraged," said the chief executive, who has met
with Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett on the matter. Mr.
Tellep added that "we're not asking for a bailout. No one is
letting us off the hook."
   The P-7, designed to replace Lockheed's P-3 Orion, has
been a headache for the company since it was etched on the
drawing board. Managers badly miscalculated how much the new
plane would have in common with its predecessor, and Lockheed
was forced last year to take a $300 million charge because of
the cost overruns that will result from the development
error.
   Mr. Tellep, who in March visited with securities analysts
during the company's proxy fight with Dallas investor Harold
Simmons, insisted then that Lockheed wouldn't record a
deficit on P-7 production, no matter what.
   Nonetheless, many industry observers have questioned
lately whether Lockheed might take at least a small hit, or
possibly default on the whole deal, thereby dragging the
issue into court. "If the Navy held the company's feet to the
fire, there is no question that their price and Lockheed's
price could be very far apart," said Michael Rosen, aerospace
analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   When it signed the development accord, Lockheed offered up
pricing and cost estimates for assembling the plane, but with
the redesign and a resulting two-year delay, there is no way
it can meet those targets. Some analysts have gone so far as
to say that the company risks losing billions of dollars over
the life of the pact.
   But Mr. Tellep asserted: "There is no reason to have
write-offs. We're entitled to have an equitable adjustment"
from the government. Navy officials wouldn't comment, except
to say they are still talking with the company.
   Mr. Tellep, calling the P-7 situation "a classic case of
total package procurement," effectively blasted the
government for forcing companies to lock into fixed prices
before the companies really have a handle on what a
complicated piece of hardware is going to cost to produce.
"It hasn't worked in the past, and it doesn't work now," he
said.
   At this point, Mr. Tellep said, Lockheed and the Navy have
come up with a "technical configuration" for the P-7 that
"meets all the essential performance requirements" the
Pentagon has been looking for: the ability to fly 1,600
nautical miles from home base, linger over waters for as long
as four hours, and then fly home -- all on one tank of gas.
   The chairman stressed that a cost schedule hasn't been
worked out, and the final numbers ultimately will depend on
the rate at which the planes are purchased. He suggested,
however, that there was little chance the whole project would
be scrapped. "The Navy is very much committed to maritime
patrol aircraft and the P-7 in particular," Mr. Tellep said.
   He declined to give even a range of cost estimates for
building the plane.
   One possible solution being considered, according to Mr.
Tellep, is for the Navy to cut the total number of planes it
will buy from the 123 P-7s originally envisioned. That would
drive up the expense of each plane, but the move could keep
steady the price tag of the entire program. Before the
development snafu, the Navy had valued the P-7 project, from
start to finish, at about $8 billion.
   Still, despite the chairman's optimism, Mr. Rosen noted
that simply making up lost ground from the P-7 design will be
difficult. With a $300 million write-down already on the
books, he said, "they're pretty far in the hole."

   Now, a handful of oil superpowers increasingly sets the
agenda for and determines the outcome of such meetings, with
much of the negotiating taking place before meetings.
   "Those with the excess capacity have the power," says
Lawrence Goldstein of Petroleum Industry Research Foundation
based in New York.
   Only four countries ringing the oil-rich Persian Gulf --
Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia -- plus Venezuela command
the reserves and pumping ability that will be needed to
address long-term world demand. That group, founding members
of OPEC, alone accounts for more than 60% of the world's one
trillion barrels of proved oil reserves. Except possibly for
the United Arab Emirates, also on the Persian Gulf, the rest
of OPEC is believed either to be already pumping at or near
capacity, or likely to reach that stage soon.
   "We've reached a point where eight or nine countries have
factored themselves out of the decision-making process" in
OPEC, says Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister.
   Certainly, the clout of OPEC's bit players is diminishing
as the top producers call the shots more than ever before.
Consider the just-concluded meeting here:
   Diego Tamariz, Ecuador's oil minister, checked into
Geneva's Intercontinental Hotel largely ignored and carrying
his own suitcase. As he did at the previous meeting in Vienna
last March, he spent a lot of time in his hotel room alone
while ministers from OPEC's major producers huddled in huge
suites down the hall.
   Mr. Tamariz concedes that he doesn't have much of a role
in such strategy sessions anymore; his oil production of less
than 300,000 barrels a day is just too small. Ecuador, ranked
12th, pumps barely more than 1% of the total 23.5 million
barrels a day recently being produced by all 13 members of
OPEC.
   At least he was here. Gabon and Qatar, two other
small-scale members, didn't even send their oil ministers
this time -- or last. This is a major turnabout for OPEC's
smaller producers who only a few years ago were among the
cartel's pricing leaders. For example, Libya was the first to
break the $30-a-barrel level and others followed.
   Even more telling were the behind-the-scenes negotiations
leading up to the session.
   With prices skidding 25% this year, the oil markets wanted
a signal that OPEC would corral output, which by some
estimates had been running 1.5 million barrels a day above
its self-imposed ceiling and two million above demand. In a
significant move, Indonesian minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita,
a respected and frequent mediator in OPEC affairs, concluded
a full ministerial meeting wasn't needed. He sent a facsimile
message to Saudi Arabia asking oil minister Hisham Nazer to
simply work out a solution to the crisis with other Persian
Gulf nations.
   Mr. Ginandjar's logic was sound. After all, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and United Arab Emirates, among OPEC's largest
producers, had sparked the price decline by producing beyond
quota and flooding the market. And the three responded with a
quick meeting in Jeddah last month, where they promised to
adhere to their assigned quotas. But oil prices continued to
slide.
   With much of OPEC in a near panic, the acting president,
Sadek Boussena of Algeria, hastily called an urgent meeting
of all the ministers and drew up a script that would make
OPEC appear swift and decisive. But Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
maintained a grip on the process because its success or
failure depended on their willingness to cut output. In the
end, they endorsed a plan that, on paper at least, would
erase nearly all the overproduction. The meeting lasted less
than two days -- one of OPEC's shortest ever.
   Appropriately, the same two cartel heavyweights pledged to
shoulder almost 60% of the cut, effectively taking on
responsibility for the price of oil for the near future.
   The concentration of OPEC's future production ability and
pricing power within a few nations doesn't automatically
spell trouble for oil consumers. Though OPEC accounts for 45%
of consumption by the non-Communist world, the leading
producers are launching multibillion-dollar programs to
further expand their huge capacities even as the oil fields
of others play out. Moreover, the current glut suggests that
the large producers are still more interested in gaining
market share than in working in concert to force higher and
higher prices.
   Within OPEC, of course, the potential implications of a
majority of members running out of oil are enormous. In time,
OPEC meetings could become meaningless or even disappear. The
Persian Gulf powers -- the only producers with real growth
potential -- could divide up the market in informal talks,
perhaps at most asking other ministers to rubber-stamp each
newly cut bargain.
   Some oil ministers insist that it's only a matter of time
before national production quotas -- necessary in recent
years of excess capacity -- disappear just because most
members will be physically unable to pump more oil. "After
three or four years, the problem will be prices, not the
quotas," says Fawzi A. Shakshuki, Libya's oil minister.
   Already, some members are accepting the notion of running
out of oil. Indonesia so openly acknowledges it has bumped up
against its production limits that its minister, Mr.
Ginandjar, last November broke a logjam by surrendering some
of Indonesia's allotment to others. Last week he again
volunteered output cuts to break an impasse. Others are
having reality imposed on them.
   At the November meeting, a request by Mr. Shakshuki that
Libya be granted production parity with Kuwait as part of
that meeting's pact faced great resistance. In the end, he
finally had to sign onto the settlement, winning nothing.
"Who cares what Libya thinks?" one delegate said.
   If nothing else, OPEC's meetings are losing their cache.
Short-and-sweet gatherings are replacing the drawn-out combat
of the past. In bygone days, chaos ruled when OPEC gathered
at the Intercontinental Hotel here. As many as 600 reporters
and scores of traders, economists and investors jammed the
lobby and hallways, nursing coffee and drinks and watching
ministers openly scrap. The crowd, rabid for the slightest
scrap of information, would pounce on any official who
strayed by. Fewer than 100 people monitored last week's
meeting, filling less than one-third of the lobby.
   The shrinking of OPEC's unused capacity to five million
barrels a day from the 10 million or 11 million barrels of
less than a decade ago is prompting some to question the
future role of the organization.
   "Why should we limit ourselves only to oil?" asks Felix P.
Rossi-Guerrero, a Venezuelan ambassador-at-large. "We could
hold meetings on agriculture. We could talk about trade and
the environment," he says. Mr. Nazer of Saudi Arabia, which
boasts one-fourth of the world's total oil reserves, also
sees new roles for OPEC, such as oil-related training and
technical assistance.
   Still, it's unlikely that OPEC anytime soon will hold a
meeting and no one will come. "The big brothers need the
shield of the small fry" so they can retain their claim as
defender of the Third World and avoid becoming known as a
rich man's club, says one former oil minister. And the small
fry need the superpowers for price protection, bargaining
leverage and political prestige. Without the OPEC umbrella,
small producers say they would never have been able to
nationalize their oil fields or develop them on favorable
terms with the international oil companies.
   Many, therefore, will struggle to preserve their status,
however humble, within the group. That's already happening in
Mr. Tamariz's Ecuador, where gasoline taxes have been boosted
to discourage domestic consumption and maximize the amount of
oil available for export. As a result, bicycles and public
transportation are carrying more and more workers in Quito,
the capital, to their jobs.

   Car Races Lose Some of Their Appeal
   To Sponsors Tired of Cost and Clutter

   Valvoline Inc., one of the oldest sponsors of auto racing,
is waving a yellow flag. Its favorite sport is getting too
expensive, too fast.
   At the Indianapolis 500 later this month, the motor-oil
company's name probably will be seen on just 17 cars, about
half as many as it sponsored a decade ago. Valvoline used to
be able to cover the track with its marketing dollars, says
John D. Barr, president of Valvoline, a unit of Ashland Oil
Co. "But the price has escalated so rapidly, we can't do that
anymore."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For Valvoline, along with other longtime racing sponsors
such as Anheuser-Busch Cos. and Quaker State Corp., the
marketing appeal of the track is fading, even as the
popularity of the sport explodes. Car racing, they say, is
suffering from sponsor overload. Spark-plug makers, motor-oil
producers and other auto-related companies once had the track
to themselves. No more. Sponsors have poured in, bidding up
the price tags on winning teams and increasing the clutter of
brand names on wheels. These days, race cars are sponsored by
everything from Tide detergent to Secret deodorant to Hanes
garments. Wedging into this year's Indy races for the first
time will be Snickers candy bars, McDonald's, Panasonic,
Target Stores and Gillette.
   "Every car you look at is a traveling billboard,"
complains Leo Mehl, director of racing for Goodyear.
   The number of sponsors for Indy-style racing this year has
climbed to 165 from 90 in 1985, while spending has soared 90%
to $95 million, according to Championship Auto Racing Teams
Inc., or Cart, the sanctioning group for Indy car racing.
   To get their brands displayed on a top race team's cars,
sponsors have to shell out fees ranging from $50,000 to $5
million a year, depending on the size of decals and other
factors, such as endorsements in ads. On top of that,
sponsors also usually provide fuel, uniforms and other
support materials. Companies also say that for each
sponsorship dollar, they spend another $1 to $3 on related
promotions and advertising, such as billboards and
sweepstakes.
   Racing enthusiasts and professionals say sponsorship mania
and the resulting climb in prices stem directly from the
growing interest in all types of auto racing, whether rural
drag strips, the Indy races or stock-car racing. Expanded
television coverage on broadcast and cable networks, along
with aggressive promotions, have helped build interest in the
sport, especially among women, who now make up half the
audience at some races. Awareness is likely to increase even
further this summer with the opening of "Days of Thunder," a
car-racing movie starring the popular actor Tom Cruise.
   As popularity increases, there's competition to get
display on the best team's cars, so "now you've got to spend
more money to get bigger visibility," says Don Dixon,
chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Marketing Services. Racing
experts say Philip Morris Cos. paid an estimated $35 million
in a three-year pact to sponsor two cars. (A company
spokesman declines to comment on terms of the deal.)
   Valvoline spends about $10 million a year on motor sports
sponsorships. That's three times what it spent in 1980, so
the company now is trying to be selective to hold the line on
costs. Racing has been religion at Valvoline for nearly three
decades, so dropping some programs isn't popular. "It's the
most sensitive issue in the company," Mr. Barr says.
   Spending has shifted to focus on where the brand's name
will get the best exposure. At various tracks, there will be
fewer billboards featuring the Valvoline logo. In some cases,
the company is sponsoring events, rather than teams. For a
fraction of what it costs to support a team for a year,
Valvoline nows sponsors the Detroit Grand Prix, which is
billed as the Valvoline Detroit Grand Prix.
   There's no fully sponsored Valvoline car in the National
Association of Stock Car Racing circuit. The company couldn't
strike a deal with a top team. If the company does link up
with a good team, some other ad spending may be cut to
compensate. "It might be worth more exposure than 10
television commercials," Mr. Barr says. Valvoline still has
one fully sponsored Indy car, driven by Al Unser Jr. To
support that team, Valvoline is running a sweepstakes that
awards free trips to next year's Indy 500.
   Anheuser-Busch is trying to use its clout as a heavy
advertiser to "keep the cash payments {to teams} in line,"
says Mark Lamping, director of sports marketing. "We have to
be careful we don't reach a point where you price yourself
out of a sponsorship."
   Already some companies have bailed out. Quaker Oats Co.'s
Gatorade unit doesn't sponsor a car in Nascar, the stock-car
circuit, anymore. Instead, it awards prize money to drivers
at a variety of races. This year Stroh Brewery Co. won't be a
sponsor of any national events, just a few minor regional
races. Quaker State has reduced its sponsorships, too.
   Even some of the nontraditional sponsors who signed up in
the early 1980s are rethinking the costs. Procter &amp; Gamble
Co.'s Crisco shortening had sponsored a car in Nascar races
since 1986, but it discontinued the program this year. The
consumer products company is also reviewing its contract on
its Secret deodorant car in the Trans Am circuit. "These
programs are very expensive," a P&amp;G spokeswoman says. "Other
programs are more cost effective" for Secret. For instance,
P&amp;G says it's "very happy" with the brand's sponsorship of
women's golf tournaments. (P&amp;G's Tide and Folgers brands
still sponsor race cars.)
   Race organizers say there's always turnover among
sponsors. "There are fewer players qualified from a budget
standpoint, but there's not a shortage of people who want to
get in," says William Stokkan, Cart's chairman-elect, who
plans to recruit more international brands as sponsors.
   Team owners say some sponsors don't know how to make the
most of their investment. "You can't go in, give a million
dollars and not take advantage of it," says Rick Galles,
co-chairman of Galles Kraco Racing, which has been racing at
Indy since 1983. Mr. Galles recommends heavy promotional
tie-ins.
   He does concede there's a danger in the rising costs.
"We've got to do more things that will raise income for the
team, but not increase the costs to the point where the
sponsors will get out," Mr. Galles says. He suggests more
merchandising, such as a line of clothing endorsed by
drivers, or more world-wide television packages.
   One solution seen by many sponsors such as Valvoline is to
spend more money at small local tracks where racing is still
valued more for sport than for big business. "That's where
the Valvoline brand evolved," says Mr. Barr.
   It may be too late for even that. Genesee Corp., a
Rochester, N.Y., beer maker, says it can no longer afford to
sponsor racing at the local track in Watkins Glen, N.Y.
"They've gotten spoiled by the large checks," a spokesman
says. "What we did for a couple cases of beer and a paint
job, they now want $25,000."

   Icahn Loses Proxy Bid to Force
   USX to Spinoff Steel Business

   Investor's Vote Share Likely
   To Be 40%; Core Lines
   May Still Be Put on Sale

   FINDLAY, Ohio -- New York investor Carl Icahn lost his bid
to force USX Corp. out of steel. But the bitter battle
ultimately may prod the company to sell at least part of the
core business.
   Mr. Icahn's failure to win enough support for his plan to
spin off at least 80% of USX's steel business means the
company will remain for now the nation's largest steelmaker.
But the proxy battle, which culminated with yesterday's vote
by USX shareholders here, also gave management an earful of
shareholder dissatisfaction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "As shareholders, we're the owners of USX. Let's start
acting like them," said a disgruntled Nick Rossi, whose
family holds 3,250 shares and supported Mr. Icahn's plan.
   Even holders who voted with management voiced concern over
what they consider to be a lackluster value for USX shares.
As a result, the proxy battle has increased the likelihood
that at some point in the next few years USX will take steps
leading to the partial or full divestiture of steel, a
business the company virtually founded with its creation in
1901 by J.P. Morgan.
   Recent "strategy has always been to do something with the
steel business," said one director. "I think something will
happen there." During the roughly two-hour meeting at
Findlay's Central Junior High School Auditorium, USX Chairman
Charles A. Corry said: "This is a corporation that has
changed and will continue to change. That is inevitable."
   Although the final tally won't be known for at least
several days, people on both sides of the contest indicated
privately that the outcome was not in doubt and that the
proposal had been defeated.
   Mr. Icahn said he had no more than about 80 million
certain shares, including his own 34 million backing his
proposal. That represents only about 40% of the 200 million
or so shares that were expected to be cast, indicating that
no more than one in three shares other than his own endorsed
the spinoff of steel.
   "Whether we win or lose, we have made a statement here. A
lot of shareholders have spoken," Mr. Icahn said. He said
that he had apparently lost the support of five or six "key"
institutions that had voted with management, but only after
some had written to Mr. Corry urging major changes at the
company.
   The investor, who has been a USX shareholder since 1986
and owns 13.3% of the company, vowed to retain his holding
until the stock value appreciates. He said yesterday's vote
wouldn't be his "last stand."
   Ever since USX -- then U.S. Steel Corp. -- got into the
energy business with its purchase in 1982 of Marathon Oil,
based here, the issue of USX's stock valuation has dogged
management. Pittsburgh-based USX paid $5.8 billion, and for
several years after the market value for both Marathon and
its steel business was considerably less than the purchase
price. That undervaluation drew Mr. Icahn to invest in the
company and agitate for higher values.
   His on-again, off-again battle with USX management
climaxed March 8, when management agreed to submit to
shareholders his non-binding proposal to spin off the steel
business as a special dividend. Mr. Icahn contended that
doing so would increase the value of USX stock to $48 a
share, with Marathon alone valued at $39 a share and U.S.
Steel at $9. USX stock fell 50 cents yesterday to close at
$33.50 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   At the heart of his unprecedented shareholder resolution
is the future of the steel business. Mr. Icahn argued that
the profits and cash flow of Marathon propped up what is an
inherently labor-intensive and capital-draining steel
segment.
   "Why should we jeopardize the future of the oil business?"
Mr. Icahn asked the roughly 600 shareholders who attended the
meeting. He likened it to asking the smartest child in a farm
family to work in the fields rather than go to medical or law
school.
   Mr. Icahn argued that even the much-improved USX steel
business -- bolstered in recent years through the shutdown of
unprofitable facilities and the furlough of tens of thousands
of steelworkers -- effectively acts as a "poison pill." He
said potential buyers of Marathon's lucrative oil assets
wouldn't touch USX because of past and future liabilities
related to its steel business.
   In fact, he believes Marathon Oil alone would trade higher
than USX's current trading value. "The North Sea {where
Marathon has extensive holdings} would be a dream come true
to some of these foreigners," Mr. Icahn said. He refused,
though, to identify any potential buyers who, he asserted,
approached him.
   It was the prospect of Marathon's strength to counter
steel's down cycle that initially attracted management. That
was in 1982, ironically the last time USX and Marathon
brought shareholders together here.
   USX apparently convinced the bulk of shareholders that its
strategy of having two businesses complement each other
proved correct in recent years, when steel operations
outperformed Marathon Oil, hurt by low crude-oil prices. The
company also apparently persuaded shareholders that splitting
the two businesses would only increase costs by creating more
administrative, insurance, and borrowing expenses, and
wouldn't add more than $10 a share to USX's stock price, as
Mr. Icahn suggested.
   But perhaps the most convincing argument that USX put
forward was that its management isn't opposed to change and
would continue its current program of selling assets to
reduce debt and buy back stock. W. Bruce Thomas, USX vice
chairman-administration and chief financial officer, said
investors seem to back that program and haven't indicated a
clear mandate to change that direction. Mr. Thomas has also
said the company considered as recently as 1988 selling about
20% of the steel business to the public in a stock offering,
and that management would likely revisit that proposal when
the steel market rebounds, possibly within two or three
years.
   While Mr. Corry was cautious not to predict the outcome of
the vote, he said he felt the company was "successful
generally" in arguing against the spinoff. "The board and
management will do all we can to reshape the company
intelligently and in a constructive manner based on the
interest of all shareholders," Mr. Corry said.
   However, one area that apparently hasn't gone as well as
planned is the sale of USX's Texas Oil &amp; Gas reserves. Mr.
Corry had hoped to sell those reserves for about $1.5 billion
in the first quarter. But the reserves couldn't be sold in
one piece and had to be parceled. And some of the parcels
failed to attract a premium price and will be retained for
now.

   South Korea President, in Turnabout,
   Says Nation's Economy Isn't in Crisis

   SEOUL, South Korea -- President Roh Tae Woo attempted to
buck up flagging Korean confidence by declaring, in a major
turnabout, that Korea's economy isn't in a crisis.
   Mr. Roh and his leading economic advisers for the past
year had been saying a crisis was at hand, even though the
country was expected to record gross national product growth
of about 7% in 1990. Many economists said the crisis talk was
a clear attempt by the government to scare unions into
moderating their demands, but it had the unwanted effect of
weakening the morale of businesses and investors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Roh said as much in a televised address Monday. "It is
wrong to think we have an economic crisis on hand," he said.
"The real problem is that a pervasive sense of anxiety is
making the situation more troublesome than it actually is."
   The president admitted the country's politicians and
technocrats have made mistakes, but he said he was getting
tough on big business, which dominates the economy. He said
such firms "will be induced -- if necessary, forced -- to
dispose of their nonproductive or excessive real-estate
holdings."
   The president's attempt to turn around business and
investor psychology came after a weekend that saw labor
strikes that rocked the nation a week ago dissipate.
   The government forcibly ended the strike at the
government-owned Korea Broadcasting System and most of the
Hyundai Group factories are operating again after tens of
thousands struck last week. But about 60 scofflaw unionists
at Hyundai Heavy Industries are camped out atop the
shipyard's 270-foot tall crane, out of the reach of police.
The union members started talks with the company Sunday.
   The stock market, after plunging early last week, is
surging. After a four-session rally it closed at 791.56, up
9.23 points Monday, and up 102.93, or 14.9%, since the April
30 tumble.
   But there are still signals that all isn't well. Strikes
over wages are still likely as inflation forecasts multiply.
The most optimistic government reports say consumer prices
will rise about 7%, while other economists say the consumer
price index will hit double-digits in 1990.
   "This won't lead to a nationwide uprising. The government
is too strong," said Phee Jung-Sun, a labor consultant with
close ties to leading militant unions. But there is other bad
news: Corporate earnings will be down and export growth, an
all-important part of the export-driven economy, is still
weak because Korean products have lost competitiveness,
particularly against Japanese exports.
   The stock market's surge may have lost steam. Although it
rose more than 24 points after Mr. Roh's speech, during the
last two hours of the afternoon session it started falling.
Some analysts, such as Thae S. Kwharg, senior analyst with
Baring Brothers &amp; Co. in Seoul, say the market will fall
further this week.
   Korean market analysts say only psychology is driving the
market and when people realize the government isn't proposing
anything new and can't really get tough the market will fall
again.

   A Budget Summit Item

   Hardly a week passes now that some magazine doesn't
publish a cover article on the low estate to which
Washington, especially Congress, has fallen. We've argued for
some time that the so-called budget reform act back in 1974
was the catalyst for this decline. It upset the balance of
power between Congress and the White House and, with the
committee reforms of the time, unbalanced Congress's own
internal discipline as well.
   Against this backdrop, another budget summit is under way
between the Bush White House and Congressional leadership.
While our natural instinct is to look for a sellout of the
no-new-taxes pledge, we have to admit to seeing a silver
lining in these negotiations. There is a sense that the
participants are prepared to bring a level of seriousness to
the table not evident in the past. If that seriousness
persists, Washington may restore some of the credibility it
lacks today with both the public and the financial markets.
Still, how is the public to know if this one's for real?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We think the public will know the budget summit's for real
if it includes several benchmarks. Some consensus seems to
have been reached by both sides to put taxes on the table.
Whatever the price in tax increases, this current round can
be taken seriously only if it includes real spending cuts, if
it emphasizes fixing the process itself rather than just the
deficit numbers, and in particular if it takes concrete steps
to restore discipline to the process.
   For all the Beltway's longtime panting after some sort of
tax increase, it seems to us that taxes are a greatly
underappreciated time bomb in U.S. politics, ticking beneath
an electorate grown impatient with a voracious, arrogant and
inefficient public sector. Understanding well enough the
political risks of raising taxes in this climate, we would
still entertain a tax increase as an acceptable price for
giving the President line-item veto authority over
appropriations.
   There is increasing evidence that the Washington
establishment appreciates the need for putting the item
veto's discipline into the process. The Senate Judiciary
Committee voted 8 to 6 recently to send two versions of
item-veto amendments to the Senate floor. One had the support
of Democrats Paul Simon of Illinois and Howell Heflin of
Alabama, who must go before the voters this fall. "It keeps
our hopes alive of bringing some sanity into the budget
process," Senator Simon said. Ironically, OMB chief Richard
Darman is known to be cool to the idea. Still, President Bush
reiterated during remarks in the Rose Garden recently his
interest in acquiring the ability to control spending, either
with the item veto or the ability to rescind some of the
money in an appropriation.
   There are reasons why the White House and Capitol Hill
should be converging on this issue now.
   The legislative system is in gridlock. There is barely
discussion or debate now about the merits of most new bills
or even ideas because of the horrifying prospect of sending
anything through the budget process. Subjects such as the
country's infrastructure, AIDS funding, the federal science
budget, defense, health-care costs all deserve at least to be
debated extensively, but that rarely happens anymore.
   Committed liberals threw the results of their own Pepper
Commission on long-term health care into the wastebasket,
realizing that just raising the subject was a waste of time.
Conservatives lose heart over SDI as the House Armed Services
Committee mindlessly guts it and other defense programs.
   We're obviously not complaining about a lack of new
spending. Our concern is with a political system that has
made the pork-barrel and special-interest politics its
guiding principle rather than merely a tolerable byproduct.
It has become a system that can't be trusted to spend
rationally because it lacks any institutional discipline over
its worst political instincts. The President, representing
half the legislative process and the national electorate, is
just an adjunct to Congress's budget bartering. But as
Senator Simon said the other day, "The reality is that we
have demonstrated year after year after year that Congress
simply doesn't have the discipline" to operate alone. The
budget process is beyond ideology or partisanship; it is
anarchy.
   So we now have another budget summit, and the air has been
filled the past few days with talk about how everything is up
for negotiation. Fine. But if all this bipartisan support for
putting everything on the table, especially taxes, is only
intended to get another 98.5% House sent back to Washington
in the fall, it's a sham and should be exposed as such. But
if, as we suspect, the White House and congressional
leadership have come to understand that a new institutional
framework, including the item veto, is needed to control and
discipline federal spending, then all issues belong on the
table.

   Doubleday Pulls Out All the Stops
   For Reissue of Stephen King Novel

   NEW YORK -- In 1978, "The Stand" was Stephen King's first
best seller, selling fewer than 100,000 copies in hardcover.
A new, longer version of the novel is now for sale at nearly
double the price, and publisher Doubleday has printed one
million copies.
   The original "Stand" hit the New York Times best seller
list at 15th place and climbed no farther than No. 13: The
new version of the novel will start on the New York Times
list Sunday, in first place. A signed, limited edition of
1,250 copies in black leather stamped with gold is sold out
at $325 each; book collectors have offered the publisher as
much as $1,200 for a copy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Reflected in this episode are the vast changes in the
market for hardcover books over the past decade, but the
principal factor is the singular phenomenon of Mr. King's
popularity. Also, Doubleday, a division of Bertelsmann AG's
Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group Inc. subsidiary, has
pulled out all promotional stops to incite the fans.
   In addition to the deluxe edition, Doubleday got
bookstores across the country to take "reservations" for the
book (which sometimes resulted in a discount) and set up a
special "Stand Hotline" with the details of what's included
in the book. About 200 people a day still call the hotline,
though the book has arrived at most stores in recent weeks.
   When Mr. King approached Doubleday in the mid-80s about
re-issuing the novel, the publisher was skeptical, despite
Mr. King's record for the most best sellers of the past
decade. Doubleday had originally cut about 400 pages from the
book because production costs would have mandated a hardcover
price of $12.95, which seemed too high in 1978 for a
non-best-selling author. "You had an already monstrous book
(823 pages)," says Peter Schneider, Doubleday's director of
marketing. "It's a tremendous story, but would people buy it
again?"
   Bookstore managers say they'll be surprised if Doubleday
can move one million copies of "The Stand: The Complete and
Uncut Edition" in hardcover. But they do expect it to sell
many times better than the original version, which is
extremely rare. In the odd instance when an updated version
of a book is issued, it generally sells far fewer copies, as
when Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's book "August 1914" was
re-issued 17 years later with 80% new material. (Exact sales
figures aren't available.)
   "So far, it isn't doing quite as well as a new Stephen
King, but it's awfully close," says Tom Simon, vice president
of merchandising for the Waldenbooks subsidiary of K mart
Corp. "The big question is the staying power: Is this just a
flurry, or will it stay No. 1 for several months, like most
of his books?"
   One reason for Doubleday's optimistic print run is the
basic change in the hardcover market: While only the hottest
best sellers sold above 75,000 copies in the '70s, best
sellers now routinely sell above 300,000 in hardcover. The
rapid growth in the bookstore chains, along with the more
recent growth in warehouse stores and discount clubs, has
spread books into hundreds of new outlets, most of which
offer substantial discounts to the cover price. The
perception of hardcover books as a splurge has moderated:
Retail price for "The Stand" is $24.95, high even for a major
author, but buyers can find it discounted up to 40%.
   Booksellers say that if this ploy works, Mr. King deserves
the credit. "Danielle Steel, for one, has a huge following,
but I don't think you could re-release one of her back
titles," says Gary DelVecchio, president of Doubleday Book
Shops (no relation to the book's publisher). "Stephen King is
in a class by himself. He's got almost a cult following."
   Not only are his first editions the most prized of
contemporary authors' to collectors, but Mr. King himself is
the subject of more books than he's written, says George
Beahm, author of "The Stephen King Companion." And "The
Stand," with a complicated, fantasy plot about good and evil
and the end of the world, is considered his best book by
fans. "It's ironic," says Mr. Beahm, "that what was once
considered this book's weak point, its length, is now touted
as its strong point."

a million copies of "The Stand: The Complete and Uncut
Edition" by Stephen King. Yesterday's edition misstated the

   Collor's Anti-Inflation
   Plan May Chill Earnings

   SAO PAULO, Brazil -- General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.
and Volkswagen AG didn't produce a car here for five weeks.
   Pansophic System Inc., a U.S. software company, closed its
Brazilian operation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mannesmann AG, a West German steel company, is laying off
workers. Belgian chemical maker Solvay &amp; Cie. has put off its
investment projects.
   The sweeping anti-inflation plan unveiled last month by
Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello hasn't just
affected the lives of 145 million Brazilians. Foreign
companies operating here are also feeling the pinch.
   Indeed, as Brazil braces for recession following the
freeze on some deposits imposed by Mr. Collor to break the
back of Brazil's runaway inflation, the earnings and stock
performance of multinational corporations could be adversely
affected by their Brazilian affiliates' woes. Mr. Collor's
plan removed 70% of Brazil's money from circulation through a
partial 18-month freeze on savings accounts and short-term
financial instruments.
   In the past few weeks, such U.S. giants as auto maker
Ford, tractor-maker Caterpillar Inc. and health concern
Johnson &amp; Johnson have all indicated their 1990 earnings
could be hurt as a result of the Brazilian economic plan, and
other major companies could follow suit. A recent study by
PaineWebber Inc. identified more than 100 U.S. companies with
affiliates in Brazil but said the impact of the plan varies
from company to company. In Europe, shares of some companies
with big operations in Brazil have fallen, and such concerns
as Daimler-Benz AG, which makes trucks in Brazil, also warned
its profits could be hurt by Brazil's slowdown.
   Like Brazilian companies, multinationals saw their markets
shrink and their money for salaries and bills and investments
disappear under the effect of the freeze. And just as for
their Brazilian counterparts, these past six weeks have been
a daily struggle to find creative ways of raising cash and
cutting costs without paying too high a price socially or
economically.
   "The combination of our business being cut in half and our
cash being tied up means we've spent a lot of time wondering
how we'd get through these next few months and continue our
investment projects," says James Nisbet, president of
Monsanto Co.'s Monsanto do Brasil S.A. affiliate. "We've gone
from making good money to losing money in April and trying to
break even the next few months so we don't have to lay off
people."
   Multinationals don't get much sympathy. The Brazilian
government suggests they ask their parent companies for money
to deal with their problems -- to which most parent companies
retort that their affiliates have to solve the problems
themselves. Upset by the attitude of auto makers -- which
stopped production, arguing that there was no demand while
dealers kept charging high interest for cars -- Mr. Collor
indicated last week he would facilitate imports of foreign
cars and allow more foreign auto makers to start
manufacturing to spur competition.
   Some small companies here blame the multinationals for
their problems. Horst Schaade, president of a small Sao Paulo
company that makes machines for several multinationals,
blames the drop in his business on "irresponsible"
multinationals. "Because they don't have orders, they think
they have the right to stop orders they made with us," he
says. "They're working against Brazil."
   To be sure, all companies aren't suffering as badly, and
many companies say it will take months to see how serious the
problems are. Many say activity is starting to pick up after
grinding to a halt in the wake of the liquidity freeze,
albeit at lower levels than before. Some companies, such as
Dow Chemical Co.'s Dow Quimica affiliate, are looking to
exports to compensate for the declining domestic market.
Others, such as N.V. Philips of the Netherlands, are shifting
to less-expensive electronic goods to boost activity.
   And some companies, particularly in the food and beverage
sector, are hurt less than heavy industry is. At Kibon S.A.,
an ice cream maker controlled by Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft
General Foods unit, the worst that will happen is that it
will "lose part of the excess of a better-than-usual season,"
says its president, Peter Schreer. Anticipating some sort of
freeze on financial assets, Kibon had invested much of its
cash in "strategic assets" such as milk, and had enough money
left to meet its payroll, Mr. Schreer says. "I'm broke, but
at least I paid my payroll."
   Many companies aren't so lucky. Mr. Collor's plan has
frozen much of the money multinationals use to pay employees
or invest. His actions also touched off a chain reaction that
is undermining producers of raw materials, capital goods and
better consumer goods: When consumers have no money, they
don't buy. When they don't buy, companies don't produce. When
they don't produce, suppliers stop selling. And when no one
buys or sells, companies talk about lowering salaries, which
will slow the economy still more.
   "Collor had three things to do: stop inflation, stop
inflation, and stop inflation," says Robert Stone, president
of General Motors do Brasil. "It's really working. But from
the business side, it's devastating. When you grab all the
money, you grab all the money with which people buy cars."
   Indeed, auto makers were among the hardest-hit by the
plan. Of the four car makers operating in Brazil -- GM, Ford,
Volkswagen and Fiat -- all but Fiat completely stopped
production for five weeks after the unveiling of the plan,
putting all their assembly-line workers on paid leave. This
week, cars started rolling off again, but at a much slower
pace, and car makers face bleak earnings prospects.
   "We'll try to be a break-even company for the next several
months," Mr. Stone says. "We didn't sell a single car in the
first two weeks after the plan, and then a few cars started
moving," he adds. "We sold about 50% of our normal level of
sales in April {10,000 cars instead of 20,000}, and though
things look a little better now, we're still far from the
levels we had before the plan."
   Multinationals aren't too happy about the freezing of
funds, either. "We were surprised by the extent of the plan
and, like most people, somewhat caught offguard by the
liquidity squeeze," says Monsanto's Mr. Nisbet. He says about
$20 million of the company's money was frozen, forcing
Monsanto to borrow from the bank to pay salaries, think of
new ways to finance its planned investments and impose "an
all-out contingency cost-control plan," Mr. Nisbet says. Now,
he says, "we're within days of a share-and-share-alike talk
with employees, telling them we have to cut wages so as not
to lay off," he says. Like most companies, he says, capacity
has been greatly reduced, and Monsanto "will be nip and tuck
at 50% to 60% capacity to break even."

   Polling Picky Eaters to Boost a Restaurant's Popularity

   Customer Surveys May Help Improve
   Chances in a High-Risk Industry

   CHICAGO -- Restaurant patrons are picky eaters these days.
That's why restaurateurs are spending thousands of dollars
surveying them on their likes and dislikes.
   A case in point is Eurasia, which opened two years ago
just off this city's tony Michigan Avenue shopping district.
Eurasia's Euro-Asian fare drew novelty-cuisine buffs but
turned off the regular lunch crowd. Hoping to find ways to
spur business, Eurasia had researcher Allen H. Kelson, a
former food critic, survey its customers. He found they were
confused by Eurasia's concept and wanted more traditional
Oriental fare at lower prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In response, the restaurant altered its concept a few
months ago; it hired a Thai chef, revamped the menu and cut
prices. A recent survey suggests the makeover's popularity is
rising "off the charts," says Larry Levy, the chairman of
Levy Organization, a diversified real-estate company whose 35
restaurants include Eurasia.
   Oddly enough, Mr. Kelson says he found the results of his
second survey rather "humbling." In his prior career as
publisher and top food reviewer of Chicago magazine, he had
taken Levy Organization to task for refusing to make Eurasia
even more radical. Mr. Kelson -- more pragmatic now that he
has retired his critic's mantle -- admits, "It appears that
Chicagoans are really more conservative."
   Entrepreneurs in restaurants and other fields that have
staggering failure rates are eager for ways to improve their
chances. Some think that hiring a consultant such as Mr.
Kelson is one way to ease the worries that plague them.
   "You're only as good as your last meal," says Michael
Hoffman, owner of Michael's Chicago-Style Red Hots Inc., a
fast-food operator here that retained Mr. Kelson to poll
patrons on food quality and service.
   The pressures on restaurants are aplenty: The number of
new eating establishments throughout the country soared in
recent years. And take-out places, grocery-store salad bars
and microwavable foods make it easier for people to ignore
restaurants entirely. New restaurateurs find it's tougher
than ever to make a go of it, says J. Patrick Kelly, a
marketing professor at Wayne State University in Detroit. And
established owners, particularly those with far-flung empires
of individual restaurants, struggle to keep up, too.
   "It's getting very difficult for me to keep in touch with
our customers," says Richard Melman, the president of Lettuce
Entertain You Enterprises Inc., Chicago, which operates 25
restaurants.
   Mr. Kelson's approach to customer research appeals to Mr.
Melman and others because he involves so many customers. To
start his survey of a restaurant, Mr. Kelson suggests that
the host or hostess hand customers cards inviting them to
participate. Those interested write their names and phone
numbers on the cards; in exchange, the restaurant gives them
some incentive, typically a discount on their next meal
there. Later, telephone interviewers -- supplied by Mr.
Kelson's partner Stanley J. Kapuler, who runs his own
research firm -- call customers for opinions.
   Interviewees who insist they'll never return to a
restaurant -- a liability in an industry that relies on
word-of-mouth business -- are targeted for call-backs by
restaurant owners. Managers then contact them and offer them
a meal on the house. About half accept, says Mr. Kelson. If
an unhappy customer can be turned around on the next visit,
the restaurant will earn "a friend for life," he insists.
   His firm, Customer Satisfaction Systems Inc., in Arlington
Heights, Ill., charges clients up to $3,800 for individual
restaurants and as little as $1,000 an establishment for
large restaurant concerns. He's developing a program for
fast-food chains that will cost each site about $500.
   Mr. Kelson's methods differ from those that many
restaurant owners use. The most common method -- response
cards left on tables or at the checkout -- doesn't work well;
only customers who had extremely bad or good experiences will
fill them out, researchers say. In addition, restaurant
managers have been known to fill them out themselves to
impress higher-ups.
   Researchers say personal interviews with customers can be
even more effective than the telephone queries Mr. Kelson's
company offers. But they're costlier.
   Surveys often reinforce a restaurant operator's gut
instincts on needed changes. At Don &amp; Charlie's American Rib
&amp; Chop House, a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant in
Scottsdale, Ariz., Mr. Kelson found that customers considered
the place dirty. Mr. Kelson didn't see dirt, but Don Carson,
the partner who runs the place, suspected what was wrong. The
restaurant's exterior badly needed painting and its parking
lot needed repaving, but he'd been putting off the required
$35,000 investment. The survey persuaded him to get the work
done -- and the eatery scored well on cleanliness in a later
poll.
   Frequent restaurant-goers tend to have standards in mind
when they approach a new restaurant, say marketing experts.
Surveys can identify those expectations, as happened at Hat
Dance, a Mexican restaurant operated by Lettuce Entertain
You.
   Two years ago, when Hat Dance opened, managing partner
John Buchanan was devoted to offerings unavailable elsewhere
in the city, such as a ceviche bar (which serves raw
marinated fish). But Mr. Kelson's survey found customers came
expecting more familiar fare, such as burritos and
enchiladas. So, Mr. Buchanan added the old standbys to the
menu -- and repeat customers have increased.
   Still, surveys aren't panaceas. "Once a restaurant is
going downhill -- you've tried it and had a terrible
experience -- the likelihood of your going back is remote,"
says Mr. Kelly of Wayne State University.
   For instance, Hopper's Dining Car, another Levy
Organization restaurant in Chicago, was too far gone to be
helped by Mr. Kelson's queries last fall. Situated beside a
movie theater on the basement level of an upscale retail
center, Hopper's did all right at lunch but attracted little
dinner business. Dinner customers, Mr. Kelson says, scored
the place low on all aspects of his survey except noise
level. And on April 30, Hopper's Dining Car closed.

   HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Insurance regulators have asked a state
court to block Safeco Insurance Co. of America's refusal to
renew its 8,000 auto-insurance policies in Pennsylvania.
   Safeco's refusal may be illegal under a 1968 state law
that governs the circumstances that allow an insurer to stop
renewing policies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Safeco, a unit of Seattle-based Safeco Corp., has already
ignored a cease and desist order, issued by the Pennsylvania
Insurance Department last week when it learned that the
insurer was sending out the nonrenewal notices. The insurance
department now wants the court to issue a mandatory
injunction to keep Safeco from canceling its policies.
   Today the insurance department will ask the same court to
preliminarily block Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co. from
canceling its 1,200 policies as they come due.
   Safeco and Harleysville are two of more than 100 insurance
companies that have failed to comply with an auto-insurance
law passed by the Pennsylvania state legislature in February.
Some have asked for permission to raise their auto rates when
they should be lowering them and two companies have tried to
pull out of Pennsylvania entirely.
   Insurers had to file by May 1 a new schedule of auto
insurance premium rates, incorporating the rate rollbacks
mandated by the new law. The law calls for rollbacks of 10%
for all drivers and up to 22% for those who gave up their
right to sue in court except in cases of severe injuries. The
rollbacks are due to begin July 1.
   Robert Casey, Pennsylvania's governor, has asked the
insurance department to explore all legal options to prevent
insurance companies from thwarting the implementation of the
law.
   "We don't intend to sit by while the industry maneuvers
through countless lawsuits, failure to file in a timely
manner and other dilatory tactics to deny policyholders the
rate relief they are entitled to under the law," said
Constance B. Foster, Pennsylvania's insurance commissioner.
   A Safeco official said the company hadn't yet seen any
court papers filed by the insurance department and couldn't
comment.

   OTTAWA -- Canadian housing starts fell 11.9% in April from
March as rising mortgage rates damped housing demand.
   April housing starts declined to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 199,000 from a March rate of 226,000, Canada
Mortgage and Housing Corp., a government agency, said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   April was the first month since February 1988 that the
housing-start rate has fallen below 200,000.
   Annual interest charges on a five-year mortgage have risen
to 14 1/4%-14 1/2% from 12% in January. Each percentage point
rise in mortgage rates has pushed thousands of would-be home
buyers out of the market, said Bill Hopkins, vice president
of the Canadian Real Estate Association. Sales of existing
homes in March fell 22.2% from a year earlier.
   Ontario showed the biggest drop in new housing activity in
April, with urban starts falling 32.5% to an annual rate of
52,000, the lowest level for the province in more than four
years. The number of new single, detached houses in Toronto
that were unsold rose to more than 500 from about 150 in
mid-1989. Actual starts in the city in January-April were
down 44% from a year earlier.

   Clear-Cutting Is Sound

   Despite the assertions in your March 30 page-one article
on the "Forest Crisis," the practice of "clear-cutting" is
the inevitable culmination of sound forestry management.
   In a silviculturally correct forest-management system,
"clear-cutting" replaces natural processes such as insect
infestation, wildfire and old-age decline as the method to
regenerate forest land. "Clearcutting" as it is currently
practiced on federal land and most corporate forest land is
accomplished on an "interdisciplinary basis." Soil
scientists, soil hydrologists, wildlife biologists, fisheries
biologists, silvicultural experts (foresters), botanists and
entomologists all must enmesh their prospective disciplines
to ensure that all resources are conserved during harvesting
and that a clear-cut site will be completely regenerated to a
new stand within five years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Properly practiced clear-cutting absolutely does not
result in the following: "forest crisis, ecological threats,
wastelands, eradicated wildlife habitat, eroded topsoil,
fouled spawning beds, last stroke against biointegrity,
despoiling, ruination of nearby streams, devastation or
lasting damage" as alluded to in your article.

   ---
   Reading your article about the forests of Prince William
Sound, I was struck by an inference increasingly common in
the press that forest clear-cutting is inherently bad.
   Clear-cutting can result in two distinctly different
biological results, depending on where and how it is applied:
reforestation or deforestation.
   In its application to obtain reforestation, it is an
important and valid option. For many tree species where
intensive forest management to maximize forest productivity
is practiced, clear-cutting is used to recover and use all
merchantable timber from a site prior to planting. Often,
planting is the only method of stand regeneration that will
consistently result in restocking with appropriate species
and suitable spacing. In these situations, where cutting is
done according to environmentally sound logging practices, no
significant erosion or site degradation occurs.
   Certain other tree species require large openings in the
forest to reproduce naturally. Many Eastern hardwoods, for
example, fall in this category. Here, again, clear-cutting is
the preferred method of reforestation.
   Where neither planting nor satisfactory natural
regeneration occurs, deforestation is the result of
clear-cutting. Too often, the term "clear-cutting" is
employed where what we really intend to say is
"deforestation."

   The world sure can't look very bright from where Fidel
Castro sits. He has expanded jamming of Radio Marti to 24
hours a day in Havana, up from six. He is devoting
considerable resources to trying to get TV Marti off the
screens. He is even holding a special militia exercise
featuring such devices as spiked booby traps and Molotov
cocktails to stop the predicted invading Yanqui forces. His
commanders warn that this will be a "war of all the people,"
but Castro might be careful how many weapons get into the
people's hands. If there is fighting, it could also be a war
by all of the people and for all of the people.

   Stock prices posted a sixth consecutive gain, but demand
for government bonds eased in the wake of last Friday's big
rally.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.26 to 2721.62 in
light trading. Long-term Treasury bonds gave up modest
amounts of their big Friday gains, and the dollar eased
against most major currencies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said stock prices were buoyed by the perception
that interest rates peaked last week with yields of slightly
more than 9% on long-term Treasury bonds. With the economy
growing modestly and expectations that interest rates will
decline, albeit slowly, in coming weeks, investors have been
buying stocks gingerly.
   Technology issues have performed especially well in recent
days, another sign of confidence among investors that the
economy is on a steady course. Motorola yesterday climbed 1
7/8 to a new 52-week high of 72 1/2.
   While stock market investors were enjoying the possibility
of declining interest rates, bond investors will find little
to enjoy until this week's record $30.5 billion quarterly
auction of new Treasury debt is behind them. The auction
begins today.
   The prospect of such a huge supply of new debt coming to
the market took a toll on bond prices yesterday after an
ebullient rally Friday that carried the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond up more than 1 1/2 points, or more than $15 for
each $1,000 of face amount.
   The rally Friday had its roots in the government's April
employment report, which showed a gain of only 64,000 jobs in
the nonfarm sector instead of the 400,000 or so that many
economists had estimated. The report suggested that the
economy isn't nearly as robust as many had thought and thus
not as likely to produce rising inflation.
   Although some traders said bond prices may decline further
during the auction, they're hoping that the market will get
another boost this Friday when the government reports its
producer price index for April. Although the index, a measure
of inflation at the wholesale level, is expected to be up
0.2%, that small increase comes on the heels of a 0.2% drop
in March and a flat February. Many analysts think the
producer price index is a better measure of future inflation
trends than the consumer price index, which rose 0.5% in
March.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose in thin trading. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange totaled 132.8 million shares. Advancing issues
on the Big Board were ahead of losers 943 to 571.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices dipped modestly. The Treasury's benchmark
30-year issue ended less than 1/4 point lower, or $2.50 for
each $1,000 of face amount. The yield on the issue rose to
8.84%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading the currency was
quoted at 1.6558 marks and 158.19 yen compared to 1.6662
marks and 158.25 yen Friday.

   Dime Savings Bank
   Promotes Parsons
   To Chief Executive

   NEW YORK -- Dime Savings Bank of New York has chosen an
executive with a law background to lead the savings bank
through rough times in the thrift industry.
   Dime named Richard D. Parsons, president of the thrift, to
the added post of chief executive officer. Mr. Parsons, 42
years old, succeeds Harry W. Albright Jr. who will remain
chairman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Like many lenders, Dime is grappling with loan problems,
because of poor underwriting of home loans between 1986 and
1988. But some analysts say that Dime, with $700 million in
tangible capital and continued earnings, is the best
positioned of the big East Coast thrifts to ride out the
storm.
   Some find it surprising that Dime, which has $11.7 billion
in assets, would turn to someone with a background in
corporate law and limited experience operating a thrift to
guide it through this difficult period. Before joining Dime
in 1988, Mr. Parsons was a partner in the New York law firm
of Patterson, Belknap, Webb &amp; Tyler. He formerly served as
counsel to former New York Govs. Nelson A. Rockefeller and
Malcolm Wilson.
   So far, analysts aren't holding the lack of operating
experience against him. Jonathan Gray, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein Co., said: "My first impression has been
quite positive. He's highly intelligent and has a good grasp
of operational and strategic matters. . . . Dime's loan
problems pre-date his arrival."
   Mr. Parsons said that he joined Dime because he was
intrigued by the thought of "rolling up my sleeves" and
running a business: "Many corporate lawyers spend their off
hours wondering what it would be like to have their hands on
the tiller."
   For the next year or two, Mr. Parsons has nothing fancy
planned for Dime. "At the moment, we're husbanding our
capital. We're in a hunker-down mode," he said. "We're the
only one of the five largest New York thrifts in full
compliance with capital requirements."
   Dime isn't merely treading water. Last year, it expanded
in New Jersey buying Star Pointe Bank for $63 million, and
Mr. Parsons would like to add some deposit-taking capability
to its loan offices in Connecticut.
   He says that residential mortgages will remain the
cornerstone of Dime but that the thrift will expand its
unsecured personal loan products, such as checking overdraft
protection, to compete more vigorously with the big
commercial banks. "We intend to provide the full-range of
consumer financial services on both the deposit and credit
sides," he said.
   While Dime has indicated that an $80 million provision for
possible bad loans in last year's fourth quarter will be
sufficient to see it through its problems, analysts aren't so
sure.
   Peter Treadway, an analyst at Smith Barney, says: "They're
not out of the woods yet. I think they'll have to make
another big provision. But Dime has a lot of capital, and its
core earnings are still positive. Every other major East
Coast thrift has severe problems. Dime is the only one that's
going to survive."

   Playboy Plans
   New, Nonvoting
   Class of Shares

   CHICAGO -- Playboy Enterprises Inc. said it plans to
convert its thinly traded common stock into separate voting
and nonvoting classes, a move that would allow it to issue
more shares while preserving founder Hugh Hefner's control of
the company.
   The move will provide management with additional financial
flexibility, the publishing concern said, by permitting
Playboy to use equity for possible future acquisitions,
financings, and employee benefit plans -- without diluting
the voting power of Mr. Hefner's 71% stake.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The plan would also enable the 64-year-old former chairman
and chief executive officer to retain voting control of the
company while disposing of up to three-quarters of his
Playboy holdings.
   All stockholders, "including Mr. Hefner," notes a consent
solicitation being mailed to shareholders, will get
"increased flexibility to dispose of a portion of their
equity interest in the company and otherwise determine the
extent of their equity ownership without necessarily
affecting their relative voting power."
   The document also says Playboy "is not aware of any
current intention by Mr. Hefner to dispose of any portion of
his equity interest in the company." Mr. Hefner is more
likely to dispose of his nonvoting shares than his Class A
stock, "over time," the solicitation says.
   Mr. Hefner, who suffered a stroke in 1985, married a
26-year-old former Playmate last year. His daughter, Christie
Hefner, assumed the chairman and chief executive jobs in late
1988 after serving as president. A spokeswoman noted that Mr.
Hefner has previously made it clear that "it is his intent to
have Christie continue to run the company."
   Dual-class arrangements aren't rare in the publishing
business: founding families of New York Times Co., Dow Jones
&amp; Co., and Washington Post Co., for example, all maintain
voting control through special classes of stock.
   Playboy's recap plan calls for it to carry out a 1-for-2
reverse split of its current shares, reducing the number of
common shares outstanding to 4.7 million from 9.4 million.
Those shares will then be "reclassified" as Class A stock,
each having one vote. The Class A shares will then each pay a
dividend of three shares of non-voting Class B Playboy
shares, which the company will seek to have traded on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Playboy said it and financial adviser Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. believe that the two classes of stock "should
trade at approximately equal prices." Playboy's plan includes
a "minority protection" feature designed to deter would-be
raiders from taking control of the company on the cheap by
purchasing only the voting stock: Any person acquiring more
than 10% of the voting stock must offer to acquire Class B
shares proportionate to their voting-class holdings.
   Although Mr. Hefner's support of the deal appears to make
it a sure thing, holders of record on May 16 will be eligible
to vote on the plan, with implementation scheduled for June
8. The Big Board has advised Playboy that the issuance of
nonvoting stock wouldn't violate restrictions on dual-class
stocks the Big Board adopted in 1988.
   Because Playboy certificates once attracted interest as
potential collectors' items, the company has historically had
a higher-than-average number of single-share stockholders. In
a move Playboy expects to save about $100,000 annually in
servicing costs, those holders won't receive fractional
shares in the reverse split, but will receive a cash payment
based on the price of the stock in the days preceding the
conversion.
   In an interview, Ms. Hefner said she expects the
conversion will enhance the stock's liquidity, and spark
increased interest from institutional holders, who have
largely avoided the thinly traded stock because of its small
"float." Use of the stock in management-benefit plans also
will help attract top executives, she said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Playboy closed at $12.785 a share, up 12.5 cents.

   Overseas Investing Boom Spawns New Wave of Scams

SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)
</IN>
<LP>
   With the growing enthusiasm for investing overseas,
securities investigators report a surge in
international-investment scams.
   "International swindles appear to be the fastest-growing
category of investment fraud that state securities regulators
are now dealing with," says Robert Lam, chairman of the
Pennsylvania Securities Commission.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday, Mr. Lam's office made public a cease-and-desist
order it issued last week against an allegedly fraudulent
Paraguayan cattle investment program. Investors were
solicited to purchase "beef shares," with the promise they
would receive U.S. government bonds in an amount equal to the
purchase price of the shares at no additional cost, the
Pennsylvania Securities Commission said in its
cease-and-desist order. According to investigators, investors
never got the beef shares or the bonds.
   The case shows how convoluted an international investment
fraud can be, Mr. Lam says. "The promoters were in Panama,
the cattle farm in Paraguay, the investors' funds went
through Deutsche Bank, and the sales agent was in
Pennsylvania."
   The sales agent, Earl S. Horne, a Pittsburgh restaurant
manager, denies any wrongdoing. "When I found out it wasn't
legal, I quit selling it," he said in an interview yesterday.
   Like traditional investment frauds, international scams
are usually fashioned on legitimate investments -- including
foreign-currency plays, commodities and futures options,
single-country mutual funds and stocks. Typically, the scam
artists make extravagant claims about possible returns and
often use words like "guaranteed": the investments are sold
via advertisements in leading national and local
publications, by financial planners and insurance agents and
by boiler-room brokers.
   "International investments are hot, and con artists have
really picked up on investor interest in investing overseas,
says Scott Stapf, spokesman for the North American Securities
Administrators, a state securities regulators' group.
   Many crooks are counting on the complexities of
international investing to lull otherwise skeptical
investors. "Many people who invest overseas shut down their
critical faculties; they figure it's supposed to be
confusing," says Mr. Stapf.
   Last fall, for example, state securities regulators closed
down Heritage Financial Asset Management of La Jolla, Calif.,
which claimed to offer certificates of deposit from
Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia. Advertisements that
appeared in retirement publications said that not only would
investors enjoy high money-market rates offered in those
countries, but they would benefit from favorable
currency-exchange rates that would boost returns to 18% or
more. Further, the ads claimed, the investment was "100%
guaranteed by the U.S. government."
   William McDonald, chief of enforcement at the California
Department of Corporations, says that investors received
phony certificates with the names of major banks, including
Citibank, and periodic "interest" payments, but that little
or none of their money was invested. The founder, Jack
Backer, committed suicide last September, he says.
   In January, regulators shut down Eurogold Exchange Ltd., a
purportedly Swiss-based company with an office in Westlake
Village, Calif., that the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission alleges was offering illegal commodity-options
contracts. The investments were sold by financial planners
and insurance agents as a vehicle for tax-deferred income,
says Dennis O'Keefe, CFTC's assistant director of
enforcement.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, at about the same
time, charged Eurobond Exchange Ltd., purportedly a
subsidiary of Eurogold, with fraud. Eurobond sales literature
described in the SEC's complaint said that investor funds
were to be invested in bonds issued by various countries,
including Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Spain and the U.K.
   The president of Eurogold, Gerald Rogers, was sentenced to
10 years by a California court in March for unrelated
activities, and is currently incarcerated in Colorado
awaiting trial on separate charges. He couldn't be reached
for comment.
   "You have to be doubly prudent with international
investing because the problems of enforcement and civil
actions are much more difficult," says Mr. McDonald of
California's Department of Corporations.

   Bond Market Trading Grinds Nearly to a Halt

   NEW YORK -- Bond market trading nearly ground to a halt
yesterday as investors waited anxiously for the Treasury
Department's enormous quarterly bond auction.
   Trading often slows considerably ahead of the multibillion
dollar bond sale, partly because of investor concerns about
the market's ability to absorb such a large supply of new
securities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, the auctions are like big-stakes poker games for
bond dealers who bid against each other to buy the government
paper. For investors, buying bonds before government bond
auctions can be dangerous since prices sometimes gyrate
wildly depending upon how dealers play the game.
   "Nobody wants to make a strong move," ahead of the
quarterly auction, said James R. Capra, a senior vice
president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.
   The Treasury is scheduled to sell $30.5 billion of notes
and bonds this week, the proceeds of which will be used to
refinance Uncle Sam's maturing debt and pay the bills created
by the federal budget deficit. Today, $10.5 billion of
three-year notes will be sold, followed by $10 billion of
10-year notes tomorrow and $10 billion of 30-year bonds
Thursday.
   In trading yesterday, the benchmark 30-year bond ended
less than 1/4 point lower, or $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. The yield rose slightly to 8.84%.
   Bond dealers said the losses reflected profit-taking
during overnight trading in Tokyo that carried over into U.S.
trading. The dealers said prices barely budged the rest of
the day.
   "All of the declines occurred overseas and nothing
happened in the U.S.," said William Sullivan, money market
economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Today's three-year note auction is expected to go
smoothly, with strong demand from individual investors and
from domestic commercial banks. The banks "are flush with
funds and are trying to stay away from troubled {leveraged
buy-out loans} and problem real estate investments. Treasury
securities are plain vanilla, but in this environment they
look more like the Haagen-Dazs of choices," said Robert
Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co.
International.
   Individuals usually buy at auctions through so-called
"noncompetitive bids," which are expected to total as much as
$1.75 billion. That would be up from $1.19 billion at the
last three-year note sale.
   There is mild concern about Japanese participation at the
auction. Mr. Brusca expects the Japanese to buy between 25%
and 30% of the notes and bonds. Their purchases, he said, are
likely to be concentrated in the 10-year and 30-year issues.
   Although Treasury bond yields have eroded since Friday's
bond market rally pushed yields to their lowest levels in
weeks, they are still well above levels at the start of the
year. That should make yields attractive to Japanese
investors, said Mr. Brusca.
   Japanese investors typically are sizable buyers at
Treasury refundings, sometimes purchasing as much as 40%. At
the last refunding in February, Japanese institutional
investors purchased an estimated 30% of the $30 billion of
securities sold.
   In when-issued activity yesterday, the new three-year
notes were quoted at a yield of 8.78%, the 10-year notes at
8.84% and the 30-year bonds at 8.82%.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Canadian government bond market, which has been badly
hurt in recent months, rallied for the third consecutive
session with some issues rising as much as 2 1/4 points.
   Canada's 10.5% benchmark 10-year note was quoted late
yesterday at a price of 96 to yield about 11.17%, up more
than one point from Friday. The benchmark 20-year bond jumped
2 1/8 point to 89.50 to yield 10.76%.
   Some traders warned that the turnaround reflects technical
factors and is not a sign that the market is on the road to
recovery -- at least not yet.
   "We did see some buying in the market, but in no way does
that mean the downward trend is reversing," said Alberto
Franco, a Canadian bond trader at Salomon Brothers Inc. in
New York. He said that while "Canadian bonds seem very
cheap," the securities are likely to fall further in the
weeks ahead until a dispute between the Canadian government
and the province of Quebec is resolved.
   The dispute, which has created jitters in Canada's
financial markets, involves a proposed constitutional
amendment known as the Meech Lake accord. If approved, the
accord, negotiated in 1987, would recognize Quebec as a
"distinct society" within Canada. Many Quebec politicians say
they will seek independence from Canada if the accord isn't
ratified by June 23.
   Analysts said concerns about the Meech Lake accord were
largely responsible for the Canadian bond market's poor
showing. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.'s Canadian bond index
has posted a total return of a negative 7% so far this year.
   Meanwhile, Canadian bond traders say spreads between
active Canadian bonds and comparable U.S. government bonds
will remain wide. Mr. Franco said yields on 10-year Canadian
notes are about 2.40 percentage points higher than yields on
10-year Treasury notes. While that's a little less than a few
weeks ago when the spread was three percentage points, it's
still wider than last year when spreads ranged between one
and 1.5 percentage points.
   In late trading yesterday, Canada's 10.5% benchmark
10-year note was quoted at a price of 96 to yield about
11.17%.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 96 11/32 to
yield 8.84% compared with 96 19/32 to yield 8.81%. The latest
10-year notes ended at 97 19/32 to yield 8.85% compared with
97 24/32 to yield 8.83%.
   The Treasury sold $16.8 billion of bills yesterday at the
government's regular weekly bill auction. The average rate on
new three-month Treasury bills was 7.79% while the average
rate on new six-month bills was 7.84%.
   The average rates were down from last week's auction when
they were 7.91% and 8.03%, respectively.
   Here are details of the Treasury bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Both issues are dated May 10. The 13-week bills mature
Aug. 9, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Nov. 8, 1990.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities came under pressure from rumored sales
by the Resolution Trust Corp. and speculation that the RTC
will liquidate a considerable amount of mortgages during the
current quarter. Active issues ended 1/8 to 6/32 lower.
   There was talk that RTC sold $250 million of Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp. 8 1/2% securities and as many as $300
million of principal-only stripped mortgage securities.
   On Friday, the RTC, the government conservator for failed
thrifts, was rumored to have sold $500 million of mortgage
securities, consisting of about $350 million of Government
National Mortgage Association 9% securities and $150 million
of Freddie Mac 8 1/2% securities.
   The mortgage market was spooked because the RTC has said
it wants to resolve the situation of some 141 thrifts by the
end of the quarter. These thrift resolutions presumably will
mean sizable mortgage-backed sales.
   The prospect of RTC sales comes at time a when the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency is weighing the imposition
of new regulations that would clamp down on bank purchases of
risky derivative mortgage securities. Banks now own an
estimated $100 billion of mortgage derivatives and a share of
those holdings could run afoul of any regulations from the
Comptroller's office.
   Ginnie Mae 9% issue for May delivery ended at 94 14/32,
down 6/32; its 9 1/2% issue at 96 7/8, down 6/32; and its 10%
securities at 99 10/32, down 4/32.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds were mixed, with some issues off as much
as 1/4 point in late dealings and others up as much as 1/4.
   "People have been burned trying to short it {the market}
down here," so there was a little retail interest, said a New
York municipal bond specialist. Whether that buying interest
will be sustained depends on what effect this week's Treasury
auctions will have on the government bond market, he added.
   In light new-issues dealings, a John Nuveen &amp; Co. group
set the preliminary pricing for an issue of $53.7 million
Mississippi Hospital Equipment and Facilities Authority
revenue bonds. The bonds were tentatively priced to yield
from 6.40% in 1991 to 7.62% in 2013.
   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% bonds of 2018 finished 1/4 higher at 96 1/4, yielding
7.51%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Corporate issuers trickled back to the new-issue market
and offered $500 million in new debt.
   General Motors Acceptance Corp., the financing arm of
General Motors Corp., and Unocal Corp. each tapped the credit
markets, separately offering $250 million of new debt.
   In trading, investment-grade corporate issues ended about
1/4 point lower.
   In the junk-bond market, prices of TW Holdings Inc. bonds
rose on what analysts said was a relatively positive earnings
report.
   TW Holdings, a fast-food restaurant operator, reported a
first-quarter loss of $46.1 million compared with a profit of
$8.3 milion a year earlier, but other numbers were more
encouraging. Sam DeRosa-Farag, an analyst at First Boston
Corp., said TW Holdings' sales increased by 7.6% and its cash
flow by 11%.
   TW's 15% 12-year subordinated debentures rose one point to
96 1/2.
   By comparison, most other junk bonds, or speculative-grade
securities with low credit ratings or no credit ratings at
all, were unchanged.

   Business World:
   Inspired From Above, ServiceMaster Dignifies Those Below

CORPORATE PROFILE (PRO)

<LP>
   DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. -- God is acknowledged at
ServiceMaster L.P. That alone would set this international
manager of support-service workers apart from most of
corporate America. But the company credo's devotion to
serving Him is turned toward humanistic ends in trying to
counter alienation afflicting so much of the U.S. labor
force.
   ServiceMaster promises dignity to the janitors,
groundskeepers, launderers and others under its management.
It does so out of a belief, as Chairman and CEO C. William
Pollard puts it, that "every individual is created in the
image of God and has worth." That's why, in the wooden model
that sits on its officers' desks, ServiceMaster has a symbol
for the Deity supporting and balancing blocks representing
profit, achievement and personal growth.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If that sounds like a mixture of Tom Peters and Sunday
school, don't dismiss it. The firm grew sixfold nominally in
the 1980s, combining contracts to supervise support personnel
at hospitals, schools and factories in the U.S. and abroad
with a growing line of care and maintenance services. Margins
on $1.6 billion in operating revenue also have risen, and
though share price has declined since the 1987 crash,
analysts are bullish on it.
   Work force stratification is a common morale problem in
U.S. companies, but ServiceMaster tries to minimize it.
Managers must spend time in their charges' shoes, having
their eyes opened to drudgery and insensitivity. "It's not
uncommon, for example, for the person who's doing the
housekeeping function to never be identified by {even a}
first name, to almost be part of the woodwork," Mr. Pollard
observes. "The doctor comes in to the patient room and talks
to the patient, the nurse comes in . . . they just walk by
them. Unless something goes wrong. Then it's `Pick it up] Get
that spill over there]'"
   Mr. Pollard, 51, tells of his own experience on a
custodial crew. "I'd be working in a busy corridor and I'd
hear people talking about me -- `He looks like a nice man. I
wonder why he's doing this kind of work.' Like I wouldn't be
hearing them."
   A dose of good manners would help, but Mr. Pollard has a
broader notion of the training technique. "We might
categorize it under that broad term empathy." It seems to pay
off in good business, but are the workers happier? The
company says it doesn't keep figures on turnover except at
the manager level (where it's 14% annually), but when Journal
reporter Michael J. McCarthy sought out some on the line two
years ago, they voiced contentment.
   ServiceMaster expects managers to weigh developing of
people along with the company at every turn, and "if they
don't see how they can balance those, then they're maybe not
ready to make that decision," says Mr. Pollard. He admits
fretting over firings can be a problem: "We might be
criticized for delaying our people decisions too long."
   Does this approach work as well in the different cultures?
In all of them, Mr. Pollard says, success "comes down to
basic principles: Most people want to do a good job. If
they're helped in determining what the job is, given the
right tools, recognized for and praised for performance,
they're going to respond. Whether they're in the Bronx, or in
a suburb here, or in Tokyo or Karachi or London." The trick
is to find the right words to get the simple message across
to assorted ears.
   ServiceMaster strives to raise esprit de corps by infusing
the mundane with the humane. "It's not how you mop that
floor, but how you're relating to the patient in bed," says
Mr. Pollard. For instance, a cardiologist might be called on
to express how a tidy and sanitary room enhances recovery
prospects. Soon, "we have housekeepers relating to their task
and saying, hey, I've got something to do with that person
being well. . . . It goes back to saying that person wants to
contribute. That person has value and worth. And that person
really will work better when they understand the value of
their contribution."
   That mantra seems to be effective at the low end. But what
of the middle class, whose anxieties in a corporatized and
computerized economy have been the subject of powerful essays
in recent years by commentators from the left and right? Mr.
Pollard refers to this as the "knowledge worker phenomenon"
and admits, "I'm not sure we've fully identified it." He
recently visited a Memphis call-in center for the company's
termite-inspection business. "That's an intense job]" he
recalls; an on-site supervisor observed that part-time
workers do better at it.
   Work-hour requirements figure also in managerial ranks.
Mr. Pollard has photos of about 150 key associates on a wall
map, a reminder of who "I need to travel with, have to touch.
If you look at that board, there are always four or five in
some kind of crisis." There are also few women. He knows time
demands of those jobs are a major reason, but can offer no
out.
   Home life obviously shapes the whole person, and Mr.
Pollard says he wrestles with how far he ought to intrude.
His wife is pressing him to offer marriage counseling to
employees.
   Mr. Pollard stresses that the credo notwithstanding,
ServiceMaster is not affiliated with evangelical
Christianity. He won't ask everyone on the payroll to live by
the 10 Commandments, and in fact says, "I don't think any of
us can obey" all of them resolutely. Pressed on the matter of
who is held to what standard, he responds that managers --
comprising a third of the 19,000 employees, because they
often supervise non-ServiceMaster workers -- are not free of
obligations off the job. As he puts it, "If a person is
conducting their life in such a way that it's inconsistent
with the right treatment of people -- the person is not
treating his spouse rightly -- it's pretty hard to trust him
in being responsible for people in the company."
   Bad acts, not bad apples is how Mr. Pollard views
problems, however. "Character's not a given in my judgment,"
says the one-time Wheaton College official. "A person isn't a
particular way. They may act a particular way, but the way
they act is a cumulative amount of experiences. The way
they're acting today doesn't have to be the way they act
tomorrow."
   Sometimes pride, though a biblical sin, is a help. "It is
difficult to serve unless they have first succeeded at
something," he says. Recognition isn't necessarily part of
service, and "if that's a hurdle that's been crossed, {they
have the} ability to serve humbly."
   Mixing spiritual and commercial aims is awkward, one
reason why so few big corporations try it. ServiceMaster
encourages an ethic while avoiding a specific moral code to
support it. Going even that far, and designing an
organization that rewards service performance, breaks ground.
As Peter Drucker, high priest of management and an adviser to
Mr. Pollard, puts it in the current annual report,
"ServiceMaster provides a purpose and ultimate objective for
the worker and his or her work, and therefore contributes to
that essential ingredient of dignity that has been lacking in
the past."

   Circle K's Eller
   Quits as Chief
   And Chairman

   Dearth Is Picked to Manage
   Convenience Store Chain
   With `Board Oversight'

   Karl Eller, who built Circle K Corp. into the nation's No.
2 convenience store chain before heavy debt and competition
took it to the brink of collapse, resigned as chairman, chief
executive officer and a director.
   Circle K, based in Phoenix, Ariz., said Robert A. Dearth
Jr., installed by directors as president and chief operating
officer in January, would manage the company with "oversight
from the board of directors acting through William A. Franke,
chairman of the executive committee." Mr. Franke, 53 years
old, led negotiations with Circle K lenders that last month
produced a seven-month moratorium on debt and interest
payments and staved off a filing under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code that the company had said it was
considering.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   During those negotiations, one board member had said Mr.
Eller's departure was likely to be part of any such
agreement.
   The company didn't name a new chief executive to succeed
Mr. Eller, the 62-year-old former builder of media companies
who took the helm at Circle K in 1983. It said Mr. Eller
resigned "to pursue personal business opportunities,"
although it didn't elaborate, and a spokesman said Circle K
and Mr. Eller wouldn't comment further.
   His stepping aside, Mr. Eller said in the Circle K
statement, gives directors "the latitude to establish new
objectives for the future."
   Mr. Dearth, 45, is said by some Circle K directors to have
eclipsed Mr. Eller, with the board's blessing, since coming
on board. Mr. Dearth previously was vice president and chief
administrative officer of United Brands Co., a food concern
controlled by Circle K's controlling shareholder, Cincinnati
investor Carl Lindner.
   The directors have said Eller critics on the board blamed
the chief executive in large part for building Circle K too
fast, taking on an unmanageable debt level and failing to
alert the board of operational problems when they arose.
Several board members, among them outside director John
Harbin, were especially critical of Mr. Eller's retaining of
Steve's Homemade Ice Cream Inc. Chairman Richard Smith as an
unpaid consultant making significant Circle K management
decisions.
   In an interview in March, Mr. Eller conceded that some
board criticism was "rightful," although he generally
defended his own management and said he had always kept the
board informed of Mr. Smith's employment and other matters.
   "I did the best I knew how. Somebody has to be the hero
when you're doing good, and the fall guy when things are
going bad," he said at the time. "I deserve all the credit
and all the woes."
   Mr. Eller, a self-described entrepreneur who has a
graduate school of management and an entrepreneurial center
at the University of Arizona named for him, certainly brought
good times to Circle K in his early years.
   Taking over a 12-state, 1,200-outlet convenience store
operation that dominated the Arizona market but few others,
Mr. Eller began an acquisition binge that helped add 3,500
stores in six years and allowed earnings to skyrocket to a
record $60.4 million for the fiscal year that ended April 30,
1988.
   Critics, however, said management of individual stores
suffered from lack of attention. Competition from stores
operated by oil companies, who could sell gasoline cheaper
than could Circle K, severely hurt both Circle K and
Southland Corp.'s industry leader, 7-Eleven, in recent years.
And debt from Circle K acquisitions swelled to more than $1
billion, from around $40 million when Mr. Eller took over in
1983.
   Losses began cropping up in the past year, and the
company's stock price plunged from a high near $16 a share
last year when the company, for a time, put itself up for
auction. It later took down the for-sale sign when no buyers
stepped forward.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Circle K shares closed at $1.75, up 25 cents.
   While Mr. Eller didn't give details of the personal
business plans he now intends to pursue, he said in the March
interview that he eventually could be interested in joining
the boards of companies in the media industry, which he
describes as his first love.
   Mr. Eller began his career building up an Arizona
outdoor-advertising, broadcasting and publishing company
called Combined Communications Corp., which was merged with
Gannett in the late 1970s. After losing a battle with
Gannett's then-chairman, Allen Neuharth, for the leadership
of that company, Mr. Eller eventually took a job at Columbia
Pictures Industries Inc., where he initiated the talks that
resulted in Coca-Cola Co. purchasing Columbia in the early
1980s.

   The World Health Organization began its annual meeting
yesterday in Geneva facing fresh controversy over moves by
the Palestinian Liberation Organization to gain membership.
   Fathi Arafat, brother of PLO leader Yasser Arafat, will
spearhead new PLO efforts to secure an upgrading of its
present observer status to full membership in the 167-nation
health group. Fathi Arafat, head of the Palestinian Red
Crescent volunteer emergency health service, attended the
opening session of the two-week World Health Assembly.
   The U.S., which provides over a quarter of WHO's annual
budget, has threatened to stop its contributions if the PLO
bid, due for discussion Thursday, is successful. A similar
bid last year failed following strong Washington opposition.
   China's Health Minister Chen Minzhang told the opening
session that global economic problems threatened the health
of large population groups. "In many countries there have
been cuts in health budgets and living standards have
deteriorated," said Mr. Chen, the assembly's outgoing
chairman.
                                                                                                       

   UNDELIVERED GERMAN MAIL
                                                                                                       

   Strikes at West Germany's post office and printing presses
spread yesterday, leaving mail boxes empty, telephone offices
abandoned and many newspapers cut down to skeleton editions.
More than 10,000 postal workers are on strike across the
country to back demands that their hourly work break should
be extended from six to 10 minutes. The strike started last
week. In Hamburg alone, a quarter of a million letters were
left undelivered, the postal workers' union said.
                                                                                                       

   SAVING PERU'S TREASURES
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. has barred importation of archaeological
treasures from Peru in a bid to cut into the illegal sale of
such artifacts, the White House announced. "The United States
believes that the illegal trade in cultural property does
immense damage to our hemispheric cultural heritage," White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. He said the ban was
imposed to help curb looting in the Sipan region of Peru,
following a request from the Lima government.
                                                                                                       

   SETBACK FOR ITALY'S COMMUNISTS
                                                                                                       

   The Italian Communist Party suffered a severe setback in
regional elections, its first nationwide test since the
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. Early projections
showed the party's vote falling to 23.5% in the elections
Sunday and yesterday -- its worst showing for more than 30
years -- from 28.6% during European elections last year and
30.2% in the last regional election in 1985.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ZEALAND MERGER
                                                                                                       

   MCI Communications Corp. of the U.S. and Bell Canada
Enterprises Inc. are merging their New Zealand
telecommunications joint ventures. Last year, MCI formed a
company with New Zealand Railways Corp. and Todd Corp., a
closely held industrial and investment concern. Bell Canada's
Bell Canada International unit set up a separate venture with
Television New Zealand. The new companies were formed after
New Zealand deregulated the telecommunications market to
allow competition with Telecom Corp., the state-owned
telephone company. The government is selling Telecom as part
of a program to raise funds to repay debt.
                                                                                                       

   TURKEY ABANDONS A PROJECT
                                                                                                       

   Turkey abandoned a plan for a Japanese-led consortium to
build a $1 billion thermal-power plant on the Aegean coast.
Turkish enviromentalists had actively opposed the project
since last October, when the consortium was awarded a
contract to build the 1,000-megawatt plant in Aliaga. The
consortium was led by Japan's Electric Power Development Co.
and also included Turkey's state-owned Electricity Authority.
Yesterday's decision came after a major demonstration by
environmentalists in Aliaga.
                                                                                                       

   HONG KONG'S CAPITAL OUTFLOW
                                                                                                       

   Hong Kong's capital outflow surged after the bloodshed in
Beijing June 4, to 22.39 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$2.87
billion) for 1989, Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp.
estimated.
   If that rate persists, local economic growth will be
slowed, the bank said in its April economic report. The bank,
Hong Kong's largest, said there has been mild private capital
outflow since 1984 but that it picked up significantly after
Beijing's bloody suppression of the Chinese pro-democracy
movement last June.
   The bank estimated 1988's outflow to be around HK$2.034
billion and put 1984's at HK$8.949 billion.
   The bank concluded that before the local confidence crisis
is resolved, the capital flight will continue and the
draining of funds from the local economy will continue to
hamper growth.

   West German Nazi-hunters paid $310,000 for information
that led to the capture of Josef Schwammberger, who was
brought back to Germany from Argentina last week and faces
trial on charges of murdering Jews at several camps in
Poland. The bounty, paid to an anonymous informer, is said to
be a record. . . . Two Norwegian skiers reached the North
Pole last weekend after a 500-mile trek that was the first
without dogs, motorized vehicles, or supplies delivered en
route, Norwegian news reports said. Their trip began March 8.

   DRUG TESTING programs escalate at the Transportation
Department.
   Leaping legal hurdles, most of the department's
requirements for testing four million truck and bus drivers,
train crews, mass-transit employees, airline pilots and
mechanics, pipeline workers, licensed seamen and others took
effect in recent months. But court action stalls all transit
and some truck-and-bus and Coast Guard testing rules. Some 8%
to 30% of truck-driver job seekers test positive, firms say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite union lawsuits, Terrance Gainer, the department's
drug-program chief, says he is "absolutely amazed" at
labor-management acceptance. So far, 35,000 tests were also
done on air-traffic controllers and other department people
since late 1987. There were 161 positives; 34 were fired, the
rest were reassigned or returned to duty after
rehabilitation.
   Many transit agencies and others move ahead with testing
on their own, untouched by court orders.
                                                                                                       

   CREATIVE INTERVIEWING takes firmer hold, as the job pinch
worsens.
   Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman, to avoid costly "bad hires" and
emphasize the applicant's future, strives harder to divine
the "real candidate." Hercules begins training managers how
to better assess job seekers' performance prospects. Hershey
Food makes "behavioral interviewing" a crucial part of
management training, so managers can judge "between a fast
horse and a champion" who'll fit Hershey's "culture."
   Negligent-hiring and reference-checking problems also spur
new techniques. Bradley Real Estate Trust uses the behavioral
method now, asking applicants what they'd do to resolve a
real-life work problem. Scott Paper also relies more on
"situational" queries that probe the job-seeker's skills,
judgment and teamwork.
   College grads, with numerous interviews and offers under
their belts, are prepared for interviews, says Hercules.
                                                                                                       

   ILLEGAL ALIENS use phony documents to beat immigration
curbs.
   Though the General Accounting Office says employer
sanctions have cut illegal immigration, they aren't enforced
much for farm workers, insists Philip Martin, an agriculture
expert at the University of California at Davis. False birth,
Social Security and driver's documents proliferate. "We may
have to look at other means to make . . . sanctions work," an
Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman says.
   Employers and unions figure 35% of three million field
workers in major farm states are undocumented, as in the
early 1980s. The INS says arrests along the Mexican border
rose by over 100,000, to 472,121, in the six months through
March, which just means more people are trying -- and
succeeding -- in coming across.
   Texas growers try to check documents. But "when you need
help, you need help," says Joyce Brejcha, whose family grows
corn and peanuts.
                                                                                                       

   SCHOOL CUSTODIANS have a high incidence of
asbestos-related lung disease, a study by the Mount Sinai
Medical Center shows. Fully 28% of 660 New York school
janitors examined had scarred lungs; the general-population
rate is under 1%. Of those with 40 years' work history, 61%
showed serious lung scarring.
                                                                                                       

   APPLEWORKS SOFTWARE draws boos from the Coalition of Labor
Union Women for its word-processing synonyms for "woman,"
such as "female partner . . . wife . . . Mrs.," while those
for "man" include "member of the human race, human, . . .
creature, individual, life, mortal, . . . person, soul, . . .
humankind, mortality."
                                                                                                       

   HEALTH MAINTENANCE organization enrollment grew by 2.1
million members, or 6.3%, in 1989, to 34.7 million, the Group
Health Association of America said. By the end of 1989, 14%
of all Americans were enrolled in an HMO, switching from
traditional indemnity insurance plans.
                                                                                                       

   A 1987 DISSERTATION by a Yale doctoral candidate, finding
little significant risk of lung cancer from passive smoking,
is being sent to 500 scientists by Philip Morris. The tobacco
company hopes to defuse an EPA report expected soon, that the
firm fears will urge a ban on smoking at work.

   SENSITIVITY TRAINING alerts employees to customer needs.
   Staples Inc., an office-supply chain, sent workers from
its New York stores to a two-day motel retreat last month; a
"mystery shopper" reported on their customer-service gaffes.
Employees also played shopper roles, talking about problems
like trying to return an item without a receipt. British
Airways employees see how passengers react, in mock fires and
other mock crises.
   Ritz-Carlton Hotel workers are taught to be more formal
with Japanese and European guests, and to reply to all, "It's
my pleasure," instead of "You're welcome." Parfums Stern
staffers act out customer-salesperson roles, to fathom
customer emotions. Wendy's International videotapes disabled
customers; in one video, a blind person asks that change be
counted out loud.
   Meridian Bancorp. has workers walk with seeds in their
shoes to simulate older customers' corns and callouses.
                                                                                                       

   THE CHECKOFF: A Swedish gas station develops a robot pump
that fills the tank while the driver sits in the car. . . .
It costs about $110,000 to relocate a senior executive, but
only $35,000 for lower-level managers, a survey by consultant
Goodrich &amp; Sherwood shows. . . . Wake up that other guy: In a
poll of 1,000 British Columbia truck drivers, 99.9% said
alertness is vital in their work.

   Big West German Banks Jockey to Seize
   Positions of Strength Across East Border

   A group of off-duty Soviet soldiers watch curiously as a
West German assembly crew uses a crane hoist to fit together
the shiny, container-like pieces of Commerzbank AG's first
East German branch.
   The Halle branch is the first of 50 to be set up by year
end. With monetary union set for July 2, West Germany's three
largest banks are jockeying for position in East Germany's
fertile market for Western-style banking. Sometimes the
contestants can become testy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new branches sprouting in every corner of East Germany
can't open for business until East Germany grants operating
licenses to foreign banks, a move expected well ahead of the
first Monday in July. By that morning, West Germany's major
banks want to open their doors in cities from Rostock to
Dresden to soak up more than 100 billion marks ($60.06
billion) in potential deposits.
   At stake is a new domestic market with enormous growth
potential in retail and, later, investment banking. For West
German banks forced to refinance in their notoriously
overbanked market, unification means expansion at home rather
than increasingly risky ventures abroad.
   East Germany's feeble economy will delay large increases
in bank assets. But bank analysts believe the first few
months will be crucial in securing market shares that can
grow only as West German aid and investment pour into East
Germany.
   So far, it has been an unequal contest. Commerzbank
Chairman Walter Seipp said he was assured earlier this year
by senior officials of East Germany's State Bank that West
Germany's leading banks would be treated equally when
parceling out the State Bank's retail branches for new
tenants from the West. Somehow, it didn't work out that way.
   On April 1, East Germany's bank overhaul broke up the
State Bank's banking monopoly. In the process, the central
bank's operations were separated from commercial and
cooperative banking functions. The move created Deutsche
Kreditbank as the country's leading retail bank.
   The competition among West German banks began as Deutsche
Bank AG nettled rivals by signing a letter of intent with the
newly formed Kreditbank to form a joint venture that would
give Deutsche Bank 100 branches in East Germany. Deutsche
Bank last week announced it plans to have 100 branches up and
running July 2.
   Under the proposed terms of the agreement, Deutsche Bank,
West Germany's largest bank, has a 49% stake in the joint
venture and its 100 branches, with Kreditbank retaining 51%.
A Deutsche Bank official, however, said "this is merely a
transitional arrangement."
   Not to be outdone, second-ranking Dresdner Bank AG
confirmed a week ago that it is angling for a similar
agreement with Kreditbank.
   East Germany's creaky banking system, knowing its chances
to survive independently are slim, has sought alliances with
the big banks in Frankfurt. Analysts reason that when it came
to choosing partners, East German officials instinctively
opted for the largest banks in the field.
   Thus Commerzbank, a distant third in assets, came away
empty-handed. "The competition is pretty intense," said
Thomas Albrecht, a German bank analyst for UBS-Phillips &amp;
Drew. "Commerzbank must be frustrated because Deutsche and
Dresdner will have a presence all over the place, and fairly
quickly."
   Speaking with journalists in Leipzig, East Germany,
Commerzbank's Mr. Seipp aimed a jab at his biggest
competitor, which had been keeping its talks with Kreditbank
under a cloak of secrecy for several months.
   "At first glance, it might look like Deutsche Bank is
getting a faster start," Mr. Seipp said. "But if you look at
the former buildings of the State Bank that they're getting,
I'm not so sure. The old buildings can be a deterrent for
many customers, who could be reminded of the old system. We
can offer them a fresh start."
   Commerzbank's Horst Ahrens is happy with the company's
progress in Halle. "We are glad to have so much space in
front of the bank," said Mr. Ahrens. "On July 2, we'll
probably have thousands lined up in front."
   A Deutsche Bank official isn't so sure. "It doesn't hurt
to be optimistic," he said, adding, "This is going to be a
very difficult process. We are literally starting at zero."
   Many of Deutsche Bank's future branches are in desperate
need of a facelift. Down the street from the pile of
containers that are four weeks away from becoming a new
Commerzbank outlet, a soot-covered Deutsche Kreditbank branch
doesn't gain in charm as one enters a foreboding, ill-lighted
lobby.
   After 40 years of rigid central planning, East German
enterprises have little in their books that approximates
Western accounting standards. Most companies have never had
to balance both sides of a ledger, and their fixed assets
often were artificially inflated as part of the socialist
success formula.
   Said Commerzbank's Mr. Seipp: "We simply can't apply our
own standards on assessing creditworthiness. We will have to
work on trust."

   Ex-Bear Stearns Official Is Indicted
   For Obstructing Money-Laundering Probe

   NEW YORK -- A federal grand jury indicted a former senior
managing director and former head of Bear Stearns Cos.'s
stock-loan department for allegedly obstructing the
investigation of a money-laundering case.
   The indictment, handed up late last week against the
former Bear Stearns executive, Joseph J. Stella, appears not
to be directly related to the wide-ranging federal
investigation of stock-loan abuses on Wall Street that
surfaced in September. Bear Stearns wasn't involved in the
alleged wrongdoing in the money-laundering case.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stock-loan branches of big securities firms for a fee lend
blocks of securities to investors and institutions, as well
as match lenders and borrowers of stock. About $25 billion of
stock was lent last year, according to industry executives.
   As a senior executive who headed Bear Stearns's stock-loan
department for the past 15 years, Mr. Stella would be well
versed in Wall Street's secretive and lucrative stock-loan
business, attorneys said. A broad investigation being
conducted by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office centers on
the former head of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s stock-loan
operations, Dennis T. Palmeri, who is believed to be
cooperating with federal investigators, people in the
securities industry said. Shearson is a unit of American
Express Co.
   In last week's indictment, the Manhattan federal grand
jury charged that in 1980 and 1981 Mr. Stella and several
others "laundered" more than $1.7 million in checks that
allegedly reflected the proceeds of securities embezzled from
Bankers Trust Co. and fees from stock-loan transactions that
others sought to shield from income taxes. Bankers Trust is a
unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp.
   The indictment charged that Mr. Stella and several others
-- including his brother, Fred Stella -- conspired to conceal
from prosecutors and the grand jury their involvement in the
check laundering and income-tax evasion during an
investigation of the Bankers Trust case that began in 1983.
   Although the indictment alleges that the defendants
laundered the cash, they were only charged with counts
relating to obstructing the investigation.
   Joseph Stella, who resigned from Bear Stearns last month,
couldn't be reached for comment; his attorney didn't return
phone calls.
   In a statement, Bear Stearns said it accepted Mr. Stella's
resignation on April 26 "for alleged personal activities
totally unrelated to Bear Stearns." Bear Stearns said that
was the day Mr. Stella told the firm of his possible
indictment. On the same day, Bear Stearns named Pasquale
CeStaro III as the managing director in charge of its
stock-loan area.
   In addition to Joseph and Fred Stella, the indictment
named Roger C. Capozzi Sr. and Joseph A. Pontarelli, who
allegedly cashed checks for Fred Stella through a Brooklyn
clothing-embroidery business and a Manhattan liquor store and
check-cashing business, respectively, the indictment says.
Fred Stella and Messrs. Capozzi and Pontarelli couldn't be
reached for comment.
   The indictment alleges, among other things, that Mr.
Capozzi and Joseph and Fred Stella falsely told investigators
that fictitious or deceased people were responsible for
crucial aspects of the money-laundering activities.
   Mr. Capozzi and Joseph and Fred Stella were each charged
with one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice; Mr. Capozzi
also was charged with three counts of perjury and three
counts of obstructing justice. Fred Stella was also charged
with five counts of obstructing justice. Mr. Pontarelli was
charged with filing a false income-tax return and with
income-tax evasion.
   If convicted, Joseph Stella, 46 years old, faces a maximum
of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine; Fred Stella, a
50-year-old New York lawyer, faces a maximum of 30 years in
prison and fines of $1.5 million.
   Mr. Capozzi, 68, faces a maximum of 35 years in prison and
fines of $1.75 million. Mr. Pontarelli, 47, faces a maximum

   NEW YORK -- In a sign of the continuing profit pressures
on government bond dealers, the head of Citicorp's government
bond operation and the chief trader resigned.
   In an internal memo, Citicorp last week said that David A.
Jones, who headed the bond operation, and Lawrence Isabel,
the chief trader, had resigned to pursue other interests.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The resignations came as Citicorp divided the unit and
reassigned responsibilities. The U.S. government securities
portion of the bond unit was combined with foreign exchange
and hedging instruments under David Young, division executive
for exposure management. Henry Mlynarski was named head of
trading and sales of U.S. government securities. Municipal
securities and certain other instruments were placed under
Robert Laughlin, formerly division executive for equipment
finance and leasing.
   Michael A. Callen, Citicorp vice chairman, said in an
interview that government bonds "continue to be a real tough
business." He spoke highly of Messrs. Jones and Isabel,
calling them "first-rate."
   Neither Messrs. Jones nor Isabel could be reached for
comment.
   In recent months, Citicorp, like other primary dealers,
has scaled back its bond trading in the face of slim margins
and continued high costs.

   MADRID -- Spanish state-industry official Miguel Aguilo is
expected to be named soon as chairman of Iberia, Spain's
national air carrier.
   Company officials confirmed that Iberia's current
chairman, Narcis Andreu, will leave shortly to become
chairman of the Belgian subsidiary of state-controlled Banco
Exterior de Espana.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sources at Instituto Nacional de Industria, or INI, the
state holding company that owns Iberia, said Mr. Aguilo is
expected to be appointed to the Iberia post later this month.
The changeover is expected to take place after an Iberia
shareholders' meeting in June.
   Mr. Aguilo, 45 years old, has run INI's shipbuilding
division for the past three years, boosting orders
substantially and helping to cut the division's losses to 23
billion pesetas ($220 million) last year, a 25% narrowing
from 1988.
   Known as a competent manager with a gift for teamwork, Mr.
Aguilo is close to Spain's ruling Socialist Party. Before
joining INI, he held various posts in enterprises run by the
Madrid regional government, including the chairmanship of the
Madrid water company, Canal de Isabel II.
   At Iberia, he will have to tackle the challenges posed by
increased competition in Europe's aviation market at a time
of weakening demand for tourist flights to Spain.

   LOS ANGELES -- Medco Research Inc. said it fired its
director of research and medical affairs, Dr. William C.
Govier, Friday.
   The company also said Dr. Govier and the company had been
named as defendants in a lawsuit filed by two shareholders
alleging that he violated securities law when he sold stock
in the company in March. In April, the company said an
investment-banking firm had been pursuing the potential sale
of the concern but that several prospective buyers weren't
interested. It said it was continuing to explore the sale of
the company, and said it had been forced to issue a news
release because of rumors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Sanford J. Hillsberg wouldn't say whether
Dr. Govier's departure was related to the suit. Dr. Govier
joined the company in 1987, and signed a new one-year
contract March 1. He couldn't be reached. Prior to joining
Medco, Dr. Govier was director of pharmaceuticals research
and development at Du Pont Co.
   Separately, two New York investment partnerships disclosed
in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that they hold
a 5.46% stake in Medco. The two funds, EGS Associates Limited
Partnership and EGS Partners Limited Partnership, are managed
by two former securities analysts specializing in
pharmaceuticals and chemicals companies.
   Medco develops treatments and diagnoses of cardiovascular
diseases, and last year won federal approval for Adenocard, a
new drug. "We like its products," said EGS general partner,
Joseph Salvani.

   Technology:
   Lotus Spreadsheet
   To Accomodate
   Microsoft Program

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp. said it will
develop a future version of its best-selling 1-2-3
spreadsheet to run with Microsoft Corp.'s next version of
Windows.
   Analysts viewed the announcement as acknowledgment by
Lotus that the Windows program of archrival Microsoft is
becoming popular with customers. "It's a concession by Lotus
that the groundswell for Windows is pretty strong," said
David Readerman, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lotus had previously downplayed the role of Windows, a
program that allows many different programs to work together
in a single computer and share some features such as
pull-down menus of instructions. But Microsoft is expected to
unveil its next version, Windows 3.0, on May 22 in New York
and many customers who have seen the product are raving about
its power. Windows has a graphical user interface, like Apple
Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, that includes icons and
overlapping windows to make the computer easier to use.
   Lotus also introduced a new version of its existing 1-2-3
Release 3.0 product called Release 3.1 that provides improved
capabilities for printing out spreadsheets and also offers
many graphics features. The new version, which will be
available in the third quarter, will work with Windows, but
won't take advantage of all of Windows' capabilities.
   Frank Ingari, a Lotus vice president, said that the
decision to add the Windows version sometime in the future
reflected requests from Lotus customers. However, he
predicted that Release 3.1 will become the standard product
for users who want advanced spreadsheet capabilities.
   Analysts were impressed with the printing and graphics
technology of Lotus's new Release 3.1. Lotus acquired it from
Aleph 2, a Paris software developer. Terms weren't disclosed.
"My guess is that Lotus users will adore this product," said
Jeffrey Tarter, publisher of SoftLetter, a Watertown, Mass.,
newsletter.
   However, "I see the market being a little confused," by
all the different 1-2-3 products, said Richard Sherlund, an
analyst with Goldman Sachs. And Robert Therrien of
PaineWebber Inc. said that "there's so much hype surrounding
the productivity gains from using Windows that this will be
greeted by a lot of people as ho hum."
   Analysts said that Release 3.1 should sell better than its
predecessor, the long-awaited Release 3.0 that went on sale
last June. Partly due to its limited printing capabilities,
Release 3.0 has accounted for only about 25% of Lotus 1-2-3
sales since then. Release 2.2, a more limited version that
has better printing ability, costs $100 less and is usable on
smaller personal computers, has been Lotus's big seller since
last summer.
   Release 3.1, like Release 3.0, will sell for $595.
Existing Release 3.0 users can upgrade for $35.

   WASHINGTON -- The Justice and Commerce departments
proposed legislation offering companies involved in joint
production ventures reduced risk of antitrust action by the
government.
   The bill would require the courts to consider such
economic benefits as reduced production costs and increased
competitiveness with foreign industries before concluding
that joint ventures violate antitrust laws. It also would
reduce antitrust liability to single damages from treble
damages for companies involved in such cooperative ventures,
provided the companies clear the joint ventures in advance
with the government.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the legislation
would be especially helpful to high-technology industries,
although he declined to cite any examples. "It's going to
work across the broad spectrum," he said. Mr. Mosbacher added
that the bill would help U.S. industries battle foreign
competition, especially from Japan and Europe.
   In 1984, Congress reduced antitrust liability for
companies involved in joint research and development
projects. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), a co-author of
that legislation, said that extending the protection to
manufacturing carried the approach too far. He added that the
new proposal "would do little to improve America's
competitiveness and would do much to undermine the laws that
promote competition."

   IRVINE, Calif. -- Fluor Corp., which holds a 57.5% stake
in Doe Run Co., said it agreed to pay $125 million to acquire
the rest of the company from Homestake Mining Co.
   Homestake said the sale of its 42.5% interest in the lead
production company would result in after-tax proceeds of
about $95 million and a net gain of about $40 million. The
sale, contingent only upon government approval, is expected
to close this summer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the joint ownership arrangement, most decisions
required approval of both partners. "The sale will resolve
differences of opinion about the direction of the business,"
said Harry M. Conger, Homestake chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Doe Run, based in St. Louis, is the largest integrated
lead producer in North America, with about a 60% share of the
U.S. market, Fluor said. Last year, Doe Run posted $68
million in operating profit on $260 million of revenue.
   Full ownership "increases the strategic options
available," said Fluor's chief executive officer, Les G.
McCraw. For example, Doe Run is expected to expand its
activities in the recycled lead market, a spokesman said. The
largest market for both new and recycled lead is automobile
batteries.
   Fluor is an engineering and construction concern with
investments in lead and coal. Homestake, based in San
Francisco, is a gold-mining company with interests in the
U.S., Australia, Chile and Canada.

   Wesray Fades Along With LBO Market
   ----

   NEW YORK -- Wesray Capital Corp. ushered in the 1980s boom
in leveraged buy-outs with its spectacularly profitable
purchase of Gibson Greetings Cards Inc.
   Now the LBO era is waning, and so is Wesray.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wesray bought Gibson Greetings for $80 million in 1982.
Sixteen months later, it took the card company public. Wesray
equity investors who put up just $1 million of the purchase
price reaped $100 million.
   Soon after the Gibson profits became widely known, big
securities firms rushed to set up buy-out departments. The
imitators hoped to repeat the success of Wesray and others in
leveraged buy-outs.
   But Wesray's presence has shrunk to a whisper. Former
Treasury Secretary William E. Simon, a co-founder of the
firm, quit in 1987. "The bloom is off the rose," Mr. Simon
said then, implying that he thought the LBO business had
peaked.
   More recently, Wesray's other co-founder, Raymond
Chambers, has effectively pulled out of the firm. People who
know Mr. Chambers said he is spending nearly all of his time
on charitable work, including a tutoring program for poor
children in Newark, N.J.
   Mr. Chambers's loss was probably more crucial. Gibson
Greetings' financial vice president, Ward Cavanaugh, said,
"Most of our contact was with Ray Chambers." While Mr. Simon
didn't shirk financial details, he was known mostly for his
wide network of business contacts.
   Messrs. Simon and Chambers timed their exits nicely. In
their final year together at Wesray, they ranked among the
400 richest people in the U.S., with personal fortunes
estimated by Forbes magazine at $200 million each. Since
then, the buy-out business has wilted, first because of
intense competition and more recently as a result of a
widespread aversion to leverage and high-yield junk bonds.
The two men declined to comment.
   Wesray's remaining executives still are making money from
buy-outs, but they are pursuing much smaller deals than the
$600 million purchases that Wesray carried out at its peak.
The firm completed five small buy-outs last year, of which
only one, the $70 million acquisition of Aladdin's Castle
Inc., was publicly announced.
   People who have seen Wesray's current portfolio say the
firm has averaged a 70% annual return on 19 buy-outs since
the start of 1987. That's a strong showing, but down
significantly from Wesray's triple-digit returns of the early
1980s.
   Wesray stumbled with the 1988 buy-out of Simplicity
Pattern Co., which last summer said it couldn't pay interest
on the junk bonds that helped finance its buy-out.
"Simplicity's equity is worthless, and its bonds are probably
worth five to 10 cents on the dollar," said Julian Schroder,
an analyst at R.D. Smith &amp; Co. Simplicity officials declined
to comment.
   As business slows at Wesray, some of its younger
investment bankers, who haven't made Simon-size fortunes yet,
are jumping ship. A Wesray vice president, John Howard, and
two lower-level dealmakers recently quit and joined Vestar
Capital Partners Inc., another New York buy-out group in
which Wesray has a minority investment. Last year, Vestar
completed five buy-outs, and bank lenders regard it as more
active than Wesray.
   In its prime, Wesray scored its biggest successes by using
very high leverage, shrinking common equity well below the
10% level that other buy-out groups favored. It wasn't
unusual for common equity to be as little as 1% of a
buy-out's total price. The rest of the money was borrowed or
provided by preferred stock.
   "The Wesray formula was great for a few years," said
Gerard Kennell, treasurer of Avis Rent-a-Car. Avis was
acquired by Wesray in a 1986 buy-out in which less than 7% of
the purchase price was equity. The buy-out was a typical
Wesray success. It produced profits of more than 20 times the
equity invested. "But it's become harder to do those kinds of
deals," Mr. Kennell said. "Banks are looking for a lot more
equity" before they finance such a transaction.
   While Wesray President Frank Richardson and Chairman Frank
Walsh declined to be interviewed, one major Wesray investor
denies market rumors that the firm is thinking of closing its
New York office or disbanding. "That's not true at all," said
this investor, who declined to be identified. "Some fellows
are taking an active role at Vestar, which we regard as part
of the same family. Everyone else in our New York office will
remain. The New Jersey office has had, and will continue to
have, more people," he said. (Wesray has dual headquarters in
New York and Morristown, N.J.)
   Still, indications are that Wesray is switching its focus
away from the once-glamorous LBO area. Instead, it may opt
for duller but more conventional types of investing. Wesray
has only its own executives' money to invest; it never raised
a buy-out fund from outside investors.
   "Wesray is likely to diversify its investments over time,"
the Wesray investor said. Among the firm's possibilities are
looking for profits in depressed junk bonds, taking minority
equity positions in companies, and hiring outside managers to
invest some of the Wesray partners' money. "It's a business
that will go through a number of chapters," the Wesray
investor said.
   In fact, some people think Wesray's retreat may be the
smartest way to deal with the new anti-leverage climate.
"Their returns have always been stupendous -- some of the
best in the business," said Domenic Baione, a lender at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. "Whatever else happens,
they've had a great run."

   Investing in Spinoffs
   Offers an Advantage

   VENTURE capitalists seeking safer investments may have
more corporate spinoffs to consider.
   Elron Electric Industries Ltd. says it is negotiating to
raise $14 million from international venture funds to finance
some small high-tech companies and projects it has been
developing in the U.S. to spin off.
   The companies include Rosh Intelligent Systems Inc., a
Needham, Mass., designer of artificial intelligence software,
and Chip Express Corp., a Santa Clara, Calif., start-up
planning to exploit chip design technology developed by
Elron, a holding company based in Haifa, Israel.
   The capital will "ensure the continued funding of these
ventures and also allow investments in newer projects," says
Uzia Galil, Elron's chairman.
   Companies are turning to spinoffs because they make sense
for both sides. Corporations get a new source of equity and
the investor gets a safer investment. The parent company has
already paid for most of the research, development and
testing, says Mark Radtke of Advent International, a Boston
venture-capital firm. "The technology and financing risks
have been drastically reduced. You can see what you're paying
for."
   Advent recently invested in Biotage Inc. of
Charlottesville, Va., an Aluminum Co. of America Inc. spinoff
that makes equipment for pharmaceutical and biochemical
companies. "We felt the technology could be better brought to
market by an independent company that focused solely on this
business," Mr. Radtke says.
                                                                                                       

   Magnetic Cards Attract
   Small-Business Owners
                                                                                                       

   SMALL COMPANIES are charging into the magnetic card
business.
   Payment Systems Development Corp. of Fairfax, Va., is
launching a prepaid electronic card allowing users to make
purchases at specially equipped vending machines and
fast-food outlets. The credited amount is paid in advance;
the balance decreases as purchases are made.
   The card's users -- initially University of Maryland
students and professors -- get discounts from some vendors,
as well as credit-card convenience.
   "The business already has proven itself in France and
Japan," says Greg Gregory, president of Payment Systems.
   Smart Card Solutions Inc., Atlanta, is introducing its
version of a card for Murray State University in Murray, Ky.
   Sophisticated magnetic cards in combination with advanced
data-processing techniques are providing other business
opportunities for small firms.
   In Sarasota, Fla., Automated Shipping Machines Inc. has a
machine allowing consumers to ship letters and packages
without having to trudge to a remote shipping outlet or post
office. Users choose how fast to have a package delivered and
get their magnetic credit cards to charge the transaction.
The machine dials the card issuer for authorization,
processes the transaction and calls the appropriate shipper
to arrange the pickup.
                                                                                                       

   Recession Is Unlikely,
   Entrepreneurs Say
                                                                                                       

   SMALL COMPANIES -- which are believed to be most sensitive
to economic shifts -- don't see a recession looming.
   More than 55% of small-company owners surveyed by Cicco &amp;
Associates Inc., a Murrysville, Pa., consulting group, say
they don't expect a recession within the next 12 months.
   Nearly 30% say they expect some sort of recession, and
about 15% say they are uncertain.
   "It looks like the strength of the economy is running
deeper than previously thought," says John Cicco Jr.,
president of the consulting concern. "If a recession is
coming, small companies aren't picking it up."
   But two groups are significantly less optimistic than
others: owners of companies with 20 or fewer employees, and
female owners. Both were evenly split on the likelihood of a
recession.
   The survey also indicates where small companies would cut
spending in case of a recession: Of 14 industries that serve
small businesses, the hotel and investment industries would
be the most affected, followed by the office equipment,
credit card, airline, car rental, telecommunications and
advertising industries. Accounting firms would feel the least
effect.
                                                                                                       

   Two Executive `Clubs'
   Stop Their Wrangling
                                                                                                       

   THE END has come for a squabble between two national
associations of small-company executives.
   Officials of the two New York groups -- the American
Management Association and the Center for Entrepreneurial
Management Inc. -- say they settled a legal tussle over a
membership list. Last year, giant AMA sued tiny CEM in a
local state court to bar it from alleged wrongful use of the
list naming 2,000 executives in the AMA presidents group.
CEM, formerly part of AMA, has 350 members in its Chief
Executive Officers Club. The court had temporarily banned CEM
from using any confidential list or trade secret of AMA. CEM
then filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code to
protect itself against further legal costs.
   But AMA drew criticism for its legal attack. Daniel
Pecora, president of a Chicago brush company, says: "I don't
see the need for a big organization to stomp on a small
organization." He got out of the AMA. Thomas Horton, AMA's
chairman, concedes some members deserted over the issue.
   Joseph Mancuso, CEM's president, says his group expects to
emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings now that the dispute has
been resolved. Mr. Mancuso denies any wrongdoing by CEM.

   LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co. said that
first-quarter net income fell 22% but that operating profit,
exclusive of one-time items, rose 10%.
   The Los Angeles-based oil company -- periodically an
aggressive buyer of its own stock -- also said it repurchased
2.1 million common shares in the first quarter for $232.3
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The repurchases reduced Arco's total stock and stock
equivalents outstanding to 166.2 million shares at March 31,
down 1.2% from 168.3 million at Dec. 31, 1989, and off 5.9%
from 176.6 million shares at Dec. 31, 1988.
   Net fell to $547 million, or $3.28 a share, from $704
million, or $4 a share, a year earlier.
   The latest period included a $323 million, or
$1.94-a-share, gain from a change in accounting for income
taxes, offset in part by charges of $233 million. The charges
included provisions for taxes, anticipated environmental
cleanup costs, and early debt redemption.
   The year-earlier period included a $634 million, or
$3.60-a-share, gain from the sale of stock in a subsidiary,
partly offset by $345 million in charges for future
environmental and other expenses.
   Revenue climbed 6.4% to $4.22 billion from $3.96 billion.
The number of average shares, on which the per-share profit
is calculated, fell to 166.9 million from 176.1 million a
year earlier.
   Lodwrick M. Cook, chairman and chief executive officer,
said operating profit rose to $457 million from $415 million
a year earlier.
   Mr. Cook attributed improved operating results to higher
crude oil prices, higher refined product prices, and to
increased natural gas sales.

   PINE BROOK, N.J. -- Cistron Biotechnology Inc. emerged
from Chapter 11 proceedings after nearly two years under the
protection of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Newark.
   The biotech company reached an agreement to discharge
nearly $1.4 million of liabilities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under terms, the company will issue $870,238 of notes plus
nearly 1.1 million of its shares to satisfy claims of its
attorneys and of New England Medical Center Hospitals Inc.
The company and New England Medical have an accord to
research Interleukin-1, a natural protein being developed as
a drug for treating arthritis and other problems.
   Cistron Chairman Henry Grausz guaranteed the notes; in
return, he will receive nearly two million Cistron shares.
   The company also will issue options to buy 640,000 Cistron
shares to satisfy claims of present and former directors and
employees. Other creditors will get 100 cents on the dollar.
   The company had 21.3 million shares outstanding at
year-end 1989. In the second quarter ended Dec. 31, the
company earned $34,400 compared to a year-earlier loss of
$14,300. Sales rose 23%, to $271,000, from $220,000.
   The company's shares have been trading on the pink sheets.
It will apply to have the shares listed over the counter, a
spokesman said.

   NEW YORK -- ITT Corp. became Western Union Corp.'s second
largest owner in late March.
   Western issued an additional 7.8 million shares, or 9.02%,
of its common stock to ITT under terms of its December 1987
agreement to purchase ITT World Communications Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That agreement said that if Western Union's stock fell
below $2.05625 a share at Dec. 31, 1989, ITT would receive
the difference between $2.05625 and the market value of the
stock multiplied by 6,565,350.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Western Union closed at 56.25 cents, up 6.25 cents.
   The new shares raise ITT's stake in Western Union to
16.58% of its 86.8 million shares outstanding and 7.8% of
voting rights in the beleaguered telecommunications company.
That is second to Western's largest shareholder, New York
financier Bennett S. LeBow, who owns 43.4% of Western's
common, or 46.4% of its voting rights.
   "This is purely pursuant to our 1987 agreement," said a
Western spokesman. "This is not ITT buying additional
shares."
   Actually, ITT's new status could be short-lived if a
recent plan by Western to restructure its debt wins approval
from shareholders. Western wants to swap its existing debt
securities for new notes and to increase its common
outstanding to 368 million shares. This would shrink ITT's
stake to about 3.9%.

   Ingersoll Extends
   Junk Bonds Offer
   For a Second Time

   NEW YORK -- Faced with a continuing boycott by
bondholders, Ingersoll Newspapers Inc. extended for the
second time in two weeks its tender offer to holders of an
affiliate's junk bonds.
   The latest extension is raising questions about whether
the company, which is controlled by Ralph Ingersoll II, may
be forced to sell more of its newspaper properties to avoid
default on its heavy debt load.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Through his various companies, Mr. Ingersoll sold 10
newspapers in January to pay off bank debt, has other
newspapers up for sale, and on April 25 closed the St. Louis
Sun. The metropolitan newspaper cost him at least $25 million
since its launch last September.
   More than likely, Mr. Ingersoll will be forced to sweeten
his offer to as much as 80% or more of the bonds' face value;
the bonds have traded, in small volume, between 55% and 60%.
Ingersoll Newspapers is attempting to buy back about $240
million of junk bonds at a deep discount to their face value.
Ingersoll offered 55% for the senior bonds and 25% for the
junior bonds.
   Mr. Ingersoll's Community Newspapers Inc., issuer of the
bonds, publishes daily newspapers in Ohio, Connecticut, New
Jersey, Rhode Island and New York. Mr. Ingersoll has
attempted to buy Community's bonds through his other holding
company, Ingersoll Newspapers. Mr. Ingersoll controls the
various companies, including a newspaper company in Britain,
through Ingersoll Publications Co., based in Princeton, N.J.
   Bondholders, who total fewer than 35 institutions, have
once again organized a total boycott of Mr. Ingersoll's
offer. Since no bondholder accepted the offer for 13% "reset"
bonds and discount debentures by midnight EDT last Friday,
Ingersoll said it will extend the offer to 12:01 a.m. EDT
Saturday.
   Ingersoll, however, said Community Newspapers will, at the
request of bondholders, begin discussions for the first time
with them about the tender offers.
   It is uncertain whether such talks will result in
substantial changes in the tender offer. Ingersoll executives
wouldn't comment and executives from Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.,
which is managing the offer, couldn't be reached for comment.
   According to some bondholders, Chase Manhattan Bank is
funding Ingersoll's tender offer. A Chase spokesman, however,
would say only: "Chase is continuing to have discussions with
Ingersoll about financing. We are having discussions on a
variety of Ingersoll's financing needs."
   With each extension of the tender offer, Mr. Ingersoll's
newspaper company nears an important deadline -- July 7. By
that date, Mr. Ingersoll must have reset interest payments
for about $125 million of the bonds to make up for the drop
in the bonds' price.
   The bondholders are well organized and so far have
remained unified, hoping to force changes in the tender
offer. Bondholders object not only to what has been referred
to as Mr. Ingersoll's "low-ball price," but also to the
structure of the offer. James Rubin of Sass Lamle Rubin &amp;
Co., has said, under the offer, bonds outstanding would have
severely reduced protective covenants that would render them
worthless in certain scenarios.
   According to bondholders, the group has retained Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. as independent advisers. Smith
Barney, which couldn't be reached for comment, is expected to
advise the bondholders on the values of Mr. Ingersoll's
newspaper properties.

   Toronto Officials Weigh Zoning Change
   That Could Hurt Canadian Pacific Unit

   TORONTO -- Toronto's city council last night began a
debate that could hamper Canadian Pacific Ltd.'s 750 million
Canadian dollar (US$645 million) spinoff of its real estate
unit, Marathon Realty Co.
   A resolution before the council calls for changing the
zoning of about 200 acres of prime undeveloped land -- some
of which is owned by Marathon -- footsteps away from
Toronto's financial district. The motion seeks to reduce by
as much as 75% the amount of commercial building space
permitted for the site, where 15 million square feet of
commercial building space is currently permitted. Also, the
number of housing units on the land would be doubled.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Marathon owns about 35 acres of the affected land in a
parcel called Southtown, and it plans to develop, among other
things, as much as six million square feet of office space
over the next 10 to 15 years.
   Canadian Pacific is spinning off 80% of Marathon through a
share distribution to CP's shareholders. CP will retain the
other 20% of Marathon. Upon distribution, Marathon would have
about 99 million shares outstanding, making it Canada's most
widely held public real estate company. Marathon's shares are
expected to begin trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange
within the next two weeks.
   Donald King, president and chief executive officer of
Marathon, said in an interview that a vote supporting the
motion to revise the zoning of the undeveloped land would
jeopardize the company's current plans to develop its 35-acre
site. Analysts said that could depress the company's stock
price, making it a potential takeover target.
   Fred Ketchen, vice president of equity trading at
Toronto-based Scotia-McLeod Inc., said there has been
substantial interest in Marathon stock by both buyers and
sellers since "gray-market" trading began April 25. In
gray-market trading, investors promise to buy or sell the
stock at certain prices when the stock is listed.
   More than 2.1 million Marathon shares traded in the gray
market Friday as the stock closed down 12.5 Canadian cents to
C$7.38. Marathon rallied in gray-market trading yesterday and
by late afternoon was at C$7.63 to C$7.75 in brisk trading.
   "There is an increasing likelihood that someone could take
a run at Marathon, especially if the stock continues trading
at an obscene discount to net asset value," said Brad Smith,
analyst at Toronto-based Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc.
   Mr. Smith estimates that Marathon has a net asset value of
C$20 to C$21 a share, in large part due to hidden values in
strategic land assets such as its downtown Toronto property.
Like its parent, Marathon has a shareholder rights plan that
would distribute additional shares to shareholders if a
concern other than Canadian Pacific obtains 15% of the
outstanding shares.
   But few analysts agree on Marathon's asset values or
appropriate share price, given the uncertainty over the
future of its Southtown property and the hazards of a
softening Canadian real estate market.
   "I think takeover speculation is overdone in light of
current circumstances," said Frank Mayer, analyst at
Toronto's BBN James Capel Inc.
   Mr. Mayer said a renegotiation of zoning on the downtown
Toronto lands, which could take years and could get mired in
lawsuits, could depress Marathon's stock price by more than
C$1. He said the stock currently is trading on a takeover
premium, although there isn't any indication that an investor
or other Canadian real estate concern is accumulating shares.
   Mr. King agreed with analysts that institutional investors
or large Canadian real estate concerns could be interested in
acquiring Marathon shares up to the 15% threshold permitted
by its rights plan. He also acknowledged that there are some
selling pressures on the stock. U.S. shareholders of Canadian
Pacific may be pressed to sell their Marathon stock because
the distribution of Marathon shares to Canadian Pacific's
U.S. shareholders is taxable. In Canada, the distribution
isn't taxable. About 30% of Canadian Pacific shares are held
outside Canada. Also, certain Canadian Pacific shareholders
may not be interested in holding a pure real estate stock,
Mr. King said.
   As for Marathon's outlook for the current year, Mr. King
said he expects continued growth in the company's assets and
cash flow, but he cautioned that 1989 was an "exceptional
year." In 1989, Marathon had cash flow of C$135.8 million, or
C$1.37 a share on pro forma basis, compared with C$70.4
million or 71 Canadian cents a share in 1988. Land sales
contributed a substantial chunk of 1989 cash flow. Mr. King
said he expects that the second half of this year will be
better than the first half. Cash flow in the 1990 first
quarter was C$17.9 million or 18 cents a share.

   NEWPORT, Ark. -- These flatlands east of the Ozarks have
been very good to the Conner family. The family's farming
operation controls 35,000 acres of wheat fields and terraced
rice land here -- a stake that helps make the Conners the
leading property owners in Jackson County.
   In the 1980s, drought and plunging crop prices devastated
many farmers in this area. But not the Conners. They
prospered by raking in millions of federal crop subsidy
dollars, which allowed them to expand holdings that now
include a local mall, interests in John Deere and Chevrolet
dealerships and a real-estate firm.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trouble is, the Conners may have gotten much of this
money in violation of the law.
   Last year, a team of federal auditors concluded that John
Conner Jr., the 41-year-old family member who runs the farms
with his father, improperly collected $2.8 million in federal
payments -- the largest recorded abuse of America's farm
subsidy system.
   When Congress set limits on crop subsidy payments in 1970,
it intended to guarantee a fair return for farmers even if
the price of their crops fell through the floor. In part to
focus the program on small farmers, it restricted its
largess: Under current law, individual farmers aren't allowed
to collect any more than $250,000 in subsidy payments in any
one year.
   For a big operation like the Conners', $250,000 is
peanuts. So John Conner Jr. devised a plan: He divided his
farm holdings into many smaller pieces, each one of which
collected the maximum subsidy. This involved a labyrinth of
corporate entities and elaborate bookkeeping. Eventually
nearly everyone in the family got in on the act, plus a few
others.
   All told, 17 relatives, 10 employees, 13 corporations,
three partnerships and six trusts helped harvest the money.
The government would send checks to the relatives and
corporations, who would then turn over the funds -- in the
form of rent payments and fees -- to a company headed by John
Jr. and a partnership owned by the Conner family. A Conner
real-estate firm kept track of who owed what to whom. The
Conners say the government knew all along about their setup
and add that they even had approval from the Agriculture
Department.
   Though the Conner case is the largest ever uncovered, it
is far from unique. Even though total farm acreage has
remained constant in recent years, new "farmers" have been
sprouting up everywhere. The government believes this is
partly because of efforts to evade payment limits.
   Concerned that hundreds of millions of dollars are being
squandered, several congressmen have called for tightening
the government spigot. Even some prominent farm-state
legislators, such as Dan Glickman, the Democrat from Kansas,
say they are considering promoting new restrictions.
   They are also concerned about evidence that local offices
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture have looked the other
way -- or even helped set up arrangements similar to the
Conners'. John Conner Jr. says government officials here were
aware of everything he did. "I didn't turn around without
letting Floyd Campbell know about it," he says. Mr. Campbell
runs Jackson County's office of the agriculture department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, which
pays the subsidies.
   Indeed, the Agriculture Department -- bucking its auditors
-- has asked the Conners to pay back only $2.3 million of the
$2.8 million overpayment, saying the family didn't
intentionally violate the law. Notably, the agency's records
show that it routinely approved many of the steps the Conners
took. The auditors, who work for the department's inspector
general, also found Mr. Campbell himself violated certain
landlord-tenant rules and improperly collected thousands of
dollars in federal payments on farm property he rented from a
large insurance company, for which Mr. Conner acted as rental
agent. The Agriculture Department, however, disagreed with
the auditors and sided with Mr. Campbell on the matter.
   For his part, Mr. Campbell asserts that he didn't violate
federal rules. And as for the bigger Conner case, he says his
office failed to detect any improper payments because his
staff is overworked.
   Jackson County isn't the only area that has come under
scrutiny. In another case, the inspector general's office
criticized a "lack of commitment" by the Agriculture
Department in Jefferson County, Ark., where two senior
officials of the agency's office were found to have
improperly collected overpayments totaling $407,000 in 1987
on land they owned. (It isn't uncommon for Agriculture
Department field officers to be local farmers themselves.)
   Moreover, in 1987, the Agriculture Department's inspector
general found it had given a total of more than 130 farmers
in Arkansas improper subsidies totaling millions of dollars.
But it figured the farmers had relied on the agency's own bad
advice, so it didn't force any repayment.
   "The Agriculture Department has been a reluctant
dragon-slayer," says New York Democratic Congressman Charles
Schumer, who is urging tougher subsidy rules. "Payment limits
and their prosecution haven't been a high priority."
   But William Penn, an assistant deputy administrator at the
Agriculture Department, believes the agency has become more
aggressive, and notes that it has restaffed its Arkansas
state office. He also says new federal regulations that
became effective in 1989 have helped enforcement.
   "We're continuing to try to plug the holes," he says. "But
payment limits are a tough program to administer because
every time you come up with a rule, someone will find a way
to circumvent its intent."
   In theory, the crop support program is a simple one: It
sets a target price that it feels farmers should be making.
When market prices fall below that level, the U.S. gives a
check for the difference.
   But loopholes often render the limits ineffective. While
regulations say a subsidy recipient must be "actively
engaged" in either farm labor or management, investigators
find it hard to prove that sort of connection. "They can live
a thousand miles away and say they make all the decisions. I
don't know how we would disprove it," says John O. Leavy, the
Agriculture Department's regional inspector general for audit
in Temple, Texas.
   As a result, enterprising farmers have often found ways
around the law -- and regardless of how the Conner case is
resolved, John Jr. was clearly enterprising. A 1970 business
graduate of the University of Arkansas, he began taking over
the reins of his family's business after a stint in the
National Guard. He often worked 14-hour days running the
farms, barking out instructions to employees.
   "John Jr.'s a workaholic," his mother says of him. "I wish
he had a few hobbies."
   The family's blossoming farming operation -- and the
dispute over the support payments -- have made John Jr. a
major figure in Newport, population 8,300. Not since Elvis
Presley played at Porky's Rooftop, a Newport tavern, back in
the early 1950s has there been such a stir. A local liquor
store still honors the star's visit by selling ceramic
whiskey decanters that look like Elvis and play "Love Me
Tender."
   The Conner legacy dates back to John Jr.'s grandfather,
R.G. Holden, who cleared much of the land around Newport by
tearing out tree stumps with farmhands and scores of mules. A
Holden Ave. still runs through town, in honor of the Holden
family.
   When R.G. Holden died, he left much of his estate to his
daughter, Mary Alice, and her husband, John Conner Sr. She is
a stylish woman whom neighbors describe as the matriarch of
Newport society. He is a lifelong farmer and trained
accountant who sets his hat at a jaunty angle as he drives
his pickup along country roads inspecting the family land.
Their spacious brick house fronts on a bass-filled,
cypress-lined creek and the Newport country club's golf
course. A friend calls the family "rock-solid" Baptists.
   Both John Sr. and his son believe their relative
prosperity is what caused the government to scrutinize them.
"Why else would somebody shoot your tires out like this?"
asks the elder Mr. Conner.
   The Conners say their life style and business were
threatened in the 1980s by the same problems that were making
life miserable for other local farmers. Along with many
others, they decided to seek federal subsidies to stay
afloat. As prices for their crops fell, subsidy payments to
many farmers swelled to near federal limits. The Conners, who
were heavily invested in land and farm equipment, contend
that, by 1986, subsidies they were getting weren't enough for
them to break even.
   At the time, many larger farmers responded to the problem
by leasing out their property. Federal law does allow tenants
to collect subsidies and pay rent to landowners, thus
assuring an income for the landlord.
   But John Jr. went a step further, the government auditors
assert. He created four new corporations -- in addition to
nine already existing -- and enlisted the aid of relatives,
including sister Mary Alice Humphrey in Dallas and cousin Ann
Dillard in Little Rock, who both collected money through
partnerships. He also used trusts set up for his children,
including his twin girls, who were eight years old at the
time.
   Katherine Conner, John Jr.'s 66-year-old aunt, says she
didn't even know she was listed as receiving federal checks.
"Listen, I don't know the first thing about this," she says.
"John and them set this up. I'm not a farmer." Lelia Holden,
88, the frail and white-haired widow of R.G. Holden who
collected $126,909 in federal subsidies over two years, says
the same thing.
   "I don't know anything" about the farming operations, says
Mrs. Holden, wearing a pink housecoat and watching "Jeopardy"
in her home. "All the checks must go into the office because
I don't see them. John Sr. and Jr. handle all my business."
   Such arrangements wouldn't necessarily have violated
federal regulations, since people out of town or those not
working the land could legally have collected farm money as
landowners. But the staff of the inspector general's office
found the Conner family's business activities were
"controlled" by John Jr. and weren't "separate and distinct"
enough to qualify for federal support. John Jr.'s office kept
the books for partnerships and corporations through which his
sister, aunt, grandmother and cousin were sent money. Checks
for three of the four went to his office.
   Conner family employees and others also paid rent to
family entities. But the farm lease arrangements, auditors
found, included such curious features as "arbitrary" changes
of rental amounts and rent payments to entities with no
interest in the farming operation. Twenty-five of the
Conners' subsidy recipients paid most of their federal
earnings to companies controlled by John Jr. for "custom
farming," which means that someone other than the subsidy
recipients did the actual farm work. The auditors concluded
that the arrangements were chiefly designed to pass money
along to the Conner family.
   The Conners say the fees were legal and customary. But
investigators found they were excessive and ran afoul of
another government payment rule: At the time, anyone who
owned or leased farmland wasn't allowed to also get custom
farming fees on the same property.
   Some bank accounts of Conner employees, too, appeared to
be conduits for federal money to automatically pass through
to the Conner family. Max Felts, a burly farmhand from east
Arkansas's Mississippi County who worked for the Conners,
started receiving federal checks in 1986. Mr. Felts and John
Jr. describe this arrangement as simply a means for Mr. Felts
to start farming on his own.
   But bank records attached to the government's audit report
show he made repeated payments to Holden-Conner Farms Inc.
and a Conner family partnership for rent and "custom farming"
immediately after getting federal checks or bank loans. This
happened even when Holden-Conner's own records didn't show
him owing any money.
   The entire arrangement went undetected until a
Newport-area farmer complained to the inspector general's
office in Texas, which then took 15 months to complete its
report. The Agriculture Department eventually did send the
Conner subsidy recipients a bill for $2.3 million. The
Conners, in turn, have appealed the assessment to the
agency's headquarters in Washington. The government has
withheld subsequent payments to the Conner group.
   Meanwhile, the auditors have been complaining internally
that the inspector general's criminal investigation division
hasn't taken up the case, though 10 months have passed since
the audit was completed. Officials in the criminal
investigation office declined to comment.

   Technology Stocks Lead Market Rally,
   But There Are Signs of Possible Fading

   The over-the-counter market again rode the coattails of
technology stocks, but there were signs by the end of the
session that the rally might be fading.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index closed up 2.62 at 431.23, a
0.6% gain, with advancing shares leading declining stocks,
984 to 825. The Nasdaq 100 index of larger issues, including
some leading technology shares, surged 1.09% to 430.06, its
highest level since mid-April. Volume slipped to 122.6
million shares from 136.8 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Institutional interest continued to outpace buying among
small investors, said Ralph Costanza, manager of the OTC
department at Smith Barney, Harris &amp; Upham. Mr. Costanza
suggested investors had expected disappointments, but not
positive news, among OTC and technology stocks and are now
catching up with the rally.
   By midday, interest appeared to peak as such stocks as
Microsoft backed off their highs for the day, said Nicholas
Karos, senior OTC trader at Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood,
Minneapolis. After hitting 66 in intraday trading, Microsoft
finished 2 1/4 higher at 64, a 52-week closing high. Mr.
Karos suggested profit-taking might continue today.
   Technology companies continued to dominate the news, amid
both actual and anticipated announcements of improved
computer products.
   Intel led the day's most-active list after NCR Corp.
unveiled a family of high-end personal computers based on
Intel's 486 chip. Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlak said in
an interview that the Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor
maker's shares also remain in favor after company officials
told analysts last week that April orders are strong. Intel
rose 7/8 to 43 1/8 on 2.3 million shares.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton software analyst David Readerman
attributed the continuing rally in the technology sector to
new software products expected from such companies as
Microsoft, and new hardware products expected in the second
half of the year. In an interview, Mr. Readerman also noted
that first-quarter earnings for technology companies outpaced
other industry groups, largely because of strong
international demand.
   However, Mr. Readerman said that while the long-term
outlook for technology companies is looking better, he thinks
that some stocks, including as Microsoft, are fully valued in
the short term.
   Reports that Microsoft will unveil its long-awaited
Windows 3.0 software later this month helped drive the
Redmond, Wash., computer company's shares higher. Mr.
Readerman called the stock fairly priced, noting that it's
trading at 22 times his estimated fiscal 1991 earnings for
Microsoft of $2.90 a share. In the long-term, however, he
says the stock is attractive.
   Lotus gained 1/8 to 33 1/2 after the Cambridge, Mass.,
software maker said it will ship a new version of its 1-2-3
software program with improved graphics capability during the
third quarter. Noting that the stock traded as high as 33
1/2, Mr. Readerman attributed some of the strength to an
additional announcement by Lotus that at some point it will
ship a version that will be compatible with Microsoft's
upgraded Windows 3.0 program.
   MCI Communications gained 3/8 to 38 1/4 after the long
distance carrier declared a new semi-annual dividend of five
cents a share. The company said it expects to maintain that
level for two to three years.
   Centocor jumped 2 to 35 1/4. The Malvern, Pa.,
biotechnology company Saturday reported the results of
clinical trials of Centoxin, a drug used to treat septic
shock, before a medical meeting in Washington. Some analysts
told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report the results were
bullish for the stock, with Robertson Stephens analyst Mark
Simon saying he is maintaining a "buy" rating on Centocor.
Shares of Xoma, a Berkeley, Calif., company developing a
competing drug, rose 1/4 to 19 1/4.
   Nordstrom rose 1 3/8 to 29 1/8 after a CBS "60 Minutes"
segment on the Seattle, Wash., clothing retailer wasn't as
negative as some investors had expected, traders said.
   Washington Bancorp tumbled 5 1/2 to 3 1/2. The holding
company of National Bank of Washington, D.C., said it isn't
able to repay about $36.7 million of unsecured commercial
paper obligations because some unidentified but unrelated
banks cut off some lines of credit. The company said it will
discontinue its commercial paper program.
   Mediagenic fell 1 3/8 to 3 after the Menlo Park, Calif.,
company said it will report a $19 million loss on revenue of
$65 million for the fiscal year ended March 31. The publisher
of entertainment software said it hired an investment banker
and may put itself up for sale.
   Newbridge Networks lost 1 3/8 to close at 8 1/4 after the
Kanata, Ontario, maker of digital networking products said it
will not meet revenue and earnings expectations for the
fourth quarter ended April 30.
   Shares of B&amp;H Bulk Carriers dropped 5/8 to 4 3/8 after the
New York company reported a loss for the first quarter ended
March 31 of 16 cents a share, compared with net income of 67
cents a share a year earlier.

   WASHINGTON -- The White House said President Bush will
veto a bill that would force employers to give workers time
off to care for babies or for other family health reasons.
   Chief of Staff John Sununu told business lobbyists about
the administration position at a closed meeting. The White
House later confirmed his comments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The "family leave" legislation is expected to come up for
a vote on the House floor this week. It would require
employers of 50 or more employees to give their workers
unpaid time off to care for newborn or adopted babies; for
seriously ill children, spouses or parents; or for personal
health problems.
   The bill, which the Senate Labor Committee also has
approved, is vigorously opposed by business groups. They say
it would be too costly, and they object to legislation that
mandates employers to provide time off.
   The White House has said Mr. Bush would veto a bill
mandating such benefits, but it hadn't pledged specifically
to veto the current bill. The administration maintains that
the government shouldn't dictate the specific benefits
employees receive, arguing that "employers have a better
sense" of what should be offered, said Deputy White House
press secretary Alixe Glen.

   With Sales Falling, Chrysler Takes on Honda in New Ads

<LP>
   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. is launching a new
ad campaign aimed at reversing a sales plunge that has
mystified and mortified top executives.
   The ads, which begin today, claim Chrysler models are
superior to Honda Motor Co.'s much-touted Civic and Accord.
The campaign is based on recent tests with 200 car owners in
California, a market dominated by Honda and other imports.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The targets for the new campaign are customers Chrysler
needs to survive long-term: younger, more affluent buyers who
currently own domestic vehicles but are considering switching
to an import.
   The head-to-head comparisons ("Meet the Americans that
beat the Hondas") are an aggressive, high-stakes gamble for
Chrysler, but it has few other options. The company, which
once seemed able to fend off every sales slump with a new
advertising program or incentive gimmick, has watched its
U.S. car market share dive almost three percentage points in
only four months. This has happened despite some of the
heftiest rebates in Chrysler's history.
   If current trends continue, Chrysler will wind up 1990 in
fifth place in U.S. car sales, behind Honda and Toyota Motor
Corp. as well as General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
Chrysler still leads its Japanese rivals in combined car and
truck sales, thanks to its Jeeps and minivans. But the
company's share of total vehicle sales barely equals its
share of car sales alone in recent years.
   One possible reason for the drop is that Chrysler, over
the past two years, has killed off some 20 nameplates,
including what once were its best-selling cars: the boxy
Omni-Horizon subcompacts and Aries-Reliant compacts. These
and other discontinued cars -- larger, rear-wheel-drive
models including the Dodge Diplomat -- appealed to Chrysler's
historical owner base of older, blue-collar consumers.
   Chrysler may have moved too fast with the cuts, alienating
its traditional buyers, acknowledges Bennett E. Bidwell,
chairman of the auto maker's Chrysler Motors unit. But, he
says: "How do you go from yesterday's lineup . . . to
tomorrow's lineup, and a change in your owner base and your
owner demographics, without some surgery? And surgery always
carries a little pain with it."
   Other factors could be contributing to the dismal sales.
One is possible consumer backlash over Chrysler Chairman Lee
A. Iacocca's controversial "board room" television
commercial, which ran for three weeks in March. In it, an
agitated Mr. Iacocca told a group of Chrysler executives that
consumers don't realize Chrysler and other American auto
makers are building better cars than the Japanese. "And
that's gonna change," he growled at the end.
   Some critics have complained that the ads are just the
latest in what they see as a long history of "Japan-bashing"
by Mr. Iacocca. Others say Chrysler appeared to be blaming
consumers for the auto maker's slow sales.
   But Chrysler has tested consumer reaction to the
commercial. Company officials say that market research, as
well as letters and calls to the company, show no evidence
that consumers have had too much of the outspoken Mr.
Iacocca. In fact, response to the board room ad has been
overwhelmingly positive, said John B. Damoose, vice president
of brand marketing at a news conference yesterday.
   So the new ads again feature Mr. Iacocca, who gives the
results of tests Chrysler commissioned from U.S. Testing Co.
Market Research Inc. of Wheeling, Ill. Two hundred owners of
GM and Ford cars who said "they either definitely or probably
would consider buying a Japanese import" were asked to
compare Chrysler products with those of Honda.
   Eighty-three out of 100 in one group judged Dodge Spirit
and Plymouth Acclaim "superior overall" to the Honda Accord
in styling, comfort, convenience, driving experience and
riding comfort. Seventy-six out of 100 in the second group
ranked Plymouth Sundance and Dodge Shadow ahead of Honda
Civic on the same criteria.
   Chrysler officials acknowledged that the new ads may test
its credibility with some consumers, particularly the
comparisons with the Accord, which was the best-selling car
in the U.S. last year. "I got to tell you, we had no idea we
would win such a test so decisively," said Mr. Damoose. "It
was a shock to all of us."
   Honda declined to comment on the attack. It would be
"inappropriate," said Honda spokesman Kurt Antonius. "We
don't want to say anything until we see the commercial."
   At yesterday's news conference, reporters asked why
Chrysler didn't run the tests with current import owners. Mr.
Damoose replied that Chrysler mainly is aiming to attract
some of the more than 60% of American buyers who still own
domestic cars but who are inclined to buy Japanese the next
time around. He also noted that the tests were run in Los
Angeles, an area with extremely high import sales.
   Chrysler needs a boost from this campaign to offset the
anemic sales of some other vehicles. The auto maker added
several luxury models over the past year, for example, but
its luxury car sales overall are off some 30% from 1989
levels.
   And the Dodge Monaco, a derivation of the slow-selling
Eagle Premier, has proved to be a disaster. Chrysler has sold
only 928 of the cars during the first four months of this
year; at the end of March, dealers had enough Monacos to last
more than 400 days. Premier sales, never robust to begin
with, have bogged down even more this year, with deliveries
through April 30 down more than 60% compared with 1989.
   Chrysler officials point to other factors that have cut
into the auto maker's sales. Chrysler is buying some 50,000
fewer vehicles this year from Mitsubishi Motors Corp., its
Japanese partner, to concentrate on sales of vehicles it
builds itself. Chrysler also has chosen to to drop some fleet
business it believes isn't profitable, cutting sales by an
additional 50,000 to 70,000 vehicles.
   Mr. Bidwell believes Chrysler still can win a 13% share of
all U.S. car and truck sales this year, down from 13.5% in
1989. For the first four months of the year, Chrysler's share
was 12.4%, buoyed by the first-ever rebates on its minivans,
which produced record January sales.
   As Chrysler executives search for solutions to the sales
plunge, the one thing saving the company right now from real
disaster is its six-month-old, $1.5 billion cost-cutting
program. Chrysler executives, criticized for not watching
expenses over the past few years, surprised Wall Street by
running auto operations in the black in the first quarter.
The profit was just $5 million, but that success helped
Chrysler's stock rebound from the six-year low of $14.50 a
share it reached April 30. (In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Chrysler shares closed at
$16.50, up 12.5 cents.)
   But cost-cutting alone won't be enough to get the company
through what promises to be a rough few months -- and
possibly years. Chrysler will lose income later this year
when it closes its two minivan plants for a month to retool
for the 1991 versions. And the company doesn't have any new,
high-volume cars coming until 1992, when it is to introduce a
line of family cars code-named the L/H models.
   Mr. Damoose acknowledged that, even with the marketing
blitz Chrysler plans over the next few months, it will take
time to turn consumer perceptions around. "I think it's going
to be 90 days before you begin to see" any real impact on
sales, he said yesterday. Over the short-term, commercials
featuring such items as air bags, which Chrysler is heavily
promoting, won't "make people run into dealerships . . . but
long-term, they will."

   SANTA FE, N.M. -- Even in this city of artists, New Agers
and freethinkers, the Santa Fe Institute ranks as an oddity.
   The headquarters of this private think tank is a converted
convent built of adobe. Inside are Ph.D.s with ponytails who
wander the halls talking about Boolean algebra and artificial
life. Biologists rub shoulders with computer jocks.
Economists argue with physicists. No idea is too crazy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I can come here and be totally outrageous for a while,
say things that are off the wall, and still get a hearing,"
says W. Brian Arthur, a Stanford University economist.
   Yet the Santa Fe Institute isn't just another kooky little
outfit. To begin with, four Nobel laureates in physics and
economics are actively involved in what goes on here. Santa
Fe's chairman is Robert O. Anderson, the retired head of Arco
and of the Aspen Institute. The president of the organization
is a noted scientist, George Cowan, from Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
   Ideas bandied about here have aroused the interest of the
commercial world, from Wall Streeters, to California venture
capitalists, to Citicorp's chairman, John Reed. A visit he
made here in 1986 triggered a big effort to develop a
sophisticated model of the global economy.
   One idea that came out of that: "the law of increasing
returns." Once things get rolling, they keep rolling and feed
on themselves, up to a point. Hence, mudslides and
avalanches, real-estate booms and stock-market crashes. (Most
academics had been focusing mainly on a world in equilibrium
and on the law of diminishing returns.)
   Unlocking the secrets of complex phenomena is the stated
purpose of the handful of full-timers, as well as the
hundreds of transient thinkers who are here for a week or a
month or a year. Some of the work falls into the
scientifically fashionable category of "chaos theory," which
holds that certain events are neither strictly predictable
nor random.
   But the real world's interest in this place has little to
do with intellectual fashion and a lot to do with making
money.
   And so it came to pass that the Santa Fe crowd is trying
to figure out how the price of gold fluctuates and what
pushes IBM stock up and down. Researchers are putting
together computer models that they hope might explain, for
instance, what is not already known about why Taiwan is
booming and the Philippines is an economic mess. Economists
here think they already know that the "law of increasing
returns" explains why the Betamax videocassette format was
overwhelmed by VHS.
   Wall Street investment houses, such as Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co., have sent emissaries to sniff around. Their curiosity
was piqued by a "double auction" market developed here.
Computer-driven trading strategies pretend to buy and sell
securities, and the Santa Fe researchers record and analyze
the results. Among other things, they want to know if
computers can be programmed to "learn" from trading
experience.
   Santa Fe's computer work has drawn attention from
researchers in biology and medicine. George Sugihara of
Scripps Institution, in La Jolla, Calif., says that Santa
Fe's theories offer superior ways to predict measles
epidemics. And now he is using the models to explore the
baffling changes in body temperature found in malaria
patients.
   "This is important," Mr. Sugihara says, "because there's a
point when the temperature returns to near normal, and that's
when there's great danger of death. So if you could predict
that, you could make sure the patient is under intensive care
at that time."
   The Santa Fe Institute has a chronic problem of its own: a
lack of money. And that, in turn, isn't helped by the aura
the place has of detached otherworldliness.
   The institute has been short of cash ever since it was
founded in 1984 by a group of scientists -- mostly physicists
-- from nearby Los Alamos. When the organization began, its
goal was to become a facsimile of Rockefeller University -- a
large, prestigious center for advanced research.
   Today, its budget is still rather piddling, just $2
million a year. The biggest chunks of money come from the
National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and the
MacArthur Foundation. The rest comes from private outfits and
individuals. Robert Noyce, the founder of Intel Corp.,
recently anted up $50,000.
   At least one board member complains that the institute is
far too shy about hitting up rich people for money. Arthur
Spiegel, an Albuquerque fund raiser and the think tank's
first benefactor, claims to be very unhappy and to have
resigned from the board over its unaggressive approach to
raising money. He has since rejoined the board, however, and
has high praise for the institute's purposes.
   Mr. Anderson, the chairman, says money is a problem
because the institute appeals to a "narrow audience." But
because he has connections, he continues to bring in
well-heeled potential donors for casual visits. One morning
recently, Mr. Anderson appeared at the door in his cowboy hat
and bandanna, with David Rockefeller and his wife in tow. The
Rockefellers spent maybe 45 minutes talking, about population
growth, global warming and such with institute personnel.
   And that suggests the second problem: the abstract nature
of what people here are thinking. Mostly, people at the
institute are building computer models of complex phenomena.
The models are supposed to show how molecules, markets or
national economies evolve. "We give you movies, instead of
just a snapshot," says Mr. Cowan, the institute's president.
"We think it's the next big thing."
   Nobody questions the Santa Fe crowd's blue-ribbon
credentials, but some critics don't expect much in the way of
results from such a theoretical pursuit. They find it faintly
amusing that Citicorp's Mr. Reed would hire the institute to
mix math and physics in hopes of averting some future Latin
American debt fiasco.
   When Mr. Reed visited Santa Fe, he brought along three
senior assistants. The Santa Fe people assembled a handful of
physicists, computer scientists and economists. They took
space at a nearby resort for two days and tried to create an
informal, relaxed setting. But they recall Mr. Reed wasn't in
good humor.
   Economists hadn't predicted the Latin American debt
crisis, Mr. Reed complained. The debtors' inability to repay
had created a gigantic problem for lenders like Citicorp.
Econometric models hadn't anticipated the vicious combination
of lower rates of inflation and rising interest rates that
had devastated the economies of Mexico, Argentina and Brazil.
So Mr. Reed, who is a metallurgical engineering graduate of
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, put up some money and
asked the Santa Fe Institute to work on a new, improved model
of the world economy.
   Two Nobel laureates led the effort -- Philip Anderson, a
Princeton University physicist, and Kenneth Arrow, a Stanford
University economist. The manifest result of this work in
progress was a 10-day meeting on markets and the global
economy in September 1987 for which Citicorp put up about
$100,000.
   Markets aren't perfectly rational, the participants
concurred. Unsophisticated investors create "noise" and drive
prices up or down, beyond rational expectations. Things that
start rolling tend to snowball.
   David Pines, a physicist at the University of Illinois,
listened to all the talk, got to worrying about his
investments, and decided to bail out of the stock market. "I
called my financial adviser, but he persuaded me against
pulling out. So I didn't," Mr. Pines says. Five weeks later,
the market crashed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped
508 points in a single day.
   Today, more than two years later, the project on the world
economy is still going strong. And it is without conclusive
results. Citicorp officials say they are patient and that
they are continuing to pay for the work. "If these guys at
Santa Fe can't do it, nobody can," says Eugenia Singer, a
Citicorp vice president. "We knew they wouldn't solve the
problem {of modeling the global economy} in one or two years,
maybe not even in 10 years. The problems are humongous."
   Mr. Arthur, the Stanford economist who returned to the
university after a year in Santa Fe, thinks that more
economists might start to embrace ideas of the sort being
generated here. He sees a "sea change in economics," for
instance, with more mainstream economists paying attention to
snowballing and the law of increasing returns.
   The theory applies not only to markets but to business
strategy, Mr. Arthur says. For example, once a product or a
technology starts to pull ahead of the pack, its success
tends to bring more success, more market share, more sales
volume. The tendency is great for the "winner to take most,"
as Mr. Arthur puts it.
   Mr. Arthur says that economists have paid attention to
such ideas in the past, including particularly the late
Alfred Marshall. "But the prevalent view is still that things
happen in equilibrium, and that there are constant or
diminishing returns."
   In a world economy based on natural resources, maybe the
law of diminishing returns had its utility, Mr. Arthur says,
but no longer. "A high-tech, high value-added world calls for
a new kind of economics."
   Seizing market share is crucial, he says, pointing to a
strategy often used by Japanese companies. Often the most
successful Japanese companies win by letting others do
expensive research; then they make a big push as the market
is building and cut prices to increase sales volume. That
drives down costs, which builds more volume. Gradually, the
competitors are squeezed. Mr. Arthur points to the way
Matsushita Electric's VHS videocassette recorder trounced
Sony's Betamax.
   Windows of opportunity tend to close, so a tiny initial
advantage in business can be critical in determining the
outcome of a battle.
   Another, related idea, much in vogue at Santa Fe, is that
since small differences are important, precise measurements
are too, particularly when an enterprise is just getting
started. They help predict outcomes.
   J. Doyne Farmer tried to apply that idea to roulette. Back
in the late 1970s, Mr. Farmer was studying for a Ph.D. in
physics. In his spare time, he nursed a passion for roulette.
And he worked up complex equations on a computer that would
calculate the croupier's toss, the spin of the wheel, the
path of the ball, and a rough estimate of where it would
land.
   Then he strapped on a little homemade computer and went
off to Las Vegas. He made his calculations on the hoof,
placed his bets and eventually won nearly $7,000.
   Today, the tall, ponytailed Mr. Farmer divides his time
between the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Santa Fe
Institute. Among other things, he is searching for deep
patterns of predictive value in the price of IBM shares, and
in the gyrations of gold prices. Knowing "what predicts
what," to use his phrase, could have money-making
possibilities. So far, he has had little success, but he
communicates with so-called black box researchers at Wall
Street brokerage houses.
   Mr. Farmer says he is ambivalent about trying to apply his
theories solely to making money. "I'm confused on the issue,"
he says. "I'm a scientist, and I'm trying to have fun. For
me, that means doing something intellectually challenging and
fundamental that touches on philosophy and religion as well
as physics." On the other hand, he is tired of applying for
research grants. To be independently wealthy would make his
professional life easier. "I really do think some of the
ideas we have could be used to make money."
   So does James Pelkey, a California venture capitalist who
recently bought land in Santa Fe and is building a house. He
believes that some of the computer programs being developed
at the institute could be turned into commercial
computer-software for business. Sales forecasting is one of
the applications he thinks is possible.
   But anybody who thinks the city of Santa Fe is going to
become another Silicon Valley because of the institute
probably is misusing his powers of prediction. The city is
small, with just 55,000 people. It is isolated. Jets aren't
allowed to land at Santa Fe's little airport. Water is
scarce, and so are skilled purchasing agents, personnel
managers and technicians.
   It is more likely, Mr. Pelkey believes, that some
companies will incubate in Santa Fe, then move to
Albuquerque, 50 miles south.
   Morton Meyerson, the former president of EDS Systems and a
part-time resident of Santa Fe, also doubts that the city's
burgeoning development as a center of art, music and tourism
will be matched by a parallel, entrepreneurial boom.
   He thinks that that is 10 times more likely to happen to
Austin, Texas, five times as likely to happen to Phoenix. "On
the other hand," Mr. Meyerson says, given all the thinkers
gathered hereabouts, it is likely that "Santa Fe will become
a center for the exploration of the great unknown."

   Waxman Threatens Orphans

   Wouldn't you know it? For once Congress passes a bill that
actually accomplishes a lofty goal -- saving thousands of
lives -- and some Member has to go and decide the program
works too well. The Orphan Drug Act has encouraged the
development of dozens of life-saving drugs since 1983, but
Rep. Henry Waxman wants to risk the program apparently
because he has diagnosed a troublesome side effect --
profits.
   The California Democrat proposes changes that would repeal
the law's only reason for being, to encourage development of
drugs for rare diseases. The law works by doing what the
government does too rarely. It establishes a clear private
property right that benefits everyone.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The law gives pharmaceutical firms a seven-year exclusive
right to sell these highly specialized drugs. "If someone had
told me when the law passed that I would now be in Henry
Waxman's office because the orphan drugs had become too
profitable, I'd have thought they were crazy," says Abbey
Meyers, who runs a patients group called National
Organization for Rare Disorders. Her group is delighted with
the law as it is. It's been a boon to the more than 10
million Americans who suffer from among 5,000 rare diseases,
some with as few as a dozen victims.
   Rep. Waxman's new rules would cancel the seven-year
exclusivity in midstream because he says some new orphan
drugs have turned out to be "highly profitable." But trying
to develop a new drug is a lot like digging for oil -- you
dig a lot of dry holes before a shot at a geyser. Though most
of the more than 40 orphan drugs now on the market yield
modest sales, a drug for treating anemia in patients with
kidney failure is expected to have annual sales of $200
million, a hormone to treat dwarfism in children will bring
sales of some $150 million and a drug to prevent the
pneumonia associated with AIDS has more patients than anyone
expected.
   Under the Waxman amendments, a firm would lose its
protection if another firm could show that it developed the
drug "simultaneously." This is defined to mean six months
after the first firm designates an orphan drug. A firm would
also lose its exclusive right if it later turned out that
there were more than 200,000 patients who could use the drug.
   This would create great uncertainty about who owns the
rights to sell drugs. It would be impossible to predict the
minimum payout from R&amp;D for an orphan drug. We would be back
to the problem of how to encourage the development of orphan
drugs. Some 300 new orphan drugs already in the works would
be at risk. It's also worth noting that the orphan-drug law
gave small pharmaceutical companies a rare incentive to
compete with the big firms.
   Rep. Waxman would also open up the federal government to
huge lawsuits by companies that relied on the 1983 law. Their
expected returns from orphan drugs in development or
production would be stolen, an obvious violation of the
Constitution's Takings Clause. Genentech is already
threatening a lawsuit demanding compensation for
expropriation.
   Rep. Waxman, who supported the original orphan-drug bill,
has forgotten that drug profits are also good for patients;
each sale represents a treatment. Patients with these rare
diseases naturally prefer a drug with profit to its maker to
no drug at all. Rep. Waxman should pat himself on the back
for the successes of the orphan-drug bill and leave well
enough alone.

   Japan Has Yen to Take Home
   America's Cup, but Hopes
   Rest on a Green Crew

   GAMAGORI, Japan -- Oddly enough for an island nation,
Japan isn't exactly awash in old salts. Which poses a bit of
a problem in its quest for yachting's most prestigious prize,
the America's Cup.
   Japan had to resort to the want-ads to find enough sailors
for its team. A tendency toward seasickness was no cause for
disqualification. Neither was inexperience.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "At first, I was so scared when the boat heeled," says
Matsuyoshi Nishikawa, 25, a former white-collar worker who,
despite never having sailed before, made the cut. "We are so
behind," he says humbly, "but we want to try hard to win."
   Another American institution will be up for grabs in 1992,
and Japan is determined to bring this one home for the
mantle. "We can't bring back Rockefeller Center. We can't
bring back Columbia Pictures," says Kaoru Ogimi, vice
commodore of the Nippon Ocean Racing Club. "But we want to
bring back the America's Cup."
   No expense is being spared in the quest for the ornate
silver chalice nicknamed the "Auld Mug." Some 30 of Japan's
biggest corporations, including Mazda Motor Corp. and Yamaha
Motor Co., have agreed to bankroll the effort by the Nippon
Club, which is challenging the current cup holder, the San
Diego Yacht Club. American yacht racing enthusiasts believe
the Japanese may spend as much as $100 million -- four times
as much as the San Diegans are estimated to have spent to win
the last race in 1988.
   Nippon Challenge, the syndicate backing the club, won't
discuss its budget, but its deep pockets are the talk of the
yachting world. "The Japanese may well become the fear of the
America's Cup," says Andrew A. Johns, the New Zealand lawyer
who masterminded his countrymen's boat-design strategy for
the last race. (The New Zealanders, sailing a single-hulled
boat, were beaten by the Americans, who sailed a catamaran,
in that controversial race. The New Zealanders promptly
launched a court battle, which was ultimately resolved in the
Americans' favor two weeks ago.)
   Some of Nippon Challenge's money is going to pay the
salaries of Roy Dickson, a New Zealander who is considered
one of the world's leading sailing coaches, and his son
Chris, the world's top-ranked sailor on the match-racing
circuit. Chris will be at the helm during the race.
   Multi-national crews are permitted under the rules
governing the America's Cup, but there was some grumbling
among nationalists here about having foreigners involved in
the quest for the cup. Yachties here concede they need help
whipping a green crew into shape, so the complaints were
brushed aside.
   Coach Dickson runs a tight ship. Training begins every day
at 6:30 a.m. with a grueling workout before breakfast. The
crew's day doesn't end until after a 7:30 p.m. "reflection
meeting" to discuss the group's performance that day. The day
is tightly scheduled from reveille to taps, and it includes
language lessons, since most sailing terms are in English.
Tardiness isn't tolerated. Sailors even a few minutes late
are ordered to hit the deck and do push-ups.
   "I didn't even know what the America's Cup was," says one
of the sailors, Taketaro Suizu. The 26-year-old former office
worker wasn't exactly a landlubber; he had gotten his sea
legs wind-surfing on weekends. After seeing the syndicate's
ad, he decided to give yachting a try. Mr. Suizu is the
pitman, and his job is to bag sails in the bowels of the
boat. That translates roughly to hauling about a half-ton of
wet wash a day. Despite the unglamorous work, Mr. Suizu says
he is enjoying his new career.
   Base camp is this sleepy resort village on the edge of
Mikawa Bay, three hours by bullet train southwest of Tokyo.
The site was chosen because the wind and water conditions are
similar to those off sunny San Diego, where the next race
will be held.
   A few weeks ago, Nippon Challenge unveiled its first
racing yacht, a sleek 24-meter boat with a stunning 35-meter
carbon-fiber mast. The boat is brimming with high-tech
gadgetry. Cameras atop the mast measure sail configurations;
the data are fed into computers for analysis.
   A Shinto purification ceremony preceded the launching of
the Nippon. Near the dock was a small altar with offerings of
bananas, carrots and large white radishes. A Shinto priest in
a bright orange robe prayed and shook a sacred staff with
white streamers toward the boat to ward off evil spirits.
Then the dignitaries, among them Princess Tomohito of Mikasa,
a member of the Imperial Family, sipped sake and toasted the
effort.
   After the ceremony, the team took to the sea to
demonstrate the capabilities of the boat, the first of
several the syndicate expects to build. The cloudy skies and
choppy waters didn't deter curious local sailors, who came
out to see the Nippon. The racing boat's crisp white sails
caught the breeze, and it shot through the water, leaving
behind the scores of small boats bobbing in the bay.
   The Japanese are among 14 challengers from 11 nations
seeking the oldest trophy in sport. There is no prize money
for the winning team. At stake is prestige -- and the
attention of the world's sports buffs.
   To raise money for the effort, Nippon Challenge appealed
to national pride. "There won't be any profit in it for you,"
Taro Kimura, a well-known television newscaster and a member
of the syndicate's executive committee, recalls telling
corporate executives and others. "You have to do this for
Japan." Dozens heeded the call.
   CSK Corp., a leading computer software firm, donated
supercomputer time. Shipbuilder Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries Co. gave the syndicate's yacht designers unlimited
access to a testing tank, in which they analyzed a model
boat's performance. Tokyo University provided use of a highly
sophisticated wind tunnel to test sail configurations.
   All this is being done in an effort to win a race once
derided by the legendary New York Times sports columnist Red
Smith as "the trivial adventures of millionaires getting
their bottoms wet." The America's Cup began in 1851, when a
U.S. schooner beat a British fleet in a race around the Isle
of Wight. The Americans forced subsequent challengers to come
to their shores and race -- a strategy that favored the home
team for 132 years -- until 1983.
   That year, in a stunning reversal, the Australians
snatched the trophy from the Americans. That defeat was an
inspiration to Tatsumitsu Yamazaki, a yachtsman and the
chairman of S&amp;B Shokuhin Co., which is a household name in
spices and sauces in Japan. He decided it was a propitious
time for the Nippon Ocean Racing Club.
   Mr. Yamazaki rounded up a clique of fellow yachties -- all
of them business and media barons -- and announced the
group's intention to seek the cup. He says he is delighted
with the syndicate's progress so far. "The cup," he says, "is
within our reach."
   Still, the Japanese have a way to go. Makoto Namba, the
team's captain, recently admitted that the crew's performance
on the Nippon was only about 60%. But there is no doubt the
team is already well-steeped in the spirit of the America's
Cup. Stretching across the wall in the sail loft at the base
camp is a banner that reads "There is no second."

   CHICAGO -- Vernon R. Loucks, Baxter International Inc.'s
chairman and chief executive officer, reiterated that the
company sold its Israeli plant for business reasons, and not
to win removal from the Arab League blacklist of companies
doing business in Israel.
   Mr. Loucks told shareholders at the company's annual
meeting that while the issue "is a source of some
embarrassment . . . because it has been brought up {in a way
that} presumes guilt" on Baxter's part, the company had since
1974 been studying problems with its Israeli business that
were unrelated to its Arab League blacklisting.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As reported in a page one story in The Wall Street Journal
earlier this month, Baxter was removed from the Arab
blacklist last year after more than a decade of being shut
out of most Middle Eastern markets. Its de-blacklisting
followed by about a year the sale of the Ashdod, Israel,
plant that prompted Baxter's blacklisting in the first place.
   A U.S. anti-boycott law forbids the sale of Israeli
facilities to win removal from the Arab League blacklist.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commerce
Department are reviewing the matter, and the audit committee
of the Baxter board has commissioned an outside lawyer to
conduct an independent investigation.

   LOS ANGELES -- H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., parent company of Home
Savings of America, said it has reduced its recourse
liability on $6.2 billion of mortgage loans it previously
sold to the Federal National Mortgage Association.
   The recourse provision required Ahmanson to compensate the
mortgage agency if certain losses occurred from foreclosures.
The affected mortgages had to be backed by more capital under
a risk-based weighting used by regulators. Ahmanson removed
the recourse provision by buying financial guarantees to
replace its obligation to Fannie Mae. The move comes as part
of the thrift holding company's program to increase its
capital ratios as required by federal regulations governing
the operations of the nation's thrifts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Home Savings of America exceeds by an ample margin all
current capital requirements imposed by the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989
(FIRREA)," said Richard A. Diehl, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   He added that along with the company's acquisition of Home
Savings Bank of New York, the action will help the company
meet the new regulation's fully phased-in capital requirement
as soon as possible.
   Effective with the reduction of recourse liability, Home
Savings' risk-based capital ratio will increase to 7.57% from
7.11%, effective with the move. Its tangible capital ratio
remains unchanged at 3.51%, and its core capital ratio
remains at 4.37%.

   DALLAS -- Occidental Chemical Co. said a proposed $200
million project in the Soviet Ukraine was stalled after local
residents complained about toxic pollutants from an existing
petrochemical complex there.
   "We agreed to a one-year delay at the request of our
joint-venture partner, which owns the complex," said an
Occidental Chemical spokesman. The partner is Chlorvinyl, a
state-owned company under the direction of the Soviet
Chemical Industry Ministry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On April 10, opponents of Occidental's project sponsored a
"town meeting" in Kalush near the complex, said a spokeswoman
for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S.
environmental advocacy group. Residents want the existing
plant to "be brought up to standard" before any expansion
takes place, she said.
   Toxic emissions from the Chlorvinyl complex exceed maximum
permissible concentrations set by the Soviet government,
according to the National Resources Defense Council. Since
November, Soviet law has required an environmental assessment
for new industrial projects prior to their approval.
   Occidental, a unit of Los Angeles-based Occidental
Petroleum Corp., signed an agreement with Chlorvinyl two
years ago to construct and operate two plants at the complex
that would make polyvinyl chloride, a widely used plastic.
Occidental said it would have a 25% stake in the project. The
existing plant makes vinylchloride, among other chemicals.

   Soviet Union Keeps Buying Corn at 1989 Pace
   But U.S. Traders Worry About Its Financing

   The Soviet Union is buying U.S. corn at a near-record
pace, but there are nagging concerns about its ability to pay
bills.
   The Agriculture Department confirmed that the Soviets had
purchased 1,750,000 metric tons of corn. But grain experts
speculate that the Soviets needed Japanese credit to pull off
the deals, another sign of Moscow's eroding reputation as a
reliable and savvy trader.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last fall, the Soviet Union took the unusual step of
asking for short-term credit to buy U.S. crops; it
traditionally had paid cash. Then this spring, it began
having problems providing collateral to back the credit, and
some U.S. grain merchants temporarily stopped taking new
business. New York-based Continental Grain Co., for example,
stayed on the sidelines during the bidding on one shipment of
wheat to the Soviets.
   Around three weeks ago came the first reports that the
Soviets had to turn to Japanese trading firms for credit to
finance U.S. purchases. More recently, there have been
widespread reports that the Soviets are falling behind on
payments to Western companies for everything from steel to
wool.
   According to U.S. grain industry officials, Soviet buying
is being hampered by internal confusion over the
restructuring of the Soviet bureaucracy and economy. Moscow
also has been pinched by flat prices for oil and gold, two
commodities it sells as a source of currency for importing
goods.
   The Soviet cash crunch might get worse in the wake of
Moscow's announcement that it is boosting the price it pays
to Soviet grain farmers an average of 50%.
   The move is intended to boost domestic production, which
would reduce its dependency on foreign grain, but in the near
term the Soviet budget deficit would balloon.
   Last fall, tremors rippled through the world grain markets
when Moscow unveiled an unusual program to reward Soviet
wheat farmers who exceed production goals. Traders were
worried that the Soviets might have to trim spending on
imports in order to finance the domestic wheat-growing
incentives. Because of inefficient growing practices and
staggering losses due to spoilage, the Soviet Union is one of
the largest importers of food.
   The Soviet Union still carries considerable clout. It is
one of the biggest buyers of U.S. crops, and most grain
industry officials and traders insist on anonymity when
discussing the Soviet Union's murky financial woes.
   Indeed, the Soviet problems so far haven't had a
noticeable effect on grain prices in the U.S. The Japanese
credit is probably enough to allow the Soviets to finish
their grain purchases before the summer, which is when Soviet
grain imports dwindle as its own crops matures, said Bill
Biedermann, director of research at Allendale Inc. in
suburban Chicago.
   At the Chicago Board of Trade, prices of corn futures
contracts for May delivery rose 3.5 cents a bushel to settle
at $2.9075 a bushel. Prices of soybean and wheat futures
contracts also rose sharply amid heavy buying by commodity
funds and futures brokerage firms.
   Despite its payment problems, the Soviet Union is managing
to keep pace with last year's hefty level of corn purchases.
Since October, Moscow has agreed to buy roughly 15.6 million
metric tons of U.S. corn. The Soviet record is roughly 16
million metric tons, purchased in the year ended Sept. 30,
1989.
   The Soviet credit problems, however, are strengthening
calls for the U.S. to grant it most-favored-nation trading
status, which would make it eligible for preferential
treatment and credits from Washington.
   The severity of the Soviet credit problems isn't clear,
but they are affecting many of its imports. The Soviet Union
is reportedly asking the major wool-producing nations of
Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Uruguay to extend
credit on purchases.
   The New Zealand Council of Wool Exporters said its members
halted shipments to the Soviets because of unpaid bills
totaling $30 million. The Australian Wool Exporters Council
said the Soviets owe its members more than 100 million
Australian dollars (US$75.6 million) for wool that has been
shipped and another A$50 million for wool that has been
ordered.
   The group said it received a telex from Novoexport, the
Soviet Union's import agency, requesting an extension of
credit.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices were mixed in light activity, in
part because London markets were closed for a bank holiday.
The soonest-to-expire July and October contracts, which have
no trading limits and fell more than one cent a pound Friday,
recovered slightly. The July contract rose 0.16 cent a pound
to 14.60 cents and October advanced 0.06 cent to 14.56 cents.
More deferred contracts, however, whose declines were
restricted Friday by trading limits of 0.50 cent a pound,
continued to fall and were off 0.28 cent to 0.30 cent.
Friday's shakeout reflects growing pessimism that world
demand won't be sufficient to cause shortages of sugar,
according to Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton,
New York. "Such concerns come after a long absence of buying
from China and India, both of which had been expected to have
substantial import needs earlier in the year," Ms. Kaul said.
She noted that news reports cited ample supplies of sugar in
China and expectations of record production in India. These
reports further fueled pessimism about prices, she said.
However, Chinese officials still cited the need to import
about two million tons of sugar, but no purchases have been
made, Ms. Kaul said. In India, officials have yet to rule out
the possibility of imports, as even with record output only a
small surplus will remain at the end of this season, she
noted. Ms. Kaul said that in her view, "the timing of such
reports in the wake of Friday's sharp break indicates these
potential purchasers may be trying to push prices down to
even lower levels before making purchases." Separately, the
Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange said that Friday's trading
volume in the world sugar contract amounted to a record
81,320 contracts, topping the previous record of 59,989
contracts, set on July 6, 1989. Shearson's Ms. Kaul observed
that the total open interest, or the number of contracts
outstanding that remain to be liquidated by either an
opposite trade or delivery of the commodity, fell only 7,431
contracts to 178,026 contracts. She said this indicated that,
while some fresh buying may have been attracted by the
decline, many traders liquidated long positions and went
short, or sold contracts in anticipation that prices will go
even lower. This situation could set the stage for a
potential rebound if these short sellers have to cover, or
buy back, their positions, Ms. Kaul said.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil prices rose, largely on news that a
major pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico was closed down as a
result of a leak. West Texas Intermediate for June delivery
rose 29 cents a barrel to close at $18.27 in trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Already, production of 95,000
barrels a day has been halted from platforms owned by several
major U.S. energy companies, according to a spokesman for
Texaco Inc., which operates the pipeline. It's unclear how
much of an impact the spill from the pipeline, which has a
capacity of 125,000 barrels a day, will ultimately have on
pricing. Texaco says that it doesn't yet know how long the
pipeline will be shut down. Divers were on their way to the
scene to try and determine where the break might have
occurred. Texaco said that about 900 barrels of crude oil
have spilled into the Gulf's waters. Early indications
suggest that the 20-inch pipeline is the source. The pipe
serves 36 production platforms in the area. Texaco has
accepted responsibility for the cleanup and as of late
yesterday there was one skimmer ship on the scene. Others
were expected to arrive within hours. The spill covers an
area at least five miles wide by 20 miles long.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices eased in quiet trading. The July
contract fell 1.60 cents a pound to $1.0965. The softer tone
to the market reflected the return to work of Southern Peru
Copper Corp. employees in Peru, said Fred Demler, metals
economist for PaineWebber Inc. in New York. The miners and
smelter employees resumed work Friday in compliance with a
government order that threatened them with the loss of their
jobs if they didn't return, Mr. Demler noted. However,
management and unions will resume their negotiations
tomorrow, he said. A three-day sympathy strike by Peruvian
miners was scheduled to start yesterday, but as the Southern
Peru employees have returned, the strike was canceled,
according to Mr. Demler. Bullish factors in the market, he
noted, are that inventories of copper still remain low,
world-wide demand for the metal continues strong, and labor
contracts with U.S. and Canadian copper companies are
scheduled to expire at the end of June. The approach of
negotiations and the possibility of strikes are likely to
create concern about production disruptions, Mr. Demler said.

   NEW YORK -- The dollar slipped further against the mark
yesterday, still hurt by Friday's U.S. employment data. The
mark also benefited from a more positive market assessment of
German reunification.
   Negative reaction to the April jobs report, which the
market interpreted as the death knell for a short-term
tightening of U.S. interest rates, carried the dollar lower
against nearly all other major currencies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sunday's Group of Seven meeting of finance ministers and
central bankers in Washington generally was dismissed by
participants, due to a lack of new initiatives announced by
the G-7 officials.
   The failure of G-7 monetary officials to voice strong
support of the yen added to the yen's weakness, traders said.
G-7 monetary officials reaffirmed that the low value of the
yen is a problem, but declined to take action in support of
the Japanese currency.
   The yen closed marginally higher against the dollar but
lower against the mark and pound.
   At the same time, statements yesterday by Bonn monetary
officials that reunification with East Germany won't
seriously burden West Germany's economy served to reassure
traders.
   "The {West} Germans are now addressing concerns that the
market had about inflation . . . . They've come a long way
since they first began talking about a 1-to-1 conversion
rate" for all East German marks, said Gabriele Schmitt, a
trader at Bank of New York.
   Earlier yesterday, West German central bank President Karl
Otto Poehl said it is "realistic" to assume that
reunification and the plan for replacing the East German
currency with the mark won't intensify inflationary pressures
on the West German economy.
   In the same positive vein, West German Finance Minister
Theo Waigel said the country's capital markets won't be
strained by the restructuring of the East German economy
along Western lines. He added that stability of the mark and
of government finances is assured.
   Mr. Waigel's comments yesterday paralleled those he made
at the weekend G-7 meeting, where monetary officials agreed
that German monetary and economic unification will contribute
to "noninflationary" growth in the global economy.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6558 marks, down from 1.6662 marks late Friday, and at
158.19 yen, down from 158.25 yen late Friday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6685, up from $1.6630 Friday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the U.S. currency was
quoted at 158.10 yen, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 157.80
yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6560 marks.
   A labor settlement announced Friday between employers and
the large IG Metall workers union in the Stuttgart area
bolstered the mark for the second trading day in a row,
participants said. The settlement reduced market worries that
the 2,680,000-member union might launch a nationwide strike,
they said.
   The yen lost ground against most other units amid a lack
of news, especially about any Japanese interest-rate rise,
which the market still deems necessary for the yen to recover
from its doldrums.
   The mark capitalized on the yen's weakness, rising to
95.52 yen late yesterday in New York from 95.02 yen late
Friday. Sterling finished the day at 263.87 yen, up from
263.33 yen.
   While this week's auctions of Treasury debt aren't
expected to move currency markets, Tokyo dealers said demand
for the dollar against the yen may increase when secondary
trading in the new issues gets under way.
   Japanese institutions interested in taking part in the
primary auctions of the debt are seen as having largely
finished making their dollar purchases, according to dealers
in Tokyo.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $371.90 an ounce, up $1. Estimated volume
was a light 1.8 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $372.30 an ounce.

   Walt Disney May Need a Gee-Whiz Encore
   As Investors Look for It to Maintain Magic

   NEW YORK -- Is Mickey Mouse headed for a trap?
   Several Wall Street analysts and money managers are
worried that this summer could prove disappointing for Walt
Disney shareholders. Even if Disney's numbers are good, they
warn, all the hoopla about competitors MCA and Paramount
could hurt the short-term performance of Disney stock.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Disney could be a victim of its own success. In the past
six years it has gone from dog to darling on Wall Street.
Managers led by Michael Eisner, installed after the company
bought out unwelcome investor Saul Steinberg, have
revitalized Disney's theme park and movie and television
production businesses. The performance landed Eisner on the
cover of Time magazine -- an unusual honor for a corporate
hired hand -- and powered Disney shares to a gain of more
than sevenfold.
   Given the lofty expectations now built into the stock
price, some analysts and investors say it will be tough for
Disney to make it through the next few quarters without a
letdown.
   "Expectations as to how Disney will do are still too
high," says Christopher Dixon, an analyst with Kidder
Peabody. But because Mr. Dixon believes Disney is "superbly
positioned" for the 1990s, he adds: "Should disappointed
expectations drive Disney stock down, long-term investors
should use that as a buying opportunity."
   Some big long-term shareholders have been taking profits
since Disney shares soared above 130 last summer. They closed
yesterday at 113 1/4, up 1/2.
   Lincoln Capital Management, Chicago, which last year had
about 4.5% of its $4 billion stock fund invested in 1.7
million shares of Disney, cut its position to zero by the end
of April. Parker Hall, president, says the decision to sell
"principally was based on the stock price and a feeling that
a lot of areas of their business were cyclically going well."
He adds: "Comparisons against their attendance at the parks
and the extraordinary things they've done with movies would
be hard to replicate."
   What's going to make the comparisons tough? First, the
Disney-MGM studio tour, which opened in May 1989, has been
drawing capacity crowds to Orlando, Fla., and pumping up
Disney's theme park attendance and profits. But starting this
month, the studio tour will be competing against itself in
the year-to-year comparisons. To boost attendance, Disney has
extended the hours the studio tour is open. But the real kick
won't come until 1993, when a planned doubling of the studio
tour facility is to be completed.
   Coming up much sooner is the June 7 grand opening of the
competing Universal Studios tour in Orlando. Built by
Disney's archrival MCA, it drew high marks from a tramload of
analysts. Alan Kassan of Morgan Stanley believes the
Universal Florida tour, which includes King Kong and Jaws,
will do "quite well." At Disney, theme parks and resorts
accounted for 64% of 1989 operating earnings.
   Though many analysts believe the Universal tour will help
boost attendance at Disney World and the Disney-MGM tour over
the long term by drawing more people to Orlando, they worry
about the short run. Warren Shaw, managing director of
Chancellor Capital Management, New York, which sold about
250,000 Disney shares in the fourth quarter and still holds
685,000, says, "The main concern or negative here, near-term,
is negative psychological reaction to the MCA studio tour
opening."
   Mr. Shaw notes that at its peak last year, Disney was
trading at 25 to 30 times earnings, an extraordinary
multiple. Currently, Disney is trading at about 21 times its
most recent 12-month earnings and about 18 times estimated
fiscal 1990 earnings.
   Disney declines to comment, but its management has set a
goal of increasing per-share earnings 20% a year over any
five-year period. Earnings per share increased more than 30%
in fiscal 1988 and 1989, but only 18% in the first six months
of fiscal 1990.
   The wild card in Disney's hand this summer is "Dick
Tracy," a movie starring Warren Beatty and Madonna. Opening
June 15, it could be this summer's "Batman," which caused the
acquisitive execs at Time Inc. to say "Holy Box Office" as
they rushed to buy Warner Communications. Both stars have
graced some expensive flops, notably Mr. Beatty's "Ishtar."
Then again, none of those films were produced by Disney. Nor
will "Dick Tracy" give Madonna the kind of exposure she's had
in Vanity Fair magazine and on MTV. "Dick Tracy" won't get a
rating more risque than PG.
   "Dick Tracy" isn't finished yet, so even the theater
owners haven't seen it, a Disney spokeswoman says. It will be
competing with "Days of Thunder," starring Tom Cruise, from
Paramount, and "Back to the Future III" from Universal. And
as Mr. Dixon of Kidder notes, "whether `Dick Tracy' is
successful or not, it will have very little impact on
Disney's bottom line." However, he says, "the psychological
impact could be hurtful."

i486 chip.
   The family includes workstations that operate at 27
million instructions per second and are 32% faster than most
personal computers based on a slower version of the i486
chip, NCR said. The new computers are targeted for such
"computer-intensive" applications as economic and financial
modeling, computer-aided design, graphics and animation, the
Dayton, Ohio-based computer maker added.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new computers can use the UNIX, MS OS/2 and DOS
operating systems, NCR said. Prices start at $14,195 for a
desktop personal computer called the PC486/MC33 system.
Prices for a network and database "server" for multiple
users, called the S486/MC33, start at $16,195.
   The new computers will be available in July, NCR said.

   Bush Would Take Part in Discussions
   On Deficit Cuts Without Preconditions

   WASHINGTON -- The White House said President Bush would
enter deficit-cutting talks without preconditions, but
refused to elaborate on comments by Republican leaders in the
House and Senate that the president is prepared to negotiate
on tax increases.
   In the first White House comment on Mr. Bush's Sunday
night meeting with four top congressional leaders, spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Mr. Bush agreed only to accept a
suggestion by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D.,
Maine) that any talks begin with no conditions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rather than discuss specifics, Mr. Fitzwater said, the
participants agreed "to stick to the phrase of `no
preconditions' and begin an open debate that is unfettered
with conclusions about positions taken in the past." But he
added, "the tax matter was not discussed in the meeting
{Sunday}. The president's . . . philosophy on this issue is
quite well-known."
   Mr. Fitzwater's comments underscore the delicacy of a
budget summit that, if successful, requires both parties to
embrace unpopular tax increases and spending cuts in order to
narrow the deficit significantly. White House Budget Director
Richard Darman estimates that $45 billion to $55 billion in
savings are needed to reach the Gramm-Rudman budget law's
deficit target of $64 billion for the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.) suggested
Sunday that -- in the current political context -- the
president's statement that "everything is on the table"
demonstrates his willingness to accept taxes. Senate
Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas made similar
statements.
   Sen. Mitchell, however, offered no confirmation. "I
recognize the desire to draw large and sweeping conclusions,"
Sen. Mitchell told reporters yesterday. "I have no basis for
doing so."
   "It could be a sea change if the leadership of the
Congress goes to the table understanding that everything is
on the table," said New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici, senior
Republican on the Budget Committee.
   Sen. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.)
jointly briefed other congressional leaders yesterday on
their meeting with Mr. Bush. They plan separate meetings with
rank-and-file members today, hoping to build support for
whatever pact emerges from a budget summit.
   Democrats remain skeptical toward White House overtures.
In a stormy meeting of the House Democratic whip organization
last week, the leadership was forced to concede that it had
already been too trusting of their Republican opponents,
allowing them to avoid putting Mr. Bush's budget to a vote on
the House floor. Similar cynicism applies to talk now that
Mr. Bush has put taxes on the table, and some Democrats
assume that whatever the administration agrees to will be
hidden behind phrases such as "revenue enhancements."
   "When the president says taxes, it will have several
syllables," Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen
(D., Texas) said yesterday.
   As the majority party, Democrats know that they can't
afford to walk away from an invitation to talks, and there is
a sense that the administration also is under stiff pressure.
It needs an agreement both to aid the economy by relieving
pressure on interest rates and to avoid across-the-board
budget cuts under Gramm-Rudman this fall that could be so
large they hurt the administration's Pentagon and foreign-aid
priorities.
   The White House is now saying that the federal debt
ceiling must be raised in July, earlier than previously
forecast. And at the Sunday meeting, White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu suggested setting target dates for
different stages of the negotiations to expedite them, one
lawmaker said.
   Separately, the newest member of the Finance Committee,
Sen. John Breaux, asserted that Mr. Bush knows that tax
increases of some sort are necessary. "Reality has now set
in, as opposed to politics," he said. "He would like . . .
aggressive efforts on the part of the Democrats insisting on
it, which I don't think is going to happen." Sen. Breaux, a
Louisiana Democrat, said he would prefer a $5-a-barrel
oil-import fee to raising individual income-tax rates.
   Energy taxes of all sorts are mentioned with increasing
frequency in Washington. "When you take all the husks off,"
said former Reagan campaign manager John Sears, "what he {Mr.
Bush} is really saying is `no change in the income tax.' He'd
stand for some other taxes like an energy tax." Mr. Sears
sees political wisdom in that distinction. "Really what most
people think about when they think about taxes is the income
tax," he said.
   Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Bush and the leaders agreed that,
if talks begin, any participant can bring up any subject,
talks will continue without any deadline as long as both
sides find them productive, and discussions will be kept as
secret as possible.
   The prospect of a bipartisan compromise pact may delay
further action on Democratic-backed budget plans. Senate
staffers said Senate leaders are likely to delay debate on
the Budget Committee's $43 billion fiscal 1991
deficit-reduction package to see how talks are going. Sen.
Mitchell said no decision on that has been made, while Sen.
Domenici said he sees no merit in taking up the committee's
plan at this time.
   The House Ways and Means Committee has stopped work on tax
bills pending the outcome of a summit, but the staff is
preparing both tax-increase and spending-cut options for
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) to raise at a summit.
Rep. Rostenkowski also is preparing to submit a bill this
week that would replace the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting law
with his own plan to force budget reductions and tax
increases, using the debt ceiling as the lever. It also would
take the Social Security surplus out of the deficit
calculation. The Bush administration has resisted repealing
Gramm-Rudman, but wants to change it.
   In the Senate, aides expect talks to begin on the process
of the summit, and are optimistic that such talks could
produce something significant. At a breakfast meeting of
Democratic staff directors in the Senate yesterday morning,
the mood was upbeat. "People seem to be taking it seriously,
it's got possibilities," one participant said. "There was no
reluctance to get down and roll up the sleeves."

indefinitely.
   The bonds were to be sold in European capital markets.

   Tongyang is a flagship of Hyosung Business Group. A
company official said the recently poor performance of the
local stock market is partly responsible for the postponement
of the issue. Several South Korean firms are delaying the
issue of equity-related overseas bonds, fearing the bearish
stock market would result in cool acceptance by international
investors.
   Early last week, the local stock market fell to the lowest
level in about 19 months on investors' concerns about a
faltering economy and social and political unrest.
   Share prices have recovered since last Tuesday because of
the government's pledge to support the market. However, the
market's key index is still about 10% down from the beginning
of the year.

   The contract, the second-largest commercial computer
contract ever received by AT&amp;T, also calls for the company to
maintain computer equipment used by the airline from other
suppliers.
   The idea, said Robert O. Wagner, Pan Am's vice president
of information services, is to create the "airport of the
future" where ticket issuing, baggage handling and boarding
are automated.

   Failure of Proxy
   Comes Amid Chills
   In Icahn's Empire

   `Poison Pill,' TWA Woes
   Replace Takeover Bids;
   Still, There's Cash Left

   NEW YORK -- Carl Icahn's failure to win a referendum of
USX Corp. shareholders leaves the investor holding a 13.3%
block of USX stock that has less value than when he launched
his proxy campaign two months ago.
   Wall Street takeover experts expect Mr. Icahn to continue
to try to maneuver to boost the value of his USX stock, which
he acquired for roughly $800 million, possibly by encouraging
an energy company to bid for USX's Marathon Oil unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an interview, Mr. Icahn said he had gained "a nucleus
of supportive shareholders, and we intend to stay in touch
with everybody." He wouldn't comment on any effort he may
make to attract a partner to bid for Marathon.
   But Mr. Icahn is handicapped by a poison-pill
anti-takeover device, which effectively bars him from trying
to put further pressure on USX management by boosting his
stake above 15%. He has lost some credibility by falling
short in this vote. At the same time, Mr. Icahn must also
deal with heavy losses at Trans World Airlines, of which he
owns 90%.
   Mr. Icahn needn't despair. He still has roughly $2 billion
in cash, mainly from a sale of Texaco Inc. stock last year,
and is dabbling in investments in the depressed market for
high-risk, high-yield junk bonds as well as companies choking
with too much debt.
   Nor was his loss surprising. Analysts had predicted Mr.
Icahn would lose, because he wasn't offering to buy the
entire company. Mr. Icahn had argued that his proposal for
USX to spin off its steel operations would produce value of
$48 a share.
   But the vote underscores how much the world has changed
since Mr. Icahn acquired 11% of USX in the fall of 1986, just
before Ivan Boesky pleaded guilty in the government's insider
trading investigation and gave prosecutors information that
eventually toppled Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Mr. Icahn's
investment bank.
   With Drexel gone and the market for junk bonds in a state
of near-collapse, Mr. Icahn lacked access to financing that
would have allowed him to threaten a hostile bid for USX.
That "takes a lot of the sharpness out of his teeth," said
Michael Lamb, president of Wealth Monitors Inc., a Kansas
City, Mo., newsletter that tracks big investors. "The whole
junk-bond market is topsy-turvy, and that throws out the
window a lot of the pressure that agressive investors were
able to put on management."
   Mr. Icahn disputed Mr. Lamb's contention that the loss of
Drexel has reduced his ability to put pressure on USX
management, saying, "I think $2 billion in cash is a pretty
good tooth."
   When Mr. Icahn announced his referendum on March 8, USX
stock rose $1 a share to $36.625. Yesterday, USX shares fell
50 cents to $33.50 in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. The reasons include falling oil prices, lower
expected prices for energy assets USX is selling, and Mr.
Icahn's expected proxy loss.
   Although Mr. Icahn is showing a substantial paper profit
on his stake, which he acquired for less than $24 a share, he
remains stuck in the position with no clear exit. What's
more, his long holding period has reduced his indicated
return on an $800 million investment to roughly 12% annually
-- not much different than he could have obtained in a stock
index mutual fund. Mr. Icahn said that buying on margin --
using borrowed funds to finance half his original
purchase-has boosted his return to roughly 23%.
   And if Mr. Icahn tried to sell his big USX stake, traders
say, he might well have to accept less than the current
market price, unless he could find an energy company willing
to buy the block as a first step toward a bid for control.
   Last summer, Mr. Icahn surprised traders by selling a much
larger block of Texaco stock for about $2 billion, at only a
slight discount to the market price. However, Texaco's stock
price at the time had been propped up by two large one-time
dividends, which Texaco had agreed to pay during a proxy
battle Mr. Icahn waged unsuccessfully to oust management.
   Although Mr. Icahn is still sitting on the cash from that
sale, he faces a cash drain at Trans World Airlines because
of rising interest costs from $2.8 billion in debt. Mr. Icahn
has been selling assets and refinancing aircraft to make debt
repayments.
   TWA reported a profit of about $250 million in 1988,
thanks partly to big gains on Mr. Icahn's Texaco stake. But
last year the airline had a loss of nearly $300 million. Mr.
Icahn said TWA's 1989 loss didn't include more than $100
million in unrealized investment profits.
   While Mr. Icahn has recovered his investment in TWA by
piling more debt on the airline, he remains locked in a
bitter battle with its unions, and is seeking a 10% pay cut
from the pilots. The airline continues to devour his time,
and remains important to his credibility in future
investments.

   RWE AG said its group profit rose in the first nine months
of fiscal 1990 on a 6.2% rise in sales.
   The West German energy concern said group sales in the
period ended March 31 rose to around 31 billion marks ($18.61
billion) from 29 billion marks a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Speaking at the company's annual shareholding meeting,
Chairman Friedhelm Gieske didn't give any profit figures. But
citing the group's earnings-oriented dividend policy, he
indicated a possible increase in the fiscal 1990 dividend
from nine marks a share. RWE will also increase its special
reserve fund for the first time since 1984, Mr. Gieske said.
   Full-year sales are expected to climb 13% to 43.8 billion
marks from 38.9 billion marks in fiscal 1989, partly
reflecting the partial consolidation of construction group
Hochtief AG, in which RWE boosted its stake to 56% from 46%
this year by buying a 10% interest from Commerzbank AG.

with an agreement to buy Cartera's 12.5% holding of its
shares and sell them to other buyers.
   A Cartera spokesman said the agreement values Cartera's

Central is to pay 29.2 billion pesetas immediately and the
balance, plus annual interest of 15%, before May 31, 1991.
</LP>

   Banco Central said it has been in discussions with a
number of institutions with a view to placing the shares,
either for these institutions to hold them in their own
portfolio or for their flotation on international markets.
   Banco Central gave no further details, but sources close
to the bank said that they understood that agreements for the
transfer of the shares had already been reached. Though the
agreement is subject to the approval of the Bank of Spain and
the stock exchange commission, Banco Central doesn't expect
this to pose any problem, the sources said.

   CARMEL, Calif. -- Landmark Land Co. said the Office of
Thrift Supervision is objecting to its plans for financing
the sale of a major part of its real estate and resort
holdings for nearly $1 billion.
   The move casts doubt upon nearly $500 million in expected
pretax profit from the proposed transaction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The planned sale of the company's premier golf, tennis and
development properties to California developer Barry G. Hon
for $967 million called for Landmark's Oak Tree Savings Bank
unit to finance the sale.
   However, in a supervisory objection letter the agency
expressed "concern we'd have too high a percentage of our
assets, about 20%, tied up in one borrower," said Gerland G.
Barton, Landmark's president. "I'm surprised, since we're
getting about 25% down and we'd have a first mortgage on the
property," Mr. Barton added.
   Landmark and Mr. Hon are attempting to restructure the
proposed transaction to address the agency's concerns.
   Inability to recast the deal to the agency's satisfaction
would kill the sale, Landmark said, and cancel out an
expected $470 million in pretax profit that would have
resulted from closing the transaction.
   Moreover, Landmark said it had hoped the sale would help
it satisfy all capital requirements of the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act.
   Landmark's Mr. Barton said Mr. Hon, the owner of Hon
Development Co., of Laguna Hills, Calif., was seeking
alternative financing for the planned purchase. He "is coming
back with a proposal he anticipates will be acceptable," he
said.

   New Line Cinema Corp. reported it swung to a profit in the

"House Party" and "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."
   New Line, a New York-based independent producer and
distributor of movies, earned $739,000, or 11 cents a share,
compared with a net loss of $287,000, or four cents a share,
a year earlier. Revenue more than doubled to $29 million from
$11.1 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   New Line credited the results to the first 23 days of
"House Party," which opened March 9; and the first two days
of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," which opened on March 30.
To date, "House Party" has grossed more than $22 million, and
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" has grossed more than $100
million.
   New Line expects the bulk of theatrical distribution
revenue for the Turtles movie to be recorded in the second
quarter. The company expects both movies to provide
additional revenue as they are released in ancillary markets.
   In trading on the American Stock Exchange, New Line closed
Monday at $10.375, up 25 cents.

   Both European aircraft builders, as well as
government-funded studies in the U.S. and Japan, have been
looking at supersonic and "hypersonic" aircraft projects for
months. In particular, Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
are looking at the potential of developing what they call a
high-speed civil transport, or HSCT. Four years ago, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration began funding
research into the area, and both manufacturers are convinced
that a market exists for an aircraft that could carry 250 to
300 passengers up to 6,500 miles at nearly 2.5 times the
speed of sound.
   But no plane has been configured at this point. NASA is
now in the midst of a $25 million study to evaluate the
environmental problems that such an aircraft could cause:
Excessive engine noise, ozone depletion and sonic booms. "We
don't see anything flying before the turn of the century,"
said a spokesman for Seattle-based Boeing, which two decades
ago watched as its supersonic transport program was canceled
due in large part to economic uncertainties.
   In addition, the U.S. Air Force, in cooperation with U.S.
aerospace companies, is developing what it calls the National
AeroSpace Plane, which would be capable of flying in low
Earth orbit at 25 times the speed of sound. And Japan late
last year invited U.S. and other foreign participation in a
$200 million Tokyo-funded project to develop an engine for a
Japanese civil transport plane that would fly at five times
the speed of sound.

   Negotiating With 3 U.S. Shops

   Della Femina McNamee WCRS's French parent is negotiating
with three midsized U.S. shops in a bid to expand its U.S.
empire.
   Jerry Della Femina, Della Femina McNamee's garrulous
chairman, confirmed the discussions and said all three
agencies bill in the $250 million to $350 million range. He
declined to identify them but said all are based in New York
and Della Femina's French parent, Eurocom, might buy as many
as two of them. The agencies would become part of Eurocom
WCRS Della Femina Ball, or EWDB, the Eurocom unit that owns
Della Femina.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Eurocom last year bought 60% of EWDB from WCRS Group in
the U.K., which retains a 40% stake. Industry executives
believe Eurocom ultimately will try to buy 100% of the agency
group. Eurocom executives couldn't be reached.
   Some industry executives questioned whether Eurocom would
have the resources to pursue agencies in the $250 million to
$350 million range. Its most recent approaches have been on a
smaller scale, such as discussions, since ended, to buy Los
Angeles-based Keye/Donna/Pearlstein's tiny New York office.
   Mr. Della Femina, though, said Eurocom was intent on
expanding its agencies through both internal growth and
acquisitions. He recalled a recent speech he gave in France
in which he brashly proclaimed that EWDB would become one of
the top five agencies in the world within three years. After
the speech, Eurocom's top executive, Alain de Pouzilhac,
"corrected me. He said you're wrong -- we're going to be in
the top three."
   Mr. Della Femina's agency could use a billings boost from
acquisitions right now. Its New York office has won some
accounts this year, including business from Ramada Inns and
Schering-Plough. But the merger of its Boston office with
sister agency HBM/Creamer was rocky, culminating with the
defection of the $22 million Parker Bros. toy account. Mr.
Della Femina said that, depending on which agency is
acquired, it would either become a division of Della Femina
or remain independent under the EWDB umbrella.
   Eurocom's shopping spree comes at a particularly
acquisitive time for French ad agencies. British agencies,
long the acquisition champions, dropped the ball in the past
year. They've fallen out of favor with British investors in
the wake of severe financial problems at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi,
and their low stock prices have made raising money for
acquisitions all but impossible. The French, on the other
hand, are riding high in their home territory, making raising
funds that much easier.
   "It's their turn," said Alan Gottesman, an analyst with
PaineWebber. Added Mr. Della Femina: "It's definitely the
beginning of the French period of advertising. The French
star is rising in this business, and the British star is
starting to descend."
   Just last month, French agency group Boulet Dru Dupuy
Petit agreed to buy 40% of ad agency Wells, Rich, Greene,
whose clients include IBM and Hertz. In recent years,
Publicis, another French ad agency, forged an alliance with
Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications. And Eurocom itself has
been on the prowl, and not just in the U.S. Aside from buying
London-based WCRS's ad operations, it has been rumored in
recent months to be acquiring a stake in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
   It wasn't clear which agencies Eurocom has contacted here.
Several midsized shops said they hadn't been approached,
including Rosenfeld, Sirowitz, Humphrey & Strauss; Griffin
Bacal; Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor; and Korey, Kay &amp;
Partners. Frank Ginsberg, president of Avrett, Free &amp;
Ginsberg, said Eurocom approached his agency several years
ago but not recently.
   In any case, Eurocom clearly isn't the only French agency
scouting around on these shores in an attempt to become an

   Philip Morris Cos. today introduces "Phase II" of its ad
campaign celebrating the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights.
   The New York-based food and tobacco giant kicked off the
campaign late last year with TV and print ads touting themes
of liberty and freedom of expression. Although criticized by
anti-smoking activists as disguised tobacco advertising, the
campaign isn't designed to have any special appeal for
smokers, Philip Morris says.
   With "Phase II," Philip Morris has cast famous Americans
in print ads sharing their modern-day thoughts about the Bill
of Rights. Ads feature actor Charlton Heston, choreographer
Judith Jamison and Benjamin L. Hooks, executive vice
president of the NAACP, among others.
   The print campaign, like the earlier TV ads, was created
by WPP Group agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather. Ads will appear in
newspapers and magazines.

   EARNINGS: Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications, Chicago,
reported first-quarter net income fell 41% to $1.34 million,
or 13 cents a share, from $2.3 million, or 23 cents a share,
in the year-earlier period. Revenue dropped 7% to $72.2
million from $77.3 million in the first quarter of 1989.
Foote Cone said net was off in part because of lower income
from U.S. operations and interest expense relating to its
alliance with France's Publicis. The revenue drop, it said,
was due to the sale of its Golin/Harris public-relations
subsidiary.

   WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund's
policy-making committee agreed to a 50% increase in the
multilateral institution's resources, officials said.
   The decision, which is likely to take up to two years to
implement, was reached at meetings of the IMF's powerful
Interim Committee late yesterday, according to U.S. and
Argentine officials who attended the sessions. It will raise
the resources of the IMF to about $180 billion from a current
level of about $120 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Members of the committee also agreed to a U.S.-backed
formula for sorting out close to $4 billion of payments
arrears to the IMF. Under the formula, 11 countries that are
deeply in arrears will be lent further funds by the IMF to
cover their overdue payments but might forfeit gold they
previously pledged to the fund if they fail to honor their
obligations as they work their way out of their difficulties.
   A U.S.-backed proposal to amend the IMF's articles to
allow the organization to suspend member countries that are
severely delinquent on their debts also was accepted by the
committee.
   The committee also agreed that it will next consider the
issue of replenishing the IMF's resources in 1993, a move
requested by several developing nations. The U.S. and other
industrial nations had proposed 1995 for such consideration.
The IMF gathers its resources by requiring its 152 member
nations to subscribe to quotas. In an exchange of assets,
member countries pledge some of their reserves to fulfill
their quotas.

   NEW YORK -- Christie's International PLC reported somewhat
disappointing results from its evening sale of contemporary
art here last night.
   For the first night of the two-week spring auction season,
roughly one-third of the works of art didn't sell. The total
for the sale came in at $40.2 million, well below the firm's
lowest estimate of $50 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, strong bidding by Japanese collectors and
investors allayed concerns of some dealers that the Tokyo
stock market's recent decline would trim demand from that
usually lucrative area. The auction house said Asian
investors were responsible for 39% of the dollar total of the
art works sold, compared with 7% at Christie's previous major
sale of contemporary art in November. A Japanese bidder paid
$1.1 million for Andy Warhol's "Myths", a giant silk-screen
of pop-culture icons. The price fell within Christie's
estimated range.
   The top-selling piece at the auction was Roy
Lichtenstein's "Kiss II," a large oil on canvas in comic-book
style, which sold for $6.1 million, also within the estimated
range.
   Sotheby's Holdings Inc. is to hold its auction of
contemporary art this evening.

   Lomas Takes
   Charge Totaling
   $505.5 Million

   Firm Admits Its Portfolio
   Of Real Estate Is Shakier
   Than Earlier Estimated

   DALLAS -- Lomas Financial Corp., admitting that its
real-estate portfolio is far shakier than it had previously
estimated, said it took a $505.5 million special charge in
its fiscal third quarter ended March 31, resulting in a $500
million loss for the period.
   The big financial-services and real-estate concern said
about $286 million of the reserve, or 56%, stems from its
real-estate holdings, while an additional $74 million
reflects a write-down of the company's short-term
construction and development loans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Jess Hay, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
move -- which comes atop a similar $253 million special
charge last July -- reflects "the continuing weakening of the
country's real-estate markets" and a "severe" constriction of
loans available to real-estate investors. "Liquidity within
the industry is at one of its lowest points since World War
II," he added.
   Lomas said another $49 million of the total stems from the
estimated cost of completing the company's new mortgage loan
servicing system and related write-offs, while the remaining
$97 million covers, among other things, investments in
discontinued subsidiary operations. The company added that it
also took a "normal" quarterly provision for possible losses
of $7.7 million.
   Analysts were divided on whether even such a massive hit
will be enough to clean up Lomas's tarnished balance sheet.
Some investors have accused the company, which is operating
under federal bankruptcy-court protection from creditors, of
overpaying for certain assets it acquired during an expansion
binge a few years ago, and then exaggerating their true worth
in financial statements.
   Leigh Walzer, an analyst with R.D. Smith &amp; Co., which
trades securities of troubled companies, said the write-off
was "in the right ballpark" and should dispel market concerns
about disparities between the company's book value and market
value.
   But Jay Lustig, an analyst at Drake Capital Securities
Inc., Santa Monica, Calif., disputed Lomas's estimates. "In
my opinion, I think they've got at least another $500 million
to go as far as total asset write-downs," he said.
   Mr. Lustig added that he expects holders of Lomas's
subordinated debt to "probably wind up with something less
than 10 cents on the dollar," and for equity holders to be
wiped out.
   The news, which came out after the close of trading,
didn't affect the price of the company's securities. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lomas stock
closed unchanged at 56.25 cents. Meanwhile, subordinated debt
traded at about 26 cents on the dollar.
   Mr. Hay said that, despite the bad news, "I continue to
believe that we're going to emerge with a viable, profitable
operation" focusing on mortgage loan servicing. He said the
company hopes to complete a reorganization plan in late June.
   In the fiscal third quarter, revenue fell 16% to $67.8
million from $80.7 million. In the year-ago period, the
company reported a net loss of $12.4 million. For the latest
nine months, Lomas reported a net loss of $651.4 million on
revenue of $220.1 million, against net income of $5.7 million
on revenue of $256.8 million a year before.

   Immunex Corp. said one-time licensing and option fees from
two major business partners boosted the company to a
first-quarter profit of $5.1 millon, or 54 cents a share.
   The Seattle-based biotechnology concern recorded a
year-ago loss of $1.1 million, or 14 cents a share.
First-quarter revenue more than doubled to $15.3 million,
from $6.9 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The performance resulted largely from the repurchase by
Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. of an Immmunex option to manufacture
the protein IL-2 for sale by Roche in the U.S. Immunex also
cited the licensing by Behringwerke AG of manufacturing and
marketing rights in Japan to a package of Immunex receptor
products.
   In addition, Immunex said, first-quarter performance
improved due to an increase in sales to collaborators of
products for clinical trials. The products were
granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and
interleukin-4.
   Stephen A. Duzan, chairman and chief executive officer,
said that despite the quarterly profit, the company expects
to record a loss for the 1990 year due to planned increases
in spending for scientific, clinical and marketing
activities.

   California Aide's Findings on Initiative
   For Insurance Overhaul Back Industry
   ----

INSURANCE (INS)
</IN>
<LP>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- In a potentially devastating blow to
proponents of Proposition 103, a hearing officer interpreted
the insurance-overhaul initiative in a way that would
probably kill the prospect of significant refunds to
consumers and considerably limit the authority of California
insurance regulators to keep down future rates.
   Administrative law judge William Fernandez held that
individual insurers needn't comply with a one-time 20%
rollback provision of Proposition 103 if they can show that
the rollback would deprive them of a 13.2% rate of return. He
also recommended limits on certain expenses in computing
returns and that returns be based on a broad measure of a
company's California earnings, rather than on specific
product lines. But the rate is more generous than an 11.2%
rate urged by state insurance regulators and consumer
advocates during recent hearings before the officer, and some
observers believe it will doom rollbacks under the
initiative.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Under this decision, it is unlikely that California's
ratepayers would see a dime of the rollbacks to which they
are entitled," said state attorney general John Van de Kamp.
   "Some people thought the possibility of rollbacks was on
life-support prior to this decision. Well, now the judge has
put his foot down on the air hose," said Steve Miller, who is
president of the Insurance Consumer Action Network, a
nonprofit Los Angeles public interest group, as well as a
consultant to the state insurance department. He added of the
officer's findings in general, "It is a much more
business-as-usual approach than we would have liked."
   In addition, the officer rejected consumer-group arguments
that Proposition 103 empowered state authorities to engage in
detailed, public-utility-styled regulation of the industry,
including mandatory ceilings on certain kinds of expenses.
Such caps would generally "result in imposing actuarially
unsound rates throughout the California insurance industry,"
Mr. Fernandez said. He also held that, for future
rate-setting purposes, insurers should be entitled to earn a
rate of return ranging between 11.2% and 19%, again a broader
range than consumer groups and regulators had urged.
   "The judge has recognized that there are many different
ways to set and regulate rates, and that so long as a rate is
economically and actuarially sound, then it should be
approved," said David Balabanian, a San Francisco lawyer for
Fireman's Fund Corp. "He has held that the department has no
authority to second-guess how an insurer operates its
business."
   The findings are merely a recommendation to the state
insurance department, which is to devise final proposed
regulations in the next few months. But some observers said
the findings would be hard to ignore and noted that the
department has had legal trouble when it has reversed
administrative-law findings in other Proposition 103-related
matters.
   "This is a farce. Between this and the decision last week,
it is as if Proposition 103 was never passed," said Harvey
Rosenfield, a Los Angeles consumer activist and organizer of
the initiative's November 1988 campaign drive.
   Last week, a Los Angeles judge invalidated a key state
insurance department regulation issued under Proposition 103
that would have limited the ability of insurers to use
customers' home addresses in figuring rates. Critics have
charged that such "territorial rating" results in unduly high
rates for drivers in congested urban centers as well as
discrimination against the poor and minorities.
   Mr. Fernandez, accepting the arguments of insurers, held
that regulating insurers like public utilities would be
inappropriate because insurers don't have a "natural
monopoly" on the services they provide. Consumer groups had
argued that insurers effectively had such power because state
law requires motorists to purchase coverage.
   The hearing officer did urge that certain expenses,
including political contributions and legal judgments, be
excluded in determining rates, although some insurance
lawyers said they saw an escape hatch through which such
costs might still be included. He also rejected an
insurance-department attempt to impose generalized caps on
expenses and establish broad "efficiency standards," saying
that the initiative didn't give the department such
affirmative power.
   The attempt to divine appropriate rates of returns for
insurers was necessitated by a state supreme court ruling
last year that basically upheld Proposition 103, but held
that it couldn't be implemented in such a way as to deprive
insurers of a "fair and reasonable rate of return," which the
court failed to further define.
   Under state law, the state insurance commissioner has
until mid-August to render a final decision, although most
observers believe she won't wait that long. Some lawyers in
the case expect all issues relating to Proposition 103 to be
set for trial in July, with an appellate court ruling due
roughly around the two-year anniversary of the initiative in
November.
   Mr. Fernandez has been a somewhat controversial figure.
Recently, Mr. Van de Kamp asked that the officer disqualify
himself from the matter because his wife is an insurance
industry lawyer, among other grounds. Yesterday, Mr.
Fernandez dismissed the request to step aside, denying any
conflict and saying that his disqualification at this point
would be "irresponsible," coming after five months of
hearings.

   Tokyo stocks surged as the steadier yen helped to boost
investor confidence and a healthy amount of buying pushed
prices higher, traders said.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 782.63 points to
30956.27. The index advanced 483.81 points Wednesday. The
market was closed Thursday and Friday for holidays.

   The London market was closed yesterday for a holiday.
   In Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index closed the morning
session at 30982.82, up 26.55 points.
   Monday's volume on Tokyo's first section was estimated at
600 million shares, up from 482.4 million shares Wednesday.
Advancers widely outpaced decliners 867 to 122, with 112
issues unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section jumped 48.68 points, or 2.17%, to 2296.49.
   The second section index surged 48.40 points, or 1.35%, to
close at 3628.36. Volume was estimated at nine million
shares, down from 9.5 million shares Wednesday.
   Traders said that the stabler yen encouraged solid buying
yesterday, in particular by individual investors and Japanese
fund managers.
   Moreover, investors were cheered by Sunday's Group of
Seven statement, which called for continued cooperation among
members on exchange rates.
   Mahmoud Ghaemmaghami, manager of research and a portfolio
adviser at WestLB Securities Pacific Ltd., had predicted in
his daily market outlook last week that the market would see
a short rally yesterday, reasoning that the yen would
strengthen on the G-7 summit.
   The G-7 meeting focused on determining directions for the
currencies, a topic that can be interpreted in different
ways, Mr. Ghaemmaghami said.
   For example, Stephen Good, a representative in Japanese
equity sales at McIntosh Securities, said that investors may
re-evaluate their yen-denominated assets in light of the
weekend G-7 talks, reasoning that the U.S. won't likely
tighten monetary policy in the short term.
   Mr. Ghaemmaghami said that this scenario is quite
possible. "If {global} interest rates remain at current
levels, we could see some outflow of money from the U.S. to
Japan," he added, "and because Japan {equity} has depreciated
sharply, one can expect a reasonable return."
   Although he doesn't expect interest rates to rise for at
least one month, another Japanese official discount rate
increase can be expected if West Germany decides to raise its
official rate, Mr. Ghaemmaghami said.
   Yesterday's market provided plenty of buying opportunities
for short-term investors, such as Japanese dealers and fund
managers, he said.
   Much of the rally could be attributed to the fact that
many dealers were holding flat positions ahead of the
holidays, noted Yusuke Fujiwara, head of trading at Baring
Securities Ltd. In addition, he said that approximately two
trillion or three trillion yen ($12.65 billion to $18.98
billion) of pension money was making its way into the market.
   Traders said short-term-oriented fund managers were
interested mostly in largecap, undervalued issues, such as
gas utilities, real estate and oil companies.
   Mr. Ghaemmaghami said that undervalued issues with prices
of less than 1000 yen received the most attention.
   "The market is strong, and the fact that small stocks are
coming back is quite healthy," Mr. Fujiwara said. But he also
noted that the market lacks a leading sector.
   He said nonferrous metal stocks, for one, are viewed as a
good bet. But many sectors are undervalued, and while many
stocks within those sectors will rise, many will not, he
added.
   Some companies linked to niche products are seen as
favorites for foreign investors who are looking for
longer-term securities, Mr. Ghaemmaghami said. But strong
earnings forecasts, low price-earnings ratios, low or no bank
borrowings, and high exports are among the things to check
for shorter-term investments, he said.
   In particular, those stocks that lead the market in their
own products are usually the best bets, he added.
   Meanwhile, electricals aren't seen as very profitable
because of steady gains throughout the volatility of recent
months, Mr. Fujiwara said.
   Real estate companies were mostly higher yesterday. Mitsui
Real Estate gained 70 yen to 1830 yen, while Mitsubishi
Estate added 50 yen to 1660 yen. Sumitomo Realty jumped 40
yen to 1520 yen.
   Railways also were higher. Tokyu gained 50 yen to 1650
yen, Keisei Electric added 80 yen to 1750 yen, and Odakyu
rose 60 yen to 1240 yen.
   Meanwhile, prices closed higher in Sydney, Hong Kong,
Seoul, Manila, Wellington and Singapore, and were lower in
Taipei.
   Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Amsterdam, Stockholm, Milan; lower in Zurich; and mixed in
Brussels. South African gold stocks firmed.

   NATO'S CHIEF REJECTED a call by Moscow for a neutral
united Germany. After conferring with Bush in Washington, the
Western alliance's secretary-general, Manfred Woerner, said a
reunified Germany mustn't only stay in NATO but also remain a
base for its nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union has insisted
on Germany neutrality, and Woerner said it appears that
despite weekend negotiations in Bonn over the future of
Germany, the Kremlin hasn't accepted the allies' plan for the
united German state to be a member of NATO.
   Officials in East and West Berlin set a July 2 target date
to eliminate all border controls and provide full free access
between the two sides of the city.

   LATVIA MOVED to assure Gorbachev that Soviet interests
would be respected. As Soviet tanks and other armored
vehicles rumbled through Riga, the Baltic republic's
legislature prepared a letter to the Kremlin leader saying
that despite its declaration of independence Friday, Latvia
would retain "current constitutional norms." The lawmakers,
who chose a new prime minister, also urged "a fruitful
dialogue." Gorbachev, without specifically mentioning Latvia,
said separatists were pursuing "an irresponsible policy
leading to deadlock."
   Lithuania's agriculture minister said the republic
intended to slash supplies of milk and meat to the Soviet
Union in retaliation for Moscow's sanctions.

   The FBI has arrested two Colombians accused of attempting
to purchase Stinger missiles to use against aircraft carrying
Bogota officials. The pair, who had claimed links to
Medellin-based cocaine traffickers, agreed to make a down
payment of $1 million in drug profits for a "substantial
number" of the anti-aircraft missiles.
                                                                                                       

   Colombian soldiers raided jungle drug labs and airstrips,
seizing more than 13 tons of cocaine in a three-day sweep.
The seizure was called the country's biggest ever.

   Syria said it won't attend an Arab summit in Baghdad,
capital of its archrival Iraq, hindering efforts to resolve
an 11-year feud that has blocked Arab unity. Officials said
Damascus instead proposed that the 22 Arab League foreign
ministers meet in Tunis to decide an alternative summit
venue.

   Rival Christian forces pounded eastern Beirut with
artillery fire, killing at least 21 people and wounding about
40 others, security sources said. It was considered the
heaviest fighting in a month in the battle between forces
loyal to Gen. Michel Aoun and militiamen of the Lebanese
Forces for control of Lebanon's Christian enclave.

   The U.S. rejected ex-hostage Reed's plea for talks for the
release of captives in Lebanon, saying the brutality he
experienced shouldn't be rewarded. Reed said Sunday he had

   Court in Maryland Strikes Down
   `Exclusions' in S&amp;L Insurance Case

   A Maryland state appeals court struck down two key
provisions that so far have limited the exposure of insurance
companies for the negligence of officers and directors of
failed savings and loan associations.
   The decision is the first state appellate ruling in the
nation to address whether the provisions -- known as
"exclusions" in insurance parlance -- should exempt insurance
companies from paying claims against directors and officers
of failed thrifts. Though the case has no binding effect
outside Maryland, it is expected to be widely cited as more
lawsuits are filed nationwide against directors and officers
of failed S&amp;Ls.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Almost all liability policies for directors and officers
of thrifts contain the exclusions struck down in Maryland.
One, known as the "regulatory exclusion," bars coverage when
federal regulators take action. The other known, as the
"insured vs. insured exclusion" exempts insurance companies
from liability when institutions sue their own officers.
   The exclusions have been pivotal in limiting the exposure
of insurance companies for the negligent conduct of officers
responsible for the collapse of thrifts nationwide. But both
were nullified last week by the court of special appeals of
Maryland, in Baltimore. The intermediate state appellate
court ruled that the exclusions are contrary to Maryland
"public policy."
   The state has been bailing out collapsed thrifts since
1985, when it created the Maryland Deposit Insurance Fund to
represent creditors and depositors. Allowing the exclusions
to stand, thus barring a payout by insurers, the court ruled,
would circumvent the state's greater interest in recovering
"every dollar available."
   The court ruled that: "The law in Maryland is well settled
that considerations of public policy are deemed paramount to
private rights. . . . Thus, where the two conflict, private
interest must yield to the public good."
   "From a national perspective, the vitiating of these two
exclusions has tremendous ramifications," said Neil Dilloff,
a partner at the Baltimore law firm of Piper &amp; Marbury, which
won the opinion on behalf of the Maryland fund.
   The case was filed against American Casualty Co. of
Reading, Pa., an underwriter for CNA Insurance Cos., in
Chicago. American's attorneys in Washington weren't available
for comment, but the case is expected to be appealed to
Maryland's highest court, said Mr. Dilloff.
   Michael Lovendusky, counsel and litigation manager for the
American Insurance Association, in Washington, said that if
the ruling is picked up in other states or by federal courts,
it could become impossible for insurance companies to issue
director and officer liability policies. The two exclusions,
said Mr. Lovendusky, have been standard since the 1960s.

   RACIAL ISSUE in major smoking-liability case forces a
change of venue.
   The case of Horton vs. American Tobacco Co. originally
went to trial in January 1988 in Lexington, Miss. The family
of Nathan H. Horton, a housing contractor who died of lung
cancer in 1987, charged the company with "marketing a
defective and unreasonably dangerous product."
   American Tobacco, a unit of American Brands Inc., denied
any responsibility for Mr. Horton's death. But anti-smoking
forces had high hopes for the Horton case. Mississippi state
law is more favorable to plaintiffs than in most other
states. Under its so-called comparative-negligence law, the
jury could have awarded damages to the Horton family even if
it had found the tobacco company bore only 1% of the
responsibility for Mr. Horton's death.
   But the first trial ended in a hung jury amid charges of
jury tampering.
   A second trial began last month but was abruptly halted by
Circuit Court Judge Eugene Bogen in response to complaints
made by American Tobacco. In early April, newspapers,
broadcasters and local civic and political leaders had
received a packet of information from the plaintiffs'
attorneys that included statements that tobacco companies
were targeting blacks and other minorities.
   Judge Bogen, in approving a motion by American Tobacco for
a delay in the case and a change of venue, said the
statements were a "blatant attempt to make an appeal on the
basis of race to the persons in Holmes County, and thus
indirectly on the jury pool."
   After declaring a mistrial and placing a gag order on
lawyers for both sides, Judge Bogen moved the case to the
Lafayette County Circuit Court from Holmes County and set a
Sept. 4 trial date.

   BANKS' LAWSUIT against government of Peru gets court
hearing.
   The group of banks is seeking immediate repayment of $1.2
billion in loans made during the past two decades. The banks
include Citibank, a unit of Citicorp; Bank of Tokyo; Bank of
America, a unit of BankAmerica Corp.; and Chase Manhattan
Bank, a unit of Chase Manhattan Corp. The banks allege that
Peru has been in default on its foreign debt since 1984.
   The suit is believed to be the largest ever filed against
a sovereign government, said Mark A. Cymrot of Cole Corette &amp;
Abrutyn, a lawyer for Peru and Peruvian financial
institutions that are also defendants in the case. Ten other
suits have also been filed against Peru seeking the repayment
of loans.
   An attorney for the banks told federal Judge John Keenan
of New York that his clients would prefer to renegotiate the
loans but were concerned about deadlines that would have
barred legal action.
   The banks filed suit March 2 after learning that an
agreement reached with Peru's government, which would have
effectively extended the deadline, might not be enforceable
under Peruvian law, Henry Weisburg of Shearman &amp; Sterling, an
attorney for several banks, told the court. A spokeswoman for
Citibank, which heads the 10-member Bank Advisory Committee
for Peru, said later that serious negotiations with Peru
haven't taken place for several years.
   Peru has had difficult relations with its foreign
creditors since 1985, when it restricted payments on its
foreign debt to 10% of its export revenue. In December, Peru
paid the International Monetary Fund $42.3 million in overdue
interest payments. In return, the IMF agreed to send a team
to Peru to develop an economic program with the government.
   Mr. Cymrot said the banks's suit ignores the IMF agreement
and that enforcement of a favorable judgment could cut off
Peru's foreign income and strangle the country economically.
"This could undermine democracy in Peru," he said.
   At the hearing, Judge Keenan gave the defendants 60 days
to respond to the banks' allegations.

   RETRIAL BEGINS:  The retrial of Raymond Buckey, the former
California preschool teacher accused of child molestation,
began following a month of jury selection. Mr. Buckey, whose
first criminal trial was the longest and costliest in U.S.
history, will be tried on eight counts of child molestation
involving three girls who were once pupils at the now-defunct
Virginia McMartin Preschool in the community of Manhattan
Beach. Earlier this year, after 28 months of hearing
testimony and three months of deliberations, a jury acquitted
Mr. Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 of 65
counts. The government later decided to retry Mr. Buckey
alone on eight of the 13 counts on which the jury had
deadlocked. The new trial is expected to take at least six
months.

   PRIVATE LESSONS: Baker &amp; McKenzie, a 1,400 lawyer firm
based in Chicago, was picked as a legal adviser to Hungary in
that nation's efforts to sell its state-owned enterprises.
The law firm, which has a two-year-old office in Budapest,
will join investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd Limited, a
unit of Barclays Bank PLC, London, and accounting firm Price
Waterhouse of New York as part of a consortium of
international advisers on the public offering. The consortium
will recommend policies and procedures for the Hungarian
State Property Agency, which was established this year to
oversee the sale of an estimated $32 billion in state
property.

   Demonstrations and Boycott Over Travel Curbs
   Threaten to Disrupt International AIDS Meeting

   SAN FRANCISCO -- AIDS activists angered by federal travel
restrictions are mounting an effective boycott of the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS to be held here in June and
calling for demonstrations.
   The politicization of the conference contrasts with the
first such gathering six years ago in Atlanta. With each
year, the epidemic has grown and its social impact has loomed
larger on the conference agenda.

   The trend seems headed toward a climax June 19 with a
battle over the U.S. policy that blocks people infected with
the human immunodeficiency virus from entering the nation
unless they get a waiver from current visa requirements.
   In response to criticism of the policy, the Bush
administration has whittled a series of compromises,
culminating in creation of a special 10-day visas that will
allow foreigners to attend designated conferences without
having to declare on an immigration form whether they are
HIV-positive. The gesture was tepidly received.
   Dana Van Gorder, conference spokesman, says the action may
even exacerbate the problem. "Clearly, no one would choose to
get a 10-day visa unless they were infected," he says;
requesting one becomes an act of self-exposure.
   And it's not only activists who oppose the travel
restrictions. The U.S. policy has been criticized by the
World Health Organization and by the European Parliament,
which urged the conference be moved to a country that doesn't
discriminate. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, noting
that AIDS isn't casually transmitted, proposed a broad change
in immigration policy, removing AIDS and other sex and
bloodborne ailments from the restricted list.
   The administration contends that because Congress added
AIDS to the contagious disease list, it's up to Congress to
take it off.
   More than 85 groups now plan to boycott the conference,
including the International Red Cross, International Planned
Parenthood, the government of Switzerland, the French
Ministry of Health, the state of Hawaii, the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force, and the Gay Men's Health Crisis of New
York City. The first scientist to isolate the virus, Luc
Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, has hinted he
may stay away in protest. So far there are 6,000 registered
participants -- less than half the attendance of last year's
conference in Montreal.
   "We'd love to go and make a presentation, but morally we
can't," says Robert Bray, spokesman for the National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force. He predicts "a showdown" by WHO over the
administration's policy, as well as "confrontations at the
conference steps."
   He questions the president's refusal to attend a meeting
traditionally opened by heads of state. "The first person to
boycott the Sixth International AIDS Conference was George
Bush. If he can go to Medellin, amid violent drug cartels,
why can he not come to San Francisco?"
   Martin Delaney, the head of San Francisco-based Project
Inform, plans to attend the meeting to give a speech, but
proposes demonstrations. "I'm urging civil disobediance at
ports of entry, to shut down customs at Kennedy Airport and
San Francisco International airport," he says.
   Conference organizers say they're trying to locate space
near Moscone Center, the conference site, where demonstrators
could be isolated to prevent them from blocking traffic.
   "Moscone Center will be a miniversion of a police state,"
predicts Larry Kramer, a New York playwright and a founder of
the activist group AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. In an
editorial entitled "A Call to Riot" that was syndicated in
gay newspapers around the country, Mr. Kramer has called for
major disruptions at the meeting.
   Mr. Kramer acknowledges that the article was "hyperbolic."
But in an interview he said, "It hurts me to say I think the
time for violence has now arrived." He adds: "I don't
personally think I'm the guy with the guts to do it, but I'd
like to see an AIDS terrorist army, like the Irgun which led
to the state of Israel."
   ACT UP officially repudiates such talk. "Our policy is
nonviolent, peaceful demonstrations. We may be noisy, but we
won't throw things or push people," says a spokesman Alan
Beck. "We may stage sit-ins to stop proceedings, but we'll
have nothing to do with {rioting}."
   Violence is shunned by almost every other AIDS
organization. "Our group upholds principles of nonviolence
put forward by Martin Luther King Jr.," says Mr. Bray of the
task force. Moreover, he adds, "Violence isn't pragmatic. We
decry it."
   "Riot would be unfortunate," says Jean McGuire, executive
director of the AIDS Action Counsel, a Washington-based
lobbying group. "I believe the past combination of street
theater, juxtaposed with quiet lobbying behind the scenes has
been a help. The squeaky wheel gets the grease. But anger
only goes so far."
   Paul Volberding, a San Francisco AIDS researcher and
conference organizer, predicts, "The conference is going to
be a good one. It's not a convention, but a scientific
conference, with new material to convey."
   "Those who disrupt the proceedings are doing the world of
AIDS a disservice," he says. "It would be hard to understand
if the groups claiming to represent people with AIDS didn't
allow the exchange of information. They should want to hear
it too. It could save lives."
   June Osborne, head of the National Commission on AIDS and
dean of the University of Michigan's School of Public Health,
is lobbying for an end to travel restrictions. Dr. Osborne
says she holds out hope for a bill introduced by Rep. Roy
Rowland (D., Ga.) removing AIDS from the list of diseases
barring entry to the U.S.
   "I understand the frustration," she says. "Science doesn't
just mean those people with research grants. Progress demands
a blending of traditional voices, with those of people with
with HIV disease."
   However, Dr. Osborne declares it is "incongruous to attack
a scientific meeting" over a policy set by bureaucrats. "It's
awful to see the anguish of {conference organizers} that
their meeting could be desecrated."

   NEW YORK -- General Host Corp. gave an optimistic outlook
for its 272 Frank's Nursery &amp; Crafts stores but said it
expects a $2.7 million charge for the fiscal first quarter on
an equity investment.
   Speaking to analysts here, Harris J. Ashton, chairman and
chief executive officer, said the charge will be offset as
the company eliminates certain income-tax reserves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The charge and reserve reversal, $35 million of
senior-debt payments, and repurchase of $5 million of
mortgage notes at a discount will clean up the balance sheet
and add two cents a share to profit for the quarter ending
May 20, the executive said.
   Mr. Ashton declined to estimate earnings, though operating
results for the first quarter, General Host's strongest
because it covers the spring planting season, should be
"pretty excellent."
   The quarter's sales to date are up 6.6%, and 4.3% on a
same-store basis, from the year-earlier period, he said. A
year ago, first-period net income was $1.5 million, or eight
cents a share, on total sales of $158.6 million.
   The Stamford, Conn., company has cut its advertising costs
$4 million in the first quarter, while sales have risen, Mr.
Ashton said. By running ads as part of newspapers' text
rather than in expensive separate inserts, General Host hopes
to cut fiscal 1991 ad costs to 5% of sales vs. 6.9% a year
earlier, said a spokesman.
   Capital spending will range from $10 million to $15
million this fiscal year, General Host said, as the company
opens as many as 10 new stores and installs laser-scanning
registers at all stores.
   Mr. Ashton said that in fiscal 1990, the company
substantially completed payments of damages arising from a
1977 lawsuit charging a former General Host subsidiary,
American Salt Co., with polluting ground water on farm land.
General Host sold the salt manufacturer in 1977.

   Can Anything Stop Los Angeles?

   As Southern California has grown rapidly over the past
decade, so has the so-called "slow-growth" movement. A decade
ago, virtually no one in the Southern California megalopolis
lived under growth restrictions. Now most people in the
region accept them as a way of life.
   Although the slow-growth movement can win elections, it
does not seem able actually to slow growth. The best evidence
from Southern California is that even within a single
geographic region, anti-development activism shuffles growth
from one place to another not far away. When new houses are
restricted in one area of metropolitan Los Angeles, they
simply pop up somewhere else nearby, usually on inexpensive
virgin land, a little more distant from the urban core. Then,
the political pressure to stop development grows in these
newer communities. So the developers move out a little
farther again.

   Nowhere has this occured more dramatically than in the
areas ringing the San Fernando Valley, northwest of downtown
Los Angeles. Once the ultimate suburb, the San Fernando
Valley, like many postwar suburbs, has emerged as a
commercial employment center. It is now spawning suburbs of
its own, farther and farther away -- in the Conejo, Santa
Clarita and Antelope valleys.
   One of them is Thousand Oaks, located in the Conejo valley
just a few miles to the west. It looks like a suburbanite's
dream; low and broad, with no tall buildings and a
stateliness rare for an auto-oriented community. Even the
parking lots are handsome. Median household income exceeds
$60,000. A third of the city's 52 square miles are set aside
for parks and open space.
   For a decade, Thousand Oaks has tried to maintain its
suburban tranquility by restricting residential construction
to 500 units per year. (Subsidized housing is exempt.) When
city officials talk about their growth-control ordinance,
though, they rarely speak about the actual benefits of having
fewer houses constructed. Rather, they talk about the
leverage it gives the city in the planning process. Each
development proposal is rated according to aesthetics and
impact on public services. The projects with the highest
rating receive some of the city's 500 housing "allocations"
each year.
   The growth-control ordinance has enabled Thousand Oaks to
obtain parks and trails, save precious oak trees and acquire
other community benefits. But the point system encourages
developers to build larger and more expensive homes in order
to pay for all the amenities. Median home price in Thousand
Oaks is now $325,000.
   The growth-control law kept Thousand Oaks affluent and
attractive throughout the 1980s. No one can argue seriously,
however, that it has changed the basic growth dynamics in the
Conejo Valley. Despite high land prices, home buyers and
businesses continue to stream west out of the San Fernando in
huge numbers. The Southern California Association of
Governments predicts that over the next 20 years, the Conejo
Valley will witness a doubling of both population and jobs.
   Twenty-five miles northeast of Thousand Oaks, across the
San Gabriel Mountains from the San Fernando Valley and the
Los Angeles border, lie several communities that banded
together two years ago to become the city of Santa Clarita.
Virtually unknown a decade ago, Santa Clarita has more than
150,000 residents today and could have as many as 270,000 by
the year 2010. The area has been invaded by middle-class home
buyers fleeing the increasingly expensive and crowded San
Fernando Valley to the south. An estimated 40% of its
residents commute south along the Golden State Freeway into
the Valley each day. Despite a boom in home building, Santa
Clarita home prices are skyrocketing -- from an average of
$160,000 when the city was incorporated two years ago to
$230,000 today.
   Local streets are choked with traffic much of the time.
Many areas suffer from water runoff problems, inadequate
sewer systems and a lack of parks. Voters here approved
incorporation two years ago in hopes of gaining more control
over growth in the Santa Clarita Valley. But many of the
political tools they need to limit growth still belong to the
Los Angeles County government, 35 miles south in downtown
L.A.
   The county board of supervisors is controlled by
free-enterprise advocates who prefer not to intervene in
private development. Before cityhood arrived in 1987, the
county controlled all development in the valley; even today,
most land in the valley remains under the county's rule.
   Unable to persuade the developers or the L.A. County
government to pay for the cost of rapid growth, the residents
of Santa Clarita have made it clear they do not plan to tax
themselves either. Two years ago, to win voter support for a
school construction tax, local school districts decided to
impose the tax only on future residents. And last November, a
proposed property tax increase to improve roads got only 20%
of the vote.
   While Santa Clarita revolts against paying the costs of
congestion, however, developers are planning to bring in
more. The county is considering 45 proposals to build 38,000
more houses in the hilly, unincorporated territory outside
the Santa Clarita city limits.
   Last year, Santa Clarita sought an expansion of its
"sphere of influence" -- an area over which it has some but
not all control -- from the 40-square-mile city limits to a
200-square-mile area. The county turned the request down last
November.
   From Santa Clarita, it is a 40-mile drive up Highway 14 to
a place that home builders and home buyers now consider the
promised land: the Antelope Valley. At more than 2,000 feet
above sea level, this is the high desert -- virtually endless
plateau where the weather is sizzling in the summer, freezing
in the winter and windy all the time.
   With growth restrictions limiting their activities
elsewhere, L.A. home builders arrived here in the early '80s,
attracted by the cheap land. They threw up huge subdivisions
around the country towns of Lancaster and Palmdale, and
started selling houses for under $100,000, mostly to young
families tied to jobs in the San Fernando Valley. These new
residents drive 50, 60, even 70 miles each way to work. The
Antelope Valley is expected to grow from around 150,000 today
to more than a half-million people over the next 20 years.
   Local political leaders have generally welcomed the
influx. The commuters, as well as the construction industry,
have given the Antelope Valley an economic stability the area
rarely enjoyed in the past, when it was highly dependent on
the aerospace industry. There are some hints of coming
conflict. At meetings of the Lancaster Planning Commission,
the big-name developers who come to plead for zoning changes
are sometimes joined by longtime residents who complain that
the developers are crowding too many homes on small lots. In
fact, lot size is such a sensitive issue that one commission
member lost his seat for daring to tell residents of one
neighborhood that their rural lifestyle is a thing of the
past.
   Antelope Valley residents fear nothing more than becoming
"another San Fernando Valley," but, in fact, the area's power
structure is pushing quite deliberately toward the future
that the San Fernando Valley represents. Local business and
political leaders have tried very hard to push the Antelope
Valley past the bedroom stage and make it into a center for
employment, just as the San Fernando Valley is. The two
cities have undertaken a joint commercial marketing effort
that includes advertisements in this newspaper. Already, one
large company, Anderson-Barrows Metals Corp., has been lured
out of a business park in Santa Clarita.
   It took the San Fernando Valley four decades to evolve
from a semi-rural suburb to a crowded and economically
powerful urban center. The Antelope Valley is rolling through
the same cycle in only a few years. This fact is reflected
most dramatically in home prices. The average home price has
risen from $80,000 in 1984 to somewhere between $130,000 and
$150,000 today. As the Antelope valley economic development
effort takes off, the area could take on all the unwelcome
characteristics that the locals associate with the San
Fernando Valley.
   Just north of Lancaster along Highway 14 lies what has
constituted, up to now, the northern terminus of the L.A.
metropolitan area: the Kern County line. Across the line lie
communities such as Rosamond and Mojave -- tiny, poor desert
towns that originally existed because of the railroads and
have barely survived for decades. Political control lies in
the county seat of Bakersfield, 60 miles northwest.
   Some of L.A.'s biggest home builders have been banking
land in Rosamond, and have their eyes on Mojave as well. Last
November, the Kern County board of supervisors approved a new
comprehensive plan for Rosamond, whose current population is
around 11,000, that will permit a population of 80,000 by the
year 2000. And just a few miles northwest of Mojave, in the
mountain town of Tehachapi, real estate developers who
control thousands of acres are talking about building "new
towns" with thousands of jobs and tens of thousands of
people.
   The outward push of metropolitan Los Angeles, which began
40 years ago when suburban development hit the San Fernando
Valley, may soon reach communities close to a hundred miles
away. And while those communities may welcome the economic
bonanza at first, soon they too may be faced with the
question of how to accommodate growth while maintaining the
rural way of life that the new residents left places like
Santa Clarita and Lancaster to pursue. And so they will
probably engage in micro-solutions that don't do much to
solve a very macro problem.
