   Mark Morris Back in U.S., Triumphantly

   Boston -- Mark Morris may have been director of dance at
the Theatre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels since 1988, but
he remains very much part of the U.S. dance scene. One reason
is that for the past two years Boston's Dance Umbrella has
had the wit to invite him and his company, officially called
Monnaie Dance Group/Mark Morris, to show the American public
what they have been up to in Belgium.
   In 1989, Dance Umbrella gave the American premiere of Mr.
Morris's choreographed version of Purcell's opera "Dido and
Aeneas," a daring and revelatory evening-length production
finally brought back to these shores last month by the
Brooklyn Academy of Music. In June of this year, Dance
Umbrella presented the Brussels company in a mixed bill that
included both sets of Brahms's "Love Song Waltzes"; a solo
danced by the choreographer, "Ten Suggestions"; and the
American premiere of a major work, "Behemoth." With this rich
and brilliant program, Mr. Morris reaffirmed his standing, at
the age of 33, as the leading dance creator of his
generation.

   It is important to stress that Mr. Morris's talents
encompass dance in a comprehensive sense, and not simply of
the post-modernist variety. In "Drink to Me Only With Thine
Eyes," which in 1988 gave American Ballet Theatre its most
stimulating new work since Twyla Tharp's "The Little Ballet,"
he showed a thoroughgoing mastery of classical ballet
technique. Not only did he modulate easily from wit to
eloquence, he also showed enough confidence in the form to
enrich its resources without falsifying its nature.
   It is, however, not in the U.S., at ABT, but on the other
side of the Atlantic, at the Monnaie, that he has been given
the opportunities he needed to extend his creative reach.
(Since the departure of artistic director Mikhail
Baryshnikov, ABT has apparently shown no sign of interest in
the choreographer.) Not only did the Brussels company supply
him with the complex musical resources, both choral and
orchestral, necessary for full-length projects such as "Dido"
and Handel's "L'Allegro, Il Penseroso ed il Moderato," it has
also enabled him to create a series of diverse and
fascinating works in many styles and moods. During the past
year, these have ranged from the sinister "Wonderland" --
performed to Schoenberg's "Five Pieces for Orchestra" by
guest artists Mikhail Baryshnikov and Rob Besserer -- to the
joyous "Love Song Waltzes" and "New Love Song Waltzes" of
Brahms.
   Music is a crucial feature of Mr. Morris's work, not
simply because, in Balanchine's phrase, it provides a floor
for the dancers to walk on, but because for the expatriate
choreographer it is the essential source of new discoveries
about space, time, movement, mood, meaning. His musical
sympathies are astonishingly wide. A devotee of the baroque,
and particularly Bach, Mr. Morris has also used the work of
composers as disparate as Virgil Thomson, Giuseppe Verdi and
Lou Harrison, not to mention groups like The Violent Femmes
and Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys.
   Mr. Morris uses music in various ways, sometimes as a
visual realization of the music's spirit and style, and
sometimes as a deliberate contrast to them. In both sets of
"Love Song Waltzes," he translates Brahms's passionate
lyricism into images of emotional susceptibility and
fulfillment. In "Ten Suggestions," on the other hand, he uses
Alexander Tcherepnin's charming "Ten Bagatelles" for a series
of capers mocking pretension and solemnity.
   That Mr. Morris should have now created a work,
"Behemoth," danced to silence is hardly as surprising as some
have found it. As one quickly sees, the absence of music is
not the gimmick it is in, say, Jerome Robbins's sentimental
"Moves," but the inevitable response to a special set of
needs. Mr. Morris said in a recent interview that he had
dispensed with music because he couldn't find anything
suitable for his expressive purposes.
   These are grim. "Behemoth" is about collective terror,
anxiety, heartlessness. A further investigation into the
nameless fears projected in last season's "Wonderland," it is
also the obverse of "Love Song Waltzes" and, especially, "New
Love Song Waltzes." In those works, love irradiates the
smallest as well as the most expansive of gestures. In
"Behemoth," feeling is submerged in apprehension and
uncertainty. Left for the most part in gloom, the dancers
wear tiny reflective shards, faintly flickering tokens of
their almost extinguished humanity.
   In this world, empathy is banished, and survival has
become the highest goal. Seen only as members of a group, the
dancers re-enact the plight of the prisoners in "Fidelio,"
though in existential rather than political terms. Their only
hope is located, not in themselves, not in their fellow
victims, but in some impersonal force beyond the deadening
circumstances of their confinement. As the lights brighten,
the performers raise their hands above their heads in a
gesture of yearning that betokens placation as much as
spiritual dependence. In this state of physical constraint
and emotional desolation, individuals are distinguished only
to emphasize their desperate plight.
   Played against the back wall of an undecorated stage,
"Behemoth" offers none of the comforts of theatrical
make-believe. Music, which usually organizes as well as
flavors Mr. Morris's works, here gives way to blankness.
"Behemoth" is not itself a statement of despair, however, but
a picture of despair. Its division into 10 brief segments
implies structure, the existence of providence. The absence
of music, moreover, does not produce silence, but lets us
hear the affecting sound of dancers breathing, jumping,
shuffling and at one point painfully dragging themselves
across the stage.
   Americans can next see the Morris company at the Brooklyn
Academy of Music in October, the latter probably with Mr.
Baryshnikov.

   NATO Agrees to Alter Defense Strategy
   In Aftermath of Communism's Collapse

   LONDON -- The Western allies agreed in principle on steps
to revamp their defense strategy in light of the collapse of
communism in Eastern Europe, as well as on a dramatic
symbolic gesture to show that they want to cooperate with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   In the first day of a two-day summit meeting of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, the alliance generally accepted
a proposal by President Bush to declare that NATO will use
nuclear weapons only as a "last resort," U.S. officials said.
Britain and France voiced some misgivings about a change,
however, and language designed to address their concerns was
being drafted late last night.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The allies also agreed to an American proposal to invite
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to address a NATO meeting,
officials said. The invitation is intended as a way of
illustrating that the alliance wants to enter a new era of
cooperation with its longtime adversaries in the Eastern
bloc. France initially questioned whether to invite Mr.
Gorbachev personally at this time, when he is working out
serious domestic political problems, but later accepted the
idea.
   In addition, the U.S. and West Germany appeared to have
worked out an agreement on the sensitive question of whether
to make a commitment now on how much to cut the size of the
army of a newly united Germany.
   Officials said the two sides worked out a compromise in
which a general pledge to cut the army will be included as an
appendage to a conventional arms treaty now being negotiated
with the Soviet Union in Vienna, while leaving details and
haggling over the precise size of the cut for a later,
follow-on conventional arms pact.
   The Soviet Union has sought a pledge of cuts in the German
army, and Bonn wanted to satisfy Moscow. But the U.S. feared
that trying to set a specific size for the new German army
now would unduly complicate completion of the almost
completed conventional arms pact.
   Final details of the agreements were being worked out late
last night by NATO foreign ministers, who had failed to
resolve all the snags in four hours of intense private talks
earlier in the day. More than anything else, the changes are
designed to illustrate to the Soviet Union that it has
nothing to fear from allowing a newly united Germany to
become a full member of the revamped NATO alliance.
   The foreign ministers are expected to resolve their
differences in time for the alliance to issue a communique
today containing outlines of a new NATO strategy and kicking
off a more detailed overhaul of alliance policies.
   As if to underscore the sensitivity of the NATO session,
Mr. Gorbachev sent the British government a letter on the eve
of the summit saying he would be watching the meeting closely
as he weighs his decisions on Germany. He also referred to
his country's need for Western aid, European officials said.
   Mr. Bush is trying to engineer changes in alliance policy
that go far enough to show that NATO is adjusting to
political realities, but not so far that they emasculate the
alliance, the most important vehicle for wielding U.S.
influence in Europe. To some extent, Mr. Bush has found
himself caught in the middle of the alliance, between allies
such as Germany, who want to move quickly in making changes,
and France and Britain, who have argued for more caution.
   The argument for caution was summarized by British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, who declared at the summit's
opening session: "The cornerstones of {NATO's} sure defense
must remain, for we do not know what the future holds, but
the architecture may change in the new situation."
   In addition to the other changes, Mr. Bush suggested that
NATO establish some kind of undefined "liaison" relationship
with nations of the Warsaw Pact. That step, combined with the
invitation to Mr. Gorbachev to visit NATO, would be designed
to "show that NATO has a new dimension of cooperation with
the Soviet Union and the new democracies of Eastern Europe,"
Mr. Bush told allied leaders. Some allies questioned how such
a liaison link would work, and details were being debated.
   Mr. Bush also declared that the U.S. is prepared to
withdraw its nuclear-tipped artillery shells from West
Germany. Making that offer amounted to making a virtue out of
necessity. The short-range shells have lost their military
usefulness now that East Germany and other countries
bordering the Western alliance have dumped their communist
systems and broken out of the Soviet orbit.
   But it remains unclear whether the U.S. and West Germany
have agreed on how quickly to pull out the artillery shells.
   Mr. Bush is proposing completing the pullout only after
the pending conventional arms-reduction pact with the Soviets
is completed and "Soviet-stationed forces in Europe have
returned home," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   West Germany would like to set a faster timetable. West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told the summit that his
government hopes that all the artillery shells will be
eliminated as soon as the conventional agreement is signed
and the Soviets make some undefined gesture of "reciprocity."
   On the sensitive question of NATO's nuclear strategy, Mr.
Bush didn't propose ditching the alliance's policy of
"flexible response," which reserves the right to respond to
an overwhelming conventional attack by quickly turning to
short-range nuclear arms. Rather, Mr. Bush wants to refine
the policy by declaring that nuclear arms would be a "last
resort."
   British and French officials, though concerned that such a
change could raise questions about the entire future of
nuclear arms in Europe, expressed willingness to live with
that language provided it is coupled with a declaration that
NATO will continue to have a nuclear deterrent.

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West German production of raw
steel in the first half fell 6.7% to 19.38 million metric
tons, compared with a year earlier, the Federal Statistics
Office said. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
   First-half output of raw iron declined 8.2% to 15.28
million metric tons.

   In June, the country produced slightly more than three
million metric tons of raw steel, down 12% from a year
earlier, and smelters made 9.8% less raw iron at 2.4 million
tons.
   Steel and iron production in West Germany has been soft
this year, in part because end users in some sectors
stockpiled supplies last year.

   BUENOS AIRES -- There is at least one benefit to
Argentina's dramatic economic decline: The deterioration has
reached such an extreme level that all social sectors seem to
have come together to demand an immediate resolution,
focusing on privatization of an obsolete, statist economy.
While resistance to privatization efforts continues,
opposition groups retreat a bit more every day as they are
forced to come up with productive responses when faced with
an increasing public awareness of the urgent solutions
required.
   Much attention recently has focused on the privatization
of Argentina's byzantine state-owned telephone company. But
the privatization of the oil and gas sector -- lorded over by
the state oil monopoly YPF -- may be a better indicator of
the forces for change in Argentina as well as the resistance
that still has to be overcome.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With other entities, privatization usually means little
more than the transfer of public assets to private hands. But
privatization in the oil and gas sector also can imply
substantial new investments that lead to expansion and
economic growth. For such projects there is an abundance of
international expertise available as well as substantial
investor interest, if the right conditions pertain. Hence
their significance as they clear the channels for an
investment flow that also can benefit other sectors of
Argentina's economy.
   Argentina is not a major oil producer, but it is blessed
with abundant reservoirs of both oil and gas, commercially
quite viable at current world price levels. Yet major areas
of its territory remain largely unexplored. The only way to
break the current cycle of stagnation in Argentina's
oil-and-gas-producing sector lies in the opening of those
resources to private capital investment, be it of national or
multinational origin. Therein lies the financial strength and
operational capability with which to develop those fields.
   This proposal is certainly not original. What is new is
the almost universal support it has garnered from public
opinion generally in Argentina.
   Thirty years ago, the Movement of Integration and
Development political party first suggested transforming half
a century of state monopoly of all oil and gas activity;
multinational oil companies were invited to share in the
production process. Such a break with nationalist tradition
brought on one of the nastiest political debates in Argentine
memory. The fiercest critics were the "Radicales" of the
Radical Civic Union (which elected President Raul Alfonsin in
1983) along with certain sectors of the "Peronista" Party to
which Argentina's President Carlos Menem belongs.
   Years went by and in 1984 President Alfonsin traveled to
the U.S to make an announcement -- at the Houston Petroleum
Club -- inviting foreign investors to participate in the
development of Argentina's oil and gas resources. Now
President Menem is embarked on a more ambitious effort to
open areas where the primary producing fields are currently
located to joint-venture participation with the private
sector. These have been YPF's exclusive preserve and will
require a high level of investment to maintain productivity
and develop new fields. These are also the areas that will
provide the quickest return on investment, if properly
managed.
   This project now faces delays and political challenges of
various sorts. These will be unimportant if the president's
determination holds steady, and if there is a clear
understanding that what is at stake is much more than who
will be the operator of this or that field.
   Perhaps the most notorious obstacles to privatizations
(though not the most difficult) are the conditionalities that
the oil workers union seeks to impose on the process. There
are strong and valid reasons behind their lobbying: The
specter of unemployment looms ever larger in Argentina's
recessionary environment.
   Public-opinion polls spell it out clearly. On the one hand
a majority of the population (80%) backs the privatization
drive. On the other, a high percentage wants it to happen
without affecting employment. This might not be a problem if
there were a prosperous economic environment offering
alternative job opportunities. Such not being the case,
privatization efforts demand a return to economic growth if
social upheaval is to be avoided.
   Another hurdle in the way of definitive oil and gas
privatization is the inconsistency between the positions of
various government officials. Territorial squabbles seem to
underlie these differences and undermine a resolute execution
of the project. This is especially so when ambiguities evoke
understandable but undesirable suspicions. There is only one
way to jump over this hurdle: political determination and
resoluteness at the highest level.
   If the overriding objective is that of promoting
investments and productive growth, there will be clear and
acceptable answers to each challenge that may appear. An
example of a critical subject that is part of this discussion
concerns who will be the operator of a field when there is a
joint-venture association with YPF. If greater efficiency is
desired, there is only one viable answer: the private-sector
oil company investor. Any other response would scare away
potential investors and/or defeat the objective of achieving
increased efficiency.
   Another source of opposition to genuine privatization is
the group of companies that has been accustomed to
comfortable positions as ensured suppliers to the state. The
whole area of public-sector purchases and contracts lacks the
agility and the controls that are normal in private-sector
business. Purchasing procedures -- not to mention corruption
-- increase the operating costs of public-sector companies
for the benefit of privileged suppliers, many times acting as
"cartels." Such sinecures are not lost without a fight,
naturally.
   Argentina's provinces have become yet another player in
the YPF privatization process, claiming that they should
receive a larger share of the royalties. This is not the
place to get into the complexities or merits of this debate.
But the underlying cause for such confrontations is the
stagnant economy. A concerted and intense investment drive
would increase oil royalties to a level that could satisfy
provincial governments as well as fulfill the requirements of
the nation as a whole.
   What is substantive in all this is that Argentina is
opening a promising path for oil and gas production to be
driven fundamentally by private investment -- domestic and
foreign. Even though there are obstacles to be overcome,
there is a strong and healthy undercurrent of popular support
for this policy direction. Building on this support, and with
the political determination and executive decisiveness that
alone can achieve worthwhile goals, success well may be at
hand.

   WASHINGTON -- Ernst &amp; Young was barred by an
administrative law judge of the Securities and Exchange
Commission for 45 days from taking any new accounting
business at its New York regional offices for alleged
"improper professional conduct" in audits done by a
predecessor firm.
   The order by administrative law judge Jerome K. Soffer was
effective June 28, its issue date. The SEC's accounting
division previously alleged that work done by Ernst &amp; Whinney
for U.S. Surgical Corp. in 1980 and 1981 resulted in
unqualified audit reports on statements that significantly
overstated U.S. Surgical's income. Ernst &amp; Whinney merged
last year with Arthur Young &amp; Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, the administrative order censured Michael L.
Ferrante, managing partner of Ernst &amp; Young's office in White
Plains, N.Y., who was the firm's partner supervising the
audits of U.S. Surgical, a Norwalk, Conn.-based maker of
surgical stapling devices. The order doesn't affect the
firm's work begun prior to June 28.
   An Ernst &amp; Young spokesman in New York said, "This is a
very old matter in which civil litigation was concluded many
years ago without any payment from the firm. We feel that
after almost 10 years, it is time to put the matter behind
us." He said the bar was only for new clients that are
subject to SEC reporting requirements and only affected audit
work. Calls to Mr. Ferrante at the White Plains office were
referred back to Ernst &amp; Young's main office.
   One expert on the accounting profession said he saw little
if any practical harm to Ernst &amp; Young. "Clients or potential
clients will only wait" until the 45 days runs out, said Jim
Emerson, editor of the Professional Services Report in
Seattle, which monitors the accounting profession. "The only
injury is going to be negative visibility, which is not
helpful in light of other things, like the S&amp;L crisis. The
climate right now is very touchy" with accounting firms, he
said.

   DETROIT -- Chrysler Corp. said it is temporarily halting
production at four of its assembly plants to prepare for
model changeovers.
   The nation's No. 3 auto maker said it is idling for two
weeks its production facilities in Belvidere, Ill., Newark,
N.J., Sterling Heights, Mich., and St. Louis. The plants
build the New Yorker, Imperial, LeBaron, Plymouth Acclaim,
Plymouth Sundance, Dodge Spirit, Dodge Shadow and Dodge
Daytona. About 10,050 hourly workers will be temporarily
idled by the moves, which take effect Monday.
</LP>

   Chrysler said its assembly plant in Belvidere will be
closed an additional week because of slow sales. That plant
will resume production July 30.
   General Motors Corp. said it will close its assembly
plants in Van Nuys, Calif., for two weeks beginning Monday,
because of slow sales of the Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac
Firebirds built there. The auto maker also said it will halt
assembly for the two weeks at its Willow Run, Mich., plant to
prepare for production of fleet and special-use vehicles,
such as taxicabs and police cars. The plant builds the
Chevrolet Corsica.
   As previously reported, Ford Motor Co.'s assembly plants
will be idle next week, for the auto maker's traditional
summer break.
   Overall, the 10 major auto makers in the U.S. planned to
build 70,022 units this week, a 71% increase over 40,925
built a year ago.

   European Air Traffic Controllers Stage
   Walkouts in Renewal of Summer Ritual

   BRUSSELS -- For those Europeans who can't tell from the
weather that summer is here, there is another clue:
air-traffic controller strikes.
   French controllers in the air-traffic center that handles
the Paris region ended a three-day walkout. Air France had to
cancel 60% of its short-range and medium-range flights, and
domestic carrier Air Inter canceled two out of three of its
scheduled flights. Foreign airlines flying to Paris also
trimmed or canceled their schedules. Yesterday, Air France's
ground personnel announced a 36-hour strike beginning today.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last week, Belgian controllers halted all airline
operations at Brussels Airport for a day until they won a 24%
pay increase over two years. Rome controllers threatened a
work stoppage before the World Cup soccer match began in
June, but then backed off after a plea from the transport
minister. Swedish controllers staged work-to-rule actions in
May, causing chaotic delays at Stockholm airport and
throughout the country.
   No one, not even the International Federation of Air
Traffic Controllers Associations, knows where the next
European strike will occur. "I don't think any air-traffic
control organization plans on having an industrial dispute,"
says Preben Falkman-Lauridsen, a Danish controller who is
IFATCA's executive vice president for Europe. "But when
negotiations with the administration go poorly, that's when
there's a strike."
   Strikes cost travelers untold delays and reroutings.
Sabena, Belgian's flag carrier, tried to operate some of its
long-haul flights out of Luxembourg and Duesseldorf during
the one-day strike at Brussels last week. Incoming traffic
was rerouted to Amsterdam and Luxembourg. But that meant
three-hour rail or bus journeys for passengers whose flights
did operate.
   Such actions also cost airlines millions of dollars.
Sabena says it doesn't have a price tag yet for last week's
action. But the annual reports of many European airlines
contain evidence of the costliness of a controllers' strike,
or indeed, any action by pilots, mechanics, flight attendants
or others that slows or halts flight operations -- even in
another country.
   Unfortunately, such industrial actions appear endemic in
Europe. Certainly, those on the receiving end seem to be
resigned. "It's the usual summer obstructions," one airport
official says of the recent disturbances.
   "It's the normal amount," says a spokesman for
Eurocontrol, a Pan-European air-traffic planning agency.
"It's not that bad compared with last year."
   Adds Marcel Pisters, deputy secretary-general of the
Association of European Airlines: "These are sporadic things.
It's a reflection of the overall air-traffic control setup in
Europe." Controllers, he adds, "are civil servants. And in a
number of countries, their financial conditions aren't the
best you can think of."
   The French stoppage affected the country's main northern
air-traffic center at Athis-Mons. Controllers are asking pay
and staff increases to cope with what they say is a mounting
workload caused by the boom in air travel. Strikers are
demanding bonuses of 3,000 French francs ($540) to FFr5,000 a
month to supplement their current average monthly salary of
FFr16,000.
   But the complaints aren't always about money. "These
disputes seem to flare up very quickly," says a spokesman for
the International Transport Workers Federation, over issues
such as manning levels, shifts, overtime work, reduced
holiday periods and poor equipment. And their grievances "are
pretty well justified," says one labor specialist.
   The roots of the problem can be traced back to the early
1980s. Then, Europe plunged into recession, air-traffic fell
and governments quit recruiting controllers and took money
earmarked for air-traffic equipment and put it into roads,
hospitals, schools and other worthy state projects.
   So when economies improved and air travel unexpectedly
boomed in the mid-1980s, governments were doubly
ill-prepared. By some estimates, Europe needs 1,500 to 2,000
more qualified controllers than it has today, mostly due to
double-digit traffic increases in the past few years. But
with the moderate-to-low salaries offered, it isn't easy to
recruit controllers. And it takes several years to train
them.
   Meanwhile, experts say, Europe's air-traffic system is
hopelessly inefficient. Western Europe has 22 national
systems running 42 air-traffic control centers. The centers
handle half the traffic 20 U.S. centers handle -- for twice
the price. Little effort is being made to standardize
purchasing of equipment, and the necessary technical upgrades
are slow in coming.
   This problem has gotten more attention in the past couple
of years of massive summertime air congestion and frequent
air-traffic control strikes. Governments are beginning to
budget more money for the field and are for the first time
talking to their neighbors about integrating their control
systems. But billions of dollars, lots of political will and
years are called for, especially as air traffic continues to
surge.
   Thus, the short-term outlook isn't bright. "You can make
controllers work a lot of overtime and lengthen their working
hours," says Mr. Falkman-Lauridsen of IFATCA, "or they can
handle reduced traffic." In other words, the choice is
between strikes and delays.

   With Swiss Secrecy Law Under Attack,
   Private Bankers Seek Wider Client Base

   GENEVA -- Times are changing for the tradition-steeped
world of this city's private bankers.
   With Switzerland's legendary banking secrecy law under
attack, Geneva's elite money men are increasingly stressing
performance and professionalism as they seek to diversify
their client base and take business from the major global
players in the institutional fund management business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, the bankers are faced with more
demanding private "high net-worth" clients and competition
from other tight-lipped banking centers such as Luxembourg
and Austria, and even upstarts like Hungary and Sri Lanka.
   The Swiss government's lifting in the past two years of
banking secrecy while investigating funds allegedly belonging
to deposed dictators Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines,
Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, and Jean-Claude Duvalier of
Haiti, has led outsiders to question just how air-tight a
Swiss bank account is.
   Now, the private bankers increasingly recognize that the
days of easily winning new clients are over. "We don't think
as far as our long-term strategy goes, Swiss banking secrecy
will and should play a major role in attracting clients,"
says Thierry Lombard, a managing partner at Lombard Odier &amp;
Cie., which began to take deposits 192 years ago.
   The Geneva houses deny that the highly publicized
investigations have any negative implications for their
average customer, but they do know they must broaden their
client base to continue to thrive.
   "The typical, honest client who has a little reserve in
Switzerland does not have anything to fear for the time
being," says Benedict Hentsch, managing partner of Hentsch &amp;
Cie., Geneva's oldest private bank, founded in 1796.
"Nevertheless, I would think we should work under the
assumption that the pressure will be mounting against banking
secrecy and that we have to become even better managers to
compensate for the disappearance of it."
   Lombard Odier &amp; Cie., and Hentsch &amp; Cie. are two of the
six banks that make up the Groupement des Banquiers prives
genevois. The Geneva houses differ from most other Swiss
financial institutions in that they don't make loans and
their partners carry the unlimited liability for any deposits
at the bank. They have until recently engaged mainly in
protecting the funds of wealthy foreigners.
   Whether the private banks can successfully diversify into
the high profile world of institutional investment is far
from certain. Unlike some of their giant competitors in the
U.S., the U.K. and some of the Swiss commercial banks, most
Geneva private bankers prefer the soft sell.
   Even at home, hand-sized brass plaques with a few initials
are all that identify a private banks' headquarters. They
leave the more aggressive foreign houses to dominate Geneva's
sprawling lake front with their flashy modern buildings and
giant corporate logos.
   Still, most members of the Groupement des Banquiers prives
genevois say business has been excellent, but since they're
closely held, no financial data are made public. Outside
analysts estimate that the six banks have some 85 billion
Swiss francs ($60 billion) under management, about double the
total 10 years ago despite significant capital repatriation
from clients in France and Italy as the economic and taxation
climate in those countries improved.
   Lombard Odier &amp; Cie., Hentsch &amp; Cie., and Pictet &amp; Cie. in
particular have been steadily expanding in the past decade,
largely to win institutional clients.
   Pictet has set up shop in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Montreal and
last month in Luxembourg. Lombard Odier has opened offices in
the Netherlands and Canada, expanded in the U.K, and become
the first European bank to obtain a seat on the New York
Stock Exchange. Hentsch has bought or taken important stakes
in banks in Tokyo, Milan and Nassau.
   And nearly all the members of Geneva's Groupement have
started up or expanded offices in Zurich, mainly to be in the
running for Switzerland's potentially lucrative pension fund
business. A recent study sponsored by Salomon Brothers
estimated that Swiss pension fund assets totalled 225 billion
francs in 1989, and should rise to 360 billion francs by 1995
as pooled investments become more common.
   Not all banks are going for institutional clients, though.
For example, Bordier &amp; Cie., one of the smallest in the
Groupement, plans to keep its focus on serving rich
individuals rather than starting up the expensive marketing,
research and reporting departments needed to win
institutional accounts.

   NEW YORK -- The National Association of Securities Dealers
expelled two firms and sanctioned several firms and
individuals for alleged rule violations.
   D'Martine Financial Services Inc. and principal Peter J.
Rumsavich, both of Rolling Meadows, Ill., were fined a total
of $50,000. The firm was expelled, and Mr. Rumsavich was
barred from membership. Among other charges, NASD said, the
firm failed to maintain required net capital, and it
deposited funds from subscribers to a limited partnership
offering in an account Mr. Rumsavich controlled rather than
in an escrow or trust account.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   D'Martine's Mr. Rumsavich said: "We've been trying to
withdraw from the NASD for 2 1/2 years. We've been going
through an audit. Our total commissions for the past three
years have been $2,000 a year. Isn't it just like the NASD to
tag us with a $50,000 fine and know that we will not pursue
the matter any further to save a $2,000 commission base?"
   Baldwin Capital Partners was expelled, and principal
George Horace Baldwin was fined $5,000, suspended as a
principal for two years and required to requalify for the
position. The firm and Mr. Baldwin, both of Tiburon, Calif.,
didn't respond to NASD requests for information, the
self-regulatory agency for the over-the-counter market said.
   U.S. Advisors Inc. of Novato, Calif., and an associate,
Paul M. Misch of Chicago, were fined a total of $35,000, and
Mr. Misch was barred. They failed to file certain reports and
failed to respond to requests for information, the NASD
charged.
   American Wallstreet Securities Inc., Tampa, Fla., and two
Brandon, Fla., principals, Eric J. Walloga and Kevin D. Ward,
were fined a total of $14,000. The firm and executives didn't
admit or deny any wrongdoing in connection with NASD charges
that the firm charged excessive markups on securities of 20%
to 88% above market levels.
   Meridian Associates Inc. and principal Jack R. Wolff, both
of Sarasota, Fla., were fined a total of $10,000, and Mr.
Wolff was suspended for three business days. Without
admitting or denying wrongdoing, they consented to findings
that the firm operated three offices with 34 representatives
when an accord with the NASD limited the firm to one office
and six representatives.
   Mr. Wolff, Meridian's founder and president, said: "The
action taken is a reflection of both our growth and an
apparent oversight on our part in the 1987-1988 time frame to
advise the NASD in advance of our expansion. . . . Meridian
is a member in good standing with the NASD and is continuing
its growth in accordance with the company's business plan."

   Except as noted, the firms and individuals involved in the
NASD disciplinary actions couldn't be reached for comment.
   Mr. Cruchon said the NASD's allegations are "not true,"
adding: "They can do what they want to. I didn't have the
money to fight it, or it wouldn't have been done. I was a
scapegoat. They let off {Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.}
and some other people, and there was one left. I just feel
like a scapegoat."
   Messrs. Gentry, Nahmias, Rosa and Shaw declined to
comment.

   Jump Into Race

   TOKYO -- A major trading company and a leading supermarket
chain have jointly launched Japan's latest entrant in the
race to produce films and television programming.
   C. Itoh &amp; Co., one of Japan's largest trading houses, and
Seiyu Ltd., a member of the Saison retailing and hotel group,
announced the establishment of Media International Corp.
Takao Yoshiki, president of the new venture, said the
Tokyo-based concern intends to co-produce television
programming with foreign companies, to invest in film
productions, to supply news from Japan and other Asian
nations to foreign broadcasters, and to buy and sell
audio-visual software.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With Japan's fledgling cable-television and
direct-satellite broadcasting networks expected to
proliferate in the next few years, there is widespread talk
here of an impending shortage of "software," or television
programs. So a variety of companies are hoping to fill the
void.
   American cable networks such as Turner Broadcasting System
Co.'s Cable News Network and ESPN Inc. are supplying
programming to the nascent market. Moreover, a number of
Japanese companies have moved into the film-production
business, with Sony Corp.'s $3.4 billion purchase of Columbia
Pictures Entertainment Inc. the most prominent example.
   Media International said that its aim is to help supply
"high quality software" internationally by acting as a
"software comprehensive trading company."
   Exactly what that means won't be clear for at least a few
months. Initially, Media International will be merely a
pre-operational planning organization with capital of 550
million yen, or about $3.7 million. C. Itoh and Seiyu each is
supplying 45.5% of that total, with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and
Sumitomo Bank, two of the world's biggest banks, each
providing 4.5%. Actual operations are expected to begin in
November.
   Mr. Yoshiki, previously vice president of NHK Enterprises,
a subsidiary of Japan's public broadcasting network, said in
an interview that Media International expects to increase its
capital to about $30 million and hopes to achieve revenue of
about $200 million in its first year. The new company said it
plans eventually to draw in about 40 corporate participants
from a cross-section of Japanese industry.
   While a mammoth trading company and a supermarket chain
would seem unlikely candidates for the entertainment
business, both C. Itoh and Seiyu already have footholds in
the industry. Seiyu has produced several film adaptations of
Japanese literary works, and C. Itoh, one of several trading
companies pursuing this new line of business, recently joined
with ESPN to launch a cable television sports network in
Japan.
   While NHK Enterprises developed the idea for Media
International, NHK won't have a direct equity participation
in the new company, Mr. Yoshiki said. NHK will, however,
stand to benefit by procuring programming for its two
direct-broadcast satellite stations and for its traditional
television and radio networks.

   At Commercial Textiles, Siblings Strive
   To Rescue Dream of the Father

   HOMESTEAD, Pa. -- Not every young manager would give up a
career at Twentieth Century Fox and an apartment on a
California beach to help run his father's troubled business
in this onetime flourishing steel community.
   But that's what David Frischman, a marketing manager, did
when his father died of cancer four years ago. He joined his
brother, Les, then a Los Angeles executive recruiter, and his
sister, Cindy Frischman-Notkin, who had remained here, in a
struggle to save the company. Since then, the siblings have
shown how second-generation entrepreneurs using modern
methods can often succeed where the founder stumbled.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For years, their father, Milton, had worked for his
brother in a linen business. Just 18 months before he died,
Milton invested his life's savings to start Commercial
Textiles Inc., a small business selling uniforms wholesale to
restaurants and hotels.
   When he died of lung cancer, the prospects for the
business seemed so bleak that the family's accountants and
financial advisers urged Mr. Frischman's widow, Rosalyn, and
her children to cut their losses and close the company.
   But the children vowed to keep the business going. "It was
hard giving up Los Angeles, and it was scary coming back, but
my mom and sister couldn't handle the business by
themselves," says 31-year-old Les, company treasurer.
   The family decided that the troubled business had strong
prospects nationwide. To reach customers outside western
Pennsylvania, where their father had concentrated, they
turned to a new marketing strategy.
   They invested $30,000 in a computer system that allows
them to quickly track inventories and customers. Armed with
this system, a toll-free telephone number that attracted
customers from across the country and slick advertising
brochures, the children have increased the business's
clientele to more than 2,000 hotels, restaurants and country
clubs -- from only 50 clients four years ago.
   "The computer gives us information my father would have
never dreamed of," says Les. Adds David, who is company
president: "My father used the old style of bookkeeping,
writing in ledger books and adding by hand. The computer
system makes payables and receivables very easy." It also
helps Commercial Textiles service orders faster than many
similar companies, giving the company an important
competitive edge, the brothers say.
   The first hurdle, however, was scrounging up capital. To
get the business on its feet, the Frischmans took out a
$40,000 loan. After walking from bank to bank and receiving
several "polite no's," they finally got a "yes" from Equimark
Corp.'s Equibank in Pittsburgh.
   To find customers, the Frischmans ordered telephone
directories from major U.S. cities and personally contacted
managers at numerous hotels and restaurants.
   They also found that customers, such as restaurateur Tell
Erhart, responded to care and attention to detail. After one
wholesaler messed up his uniform order, Mr. Erhart went to
Commercial Textiles. "You call them up, give them the sizes
and they ship it out. Usually at big outlets, you're just a
number," says Mr. Erhart, who owns Chef Tell's Grand Old
House on the Caribbean island Grand Cayman.
   The Frischmans use uniform manufacturers in Philadelphia
and Union City, N.J. Unlike some competitors, they will
handle special orders involving embroidery or silk screening.
And at their recently expanded two-floor office on
Homestead's main street, they're shipping about 40 orders a
day, David Frischman says.
   This year, the company expects earnings of about $300,000,
up from $190,000 last year, he says. Sales this year, he
adds, should exceed $1 million -- a marked improvement from
the $20,000 of four years ago.
   Although the business now includes a secretary and a
warehouse supervisor, family members do most everything else.
David Frischman is in charge of advertising, Les Frischman
oversees computer operations and Mrs. Frischman-Notkin
handles marketing. Their mother contacts prospective hotel
and restaurant customers by telephone. And when it comes to
packing, unpacking and stocking the boxes, they all roll up
their sleeves.
   Mrs. Frischman-Notkin recalls that when her father started
the business, there was never enough money for paychecks.
"Every penny we made went back into the business," she says.
   While there are paychecks today, none of the Frischmans
has yet become wealthy. Les Frischman says he is drawing just
$26,000 a year in pay, less than half what he earned in Los
Angeles.
   And of course, the former Californians now overlook
abandoned Homestead steel mills instead of beaches. But they
say they'll keep the company here even if it outgrows its
premises. "Even the name Homestead sounds very quaint," David
Frischman says.

   TAIPEI -- Taiwan's trade surplus during the first half of
1990 totaled $4.94 billion, a 20% decline from the same
period last year, the government announced Thursday.
   But the monthly surplus for June was $1.09 billion, up 23%
from a year ago, said the directorate general of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Exports in the first six months this year totaled $31.87
billion, down 0.8% from the first half of 1989. Imports
totaled $26.93 billion during the first half of 1990, an
increase of 3.9%, the agency said.
   Officials attributed the reduced trade surplus to lower
exports. Higher wages and production costs have weakened
Taiwan's competitiveness in foreign markets.
   Taiwan's surplus with the U.S., its largest trading
partner, totaled $4.04 billion in the first half of 1990,
down 27% from the same period a year earlier.
   Taiwan registered a surplus of $800 million with the U.S.
in June, down 17.1% from June 1989.
   Taiwan's exports to the U.S. totaled $1.72 billion in
June, while imports totaled $920 million.
   Taiwan's trade with Japan, its second largest trading
partner, registered a deficit of $3.71 billion in the first
half this year, rising 15.5% from period a year ago.
   The June deficit with Japan was $710 million in June, up
6.1% from the June 1989.
   The government has projected a 1990 trade surplus of $11
billion, compared with the $13.93 billion surplus last year.

professor had a long list of why the Third World is, with a
few exceptions, a basket case.
   The title is not meant to be facetious, of course, but a
tribute to the 18th-century Scottish economist Adam Smith,
who wrote "An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the
Wealth of Nations" in a Europe that resembles, writes Mr.
Sorman, the Third World today. He cites the "intertwining of
great wealth and great poverty, traditional cultures shaken
by modernization, conflict between despotism and democracy,
intense intellectual ferment." But Mr. Sorman's book also is
a tribute to the hard-working people he met on his travels,
individuals who "reject not only poverty, but the yoke of
monstrous police forces, raving dictatorships, crushing
bureaucracies."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Obviously Mr. Sorman spent a lot of time on the African
continent. He watched farmers scratch listlessly on land they
don't own, and he flew high above it with one of the lunatics
who took it away. "How then is it that such a perfect
society, the Tanzanian nation, has continued getting poorer?"
Mr. Sorman asks Tanzania's Julius Nyerere.
   "It's Reagan's fault; Margaret Thatcher caught him and the
infection spread even to Mitterrand]" Mr. Nyerere screams
over the roaring engines. When Tanzania's maximum leader
ponders dwindling revenues from once-profitable cashew crops,
he blames prices set by free-market "imperialists" somewhere
far away. He does not blame his own state monopoly that pays
peasants an unrealistically low price for which they just
will not grow lots of those little nuts.
   It seems that Mr. Nyerere didn't get around to reading
Smith when he studied in Scotland of all places, though he's
pretty fluent in socialist slogans. The sight of Third
Worldians the world over proudly replacing colonial shackles
with Western left-wing ideologies never fails to enchant Mr.
Sorman. Encounters with innovative thinkers never fail to
elate him.
   "I would render ill service to my people if I made them
pay, like the rest of the continent, for their independence
with poverty," says Gatsha Buthelezi, chief of South Africa's
seven million Zulus. Unfashionably pro-capitalist, unlike
Nelson Mandela, Chief Buthelezi doesn't get much space in the
Western media, which cheers the rejection of socialism in
Eastern Europe but welcomes it eagerly in South Africa. There
are many ironies in the world and in this book.
   There also is much that is out-of-date. Since "The New
Wealth of Nations" was first published in France in 1987,
much has changed in the Third World landscapes that Mr.
Sorman describes in a jargon-free, breezy prose nicely
captured by Asha Puri. Updating here and there, Mr. Sorman
does refer to Tiananmen Square, if only to enter the massacre
as evidence that China's gerontocracy will continue to
maintain a clear-cut distinction between economics and
politics. "The instruments of central, civil and military
power are being modernized in China," he writes, but only to
consolidate the power base, not to affect the development of
society as a whole."
   Curiously, Mr. Sorman makes no mention of Mexico's ongoing
attempts at reform (including privatizing agriculture),
though the meeting he had with Octavio Paz, the wise old
chronicler of Mexican misdeeds, remains interesting reading
and sets up most of the book. Why is it, Mr. Paz asks, that
the Mexican who in his country conforms to the "cliche of the
passive, lazy peasant, suddenly becomes hardworking and
enterprising when he crosses the border? Is it not proof that
poverty and servility are products of the Mexican political
system rather than deriving from historical or natural
causes?"
   The way Mr. Sorman sees it, less government always is
better. Socialism has not brought ongoing progress to any
country; state capitalism has only dramatized the gap between
rich and poor with its grotesque emphasis on
industrialization and bloated public sector. And
international aid packages mostly entrench and enrich the
bureaucracy. If countries can't repay their debts, writes Mr.
Sorman, it is because most of the billions have been
redirected to private bank accounts. Why don't we hear more
about shameless stealing come restructuring time? he wonders.
   Why, for that matter, is not more made of the Soviet aid
package to Cuba? Still $4 billion plus, it's a sum that could
help retire the annoying begging bowl Mikhail Gorbachev
travels with on the Beltway. In an amusing chapter, Mr.
Sorman reports how he fell into a hypnotic stupor listening
to Cuba's minister of health droning on about the wonderful
network of polyclinics sprouting like cigars all over the
sunny isle. "Was it really necessary," he asks, "to force a
million Cubans to go into exile, curtail individual liberty,
and imprison political opponents by the thousands so that the
Cuban people could have good teeth?"

   The NATO summit now meeting in London has been described
as the organization's most important gathering in 40 years.
Perhaps. The remaking of the political and economic map of
the West is indeed a daunting task. But on the basis of what
has been reported out of the summit so far, the one thing
we'd say doesn't need much changing or fixing is NATO itself.
As a political organization, it appears to be working quite
well.
   It may not seem like much to say that a political grouping
is running smoothly until you look around at the other
systems, many in the West, that seem to be forever wasting
their energies on marginal political obsessions. NATO has
indeed kept the peace for 40 years, which suggests that
somehow it has avoided fatal mistakes and found its way to
important and sustainable policies, such as summoning the
courage and will to deploy the Pershing missiles at a
critical point in the Cold War.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So far, the participants at the current NATO summit are
behaving in a level-headed manner -- avoiding the more
credulous instincts of some analysts and even combining to
resist the more utopian impulses of individual members.
   Consider, for instance, that the big news out of
yesterday's session was President Bush's proposal to invite
Mikhail Gorbachev to address the North Atlantic Council in
Brussels. This idea seems in keeping with the apparently "de
rigueur" public-relations component of international
relations today. NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner of
West Germany, a clear-eyed hawk on military matters, had
opened the session by calling on the alliance to extend a
hand of friendship to the East. If Mr. Bush's invitation
meant that the NATO leadership actually wanted to clasp the
Soviet Union to its collective security breast, that would be
cause for worry. But, as Helmut Kohl discovered, NATO still
is able to separate matters of substance from symbolic
gestures.
   Mr. Kohl wanted a joint non-aggression declaration with
the Warsaw Pact countries that "we no longer regard one
another as adversaries." French President Francois
Mitterrand, with U.S. support, allowed as how this was not an
idea whose time had come. In the quaint but clear diplomatic
phrase of a Canadian official, Mr. Kohl's proposal was
"losing speed." Meanwhile, Mr. Bush's flamboyant notion that
NATO should alter its policy to say it would use nuclear
weapons only as a "last resort" drew a mixed response at
best.
   Or take the hot question of extending financial credits or
direct aid to the Soviets. Mr. Gorbachev went so far
yesterday as to send the summit meeting a message, appealing
for Western aid, and the Germans and French are pressing the
allies to do exactly that. But the U.S., Britain and Japan
have countered that any big aid package would be wasted now,
a view that surely comports with the reality of Soviet
economic disarray.
   Two days ago, Secretary of State Jim Baker had told a
meeting of Western aid donors that Soviet support for
satellites such as Cuba and its continued high rates of
military spending were impediments to aid. Meanwhile Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney noted in Oslo Wednesday that Norwegian
intelligence had picked up the Soviet transfer of 40 MiG-27
fighter bombers from Hungary to the Soviet Northern Fleet on
the Arctic Kola Peninsula, suggesting a continued Soviet
interest in NATO's strategically important flanks to the
north and south.
   All of this suggests to us that notwithstanding the
euphoria over communism's fall, there are still people inside
the NATO alliance who are keeping an eye on the ball. The
Cold War may be "over," but Yogi Berra's central insight was
never truer: It isn't over till it's over. Remember, 480,000
Soviet troops remain on German soil.
   The great unwinding of Soviet communism has just begun.
But reports out of the Soviet Party Congress suggest just how
tightly the Communist Party, no matter how bankrupt, is
coiled around that nation's life.
   The world is changing. NATO is changing. However, it is
far too early for the NATO alliance, as some are suggesting,
to radically alter its purpose or its membership. The deep
seriousness of NATO's reason for being -- the continued peace
and security of the West -- has through its complex
interdependencies managed to keep bad ideas to a minimum
while the alliance's core mission remained strong. In a time
of transition, it would be no small thing to have NATO's
sturdy presence intact.

   For Chinese Speculators, the Streets Offer
   Better Deals Than the Stock Exchange

   SHENZHEN, China -- The fledgling stock market in this
Chinese laboratory of capitalism is facing its first scandal:
an epidemic of outsider trading.
   In Shenzhen, high rollers shun the official stock exchange
in favor of dealing on the street just outside. There, they
speculate feverishly -- and illegally -- forcing stock prices
skyward and arousing concern among China's economic planners,
who still find the notion of stock markets distasteful.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is the best place in all of China to make money,"
says Liang Xing, as he works the crowd to find a buyer for
his 10,000-share certificate of Vanke Co., one of Shenzhen's
five publicly listed companies. Mr. Liang says he can make
$45 a day trading, or as much as many Chinese workers earn in
a month. His secret? "I buy low and sell high," he says with
a laugh.
   This wasn't what officials envisioned when they opened
Shenzhen's miniature stock exchange two years ago. In
Shenzhen and other select cities, authorities have allowed a
few companies to issue stock to raise investment capital and
help soak up excess savings. While officials have permitted
secondary markets to develop, they have tried to discourage
the wild speculation that fuels trading on Shenzhen's Red
Lychee Avenue, dubbed China's Wall Street by some local
traders.
   This year, traders in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese
"special economic zone" adjacent to Hong Kong and susceptible
to the British colony's laissez-faire ways, have engineered
China's first bull market. In the first four months of the
year, Shenzhen traders swapped shares valued at a total of
nearly $13 million, double the value of stock trading in all
of China last year, according to government estimates. Most
Shenzhen transactions occurred on the black market.
   The bull market has caused the share prices of Shenzhen's
listed enterprises to surge. Vanke, a manufacturing and
trading concern, made its debut last year by issuing 28
million shares at the equivalent of 21 cents each. Now,
black-market traders are getting as much as 50 cents a share,
an increase of 138%.
   Fang Chenli, a young man wearing a T-shirt bearing the
Playboy logo, is trying to sell 1,000 shares of Champagne
Industrial Co. for the equivalent of $3.40 a share. At the
exchange, the posted price is only $3. Black-market buyers
are often willing to pay a premium because it can take more
than a week to receive share certificates from the official
exchange.
   The 1,000 shares Mr. Fang is hawking are registered in
someone else's name, but Mr. Fang carries a photocopy of that
person's identity card. Both the 1,000-share certificate and
the ID-card copy have changed hands several times since the
shares were first purchased more than a year ago.
   For months, authorities allowed Shenzhen's illegal stock
trading to flourish. But the government's patience is wearing
thin. Last month, authorities called for an end to stock
trading outside the official exchange. For now, government
moves have restrained the black market, but it remains to be
seen if they will succeed in the long run.
   "Ours is a stock market with socialist characteristics,"
says Zhou Daozhi, a Shenzhen official of the People's Bank of
China, which oversees share issues. "Socialist
characteristics," Mr. Zhou explains, is code for not allowing
wild price swings and for ensuring that stock tenders don't
exceed 50% of state-owned enterprises.
   "The purpose of our stock market is definitely not to
privatize state companies," Mr. Zhou says.
   Such statements show how far China has retreated from
plans to use share issues to speed privatization and resolve
the thorny question of business ownership in a socialist
economy. Proponents of reform argue that if state enterprises
are owned by "the whole people," as is the case now in China,
no one has to bear the responsibility for enterprise losses.
   Zhao Ziyang, who was sacked as Communist Party chief after
the suppression of last year's pro-democracy movement, once
saw the widespread sale of stock in state-owned enterprises
as a major goal of China's economic reform. Mr. Zhao even
sang the praises of stock markets in a 1988 meeting in
Beijing with conservative U.S. economist Milton Friedman.
   Control of the Chinese economy has since passed to more
cautious hands, and many ambitious reform plans have been
scrapped. Beijing's current hard-line government has
criticized Mr. Zhao's meeting with Mr. Friedman as a
precursor to the democracy movement, which Beijing dismisses
as a "counter-revolutionary rebellion."
   Shenzhen officials cautiously predict that their stock
market will come to resemble a Western-style stock exchange,
though they say they need time to study how such exchanges
work.
   For some tips, they might head out to Red Lychee Avenue
and talk to people like Chan Wing-ming, a 21-year-old office
worker. Mr. Chan has earned a few thousand dollars -- a small
fortune in China -- trading stocks on the street in his spare
time. "Whenever I need money, I come here to trade," he says,
scanning the crowd for potential buyers. "Look, I'd like to
talk more, but I've got to go. Time is money."

   Gannett Expected
   To End 22 Years
   Of Earnings Gains

   NEW YORK -- Gannett Co. is expected to report its first
quarterly earnings drop from a year earlier since the company
went public more than 22 years ago, ending one of the longer
streaks in corporate annals and signaling that an
industrywide slump has finally taken hold at the country's
largest newspaper company.
   Gannett's vice chairman and chief financial officer,
Douglas McCorkindale said in an interview yesterday that he
can't disagree with the conclusions of some Wall Street
analysts, who expect the company to post second-quarter net
income below the year-earlier $112.1 million, or 70 cents a
share. In May, ad revenues fell 4.3% at Gannett's 82 daily
newspapers, and "business continues to be soft. We aren't
seeing any significant business in June," Mr. McCorkindale
said. He declined to predict any specific figures and said
the company will issue its second-quarter report next week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Peter Appert, an analyst at C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell
Inc., expects Gannett to report earnings of about $109.7
million, or 68 cents a share, for the second quarter. "It's
not a conclusion I'll disagree with," Mr. McCorkindale said
of the analyst's forecast.
   Mr. Appert said Gannett's earnings are being hurt by
continued weak retail and classified newspaper linage at the
company's dailies. "The simple fact," he added, "is that
Gannett will continue to report disappointing earnings until
the ad revenue environment improves."
   Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analyst Susan Decker also
expects results to be down slightly, although earnings could
be flat after counting a small gain from the recent sale of a
Gannett radio station. She expects classified advertising
will "continue to get worse" for Gannett and most newspaper
companies. She added that major newspaper companies' earnings
growth, which averaged about 15% through the past decade,
will slow to about 8% for the 1990s.
   The gloomy projections come at a crucial time for Gannett.
The Gannett Foundation, the company's largest shareholder,
plans to sell its 10% stake, raising the possibility that
Gannett may be put into play as a possible takeover target --
particularly if its stock price falls on bad earnings news.
   The foundation, headed by former Gannett Chairman Allen
Neuharth, is sorting through several potential bidders and
waiting for the company's stock price to rebound. Shares
traded as high as $55.25 in 1987 and were at $36.75 when the
foundation announced the planned sale on April 26. The stock
has been slowly rising since. It closed yesterday at $37.125
a share, down 37.5 cents, in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   In the past, Gannett executives have boasted of the string
of earnings gains. Even in the recent ad slump, Gannett, with
papers spread across 36 states, has managed to post some of
the industry's strongest earnings. Earnings at most other
major publishers have been weakened by declines in retail and
classified ad spending, particularly in Northeastern states.
   Gannett went public in October 1967 and since then has
logged earnings gains from the year-earlier period for 89
consecutive quarters. Gannett barely kept the string alive in
the first quarter of 1990, posting net earnings of $75
million, or 47 cents a share, only $100,000 higher than in
the year-earlier quarter.

   An Independence Day for Europe

   PRAGUE -- The most curious Fourth of July parade of the
year formed in the wide boulevard known to the world as
Wenceslas Square. Under overcast and chilly skies,
unrecognizable flags flowed up the avenue between planters of
red petunias and around concentric circles of marigolds and
geraniums. Beneath the statue of a mounted St. Wenceslas,
with the neo-Renaissance National Museum looming behind, 50
or so marchers stopped before an unplanted muddy circle,
dipped their flags, laid red, yellow and white carnations,
and departed in silence.
   The carnations bedecked a ring of paraffin, innumerable
candles having burned themselves into a wall around the mud.
Within this fortification stood many five-liter jars and cans
for flowers, a stake with a braided tinfoil crown, and
pictures of Czech heroes. At the center was the largest, a
photo of young Jan Palach, who burned himself to death on
this spot in January 1969 in protest of the quenching of
Prague's Spring by Soviet tanks a few months earlier.

<TEXT>
   One of the flags -- green, red and blue bars with a star
and crescent -- flew over an independent Azerbaijan from 1918
to 1920. Free Georgia lasted from 1918 to 1921; its flag had
a maroon field, with a black bar over a white bar in the
corner. "Black for the past, white for the future, and maroon
for the robe of Christ buried in Georgia," its bearer
explained. There were also luckier flags, those of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia, restored to use in their homelands in the
past two years. The one recognizable flag was that of Israel,
flown for Soviet Jewry. The most curious was a blue
background with a yellow symbol looking like a horseshoe
divided by a bar; it was the symbol of the Crimean Tatars,
dating from the third or fourth century.
   The marchers had come to one of the world's newest
democracies to celebrate the American Declaration of
Independence 214 years earlier. Some had carried their flags
from within the Soviet Union, and some from various places of
exile around the world. They sought for their homelands the
independence and democracy of America and Czechoslovakia.
Czech President Vaclav Havel welcomed them at the July 4
opening of "The Peaceful Road to Democracy," their three-day
public conference. "You are dissidents; this means you are
people who are waging your struggle on the basis of the ideal
of human rights." He added that he too had been a dissident
and political prisoner, and had learned "the indivisibility
of freedom and justice. If they are threatened anywhere they
are threatened everywhere."
   These Soviets and former Soviets had hard-won credentials
as democrats. The meeting was organized by prominent exiles;
it was opened by author Vladimir Bukovsky and Armenian leader
Paruyr Hayrikyan. They were joined by equally brave souls who
still reside in the Soviet Union, including world chess
champion Gary Kasparov and Gennadi Burbulis, spokesman for
the anti-Gorbachev interregional group within the official
Congress of People's Deputies. They joined in a simple
message: The West should understand that Mikhail Gorbachev
does not represent reform.
   "Unable to govern and concerned only about preserving
their own power, Gorbachev and his colleagues in the
leadership are willingly or unwillingly dragging the country
toward the abyss of civil war," declares the delegates'
resolution, the Prague Appeal. "We appeal to the public and
the governments of the West not to support Gorbachev and his
`perestroika' which is pushing the country to the brink of
destruction. Your support is needed by the democratic forces
opposing the communist regime."
   A question about Mr. Gorbachev sets off an emotional round
of statements from various delegates. It was under Mr.
Gorbachev, they point out, that troops were sent into Tbilisi
and Baku; bloodshed has already occurred. Under Mr.
Gorbachev, they say, the KGB continues to foment ethnic
strife; the nationalist, anti-Semitic Pamyat "exists only
because of the KGB." Despite hard-line attacks on Mr.
Gorbachev's policies at the current Party Congress, the
delegates see Mr. Gorbachev as the hard-liners' man and his
reforms as mere concessions to the reality that the system
has not worked.
   The Soviet Union is "the disappearing state," says chess
champion Kasparov, and Western worries about a hard-line
alternative without Mr. Gorbachev are "a Christmas tale." The
delegates complain that "the West has underestimated or even
ignored the democratic forces emerging inside." They point
out that Pamyat candidates pulled only 1% of the vote in
elections. Despite shooting in the Caucasian republics, they
take a benign view of the Red Army; Mr. Bukovsky says the
troops "are people; they have families."
   Most of all, delegates don't want a new leader; they want
a much bigger change. "We are not an opposition to the
Communist Party within the system; we want to end the entire
totalitarian system," says Sergei Skripnikov of the
Democratic Union in Moscow. "The people of the Ukraine have
been part of the most terrible experiment in the history of
mankind, the making of a new society in the name of Marx and
Lenin," says Anatoly Shibyko of Rukh, the Ukrainian group he
says counted 280,000 members as of September.
   These attitudes leave an ambivalence about Boris Yeltsin,
who is seen in the West as the main democratic opponent of
Mr. Gorbachev -- but who, after all, has played a prominent
part in the Communist system. Anatoly Koryagin, a
psychiatrist jailed and exiled for opposing political abuse
of psychiatry, sees Messrs. Gorbachev and Yeltsin in
alliance, or potential alliance, to perpetuate the system by
combining Mr. Gorbachev's popularity outside the Soviet Union
and Mr. Yeltsin's popularity within. Mr. Bukovsky, while
saying Mr. Yeltsin retains much of his socialist outlook,
sees him as a positive step: "He's evolving; he's
developing."
   The prospect of Western aid for the present regime leaves
the delegates here nearly frantic. Mr. Kasparov derides
attitudes of Western leaders, for example a statement by
Margaret Thatcher that reunification of Germany might become
an issue "in the next 10 years," and complains that the West
is now readying $18 billion to $20 billion in aid for the
Soviet Union. Armando Valladares, the most famous exile from
Fidel Castro's prisons, notes that the Soviet Union still
provides an unrepentent Castro with massive financial
support, and observes, "Aid the Soviet Union receives from
the West should not be used to maintain a dictatorship in
Cuba."
   Some of the rhetoric in the conference hall here carries
echoes of political exiles throughout history. Pretenders to
this throne have wandered the world for generations waiting
for their opponents to collapse from within. And with the
small exiled bands comes an amateurish streak, as when a huge
map of Soviet republics is taken down just before the
official opening, apparently because of its depiction of
Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.
   Yet, in fact, the open and civilized debate over
Nagorno-Karabakh at the conference is truly impressive,
especially since both Armenian and Azeri delegates agree that
the recent inter-ethnic conflict was provoked from Moscow.
And the lost-cause echoes die when the listener remembers
that half of the delegates come from within the Soviet Union.
Especially so after the events of 1989, when communist
regimes here in Czechoslovakia and elsewhere in Eastern
Europe did indeed crack from within, despite secret police
and local and even Soviet troops. Given this, surely Western
governments and opinion leaders ought at least to listen to
the kind of voices heard here.
   Paruyr Hayrikyan, forcibly exiled to Ethiopia in 1988, won
91% of the vote when he ran for a seat in the Armenian
Supreme Soviet in the elections last May. Paul Weyrich, the
American political activist, reports that when he tried to
get Vice President Dan Quayle to present a dinner award to
Mr. Hayrikyan, the White House decided the exile was "a
destabilizing influence." Similarly, delegates here are still
angry over the shabby White House reception of Lithuanian
Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, who was stopped for gate
security like an everyday visitor.
   The exiles here, too, have personally earned a hearing by
simple human courage. Mr. Hayrikyan spent 16 years in Soviet
labor camps. Mr. Bukovsky served 12, Mr. Koryagin seven.
Ayshe Seytmuratova served three as spokeswoman for the
Crimean Tatars, whom Stalin forcibly relocated to Central
Asia. Poetess Irina Ratushinskaya was sentenced to 12 years
including 120 days of solitary confinement, although she was
released early -- two days before the Reykjavik summit.
   Others tell stories even more related to the symbolism of
a Prague July Fourth. Yakov Suslensky, a Jewish activist now
in Israel, was sentenced to seven years for writing a letter
opposing the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia. Vladimir
Dremlyuaga served six years as one of seven Russians
protesting the invasion in Red Square -- the first Russian
political demonstration, he says, in 51 years. Petro Ruban, a
woodcarver, served a total of 22 years; one of his four
arrests was for sculpting a Statue of Liberty to celebrate
the American bicentennial.
   Western leaders and Western governments have been
instrumental in rescuing most of these people from Soviet
prison camps, but tend to ignore them once they are free.
Western governments are understandably interested in the
welfare of their own people, not in righting the wrongs of
Soviet society. But exiles can claim some painfully won
understanding of the forces in their own society. And after
1989, there's room to wonder which is the best practitioner
of "Realpolitik," the State Department or the exiles.
   In any event, whether celebrated with strange flags or
not, the Fourth of July is about more than fireworks and
barbecues. The century in which we live has horrors worse
than taxation without representation, but Jefferson's words
still ring of something deep in the nature of man. The
Soviets who gathered to celebrate Independence Day in Prague
came only to claim their inalienable rights.

   We keep thinking of how Yankee pitcher Andy Hawkins lost a
no-hitter because a rookie left-fielder dropped a fly ball.
"That's baseball," shrugged the rookie. Sad but true. Why, we
ask, should baseball continue as if it were still possible to
find a league's worth of young players who can hit, field and
chew gum at the same time? Perhaps baseball ought to consider
revising the pathetic spectacle of shortstops who bat .200
and slugging outfielders who can't catch. Maybe baseball
should do what everyone else has done: Specialize. Instead of
one designated hitter, how about nine designated hitters and
nine designated fielders? Traditionalists would scream, but,
Pop, times have changed since you were a boy. Kids don't play
pickup baseball all day anymore; they play only in organized
leagues, which means some rookies arrive in the Majors with
the fielding skills of a Little Leaguer. Let kids see what
real fielding and batting used to look like, before they're
extinct.

   Jacobs, Amway Sell Most of Holdings
   In Avon Products to Chartwell Partners

TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)
HOUSEHOLD AND PERSONAL-CARE PRODUCTS (HHP)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs and Amway
Corp. have sold most of their stake in Avon Products Inc. to
two partners in Chartwell Associates L.P., Avon's largest
shareholder.
   Mr. Jacobs said he sold the shares because he recently
concluded that a hostile takeover of Avon was impossible. The
stock purchase, however, appears to give Chartwell greater
bargaining leverage with Avon management, Wall Street
analysts said. Although few believe a tender offer is
imminent, one analyst said Avon's management may be pressured
into leading a leveraged buy-out of the giant cosmetics and
gift company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Altogether Chartwell acquired 3.976 million shares of Avon
from A/J Partnership, which is controlled by Mr. Jacobs and
Amway, a direct-selling company based in Ada, Mich. Chartwell
paid approximately $37.50 a share, or $149.1 million, for a
stake equivalent to 7% of Avon's common. Chartwell also
agreed to buy another 1.233 million Avon shares from A/J
Partnership within 30 days.
   Chartwell's acquisition follows a court decision last week
invalidating an attempt by Avon to reduce the threshold of
the company's share rights plan to 12.5% from 20%. If the
courts had ruled in favor of Avon, Chartwell would have been
forced to keep its Avon holdings under that 12.5% level or
activate the anti-takeover defenses.
   When both purchases are complete, Chartwell will own 14.8
million shares of Avon common, or 26.2%. According to John
Cox, an Avon spokesman, Chartwell's voting stake will then
amount to 19.8%, slightly below the 20% level at which Avon's
shareholder-rights plan becomes effective. Included among
Chartwell's holdings are 50,000 shares of Avon preferred.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Avon shares closed at $37, down 75 cents apiece.
   Chartwell includes Mary Kay Corp. Vice Chairman John
Rochon; the Fisher real estate family of New York, and oil
heir Gordon Getty. The shares purchased from A/J Parthership
were acquired by Mr. Getty and the Fisher family a little
more than a week after a pact calling for Mr. Rochon to serve
as an Avon consultant ended suddenly. Avon and Chartwell had
agreed to Mr. Rochon's presence, as well as the creation of a
special advisory committee and the election of two Chartwell
candidates to Avon's board, as part of an accord to avoid a
costly tender fight.
   In an interview, Mr. Jacobs said he sold the stake because
he had lost faith in Avon's management and because he has
concluded that circumstances today "make it impossible to do
a hostile takeover. I decided there is no longer any reason
for us to have positions in our portfolio of a hostile
sense."
   Thus resolved, the investor said he called the Fisher
brothers last week and indicated the block was available.
Final details weren't worked out until yesterday morning, Mr.
Jacobs said.
   Although the Fishers -- together with Mr. Getty -- agreed
to buy 5.2 million of the 5.7 million shares held by the
Jacobs-Amway partnership, Mr. Jacobs declined to say whether
A/J Partnership continues to hold any Avon shares.
   Mr. Jacobs wouldn't say why the sale is being done in two
parts, other than to cite "technical reasons." The investor
said the partnership realized a profit of about $63 million
and netted slightly more than $50 million after carrying
costs. Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission show that the partnership paid between $21.875 and
$32.29 for its shares.
   Amway and Mr. Jacobs separately made offers to acquire
Avon last year but each were rebuffed.
   An Avon spokesman said the company wasn't surprised that
Mr. Jacobs and Amway had agreed to sell their shares. "We
never thought of A/J Partnership as long-term investors, and
the sale of their stock eliminates a major source of
instability in Avon's ownership," said Mr. Cox. "Chartwell
has said it is a long-term investor, and their acquisition
today would seem to confirm that." James Preston, chairman
and chief executive officer of Avon, declined to be
interviewed.
   Analysts who follow Avon suggested that the new Chartwell
acquisitions will give the partnership additional clout with
Avon management but they doubt a tender offer is likely soon.
   "What this does is give Chartwell a stronger hand in terms
of influencing management," said Abraham Karp, president of
the Karp Financial Group, a Tarrytown, N.Y., institutional
research firm. "Avon let a superb machine run down, and
Chartwell will now push to make the company more profitable."
   Andrew Shore, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., suggested that Chartwell may be trying to force Avon's
management to take the company private.
   "There really isn't a strong reason for Avon to be public
because the company doesn't have capital needs," said Mr.
Shore. "When the domestic business achieves the right profit
margins, the business is self-financed." Although Mr. Shore
believes a tender offer is unlikely at this time, he
suggested that a bid of $41 a share would be enough to win
Avon.

   MOSCOW -- When Western leaders meet in Houston next week,
the U.S. and Britain plan to argue that a controversial plan
for massive aid to the Soviet Union is premature.
Surprisingly, leading Soviet economists and officials agree.
   West Germany and France have proposed an immediate $15
billion infusion of international aid, while Britain and the
U.S. say cash won't do any good unless serious economic
reforms are in place. Soviet economists say that the help
would be welcome, but that the country simply isn't ready to
absorb it yet.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I'm not sure such aid today would be effective," says
Oleg Bogomolov, an influential radical economist. "It won't
solve any of the cardinal problems."
   Even Soviet government officials reject the quick fix of
using Western funds to fill empty Soviet shelves. "All the
money in the world probably won't be enough to speed up
economic reform if we only do it through consumer goods,"
says Andrei Bugrov, a Foreign Ministry official specializing
in international economic relations.
   Before any aid could be effective, some Western and Soviet
experts argue, the country must start price reforms,
industrial privatization, reconstructing its banking system
and building better supports for foreign investment. Linking
the aid to such economic conditions could actually help
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev push through unpopular
reforms.
   But political conditions would be out of the question,
Soviet officials say. And many countries that are considering
participating in the aid plan clearly have their own
political agendas.
   West Germany, which initiated the idea, wants Soviet
acceptance of German reunification. The U.S. says it might
not participate unless the Soviet Union stops funding Cuba
and cuts its own military spending. Japan, now the world's
biggest creditor, won't give economic aid until it and Moscow
resolve their dispute over four islands north of Japan that
the Soviet Union has held since 1945.
   "Any intention to call the Soviet Union on the carpet in
Houston and dictate political conditions is extremely
unrealistic," wrote Lev Strzhizhovsky in Pravda, the
Communist Party daily. "There can be only one approach and
everyone in Houston should know it: `yes' to assistance, but
`no' to political conditions."
   The aid package is likely to dominate discussions at the
Houston meeting of seven major industrial nations. The G-7
summit participants -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada -- are split on whether giving aid
is a good idea at all, and if so, how to go about it.
   The goal of France and West Germany is to help Moscow
through a difficult transition from 70 years of command
economy to a supply-and-demand market system. As a statement
of support for Mr. Gorbachev and his perestroika policies,
the aid plan emerged at the right time, just before the
crucial congress of the Communist Party that is now under way
and which could determine whether perestroika continues or
stalls.
   Last year, the G-7 countries called on the Soviets to
undertake specific economic reforms. Since then, several
reforms have been proferred and rejected, and the Soviet
economy has spiraled downward. Inflation is estimated at 10%,
the budget deficit last year hit 100 billion rubles ($170
billion at the official exchange rate or $16 billion at the
more realistic tourist rate), and hard currency debt now
stands at about $45 billion.
   When West Germany first suggested the aid plan last month,
it clearly wanted to give Mr. Gorbachev quick relief until a
more acceptable reform program could get off the ground. Some
of the money was proposed for food and consumer goods, to get
products on the shelves immediately.
   On its own late last year, the Gorbachev government
imported about 10 billion rubles of soap, food and clothing
in an attempt to soothe the tempers of striking miners and
frustrated city shoppers. At first the shipments did the
trick, but within a month the shelves were bare again and
nothing fundamental had changed.
   Many Soviet economists say that's the reason aid should be
linked to specific economic reforms or sorely needed
infrastructure such as roads and telecommunications. The
money must be earmarked for specific investments to avoid the
problems that plagued Poland in the 1970s, when tens of
billions of dollars of foreign investment and loans were
wasted, leaving the country with a huge foreign debt and lots
of outmoded equipment.
   Frustrated by the government's cautious approach to
reform, other Soviet economists say attaching economic
conditions to the aid could be just the lever needed to get
things moving. Without such external pressure, the stumbling
blocks in the way of economic reform will take too long to
remove.

   Michael D. Copeland's June 7 editorial-page article, "No
Red Squirrels? Mother Nature May Be Better Off," says that
the use by environmentalists of the Endangered Species Act
"is often a subterfuge for achieving other goals, such as the
prevention of development."
   Subterfuge, as I understand it, implies dishonesty at
worst, evasion at best. It doesn't fit. We use the Endangered
Species Act -- along with the National Environmental Policy
Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and scores of
other laws -- to achieve environmental protection.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Copeland attacked my colleague Andy Stahl for
acknowledging that the spotted owl was a useful ally in the
campaign to save a little of the pitiful remnant of
old-growth forest that still stands in the Pacific Northwest.
"Evidently, Mr. Stahl is more concerned with old-growth
timber than with the spotted owl," wrote Mr. Copeland, as if
that were a crime. Of course our goal is to protect old
growth: You can't have spotted owls without it. No one has
ever denied, to my knowledge, that we are in favor of
preserving old growth.
   Mr. Copeland exhibits considerable bravery in advocating
the extinction of species we know very little about. Bravery?
Make that arrogance. Historic extinctions caused by nature
are not necessarily equivalent to extinctions caused by man.
The latter reflect decidedly unnatural upsets and imbalances
in natural systems that we perpetuate at our peril.

   Using Mr. Copeland's logic, it could be argued that the
world would be better off without giant pandas, California
condors, the American bald eagle and developmentally disabled
people. Just who is to decide what species (or class) should
be sacrificed?
   Perhaps he should note that the past extinction of species
as a natural byproduct of evolution was not generally
something that happened overnight as a result of some
developer's whim or greed.

   I take exception to Mr. Copeland's contention that many of
the world's species are irrelevant since they stand in the
way of development projects.
   He makes two specious arguments. The first is that natural
mass extinctions, such as that of the dinosaurs, permit the
human race to extinguish more species or certain subspecies.
I assert on moral grounds that the human race has no such
right. Mr. Copeland's second argument is that biological
diversity, such as the existence of subspecies within one
species, is of no value. That argument is in serious error,
as demonstrated by the medical-research value of certain
species to humans as well as the interdependence of various
species within certain ecological systems. In certain cases,
the loss of one species can cause the collapse of an entire
system.
   In conclusion, I agree that development decisions should
not be totally blocked due to ecological considerations.
However, such development must clearly carry the burden of
proof that species extinction would not be the result. A
mountaintop observatory is not worth the extinction of any
species.
   James H. Maitland

   ---
   In response to Mr. Copeland's squirrel bashing and
greed-motivated rationalizations on the future of endangered
species, he quotes Harvard Prof. Stephen Gould on his
assessments of mass extinctions through time, stating that
today's species represent less than 1% of all species that
have ever existed. Extinctions of species through time were
caused by natural forces, before man ever walked on this
earth. Man is omnipotent when it comes to survival. He can
easily wipe out anything of his choosing. If we allow bending
of the rules of the Endangered Species Act, when would it
stop? We should be doing all we can to save that 1%.

   Mr. Copeland's critique relies on arguments that belittle
the benefits of "individual animal or plant categories." We
can test the persuasiveness of those arguments if we
substitute the phrase "individual humans or class of humans"
for "individual animal or plant categories" and if we imagine
Mr. Copeland is not disputing the wisdom of this law, but
rather the wisdom of laws against murder and genocide.
   His assertions could then be paraphrased as follows: (1)
More than 95% of all humans who have ever lived are now dead;
(2) despite these many deaths, the human population is
actually increasing, past deaths making room for present
numbers; (3) nature obviously entails death as well as life,
so we may be wasting time, effort and money on humans who
will die over time regardless of our efforts; (4) human
traits that have helped folks survive in the past are not
particularly important to future longevity, so preserving
lives will not necessarily increase the life span of folks to
come.
   All these statements may be true. They are not necessarily
meaningful, however. They fail regarding human exterminations
for the same two reasons Mr. Copeland's arguments fail
regarding animal extinctions. First, he implicitly assumes
that teleological benefit-cost ethics are the only ones
relevant to decision-making in this case. Such ethics serve
nonmoral ends such as consumer welfare. He ignores imperative
ethics that find rightness or wrongness intrinsic to deeds
themselves, e.g., "Thou shalt not kill."
   Mr. Copeland could defend himself by saying that
imperative ethics should be ignored when it comes to keeping
people alive; that we should, for example, calculate the
benefits before spending added costs of, say $300 billion a
year on more medical care for the expiring elderly; and that
imperative ethics should likewise be ignored for species
preservation. This would be a good answer for Mr. Copeland if
by "species preservation" he meant efforts to keep alive
species that would die naturally from causes unrelated to
mankind's actions, just as it is a good argument when
considering health care for hopelessly ill humans. But we are
not talking about "species preservation" in this sense, which
brings us to the second flaw.
   The Endangered Species Act attempts to outlaw
exterminations of species insofar as they are caused by human
overharvesting or habitat destruction. People may find
imperative ethics useful here -- even imperative. Such ethics
are useful in assessing the genocide of the Tasmanian
Aborigines and our laws against the painful slaughter of
animals, not to mention more obvious matters. Similarly, the
Endangered Species Act reflects our attempt to apply
imperative ethics to the way we treat other species, not the
way Mother Nature treats them.
   These distinctions are critical. If Mr. Copeland could
convince us that the conscious taking of life forever lies on
the same moral plane as letting it expire naturally, then
teleological ethics might overrule imperative ethics, and his
arguments depreciating the benefits of individual species
might be meaningful.

   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. -- A state court judge dismissed a
class-action lawsuit filed by Cablevision Systems Corp.
subscribers, charging the cable-TV operator with fraud,
restraint of trade and false advertising.
   The suit stemmed from a dispute between Cablevision and
the Madison Square Garden Network sports cable channel. MSG
is a subsidiary of Paramount Communications Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In September 1988, a contract under which Cablevision
carried the MSG network as an optional service expired. MSG
had wanted Cablevision to carry the sports network as part of
a basic package. From mid-September until July 5, 1989, the
network wasn't carried on Cablevision at all.
   The subscribers charged that Cablevision was obligated to
reduce its rates while it didn't carry MSG, and they demanded
damages from the company.
   In dismissing the suit June 29, Judge John Copertino said
that when Cablevision started carrying MSG, the Woodbury,
N.Y., cable operator couldn't have known that the network
would become unavailable. Further, the court said, once the
dispute arose, Cablevision notified its subscribers that MSG
might become unavailable, and "all a dissatisfied customer
had to do was cancel the more-expensive package or terminate
the relationship in its entirety."
   On the issue of restraint of trade, the subscribers failed
to show a conspiracy existed to keep MSG out of Cablevision's
offerings, the court said. Cablevision also runs
SportsChannel, a sports network that competes with MSG.
   And the subscribers didn't show that at the time they
subscribed, "MSG was unavailable and that the advertising
complained of was then being run, rendering such advertising
or inducements to take service based on MSG's availability
`deceptive,'" the court said.
   Cablevision and MSG settled their dispute in July 1989; in
most of Cablevision's systems, MSG remained optional. It will
be an option on all Cablevision systems after the 1990
baseball season.
   Cablevision did reach agreements with state regulators to
make refunds to some subscribers. In November 1989, it agreed
to refund $490,545 to Connecticut subscribers; and in January
1990, it agreed to refunds in New York totaling as much as
$1.1 million. The company wasn't found to have violated any
laws or regulations.
   Thomas J. Sinnickson, the subscribers' attorney in Center
Moriches, N.Y., said the plaintiffs will seek to reargue the
case "based on new evidence arising from certain admissions"
Cablevision made in its settlement agreement in New York. The
plaintiffs also will file an appeal with a higher state
court, he added.

   NEW YORK -- Five insiders at Players International Inc.
sold $2.5 million of the company's stock less than two weeks
before the share price plunged abruptly last month, filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.
   The gambling-services company's chairman, president, vice
chairman, a director and vice president of marketing sold
405,300 shares May 31 and June 1, according to the filings.
The stock, which represented between 5% and 20% of their
holdings, fetched an average of $6.12 a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On June 13, the New York Daily News reported that Rep.
Bart Gordon (D.,Tenn.) was calling for a federal
investigation of the telephone-games business, which Players
had entered earlier in the month with a version of the
"Jeopardy" TV game show. According to the report, Rep. Gordon
said phone games might constitute gambling.
   Players stock, which had risen to a 52-week high of $8.50
a share after the company began test-marketing the game June
4, fell 28% in the two days following the report. It closed
yesterday in over-the-counter trading at $5.25, off 25 cents.
   Players Vice Chairman David Fishman, who sold 86,400
shares, said that the insiders sold their shares before
starting "Jeopardy" so that "no one could question our
intentions." As for the later stock drop, he asks, "How would
we know it was going to happen?"
   Four of the insiders at the Calabasas, Calif., company
also filed with the SEC on May 31 their intention to sell
more than a million additional shares "as soon as possible."
But Mr. Fishman said the filings were made in error, and that
there aren't any plans to sell any more stock.
   A spokesman for Rep. Gordon said the congressman wrote to
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh requesting an investigation
and that, late last week, the attorney general's office
responded that the matter has been referred to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.
   Players' Mr. Fishman said its telephone "Jeopardy" game
"is well within the {Federal Communications Commission}
guidelines of not being gambling" because of the way it is
structured, and because it involves skill, not chance.
   To play the "Jeopardy" game, contestants call a 900-number
and answer 11 increasingly more difficult questions by
spelling out the first two letters of the answer on a
Touch-Tone phone. The game costs about $1 per minute to play
and offers a monthly grand prize of $10,000; there are also
smaller daily prizes.
   The game is a new business for Players International. The
company gets most of its revenue from its Players Club, which
offers members discounts on casino hotel rooms, meals and
shows.

   CAPITOL GAINS: Former President Gerald R. Ford sold a
third of his holdings in Nova Pharmaceutical Corp. last
month, SEC filings show. Mr. Ford, who serves as a director
of the Baltimore-based drug-research concern, received
$20,650, or $4.13 a share, for the 5,000 shares.
   Mr. Ford said he sold the stock "purely, totally for
income-tax-paying purposes." The former president said he
acquired the Nova shares through the exercise of options at a
price above the stock's current share price, creating "a
tax-loss benefit" upon their sale. He said he can use that
benefit to offset capital gains earned so far this year in
other transactions.
   "I'm keeping 10,000 {Nova} shares because I have great
faith in the company," Mr. Ford added.
   Separately, SEC filings also show that Nova
Pharmaceutical's president, Hans Mueller, bought 1,500 of its
shares on the open market, at an average price of $3.94 a
share, May 24 and May 25. The purchases increased his total
holdings 4%. He was in Europe and couldn't be reached for
comment.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Nova closed at
$4.125, off 12.5 cents.

   CANADIAN MILLIONAIRE: In the largest insider sale reported
to the SEC last week, Michael G. Degroote, a director of
Canadian Pacific Ltd., sold 134.3 million Canadian dollars
(US$115.6 million) of its stock on June 21. He received C$22
(US$18.93) a share, the filings show. Canadian Pacific is a
Montreal-based holding company for a variety of
transportation, oil and gas, forestry and real estate
businesses.
   Mr. Degroote, who is chairman and chief executive officer
of another Canadian concern, Laidlaw Inc., sold 6,104,167 of
the shares he held indirectly in Canadian Pacific and kept
2,000 shares, according to SEC filings. Mr. Degroote acquired
the shares in 1988 when he sold a controlling interest in
Laidlaw to Canadian Pacific. He couldn't be reached for
comment.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Canadian Pacific
shares closed yesterday at $17.75, up 25 cents.
   ---
   SMALL CHANGE: Henry W. Bloch, chairman of H &amp; R Block
Inc., received $3 million for just 2% of his stake in the
Kansas City, Mo.-based tax-preparation and business-services
company. He sold 76,000 shares at an average price of $39.53
a share in sales June 21 and June 22, SEC filings show. Mr.
Bloch declined to comment.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, H &amp; R Block shares
finished at $41.50, off 87.5 cents.

   FORT WORTH, Texas -- You won't find its fashions on the
racks of Bloomingdale's or Saks Fifth Avenue, but Vera Lee
Garment Co. makes clothes you'd just die to wear.
   Literally.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Founded in 1932, Vera Lee is one of the nation's oldest
producers of what it tactfully calls "premade funeral
fashions." In other words, clothes for dead people.
   Operating out of a small yellow building in a residential
neighborhood here, the company makes about 125 styles of
burial apparel, ranging from frilly nightgowns and dresses
($37 to $100 wholesale) to sober business suits ($75 to $80).
   And despite the gloom hanging over parts of the fashion
industry this season, business for Vera Lee is, well, lively.
   In 1989, the company sold about 400 dresses a week,
racking up total sales of about $1 million for the year.
Profit rose, says a Vera Lee accountant, although he wouldn't
elaborate. And owner Kathye Kellow says the company intends
to expand into new areas of the country this year and add
five or six salespeople.
   Why would anybody buy a Vera Lee original for a loved
one's eternal rest, instead of, say, a favorite old dress or
suit? Most people are buried in their own clothes, says Ms.
Kellow, but others have been in nursing homes for years and
don't have any dress-up clothes left. Buying a new outfit
also saves family members from a painful search through the
deceased's closet, she adds.
   Good marketing helps, too. Some funeral homes display Vera
Lee styles side by side with matching caskets. "A lot of
times a family will just walk up and see a dress and say,
`That's mom,'" says Ms. Kellow.
   For obvious reasons, this branch of the apparel industry
operates with its own set of rules. Fashion, for example,
takes a back seat to practicality. Suit pockets and zippers
are fake, and waists are elastic so that one size fits most.
Dresses are fitted with Velcro fastenings down the back.
   Pastels and lighter colors are recommended for women, Ms.
Kellow adds. Men are generally attired in conservative navy
or brown suits, available with or without pin stripes.
   "In the '70s, we made a leisure burial suit because
leisure suits were so cool back then," Ms. Kellow recalls.
"But we can't get too fashion conscious because they're out
the next year."
   Not that anybody would notice.

   Big Stocks Falter
   After 1989 Run-Up

   NEW YORK -- Money managers slightly outperformed the
overall stock market in the first half, with managers
specializing in growth and small stocks leading the pack.
   The stock portfolios of investment managers gained an
average of 3.1% in the first six months of this year,
according to performance figures compiled by CDA Investment
Technologies Inc., Rockville, Md. Before subtracting fees,
the first-half results were a tad ahead of the 3% gain for
the overall market as measured by the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   All of the first-half gains came in the second quarter;
the average manager's portfolio sustained a loss of 3.2% in
the first quarter, according to CDA's calculations. The S&amp;P
index fell 3% in the first three months.
   For the 12 months ended June 30, stock managers posted a
gain of 13.7%, according to CDA's calculations, compared with
16.4% for the S&amp;P 500.
   Extending a trend begun last year, growth and small-stock
managers have taken the spotlight in the recent performance
rankings, far outshining investment advisers who favor the
big stocks that dominate the S&amp;P 500. The run-up in big
stocks began to flag last year, when both the takeover boom
and earnings increases among the large-capitalization issues
started to turn soft.
   Says growth-stock manager John Sullivan: "Since mid-1989,
it has been a growth-stock market, and we have been in the
right pew." He's a partner in Harris, Bretall, Sullivan &amp;
Smith in San Francisco, which was one of the top-performing
money-management firms in the first half.
   Mr. Sullivan, whose firm manages about $350 million of
stocks, says he and his partners have had little trouble
coming up with a portfolio of 40 well-known stocks, each with
earnings growing in the area of 20% a year. The firm makes
big bets on stock groups it thinks will do well, even at the
expense of diversity.
   So Harris Bretall has 32% of its portfolio in technology
stocks such as Compaq Computer Corp., Automatic Data
Processing Inc., Intel Corp., Motorola Inc., Novell Inc.,
Oracle Systems Corp. and Microsoft Inc. It also considers
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. a technology holding.
   Another 30% of the portfolio consists of a hodgepodge of
capital equipment, environmental and other industrial
concerns. Here the firm likes Browning-Ferris Industries
Inc., Waste Management Inc. and even one aerospace maker,
Boeing Co. In the drug area, with a 15% allocation, holdings
include Merck &amp; Co., Upjohn Co., Abbott Laboratories and St.
Jude Medical Inc.
   Harris Bretall has stayed fully invested in stocks and,
despite skeptics, thinks the corporate earnings picture is
getting brighter. "I suspect you're seeing the trough in
earnings," says Mr. Sullivan. "They're going to look better
in the third and fourth quarters and into 1991," he says.
   Provident Investment Counsel, Pasadena, Calif., another
top-performing growth manager with about $3.6 billion in
stocks under management, says companies with strong earnings
momentum could benefit even in a softening economy. "In that
kind of an environment, {investment} money seeks a place that
it can count on as a haven," bolstering growth stocks, says
Robert Kommerstad, Provident's chairman.
   Among Provident's strong performers are Walt Disney Co.,
Reuters PLC, Toys "R" Us Inc., Costco Wholesale Corp. and
that favorite growth stock, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ("You must
have heard that 1,000 times from growth managers," Mr.
Kommerstad says of Wal-Mart.) Software makers Microsoft Corp.
and Autodesk Inc. also are favorites.
   The turnaround in growth stocks is helping growth managers
land much of the new money entering the stock market, he
says. "You're starting to see a seminar here and there on
growth-stock investing," according to Mr. Kommerstad. "You
haven't seen that for years."
   George Yeager, head of New York-based Yeager, Wood &amp;
Marshall, another top-performing growth manager with nearly
$500 million in assets, says strong growth issues such as
Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola Co., McDonald's Corp. and Disney "are not
dependent on the business cycle" for much of their
performance.
   Mr. Yeager says the stocks he holds carry a price-earnings
multiple 1.3 times that of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index.
But their earnings are growing four times as fast as the S&amp;P
stocks. "That's just about the best trade-off in our
professional experience, and it's going to be good for quite
some time," he says.
   Some managers specializing in small stocks also did well
in the first half.
   Amerindo U.S. Advisors Inc. of Larkspur, Calif., which
buys nothing but electronic and biotechnology stocks at their
initial public offerings and sells them when they reach
annual sales of $300 million, topped the list of managers
during the period, as it did in the first quarter. The firm
has about $450 million under management.
   Amerindo's latest newsletter is bullish on the market,
saying it looks for a "spectacular third-leg in an extended
run that ought to carry over into the early 1990s."
Specifically, it predicts the Dow Jones Industrial Average
will break out of the "2500-2800 trading mode that it has
been in since last July by moving up to the 2700-3000 trading
area, before ultimately breaking out again on the upside."
   Amerindo recommends "aggressive" buying of stocks such as
Sequent Computer Systems Inc., Cisco Systems Inc., Chiron
Corp. and Amgen Inc.
   "In the first six months, earnings drove the market, and
that favored our stocks," says William Jeffery of Wall Street
Associates Inc., another manager specializing in small
stocks. The firm, based in La Jolla, Calif., with about $400
million under management. Like Amerindo, Wall Street
Associates greatly outperformed one measure of small stocks,
the Russell 2000, which rose 0.48% in the first half.
   Mr. Jeffery says there is an "ample supply" of stocks with
market capitalization under $400 million and superior
earnings growth. "They probably will be able to survive an
economic slowdown better than their bigger brethren, simply
because they are more focused and have niches in the market,"
he says.
   Among Mr. Jeffery's favorites: Software Toolworks Inc.,
Conner Peripherals Inc., Cirrus Logic Inc. and Wholesale Club
Inc.
   CDA compiles performance data based on reports that money
managers are required to file quarterly with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Because of gaps in the filings, the
data aren't precise. They assume, for example, that the stock
holdings remain in the managers' portfolios for the entire
quarter. Cash holdings, bonds, convertible securities,
foreign issues and short sales aren't included.
   Returns also haven't been reduced to reflect the managers'
fees. In addition, the various levels of risk that the
managers took to achieve their results aren't considered.

of more than $10 million for the six months ended June 30 as

   NEW YORK -- Citicorp, responding to insurance industry
efforts to prevent it from using a Delaware subsidiary to
sell insurance, told the Federal Reserve that there aren't
any legal grounds to prohibit it from taking advantage of a
recently enacted Delaware law.
   Since the passage of the legislation giving
state-chartered banks insurance powers, Citicorp has been
preparing to underwrite and sell insurance through its
state-chartered unit, Citibank Delaware.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a memo to the Fed, the nation's largest banking company
said federal banking regulations allow state-chartered
subsidiaries of banks to engage in any activities in which
state-chartered banks themselves can engage.
   The insurance industry has argued that the Delaware law
permits banks to circumvent federal regulations that prohibit
banks from selling and underwriting insurance.

   WASHINGTON -- In searching for someone to care for her
three children, Bonnie Fay of Alexandria, Va., turned to
Mother's Helper Agency, which billed itself in national
advertising as "serving America's most prestigious families."
But the nanny sent by the agency turned out to be something
less than Mary Poppins.
   Ms. Fay says she found marijuana in the room of the woman
she hired three years ago as a live-in nanny. And she fired
the woman after she admitted stealing money from Ms. Fay to
silence a boyfriend who threatened to tell the nanny's
parents about a past abortion. Mother's Helper then demanded
an additional $100 to find a replacement nanny, Ms. Fay says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agency says it doesn't know whether Ms. Fay's
allegations are true, and it asked for the extra fee because
the 60-day replacement period was past. Ms. Fay sued the
agency and won a judgment of $1,323 for costs incurred,
including fees paid to the agency. Her advice to other
working parents: consumer beware.
   In a nation of ever more two-paycheck couples, nannies
have become a hot commodity. Agencies have sprung up to
supply them for fees of $400 to $2,500. Many of the agencies
do a conscientious job. But some dissatisfied customers tell
of unchecked references, deficient screening, broken
contracts and unrefunded fees.
   James Rock and Sue Nelson turned to Helping Hands of
Potomac, Md., for a nanny last year, and the one the agency
sent seemed ideal. She had worked for the family of former
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, among others. Ms. Nelson
says she and her husband were further impressed when the
agency told them that "friends of the Carluccis wanted to
hire her."
   So the couple hired the nanny for $265 a week, plus health
benefits, her own two-bedroom basement apartment and use of a
car. Mr. Rock, a tax lobbyist, and Ms. Nelson, a staffer on
the Senate Budget Committee, say that about two months later
they were horrified to find purple bruises across their
two-year-old son's buttocks while bathing him one night. At
an emergency room, a physician concluded the boy had "been
hit repeatedly with a long flat stick," recalls Ms. Nelson.
The nanny denied harming the child, but left the next
morning.
   As they later learned, Mr. Carlucci's wife, Marcia, says
Helping Hands never called her about the nanny. Her reference
wouldn't have been glowing. "She was, among other things,
very, very lazy," says Mrs. Carlucci, who also recalls that
the nanny had had two accidents with the family's car.
   Stephanie Hecht, president of Jasah Inc., which does
business as Helping Hands, insists she had checked the
nanny's references. But she says she can't remember whether
she spoke to the Carluccis. Ms. Nelson and Mr. Rock never
accused the nanny of beating the child; the couple said they
had no proof. But they charged the agency with inadequate
screening and demanded a refund.
   When they couldn't get their money back, Ms. Nelson and
Mr. Rock took their dispute to court. They won a default
judgment earlier this year after the agency failed to contest
the claim. They recently got a check for $500 from Helping
Hands.
   Nationally, there are some 500 placement agencies for
nannies. Washington, D.C., home to the highest percentage of
working women among major cities, has a high concentration of
such agencies. Many nannies referred by them are young women
with child-care experience but little formal training,
recruited from towns in the West or Midwest. Weekly salaries
range from about $150 to $450 or more in costly areas such as
New York, plus room and board. Some even get health
insurance, paid vacations and holidays, and the use of a car.
   For a look at the kinds of complaints that can arise,
consider those lodged against Capable Care Agency, which
until last year was called Mother's Helper Agency. Over the
past three years, more than a dozen complaints have been
filed with the Washington Office of Consumer and Regulatory
Affairs, the small-claims branch of the District of Columbia
Superior Court, and the local Better Business Bureau. The
complaints typically involve screening problems or disputes
over refunds or replacements. Most of the complaints have
been resolved.
   Marla Sanders, a co-owner of Capable Care, based in
Washington, with a branch in Philadelphia, says the agency
may appear to have more problems than others because it does
a greater volume of business. (Ms. Sanders also owns a
nanny-placement agency in Beverly Hills, Calif., which
retains the name Mother's Helper.)
   Ms. Sanders calculates that the Washington agency has
placed 2,400 nannies since 1985. "It's a very good agency,"
she says. "I certainly don't invite these things to happen,
and I feel very bad when they happen." Ms. Sanders, a single
mother, says she started the business, which now has nine
full-time employees, after a bad experience with an agency
herself.
   Capable Care bills itself as "nationally known for quality
child care" and entreats parents to "maximize your child's
prime learning years with important help in language and
social development." It's a pitch that attracts many.
   John and Sally Wilhelm chose Capable Care over other
agencies when searching for someone to care for their
two-year-old son last year. From three referrals, the couple
chose a young woman from Utah who noted on her application
that she preferred to work with children aged two and older.
The agency described her as "quiet, calm and well-balanced,"
the Wilhelms say.
   They paid the agency $1,000 in registration and placement
fees, and advanced the woman's $224 air fare. But she seemed
unhappy from the moment she arrived, the Wilhelms say. She
didn't seem comfortable handling a toddler. She would sit
anxiously at the bottom of the stairs, for instance, while
her charge napped in a second-floor bedroom. She suffered a
bout of intense crying several days after arriving and
finally quit, saying she didn't like working with toddlers,
the Wilhelms say.
   Mr. Wilhelm, who is a writer and television producer, says
a Capable Care official later acknowledged that the nanny's
application hadn't been updated for several years. The agency
refunded the couple's fee after several months of complaints.
   Ms. Sanders says that though the application hadn't been
updated as it should have been, the agency checked with the
nanny's most recent employer, whom she had left only three
months earlier. Ms. Sanders says the family gave her a "very
good reference." The nanny "just wasn't comfortable" with the
Wilhelms, Ms. Sanders says. She says the agency refunded the
fee after offering replacements.
   Ms. Sanders and other agency owners say that matching
nannies to families is a delicate process. Sometimes,
personalities just don't mesh. Often, too, nannies who come
from small towns get homesick and have adjustment problems in
big cities.
   Capable Care says it screens carefully. It asks for three
child-care references and one character reference, interviews
the nanny's own family and reviews her work history, says Ms.
Sanders. Criminal and driver's records are checked in the
nanny's state of current residence, though the agency usually
must rely on the nanny herself to supply any criminal
records. The agency also asks applicants to fill out medical
and psychological questionnaires.
   Most applicants are interviewed only by telephone before
being referred to families. If, after 20 days, a nanny
doesn't work out, the agency says it offers to refund half
the referral fee. The agency says it offers to refer names of
a replacement if problems develop in the nanny's first 60
days, or up to six months if the family pays a higher fee.
   Ms. Sanders says her repeat business and customer
referrals speak of customer satisfaction. "They have always
been very cooperative with me," says Christine Mroczek, a
Falls Church, Va., health administrator, who says she
employed three nannies through the agency; she praised both
the agency's screening capabilities and the nannies she
hired. Jeanne Tannebaum, a Washington critical-care nurse,
says the agency honored her replacement guarantee even after
she exceeded the time limits.
   Inadequate screening can have tragic results. The National
Academy of Nannies Inc., a Denver training school, settled
out of court last year a lawsuit involving the referral of a
live-in nanny who gave a prescription anti-depressant drug,
apparently to stop an eight-month-old from crying; the boy
nearly died. After the 1985 incident, Denise Reich, the boy's
mother, learned the nanny had a lengthy medical file
detailing a history of violence, mental disorders and drug
abuse. Mrs. Reich and Terri Eurich, president of the Academy,
won't comment on the case.
   The International Nanny Association, a national advocacy
group for nannies, agencies and child-care educators, is
pushing for national standards and training credentials for
care-givers. At a recent convention the group's board passed
standards that member agencies must meet, including requiring
them to check nannies' references. Nanny training programs
that are members of the group also must meet standards
requiring certain levels of competency from their graduates.
   A good agency undertakes a comprehensive screening program
that goes further than checking references, looking into
criminal and driving records and requiring applicants to
complete a medical history questionnaire, says Bonnie Roeder,
an agency owner who heads the ethics committee for the nanny
association.
   In their defense, agencies say families themselves
sometimes mistreat nannies. They point to cases where parents
try to slip out of contracts, don't bother checking
references on their own, or overload nannies with work. But
Ms. Roeder also concedes that "there are some real pockets in
this industry that I would like to see we get rid of because
it affects the rest of us who are trying to do a good job."

   In your May 23 Mount Graham editorial "A Species of
Extremism" you said, "no one has shown persuasively that the
project would harm the squirrel." For the record: All state,
federal and University of Arizona biologists who prepared the
official biological documentation have opposed it. Fish and
Wildlife Service biologists, under oath, testified against
it. Scientists nationwide have signed petitions opposing it.
University of Arizona biologists risked tenure and signed.
Max Planck and Ohio State scientists oppose their own
institutions' participation.
   You also stated: "Telescope backers promise to reforest
the logged areas." For the record, government biologists say
it takes 200 years to create the old-growth forest the
squirrel requires. It should be noted that only the
University of Arizona would be allowed to cut trees in
"critical habitat," having obtained congressional exemption
from all our environmental laws. Do you suggest we spend
millions of taxpayer dollars on a captive-breeding program so
the astronomers can destroy the squirrels' homes and food
supply?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   You said the project requires 26 acres, but that is only
the project "footprint." The government says the project
would destroy some 130 acres of squirrel habitat -- mostly
within the mountaintop's ecologically priceless 600-acre
virgin spruce-fir forest.
   What you did not say is that there are other places (New
Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, South America, etc.) for
advanced design telescopes that do not destroy endangered
species or irreplaceable ecological treasures. Studies have
ruled Hawaii's Mauna Kea far superior. Mount Graham was
listed in a recent study as 37th worst of 58 sites in the
Western U.S. Is a Univerity of Arizona astronomer's driving
convenience reason to trash our environmental laws?
   Jobs lost is pure hokum. There are institutions dying to
steal the University of Arizona's collaborators. Jobs follow
the collaborators.
   Regarding your disavowal of subspecies that "are found
elsewhere, have many subspecies or can be relocated" -- by
that definition you demean human races, preclude plant
varieties for lifesaving drugs and miracle grains, and ensure
a barren North America without grizzly bear, Florida panther
or Key deer since all the above are subspecies.

   Corporate Finance
   Head, Steps Down

   NEW YORK -- Citicorp's head of North American corporate
finance, George L. Davis, resigned in what appears to be the
first fallout from a shuffling of top officers in January.
   Mr. Davis, 55 years old, couldn't be reached for comment.
However, a memo from Chairman John S. Reed to policy
committee members said that "the business has changed
considerably from that envisioned in 1987," when Mr. Davis
rejoined the large banking company. Mr. Reed's memo added,
"George feels that he can make a greater contribution
elsewhere."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Davis had left Citicorp in 1981 to become executive
vice president at First Chicago Corp. under Chairman Barry
Sullivan.
   Mr. Davis's resignation, Citicorp executives said, isn't
related to the bank's rising levels of problem loans for
corporate takeovers and commercial real estate, two troubled
areas that Mr. Davis oversaw.
   Rather, a bank executive who asked not to be identified
linked the departure of Mr. Davis, who is noted for his
credit analysis skills, to a political setback suffered by
Vice Chairman Lawrence Small, his patron within Citicorp.
   The January reorganization diminished Mr. Small's
influence within Citicorp and, some executives said, hastened
Mr. Davis's departure. In that shake-up, the traditional
commercial and investment banking functions were merged, and
the resulting wholesale bank split into two groups -- one
managing the developed countries, consisting of North
America, Japan and Europe; and the other managing the
developing countries.
   As part of that shake-up, Mr. Small, who had run the
world-wide commercial bank, was placed in a lesser role as
the top liaison with corporate clients, and Richard S.
Braddock, head of consumer banking, was elevated to the
long-vacant presidency.
   Mr. Small, a hard-charging, ambitious executive, was
considered by some the leading contender for the president's
job. However, Citicorp executives said disagreements grew
between Messrs. Reed and Small, especially over the tough
bargaining stance advocated by Mr. Small toward debt
negotiations with Brazil and other Latin American borrowers.
   At the time of the reorganization, Mr. Reed and other
Citicorp executives -- as well as Mr. Small himself --
insisted Mr. Small hadn't lost out. "With the age difference
of only two years between John and myself, I've never thought
that it was particularly logical for me to aspire to be chief
executive officer," Mr. Small said at the time.
   Michael A. Callen, who had been sector executive for
investment banking, was put in charge of wholesale banking in
the developed countries. Citicorp executives speculated that
Mr. Callen wants to fill key posts, such as Mr. Davis's
position, with personnel loyal to him.
   Mr. Callen was traveling yesterday and couldn't be
reached.

   Sundstrand to Wrap
   5-Month Brazil Data

   ROCKFORD, Ill. -- Sundstrand Corp. said it will
"accelerate" the financial reporting of its Brazilian
operation, wrapping five months' results from the financially
pressed unit into the second quarter.
   Like those of many other companies, Sundstrand's operation
in Brazil has been hit hard by effects of a stringent
government-imposed anti-inflation plan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company's accounting move will consolidate the bulk of
the worst fiscal news from Brazil into one quarter, and may
also lessen misgivings investors have shown toward Sundstrand
stock because of the company's Brazilian exposure.
   In April, the maker of aerospace and industrial equipment
said second-quarter earnings would be reduced by $2 million
to $3 million as a result of its problems in Brazil. But
yesterday, the company announced that it expects losses at
the Brazilian unit will lower overall net by about $7
million.
   In the year-ago second period, Sundstrand's net-boosted by
a $10.3 million gain from sale of a division -- was $37.9
million, or 94 cents a share, on sales of $394.3 million.
   Sundstrand has historically consolidated the results from
Sundstrand do Brazil on a three-month lag basis, with the
earnings from the quarter ended in December appearing, for
example, in the parent's firstquarter earnings.
   "Given the current economic situation in Brazil,"
Sundstrand said it would be "more informative to its
shareholders if (the company) reduces this financial
reporting lag to one month."
   Brazil's wrenching economic program is pinching a host of
U.S. companies who operate there: Last month, the stock of
Caterpillar Inc. went into a tailspin from which it hasn't
yet recovered, after the heavy-equipment maker disclosed
bigger-than-anticipated problems in the region. Other
companies feeling earnings pressure from Brazil include
Allied-Signal Inc., Armco Inc. and Whirlpool Corp.

   A Carbon Tax Could Blacken Economy

   Now that President Bush has opened the door for "tax
revenue increases," a curious alliance is emerging between
environmentalists and gasoline users that could speed passage
of a broad-based tax on the production of carbon dioxide.
Early estimates are that such a tax could raise at least $30
billion during its first five years. But while a carbon tax
sounds good in theory, practice might be another story.
   Recent converts to free-market principles, such as the
National Wildlife Federation, support a carbon tax as a fix
to the global warming problem that would work far more
smoothly than complex command-and-control regulations on
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Auto makers,
truckers and other industries heavily dependent on cheap
transportation fuels see the tax as a way to short-circuit a
gasoline tax increase, shifting the burden to other
industries that also are major producers of carbon dioxide.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The White House has not taken a position on carbon taxes,
but the "troika" -- Chief of Staff John Sununu; Richard
Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget; and
Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers
-- is intrigued by such taxes. This year's Council of
Economic Advisers annual report, for example, devotes
considerable attention to the merits of market-tuned emission
taxes.
   Understandably, opponents of carbon taxes include the coal
and electric industries and the big energy producing and
consuming states. They fear that legislation introduced last
month by Rep. Fortney Stark (D., Calif.) could become an easy
vehicle by which the House Ways and Means Committee could
speed the tax through. They note that it wasn't until this
time last year that the notion of a chlorofluorocarbon tax
was introduced; six months later it had passed and gone into
effect.
   The Stark bill would tax coal at $15 a ton, petroleum at
$3.25 a barrel and natural gas at 40 cents per thousand cubic
feet. Unlike the very simple chlorofluorocarbon tax levied on
Du Pont and the small number of CFC producers, a carbon tax
would by its nature be broad-based and require a complex
allocation of responsibilities. If applied equitably, it
could be levied at the source -- the coal mine, for example
-- and on the end-user.
   Among the drawbacks of a carbon tax:
   -- It would fall more heavily on some parts of the country
than others. Western coal- and oil-producing regions and
Midwestern coal-burning regions would both be hit hard.
   -- Domestic coal, which supplies 60% of America's
electricity and will be even more crucial in the future
unless nuclear power is revived, would be hit
disproportionately hard if a tax is levied that does not
consider environmental-control technologies that alter actual
emissions. Coal exports could be mortally wounded.
   -- A carbon tax could inadvertently encourage more imports
of oil. Swapping part of the budget deficit for a larger
trade deficit may not be prudent policy.
   -- A U.S.-only tax could further reduce American
competitiveness.
   -- Many utilities are scampering to finance billions of
dollars in upgrades to meet the acid-rain provisions of the
Clean Air Act legislation that Congress is expected to
finally pass this fall. These same utilities would be the
most likely candidates to pay a hefty carbon tax.
   -- A carbon tax -- if not set at the right level, tied to
changing energy prices and to capital costs -- might not lead
to significant carbon dioxide cuts if industry decided it was
cheaper to pay a tax than to clean up older plants. Instead
of encouraging energy efficiency, it could bias the energy
industry against new capital investments.
   -- While a carbon tax might reduce overall carbon dioxide
emissions, it would not provide crucial incentives for the
U.S. and other nations to engage in reforestation and other
environmental goals.
   -- Carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas. A
meaningful first response to global climate change is to
develop a greenhouse-gas index that compares the impacts of
various gases on the environment and allows countries to
establish their own priorities among the various greenhouse
gases -- including CFCs, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous
oxide.
   -- Finally, before Congress and the administration move
any farther down the carbon-tax path, they must earmark the
revenue for environmental and energy projects. More likely,
the revenue would go for increased government spending in
other areas.
   A carefully constructed strategy makes sense once we know
more about global warming and the pacing of necessary
actions. And a carefully constructed increase in taxes also
makes sense. It could be devastating to the U.S., however, to
get carried away by a naive belief that fixing the deficit
and the environment is only a matter of working out a few
mechanical details at some late-night congressional
conference.

   TOKYO -- Sales of imported cars, trucks and buses in Japan
climbed 25% to set a monthly record for June of 22,253 units
from 17,840 units a year earlier, the Japan Automobile
Importers' Association said.
   Statistics show sales of imported, foreign motor vehicles
topped year-earlier levels for the 78th month in a row.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales for the first six months of this year set a record
of 113,622 units, representing a 40% gain from 81,318 units
in the first half of 1989.
   The association said booming personal consumption was
behind the strong gain, as Japan's economy continues to
expand for the 43rd month in a row.
   The strong increase from year-earlier levels was traced in
part to a Japanese consumption tax imposed in April, 1989,
which replaced a higher commodity tax. The price gap between
Japanese cars and imported cars also has narrowed as Japanese
auto makers have unveiled more expensive models.
   By country, in all imported vehicle categories, West
Germany was the source of 13,531 units, up 16% from 11,708
units. The trend of rising sales of West German cars since
the introduction of a consumption tax is not likely to
change, despite an average price rise of 3% for West German
models in the domestic market.
   Sales of all U.S.-made vehicles grew 28% in June to 2,898
units from 2,258 units. Sales of all British vehicles
registered a 67% upsurge to 2,230 units in June from 1,338
units.
   French car sales showed a 43% jump, totaling 1,520 units,
while Swedish sales registered a 29% increase to 1,305 units.

   For the six months, net income should increase to roughly
$3.4 million, or 32 cents a share, compared with $2 million,
or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to about
$51.3 million from $37.9 million.

   Would a new tax on securities trading send the stock
market for a loop?
   Many traders, securities-industry executives and academics
believe that a federal tax on securities sales, like that now
being considered by the Bush administration, would probably
trigger an initial slump in stock prices and volume.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the longer-term effects on trading and capital raising
might not be as dire as Wall Street is predicting. Indeed,
the idea of a trading tax drew support from some corporate
leaders and academic experts.
   "There has been too much money made in speculation and
churning and . . . program trading, which does nothing for
America," said Eli Broad, chairman of Broad Inc. and home
builder Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp. in Los Angeles. "It's high
time these activities be taxed," said Mr. Broad, who added,
however, that he opposes taxation on long-term investments.
   This newspaper disclosed yesterday that the so-called
securities transfer excise tax is getting serious
consideration in the White House as a way to raise taxes on
the rich.
   Word of the proposed tax drew immediate protest on Wall
Street. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. denounced such a move as
"extremely harmful to the nation's economic health." Other
critics are predicting sharp declines in the markets should
the tax be enacted.
   One prominent finance professor, Sanford J. Grossman of
the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, warned: "The
Bush administration is toying with another crash."
   Indeed, traders blamed part of yesterday's 32.42-point
drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the biggest decline
in two weeks, on jitters over the possible new tax.
   "We're taking it damned seriously," said Stephen Bell, a
lobbyist for Salomon Brothers Inc., a big Wall Street
securities firm. A similar tax was proposed in 1987, and
died. But, "unlike a couple of years ago when it was opposed
fervently in the White House, we're not sure it's opposed
now," Mr. Bell said.
   If the tax is enacted, all investors, including
individuals, corporations and pension funds, would have to
pay a levy on sales of stocks, bonds, futures contracts and
other instruments. That levy could be as high as 0.5%,
although congressional aides said yesterday that a 0.15% levy
is more likely. That would be enough to raise $27 billion
over five years.
   Any actual tax could be levied at a fixed rate, but also
could be variable, based on who was doing the trading and how
long they held a security.
   But would the tax really matter to corporations looking to
raise capital, aside from the initial expected decline in the
stock market?
   Perhaps not. Many major countries already have securities
transfer taxes in place, including Belgium, Denmark, France,
Portugal, Spain, Italy, Japan, West Germany, Britain and
Canada. "Their economies appear not to have suffered from the
tax, which contributes significantly to their tax receipts,"
says a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
   Even Wall Streeters who are against the tax see how it
could eventually be digested by the markets -- albeit at
small investors' expense.
   Peter Da Puzzo, co-head of world-wide equity operations at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said that after the initial
price declines, the stock market would simply have to live
with the higher costs. The problem, he said, is that the cost
of the tax would likely be passed on to small investors,
partly through the pension funds that would be paying more to
trade. (Pension funds last year accounted for 25% of all
stock transactions, by some estimates.)
   Brokerage firms would also suffer, Mr. Da Puzzo said. "It
does hurt the securities industry, which right now is coming
out of a bit of difficult times. Now you're going to increase
our costs."
   But some experts think a trading tax would help the
securities markets by imposing a financial penalty on those
who trade too much, like computer-aided program traders. The
transaction tax "would take the froth off" the securities
markets, said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard University
economics professor. "At the margin it would have no effect
on long-term investments, but it is very expensive on the
in-again-out-again guy."
   Mr. Summers said the tax "would tend to fall on
destabilizing strategies" such as portfolio insurance,
stock-index arbitrage and extensive use of stop-loss
strategies and momentum-based commodity market strategies.
   After the 1987 stock-market crash, some experts argued
that it would be helpful if the markets were slowed down
through a transaction tax. "I believe there is a strong case
for throwing a little sand in the wheels," Yale University
professor James Tobin has said.
   President Bush already is on record as favoring some type
of securities tax. In the administration's fiscal 1991
budget, released in January, Mr. Bush proposed an
11-cents-a-trade transaction tax on commodity trades and a
small levy on over-the-counter stocks that would expand a fee
charged on exchange-listed stocks.
   The administration's new proposal, which two weeks ago was
merely one of about 20 revenue-generating ideas being kicked
around in the heat of the budget summit, now has picked up
speed.
   Administration and congressional negotiators are looking
to raise $25 billion or more of revenue a year. "I think that
two weeks ago, it was one of 20 proposals," said Bruce
Thompson Jr., the Washington lobbyist for Merrill Lynch.
"Last week all of a sudden it got on a very short list."
   The proposal appears to be supported by several top
administration officials. Budget Director Richard Darman
would back such a plan because it would appear to tax the
wealthy, several lobbyists said. Then he could offer that as
a sweetener to a cut of the capital-gains tax.
   The plan also may have the approval of Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, who has been an outspoken supporter of
creating incentives for investors to hold securities longer.
Since a transfer tax would penalize short-term holdings it
could help achieve that goal.
   Wall Street firms dispute the view that the new tax would
hit only the wealthy, noting that the tax would hit pension
funds. "It is instead a regressive tax on the savings and
retirement income of millions of Americans," Merrill Lynch
says in a full-page advertisement prepared for next Monday's
edition of Roll Call, a Washington newspaper. "This tax is a
terrible idea," the ad states.
   Edward O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry
Association, Wall Street's main trade group, said that even
if the tax proposal is merely a "trial balloon" being floated
by the White House, his group wants to puncture it.
   The securities group said that many of the countries that
currently have transaction taxes -- including Italy, Japan,
West Germany, Britain and Canada -- are taking steps to
reduce or eliminate their levies.
   A Securities and Exchange Commission official, who
declined to be named, said U.S. markets would surely lose
some business if the tax is enacted. "A lot of the
discretionary business done on the U.S. exchanges could be
done elsewhere," the official said.
   Although any new tax would likely apply to trades made by
Americans on foreign exchanges, U.S. traders might well find
ways around it. Mr. O'Brien, the securities association
president, conceded that traders will "try to avoid it in the
most efficient way they can."
   Hyman P. Minsky, a scholar at the Jerome Levy Economics
Institute, said it would be almost impossible for regulators
to stop trades from migrating overseas. "Are you going to put
an SEC man or a tax collector behind every terminal?" he
asked.
   The New York Stock Exchange, which has been already hurt
by a migration of trading business overseas, said only:
"There's no proposal on the table and it is premature to
comment until a proposal is made."
   Futures brokers in Chicago, meanwhile, are worried that a
transaction tax might stand a good chance in Washington
because of the futures industry's soiled reputation over
recent trading scandals. Robert Anderson, president of Des
Moines, Iowa-based Farmers Grain &amp; Livestock Corp., said the
futures industry already pays extra fees that securities
traders don't. "Everybody is against having their ox gored,"
Mr. Anderson said. "But futures are a pretty easy whipping
boy."
   One of the loudest opponents of the proposed tax yesterday
was the Chicago Board of Trade, the nation's largest
commodities exchange. "George Bush has gone from `no new
taxes' to `total new taxes.'" said Thomas R. Donovan, Board
of Trade president. "This administration is looking for the
American financial markets to bail out the savings and loans
fiasco, and with this proposal, they will compound their
error in judgment."

   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. cut ratings on the
debt of three Finnish banks, reflecting an increasingly
deregulated and competitive operating environment.
   The three banks "have some common problems," each with its
own particular difficulties, "but it all comes out of the
deregulated and competitive market," said Virginia L. Manzer,
an analyst at S&amp;P.

   The credit-rating company cut the senior unsecured debt of
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki to double-A-minus from double-A. The
bank's subordinated debt falls to single-A-plus from
double-A-minus. A total of $3 billion of securities are
affected.
   S&amp;P cut Union Bank of Finland Ltd.'s $1.6 billion of
senior unsecured debt to double-A-minus from double-A. And
Postipankki Ltd.'s $415 million of senior unsecured
obligations dated Jan. 1, 1988, and later fell to
double-A-plus from triple-A.

   BUSH HOPES to boost Gorbachev with kind words at Western
summits.
   The White House worries because hardliners now accuse the
Soviet leader of "losing" Eastern Europe. To bolster him,
Bush pushes NATO to declare at the end of its London meeting
today that the West is scaling back militarily throughout
Europe. Western leaders also may send Baker or another high
official to brief Gorbachev this weekend, during the Soviet
party congress.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bush aides want next week's Houston summit of
industrialized nations to help Gorbachev -- without granting
the Soviets huge economic aid yet. The meeting could issue
the West's first broad statement of a willingness to help,
but Moscow would have to meet conditions before new aid
flows.
   Bush sympathizes with Gorbachev about conservatives'
attacks on him, cracking: "I know the feeling."
                                                                                                       

   REGULATORS WORK to quell criticism they are still too lax
in the thrift cleanup.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. readies an ambitious plan to
sell a huge chunk of real estate and other assets acquired
from insolvent institutions. Congress complains the agency
has moved too slowly, but the likely fire-sale prices may
enrage lawmakers. Meanwhile, regulators frustrate S&amp;L groups
by refusing to ease limits on loans to single developers as
much as S&amp;Ls wanted.
   Banks and S&amp;Ls are worried about a tough new government
policy of disclosing how much they lend in their own
communities. Consumer groups will use the records, which also
grade lending to low-income people, to challenge mergers.
"Think about how your report will look in the local
newspaper," a Fed official warns bankers.
                                                                                                       

   BUDGET NEGOTIATORS find deficit-cutting is tougher than
partisan posturing.
   Hopes diminish that Bush's about-face on taxes will
produce a quick accord. Officials remain far apart on how
deeply to cut defense and government benefits. But growing
turf battles suggest talks are getting serious; for instance,
Senate Finance Chairman Bentsen, who fears a higher gasoline
tax, demands that his committee shape any tax increase.
   To get the talks moving, Sen. Domenici and House Ways and
Means Chairman Rostenkowski discuss a bipartisan tax plan.
Both favor higher consumption taxes. Democrats press to raise
the top income-tax rate for wealthier taxpayers to 33% from
28%. But there is new talk of a "revenue-neutral" compromise:
a new 31% or 32% rate to replace the present 28% and 33%
brackets.
   Bush may face a choice between raising the top tax rate
and getting a significant deficit accord.
                                                                                                       

   SULLIVAN'S SLOWNESS discourages candidates for the NIH
director's job, scientists warn. The top research slot has
been vacant nearly a year. The human services chief recently
has interviewed some candidates, but after asking a panel how
to make the job more attractive, he hasn't acted on its
proposals to give the director more authority, independence
and pay.
                                                                                                       

   INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE? The Senate Banking Committee pushes
a bill calling on the CIA to keep track of foreign efforts to
make inroads into U.S. high-technology markets. Bush
administration free-traders oppose the idea. But with the
Soviet threat diminishing, some in the intelligence community
would welcome a new role.
                                                                                                       

   SUNUNU SWELTERS under criticism from Republican
conservatives. At Bush's behest, he shows GOP senators
compromise language on the job-discrimination bill, but the
lawmakers, already mad about Bush's tax flip-flop, claim he
caved in to liberals. The White House, which wants a bill
Bush can sign, says Sununu hadn't endorsed the proposal and
was just trying to do his job.
                                                                                                       

   BROADCASTERS GRAPPLE with how to handle inflammatory
commercials from fringe candidates. After airing an ad from
Georgia lieutenant gubernatorial candidate J.B. Stoner
declaring "Praise God for AIDS" and assailing blacks, Jews
and gays, one Atlanta TV station ran a disclaimer telling
viewers that federal law requires it to air the commercial
uncensored.
                                                                                                       

   DRUG WARS fade from the Washington political agenda. The
Drug Enforcement Administration begins to scale back
far-flung search-and-destroy operations in Peru and Bolivia.
The agency admits it failed to meet its goal of cutting
cocaine trafficking by 50%, but says the program helped raise
drug prices in some American cities. Critics say prices are
up because Colombian traffickers are cutting the cocaine
supply to raise profits.
   Bennett is less visible in his second year. He hasn't
halted interagency squabbling, and he feuds with Democrats,
who say he overemphasizes law enforcement and doesn't do
enough to help drug abusers get treatment. Creation of the
drug czar's post "hasn't made any difference," says Karst
Besteman, executive director of the Alcohol and Drug Problems
Association.
   Cocaine use among the middle class is leveling off, but
heroin imports surge, thanks partly to bumper poppy crops.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Presiding over the Senate, John Glenn, a
former Marine combat pilot, crisply announces that the Senate
will recess until "0830 hours." . . . A Dole staffer calls
the budget talks "Darman Poker: You sit at the table,
everybody antes, nobody wins and Darman gets all the cards."
. . . National Security Chief Scowcroft dodges a question in
a press briefing by saying: "That's a good question, and let
me state the problem more clearly without going too deeply
into the answer."

   Rare Document Field Sees Prices Spiral
   As a New Breed of Collector Signs On

   LOS ANGELES -- The Gallery of History, with its elegant
displays of rare documents signed by notables from John F.
Kennedy to Lou Gehrig, looks like a museum. Except, of
course, for the price tags.
   Here in a corner of the cavernous Beverly Center shopping
mall, customers can plunk down the plastic for a beautifully
mounted battlefield communication from Napoleon ($29,995).
Film fans can snap up a handsome frame containing signed
memorabilia from "Gone With the Wind" ($19,950). And cradled
in mahogany is the ultimate gift for an Americana buff:
Abraham Lincoln's famous letter to Grace Bedell, the young
girl who suggested he grow a beard to help win the
presidency.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Price? $1.25 million.
   Once no one would have dreamed that Honest Abe's mail
would be peddled in a mall store right next door to Banana
Republic, the safari-theme clothier. But these days,
manuscripts are hot commodities. Emancipated from dusty
vaults and archives, they are popping up on the shelves of
retailers eager to place them on living room and office walls
around the U.S. (Until the publicly traded Gallery of History
chain bought the Lincoln letter a few years ago from a
private collector, the prized manuscript had been kept in a
safety deposit box.)
   A new breed of document hounds, some with dollar signs in
their eyes, is flooding the field once dominated by a small
circle of scholars, dealers and private collectors. The
demand has sent prices spiraling.
   Inevitably, the old guard is squaring off against the new.
Old-line collectors say newcomers often treat pieces as
high-yield investments rather than irreplaceable historical
documents. They also warn that those jumping on the bandwagon
for profit may get burned by the vagaries of speculation in
the burgeoning market, overpricing based on fancy packaging
gimmicks, and even forgers.
   "If you want to invest in manuscripts, buy CDs and
Treasury notes," sniffs Dr. William Coleman, a philographer
for more than 35 years and past director of the Manuscript
Society, an august group of document hobbyists. Collectors
should buy because they appreciate the material, he argues,
not because they hope to make a killing.
   Others decry the trend toward framed documents being
retailed as art. "Serious collectors don't buy framed
material," says Dr. Norman Boas, a retired Mystic, Conn.,
physician who has collected Lincolnalia and other
presidential manuscripts for nearly half a century.
   Todd M. Axelrod, Gallery of History's founder, dismisses
the criticism as sour grapes. "I took the ball away from the
East Coast establishment," snaps Mr. Axelrod, who calls
documents "the last `collectible' of unique, one-of-a-kind
pieces that is still within the reach of the middle class."
Other Gallery sites include New York, Dallas, Washington and
its headquarters city, Las Vegas, Nev.
   Many collectors and dealers contend that Mr. Axelrod and
others selling framed documents charge inflated prices for
pieces that could be bought at auction for hundreds,
thousands, and occasionally even tens of thousands of dollars
less.
   "There's a place for these retail galleries if you're
investing in a piece of furniture," says Herman Darvick, a
Rockville Centre, N.Y., dealer and past president of the
Universal Autograph Collectors Club, whose membership is
considered a bit more casual than the Manuscript Society's.
"But don't buy it as an investment, because you're investing
in a frame." Selling pricey framed pieces as investments, he
says, gives document dealers "a bad name."
   A rare sketch of Mickey Mouse signed by Walt Disney,
mounted with the entrepreneur's photo and an explanatory
plaque, is priced at $79,995 at the Los Angeles Gallery of
History store. (Almost all of the store's pieces come with a
photograph or other piece of art and a plaque.) Mr. Darvick
says he sold a signed Mickey Mouse piece to Mr. Axelrod in
February for about $11,000. Mr. Axelrod, seated in his Las
Vegas office surrounded by rare documents, says he paid Mr.
Darvick more than that for the Disney work, and was unsure
whether the piece was the same one on display here.
   Mr. Axelrod concedes that consumers can buy unframed
manuscripts for less through auctions and other dealers, but
says his company offers an inventory of more than 100,000
documents -- one of the nation's largest private document
collections -- preserved to "Library of Congress standards."
The research and 10 year guarantee of authenticity, he says,
give the consumer a "measure of comfort" from dealing with an
established enterprise.
   Although splashy pieces tend to grab attention -- there's
a $33,000 Richard Nixon letter about Vietnam on display here,
along with a $55,000 display signed by all seven astronauts
from the ill-fated Challenger mission -- Mr. Axelrod says the
average purchase is between $2,000 and $3,000.
   In that price range, buyers can get well-known sports and
entertainment figures such as Jimmy Stewart, James Cagney and
Ty Cobb. Right now, some of the more popular historical
figures, whose documents often sell for much more, are Albert
Einstein and John F. Kennedy. Abraham Lincoln, a perennial
favorite, is also particularly hot at the moment.
   No one disputes that historical documents are often
undervalued when compared with art, coins and other
collectibles. "I find a lot of parallels to the stamp and
coin business," says Ira Goldberg, president of Superior
Stamp &amp; Coin Co., a Beverly Hills, Calif., auction house that
recently conducted the Manuscript Society's annual auction.
As investments, he says, "autographs are 25 years behind the
times." Many manuscripts by U.S. presidents, for example,
fetch only a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, as do
documents associated with notables such as Amelia Earhart,
Irving Berlin, Frank Lloyd Wright and Charles Lindbergh.
   Joseph Maddalena, a Beverly Hills dealer, contends that
clashes between older and newer collectors are inevitable as
their numbers swell from a few thousand to an estimated
100,000 within a few years, and prices for quality pieces
appreciate at double-digit rates.
   The presence of free-spending, well-financed collectors
such as late publisher Malcolm Forbes and industrialist
Armand Hammer has publicized the allure of old autographs.
Blue-chip document buffs have helped auction houses such as
Sotheby's, both in terms of strong prices for quality works
and in broadening the market. "There's more depth to the
market now," says Marsha Malinowski, senior cataloger for
European and American literary manuscripts. "Before, you
could count the heavy hitters on one hand."
   Document collectors must be on the lookout for fakes. At
the recent Manuscript Society auction in Los Angeles, a rare
letter supposedly written by religious leader Mary Baker Eddy
was withdrawn when it turned out to be the handiwork of
Joseph Cosey, a notoriously skillful American forger. (Cosey
forgeries are sought by some collectors who admire his
talent.)
   Kenneth W. Rendell, a Newton, Mass., document expert who
was hired by Newsweek magazine to examine the "Hitler
Diaries" in 1983 and who declared them forgeries, recommends
that consumers buy only from reputable dealers offering
unconditional lifetime authenticity guarantees. Be leery, he
adds, of those who offer 30-day guarantees and refuse to
publish prices. But Mr. Rendell says the fear of forgery
shouldn't keep prospective collectors out of the field.
"Fraud has to be kept in perspective," he says.
   There are other perils for the uninitiated, including
automated-pen signatures that perfectly reproduce the
signatures of busy politicians and celebrities, and public
relations firms and secretaries that routinely crank out
their employers' John Hancocks. Mr. Rendell and some other
dealers say they shy away from Hollywood memorabilia, along
with much of the work of modern presidents and most living
persons, for those reasons.
   As is true with other investments, says Mr. Darvick, the
Rockville Centre dealer: "If you shop for bargains, you're
going to get burned."

   "There were some economic plans proposed back in 1982 that
caused a furor something like we're hearing now. And the
president, in my view, did what was right."
   -- George Bush, June 29, 1990

   Haven't I seen this picture before? Wasn't it "Friday the
13th"? Of all of George Bush's answers at the worst press
conference of his presidency last Friday, the most depressing
was his reference to 1982. He meant the notorious "TEFRA" tax
act of that summer, the lowest moment of the Reagan
presidency until Iran-Contra. Does Mr. Bush really want to do
a summer sequel?
   The question matters, because for all the uproar over the
demise of the no-new-tax pledge, the budget summit isn't over
yet. What matters is the deal George Bush signs. But if TEFRA
is his historical guide, we should all start calculating our
lower take-home pay. That history is worth rehearsing lest it
be repeated.
   The $100 billion TEFRA tax hike was the Washington
community's first attempt to repeal Reaganomics. Mr. Reagan
signed onto it in the middle of recession (and amid much
Beltway gloating), but he overcame it later for two reasons.
First, TEFRA repealed only part of the much larger 1981
Reagan tax cut; when the tax cut's fiscal stimulus finally
hit in 1983, the economy boomed. Second, voters could accept
a modest U-turn from Ronald Reagan because his public
identity as a tax-cutter was already so strong. Mr. Bush has
neither Reagan card in reserve.
   Just how bad was TEFRA in 1982? Let us count the ways.
Though it was peddled as a deficit-reducer, the budget
deficit still soared -- to 6% of the economy in 1983.
Congress spent as ever. The $3 in promised spending cuts for
every $1 of tax increases never materialized.
   TEFRA also proved irrelevant to its other avowed purpose,
that of inducing the Federal Reserve to reduce interest
rates. In his exhaustive 1987 book on the Fed, journalist
(and no friend of Reaganomics) William Greider wrote that
"there was no real connection" between the tax deal and the
Fed's decision to ease. "The Fed had decided to ease interest
rates a full month before final passage of the tax bill was a
certainty," he wrote. Fed Chairman Paul Volcker had other
reasons to act: Trouble in Mexico and at Penn Square Bank
threatened the banking system, and the economy was already in
deep recession.
   As for politics, Republicans lost 26 House seats that
November. TEFRA didn't help. Larry Kudlow, the Bear Stearns
economist who worked at the White House at the time, recalls
simply that, "TEFRA was a disaster."
   Mr. Bush's aides now insist they've learned since then.
But there are signs that maybe they haven't learned enough --
Mr. Bush's Friday comments for one. Nicholas Brady, the
Treasury secretary, supported TEFRA while in the Senate in
1982 and has said privately that a budget deal is critical to
get the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates again. Yet
this Fed, as much as Paul Volcker's, has to its great credit
followed its own economic logic.
   "What worries me," says one GOP official with long
experience in Washington, "is that this has become a monetary
fishing expedition." TEFRA aside, the last administration to
try to trade fiscal austerity for monetary ease in this way
left office in 1981.
   Then there's Richard Darman, the crafty budget director
who was also present at TEFRA's creation. Mr. Darman is smart
enough to know the history, but he also badly wants a budget
deal so he can claim a successful tenure at OMB. Senior
officials worry that in the end Mr. Darman will give up any
serious reforms of the budget process if he can get major
cuts in entitlements (Medicare). Already, White House aides
say the line-item veto is off the table. At least the
capital-gains tax cut is still living, but other new taxes
will be offered to Democrats in exchange.
   George Bush has run a tactical presidency, tacking as the
political pressures shift. But even tacticians have their
moments of definition, and this is one. If he gets the con-
cessions he wants from Democrats, his tax reversal may be
forgiven. But Democrats, having won repeal of the tax pledge
at no cost to them, will not now cooperate easily. Their
demands will escalate to include the symbolic repeal of
Reaganomics, through an increase in the top marginal tax
rate.
   Painted into his tactical corner, Mr. Bush will have only
two options if Democrats don't budge. He can accept a phony
TEFRA-like deal that will be heralded by his enemies as
"statesmanship" but will in fact signal a great defeat. He
will gain Beltway applause without getting control over the
budget.
   Or he could reject a bad deal, and explain to voters that
he put everything on the table and still got no help from a
do-nothing Congress. He could blame Democrats for causing the
trauma of Gramm-Rudman's automatic budget cuts. Blood would
flow, but the betting here is that with his bully pulpit and
residual popularity, Mr. Bush would prevail. Of course, this
would require a political courage and public candor rarely
seen so far in the Bush White House.
   In changing his mind about lip-reading, Mr. Bush asks us
to remember Abraham Lincoln. But if Mr. Bush merely repeats
the debacle of 1982, a different presidential analogy will be
on voters' lips. That president grew up in Georgia, not
Illinois.

   EUROPEAN TV CONSORTIUM

   A group of 14 broadcasting and telecommunications concerns
from five European Community nations will launch next week a
consortium to promote high-definition television, familiarly
termed HDTV.
   The consortium, called Vision 1250, "will set up and
manage both fixed and mobile HDTV facilities to be made
available to TV and audio-visual professionals and
broadcasters in the European Community," the EC Commission
said. Vision 1250 is an initiative of the commission, which
last year unveiled a strategy to guarantee a healthy share of
the global HDTV market for EC industries.
   Under the EC's strategy, HDTV will be introduced
commercially in the EC beginning in 1992 -- in time to cover
the summer and winter Olympics.
   HDTV promises better picture and sound quality than
conventional television. However, international standards and
equipment for transmission must be set. The EC, Japan, and
the U.S. haven't yet agreed on those standards.
                                                                                                       

   LANDMARK RULING IN TOKYO
                                                                                                       

   A Tokyo district court has ruled for the first time that
female workers were denied promotions due to sex
discrimination. It awarded 18 women a total of $640,000 in
lost wages they would have received had they been promoted.
The suit was filed 10 years ago by women who worked for a
medical-insurance fund. In addition to money for lost wages,
the plaintiffs had also sought promotions, but the court
refused, saying it couldn't direct such personnel decisions.
                                                                                                       

   TRINIDAD TOURISM
                                                                                                       

   Tourism officials in Trinidad and Tobago are wooing
Europeans. "We feel Europe is a better market {than the U.S.}
for us," said one tourism official, adding: "Europeans stay
longer and spend more." According to a study by the country's
Tourist Development Authority, U.S. travel to Caribbean
holiday destinations, already in a slump, is expected to
decline further. "The fall-off in demand is being attributed
. . . to a loss in {Caribbean} competitiveness together with
the impact of an expected recessionary period" in the U.S.,
the study said.
                                                                                                       

   NEW JAPANESE COINS
                                                                                                       

   Japanese Finance Ministry officials, overseeing the
minting of 100,000 yen ($662) gold coins to celebrate the
enthronement of Emperor Akihito in November, are going to
great lengths to ensure that the issue is counterfeitproof. A
Japanese news-agency said the new coins would be larger,
contain more gold and be etched with a more elaborate design
than 11 million similar coins issued in 1986 and 1987 to
commemorate the 60th year of the reign of the late Emperor
Hirohito. Allegations last winter that some of the Hirohito
coins were counterfeits reportedly underlies the Ministry of
Finance's attempts to make the enthronement coins impossible
to fake.
                                                                                                       

   BP'S EAST GERMAN PLANS
                                                                                                       

   British Petroleum PLC's West German operating subsidiary
plans to market a range of petroleum products in East Germany
and intends to establish a network of service stations there.
Deutsche BP AG said that to realize its goals of expanding
into the newly opened East German market, it has agreed to a
cooperative arrangement with East Germany's Leuna Werken
refinery and trading group Intrac Handelsgesellschaft.
                                                                                                       

   ITALY'S CATHOLICS VS. MADONNA
                                                                                                       

   Italy's Roman Catholic establishment has begun a campaign
to keep Madonna's European concert tour out of the country.
The Catholic news agency SIR, which reflects opinions of the
Italian Bishops' Conference, decried the singer's use of
crucifixes and sacred symbols in concerts and videos. "Her
new show . . . is an offense to good taste," the agency said.
Madonna, whose ancestry is Italian, is due to perform in Rome
and Turin next week.
                                                                                                       

   EC LABOR-COST STUDY
                                                                                                       

   Southern European Community countries may not have as much
of a labor-cost advantage over the richer northern countries
as is often believed, according to a new EC study.
   Differences in nominal labor costs throughout the EC are
largely offset by differences in productivity, the study
said, meaning there is little incentive for companies to
shift production to low-wage member states.
   "Low wages do not necessarily mean low labor costs," the
EC Commission report said. It said the cost of labor as a
percentage of the value added to a product during
manufacturing varies only slightly from one EC country to
another.
   The study notes that the United Kingdom, where wages are
often lower than in other EC states, "has unit labor costs .
. . comparable to, and in a number of cases higher than,
those in the Federal Republic of Germany, France and Italy."

   Police in Buenos Aires arrested three employees of the
Argentine capital's largest municipal cemetery. The three are
suspected of stealing hundreds of used coffins and, after
refurbishing them, selling them as new. . . . In London,
Barbara Johnson, an heiress to the Johnson &amp; Johnson
health-products fortune, bought an 18th-century cabinet at
Christie's for $15.3 million. According to the auction house,
the lavishly inlaid "Badminton Cabinet," made in Florence for
a Duke of Beaufort, thus became the most expensive piece of
furniture in the world.

   MADRID -- A Spanish gas utility being set up by
state-controlled oil firm Repsol S.A. and savings bank La
Caixa will offer shares to outside investors, in a public
flotation that could be worth between 45 billion pesetas and
80 billion pesetas ($445.1 million and $791.3 million).
   Repsol Chairman Oscar Fanjul said the two partners are in
discussions with Spain's National Stock Market Commission
over details of a plan to merge their gas interests,
announced last week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Depending on the results of an audit and the size of the
assets to be transferred by both partners, Mr. Fanjul said
the new mega-utility is expected to be worth between 90
billion pesetas and 170 billion pesetas. Its shares will be
listed on the stock exchange through a public flotation that
could take place some time in the first half of 1991, he said
in an interview.
   The project calls for the formation of a holding company
jointly owned by La Caixa and the state oil and gas agency
Instituto Nacional de Hidrocarburos, which controls Repsol.
INH will hold its 50% stake through Repsol and its sister
company, Enagas S.A, the state gas firm.
   The joint holding company, in turn, will own at least 51%
of a mega-utility controlling local gas utilities whose
capital will be open to outside shareholders.
   Neither of the two companies to be created has yet been
given a name, and details of the project will be determined
after an audit of both firms' gas interests.
   However, the new utility's principal assets will be
controlling stakes in Barcelona-based Catalana de Gas S.A.,
of which La Caixa owns 24% and Repsol 14%, and Gas Madrid
S.A., of which INH controls 87% directly and through Repsol.
   A final decision concerning the size of the new utility's
Gas Madrid stake will depend on an audit to value the
Catalana shares to be transferred, Mr. Fanjul said.
   Because the project involves the takeover of Catalana, the
new utility will also be obliged to offer minority Catalana
shareholders a chance to exchange their shares for shares in
the new firm. The number of shares to be floated publicly
will depend on the shareholders' response to this offer, Mr.
Fanjul said.
   Analysts said the operation could present an attractive
opportunity for investors to gain access to a new Spanish gas
utility on the model of British Gas or Gaz de France.
   But they said the success of the operation is likely to
depend on the terms offered to Catalana shareholders, many of
whom traditionally have shown strong loyalty to the company.
   An additional uncertainty is the attitude of British Gas,
which recently acquired 10% of Catalana and which hasn't
shown any interest at this stage in joining the Repsol-La
Caixa project.

   Is Estimated at 14%-16%;

   The pharmaceutical industry, largely immune to the
sluggish earnings bug that has hit many sectors of the U.S.
economy, is expected to post a second-quarter earnings gain
of 14% to 16%.
   Profit at several major U.S. drug makers is estimated to
have climbed by between 18% and 20%, reflecting the strong
sales of premium-priced drugs, price increases and benefits
from a weakening dollar abroad.

<TEXT>
   Securities industry analysts said high-margin products
propelled hearty earnings at Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Merck &amp; Co.,
Schering Plough Corp., Warner-Lambert Co. and Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. But earnings at Pfizer Inc. and Upjohn Co. were
estimated to have risen by about 10% or less.
   "Profit growth looks particularly strong {in the industry}
when you compare it to performance elsewhere {in the
economy}," said Ronald Nordmann, a drug industry analyst with
PaineWebber Inc.
   Mr. Nordmann said that while per-share earnings rose about
15% to 16% for the first half of 1990, he expected profit
growth to rise even more sharply for the rest of the year,
moving ahead by about 18% in the third quarter and 21% in the
fourth.
   Analysts said Eli Lilly's quarterly profit would jump the
greatest, increasing about 25% from the $217.1 million, or 75
cents a share, reported in the second quarter of 1989. Growth
was spurred by explosive sales of the anti-depressant drug,
Prozac.
   Patricia Lea, an analyst at Vector Securities
International Inc., Deerfield, Ill., said Prozac sales, far
from prosaic, rose during the quarter at an annual rate of
$700 million to $800 million, up from the $320 million it
registered in 1989. The drug has received a boost from a host
of news stories citing it as relatively safe, with fewer
annoying side effects than other anti-depressant medicines.
   Eli Lilly's growth also was due to strong sales of its
catheters, devices used to diagnose heart disease. In
Indianapolis, a spokesman said the company wouldn't comment.
   Analysts believe Merck's earnings rose about 20% to 21%,
due to continued strong sales of several products, including
its cholesterol-lowering agent, Mevacor; Pepcid, an
anti-ulcer drug; and Vasotec, a heart disease drug. Merck,
with a large presence in Europe and Japan, previously had
been hurt by adverse foreign currency translations as a
result of a strong dollar. Analysts said such translations in
the second quarter won't hurt drug makers with overseas
business as the dollar's value has softened.
   In the second quarter of 1989, Merck earned $396.6
million, or $1 a share. Merck, based in Rahway, N.J.,
declined to comment.
   Bristol-Myers was expected to post a profit gain of about
20% from the $345 million, or 66 cents a share, it reported
in the 1989 second quarter. Analysts said the company was
helped by the combination of sales forces resulting from the
merger between Bristol-Myers and Squibb last year.
   In particular, sales of Bristol-Myers' drug Capoten, which
competes against Merck's Vasotec, benefited from the
additional marketing clout. The company's antibiotic Duracef
gained sales when a court banned the sale of generic
competitor following a lawsuit over the drug's patent.
   "Bristol-Myers also implemented some very aggressive price
hikes for some of its products," said Robert Uhl, an analyst
at Salomon Brothers who tracks drug price increases. He said
that during the quarter the company increased prices by 14%
for the company's Squibb line of drugs and 17% for its
Bristol Laboratories line. The New York company declined to
comment.
   Analysts said profit for Warner-Lambert and
Schering-Plough was expected to jump about 18% to 20%.
Warner-Lambert profit was buttressed by sales of Lopid, a
anti-cholesterol drug, while Schering moved ahead on sales of
Proventil, an asthma medicine, and its broad line of other
prescription drugs.
   In Morris Plains, N.J., Warner-Lambert, which earned
$112.4 million, or 83 cents a share accounting for a stock
split, in the year-earlier period, declined to comment.
Schering-Plough, in Madison, N.J., which earned $120.5
million, or 54 cents a share after a stock split, also
declined to comment.
   Analysts said that profit for Pfizer and Upjohn are
estimated to have risen more slowly, growing by between 8%
and 10%. Analysts said the Pfizer earnings were damped by
marketing costs related to the sale of several new drugs, and
the analysts said the cost of several other product
introductions later this year also may slow earnings growth
for the rest of the year. New York-based Pfizer earned $135.7
million, or 80 cents a share. It declined to comment.
   Upjohn, which earned $94.6 million, or 51 cents a share,
in the 1989 second quarter, continued to suffer from slowing
sales of its leading drug products, Xanax and Halcion,
analysts said. Even so, earnings benefited from a pretax gain
of $35 million to $40 million from a pension settlement. In
Kalamazoo, Mich., the company declined to comment.

   U.S. Will Conduct
   Thrift Case Against
   Neil Bush in Public

   President's Son Says Decision

   WASHINGTON -- The Office of Thrift Supervision said it has
decided to make public its conflict-of-interest case against
Neil Bush, the president's son and a former director of a
failed Denver thrift, over his protests that the action is
"political."
   The thrift office also announced that an administrative
law judge has ordered a Sept. 25 hearing in the case
involving Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The thrift office announced the date of the hearing and
released its administrative charges against Mr. Bush as part
of a new policy under which more of the agency's enforcement
cases will be made public. The September hearing will be open
to the public as well.
   Mr. Bush objected that making his case public "would be
political," said Harris Weinstein, chief counsel of the
thrift office. But Timothy Ryan, thrift office director, made
the decision to open the case.
   Mr. Ryan said the new policy "is necessary to reassure the
public that as regulators we are doing everything possible to
assure the integrity of thrift institutions and the
protection of the taxpayer."
   The thrift office has charged that Mr. Bush violated
savings-and-loan regulations by voting to approve Silverado
loans to a business partner, and by failing to disclose to
the Silverado board his business ties to borrowers. The most
important charges released yesterday had already been aired
in House Banking Committee hearings on the Silverado failure.
   Mr. Bush has denied any wrongdoing, arguing that while his
business partners invested in his oil and gas operations, he
didn't invest in their businesses and thus wouldn't benefit
by helping them obtain loans. Mr. Bush served on Silverado's
board from August 1985 until August 1988. He resigned after
his father won the Republican presidential nomination.
Silverado was taken over by the government in December 1988,
at an expected cost to taxpayers of $1 billion.
   The OTS is seeking an order barring Mr. Bush from
violating S&amp;L regulations in the future. He refused to sign a
consent agreement in January, leading to the filing of the
administrative charges in February. The administrative law
judge will recommend action to Mr. Ryan, who will make the
final decision.
   Under the thrift office's new policy, administrative
hearings on enforcement actions involving thrifts that have
been closed or taken over by the government will be open to
the public. The targets of the charges may ask that the
thrift office close the proceedings, but the final decision
lies with the agency's director.
   The thrift office said enforcement hearings that involve
officers of still-operating S&amp;Ls will generally be closed,
out of concern that publicity could cause a depositor run.
But if the individual involved isn't a current officer, the
OTS said it will be "inclined" to make the proceedings
public.

   To Head Off
   Tax Increase

   ST. LOUIS -- The beer industry, led by Anheuser-Busch
Cos., is about to launch an intense lobbying effort to head
off an increase in the federal excise tax on beer.
   Built around the theme, "Can the Beer Tax," the blitz is
meant to alert the nation's estimated 80 million beer
drinkers to the likelihood of a tax increase. Newspaper ads
are to run early next week. Broadcast ads are being
developed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ads are part of a wide-ranging campaign to ignite
public ire over what the industry calls an unfair, regressive
tax that would hurt the working man but do little to shrink
the deficit. Last week, President Bush said that tax
increases are needed to narrow the deficit. Higher taxes on
alcohol, tobacco and gasoline are considered a strong
possibility.
   Anheuser, the world's largest brewer, and its competitors
are worried that any tax increase would depress already flat
sales.
   The federal excise tax on beer, now $9 a barrel, hasn't
been raised since 1951, although most states have since
tapped the so-called "sin tax" as a revenue source.
   Industry sources speculate that the tax could be raised
anywhere from 100% to perhaps 600%. The Beer Institute, a
Washington trade group, estimates that a doubling of the tax
would result in a 4% volume decline in retail sales. The
current federal excise tax on a six-pack costing $3 is 16
cents. A doubling of the tax, then, would add another 16
cents, but the institute estimates that the total increase
would be about 25 cents because of price rises during
distribution.
   The lobbying campaign also is to include calls on
congressional members by beer distributors, petitions
circulated at country-music concerts, briefing books for the
media, banners flown over beaches and an 800 phone number
that triggers a personalized letter to the caller's
legislator.
   While some tactics, including print ads, have been in
preparation for months, President Bush's recent reversal on
taxes threw an Anheuser task force into high gear, working
through the holiday on Wednesday. "We ruined a lot of
people's Fourth," one company executive said. "This is an
uphill battle," said another.
   A 100% increase in the excise tax on beer would raise
perhaps $1.5 billion, according to the Beer Institute. "No
one at Anheuser-Busch is against evenhanded efforts to curb
the federal deficit . . . but excise taxes are anything but
evenhanded," say letters written by the company's chairman
and chief executive officer, August A. Busch III, to
employees, wholesalers and suppliers. The letters argue that
any tax would "hurt the business performance of our . . .
entire industry for years to come."
   Although the summit talks haven't turned to specific tax
increases, higher alcohol and tobacco taxes are among
possibilities mentioned by negotiators. Besides raising
money, advocates say, the levies would discourage consumption
of harmful substances. But Democrats protest that relying
heavily on consumption or sales taxes would be regressive.
And some Republicans say the taxes wouldn't raise enough
money to compensate for the political controversy that would
provoke.
   Anheuser's lobbying actually began on the Fourth of July,
when some of its 960 distributors used parades and festivals
to buttonhole politicians and distribute petitions. In
Connecticut, the state beer wholesalers association hired a
plane to drag a "Can the Beer Tax" banner along the coast. In
Texas, industry representatives sought petition signatures at
various "freedom" festivals and at the Waylon Jennings-Willie
Nelson concert in Austin.
   In Jasper, Georgia, a life-size replica of a Clydesdale
horse with a banner urging voters to contact their
congressmen and senators appeared in a parade. The grand
marshal was Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr., a Democrat and part of the
bipartisan budget summit group, the membership of which is
targeted for heavy lobbying.
   Anheuser's plans, part of what it calls Operation
Preparedness, also include speakers on taxes who can be
booked on radio talk shows; a minority interest group
speakers bureau; "Ax the Tax" nights at American Legion
halls; and plans to capitalize on media interest in the
advertising campaign itself. Another possibility, if the bugs
can be worked out, is a computer game called "You Balance the
Budget."
   Newspaper ads, which will appear across the country
starting Monday, show a woman wearing a large diamond
bracelet and holding a can of beer. The copy, which says
Americans already pay more excise tax on the beer than the
jewels, urges beer drinkers to make Congress "read our lips"
and gives an 800 number to call. The ads are signed by the
Beer Institute.
   While Anheuser is considering radio and television ads
with its own signature, Miller Brewing Co., the nation's No.
2 brewer, "won't be doing any advertising," says a
spokeswoman for the Philip Morris Cos. unit. "We believe the
Beer Institute is doing a fine job of explaining how we
feel."

   BATESVILLE, Ind. -- Fewer people are dying, and an
increasing number don't want to be buried.
   Those are the facts behind flat earnings for the nation's
biggest casketmaker, Hillenbrand Industries Inc. "In the last
two years there have been fewer deaths in the U.S. and Canada
than what the funeral industry had anticipated," the company
said in reporting results for its Batesville Casket Co. unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While Batesville was able to offset a revenue decline by
raising prices on caskets and boosting its market share, a
Hillenbrand spokeswoman acknowledged that the company had
unused plant capacity.
   "We are poised for growth when it does come," she said,
alluding to government statistics that indicate the future
will bring more customers because of the aging population.
Indeed, Social Security Administration figures show that U.S.
deaths dropped to 2,141,000 last year from 2,171,000 in 1988,
but should increase to 2,164,000 this year.
   Another negative element for the industry: More and more
people are choosing cremation over burial. "The West Coast is
a very active area for cremations, as is the Northeast," the
spokeswoman said, adding, "In the heartland of the U.S.,
there is a much more traditional view." Despite that trend,
most who wish their remains to be burned first still want a
funeral service with a casket, she said.

   NEW YORK -- The Conference Board reported that its index
of help-wanted advertising continued its steady decline in
May, slipping two points to its lowest level in four years.
   The independent business research group said the index
fell to 137 in May, down from April's revised 139. The index
lags 15 points behind the year-earlier level of 152. The
index is based on a survey of help-wanted advertising volume
in 51 major newspapers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said, "The word
`cautious' best describes the labor market right now. There
is a definite softness in demand." The index, a seasonally
adjusted indicator of hiring plans, uses 1967 as a base of
100.
   Despite increases of 7.5% in the South Atlantic region,
2.6% in the West South Central region and 0.6% in the East
South Central region, the remaining six regions of the
country showed declines in May from the April level.
   The most severe declines continue to be in New England and
the Middle Atlantic regions. Both were down about 9% in their
regional indices in the past two months, and both recorded
steep declines in help-wanted ad volume, by about 33% and
20%, respectively, from year-earlier levels.
   Still, Mr. Goldstein expects a "turnaround," first in the
Western labor markets and then eastward, spurred by export
activity in the second half of this year.

   Management gurus may wail about product quality, customer
service and global markets, but few things worry corporate
America more these days than its workers.
   Even as layoffs continue, demographic changes have
companies expecting shortages of qualified recruits. Many
businesses are trying to do more with fewer employees.
Attention is shifting to recruiting, training and retaining
the most productive people. But staying competitive in pay
and benefits is more costly than ever. And many companies,
fearing an economic downturn and stiffening foreign
competition, are hesitant to promise their workers long-term
security.

<TEXT>
   Senior executives from five companies traded concerns
about this complex agenda in a roundtable interview with Wall
Street Journal reporters Gilbert Fuchsberg and Amanda Bennett
at last week's convention of the Society for Human Resource
Management. The executives all fretted about health-care
costs and the prospect of new hiring and firing constraints
arising from the civil-rights bill now pending in Congress.
But they disagreed on whether loyalty will rise again in the
'90s as a popular commodity in factories and offices.
Highlights from the discussion follow, grouped by topic.
                                                                                                       

   BENEFITS MUST GO, NOT GROW
                                                                                                       

   MICHAEL R. LOSEY, president, human resources, Unisys
Corp.: The issue is cost. Human resources isn't just
delivering programs. It's minimizing cost. And most cost in
most companies walks with two feet.
                                                                                                       

   WILLIAM F. WAYLAND, executive vice president, human
resources, Textron Inc.: I believe {health care} is the
single most important cost issue the human-resource
profession will have to deal with. We are paying $3,200 or
$3,300 or $3,500 a year per employee, and the Japanese are
paying virtually nothing.
   Go back to the auto companies in the late '60s and '70s.
From basic health-care coverage, prescription drugs were
added, and mental health was added, and then dental was
added, and then hearing was added and then legal fees were
added. Then they started peeling them away again. The legal
is disappearing, and the vision is beginning to disappear.
                                                                                                       

   W. THOMAS VAN ETTEN, senior vice president, human
resources, Sun Bank/Miami N.A.: We spend a lot of time trying
to educate supervisors and managers to the fact that we write
off that PC over a four- to five-year depreciation schedule.
But as soon as you hire somebody, you've got a {growing}
expense that's there for life. You're going to pay them more,
spend more for benefits, give them more vacation. Are we
getting a return on that investment?
                                                                                                       

   MORE LAYOFFS INEVITABLE
                                                                                                       

   MR. LOSEY: {When Burroughs merged with Sperry to form
Unisys,} we had 125,000 people; today I have 78,000. General
Motors has fewer people {than in the past}, IBM has fewer
people, Apple has fewer people. I don't know a company that
isn't downsizing.
                                                                                                       

   MR. VAN ETTEN: I see companies downsizing as they grow {in
sales}. They will continue to grow but hold the line on
management as long as they possibly can.
                                                                                                       

   JAMES A. PERKINS, senior vice president, personnel,
Federal Express Corp.: {Many recent layoffs happened} because
the company lost market share or suffered some kind of
setback. It's in everyone's best interest -- the employees,
the stockholders, management and everyone -- to improve
productivity. We're growing, but I think the common problem
that we all face {is} tremendous pressure because of
competitiveness to continue to improve quality and
productivity and lower the cost to the customer.
                                                                                                       

   LOYALTY IS THREATENED
                                                                                                       

   MR. WAYLAND: I don't think we will see a lot of allegiance
to companies. We will see that whittled away. There will be
more portability. There's going to be that much more of a
demand for talent. I think we're going to be able to attract
and keep the shop-floor worker in small-town America. But the
technical people and the management people I think are going
to move. I think we're going to go back to the 1950s, when
people moved from location to location.
                                                                                                       

   WANDA A. LEE, corporate vice president, human resources,
FHP Inc.: I think you're going to see more use of independent
contractors {who} come in and stay for six months. You won't
treat that person as an employee. You're going to treat them
as a vendor, which is probably how they're paid. So you're
going to have a shifting work force. Not that you wouldn't
prefer to keep {employees}, but maybe you wouldn't because
maybe there is no growth for them and they're going to become
dissatisfied. I see companies that are also saying let's get
into career development, recognizing that chances are, the
freedom to leave can become the freedom to stay.

   MR. PERKINS: The trend in the future will be a reversion
to the past. I think {employees} really want a long-term,
trusting relationship with their company. They really want to
have a history and a pride. But I don't think any longer the
employee can go to work with the idea of trying to decide how
they can do less. Instead, it has to be a mindset that they
need to able to do and produce more.
                                                                                                       

   PRODUCTIVITY IS A PUZZLE
                                                                                                       

   MR. PERKINS: I think there is an increasing awareness that
a company's human resources {are} a competitive weapon. There
is an awareness that well-trained, highly motivated employees
really can make a difference in terms of improved
productivity, improved quality.
                                                                                                       

   MS. LEE: Machines used to do a lot of the work, and what
did you do? You improved the way the machine could function
so that it could function better with less power. {That's}
what we haven't learned how to do with people. How can you
help people produce more by helping them work smarter, not
harder? That's the new model that we have to develop. Over
the next 10 years we'll have no choice but to learn how to
measure productivity in an information age. But we're not
there now.
                                                                                                       

   CIVIL RIGHTS REVISITED
                                                                                                       

   MR. PERKINS: As the new {civil rights} legislation is
written, people will be allowed to sue for pain and suffering
and punitive damages {when alleging that they were denied a
job or promotion because of discrimination}. What should a
company do {if}, out of 50,000 managers, there is one manager
who discriminates against an individual? Under the new
legislation, the person will be able to sue for punitive
damages -- and how much are we talking about here? Are we
talking about a couple of hundred dollars or are we talking
about several million dollars?
                                                                                                       

   MS. LEE: I think we all believe in equal employment
opportunity, but the way that this is designed . . . benefits
attorneys more than anyone else.
                                                                                                       

   MR. VAN ETTEN: We are going to be looking at a labor
shortage. It's already here. Who wants to discriminate
against anybody as long as they are properly trained,
educated, alert and ready to work?

   HOLLYWOOD -- Judging by early box office returns from the
July Fourth holiday, News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox film
"Die Hard 2: Die Harder" looks like it has a chance this
coming weekend to produce the top-grossing opening week of
any summer movie.
   On 2,378 screens Wednesday -- a day when fireworks
displays and holiday barbecues competed for audiences -- the
film grossed $5.9 million. In Tuesday night special
screenings on 1,800 screens across the country -- with some
theaters featuring one show, others two -- the movie grossed
$3,692,833; these totals, however, won't be included in the
five-day "weekend gross" figures released Monday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These figures could make "Die Harder" competitive with the
top opener of the summer so far, Carolco Pictures Inc.'s
"Total Recall," which grossed more than $35 million in its
first week.
   "Die Harder," co-produced by action-movie mogul Joel
Silver, is estimated to have cost a whopping $62 million just
to make, plus an additional $30 million to market and place
into theaters. The original "Die Hard," also starring Bruce
Willis, grossed $85 million in 1988.
   Putting this sequel into production was one of the first
official acts by new Fox film Chairman Joe Roth when he
assumed his current post less than a year ago. The studio has
lagged behind most other major studios in the past few movie
seasons.

   Coal Mining Firm,
   Dairy Face Fines
   On Safety Charges

   WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department proposed fines of
$508,000 against Pyro Mining Co., a coal-mining concern, and
$1 million against Johanna Farms, a dairy and citrus-product
packaging firm, on charges of safety violations.
   The department's Mine Safety and Health Administration
cited Pyro Mining's William Station mine in Union County,
Ky., for 121 violations, including alleged electrical-safety
violations and failure to make required safety examinations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The mine-safety agency said the proposed fine stemmed from
a methane explosion at the mine last September that killed 10
people. The agency said the explosion occurred after
explosive methane gas accumulated without being detected.
   The penalties would be a record amount for the mine-safety
agency, four times the largest fine assessed for any previous
single mine accident. The violations were "flagrant" and
showed Pyro Mining's "negligence," William Tattersall,
assistant secretary of labor for the agency, said.
   Separately, the department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration cited Johanna Farms, Flemington, N.J.,
for violating safety and record-keeping standards. The
company, which packages dairy products, citrus juices and
yogurt, is a unit of John LaBatt Ltd., a holding company
based in North London, Ontario.
   Johanna Farms was cited for 197 willful instances of
failure to report injuries and illnesses and for 23 instances
of allowing workers to be exposed to unguarded machinery.
OSHA said 34 employees also were exposed to unguarded
sprockets and chains, among other safety violations. Gerard
Scannell, assistant secretary of labor for OSHA, said the
company suffered "a serious breakdown in its internal safety
and health program."
   Pyro Mining has 30 days to contest its citations and
proposed fine before the independent Federal Mine Safety and
Health Review Commission. Johanna Farms has 15 days to
contest its citations and fine before the Occupational Safety
and Health Review Commission.

   DALLAS -- Greyhound Lines Inc., which filed for protection
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy code last month,
said it agreed to resume paying its former parent company,
Greyhound Dial Corp., for rentals and leases on 15 major bus
terminals, a New York City maintenance facility and about
2,000 buses.
   Phoenix, Ariz.-based Greyhound Dial officials estimated
the payments at about $3.8 million a month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   J. Michael Doyle, Greyhound Lines senior vice president
and chief financial officer, said the agreement would permit
Greyhound Lines to develop its reorganization plan without
having to spend time deciding whether to assume or reject
hundreds of leases held by Greyhound Dial, which retains a
22.5% stake in the closely held bus company.
   Greyhound Lines and five other units of GLI Holding Co.
filed for bankruptcy law protection last month in
Brownsville, Texas, following a financially devastating
strike by the Amalgamated Transit Union.
   Although the agreement was filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Brownsville, federal Judge Richard S. Schmidt was
not asked to approve it, although he has permitted Greyhound
Lines to use current revenue to meet operating expenses.

   REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   Mr. Nader Goes to Moscow

   Ralph Nader has just returned from a look at the new
Soviet man and is more than a bit discomfited at the shape of
things to come. While he did establish links with a new
consumer federation there, the latest Village Voice reports
he was "bewildered" by the fascination with free-market
ideology he found. "It's creeping anarchy," he told the
Voice. "Here is a system that was once ruled in an iron
grasp, and it's just falling out of control. . . . They're
swinging from Marx to Milton Friedman. They are the world's
experts on bureaucracy and the state. But they don't know
anything about what the market is going to do to them."
   Perhaps not, but it's our impression that the Soviet
citizenry has a crystal-clear view of what the public
bureaucracy has done to them. We called Mr. Nader for
amplification, and he outlined his nightmare of what a future
Soviet Union may look like.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A drive toward capitalism "means they will jump from the
frying pan into the fire. They are in danger of joining the
Third World and becoming an imitative economy and an
imitative culture borrowing everything from the West. They
are going from criticizing all that's Western to being
sycophantic about everything Western."
   Mr. Nader says many Soviets are only too willing to "sell
out" and become tools of multinationals poised to flood the
Soviet Union with useless products. "They don't need
Coca-Cola," he says. "They need nutritious fruit juices." He
warns that the Soviet Union is about to become a dumping
ground for the worst aspects of Western culture and
commercialism.
   Some of his Soviet hosts seem to have taken Naderism with
a grain of salt. Mr. Nader told Leningrad's Mayor Anatoli
Sobchak, an ardent free-market advocate, that democracy can
be perverted by powerful private interests. The Voice reports
that Mr. Sobchak gently told Mr. Nader that "our problems are
at a different level" and that "the key task is to wean power
away from the state and invest it in society. We must worry
about private power, but the immediate task is reducing the
power of the state over the economy."
   Mr. Nader was also startled when told by Moscow's reform
leaders that they wanted to create independent television
networks with foreign help. "I told them that even capitalist
America doesn't allow foreign ownership of television
properties," he says. "If they do that Western companies will
simply flood them with mindless American-style
entertainment."
   That's a thought worth pondering. Dumping segments of
"L.A. Law" on the Soviet Union might turn the whole reform
movement away from the U.S. system. Still, Sergei
Stankevitch, Moscow's deputy mayor, reminded him it was
impossible for them to create new networks without foreign
investment. "Why not try to combine leisure entertainment and
serious problems?" he asked Mr. Nader.
   Mr. Nader says he is still hopeful the Soviets can be
rescued from a headlong rush into the free market. He hopes a
nationwide consumer movement will act as a braking mechanism.
One possibility, we suppose, would be to rehabilitate former
KGB officials as Nader's Raiders or the Soviet Public
Interest Research Group.
   Of course, if Mr. Nader really wants to slow the pace of
change, he could just parachute in a few hundred U.S.
trial-lawyer friends. Once the American plaintiffs' attorneys
started suing the socks off the fledgling private sector,
that would guarantee that the Soviet Union would remain
uncorrupted by Western capitalism.

   Bristol-Myers Puts
   Davidson in Role
   With Added Duties

   NEW YORK -- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said Wayne A.
Davidson, president of the pharmaceutical and nutritional
group, will take on additional responsibilities to head the
company's world-wide pharmaceutical business.
   The new duties strengthen Mr. Davidson's position as a
candidate to succeed Richard L. Gelb as chief executive
officer and illustrate the continued consolidation of the
company under control of executives from Bristol Myers.
Bristol Myers Co. and Squibb Co. merged last year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Davidson, 58 years old, who came from Bristol Myers,
assumes responsibility for the Bristol-Myers Squibb
Pharmaceutical Research Institute, which previously was
overseen by Richard M. Furlaud, president of the company.
Moreover, Mr. Davidson, who had reported to Mr. Furlaud,
Squibb's chairman and chief executive officer before the
merger, now will report directly to Mr. Gelb, who previously
headed Bristol Myers.
   The changes are more evidence that the transaction
announced last July as a merger was actually Bristol Myers's
acquisition of Squibb. "At the top, it's Bristol, except for
the head of research and development," says Marc Mayer,
analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. And the research
chief, Edgar Haber, reports to Mr. Davidson.
   Both Mr. Gelb, who is also chairman of the new company,
and Mr. Furlaud are expected to retire soon, analysts say.
"Now we have to say that Davidson is the person to watch,"
says Viren Mehta of Mehta &amp; Isaly, drug industry analysts.
   Mr. Furlaud remains as president and also was named as a
member of the Office of Chairman to work on strategic and
policy issues with Mr. Gelb, the company said.
   When the merger was announced, speculation about who would
succeed Messrs. Gelb and Furlaud focused on Mr. Davidson and
Jan Leschly, then president of Squibb and head of its
pharmaceutical operations. But Mr. Leschly, explaining that
he wasn't part of the acquiring company, resigned in October
and last month was named to head SmithKline Beecham PLC's
world-wide pharmaceutical business.
   Charles A. Heimbold Jr., executive vice president, and
another Bristol Myers official, heads the company's consumer
products business and is also considered a potential heir
apparent. Because the pharmaceutical business is regarded as
the company's biggest profit center, some analysts believe
Mr. Davidson, also an executive vice president, is in the
stronger position.
   The company said Mr. Davidson wasn't available for an
interview yesterday.

   BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB Co. said that responsibilities of
executive vice president Charles A. Heimbold Jr. include the
health care and medical products groups and corporate
strategic planning and development, as well as the consumer
products group. Mr. Heimbold's duties weren't fully described

   WASHINGTON -- Federal criminal investigators have
identified the biggest fish so far in their inquiry into a
defense-industry ring that illicitly obtained and swapped
Pentagon planning secrets -- and he is likely to get away.
   Malcolm R. Currie, the high-profile chairman of Hughes
Aircraft Co. -- a General Motors Corp. subsidiary and the
nation's fifth-largest defense contractor -- received some of
the same classified information that landed lower-level
industry officials in jail for ferreting it out of the
Defense Department, federal court records show.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Currie may have done more than just read excerpts from
internal Pentagon papers passed along to him by underlings.
According to testimony by several former Hughes employees and
documents filed in federal court in Alexandria, Va., Mr.
Currie approved a system to funnel hundreds of pages of
Pentagon documents into Hughes while circumventing the
company's normal security procedures. The allegations were
made in open court last month but haven't been reported until
now.
   Yet the criminal investigation of Mr. Currie, which has
been under way for several months, according to several
law-enforcement officials, seems unlikely to lead to an
indictment. Mr. Currie currently isn't a target of the grand
jury investigating the scandal. But investigators are
contemplating filing some sort of civil action against
several companies and individuals, including Mr. Currie.
   Prosecutors may be frustrated in pursuing a criminal case
against Mr. Currie because of timing. The five-year statute
of limitations covering the company's document-gathering
activities expired three months ago. Also, the Justice
Department complicated matters in March, when -- believing it
had wrapped up its case against Hughes by getting a guilty
plea and $3.6 million in penalties from the company -- it
said it wouldn't seek criminal charges against senior
management. The internal Hughes memoranda most damaging to
Mr. Currie didn't surface until later, investigators say.
Finally, the investigation has been slowed by the refusal of
seven former and current Hughes officials to cooperate unless
immunized from prosecution.
   Michael Costello, the lead Pentagon investigator on the
documents case, declines to discuss the allegations against
Mr. Currie. But speaking generally about top defense-industry
executives, he says, "The ones that got away, got away by the
skin of their teeth."
   Mr. Currie, through a Hughes spokesman, declined to be
interviewed for this article. General Motors also declined to
comment.
   One of the most sweeping white-collar inquiries in years,
involving several major defense contractors and billions of
dollars in weapons contracts, the government's data-swapping
case thus far has netted only lower-level figures. Six
marketing managers from five companies have been found guilty
of improperly distributing sensitive Pentagon planning
reports.
   By obtaining bootlegged copies of internal Pentagon
spending plans, Hughes and other contractors were able to
more effectively target their marketing and research efforts,
according to investigators. That gave the contractors an edge
over less-knowledgeable competitors, and an advantage in
negotiations with the Pentagon.
   The six convicted managers maintained that their
activities had been sanctioned by top officials at their
companies. Yet at least in public the managers gave little
specific evidence of that approval. Memos sent to Mr. Currie
offer the first solid corroboration that the information
gleaned from the Pentagon documents actually found its way to
the highest levels of defense corporations.
   For instance, a 13-page analysis of advanced
attack-weapons programs prepared by a Hughes employee in
March 1983 and sent directly to Mr. Currie began by saying,
"What I have reviewed are the following data: . . . POM
84-May 1982." POMs, or Program Objective Memoranda, are
documents intended only for a few dozen senior Defense
Department officials; Mr. Currie, a former chief of Pentagon
research, had served at a level at which such documents were
customarily circulated. Their cover sheets carry the notice:
"Disclosure restricted."
   "I made sure that Mal Currie knew what I was doing,"
former Hughes budget analyst Frank Caso, who prepared that
13-page analysis, testified at his federal court trial in
Alexandria last month. "He thoroughly supported it, endorsed
it. In his very nice charming way, he put his arm around me
and said, `I've known you a long time, Frank. I'm looking
forward to working with you a long time.'" Mr. Caso was
convicted of trafficking in classified government documents
and is awaiting sentencing.
   A Hughes spokesman said that Mr. Currie "did not have any
knowledge of the conduct for which Mr. Caso was convicted."
Because Mr. Caso is still to be sentenced, the spokesman
said, it would be inappropriate to say anything else about
the matter.
   The revelations in the Caso trial threaten Mr. Currie's
reputation as one of the defense establishment's leading
lights. When he took over as chairman of Hughes, he seemed
the perfect choice to right a large and troubled
organization. He brought with him a Ph.D. in engineering,
experience in Washington, and a candid style seldom seen
among top defense-industry executives. His predecessor had
left under the cloud of an unrelated criminal investigation.
   Comfortable in the spotlight, the dapper, silver-haired
Mr. Currie became an Iacocca-like spokesman for Hughes in the
company's first national ad campaign. In a two-page spread in
the June 4 issue of Time magazine, Mr. Currie discoursed on
the "perfect partnership" between General Motors's
manufacturing experience and Hughes's technical expertise.
   Out of the public eye, Mr. Currie had problems -- though
they were unrecognized at the time. In 1977 he had become
chief of Hughes's missile division, which, among other
things, builds armaments for jet fighters and anti-tank
weapons. Between then and the spring of 1983, when he moved
on to a higher post at Hughes headquarters, he received at
least four memos from Mr. Caso or his associates that
referred by name to classified Pentagon documents that
contractors weren't supposed to see. Among the documents
cited in the memos are some that Mr. Caso was convicted for
handling.
   One memo about the outlook for defense spending, for
example, referred in its first paragraph to the Pentagon's
"Consolidated Guidance," a blueprint for long-term spending.
Such documents typically carry the warning "Not Releasable to
Contractors-Consultants."
   Other top company officials received Hughes memos stamped
"Marketing Sensitive" that quoted from restricted Pentagon
documents. These executives include D. Kenneth Richardson,
the current president of Hughes, and Ted Wong, now the head
of the missile group. Mr. Wong declined to comment. His
attorney said, "I don't know what he knew." Mr. Richardson is
traveling in Europe and couldn't be reached for comment. A
Hughes spokesman said he didn't believe Mr. Richardson had an
attorney. The government has indicated that based on current
evidence, it doesn't intend to seek criminal charges against
either man.
   Mr. Currie was interviewed once by Defense Department
investigators earlier this year, after the Hughes plea
agreement was filed, law-enforcement officials say. They
didn't put him under oath; officials decline to discuss why.
Mr. Currie said then that he wasn't aware of any
improprieties at Hughes.
   On March 9, when Hughes pleaded guilty in the documents
case, Mr. Currie issued a letter to company employees that
stated: "The acquisition and possession of such documents was
wrong and cannot be justified. . . .We have all learned from
this incident, and we should all renew our personal
commitment to the standards of business conduct and integrity
we have set for ourselves."
   Mr. Caso's lawyers wanted Mr. Currie to testify at last
month's trial, but Mr. Currie's attorney refused to accept a
subpoena on behalf of his client. By the time a new subpoena
was issued, Mr. Currie had left on a previously scheduled
trip to Brazil. "He would have been an essential witness,"
says Marcus Topel, an attorney for Mr. Caso. Seven other
current and former Hughes officials declined to testify,
invoking a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
   Prosecutors already have demonstrated that
document-swapping became almost commonplace among defense
contractors in the early 1980s. Employees of roughly a dozen
contractors obtained the papers and traded them as routinely
as business cards. Some of the documents that Mr. Caso
illicitly brought into Hughes bore distinctive markings
showing they came from Boeing Co. Richard Lee Fowler, a
former Boeing analyst described by prosecutors as the kingpin
of the information-gathering ring, and the subject of a
page-one article in The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 15, is in
jail for his role in the scheme.
   The ring of document-swappers, which prosecutors dubbed
"the Clique," went to great lengths to hide its tracks.
According to testimony at Mr. Caso's trial, officials at one
company went so far as to install wheels under the giant
cabinets in which they stored their bootlegged documents.
Whenever Pentagon security inspectors showed up, the
officials rolled the cabinets to the roof of their office
building.
   At Hughes, the government alleged that Mr. Caso and some
of his cohorts logged in unauthorized documents under phony
titles, used special courier passes to avoid inspection by
security guards, and slipped some of the material into
personal desk drawers not subject to Defense Department
searches.
   There is no suggestion that Mr. Currie participated
directly in the Clique by obtaining documents from Pentagon
officials or by making clandestine trades with other
contractors.
   Yet company employees testified that he was aware that
Pentagon secrets were being brought into the company. The
employees said they took his response to mean at least tacit
approval. "The man {Mr. Currie} was a former assistant
secretary of defense. If he didn't know the rules . . . who
was I to know?" Sharyn Pinkstaff, Mr. Caso's former
assistant, testified. Ms. Pinkstaff, who has been granted
immunity from prosecution and who appeared at the trial as a
government witness, still works for Hughes. She declined to
be interviewed.
   She also testified that she used to deliver some of the
unauthorized documents themselves -- not just memos about
them -- to high-ranking Hughes executives, including Mr.
Currie.
   And she went on to make more serious allegations about the
chairman. All defense companies with security clearances are
required to maintain a system to safeguard, track and certify
the disposal of the classified information they receive.
Pentagon agents routinely inspect contractors' compliance
with the regulations for those security systems. Ms.
Pinkstaff testified that after Mr. Caso received a written
reprimand from Hughes security personnel in 1978 for a sloppy
accounting of the classified documents in his possession, he
told her he personally appealed to Mr. Currie to authorize a
new document-identification system that would avoid such
hassles. Both Ms. Pinkstaff and Mr. Caso said from the
witness stand that Mr. Currie did just that.
   Under this new system, government exhibits in the Caso
trial indicate, Mr. Caso could bring any papers he wished
into the Hughes classified document network without company
security officers scrutinizing their contents. Keeping the
illicitly obtained documents in the security system --
sometimes under obscure labels -- could give them the
appearance of legitimacy and make it easier to move them
around within the company. Material brought in by other
Hughes employees was examined more closely, investigators
say. Eventually the security requirements for Mr. Caso were
loosened even more, allowing him to log in documents merely
by making a phone call to a Hughes clerk.
   Jim Calder, who was security chief at the missile division
in the late 1970s, made a note to his file after a meeting
with Mr. Caso and Mr. Caso's boss, Eugene Babb, to discuss
the new arrangement.
   In the note, filed in federal court, Mr. Calder wrote:
"Caso and Babb described their meeting with M.R. Currie . . .
in which Currie was made aware of both the current and
previous system that Caso has maintained for sensitive
information gathering. Both stated that Currie supports the
continuation of information gathering. Allegedly, Currie told
Caso to be extremely careful in his involvement with this
matter." Mr. Babb, who has retired from Hughes, declines
comment. So do Mr. Calder and his attorneys.
   In an earlier memo to his files, Mr. Calder emphasized the
importance Hughes placed on Mr. Caso's information-gathering.
"Caso may not be the only person in the company doing what he
considers to be important for our business," the memo said,
"but he is the only one I know of with an identifiable
charter."
   In the mid-1980s, Pentagon investigators had begun to
stumble across classified documents in odd places. Poking
around in contractors' files, they soon realized the extent
to which the government had lost control of its secrets.
Following a trail of copied documents, they discovered the
Clique.
   A couple of years later, as the grand jury inquiry swung
into full gear, Hughes launched its own internal
investigation. At least six officials were forced out of the
company, law-enforcement officials say. Hughes, eager to
continue doing business with the government, eventually
turned over to the Justice Department a huge volume of
internal documents, including the memos to Mr. Currie that
laid out the Pentagon secrets.
   But investigators received Mr. Calder's memos from his
attorneys only about three months ago. It is those memos that
are most damaging to Mr. Currie.
   Yet investigators think the people behind the Clique
probably will remain beyond their reach. "There's no doubt in
our mind that senior people in these corporations were
involved," Mr. Costello says. "They had knowledge of the
activities and shared in the wealth of the information. It
goes way up the corporate chain."

July 4, according to the Investment Company Institute, a

   Assets of 250 general purpose funds fell $723.9 million to
$133.21 billion, and assets of 102 broker-dealer funds fell
$1.29 billion to $157.88 billion. Assets of 161 institutional

   Individual accounts were most affected by the decline in
money market fund assets. Dr. Jacob Dreyer, vice president

in prices of stocks and bonds in the week preceding the
Fourth of July drew some money out of short-term funds,
especially those in the broker-dealer category, and into
long-term funds."

   May Need More Training

   MORE CONSULTANTS are rushing to help family-owned
businesses.
   But veteran family-business consultants say too many
newcomers lack credentials for untangling complex
family-business issues, such as succession and sibling
rivalry.
   Rod Correll, executive director of the Family Firm
Institute, says, "The interest in family-business consulting
seems to have doubled over the last two years. And there is
no mechanism for credentials." Membership in the Johnstown,
N.Y.-based institute, an organization of consultants and
others serving family businesses, also has doubled, to 500
members this year from about 250 in 1988.
   New programs for family-business owners are proliferating
-- not to mention books, magazine articles and university
courses -- in a nod to the growing awareness of family
problems affecting small businesses. In September, the Center
for Management at the Institute of Living, a psychiatric
hospital in Hartford, Conn., will begin quarterly seminars to
help 50 firms resolve family tensions.
   No figures are available on the newcomers catering to
family businesses, but they range from accountants to family
therapists. Added to those are many big companies that didn't
target family businesses a decade ago -- like the accounting
concerns Laventhol &amp; Horwath and Grant Thornton, as well as
Wall Street firms like Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. --
which recently expanded into the booming field.
   But John Messervey, longtime director of the National
Family Business Council, a Northbrook, Ill., consulting firm,
says many newcomers have "invested much in marketing and
little in training. Frankly, many are not equipped to handle
the problems."
   The Family Firm Institute conference in Atlanta in October
will discuss possible qualifications and credentials for the
field.

   POLITICAL GIVING by small-business owners is increasing in
the wake of heightened congressional interest in issues
important to small companies, says the National Federation of
Independent Business.
   The largest national small-business organization says
contributions to its political action committee war chest
jumped to $214,000 in 1989. While relatively small by PAC
standards, that's still three times more than the group ever
collected before in a year with no congressional elections.
   The federation's PAC receipts have passed $300,000 for the
two-year election cycle ending this year; the goal is
$500,000.
   As previously reported, small companies also have
increased lobbying efforts. Their concern over matters that
came before Congress this year -- such as federal regulation
of fringe benefits, required company leave for new parents
and an increased minimum wage -- also helped swell the PAC
war chest, says John Motley, the federation's chief lobbyist.
"People give when they're scared and angry," he says.
   Mr. Motley says the federation ran its PAC "as an
afterthought" until 1987, when it overhauled its political
fund-raising machine to make it more effective. He says the
federation now identifies members who are "proven givers,"
goes to them repeatedly for contributions and specifically
acknowledges their donations.
   But the group is helping candidates in other ways besides
PAC contributions. For instance, Mr. Motley says the
federation is recruiting its members to work in local races
for candidates with pro-small-business backgrounds. "Now
we're doing the things the unions have been doing for years,"
he says.
                                                                                                       

   Franchise Rules Are
   Back Off Drawing Board
                                                                                                       

   THE REVISED DRAFT on legislation to regulate franchising
was made public last month -- and the most controversial
parts had been excised.
   A committee of the North American Securities
Administrators Association released the revision for public
comment, says committee head Debra M. Bollinger, director of
South Dakota's securities division. The original draft was
released last July. "Substantial redrafting has been done in
almost all of the sections," Ms. Bollinger says, and several
sections were eliminated.
   The committee hopes the revised draft will be adopted as a
model for state franchising legislation. Ms. Bollinger says
the association, whose members are involved in state
regulation of franchises, is expected to consider the matter
at a meeting in August.
   Many franchisers opposed the group's original proposal for
a Model Franchise Investment Act, says David J. Kaufmann, a
franchising lawyer in New York. He says they particularly
disliked provisions regarding termination of franchises. For
example, the original draft would have required franchisers
to buy goods and equipment of terminated franchisees. Mr.
Kaufmann called that draft "another effort to kill -- or at
least overregulate -- the goose that laid the golden egg."
   But the newest draft contains no such provisions.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends

   Nutricia's Narrowing of Focus Pays Off
   ---
   Infant-Food Firm Now
   Expanding With Care

   ZOETERMEER, the Netherlands -- N.V. Verenigde Bedrijven
Nutricia has a simple product strategy: It makes food for
people who don't have any choice about what they eat.
   Nutricia is one of the top European makers of infant
formula and baby cereals, competing with the likes of Nestle
S.A. of Switzerland and Milupa AG of West Germany in a market
where doctors and parents call the shots. Once an infant
outgrows such fare, Nutricia bows out, leaving the
mass-market food companies to scrap over fickle appetites.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The moment you don't feel well," says Erlend van der
Hagen, Nutricia's management-board chairman, "we jump in
again." The company's other core business is making special
foods and nutritional supplements for the ill, sold mostly to
hospitals.
   Somewhat less simple are Nutricia's choices about where to
expand outside its base in Western Europe -- a vital question
as the company seeks to retain its independence in a rapidly
consolidating food industry.
   Many Dutch companies have long viewed the U.S. as their
top priority for overseas growth. But Nutricia, which got a
late start breaking out of its home market, says it wants to
avoid an expensive fight for a large slice of the U.S.
market. Instead, Mr. van der Hagen said in an interview, the
company will put a higher priority on Europe (notably the
southern and eastern parts where its sales are still small)
and on the Far East.
   For decades after it was formed in 1901 by a doctor and a
dairy-plant operator, Nutricia was content with the Dutch
market. After World War II, the company spilled over the
border into Belgium. Then, in the 1970s, Nutricia made a
strategic choice that Mr. van der Hagen says was "totally
wrong." Rather than trying to become a global player in the
products it knew best, the company confined itself to the
Benelux market and diversified its product range into
margarine, sauces, pickles, processed fruits and snacks.
   By 1979, that strategy had driven Nutricia into the red.
The company's product range was too unfocused, and its
markets too small.
   Mr. van der Hagen, a grandson of one of the founders,
reacted by moving from Nutricia's supervisory board to the
management board in 1979. He quickly began selling the
diversified food units. "I simply put the company back to its
origins," he says.
   Mr. van der Hagen decided that Nutricia's future was in
products for which medical endorsements are vital rather than
those that require mass marketing. (The company kept a few
mass-market products, such as Chocomel chocolate milk and
Nutroma coffee creamer, which provide an outlet for milk fat
separated out in making infant formula. But those products
are sold only in the Benelux countries.)
   Mr. van der Hagen's approach has worked so far: Nutricia's
net income has doubled in the past five years, reaching 60.3
million guilders ($32 million) last year on sales of 905.3
million guilders, and the company's return on equity is well
above average at about 20%. The company also has raised the
share of its revenue derived outside the Netherlands to about
64% from 20% a decade ago.
   Mr. van der Hagen says Nutricia began to organize
production on a pan-European scale long before the 1992
unified market plan took off. Asked about 1992, he says, "We
invented it in 1980."
   Even so, Nutricia had little presence in West Germany
until April, when it acquired Immergut Milch G.m.b.H., a
dairy-products company. Mr. van der Hagen promises to
transform Immergut into a German version of Nutricia.
   Milupa, Germany's leading infant-formula and baby-cereal
maker, says it isn't worried. Told about Nutricia's
ambitions, Milupa director Joerg Zehelein says, "Well, good
luck." Mr. Zehelein notes that other foreign health-care and
nutrition companies have found the German market extremely
hard to penetrate.
   One challenge for Nutricia is that German doctors tend to
favor feeding hospital patients intravenously. Nutricia's
products are "enteral" -- that is, absorbed through the
digestive system rather than the blood stream. But Mr. van
der Hagen says the German market is rapidly changing as
doctors recognize the advantages of enteral feeding, which is
far cheaper.
   Meanwhile, Nutricia predicts that it can increase its
market share in southern Europe and says it is gradually
building up ties with the medical profession in Eastern
Europe. Last year, after an eight-year effort, Nutricia
finally cracked the Soviet market with a big sale of infant
formula.
   The graying of the population is expanding the market for
medical nutrition throughout Europe; Campbell Management
Consultants of Brussels estimates that European sales of
enteral foods are growing 15% to 20% a year. But competition
is growing, too. Last year, Nestle and Baxter International
Inc. of the U.S. set up a joint venture in medical nutrition,
Clintec International Inc., which already has set up units in
Britain and Italy.
   While defending its home market, Nutricia also is trying
to expand in Asia, where it has sales units in Hong Kong and
Taiwan and a 50% share of a new infant-formula plant in
Indonesia. Though Asia accounted for just 3.6% of sales last
year, Mr. van der Hagen says Nutricia aims to become one of
the leading suppliers there.
   The U.S. market already is mature and offers less room for
growth. In any case, analysts suspect that Nutricia doesn't
want to draw retaliatory attacks in its home market from such
companies as Abbott Laboratories Inc. and Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co., which dominate the U.S. infant-formula market.
"We have no ambition to get into a fierce fight with Abbott,"
Mr. van der Hagen says.
   Milupa apparently agrees. The German company closed a
small infant-formula factory in the U.S. last year after
deciding it had better growth prospects in Europe.
   Still, Mr. van der Hagen says Nutricia needs to be present
in the U.S. market to keep up with developments. Toward that
end, Nutricia acquired Loma Linda Foods Inc., a Riverside,
Calif., maker of soybased infant formula, from a Seventh-day
Adventist Church organization in 1988. Loma Linda has about
2% of the U.S. infant-formula market, and Mr. van der Hagen
says Nutricia hopes to boost that share gradually.
   Though Mr. van der Hagen talks cautiously, Dutch
investment analysts tend to be bullish on Nutricia. On the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange, the company's nonvoting
certificates, representing shares held by a trust, are
trading at about 14 times projected 1990 earnings, compared
with a market average of 9.7. Even with that high rating,
says Frans van Schaik of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Nederland
N.V., Nutricia is still an attractive investment. He predicts
net income will surge at least 20% this year and another 10%
in 1991.
   Nutricia's certificates occasionally get a boost from
takeover speculation. Mr. van der Hagen says that many major
food companies have approached him about making a friendly
bid for Nutricia but that none has been able to tell him what
would be in it for Nutricia. (Unigate PLC of Britain owns
about 25% of the shares but can't raise its stake without
permission of Nutricia's board.)
   Though Nutricia says it is in good shape to survive as an
independent company, it isn't taking any chances. The company
has armed itself with all the protective barriers allowed to
Dutch companies, making a hostile takeover virtually
impossible.
   Earlier this year, the Amsterdam exchange pressed Nutricia
and other companies to give up some of their protective
barriers in an effort to bring Dutch stock market practices
closer to international norms. As a gentle form of pressure,
the exchange began using a special symbol in its official
gazette to flag companies that refuse to modify their
protective devices.
   Nutricia was unimpressed. "We have a black dot," Mr. van
der Hagen says gleefully, "and we're very proud of it."
   Eventually, the European Community is expected to force
Dutch companies to reduce their takeover protections. If that
happens, Mr. van der Hagen says, the company will simply find
somewhere else to list its nonvoting certificates.

   Medical supply companies are expected to report earnings
growth averaging 12% to 15% for the second quarter,
continuing a robust performance despite government and
corporate efforts to hold down hospital costs.
   For the strongest performers, analysts say, earnings
growth reflects the strength of new products, stability in
the rate of hospital admissions and changes in hospital
buying practices. But it also underscores the success of
diversified business lines, particularly pharmaceuticals, for
such concerns as Johnson &amp; Johnson and Abbott Laboratories.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Calling some of the major {companies} hospital suppliers
is a bit of a misnomer," says Daniel T. Lemaitre, health-care
analyst at Cowen &amp; Co. "Some of these companies have as
little as 35% of sales going to hospitals." Even so, Mr.
Lemaitre says, their hospital businesses are healthy in part
because patients admitted to hospitals these days are sicker
and require more surgical procedures, thus leading to some
growth in unit sales.
   Adds Joseph D. France, who tracks hospitals and
medical-supply concerns at Smith Barney: "Hospitals are
focusing more {purchases} on fewer vendors, which benefits
the larger companies." In addition, companies are beginning
to establish small price increases, compared with cuts of up
to 15% in the mid-to-late 1980s, he says. The increases are
"low single-digit," he says, but "it's better than a sharp
stick in the eye" and should contribute to what he sees as
strengthening results over the next 12 months.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to report second-quarter
profit of about $1 a share, up 12% to 14% from 89 cents or
$297 million a year ago. The improvement reflects
double-digit increases in sales, strong results from its
Ethicon wound closure business and success with
erythropoietin, or EPO, a drug for dialysis patients,
Hismanal, a non-sedating anti-histamine, and a new diagnostic
test for hepatitis-C.
   Johnson &amp; Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., says it
understands that $1 a share is the consensus second-quarter
forecast on Wall Street, but hadn't any other comment. Mr.
Lemaitre sees the potential for "an upside surprise" and
projects Johnson &amp; Johnson at $1.05 a share, up nearly 18%.
   Analysts see Abbott's earnings rising about 15% to 16%, to
about 55 cents a share, from $212.6 million or 47 cents a
share a year ago, adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split. The
growth reflects stronger sales that were slowed last year by
problems in its infant-formula business. One big success,
says Mr. Lemaitre is IMx, an automated test used to diagnose
such diseases as hepatitis, cancer and thyroid dysfunction.
Sales of the product could reach $250 million this year, its
second full year on the market, the analyst says. Abbott,
North Chicago, Ill., said it hadn't any comment.
   Baxter International, Deerfield, Ill., is expected to
realize some benefits from its recently announced
restructuring, but analysts seem uncertain about the precise
impact on second-quarter results. Kent Blair, analyst with
Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, looks for a 5% to 10% increase,
while Mr. France lists Baxter at 40 cents a share, up 14%
from $104 million, or 35 cents a share, a year ago. "The
thing most people will pay attention to is the gross margin
improvement," says Mr. Lemaitre, who sees it improving to
above 35% from 33.7% in the first quarter. Baxter declined to
comment on analysts' projections.
   Becton Dickinson &amp; Co. is expected to report a 20% profit
rise, to about $1.20 a share from $39 million, or 99 cents a
share, from continuing operations. Year ago net after special
gains was $86.4 million, or $2.19 a share. The year-ago
quarter was particularly weak due to a glut of surgical
gloves and heavy spending to protect its syringe business
from competition, says Mr. Blair. With both problems behind
it, "we're pretty optimistic that Becton is going forward,"
Mr. Blair says. Becton, Franklin Lakes, N.J., didn't have any
comment.
   C.R. Bard Inc. continued to struggle in the quarter with
the impact of the U.S. recall last year of its line of
angioplasty catheters, and analysts see another year of
turmoil ahead for the Murray Hill, N.J., concern. Bard is
expected to report earnings off by nearly 50% to 20 cents a
share from the year earlier $21.3 million, or 39 cents a
share. George Davis, Bard's chief financial officer, said the
estimate is "in the ballpark."
   Among the major hospital companies, National Medical
Enterprises Inc., Los Angeles, is expected to report profit
up 17% to about 74 cents a share, from $54.8 million or 64
cents a share from continuing operations a year ago.
Year-earlier net income, after a loss from discontinued
operations, was $5.5 million, or seven cents a share. With
strong results in each segment of the industry -- acute,
psychiatric, and rehabilitative care -- National Medical "is
outperforming the industry in general," says John Hindelong,
a Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst. National Medical
declined comment.
   Humana Inc., Louisville, Ky., recently reported an 18%
profit rise for its fiscal third quarter ended May 31. Net
income was $85.3 million, or 84 cents a share, up from $72.3
million, or 72 cents a share, a year ago, reflecting strength
in both its hospital and insurance businesses.
   Net at Community Psychiatric Centers, Laguna Hills,
Calif., was up 2% in its second fiscal quarter ended May 31
over a year ago, the company recently reported, but income
from continuing operations rose 16% to $23.9 million, or 52
cents a share, from $20.6 million, or 45 cents a share. Much
of the growth reflected price increases and the addition of
new facilities, analysts said, noting that patient days and
admissions at hospitals open more than 12 months fell
slightly from the year ago period, while average revenue per
patient day was higher.

   Unlisted stock prices fell further in a market shaken by
more weak second-quarter earnings outlooks.
   Weakening expectations rattled the OTC market Monday and
Tuesday, and more pessimistic projections disturbed investors
yesterday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They're definitely putting the jitters into the market,"
says David Memmott, OTC trader at Dillon, Read &amp; Co. Mr.
Memmott says OTC investor enthusiasm could be damped further
by a few disappointments early in the second-quarter
reporting period that will begin later this month.
   Many players stayed home yesterday, leaving some OTC
trading desks thinly staffed in anticipation of light
activity for the remainder of the week. The absences were
evident in volume, which totaled a mere 97.8 million shares,
compared to Tuesday's 131 million shares.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 2.57, or 0.56%, to
459.19, but suffered less than the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index, which fell about 1.1%.
   Robert O'Toole Sr., head of institutional sales trading at
Shearson Lehman Hutton, says "buyers were on strike"
yesterday.
   OTC advancers trailed decliners, 676 to 1,094.
   Late Tuesday, Microcom slashed its previously reported
fiscal fourth-quarter and year-end results and said it also
expects to report a bigger loss for the first quarter than
had originally been anticipated.
   The company's stock lost nearly half of its value in June
after the company announced that it would lose money in the
first quarter ended June 30. The stock dropped nearly 30%
yesterday, down 2 5/8 to 6 1/8.
   On Tuesday, Mentor Graphics startled owners of its shares
by announcing that its second quarter profit would amount to
a mere 10 cents a share or less, far below expectations and
down sharply from the 29 cents a share reported in the
quarter a year ago. The company's stock suffered a 4 3/8
point loss Tuesday and fell another 7/8 to 16 3/4 yesterday.
   Specialty retailer Sharper Image slipped 3/8 to 4 7/8
after announcing that it expects to report a second-quarter
loss of 15 cents to 20 cents a share, compared with last
year's second-quarter profit of one cent a share. The company
blamed "the current retail environment" for the loss.
   Roadway Services fell 1/2 to 34 1/2. The trucking company
reported this morning that profit in the second-quarter fell
to 58 cents a share from 67 cents in the same quarter a year
earlier. The latest quarter's earnings were below analysts'
estimates.
   Other OTC transportation stocks slipped, including trucker
Yellow Freight Systems, off 1/4 to 26 7/8, and school-bus
operator Laidlaw, whose Class B shares eased 3/8 to 23 1/8.
The Nasdaq Transportation Index was the worst performing
sector of the OTC market, dropping nearly 0.9%.
   Hibernia Savings Bank lost 1 1/4 to 5 3/4 after omitting
its quarterly dividend. On Tuesday, the bank said it will
report losses for its second quarter and six months due to
real estate loan-loss provisions.
   Workstation makers Tandon and Sun Microsystems both edged
higher. Tandon gained 1/16 to 3 13/16 on heavy volume, while
Sun Microsystems gained 1/8 to 33 1/4.
   Apple Computer, however, fell 1/2 to 43 1/2, while
chip-maker Intel lost 1/2 to 47.
   Foremost fell another 3 3/8 to 22 1/4. On Tuesday, the
stock dropped 4 1/2 after the insurer said it had ended
efforts to find a buyer for the company.
   Hamilton Oil added 4 1/2 to 39 3/4 after it announced the
discovery of natural gas in the Irish Sea off the West coast
of England.
   Altos Computer gained 7/8 to 8 1/4 after signing an
agreement to be acquired by Acer Group for $8.35 a share.
   NEC's American Depositary Receipts rose 1 1/2 to 66. The
Japanese company has unveiled a mainframe computer that it
calls the world's fastest. However, analysts are skeptical
that the new machine will boost the company's tiny share of
the world mainframe market, according to an article that
appeared in this newspaper yesterday.
   CCAIR, which does business as USAir Express, said it filed
a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code. The stock lost 7/8 to 1 1/4.
   Insurance brokers firm Poe &amp; Associates added 3/4 to 12,
while fellow brokers Hilb, Rogal &amp; Hamilton rose 1/4 to 14.
Yesterday's "Heard on the Street" column in this newspaper
reported that some analysts are saying now is the time to buy
insurance brokerage stocks. Those analysts say the pricing
cycle for property and casualty insurance has bottomed and
may be ready for an upswing. Poe and Hilb, Rogal were two
firms cited as good buys by an analyst quoted in the story.
   Specialty soap maker Neutrogena added 1 3/8 to 23 1/8. At
least one analyst attributed the move to "short covering," in
which investors who have sold borrowed shares of the stock
buy new shares to repay their stock loans, according to Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report. Socalled short sellers
hope to gain from a drop in the price of a stock, and cover
their loans when they believe a stock's price has hit bottom.

   Law:
   Eight Companies
   Are Named in Case
   On Toxic Labeling

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Two environmental groups here said they
filed an administrative complaint against Dow Chemical Co.,
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and six other concerns charging that 16
common household spot removers and paint strippers made by
the companies violate California's tough toxic labeling law.
   Among the products named were Dow Chemical's popular K2-r
Spot-lifter and Sears Paint and Varnish Remover. Under the
law, makers of products containing known carcinogens must
label them with "a clear warning of the cancer risks."
Companies that fail to do so can face fines of as much as
$2,500 per consumer estimated to have bought the product
during the time that chemicals have been on the state's
official carcinogen roster.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the case of the 16 products named in the complaint, the
exposure is 15 months, thus the potential liability adds up
"comfortably to hundreds of millions of dollars," said David
Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund. The fund filed the
action with the Sierra Club. The toxics law, known as
Proposition 65, was adopted by voters in 1986 but contained
phase-in provisions designed to give companies time to
comply.
   The fund and the Sierra Club filed a similar complaint in
September against Gillette Co. for its alleged failure to
label its Liquid Paper correction fluid. Gillette, without
admitting guilt, agreed to pay a $300,000 settlement to the
state and changed the Liquid Paper formula to eliminate the
offending carcinogen.
   Under the toxics law, any citizen or group may file an
administrative action if it believes the labeling law isn't
being adhered to. The complaint by the fund and Sierra Club
triggers a 60-day period in which the state must decide
whether it will prosecute the alleged offenses. If it
declines to do so, the law allows the environmental groups to
file their own suits to seek damages on behalf of the public.
   As the Gillette case demonstrated, the unofficial purpose
of the 60-day period is to give alleged offenders an
incentive, avoiding the prospect of enormous fines, to
reformulate their products or quickly comply with Proposition
65's labeling provisions. Any such voluntary agreement,
however, "doesn't {necessarily} exempt the companies from
potential penalties," said the fund's Mr. Roe.
   Besides Dow Chemical, Midland, Mich., and Chicago-based
Sears, the action names Jasco Chemicals Corp., Mountain View,
Calif.; Standard Brands Paint Co., Torrance, Calif.; Thompson
&amp; Formby Inc., Montvale, N.J.; Carbona Products, Brooklyn,
N.Y.; Northern Labs Inc., Manitowoc, Wis.; and Cadillac Shoe
Products Inc. of Royal Oak, Mich.
   A Dow Chemical spokesman said, "If we're not in
compliance, we'll change that. But whether or not we're in
compliance, I can't say right now." He added that there has
been some confusion over which products should be covered by
the law.
   Daniel Thomas, general manager of Jasco, and Craig Walker,
a Standard Brands vice president, said the companies hadn't
seen the complaint but are in compliance with the law.
   Officials of the other companies couldn't be reached for
comment.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Will Lendl Win It at Last?
   ----
   By Frederick C. Klein

<LP>
   London I think I should begin this piece by saying that I
like Ivan Lendl, the tennis player. He is punctual and
polite, and able to make small jokes in a language not his
own (English), no small feat. I interviewed him once, and he
invited me to his home, showed me around and offered me a
Diet Coke. That may be no more than expected in most circles,
but in jockdom it passes for high hospitality.
   He is conscious of the history of his sport and concerned
about his place in it, other attributes that many top
athletes do not share. Further, he does not pretend to
disdain what he has not been able to obtain, another minority
position among the accomplished.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As anyone who can follow the bouncing ball knows, what
Lendl hasn't been able to obtain is a Wimbledon singles
title, which would round out a rare career "Grand Slam." How
much he wants one has been a main topic of discussion at
these proceedings, which enter the men's semifinal round
today with him still in it.
   The bony-faced Ivan and the assembled press have spent the
fortnight fencing about the meaning of the word "obsessed."
The former Czech lad, now a 30-year-old Connecticut squire,
won't accept that psychologically loaded label, but has said
he would trade all of his previous Grand Slam crowns,
numbering eight (three French, three U.S. and two Australian
Opens), for the All-England bauble. That might not amount to
obsession, but the price Faust paid wasn't much higher.
   Lendl has gone about his quest in his characteristic way,
which is to work very hard at it; this is a guy who, if he's
not playing tennis, is running, bicycling, pumping iron or
engaging in some other athletically useful activity. He and
his coach, Tony Roche, have noticed that Wimbledon is played
on grass, and have shaped their spring schedules around
spending as much time as possible on the surface. This
entailed skipping the claybound French Open, where Ivan is
very much at home, and at which he would have been the
favorite.
   It's here appropriate to note that finding a grass tennis
court is no easy matter. The things are difficult and
expensive to maintain, yield bad bounces in the best of times
and wear down easily; by the time this tournament is over,
Wimbledon's famed and pampered Centre Court will be as much
brown as green, and sport wellworn ruts along its back and
center lines.
   I have played tennis for 25-odd (really odd) years, and
have never set foot on a grass court. Neither, I'd guess,
have you. There are some here in England, of course, and a
scattering in Australia and the U.S., mostly at clubs that
also have "cricket" or "croquet" in their names. The surface
is, in a word, archaic, which is why it's silly to call
Wimbledon the world's tennis championship, as some do. But
that's another subject.
   If any of the above indicates that Lendl has been a
failure in this tournament over the years, it's
unintentional. He's reached the finals twice -- in 1986 and
1987 -- and last year led Boris Becker, the eventual
champion, two sets to one in a semifinal before bowing. He
thus reasoned that a little improvement would go a long way,
and that greater grass-court familiarity would provide it.
   Asked the other day what he's worked on, he mentioned his
footwork and return of serve, and, naturally, his volleying,
the last of which dispenses with erratic grass-court bounces.
But he added: "Mostly it's just spending the time on grass;
not having to pack all my preparation into a few days. This
year, if it rained, we could do something else and not worry
that we were losing time we couldn't make up."
   It could be that Ivan is right, but it also could be that
he's wrong, and that longer lawn time won't help him. My view
is that the ability to play successful grass-court tennis is
a knack, like juggling or being able to memorize whole pages
of a telephone book at a glance. Players of all styles and
nationalities have won here, some with little or no
background on the stuff.
   Sweden, for example, has about as many grass courts as it
has Club Meds, but its Bjorn Borg won Wimbledon five times,
and he was a bred-in-the-bone base liner to boot. Germany has
a similar lack, but in 1985 a 17-year-old Becker showed up in
the men's draw for the first time, said the German equivalent
of "aw, shucks," and whupped everybody country-style. He's
done it twice more since, without special preparations, and
is back in the semis again today.
   It could be that Lendl secretly shares my view, because he
has shown little pleasure in his labors here to date. He
dropped a set in his first-round match with Christian
Miniussi (ranked 116th), another in round three to Bryan
Shelton (No. 125), another in the fourth round to Alex
Antonitsch (48), and yet another in Wednesday's quarterfinal
with Brad Pearce (120), a chunky Utahan whose main previous
distinction was that he'd made the doubles final in a
tournament in Schenectady.
   Poor Ivan has grouched around more than usual, and
continually taps his shoes with his racket between points.
That latter gesture perhaps expresses a wish to be back home
on clay, where shoe-tapping serves a purpose (to knock out
the dirt).
   After his match with Shelton, a pleasant but limited young
player from Huntsville, Ala., Lendl explained how the
wham-bam of grass-court tennis offended his methodical
nature. He noted that while Shelton's forehand was lacking,
"you can't expose his weakness on grass. His serve is big,
and every now and then you get a funny hop on the serve, and
then he comes in and hits some decent volleys." So instead of
something like 6-3, 6-2, 6-1, the scores were 7-6, 6-7, 6-4,
6-4, and "whew."
   It's true that Lendl has been aggressive here, looking,
for a change, a bit more comfortable at the net than a hooked
salmon. It's also true that after beating the Austrian
Antonitsch on Tuesday he declared, "I'll never stay back
again," meaning that he wouldn't revert to his base-lining
ways.
   But he quickly smiled and said he was kidding, which
looked truest of all. If he does win here, Wimbledon just
might never see him again.

   Dollar Gains as Traders Seek to Correct
   Oversold Positions Ahead of Jobs Report

   NEW YORK -- The dollar strengthened against other major
currencies yesterday as dealers moved to correct, and profit
from, what many considered an excessive recent decline by the
U.S. currency.
   Many U.S. foreign exchange dealers took the day off,
apparently stretching Wednesday's Independence Day holiday
into a long weekend. Those who were active here and in other
markets around the world seemed to be concentrating on
establishing positions ahead of today's June U.S. employment
report.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "A lot of traders came in looking for a lower dollar"
after the currency's retreat in Asian and European trading
Wednesday, said Thomas Palladino, a New York assistant vice
president for Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank.
   "There seemed to be an incentive to push the dollar
lower," Mr. Palladino said, but the move didn't get the
support it needed. "Finally people decided {to say} to heck
with it, square up and wait for employment to come out."
   Michael McGuinness, a foreign currency investment officer
with Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago, attributed the
lack of strong selling to a "feeling that most things have
been overdone" on the dollar's downside, especially what he
called the currency's "skyrocketing decline" against the
British pound.
   "The market was oversold," said Manfred Totzauer, senior
trader for Citibank in Frankfurt, explaining the dollar's
rise in European trading yesterday. If the U.S. report today
on non-farm payroll growth is much better than expected, he
said, "short-covering could take us two pfennigs higher"
against the mark.
   Although the dollar stood higher in late New York trading
yesterday than it was a day earlier in London, it was only
mixed by comparison with its pre-holiday New York levels. The
dollar was quoted at 1.6517 marks, up from 1.6505 late
Tuesday in New York and from 1.6467 marks late Wednesday in
London. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 150.60
yen, which was down from 150.90 in New York before the
holiday but up from 149.75 in London late Wednesday.
   Sterling was trading at $1.7815, up from $1.7775 in New
York Tuesday but down from $1.7845 in London Wednesday.
   In Tokyo early Friday, the dollar was trading at 151 yen
soon after the opening, unchanged from Thursday's Tokyo
close. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.6553
marks, up a bit from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.6551 marks.
   The employment report, due for release at the start of the
New York trading day, will contain the first official U.S.
economic data for June. Market anticipation of easier U.S.
credit has grown in recent weeks. Currency dealers will
scrutinize the data for signs of a U.S. slowdown because they
assume that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
will do the same.
   Non-farm payrolls are believed to have grown by 83,000 in
June, or by 132,000 if layoffs of temporary census workers
are excluded, according to the average of estimates of 20
economists.
   This would follow a gain of 164,000 in May, which included
the hiring of about 145,000 temporary census workers.
   Notwithstanding the market's recent run of thin,
directionless sessions, today "is going to be a wild day,"
said Brian Jones, an economist with Salomon Brothers in New
York. "You're going to get hit with a barrage of numbers," he
said. "Unless they're all going in one direction, you're
going to get bounced around until people have digested the
information."
   Mr. Jones said the often-overlooked hourly wage component
of the employment data may give the Fed a signal on interest
rates that contradicts the one contained in the employment
data. Analysts look for an average gain in hourly earnings of
0.3%, compared with a 0.4% gain in May.
   The dollar finished higher in Tokyo trading Thursday.
Japanese dealers suggested that the market had sold the
dollar too short Wednesday and observed that life insurance
companies entered the market Thursday, buying the dollar
around 150 yen. Other participants followed, but the dollar
subsided after it failed to break resistance about 151 yen.
   A report in the Financial Times newspaper that Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev had been warned by a group of
"prominent politicians, scientists and army officers" of a
possible military coup also helped the dollar gain against
the mark in Tokyo, traders said.
   The most active cross, or non-dollar, trading was between
the pound and the mark. Long, or overbought, pound positions
were unwound against the German currency after the pound
reached about 2.95 marks in early European trading. Sterling
ended the New York session at 2.9425 marks, compared with
2.9385 marks late Wednesday in London.
   London traders still expect sterling to test an area
between 2.98 and 3.00 marks. They also see a chance for the
pound to move toward $1.80 in the next few weeks on
speculation about Britain's possible full entry into the
European Monetary System.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $361.40 an ounce, down 70 cents.
Estimated volume was a light two million ounces.
   In early Hong Kong trading Friday, gold was quoted at
$360.60 an ounce.

   Quarterly Review of Mutual Funds:
   Ten-Year Trailblazer Heebner Enters
   Limelight as Fidelity's Lynch Retires

MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)

<LP>
   BOSTON -- You'd figure that the second-best mutual fund
manager in America could at least boast of being the best
stock picker on his block.
   Not G. Kenneth Heebner. For the past decade, Mr. Heebner
has been toiling down the street from the most successful
mutual fund manager in history, Fidelity Investments' Peter
Lynch, whose celebrity -- and long shadow -- edged well
beyond the Who's Who of finance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now Mr. Lynch is gone, having retired recently at the age
of 46 and leaving Mr. Heebner, a private, 49-year-old
bachelor, in the unlikely role of the nation's pre-eminent
stock market guru.
   "All the attention goes to whoever's No. 1, and that was
always Peter, making it easy for Nos. 2, 3 and 4 to just sit
back and go about their business," says Mr. Heebner from the
spanking new offices of Capital Growth Management Inc., an
investment-fund company he operates in a freshly minted
limited partnership with New England Mutual Life Insurance
Co. "I've always felt being No. 1 is a little dangerous.
People expect too much from you."
   But Mr. Heebner seems to be rising to the task. In the
quarter just ended, Mr. Heebner's various funds have done
well. New England Growth Fund, his largest with $643 million
in assets, returned 15.5% for the second quarter. The fund's
10-year return is 598.95%. Meanwhile, Capital Growth
Management's Capital Development Fund (which is closed to new
investors) posted a robust 17.3% return for the second
quarter, making it one of the top 25 funds for the quarter.
   Over 10 years, Mr. Heebner has guided the Capital
Development Fund to a 703.93% return. Now that Mr. Lynch has
retired -- along with his 1,123.85% 10-year return for
Magellan through May 31 -- Mr. Heebner's 10-year record is
the best of any active fund manager.
   Yet Mr. Heebner has always seemed like a star pitcher on a
middling team. Because his funds are largely sold as what he
himself calls "secondary products" by insurance agents, Mr.
Heebner's performance has never drawn the flood of assets
that his record would seem likely to command. Unlike
Fidelity, whose marketing punch helped turn Mr. Lynch's
skills into more than one million accounts and $14 billion in
assets, New England Mutual has slowly gathered just over $2
billion in assets for Mr. Heebner's various funds.
   So why does Mr. Heebner stay? The recent proliferation of
mutual funds has spawned fierce competition to hire top fund
managers. Mr. Heebner could just about name his price.
   Which, in large measure, is why New England Mutual agreed
last fall to transfer those $2.2 billion in assets handled by
its star money manager into a new operation called Capital
Growth Management. Mr. Heebner and Robert Kemp, the former
president and chief executive officer of Loomis, Sayles &amp;
Co., New England Mutual's investment subsidiary under which
all of Mr. Heebner's funds had been housed, were granted 25%
of Capital Growth Management's equity. They have an option to
gradually obtain a majority position through reinvestment of
earnings over the next five years.
   The incentive of ownership, says Mr. Heebner, "gives a
little extra oomph" to his daily rigors. With his funds at
peak performance and a controlling ownership share in the
offing, Mr. Heebner says he has "never felt more energized."
   Of course, the key to Mr. Heebner's five-year plan is
sustaining his performance. His overall strategy has remained
unchanged since last spring: The softening economy would
weaken many large industries -- such as automobiles, housing
and defense contractors -- but would highlight specialized
"niche" companies that can continue to grow despite a
sluggish economy.
   The stocks he's excited about represent a typical Heebner
mix: a small basket of stocks -- at this point representing
just 21 picks -- including few large companies, some small
growth stocks, and what Mr. Heebner called "a few strange
picks."
   Leading the roster is Philip Morris Cos., in which Mr.
Heebner has invested nearly 8% of his Capital Development
Fund's portfolio. "I understand tobacco's not good for you,
but it sells," says Mr. Heebner, who expects Philip Morris's
earnings to grow as it takes away market share from
debt-strapped RJR Nabisco Inc. Mr. Heebner also likes Eli
Lilly &amp; Co., the pharmaceutical manufacturer, which he said
should continue to see robust sales from an anti-depressant
drug.
   Among smaller, growth stocks, Mr. Heebner says one of his
"strange picks" is Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc., a
retailer of clothes for young men, which he calls "the
Wal-Mart stores of teenage fashion." Earnings growth, he
notes, is better than 30% a year. Mr. Heebner also has
invested in Harley-Davidson Inc., the motorcycle maker, which
he says has revamped both its management and manufacturing in
the past few years and now is trouncing Japanese motorcyle
makers in the export market.
   The analytic thread running through all these picks is
earnings. Mr. Heebner is strictly an earnings man -- has been
since the mid-'70s. "If you're right on the earnings -- which
of course is a feat, based on really understanding the
company -- then stock price will eventually follow."
   It is a dogma Mr. Heebner has returned to in the past
year, after a disastrous lapse. The market's crash in the
fall of 1987 prompted Mr. Heebner, like so many other money
managers, to rethink basic assumptions about market behavior.
Mr. Heebner, a trained economist, assumed interest rates
would rise, causing a credit crunch and sinking both the
economy and the stock market. He pulled back sharply in 1988,
keeping close to 50% of his funds in cash.
   "My underlying assumptions were right -- rates rose and
credit got tight -- but the market kept rising," he says,
shrugging. "We had an abysmal year." Three of his five funds
had negative returns. New England Zenith Capital Growth Fund,
a variable annuity sold only by New England Mutual agents as
part of a whole-life insurance policy, fell 8.9%, while the
market rose 16.6%.
   The drought stretched into the first quarter of 1989, when
Loomis, Sayles Capital Development Fund -- now called the
Capital Growth Management Capital Development Fund -- showed
a paltry gain of 0.76%, placing it nearly dead last among the
258 growth funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc.
   Mr. Heebner notes that despite his fears about interest
rates, corporate earnings rose almost 40% in 1988, well
outrunning a modest decline in stocks' price/earnings ratios.
Again, he concedes, earnings proved to win out -- and, by
spring of 1989, Mr. Heebner had returned to his roots. "I
started again to do what I love to do, analyze companies and
to aggressively invest." The improvements were immediate.
Even after a bad start last year, the Zenith fund finished
the year with a gain of 30.76%, compared with 31.7% in the
S&amp;P 500 index.
   So these days, a revitalized Mr. Heebner strolls each
morning, analyst reports in hand, from his one-bedroom Beacon
Hill apartment to Capital Growth's offices. Beyond the
45-foot sloop he sails on summer weekends, there are few
distractions from the steady beat of analyzing, six days a
week, a flurry of quarterly earnings reports and company
fortunes.
   "It's what I love to do -- if I could, I would do nothing
else," says Mr. Heebner. He says he is happy handling $2
billion of funds, or less than one-sixth of what Mr. Lynch
did, "because when you get that big, you end up doing more
managing than the actual analysis -- which is what I do
best."

   Electro Scientific Industries Inc., Portland, Ore., said
it anticipates posting a loss for its fourth quarter ended
May 31, but it declined to estimate the deficit.
   The maker of electronic equipment cited deferred expenses
from development projects and cleanup costs related to the
sale in April of its Ballantine Laboratories Inc. unit to a
New Jersey company.

<TEXT>
   In the fiscal 1989 fourth quarter, Electro Scientific
earned $2.2 million, or 36 cents a share, on sales of $23.6
million.
   The company throughout the latest fiscal year was plagued
by slumping sales. For the fiscal nine months ended Feb. 28,
Electro Scientific had a loss of $3.1 million, or 52 cents a
share, on sales of $57.7 million. As part of a recent
cost-cutting program, the company has reduced its work force
15% to about 680 employees.

   Fed Has Decided
   Against Easing
   Credit for Now

   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve decided not to ease
credit at its meeting this week, despite signs of a slowing
economy, according to government officials.
   The Fed's lack of action was apparent yesterday when the
central bank made no moves to lower short-term interest
rates. However, officials said they believed the directive
approved by the Fed at its meeting earlier this week provided
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan with the freedom to ease credit
if further signs of economic slowing appeared. A key
indicator of the economy's health comes out this morning when
the Labor Department releases employment figures for June.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Fed's lack of action prompted an unusual rebuke from
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady yesterday.
   In comment to a small group of reporters, Mr. Brady
argued, "In the U.S., it seems to me, it's not a wise idea to
emphasize an undying, forever attack on inflation if it
jeopardizes growth."
   In recent months, the Fed has been unwilling to cut
interest rates because of its continued concern about
inflation. That has led to increasingly loud administration
jawboning for lower interest rates.
   "In our opinion, the inflation is in the services area,"
Mr. Brady said. "It's not clear you can get that down to zero
without jeopardizing growth." He acknowledged that "others
feel differently," but he declared, "I think they're wrong."
   Troubles with the savings and loans and with real estate
"are becoming more apparent," Mr. Brady continued. "It's
quite clear that they would be helped by lower interest
rates."
   An agreement between the White House and Congress to
narrow the deficit could get the Fed to move, according to
Mr. Brady. "I think Chairman Greenspan has indicated that if
we get a budget agreement, he believes interest rates will
come down. I do too." But Mr. Brady added, "I don't think we
should wait around."
   Nevertheless, Mr. Brady noted that the Fed "carries on its
own deliberations" and is "an enormously sensible group of
individuals."

   Sales of Diamonds
   At De Beers Reach
   $2.48 Billion for Half

   LONDON -- Diamond sales of De Beers Consolidated Mines
Ltd. rose to a record $2.48 billion in the first half, an 7%
increase from a year earlier, the company said.
   But sales in the second quarter were slower than in the
buoyant first quarter. Dealers described the diamond market
as quiet. They estimate that of the first half's sales, De
Beers sold about 60% in the first three months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The record sales partially reflect a diamond price
increase of 5.5% at the end of March, the company said. De
Beers, which controls about 80% of the world rough diamond
market, decided to raise prices following buoyant sales in
January and February.
   De Beers reported sales of 2.32 billion for the first half
of 1989. In the second half of the year, the company had
sales of $1.77 billion. Second half sales tend to be lower
than the first half because of seasonal buying trends, De
Beers said.
   Because the diamond market appears to be slowing, total
sales in 1990 might be around $4.1 billion, about the same
annual level as the previous two years, dealers predict.
   Although sales of medium and high quality diamonds are
still reasonable, the market in poor quality diamonds, priced
at $350 a carat or lower, is weak, De Beers said.
   The U.S. market, which accounts for about two fifths of
world diamond jewelry sales, is particularly slow, dealers
said. Japanese diamond imports surged in the first two
months, but since then consumption has waned. Trade in the
European markets, however, is fair, they said.
   After the boom between 1986 to 1988, the market is
returning to normal, De Beers said.
   But Jacques Zucker, a director of Zucker-Berkovic PVBA,
Antwerp diamond dealers, said, "Diamond manufacturers are
being squeezed by falling margins." Prices of polished
diamonds haven't matched the 21% rise in De Beers's rough
diamond quotes during the past 18 months, he said.

   UAL Suspends Talks Over Purchases
   Of Jets Until Aug. 9 Buy-Out Deadline

   UAL Corp. suspended talks over its planned purchase of up
to $15 billion in aircraft until Aug. 9, the deadline by
which a union buy-out group must arrange financing to acquire
the company.
   According to people familiar with the $4.38 billion
buy-out effort, the airline holding company's board approved
suspension of the long-running talks under pressure from
members of the buy-out team.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The buy-out group is seeking to use preferred-supplier
status as a carrot to entice financial backing from the likes
of plane manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie and
engine maker General Electric Co.
   The unions are said to have argued that a UAL jet order at
this time would have undercut their talks with suppliers.
Gerald Greenwald, the former Chrysler Corp. vice chairman now
heading the UAL buy-out effort, made the argument in a recent
letter to UAL's board, according to a person familiar with
the buy-out.
   In an internal memo issued yesterday to employees, the
company said its action is "an effort to be as accommodating
as possible" to the buy-out team. Board members discussed the
action in telephone interviews Monday and Tuesday; a company
spokesman declined to comment.
   A spokesman for the buy-out group, United Employee
Acquisition Corp., said for UAL to place the order "at this
point limits options" suppliers might be considering. "The
issue here is to give suppliers time to examine the means by
which to include financing in their aircraft bids," he said.
   For weeks, industry observers had been waiting for UAL's
United Airlines unit to announce its record order for as many
as 150 jetliners. United was negotiating with Boeing, Airbus
Industrie and McDonnell Douglas Corp. for the planes,
industry sources said.
   At the same time, members of the buy-out group have met
with airlines and suppliers in the U.S. and Europe, seeking
support for their financing efforts. The potential investors
are believed to have included Boeing, Airbus Industrie,
General Electric, Rolls-Royce PLC, British Airways PLC and
Guinness Peat Aviation, a leasing firm.
   While Boeing wouldn't comment on the state of what a
spokesman calls "intense" talks with United about its fleet
needs, any United-Boeing deal would have the potential to be
a landmark for the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer.
   Boeing counts United among its strongest customers
historically. And United is considered a prime candidate to
place one of the several big orders Boeing would need to
launch its proposed 767-X airliner, a 350-seat plane designed
to compete with Airbus A-330s and A-340s and McDonnell
Douglas MD-11s that are much farther along in the development
process. The 767X would be designated the 777 when Boeing
formally launches the plane.
   The Boeing spokesman confirmed that the 767-X and the
company's highest-priced product, the four-engine 747-400,
have been involved in the negotiations with United.
   Boeing's order-taking this year, while strong, has been
lagging behind last year's record clip. More than $32 billion
of Boeing planes were ordered in the 1989 first half. United
placed orders for narrow-bodied Boeing 737s and 757s in April
1989 in a $7 billion transaction, potentially worth more than
twice that amount if all options are exercised. At the time,
UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said that order, as well as the
order now delayed, were designed to stop United's "erosion of
market share and put us back in a vigorous growth mode."
   In 1987, Boeing's close relationship with United took on a
new dimension when terms of the sale of 11 Boeing 747-400s
called for Boeing to acquire $700 million of notes issued by
United's parent company. That seller-financing arrangement
was widely seen as a way for Boeing to help United fend off a
hostile takeover.
   A spokeswoman for the Douglas Aircraft unit of St.
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas wouldn't comment on United's
decision to delay talks. She added that United currently
operates DC-10s, and has been discussing the possible
purchase of 350-seat MD-11s as replacements. McDonnell
Douglas expects to deliver the first of the new MD-11s to
airline customers in the fourth quarter.
   An Airbus spokesman, saying the United decision reflects
"a very dynamic situation" at the airline, said that his
company "will be back there at the table when the opportunity
presents itself again." Airbus "remains enthusiastic" about
the prospect of selling United a mix of 295-seat A-340s and
335-seat A-330s, he said.

   Tokyo stocks finished lower in dreary trading Thursday,
hurt by investor reluctance to participate amid weaker
currency and bond markets, traders said.
   London stock prices also were down.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was down
94.25 points at 32351.67. The index gained 31.32 points
Wednesday.
   At midmorning Friday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index was up
39.72 points to 32391.39.
   Thursday's volume on the First Section was estimated at
460 million shares, down from 546 million Wednesday.
   Winning issues narrowly outpaced losing issues, 476 to
463, while 187 remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the First Section, which rose 13.87 points Wednesday,
slipped 1.31 points, or 0.06%, to 2362.04.
   The Second Section index, which added 19.17 points
Wednesday, jumped 30.96 points, or 0.73%, to close at
4253.80. Volume was estimated at 31.4 million shares, up from
28.3 million Wednesday.
   Julian Jones of W.I. Carr, Sons &amp; Co. (Overseas) Ltd. said
that the yen's retreat in Tokyo trading after a strong
performance overseas overnight was the underlying cause of
the quiet activity.
   The dollar reached a high of 151.10 after closing at
149.75 yen in London late Wednesday and 150.30 yen in Tokyo
Wednesday.
   The currency rate's move above 150 yen to the dollar was
bearish news for the Japanese bond market, with the yield on
the benchmark No. 119, 4.8% coupon of 1999 remaining near
7.22% throughout the day, up two basis points on the day.
   The bond market's weakness inhibited buying in futures,
offering very limited opportunities for arbitrage, which has
been keeping the market afloat over the past few days, Mr.
Jones said.
   Although large brokerage houses were spotted performing
basket purchases on the Nikkei index, including some limited
arbitrage buying, the adverse situation in currency and bond
markets prevented any large gain in futures, putting a cap on
profitability.
   Mr. Jones said, meanwhile, that the recent increased
participation of Japanese brokerage firms in conducting
arbitrage is a new and significant factor for the market.
   Oil stocks were one of the few advancing sectors in the
market Thursday.
   Kevin Haag, a trader in overseas operations at Nomura
Securities Co., said that the rise was probably technically
triggered, with share prices at relatively inexpensive levels
lately.
   But Stephen Good, a representative in Japanese equity
sales at McIntosh Securities, noted that the rise may have
been more fundamental, on speculation that oil prices may
have bottomed out.
   W.I. Carr's Mr. Jones lent support to the latter theory,
making reference to still-higher inventory reports in the
U.S. that have damped oil prices there and have helped weaken
U.K. Brent prices.
   Mr. Haag argued, however, that prospects for oil companies
aren't strong for the mid-term, adding that 4% or 5% growth
on earnings prospects isn't strong enough to justify
fundamental-based buying.
   Petroleum shares advanced broadly, with Mitsubishi Oil
gaining 40 yen (26 cents) to 1,260 yen and Nippon Oil rising
30 yen to finish at 1,360.
   Also higher were electricals and precision machinery
makers. Aiwa was up 90 at 2,540 and NEC advanced 30 to 1,990.
   Nikon increased 20 to 1,700 while Konica gained 60 to
1,630.
   Construction companies generally finished the day lower
after their strong advances Wednesday. Ohbayashi went down 30
to 1,660, while Kajima lost 40 to 1,950.
   London share prices posted hefty losses at the close of
trading, as the worsening outlook for U.K. corporate profits
and the continued spate of company downgradings by analysts
have taken center stage.
   The market started the session easier and continued its
descent. When Wall Street also reversed its recent trend and
shares softened throughout the London afternoon session, the
London market took its cue from that drop and ended mostly in
the red.
   But volume was relatively poor, with 386.8 million shares
changing hands. This was only slightly above Wednesday's 353
million shares, when the U.S. market was closed for
Independence Day.
   Traders said it was too soon to tell whether the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was establishing a new,
lower trading range, but they conceded that negative
sentiment is mounting.
   The 100-index ended down 24.1 points at 2331.4. At the
day's low the index was down 27.7 points. The intraday high
was reached just after the start of official trading, when
the index was 3.3 points easier.
   The narrower FT-SE 30-share index ended down 22.9 points
at 1858.2.
   In the futures market, the September FT-SE 100-share index
was quoted at 2393.0, down from its close Wednesday of
2424.0.
   Shares to post large losses included Pearson, down 16
pence (28 cents) at 768, and RMC, down 24 at 665.
   P&amp;O continued to suffer from Wednesday's downgrading by
James Capel, ending down 11 pence at 617. Reckitt &amp; Colman
also continued its descent, following its profit warning
earlier in the week, ending down 21 pence at #1,244 pence
($22.09).
   The only sector to show gains was the retail banks. One
dealer said this was largely due to continued rumors of a
merger between Midland and its 14.9% shareholder, HongKong &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corp. A dealer with County Natwest Woodmac,
which issued a buy recommendation for Midland Wednesday, said
the firm was convinced the merger would take place within
12-18 months.
   Midland ended up 8 pence at 303.
   The entire banking sector benefited from the talk, but the
sector appears to be generally undergoing an upward move
after its recent underperformance on debt worries.
   National Westminster ended up 2 at 322, while Barclays was
up 4 at 391. Lloyds closed 6 higher at 287.
   Share prices closed higher in Stockholm, lower in Paris,
Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam and Madrid, and mixed
in Milan. South African gold stocks were lower.
   Share prices closed higher in Sydney, Singapore and
Manila, were mixed in Wellington and lower in Hongkong,
Taipei and Seoul.

   SEC Staff Ruling Gives Accounting Firms
   More Leeway to Consult for Audit Clients
   ----
   By Robin Goldwyn Blumenthal
   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

ACCOUNTING (ACC)

<GV>
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
</GV>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission's staff
has opened the door a little wider for accounting firms to do
more consulting work for their auditing clients.
   The SEC staff ruled that Arthur Andersen could do
consulting work for a client it audits because the accounting
firm had separated its auditing and consulting businesses,
avoiding a potential conflict of interest. Although the
decision doesn't alter existing rules regarding auditors'
independence, it could have broad implications for other
accounting firms, which increasingly have been doing
consulting work as part of their overall business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling came in response to a request by Arthur
Andersen to have the relationship between its auditing
clients and Andersen Consulting be considered indirect and
therefore allowable. The Andersen consulting business, which
previously was part of the accounting firm, was separated
last year in a restructuring under which they both report to
a parent firm in Switzerland, Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. S.C.
Andersen, of all the big U.S. accounting firms, has the
largest consulting business, with about 40% of the world-wide
company's revenue coming from consulting. For most other big
U.S. accounting firms, consulting work accounts for between
15% and 25% of overall revenue.
   The ruling probably will increase competition for
consulting contracts between accounting firms and firms that
derive their business solely from consulting, which often
involves computer systems networks. And it comes at a time
when accountants are being criticized for not being tough
enough on some of their auditing clients, particularly in
light of the savings and loan crisis. Some critics wonder
whether the ruling will only further impair the independence
of auditors.
   The ruling represents "another barrier falling" between
the traditional separation of accounting and consulting, said
David Lord, managing editor of Consultants News, a trade
publication. "For the purists in this field, it's an absolute
outrage."
   The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
the major professional body for U.S. accountants, recently
effectively allowed its members to accept contingent fees and
commissions from non-audit clients, which softened the
division between auditing and consulting. In that case, an
accountant might recommend a client purchase a financial
instrument to improve a company's health, then take a
commission on the advice.
   In its ruling, the SEC staff concluded that as a result of
Andersen's restructuring, business relationships between
Andersen Consulting and auditing clients of Arthur Andersen
wouldn't violate independence rules for accountants as long
as the individual contract relationships have no material
effect on any of the parties. The standard for what
constitutes "material" is subject to interpretation, but it
is generally regarded as having a "significant" effect on net
income.
   The ruling represents somewhat of a turnabout for the SEC,
which rejected a similar petition by Andersen and two other
firms in December 1988. But the latest Andersen petition
"represented a different set of facts," said Edmund Coulson,
chief accountant of the SEC. Mr. Coulson said that Andersen
"undertook a fairly significant change" in the way it does
business because of the restructuring, and that influenced
the latest ruling.
   The existing SEC rules on independence prohibit direct or
materially indirect business relationships between an auditor
and its clients. Accounting firms have maintained that doing
consulting work for their auditing clients doesn't impair
their independence, and that audit and consulting functions
are kept at arm's length, said Arthur W. Bowman, editor of
Bowman's Accounting Report. Accounting firms had circumvented
the rules by avoiding certain relationships expressly
prohibited.
   Mr. Bowman said that last year, although about 88% of the
Andersen accounting firm's clients didn't use the firm for
consulting work, about 23% of the consulting firm's business
came from auditing clients, and that may happen more as a
result of the ruling. In its fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 1989,
before the restructuring, Andersen derived $1.94 billion of
revenue from accounting, auditing and tax work and $1.44
billion of revenue from consulting work.
   The ruling "is great for the accounting profession, and
makes it easier to generate cross-selling revenue," Mr.
Bowman said.
   Indeed, the ruling will "reduce a lot of concerns among
audit clients who have not been able to joint venture with
our consulting arm," said Lawrence Weinbach, managing partner
and chief executive of the Arthur Andersen parent company.
   The SEC's Mr. Coulson declined to predict whether other
firms would follow Andersen's lead in restructuring. Although
Mr. Weinbach said he expected other accounting firms would
have to "seriously look at their structure" in the wake of
the ruling, he said the Andersen restructuring didn't occur
because of the SEC's previous rejection of its petition. The
two other accounting firms that joined Andersen in the
earlier petition declined to comment.
   The latest ruling comes amid a larger study of auditors'
independence being conducted by the SEC. The study arose in
part from efforts of major accounting firms to ease some of
the conflict-of-interest rules for auditors in joint ventures
with clients, including the narrower issue examined in the
Andersen case.
   The ruling is "interesting" because it may be "charting a
new course in the area of independence," said Gary Previts,
professor of accountancy at Case Western Reserve University
in Cleveland. "Materiality isn't so much the issue as is the
objectivity that exists not only in the mind of the auditor
but in the eyes of society," Prof. Previts said.

   Northern Telecom Ltd., in a continuing effort to
streamline operations, said it will close a small
manufacturing facility in St. John, New Brunswick, by
November.
   The facility, which employs 122 people and has been
operating since 1945, manufactures inductors and transformers
used in older technology telecommunications equipment. The
shutdown will bring to four the number of facilities
Toronto-based Northern has closed since 1988.

   "The business for those parts {made in St. John} has gone
away as the technology changed," a spokesman said. "Some
production will be absorbed into locations where we have
overcapacity."
   He said some workers can try out for sales positions in a
new customer center Northern plans to open in St. John by
year end. For employees who don't stay, Northern has set
aside $5 million, most of which will be used for severance
pay and to aid relocation and retraining.

   NEW YORK -- Despite his troubled finances, real estate and
casino developer Donald Trump made a multimillion-dollar
property tax payment yesterday as requested by the city, a
spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said.
   "It was paid in full," the spokeswoman said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   New York City officials had asked the owners of more than
400 of the biggest real estate parcels in New York to make a
total of $1.1 billion in payments by midnight yesterday.
   The semiannual payments are normally due July 1, but
because of delays in passing the city budget, the deadline
was pushed back to July 5 for utilities and other properties
valued at more than $15 million.
   Among other assets, Trump owed $2.2 million on a 76-acre
former railroad yard on Manhattan's West Side, $1 million on
the commercial section of Trump Tower and $900,000 on the
Trump Parc condominiums, according to the New York City
Department of Finance.
   Trump last month escaped default on $351 million of bonds
issued for his Atlantic City, N.J., casinos by winning a bank
loan agreement and $20 million in fresh funds. The loan
allowed him to make a crucial overdue interest payment.
   Trump had negotiated for weeks with his bankers in an
effort to obtain a $65 million loan but ran into opposition
from some lenders who did not want to participate in the new
package. In the end, seven banks agreed in principle to lend
the larger sum and released $20 million immediately.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Placer Dome Inc. said it
raised its stake in Stikine Resources Ltd. to just 45.3% from
45%, under an extended 67.50 Canadian dollar (US$58.09) a
share tender offer that expired late Wednesday.
   The bid result leaves control of Stikine, half-owner of
British Columbia's rich Eskay Creek gold project, undecided.
Placer Dome's spokesman said a 6.1% block of Stikine shares
that a Toronto arbitrage firm disclosed it held last month
wasn't tendered to the offer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're examining our options," in light of the bid
results, the spokesman said. "We need to knock on some doors
to try to pry loose" the remaining Stikine shares, he said.
   Placer Dome's rival, Toronto-based Corona Corp., owns 3%
of Stikine and has agreed to acquire a further 42% of the
company from its principal shareholders. Pending regulatory
approval, Corona further plans an offer to acquire all
Stikine shares that aren't held by Placer Dome.
   Corona currently owns a 34% voting stake in Prime
Resources Group Inc., Stikine's Eskay Creek partner.
   Placer Dome and Corona, both major gold producers, have
been battling for control of Eskay Creek, though Corona said
earlier this week it will pursue talks with Placer Dome that
could lead to joint ownership of the gold property. Placer
Dome's spokesman said it would "look favorably" on talks with
Corona.
   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Stikine
closed at C$71 a share, up C$1. Placer Dome's shares closed
at C$18.25 each, down 37.5 Canadian cents, and Corona's Class
A shares closed at C$7.375 each, down 25 cents.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Dismissed Saatchi Executives Plan
   To Counter With Their Own Firm

   LONDON -- Two top Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. executives
dismissed in May intend to buy or set up their own ad agency,
posing a potential competitive threat to the troubled
communications giant.
   "We are still in the formative and design stage" for the
would-be business, said Terry Bannister, ousted along with
Roy Warman as joint chief executive officers of the company's
advertising operations after a boardroom power struggle. "But
in all probability, it will be in London" and will begin
operations by year end, he said in a telephone interview
yesterday. The pair had considered becoming ad industry
consultants, Mr. Bannister said, but "you don't only want to
make the bullets. You want to fire them as well."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Robert Louis-Dreyfus, Saatchi's new chief executive
officer, fired the two men after attempting to demote them by
slashing their corporate responsibilities. Messrs. Bannister
and Warman were expected to receive contract settlements of
roughly #1.25 million ($2.22 million) apiece that also would
exclude them from the British advertising industry for four
years. Each was earning about #345,000 a year before
Saatchi's directors voted them a 10% pay cut earlier this
year. Each executive had almost four years left on a
five-year contract.
   Mr. Bannister said the two now hope to complete a
settlement with Saatchi by the end of July giving them the
freedom to operate an agency. They likely will receive
smaller severance packages, continue as Saatchi consultants
and accept fairly loose limits on recruiting Saatchi clients
and staffers. "We are moving forward with an agreement in
principle with the company that's now being crafted by the
lawyers," Mr. Bannister said.
   The accord would prevent the ex-Saatchi executives from
soliciting any current Saatchi advertising business "that we
have been in charge of and highly influential over," he said.
That prohibition might cover only parts of the world-wide
Saatchi empire, Mr. Bannister noted. And it wouldn't prevent
Saatchi clients from switching as long as the pair didn't
actively recruit them.
   Indeed, similar restrictions didn't stop one Saatchi
client from awarding an approximately #1.25 million account
yesterday to a breakaway shop formed in May by seven former
officials of Saatchi's flagship London advertising agency.
Reckitt &amp; Colman PLC, a British consumer-products concern,
said it chose Cowan, Kemsley, Taylor Ltd. to handle
everything but media buying for its U.K. household-cleaner
brand Dettox.
   In the same way, any new agency created by Messrs. Warman
and Bannister might lure unhappy staffers from Saatchi's
London agency, Britain's largest, which they once ran.
"There's always the threat that other disaffected people
within Saatchi might find the opportunity {attractive} of
joining Roy and Terry in a new agency {rather} than toughing
it out at Charlotte Street," the London agency's nickname,
suggested David Forster, an advertising analyst at U.K.
brokers Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. "There's a
danger that {Saatchi} would lose people as well as business."
   A Saatchi spokesman said the company continues to
negotiate a severance package with Messrs. Warman and
Bannister, but declined to comment about details. He also
dismissed the loss of the Dettox account, saying, "it's not
terribly significant anyway."

   Boyle Brands Moved
                                                                                                       

   Reckitt &amp; Colman, following its acquisition of American
Home Products's Boyle Midway unit, pulled its newly acquired
brands from Young &amp; Rubicam and McCann-Erickson and placed
them at a number of smaller shops.
   Wayne, N.J.-based Reckitt &amp; Colman, a unit of Reckitt &amp;
Colman PLC, said its ad budget, which includes a number of
brands that aren't switching agencies, totals more than $40
million. A spokesman refused to say how much the brands it is
moving will bill separately.
   TBWA Advertising was perhaps the biggest winner, picking
up the Woolite and Neet brands. According to Leading National
Advertisers, a tracking firm, Woolite billed about $13
million last year; Neet billed about $2 million.
   Bloom Agency, a unit of Bloom Cos., picked up Easy Off
oven cleaner, which spent about $3 million in 1989, and two
other small brands. Campbell-Mithun-Esty, a unit of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, won Wizard air fresheners; Partners &amp; Shevack picked
up the Holiday insecticide line.
   Bloom, C-M-E and Partners &amp; Shevack already handle other
Reckitt &amp; Colman accounts. The company spokesman said the
changes reflected a desire to consolidate its advertising at
fewer shops.
   McCann-Erickson, an Interpublic Group agency, had Easy Off
and also a large chunk of the Woolite business. Young &amp;
Rubicam had part of the Woolite account, as well as Neet,
Wizard and a number of other small brands. It continues to
handle American Home's Pam and Butter Buds brands.

   SAN MATEO, Calif. -- Five members of a dissident
shareholder group have been elected to two separate boards of
companies that own and operate the Bay Meadows race track.
   The California Jockey Club elected Marilyn K. Gunderson
and Richard E. Perrazo as board members. Bay Meadows
Operating Co. named Grant G. Gunderson, Doris L. Johnson, and
Louis J. Poletti to its board. Both boards have six members.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dissidents replace a slate of management-appointed
directors, but didn't win enough seats in a May election to
control either of the boards. The shareholder group, which
holds a stake in California Jockey Club, has complained that
the companies placed too much emphasis on real estate
operations at the expense of running the race track.
   A spokesman for California Jockey said that the new
directors hadn't yet made any demands of management. The
California Jockey Club is one of three publicly traded real
estate investment trusts whose primary asset is a horse track
here; Bay Meadows Operating is a publicly traded concern that
oversees track operations.

   SYDNEY -- Arco Coal Australia Inc. said it reached
tentative agreement with a number of Japanese and European
steelmakers for the purchase of coal from a proposed new mine
near Emerald in the state of Queensland.
   Production capacity at the proposed Gordonstone
underground mine is about four million metric tons a year
with reserves of about 900 million tons, said Arco Coal
Australia, a unit of Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Development of the mine would cost about 500 million
Australian dollars (US$399 million) and take more than two
years, Arco Coal Australia estimated. The company has a 65.5%
interest in Gordonstone. Suncorp, controlled by the
Queensland government, has a 29.5% stake and Lend Lease Corp.
of Australia has the remaining 5% interest.
   Ian Knight, managing director of Gordonstone Coal
Management Pty. Ltd., the venture that would develop the
mine, said a memorandum of understanding has been reached
with Japanese steelmakers for a five-year coal shipment
beginning in 1992 and rising to an annual rate of 1.2 million
tons in the third year. The company also has purchase
agreements with some Western European government-owned
enterprises, he said.
   The venture still needs various Australian government
approvals and approval from Atlantic Richfield's board of
directors. "It's on the agenda for the last week of this
month," said a spokesman for Arco's Coal division in Denver.
Arco Coal Australia is making agreements with customers
before a final decision is reached to proceed with developing
the mine.

   NEW YORK -- A federal judge in Manhattan dismissed an
insider trading suit against Loomis, Sayles &amp; Co., an
investment affiliate of New England Mutual Life Insurance Co.
   The suit alleged that the investment company sold its
12.6% stake in Texas Air Corp., or about 5.3 million shares,
on Jan. 24 based on insider knowledge. The next day, Eastern
Air Lines, one of Texas Air's two carriers, met with
unsecured creditors to outline a reorganization plan under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, the lawsuit
contended. Details of the plan were disclosed that same day,
causing the stock price to drop.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The lawsuit, filed at the end of January by a Texas Air
shareholder, was immediately called "frivolous" and "absurd"
by New England Mutual executives. Charles L. Finlayson,
general counsel at Loomis, said that G. Kenneth Heebner, then
Loomis's investment manager, had decided to sell the Texas
Air stock because increased competition led him to reduce his
earnings estimates for the airline. Mr. Finlayson said Mr.
Heebner began selling the stock at least six weeks before the
final block of about 3.4 million shares was sold on Jan. 24.
   Last Monday, attorneys for the shareholder, Frank Debora,
filed a stipulation of dismissal with Judge Kevin Thomas
Duffy of U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Judge Duffy
approved the dismissal yesterday.
   "I'm just satisfied that it has been put behind us," said
Loomis's Mr. Finlayson. "The suit should never have been
filed in the first place."

   Millipore Corp. said sales from its continuing lines of
business grew 12% in the second quarter compared with the
year-ago period, while sales in the first half grew 11% from
a year earlier.
   Millipore said the growth rates exclude results from its
process water division, which was sold in November.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Including results from the process water division,
Millipore said, sales growth was 4% over the year-ago quarter
and 3% over the year-earlier six months. Had currency
exchange rates remained constant in 1989 and 1990, Millipore
said, its growth rate, excluding results for the sold
division, would have been 10% for both the quarter and first
half.
   For the 1989 second quarter, Millipore had net income of
$13.5 million, or 48 cents a share, on sales of $167 million.
For the first half, Millipore had net income of $25.9
million, or 93 cents a share, on sales of $327.8 million.
   Millipore, a Bedford, Mass., analytical and purification
products concern, will release its second quarter results
later this month.

   For investors in stock mutual funds, the message from the
past three months is: Caution didn't pay.
   By venturing abroad or loading up on stocks of companies
with fast-growing earnings, some funds picked up handsome
returns for the quarter. But conservative fund managers who
sat on cash found themselves sitting out a rally.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Growth funds and small-company growth funds both had total
returns -- price change plus dividends -- of more than 7% for
the quarter, according to Lipper Analytical Services. The
average general stock fund returned 5.89% for the quarter
while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock Index rose 6.29%.
   The quarter's gains were an abrupt turnaround from the
first quarter, when the average stock fund slipped 2.31% and
the plodding money market funds ranked as the second-best
performing category of mutual funds.
   "Investors are looking for companies that have
above-average earnings growth," says Gordon Fines, manager of
the $800 million IDS Growth Fund. The economy is sluggish,
but "inflation isn't a problem and interest rates are stable.
Against that sort of benign backdrop, investors are drawn to
growth stocks."
   Mr. Fines's fund was up 16.45% for the past three months,
helped by both big-company growth stocks such as Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and Waste Management Inc. as well as smaller
growth stocks including Flightsafety International Inc.,
Adobe Systems Inc. and Novell Inc.
   According to A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper
Analytical, funds that bought growth stocks -- whether they
were big company growth stocks or small company growth stocks
-- were the big winners in the quarter. "It paid to assume
risk," notes Mr. Lipper. "Growth is back, and high growth is
back even more."
   Among general domestic stock funds, small-company growth
funds were the top performers for the second consecutive
quarter. But after seven years of lagging behind the market
averages, most small-cap managers aren't yet ready to uncork
the champagne.
   "It's not size that's done it, it's growth," says Roy
McKay, manager of Scudder Development Fund, a small-company
stock fund that was up 16.36% over the past three months.
"It's the growth that's doing well. Companies with
consistently growing earnings have done well."
   Not all stock fund managers are cheering. Many fund
managers missed part of the rally because they were holding
too much cash. As a result, over the past three months the
average fund trailed the market by 0.4 percentage point. Very
conservative fund managers did even worse. The equity income
funds were up just 2.6%.
   It's been rough going for some highly regarded fund
managers. Mario Gabelli, who pulled in assets of $1.1 billion
when he launched the broker-sold Gabelli Value Fund in
September, was up just 1.41% in the second quarter. Mutual
Shares and Windsor Fund, both of which trailed the market
badly in 1989, continued to struggle. Michael Price's Mutual
Shares was up 2.51% in the quarter, while John Neff's Windsor
eked out a gain of 1.37%.
   Just as the riskier stock funds did well in the second
quarter, so too did the riskier bond funds, notes Mr. Lipper.
Bond funds that hold longer maturity bonds did well, and
high-yielding junk bond funds snapped their yearlong losing
streak. Junk funds were down 5.57% for the past 12 months,
and the list of the 25 poorest performing mutual funds now
includes 11 junk funds. But for the most recent quarter, junk
funds bounced back 4.1%.
   International stock funds, which invest outside the U.S.,
outstripped their domestic counterparts over the past three
months. Though funds that invest in the Pacific region -- and
especially Japan -- bounced back smartly in the second
quarter, the hottest international funds this year have been
those investing in Europe.
   Oppenheimer Global, which is up 13.7% this year, has 75%
of its assets invested in Europe. "We emphasize `theme'
areas," explains fund manager Kenneth Oberman. "Our theme
areas are not very sophisticated. They're mostly things on
the front page of the newspaper rather than the back page of
the business section." Mr. Oberman says he was attracted to
European companies by such themes as the 1992 economic
integration of Europe, perestroika and the long-run rise in
spending on health care.
   Among specialty funds, the past three months were
particularly kind to funds investing in technology, health
care and biotechnology. Gold funds were the biggest losers in
the quarter, down 10.27%, and the list of the
second-quarter's poorest 25 performers includes 23 precious
metals funds.
   Daniel Leonard enjoys the dubious distinction of managing
one of the quarter's best performing funds, Financial
Strategic Portfolios-Technology, and one of the poorest
performers, Financial Strategic Portfolios-Gold.
   On the technology front, "we've been in the tank for seven
years," says Mr. Leonard. "We've had a nice move, but the
stocks are still at pretty attractive price-earnings ratios."
Technology stocks, after performing well all year, took a
beating at the end of May, but he says the group now is
starting to rebound.
   "The software stocks were particularly rewarding during
the quarter," notes Mr. Leonard, who thinks software
companies such as Electronic Arts and Software Toolworks Inc.
should continue to perform well for the rest of the year.
   As for gold, Mr. Leonard is pessimistic about the metal's
price. "The two reasons you want to own gold," he says, "are
inflation and uncertainty in the world." Mr. Leonard sees
little reason for enthusiasm on either count.
   So where has Mr. Leonard got his money? "I've got it in
technology," says Mr. Leonard the investor. "I expect it'll
stay there for a while."

   Amdura Corp. said a federal district court approved the
sale of assets in its subsidiary Coast to Coast Stores Inc.,
to Servistar Corp., a dealer-owned hardware cooperative based
in Butler, Pa.
   The Coast to Coast unit sells hardware to individually
owned retail stores operating under the Coast to Coast
franchise. The asset sale will include inventory, two
distribution centers and such intangibles as the Coast to
Coast trademark. The sale, expected to close within 35 days,
is being valued by the companies between $59 million and $75
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Amdura, a Denver-based automotive and hardware distributor
and specialty manufacturer, bought CoastAmerica Corp., the
parent company of Coast to Coast Stores, only two years ago.
But the resulting debt of more than $260 million proved to be
more than Amdura could handle, forcing it this past April to
seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Approximately 1,100 stores are involved in the sale.
According to the sales agreement, they will operate as a
separate unit of Servistar.
   An Amdura spokesman also acknowledged that the company is
still soliciting bids for Amdura National Distributing Co.,
another hardware distributor, but declined to further
comment.

   Sony Corp. of Japan plans to increase purchases of
European-made semiconductors, in line with its target to
boost the ratio of foreign-made chips in its products to 20%
by July 1991, a spokesman said.
   Japanese consumer electronics makers have been increasing
their foreign chip purchases, in efforts to meet the target
set in a five-year agreement between the U.S. and Japan to
raise the overall share of foreign chips sold in Japan to 20%
of the market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The exact nature of the agreement, which ends in July
1991, is a matter of dispute, with the U.S. claiming that
Japan pledged to meet the 20% goal and Japan saying it only
promised to make efforts to reach the target.
   The proportion of foreign-made chips purchased in June by
Sony was between 15% and 16% of its total chip needs, most of
which were U.S.-made, the spokesman said.

   First Executive Chairman
   Took Big Pay Cut in 1989

   LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp.'s chairman and chief
executive officer, Fred Carr, saw his 1989 compensation drop
nearly as drastically as the junk-bond market did last year,
taking a toll on the life insurance holding company.
   The company's newly issued proxy statement for its annual
meeting July 30 shows that Mr. Carr received cash
compensation of $604,734 in 1989, or roughly a third of the
$1.8 million he received in 1988. The 1988 sum included $1.25
million in deferred incentive compensation in addition to a
base salary of $600,000, according to last year's proxy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A new employment contract signed in December provides,
among other things, that Mr. Carr would receive $6 million in
cash or three times his base salary and average incentive pay
for the two preceeding years, if he resigns under certain
conditions following a change in control at the company.
   The filing further states that First Executive, once a key
client of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., bought about $2.35
billion and sold about $1.1 billion in securities through
Drexel last year before the firm's collapse. It also holds
about $19 million of commercial paper issued by Drexel that
is in default.
   Executive Life, First Executive's operating unit, sued
Drexel to recover part of the unpaid first-quarter rent on
office space in Beverly Hills, Calif., that it sublet to the
brokerage firm. In May, Drexel paid Executive Life $400,000
to settle the suit, the filing shows.

   Abreast of the Market:
   Rally Is Snapped by Profit-Taking,
   Rounds of Futures-Related Selling

   NEW YORK -- The stock market decisively broke its longest
winning streak in two months, as prices finished broadly and
sharply lower in light, post-holiday trading.
   Profit-taking in advance of today's release of June
employment data, coupled with several rounds of
futures-related selling, sent the Dow Jones Industrial
Average tumbling 32.42 points to 2879.21. This was the
largest decline since June 22, when the Dow industrials
slipped more than 44.35 points.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   News that aides to President Bush are considering a
possible tax of as much as 0.5% on securities sales
"overshadowed the market," said Richard Meyer, head of
institutional trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. Though
traders refused to attribute the market's decline solely to
the tax issue, they said some big institutions now will
increase hedges on stock positions by selling futures, for
example, to insulate portfolios from the day-to-day swings
that might come from Washington's tax debate.
   Prices had finished higher in each of the previous five
sessions, with the Dow industrials gaining a total of 69.30
points, or 2.4%, in that period. The performance was the
market's best since the average posted seven consecutive
advances in a late April-early May rally.
   Traders reported little demand to support prices, because
many institutional investors remained on vacation after the
July Fourth holiday.
   Also, uncertainty about the outcome of today's employment
report kept buyers on the sidelines. Though the June data is
generally expected to show a modest pickup in job creation,
some expect to see signs of economic weakness, which could
prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.
   The report is expected to show that nonfarm payrolls rose
83,000 overall and went up 132,000 after excluding the
layoffs of temporary census workers, according to a consensus
of economists polled by Dow Jones. Payrolls rose 164,000 in
May, but the hiring of census takers accounted for 145,000 of
the increase.
   Declining stocks routed advancers on the New York Stock
Exchange by 1,058 to 397.
   The breadth of the sell-off also could be seen in the
declines in broad averages. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index fell 4.48 to 355.68, the Dow Jones Equity Market Index
lost 3.69 to 331.03, and the New York Stock Exchange
composite index tumbled 2.16 to 194.45.
   Big Board volume dropped to 128,320,000 shares from
130,050,000 shares on Tuesday.
   The "mediocre up market" of the past five sessions gave
way to "some profit-takers, ready to cash in" after the
advance, said David Holt, director of technical research at
Wedbush Morgan Securities, Los Angeles.
   At least four rounds of sell programs tied to stock-index
arbitrage hit the market during the session, putting further
pressure on share prices. The first two flurries struck
within the first half-hour of trading, when the Dow
industrials dropped more than 23 points.
   The market's leaders over the course of its rally-growth
stocks and consumer issues with a history of steady earnings
improvement -- weren't spared from the sell-off. Philip
Morris dropped 1/2 to 47 1/2 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading of 1.7 million shares, Merck dropped 1 1/2
to 86 1/8, Coca-Cola went down 5/8 to 44 1/4 and General
Electric slid 7/8 to 70 1/4 on slightly more than one million
shares.
   Auto stocks were hit especially hard, even though
late-June sales reports showed that U.S. car sales climbed to
their highest levels since February. General Motors fell 1
1/8 to 47 1/4 and Ford Motor slid 1 to 44, while Chrysler
eased 1/4 to 15 1/4.
   Avon Products placed first on the Big Board's list of most
active issues, as the result of a block trade of 3.98 million
shares, or 7% of the Avon shares outstanding. Chartwell
Associates bought the block from a partnership of the
investor Irwin Jacobs and Amway. Chartwell said its partners,
who include the investor Gordon Getty and the Fisher brothers
of New York, plan to buy an additional 1.2 million Avon
shares from the Jacobs-Amway partnership within the next 30
days. The stock lost 3/4 to 37 on composite volume of 4.7
million shares.
   Panhandle Eastern fell 2 1/8 to 21 3/8, on 1.4 million
shares, reflecting speculation that the company may reduce
its dividend as a result of lower-than-expected natural gas
prices and its heavy debt load from its acquisition last year
of Texas Eastern. Panhandle, which previously said it
wouldn't lower the annual dividend of $2 a share, declined to
comment on the latest talk, but said its board "is expected
to thoroughly review" the payout policy at its July 25
meeting.
   Genentech went up 1/2 to 29, on 1.2 million shares, and
Eli Lilly gained 1 1/2 to 86 1/4, following the release of a
study that found that elderly men can benefit from regular
injections of human growth hormone, produced by both
companies. Researchers in Wisconsin found that the drug can
reverse atrophying of muscles and increases in fat tissue.
   Another drug stock that avoided being caught in the
market's sell-off was Rorer Group, which rose 1 to 72 5/8.
Standard &amp; Poor's upgraded ratings on Rorer's debt issues to
reflect the company's planned merger with Rhone-Poulenc of
France.
   Gulf States Utilities added 1/8 to 11. Moody's Investors
Service placed its ratings on the company's long-term debt
and preferred stock under review for a possible upgrade,
citing Gulf States' tentative agreement to resolve a dispute
about power purchases from Southern Co.
   British Steel dropped 7/8 to 24 3/8, on 2.6 million
shares, with a set of dividend-related trades by institutions
accounting for the bulk of the volume. The stock has a 5.1%
dividend yield, and stock of record tomorrow will receive the
next quarterly payout.
   McDonnell Douglas climbed 1 7/8 to 40 7/8, amid
indications the U.S. and South Korean governments have
resolved differences that had blocked a proposed sale of the
company's F/A-18 fighters to South Korea.
   Motel Six, buoyed by recent speculation that Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts may sell its 53% stake in the partnership,
went up 1/2 to 17 7/8 in active trading. KKR declined to
comment on its plans.
   HomeFed fell 1 1/4 to 19 5/8, but closed well above its
intraday low of 18. The bounce came after Merrill Lynch
upgraded its short-term investment rating on the stock to
"hold" from "below average," citing its drop in price.
   Waban gained 3/8 to 8 1/8 and Circuit City Stores added
1/4 to 26 7/8, after releasing June sales reports. Waban's
sales rose 19% from a year earlier, and sales at Circuit City
rose 23% overall and 6% for stores open at least one year.
   Tootsie Roll Industries gained 1 1/8 to 48 3/8, setting a
52-week high for the third consecutive session. Prescott,
Ball &amp; Turben featured the stock in the latest monthly issue
of Investor News, a newsletter sent to the firm's clients on
Monday. Elliott Schlang, an analyst, said his price target
for Tootsie Roll over the next six months is $52 a share.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 2.18
to 358.49. Amex volume totaled about 8,520,000 shares,
compared with about 11,730,000 a day earlier. Declining
issues outnumbered those advancing, 321 to 216, and 234
finished unchanged.

   Massachusetts Moves

   BOSTON (AP) -- A conference committee of the Massachusetts
Senate and House approved an increased income tax and a sales
tax on some services to help reduce the state budget deficit
estimated at about $1 billion.
   The proposed tax increases still must be approved by both
the House and Senate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 5% sales tax on services -- opposed strongly by
various business groups -- was modified by the conference
committee. It would apply to fees charged by lawyers,
architects, engineers and accountants, and to commercial
electric and gas use, telecommunications, credit-reporting
services and graphic design, among others.
   The sales tax wouldn't apply until a threshold of $20,000
a year in fees per customer was reached.
   Under the plan endorsed by the conference committee, the
income tax, now 5.75%, would rise retroactively to 5.95%
initially then would rise to 6.25% for the fiscal year that
began July 1, and then would drop back to 5.95% in 1992.
   Even with the tax increases, legislators estimated that
the state still will have to cut spending to balance its
$13.6 billion budget. Massachusetts has the lowest general
obligation bond rating in the nation because of its financial
problems.

   Commodities:
   Oil Prices Slip as Norwegian Wildcat Strike Fades;
   Gasoline Falls on Signs of Higher Refiner Output

   Oil prices tumbled as wildcat strikes in Norway's offshore
oil fields began to fizzle.
   Expectations that strikers would continue to defy a
back-to-work order from their union and the Norwegian
government faded as strike activity in the huge Ekofisk oil
field came to an end. Reports that there were still pockets
of resistance at other installations, however, prompted a
brief rally shortly before trading ended.

<TEXT>
   Crude oil for August delivery slipped 30 cents to $16.50 a
barrel in light trading, with many market participants taking
an extended holiday after Wednesday's Independence Day
closing.
   Heating oil and gasoline prices also were lower as weekly
statistics showed that refineries are beginning to increase
their output of petroleum products.
   If the Norwegian strikes end, it will be up to the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to prop up the
price of oil. There are indications that Kuwait, which is
demanding a higher quota despite a global oil glut, might
relax its stance until the price for the OPEC basket of
crudes approaches the cartel's goal of $18 a barrel. It
currently stands at only slightly more than $14 a barrel.
   There also were reports that OPEC leaders might be trying
to define a strategy that would accommodate Kuwait's desire
to produce more than its current daily quota of 1.5 million
barrels.
   The oil ministers of Kuwait and Indonesia ended two days
of meetings with acting OPEC President Sadek Boussena in
Algiers yesterday. Mr. Boussena has been appealing to OPEC
leaders to put aside their individual needs until higher
prices are re-established.
   If he has persuaded the Kuwaitis to be more flexible, "it
would be a surprising switch in policy possibly meaning more
harmony within the cartel and maybe higher oil prices," said
Nauman Barakat, first vice president for international energy
futures at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   In one bearish development, however, the International
Energy Agency reported that OPEC pumped 23.2 million barrels
a day in June. And there is little likelihood that production
will decline much below 23 million barrels a day even if the
cartel, at its July 25 meeting, reaffirms its daily
production quota of 22 million barrels.
   However, demand for oil can be expected to rise in the
third and fourth quarters, which might make a production
level of 23 million barrels a day more acceptable, analysts
say.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Forecasts of an end to a relatively
brief Midwest heat wave drove corn and soybean futures prices
lower. Temperatures approached 100 degrees Fahrenheit early
this week in Iowa and some surrounding states, but private
meteorologists are predicting cooler temperatures and rain
across much of the region. Corn for December delivery settled
at $2.805 a bushel, down its daily limit of 10 cents. An
initial price plunge triggered heavy selling by
trend-following commodity funds and other speculators, all
but ensuring that futures prices would remain depressed for
the rest of the session, analysts said. Richard Dennis, one
of the most active speculators in grain futures contracts on
the Chicago Board of Trade, was widely rumored by analysts to
have been the largest single seller of December corn futures.
As a matter of policy, the reclusive futures trader declines
to comment on his activity. Soybeans for July delivery
settled at $6.2850 a bushel, down 20 cents.
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Prices swung wildly. The July contract ended three
cents a pound higher at 92.80 cents after trading as high as
93.90 cents. The October contract, which reflects both the
current crop and the next crop year, finished at 80.74 cents
a pound, up 0.69 cent, after reaching a high of 82.05 cents.
The December contract, reflecting new-crop conditions, traded
as high as 77 cents a pound but ended at 75.62 cents, down
0.16 cent. Thomas Mueller, cotton specialist at Merrill Lynch
Futures in New York, said the July contract, which expires
Monday and now has no limit on price moves, helped lift
new-crop prices to life-of-contract highs early in the
session. Just before the close, however, selling developed in
these contracts. "I think profit-taking hit the market," Mr.
Mueller said. The July open interest, or number of contracts
remaining to be nullified by an opposite trade or fulfilled
by delivery of cotton, is well above 1,000, an unusually
large number this close to expiration, Mr. Mueller said.
However, he said, what little cotton there is around is going
into the higher-priced cash market and isn't being certified
for delivery against open futures contracts.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices were driven higher by speculation
about a tightening of supplies. Copper for September delivery
reached a life-of-contract high of $1.1695 a pound before
settling at $1.1605, up 2.95 cents from Tuesday. The most
significant news seemed to be a report of an explosion at one
of Chile's Codelco mines, El Teniente. Codelco is the world's
biggest copper producer. There also were rumors of labor
problems in the copper mines in Chile. David Threlkeld,
president of Threlkeld &amp; Co., a Vermont-based international
metals dealer, said copper companies might produce 350,000
metric tons less this year than users will demand. "And there
isn't 350,000 tons in stocks to be drawn down," he said. A
metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds. Mr. Threlkeld cautioned that
the demand estimate assumes there won't be a recession in the
U.S. He also said Codelco, which originally estimated its
production for the year at 1,290,000 metric tons, has reduced
that number by 100,000 tons. Mr. Threlkeld has estimated that
Codelco will produce only 1,050,000 metric tons. He also
estimates that the world used 120,000 metric tons more copper
in the first four months of the year than it produced.

   Mannesmann AG of West Germany said profit for the first
six months was "at the same good level of the year earlier,"
when the steel and engineering concern earned 179 million
marks ($108.5 million).
   Chairman Werner Dieter didn't specify first-half earnings
data, but told the annual meeting that sales climbed a
preliminary 8% to 11.1 billion marks from 10.26 billion marks
a year earlier. Excluding sales from Kraus-Maffei, in which
Mannesmann acquired a 71% stake late last year, sales climbed
only 2%, he said. A strong 1989 second half helped boost
annual profit 73% to 505 million marks, on a 9% rise in sales
to 22.3 billion marks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, Mannesmann said it plans to raise 724.6
million marks through a 1-for-10 issue of new shares. The
2,898,485 new shares, which will be entitled to half the 1990
dividend, will be offered to existing holders at a price of
250 marks apiece, a 30% discount from Mannesmann shares'
closing price yesterday of 360.50 marks on the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange. Mannesmann said the new capital will be used
for the company's further growth.

   Berisford International PLC reported that pretax profit
for the six months ended March 31 skidded 41% to #21.4
million ($38 million) from #36.4 million a year earlier, as
strong earnings in the British conglomerate's main sugar
operations failed to offset losses in its property, commodity
and financial services units.
   Profit before taxes, less minority interests and before
extraordinary items dropped 22% to #16.1 million from #20.8
million. The latest results included a #160.6 million
extraordinary loss, mostly from provisions against
investments in the declining New York property market;
year-earlier extraordinary losses totaled #38.5 million.
Earnings per share fell 23% to 3.3 pence from 4.3 pence. The
net loss attributable to shareholders, after taxes and
special items, widened to #144.5 million from #26.3 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales rose 10% to #998 million from #907 million.
   Berisford said that, given its weak financial position,

share.

   Heard on the Street:
   Carbide Attracts Some Admirers Despite Debt
   And Shaky Prices for Commodity Chemicals

   Union Carbide is still paying the price for escaping the
clutches of GAF Corp. in 1986. To avoid a takeover, Carbide
went deeply in debt to pay a huge special dividend. It also
sold its consumer products operations.
   Now Carbide is mainly a maker of commodity chemicals --
those made in large quantities by several manufacturers. The
company is caught in a cyclical downturn of
commodity-chemical prices and still bears a heavy, though
reduced, debt burden. Its shares, which briefly rose above 30
in 1987 and 1989, closed yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange at 19 1/8, down 1/4 from Tuesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   No question the stock is cheap. The question is whether
cheapness is enough. Carbide is selling for only eight times
estimated 1990 per-share earnings -- and a mere five times
the past 12 months' earnings. It yields just over 5% in
dividends.
   At these prices, Carbide is picking up some fans. Five
brokerage houses recommend it -- not a huge cheering section,
but the biggest in quite a while. "The stock is arguably as
cheap as it has ever been over the last 20 years," writes
John L. Garcia, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder. It could
double in two years, suggests Leslie Ravitz of Salomon
Brothers. And Sasho Dalov, editor of Wall Street Wire,
speculates that Carbide could be a takeover candidate.
   But others who follow the stock closely say that Carbide
is likely to stay cheap for at least a year or two. Earnings
are being hurt by world-wide oversupply of Carbide's mainstay
chemicals -- polyethylene (a common plastic) and ethylene
glycol (used in antifreeze and polyester fabric). Carbide's
profit is likely to fall to around $2.50 a share this year
from $3.92 last year, analysts say.
   That unfavorable outlook is already reflected in the stock
price. But William Young, an analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette, says it is too early to buy on fundamentals. The
balance between supply and demand for commodity chemicals
began worsening a little over a year ago, he says, and "that
down cycle tends to last more than one or two years."
   Mr. Ravitz of Salomon Brothers thinks Carbide should
appeal to patient investors. "Short-term, we don't think the
stock's going to do anything," he says. But "the downside is
moderate." Some time in the first half of 1991, he argues,
the stock market will begin anticipating a recovery in prices
of commodity chemicals.
   Carbide's other major division -- industrial gases -- is
growing faster than the chemicals-and-plastics division and
enjoys improving prices. Unfortunately, it has major
operations in Brazil, where an iron-handed anti-inflation
program crushed economic activity earlier this year. So the
industrial-gases division's 1990 results are expected to be
flat.
   Money managers and analysts have been hoping Carbide would
spin off the industrial-gases business or sell a minority
interest in it to the public to avoid the risk of a future
takeover. Their appetites were whetted last year when Carbide
set up separate divisions for its major business lines. But
this February, Carbide said that it had decided not to do a
spinoff or partial public offering.
   Among the disappointed parties was the T. Rowe Price
family of mutual funds, which had bought 600,000 shares early
this year. "We thought that management was beginning to take
actions to unlock the value" of the company, says Charlie
Ober, a T. Rowe Price analyst. "We have been unpleasantly
surprised that there hasn't been any follow-through."
   The lack of follow-through, some money managers think,
means Carbide no longer fears a takeover, now that such
activity has cooled. A Carbide spokesman declined to go
beyond the statement the company made in February or discuss
the company's stock price.
   Mr. Ravitz, for one, still has hopes. He thinks the
marketplace may bludgeon Carbide into action. "Before the
(February) announcement, the stock was at 24; now it's at
19," he says. He thinks Carbide could spin off its smallest
unit, the carbon products division.
   David A. Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset
Advisors in New York, says his firm won't buy Carbide because
of its debt load. Currently, total debt is more than half of
capital.
   He prefers rival chemical makers B.F. Goodrich and
Imperial Chemical Industries. With a good dose of revenue
from specialty chemicals, Goodrich enjoys better pricing. It
sells for about nine times the past 12 months' earnings and
yields 4.7%. London-based Imperial's output is about evenly
divided among commodity chemicals, specialty chemicals and
pharmaceuticals. ICI, based in London, produces
pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals as well as commodity
chemicals. It sells for less than 10 times earnings and
yields 5.9%.

to purchase most of the Chicago-based energy company's
so-called downstream, or refining and marketing, operations
in Britain by Aug. 1.
   The business included in the transaction would double
Elf's share of the British petroleum market, the company

along with a 70% effective interest in the 100,000

   Elf said the arrangement won't include Amoco's synthetic

Amoco units, such as Amoco U.K. Exploration Co. and Amoco
Chemical, also won't be affected by the sale.
   The purchase is part of Elf's strategy of reinforcing its
distribution network, after closing about 40% of its European
service stations in the past six years.

   Columbia S&amp;L Ex-Chief Spiegel Named
   In Administrative Charges by Regulators

<LP>
   Federal thrift regulators brought administrative charges
against Thomas Spiegel, the former chief executive officer of
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association, alleging a spending
spree with federally backed deposits and seeking a record $24
million in restitution and penalties.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision alleged that Mr. Spiegel
used funds from the Beverly Hills, Calif., thrift to pay for
European travel for him and his wife, a $55,000 gun
collection including Uzi submachine guns and automatic
pistols, $7,000 in tickets to a Michael Jackson concert, and
personal use of Columbia Savings aircraft and four resort
condominiums.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The thrift office said one of the condominiums, in Jackson
Hole, Wyo., was used almost exclusively by Michael Milken,
the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond chief who
pleaded guilty earlier this year to securities fraud, and his
brother, attorney Lowell Milken, without reimbursing
Columbia.
   As part of the restitution, the office is seeking $6.4
million from Mr. Spiegel for losses allegedly suffered by
Columbia in a partnership with Michael Milken that bought two
30-seat jets and built a luxury airplane hangar. Neither of
the Milken brothers was charged with any wrongdoing. Columbia
Savings bought several billion dollars of high-yield,
high-risk junk bonds from Drexel.
   In a statement, Mr. Spiegel said he was "outraged" at the
thrift office decision and forcefully denies all of the
charges. He said the office had refused to meet with his
attorneys to discuss the allegations and to give him a "fair
chance to respond."
   His statement continued: ". . . historically, OTS and its
predecessors have been abysmal failures and now, in panic and
for purely political reasons, OTS is seeking scapegoats to
divert public attention from its gross incompetence." Mr.
Spiegel is being represented by New York criminal defense
lawyer Robert Morvillo, who recently successfully defended
Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi against charges linked to
former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos.
   The case against Mr. Spiegel is an important one for the
thrift office. Not only was it initiated on the same day the
office announced a new policy of making such administrative
actions public, but it is the largest number of charges, the
largest restitution, and the largest civil fine ever sought
from an individual by the agency.
   Also, Congress, responding to constituents' outrage about
the costs of the S&amp;L bailout, is in a paroxysm of election
season denunciation of S&amp;L crime and will be watching the
case carefully. If the allegations are proven, Mr. Spiegel
would join the list of S&amp;L executives who have used thrifts
as personal piggy banks.
   Thrift office director Timothy Ryan wouldn't say whether
any criminal action was being sought against Mr. Spiegel, but
he said the Justice Department was involved in the
investigation that led to the administrative charges. He also
said the thrift office is investigating "at least three other
institutions" and their junk-bond dealings with Drexel.
   The administrative action comes as Columbia is being
required, under last year's savings-and-loan bailout law, to
liquidate its once hugely profitable junk-bond holdings.
Currently valued at about $2.9 billion, the portfolio has
declined in value by about $1 billion over the last six
months, leaving Columbia insolvent and on the verge of
federal takeover. Company officials have expressed confidence
that they will be able to sell the bonds, however, to help
minimize the institution's losses.
   Mr. Spiegel, whose father Abraham is Columbia's chairman,
resigned under pressure as Columbia's president and chief
executive in December and was a consultant until this past
spring.
   In addition to the costs for the airplanes, the thrift
office is seeking the following restitution:
   -- $2.9 million for a bonus paid to Mr. Spiegel last year.
Regulators objected when Columbia paid Mr. Spiegel a $3
million bonus, the thrift office said, and in response, Mr.
Spiegel returned $600,000. The office is seeking the return
of the remaining $2.4 million plus interest.
   -- $5.7 million for losses allegedly incurred by Columbia
on $28 million in loans made to Howard Schneider, a luxury
auto dealer and friend of Mr. Spiegel. The office said Mr.
Schneider lent Mr. Spiegel a Mercedes 560 SEL and a Bentley
while the loans were being negotiated. The office alleged the
loans were made at below-market interest rates and weren't
properly documented. Mr. Schneider wasn't charged with
wrongdoing.
   -- $2.4 million for allegedly unauthorized payments made
to a charitable foundation controlled by Mr. Spiegel. The
thrift office said most of the foundation assets were
invested in junk bonds and Columbia stock.
   -- $1.1 million for the alleged personal use of four
condominiums owned by Columbia, including two in Jackson
Hole, one in Indian Wells, Calif., and one in Deer Valley,
Utah.
   -- $463,000 allegedly used for personal expenses,
including four trips to Europe for Mr. Spiegel and his wife,
$55,000 in guns, the Michael Jackson tickets and also tickets
to a Steve Winwood concert, $2,000 for a French wine-tasting
course and $1,700 for silverware.
   The total restitution of $19 million would go to Columbia.
The thrift office is also seeking $5 million in civil
penalties that would go to the government.
   The action freezes Mr. Spiegel's funds and assets with any
financial institution until he establishes an escrow account
or puts up other security to guarantee the restitution. He is
also prohibited from voting his Columbia stock. Mr. Ryan of
the thrift office said the agency is convinced Mr. Spiegel
has the wealth to pay the restitution and fine. The office
also is seeking to bar Mr. Spiegel from working in any
federally insured bank or thrift in the future.
   Mr. Spiegel has 20 days to reply to the thrift office and
request a hearing.
   Mr. Spiegel's compensation at Columbia has long been an
issue for regulators. In 1985, for instance, he earned an
estimated $9 million in salary and benefits, roughly 17 times
what the chairman of the nation's largest S&amp;L was making.
Columbia was also the top-earning S&amp;L in the country at that
time, but the package drew a public rebuke from federal
thrift regulators.
   Earlier this year, regulators ordered that a $500,000
annual consulting fee that Mr. Spiegel was receiving from
Columbia be reduced to $1 a year.

   Bonds Fall on Surprisingly Strong Auto Sales,
   Creating Anxieties About Today's Jobs Data

   NEW YORK -- News that car sales surged in late June gave
big bond dealers the jitters yesterday, prompting them to
sell bonds out of fear that today's employment report may
also deliver surprising results.
   Prior to the release of the car-sales data, many bond
dealers loaded up on long-term Treasury bonds. They were
betting that the employment report would show an economy
that's growing weaker and revive speculation among investors
that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates to stave
off recession. That, in turn, would cause bond prices to
soar.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But after the car-sales data were released, "the tone
became a little more apprehensive" as players reconsidered
just how weak the jobs statistics will be, said Joseph Liro,
a vice president and money-market economist at S.G. Warburg
Securities &amp; Co. Inc.
   Domestic auto sales were estimated yesterday to have been
running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of eight million
units in the June 21-30 period, the highest rate since
February. Industry analysts had expected an annual rate of
about seven million units.
   In response to the data, bond prices slid. The benchmark
30-year Treasury bond fell more than 1/4 point, or $2.50 for
a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which
moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 8.40%.
   Bond-market analysts said the auto data, which was the
highlight of an otherwise dull session, inspired some market
participants to liquidate their holdings of longer-term
bonds. Most of the trading was executed by bond dealers,
while retail investors remained quiet on the sidelines.
   "Some dealers decided to lighten up their positions and
take profits in response to the auto-sales report, which came
in much stronger than expected. The report introduced a bit
of caution to the market," said William Sullivan, director of
money-market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "If auto
sales had come in weaker, then {dealers} may have decided to
buy the market instead of sell it."
   Mr. Sullivan said the price movements were exaggerated by
the market's thin trading condition, which was curbed by the
lingering effect of the Independence holiday on Wednesday and
caution ahead of the jobs data.
   Trading typically slows to a crawl on the day before the
release of jobs statistics, and this session was no
exception.
   The data are considered the most important of the
government's monthly economic releases because they provide
the first official reading of how the economy fared in a
given month.
   Surprises in the report often jar the bond market. The
softer-than-expected May employment report issued on June 1,
for instance, pushed bond prices up more than a full point, a
gain of about $10 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
   The employment report, however, is taking on more
significance this time because it comes on the heels of the
Federal Reserve's two-day Federal Open Market Committee
meeting that ended Tuesday.
   There is speculation that members of the FOMC may have
decided to ease monetary policy if the jobs data point up
extremely sluggish economic growth.
   "I think the Fed adopted an asymmetrical directive with a
bias toward easing," said Mr. Liro of S.G. Warburg. But "to
get an immediate ease, you're going to have to need some very
weak numbers" in the jobs report, he adds.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Yields rose on long-term and intermediate-term Treasury
securities yesterday, but short-term rates declined due
largely to reports that Bush administration officials are
considering a proposal to impose a tax on the sale of
securities as a way of reducing the budget deficit.
   The excise tax would apply to the sale of stocks, options
and debt, but not Treasury securities. Some analysts said
that money was leaving the stock market and flowing into
Treasury bills, which is where some investors park cash
temporarily.
   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of about 103
20/32 to yield 8.40% compared with a price of 103 28/32 to
yield 8.38% on Tuesday. The financial markets were closed
Wednesday in observance of Independence Day. The latest
10-year notes ended at a price of 103 1/32 to yield 8.395%,
the price was down from 103 4/32 to yield 8.38% on Tuesday.
   But short-term rates were lower. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.67% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.91%, while the rate on six-month
bills ended at 7.58% to yield 7.97%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Bonds

   The junk bonds of Southland Corp., which operates the
7-Eleven convenience-store chain, rose sharply yesterday on
news that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved its
plan to refinance $1.8 billion in debt and some cumulative
exchangeable preferred stock.
   The exchange offers would provide bondholders with debt
securities totalling about $550 million. In addition,
bondholders and preferred shareholders are being offered
approximately 18.5% of Southland's common stock in the
exchange offers. Existing shareholders -- led by the
Dallas-based Thompson family, which founded Southland --
would retain approximately 6.5% of the common stock and,
following consummation of the exchange offers, the Japanese
companies Ito-Yokado and Seven-Eleven Japan would purchase
75% of the stock.
   Southland's 16.75% subordinated debentures due in 2002
ended the day up one point at 13. The 15.75% senior
subordinated notes, due in 1997, were unchanged at 23.
   The junk bonds of Charter Medical Corp. jumped on news
that the company is considering proposals for the sale and
lease-back of several of its hospitals.
   The announcements were an attempt to assure bondholders
that the heavily financed company had the ability to make
interest payments on outstanding debt. The company also said
it was "current with all debt obligations," and added that it
had $50 million in cash and a $30 million line of bank credit
available.
   Charter Medical's 14% senior subordinated debentures,
which reached an all-time low of 38 last week, were bid at 40
1/2, up 1/2 point on the day. The company's 14.25%
subordinated debentures ended 1/2 higher at 22.
   In the broader market, most junk bonds barely budged from
Tuesday's level in activity that one trader described as "the
slowest day of the year." Prices were also little changed
among investment-grade bonds.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Most major foreign government bonds ended lower yesterday.
   British government bonds, called gilts, fell sharply
despite continued firmness in the pound. Traders said
profit-taking by overseas investors was mostly responsible
for the huge price declines.
   Selling also stemmed from concern about the government's
budget outlook. Local newspapers reported that the central
government may provide #2.5 billion ($4.44 billion) in
additional grants to municipal governments to discourage
increases in a politically unpopular new local tax charge.
   Britain's 11.75% bond due 2003/2007 fell 1 3/32 point to
100 27/32 to yield 11.62% while the 12% notes due in 1995
fell 3/4 point to 99 1/8 to yield 12.26%.
   In Japan, prices of government bonds followed the movement
of the yen to lower levels.
   At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
price of the benchmark 10-year yen bond was 86.85, down 0.10
point to yield 7.22%.
   In West Germany, government bonds ended about 0.35 point
weaker in what traders term a technical correction, unrelated
to economic events.
   Even the new German Unity Bonds, which were launched on
Wednesday, slipped yesterday. The 10-year 8.75% German Unity
Bond fell 0.40 point to 100.60 to yield 8.66%.
   (Foreign bond yields are quoted here in local terms and
therefore differ somewhat from yields calculated for these
markets by U.S. investment firms, which tend to use the
semiannual compound measure to compare yields across
markets.)
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Actively traded municipal bonds finished unchanged to 1/4
point higher in snail-paced dealings.
   With market participants sluggish after Independence Day
and cautious before Friday's release of the U.S. employment
data for June, there was little action.
   But traders say the market is still in good shape because
of talk about tax increases and speculation that Federal
Reserve easing of interest rates is around the bend.
   The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% securities of
2018 ended 1/8 higher at 98 7/8, pushing the yield down to
7.27% from 7.28% late Tuesday.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   In what turned out to be the expected limp trading day,
mortgage securities prices ended unchanged to slightly
firmer.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, Federal Home Loan
Mortgage 9.5% securities for July delivery were unchanged at
98 30/32 and Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5%
securities for July were flat at 99 14/32.

   Houston Gets Ready
   To Show Itself Off

   Host to Economic Summit,
   City Wants World to See

   HOUSTON -- For three days next week the eyes of the world
will be upon Texas. And Houston wants to take advantage of
the situation.
   The thousands of red begonias and the 126 spanking new
police cars that will be much in evidence are but small parts
of a big scheme to put the best face on the city for the
annual economic summit of industrialized nations that begins
Monday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some 4,000 journalists will be here doing stories, and
Houston wants at least some of that to result in business for
Houston -- global financing for new development, for
instance, in a city that has been depressed since the bottom
dropped out of oil and that is just now coming back.
   Houston could use a little respect; it feels the need to
be noticed.
   "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for this city,"
exclaims advertising executive Larry Taylor, who, along with
many Houstonians, is hyperbolic about what next week's summit
means for his town.
   Never mind that reporters keep telling the city's phalanx
of PR people that they are coming to write about the summit
itself. "Reporters are less interested in Houston than in the
seven leaders" who are holding talks here, says Peter
Riddell, Washington bureau chief for the Financial Times of
London.
   Never mind that the ranks of summit journalists have been
thinned by a London meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and by the Soviet Party Congress in Moscow,
competing news events of recent days. Many press people will
be too pooped from those trips to pursue what they see as
civic-boosterism fluff in the Houston metro area. "We don't
have much time to go around," says Pascal Taillandier of
Agence France Presse.
   The city was taken aback to learn a few weeks ago that
although Thatcher, Kohl and Mitterrand will be here,
Jennings, Brokaw and Rather sent regrets.
   "It was a real blow," says Alex Kopatic, another of those
hyping Houston to reporters. "Disappointment was severe."
That the networks weren't dropping anchor in Houston was
front-page news in the Houston Post and a major preoccupation
of the nation's fourth-largest city for several days.
   The networks will, of course, have people here next week,
but not their biggest people. And that grates. Dan Rather of
CBS, is after all, a native son. George Bush calls Houston
home, too. Which is why the summit is to be here in the first
place. (Local television reporters noted this week that a
newspaper in Japan did write about Houston and used a
photograph of Mayor Kathy Whitmire.)
   Heads of state are important people, but so far as Houston
is concerned, the summit's most important people are the
journalists. "The international press was the major benefit
we saw" in playing host to the summit, says Mayor Whitmire.
   Houston's breathlessness about media coverage is, to a
great extent, a byproduct of its recent wrenching financial
hard times. The thin-skinned energy capital got bruised
considerably as reporters wrote graphic stories in the
mid-1980s detailing what the crash in oil prices did to this
once high-flying region, says Lyn Johnson, the summit's
deputy communications director. Now that it has them here for
the summit, Houston wants to convince reporters that it is no
longer on the mat.
   About 50 summit workers have been cranking out press
releases at the rate of two a week since April. They have
delivered more than 5,000, 200-page Houston reference guides
and set up plans to serve food to the press round the clock
during the three-day summit. (Japanese reporters, writing for
Tokyo deadlines, will be able to take their dinners at 3 a.m.
if they wish to.) Reporters too busy to go out on the town in
search of stories about Houston can visit booths and speakers
at press headquarters more than glad to provide information
about the city's huge medical center, its space and oil
industries and whatnot.
   Summit handlers have even figured out how to finesse
Houston's miserable summer weather. "Houston's Hot," is the
city's upbeat summit slogan. Mr. Taylor, the adman, says he
came up with the very apt line during the first 10 minutes of
a brainstorming session. Still, he says, it took a committee
three weeks of wrangling to approve it. People were worried
that it would just encourage unwanted stories about the local
climate. Otherwise, who would notice the 95-degree days and
the 90% humidity?
   Reporters who do venture out into the blistering heat of
this sprawling town will see how Houston has gussied itself
up. City horticulturist Dee Howell, for instance, exhorted
Houstonians to plant red and white flowers around their
houses. "They have a lot of image impact," she says,
"especially a lot of television impact."
   Texas Commerce Bank employees volunteered to spend a
weekend planting 8,500 red begonias around Rice University
where the summitteers will hold their meetings.
Unfortunately, says Brandy Wolf, who organized the planting,
"there's no sprinkler system." Fortunately, a landscaping
concern donated its services in trucking in water to keep the
blossoms on the begonias until Chancellor Kohl and network
television have left town.
   That's typical. A lot of Houston's image burnishing for
the summit is cosmetic and temporary. The city's skyscrapers,
for instance, are going to leave lights on at night to look
good for the cameras. Also, Houston isn't fining sidewalk
vendors for the time being. "We're trying to foster a street
life," says Ross Allyn, a city-council aide. "This is
directed at the 4,000 reporters coming to town," he adds.
   The police were equally matter-of-fact about holding back
126 new squad cars for more than two months so as to keep
them in factory-fresh condition for summit motorcades.
   Having the cars but not being able to use them has caused
some annoyance on the force in recent weeks. Mark Clark, a
Houston policeman and head of an officers' association, says,
"We're just barely getting by" with the vehicles in the
department's aging 1,000-car fleet. "The cars break down."
Veteran Houston radio journalist Garvin Berry chimed in: The
summit has "warped {the} judgment" of civic leaders.
   James Harrington, legal director for the Texas Civil
Liberties Union in Austin, attacked another decision. The 14
judges who hear criminal misdemeanor cases here met last
month and decided to double the bail bonds, to $1,000, for
out-of-state protesters who get arrested during the summit.
The step is necessary, they said, to ensure that itinerant
wrongdoers return to Houston for trial later on.
   "That's just a pretext for punishing speech," says Mr.
Harrington. "They just want to have a nice, clean, antiseptic
summit."
   A number of demonstrators, ranging from the Ku Klux Klan
to anti-abortion activists, nevertheless are expected in
Houston next week. The higher bonds will hardly affect
protester turnout, says Jimi Clark, march organizer for the
Poor People's Campaign for Economic Justice.
   Summit planners considered asking judges to keep
sensational cases off their dockets during summit week, but,
under fire, abandoned the idea. Mr. Harrington says, "These
people need a lesson in democracy."
   So the city is uptight, as perhaps any city might be. And
it wants to take advantage of the photo opportunity, as any
city would. Indeed, organizers of the 1988 summit in Toronto
told Houston planners that they wish they had done more to
capitalize on the affair when they had the chance. "It's an
opportunity wherever the summit is held," says Albert Louer,
who helped set up the 1983 summit in Williamsburg, Va. "It
would be somewhat ridiculous not to" take advantage of it.
   Still, Bill Simon, a University of Houston sociology
professor, maintains that "Houston has always been
self-conscious" because it grew so big so fast. As cities go,
it is an adolescent. Its population has grown rapidly in
recent years, and most of the skyscrapers that give the city
its impressive modernistic skyline (especially when they are
lit up at night) are new in the past decade.
   A classic, adolescent identity crisis manifested itself
when the Special Events Committee for the summit was trying
to decide between rodeo and ballet as entertainment for the
visiting dignitaries and media people. City planners asked
the city's opera, symphony and ballet to work on a program.
"We want to do away with the redneck image," says Tony
Lentini, a public-relations volunteer. But the decision was
countermanded by President Bush, wearing his Texas hat not
his Connecticut hat. Wanting a down-home event, he insisted
on an evening of barbecue, rodeo and country music. en

   Quarterly Review of Mutual Funds:
   Decade's Star Magellan Likes Financial Stocks

   The man at the helm of the $14 billion Fidelity Magellan
Fund now may be Morris Smith instead of the celebrated Peter
Lynch, but otherwise it's business as usual.
   Like Mr. Lynch before him, Mr. Smith is in almost
perpetual motion, visiting companies, grilling analysts and
buying stocks by the fistful. His biggest bet now: nonbank
financial stocks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Smith took over as manager of the country's largest
mutual fund on June 1. That was also the day his wife went
into labor. But Mr. Smith stuck it out at the office, working
a full day. "It was the fourth time around, so you get used
to it," said Mr. Smith, a 32-year-old graduate of the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "If I'd had to
come home, she would have called me."
   On that occasion, Mr. Smith bet right. His wife didn't
give birth until the following day. But the real question for
Magellan's one million shareholders is, can Mr. Smith deliver
in the stock market?
   Fidelity Magellan is the country's largest fund, with the
best 10-year record. Mr. Smith, who until recently managed
the Fidelity OTC fund, has been at the Magellan helm for only
a month. Early returns show Magellan up 0.44% for June, vs.
0.16% for the average stock fund.
   "The most obvious change is that there are a lot fewer
names in the fund," said Mr. Smith. He has trimmed back
Magellan's holdings from 1,300 stocks when Mr. Lynch
announced his resignation at the end of March to 775 today.
"That appears to be a lot more significant than it is.
Peter's secret was not owning a lot of names. It was making
big bets on a few stocks."
   Mr. Smith is continuing this tradition. The fund's 50
largest holdings account for 38% of the fund's assets, and
the top 100 holdings amount to 52%.
   Mr. Smith's biggest current position is in nonbank
financial stocks, an area Mr. Lynch also was fond of. Mr.
Smith has retained, and in some cases added to, Magellan's
large positions in the Federal National Mortgage Association,
Student Loan Marketing Association, Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. and financial services companies such as
Kemper Corp. and Primerica Corp.
   "Most of these stocks have very attractive fundamentals.
They have visible earnings, and they are at attractive
price/earnings ratios," said Mr. Smith. "They're being
tainted with the same brush as the bank stocks."
   Mr. Smith, for instance, thinks the earnings at Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, two entities that buy home loans and
repackage them as securities, will grow 12% to 15% annually
over the next few years. "I don't see many stocks with that
outlook which are trading at roughly eight times next year's
earnings," he said.
   Mr. Smith is also enamored of Kemper, the insurance and
money management firm. He reckons Kemper, which closed
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at
$41.25, up 25 cents, will earn between $5.50 and $6 a share
next year.
   When Mr. Lynch announced his resignation, Magellan had
hefty positions in Nestle S.A., Philip Morris Cos. and
Unilever PLC. Mr. Smith said he still owns the stocks, but he
has also built up big positions in his favorites such as
PepsiCo Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., both of which rank
among the fund's 10 largest holdings.
   "There's probably more of a weighting in technology than
there was before," said Mr. Smith, who has bought large
positions in companies including Compaq Computer Corp. and
Conner Peripherals Inc. "That's probably something I brought
with me from the OTC fund." Mr. Smith has also added to
stakes in some of his favorite over-the-counter companies,
such as the athletic-shoe maker Nike Inc. and the
long-distance telephone carrier MCI Communications Corp.
   With Mr. Lynch gone, the mutual fund manager with the best
10-year record is G. Kenneth Heebner, who has managed CGM
Capital Development and New England Growth since 1977. For
the past decade, the two funds rank as the third and fifth
best performers, respectively.
                                                                                                       

   Five-Year Leader
                                                                                                       

   Japan Fund                                   +288.67%
                                                                                                       

   Life has been a roller coaster lately for the Japan Fund,
a no-load mutual fund managed by New York's Scudder, Stevens
&amp; Clark.
   In this year's first quarter the $365 million fund was
pummeled for a 16.1% loss, as the Tokyo stock market tanked.
But in the most recent three months, the fund bounced back
16.27%, making it one of the second quarter's top performing
funds.
   "The {Japanese} market for small companies went up in the
first quarter, while the rest of the market was down," noted
the fund's 62-year-old manager, O. Robert Theurkauf. He said
the Japan Fund's performance was helped because small and
medium-sized companies account for more than 30% of its stock
portfolio: "That's the single most important factor that
explains this year's good performance."
   Rough times are nothing new to the Japan Fund. It used to
be a closed-end, or publicly traded, fund. But it came under
attack by corporate raiders and in 1987 converted to a
regular open-end mutual fund, issuing and redeeming shares to
meet investor demand. The fund also had a recent manager
change in February, when Mr. Theurkauf, who has worked at
Scudder for 40 years, took over leadership of the fund.
   But through it all, the fund has produced stellar results.
It ranks as the top fund over five years and the fourth best
for the past decade.
   Mr. Theurkauf isn't ready to make startling predictions
about the Tokyo stock market, but he does sound a note of
caution about the Japanese economy. "We think the underlying
inflation is very real, and this is manifesting itself in
higher interest rates," he said. "If you talk to brokers,
they'll say the market is going back to 40000. We doubt it."
Japan's Nikkei index of 225 stocks closed Thursday at
32351.67 points.
   For now, Mr. Theurkauf is placing his bets on large
noncyclical companies including such retailers as Autobacs
Seven Co., Aoyama Trading Co. and Ito-Yokado Co. He is also
hanging on to seemingly undervalued smaller companies such as
Asatsu Inc., an advertising agency, and Ines Corp., MKC Ltd.
and Nippon System Development Co., all of which produce
computer software.
                                                                                                       

   12-Month Leader
                                                                                                       

   Fidelity Select Biotechnology                + 56.36%
                                                                                                       

   For managers of Fidelity's 38 Select portfolios, which
each invest in a single industry, it sure helps to be in the
right place at the right time.
   Nobody knows that better than Michael Gordon, the
25-year-old manager of the $160 million Fidelity Select
Biotechnology. Propelled by a run-up in biotechnology stocks
that started in early 1989, the fund has the best 12-month
record of all mutual funds, with a total return of 56.36%.
   Mr. Gordon, who graduated three years ago from Tufts
University with a double major in classics and quantitative
economics, said biotech stocks have been boosted by a series
of successful product launches and by the proposed merger of
Genentech Inc. with Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding
Ltd. Genentech, which closed on the Big Board at $29, up 50
cents, is Mr. Gordon's largest position.
   Under the $2.1 billion merger pact, which got the nod from
Genentech's shareholders in June but still needs approval
from the Federal Trade Commission, Roche Holding will buy 60%
of Genentech's stock. For every two Genentech shares, holders
will get $36 in cash plus one share of redeemable Genentech
common stock. Roche has the right to buy all of the
redeemable stock at various dates between December 1990 and
June 1995. The redemption price ranges from $38 a share for
the earliest redemption date to $60 if Roche waits until June
1995. "It's most attractive {for shareholders} if the
redeemable stock is redeemed this December," said Mr. Gordon,
based on the imputed rate of return of the various redemption
prices.
   The fund's second largest position is Amgen Inc., which
last year successfully introduced Epogen, a drug that
stimulates red blood cell production and can be used to treat
dialysis patients suffering from anemia. Mr. Gordon has his
eye on the company's next big product launch.
   "The company has a second product, called G-CSF, which
boosts bone marrow and thereby fights infections," said Mr.
Gordon, who expects the drug to be able to help cancer
patients undergoing chemotherapy. He expects the product's
introduction to be approved in Europe and the U.S. within a
year. "Earnings should continue to grow at 35% to 50%
{annually} for a few years once this thing is launched."
   The fund has 70% of its assets in biotechnology research
companies such as Amgen and Genentech. But Mr. Gordon also
invests in some companies that supply the big research
outfits. The fund owns such stocks as Applied Biosystems
Inc., which makes machines for analyzing DNA, and Life
Technologies Inc., which supplies reagents to biotech
companies.
                                                                                                       

   Second-Quarter Leader

   "Ours is a fund you will truly feel good about," proclaims
the 100% recycled paper marketing brochure for the Schield
Progressive Environmental Fund.
   Schield's shareholders would no doubt agree. For the most
recent quarter, the fund ranks as the top performing mutual
fund, with a total return of 29.54%.
   "Twenty-five years ago, the environmental business was
garbage collection," said Glenn Cutler, the fund's
36-year-old manager. "Today, the environmental business as we
know it is in its infancy. We've littered the earth with the
residue of progress."
   The Schield fund, which was launched in February and has
assets of just $1.6 million, is hardly your typical mutual
fund. According to its prospectus, the fund invests in
"companies engaged in contributing to a cleaner and healthier
environment." But the fund's stock picks are also vetted to
make sure the companies are "socially responsible." And lest
investors have any further doubts about the fund's good
intentions, the fund's distributor also donates part of its
annual fee to charity.
   This fund isn't for the faint of heart. Schield
Progressive Environmental is a so-called nondiversified fund,
which means it can invest its assets in a relatively small
number of stocks. The fund currently owns just 14 stocks,
mostly smaller companies traded over-the-counter or on the
American Stock Exchange. Three stocks account for almost 34%
of the fund's assets, and some of the fund's holdings trade
at well over 20 times earnings.
   "You can't buy environmental stocks based on
{price/earnings} multiples," said Mr. Cutler. "You've got to
pick them up based on the niche they're in, the quality of
the management and their growth rate."
   The fund's largest position, at 16% of assets, is Sanifill
Inc., an operator of landfills in Georgia and Texas. "It's a
great cash generating business with prices moving in the
right direction," said Mr. Cutler, who reckons the company
will earn 50 cents to 60 cents a share this year. Sanifill
closed in American Stock Exchange composite trading at
$21.25, up 50 cents.
   Mr. Cutler also has a big stake in Martech USA Inc., which
is in the marine pollution control business. Martech played a
role in the Exxon Valdez oil cleanup. "Nobody wants to see
large oil spills, but there are spills every day," said Mr.
Cutler. "Most of them don't get reported in the news." He
expects Martech, which fell 25 cents in national
over-the-counter trading to $13.25, will earn 95 cents a
share for the year ending in August.
   Schield Progressive Environmental charges a 4.5% sales
commission on investments. The fund also has projected annual
expenses of 2.5%, well above the 1.5% average for stock
mutual funds.

   Monsanto's Blood Pressure Drug Found
   More Effective for Blacks Than 2 Others

   A Monsanto Co. blood pressure drug is more effective among
black patients than two competing drugs, University of
Maryland researchers said.
   In a study of 394 patients, Verapamil SR, a calcium
channel blocker, reduced hypertension in as many as 73% of
cases, while captopril, an ACE inhibitor marketed by
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. was effective in 57.1% of patients
and ICI Pharma's atenolol, a beta blocker, had a 59.6%
effective rate, the researchers said. ICI Pharma is the U.S.
arm of Britain's Imperial Chemical Industries PLC.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Verapamil SR is marketed under the trade name Calan SR by
Monsanto's G.D. Searle unit, which funded the study,
published in the current issue of Archives of Internal
Medicine.
   Previous research has shown that diuretics and the class
of drugs known as calcium channel blockers appear to be more
effective among blacks than the other types of blood pressure
medicines. This study was the first to compare the three
classes of medicines among black patients.
   Drug companies often support clinical trials that compare
the effectiveness of competing drugs to use in marketing
their products. This study demonstrates that all three
medicines worked well among blacks, says Matthew R. Weir,
medical director of clinical research at the University of
Maryland Hospital, Baltimore. Patients responded best to the
calcium channel blocker, but the effectiveness of the other
two drugs was higher than previous studies have shown, the
study says.
   Hypertension is more prevalent among blacks than
non-blacks and such illness as coronary artery disease,
stroke and kidney disease develop earlier among blacks.
Researchers think differences in blood chemistry and other
factors partially explain blacks' susceptibility to
hypertension, as well as their varied responses to different
classes of medicines.
   Calcium channel blockers help lower blood pressure by
reducing the heart's workload. Beta blockers block certain
nerve impulses and slow down the heart's activity, reducing
its need for oxygen. ACE (for angiotensin converting enzyme)
blocks the action of a kidney enzyme that causes blood
vessels to tighten. One reason researchers think blacks are
less responsive to ACE inhibitors, for instance, is that
blacks typically already have low levels of renin, the enzyme
the drug blocks.
   Doctors commonly prescribe diuretics to black patients,
but researchers are increasingly concerned that these
medicines increase the risk among both black and non-black
patients for heart disease, high cholesterol and abnormal
blood chemistry, Dr. Weir says. The study shows that "there
are drugs that work well in blacks besides diuretics."
   Diuretics, at a cost of about $5 a month, are much cheaper
than the other drugs, which range from $20 to $30 a month per
equivalent dose, he adds.

   Groupe Bruxelles Lambert Displays
   Renewed Vigor After Collapse of Drexel

   BRUSSELS -- Groupe Bruxelles Lambert S.A. is showing
renewed vigor four months after the collapse of New York
securities firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., once one
of its biggest money makers.
   GBL, which controls a small empire of oil, banking,
insurance and broadcasting interests, has begun selling
peripheral assets, building up its cash reserves and
concentrating its firepower where it will have the most
effect.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To write off its indirect stake of about 20% in Drexel,
GBL was forced to take a charge of 3.2 billion Belgian francs
($93.7 million) against its 1989 earnings.
   Though the financial damage was relatively small, GBL was
stung by criticism over its handling of the affair. Analysts
reproached the company for not having sold its stake in the
mid-1980s, when the junk-bond house was still flying high.
They also criticized GBL for having let itself become so
dependent on an investment over which it had no control.
Drexel, which in its glory days accounted for as much as 40%
of GBL's profit, never deigned to give its big Belgian
shareholder a board seat.
   GBL's lack of control made it look like a passive
investor, and analysts made unflattering comparisons with
Belgium's largest big holding company, Societe Generale de
Belgique S.A., which has reinvigorated large parts of its
empire in the two years since it came under the control of
France's Cie. de Suez.
   Now the normally secretive GBL is depicting itself as a
decidedly active investor, willing to buy and sell. At a
shareholders meeting in May, GBL's chairman, Albert Frere,
said GBL would concentrate on a limited number of
high-quality companies, primarily ones based in Europe and in
which GBL can have a significant influence.
   In the past, concedes Emile Quevrin, a GBL director, the
company was spread too thinly. But he says that problem was
partly a legacy from investments made long before Mr. Frere
took command as part of a 1981 rescue of GBL. One of those
legacies was Drexel; another was Cie. Internationale des
Wagons-Lits &amp; du Tourisme S.A., a Franco-Belgian travel
company best known for operating sleeping compartments on
trains.
   GBL and related companies owned about 26% of Wagons-Lits
but had to contend with two other big shareholders, with
which the Belgians didn't always agree on strategy. Thus,
last week, GBL announced an agreement to sell most of the
Wagons-Lits stake to Generale de Belgique for more than BF10
billion.
   That was the latest in a series of sales announced by GBL
and Pargesa Holding S.A., a Geneva-based company, which is
headed by Mr. Frere and Paul Desmarais Sr., chairman of Power
Corp. of Canada, and which owns about 38% of GBL.
   In June, GBL and Pargesa put up for sale their controlling
stake in Henry Ansbacher Holdings PLC, which owns a small
London merchant bank. Pargesa's Parfinance S.A. affiliate,
meanwhile, has recently agreed to sell minority stakes in
Societe Parisienne d'Entreprises &amp; de Participations, a
holding company for the engineering concern Groupe Schneider;
and in Cie. Francaise de l'Afrique Occidentale, a trading
company. In April, Pargesa sold its minority stake in Banque
Paribas (Suisse) S.A. to Cie. Financiere de Paribas of
France.
   GBL retains large minority stakes in Petrofina S.A., a
Brussels-based oil and petrochemical company; Royale Belge
S.A., an insurer; Banque Bruxelles Lambert S.A., and Banque
Internationale a Luxembourg S.A., as well as a dominant stake
in the Luxembourg-based broadcaster RTL and interests in
Belgian electric utilities.
   In addition, through various companies, Messrs. Frere and
Desmarais control nearly 10% of Paribas, giving them a
serious voice at the prestigious French merchant bank.
   GBL hasn't disclosed how much it will raise with all of
its asset sales, but analysts figure that the company will
have considerable cash on its hands. Mr. Quevrin, the GBL
director, said part of the proceeds will be used to help GBL
achieve its long-stated aim of raising its stake in Petrofina
to 25% from about 20%, but he said GBL will wait for
favorable market conditions.
   The rest, he said, is likely to be used for new investment
opportunities. Mr. Quevrin declined to say what sort of
opportunities GBL is studying but said the company would
favor industries with which it has some experience. Even so,
the executive made it clear that GBL doesn't want to be
tightly bound by a strategy. "We are very opportunistic," he
said.
   One reason GBL is moving faster, Mr. Quevrin suggested, is
that its ownership structure has become a bit less complex.
Last February, Messrs. Frere and Desmarais strengthened their
grip on Pargesa, announcing that they jointly controlled just
over 50%, which in turn gave them a better hold on GBL.
   Analysts welcome GBL's livelier approach. "It's the good
old GBL," says Patrick de Bellefroid, chief analyst at the
Brussels brokerage firm of Puissant Baeyens Poswick &amp; Cie.
"Albert Frere remains a king-size deal maker."

   A NEW ENERGY TAX is being pushed by the Bush
administration as a way to help cut the budget deficit. The
levy would bring in an estimated $20 billion a year, more
than any other part of the revenue-raising package being
considered. The tax would apply to various sources of energy,
including coal and petroleum, and would add five or six cents
a gallon to the price of gasoline.

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices fell sharply in very thin
trading, triggered by news that the Bush administration might
back a 0.5% tax on securities sales as part of a budget
deficit-reduction package.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 32.42 points to
2879.21. Bond prices also sank, but the dollar was mixed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Much of the activity in stocks was generated by program
traders intent on capturing profits from fleeting price
discrepancies between stock-index futures contracts and the
underlying stocks. Stock futures prices fell faster than
stock prices, so program traders bought the cheaper futures
and sold stocks. Their tactics caused the Dow Jones
industrials to fall in spasmodic fashion during the morning.
   Moreover, "Talk about a stock transfer tax provided some
excuse to sell" following five sessions of rising stock
prices, said James Solloway, chief economist at Argus
Research. He added that "it's way too early to tell whether
that tax will ever become a reality." In fact, the report may
turn out to be a trial balloon that quickly gets shot down,
he said.
   Another reason program trading had so much influence is
that many investors are either on vacation or sitting on the
sidelines awaiting this morning's disclosure of June jobs
data. Many investors are hoping that payroll employment
growth will be weak enough to coax the Federal Reserve into
lowering interest rates soon.
   "I'm not buying that," said Mr. Solloway. "I think there
may be the chance to see a surprising gain in payroll
employment." If he is right, and if many investors already
have bet on a near-term Fed ease, both stocks and bonds could
be in for rough sledding.
   Bond prices didn't react to the tax talk and were
unchanged most of the day. Then, June car sales came in
stronger than expected, leading some investors to wonder if
today's employment report might follow suit.
   Uncertainty about interest rates continues to affect the
dollar. It closed only slightly higher against the mark,
which is holding steady in the aftermath of monetary union
between East and West Germany. The yen strengthened on the
expectation of lower U.S. interest rates, which would make
Japanese rates relatively more appealing.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell on volume of 128.3 million shares in New
York Stock Exchange trading. Declining issues swamped
advancers, 1,058 to 397.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell more than a quarter of a point, or more
than $2.50 for each $1,000 of face amount, in light trading.
The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose to
8.40%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6517 marks and 150.60 yen, compared
with 1.6505 marks and 150.90 yen Tuesday.

   NATO AGREED to revise its defense policy in view of
changes in the East bloc.
   On the first day of a two-day London summit, the Western
allies generally accepted a proposal by Bush to declare that
NATO will use nuclear weapons only as a "last resort," U.S.
officials said. The allies also agreed to an American
proposal for inviting Soviet leader Gorbachev to address an
alliance meeting. The invitation would be a way of showing
that the group wants to enter an era of cooperation with its
adversaries in Eastern Europe. The U.S. and Bonn apparently
reached a compromise on a pledge for cutting back the army of
a newly united Germany.

<LP>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, in an unusual move
against a major accounting firm, is seeking a permanent
injunction barring Price Waterhouse from violating securities
law.
   In a trial that began yesterday in federal court in New
York, the SEC said the injunction is necessary to ensure that
the accounting firm doesn't commit securities fraud in
connection with audits it does for clients. SEC attorneys
said the case is one of the first in which the agency has
sought such a court order against a major accounting firm.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If an injunction is issued, the firm could be held in
contempt of court and would face additional penalties if it
were ever found guilty of violating the securities law. The
injunction would also be a black eye for the firm, because
the SEC claims that Price Waterhouse is likely to break the
law unless the injunction is ordered.
   The charges stem from work that Price Waterhouse did in
1980 for AM International Inc., a Chicago-based maker of
business graphics equipment. In 1985, the SEC filed a civil
suit accusing Price Waterhouse and three of its partners of
violating securities laws by approving AM's fiscal 1980
financial statements. The SEC claims that the firm and its
partners should have disclosed in their auditing report that
AM was using improper and possibly inaccurate accounting
methods.
   "Where an entry says `black,' they'll have you believe it
means `white,'" said Kevin O'Rourke, an SEC attorney, in his
opening arguments. The non-jury trial is being heard by U.S.
District Judge John E. Sprizzo.
   Mr. O'Rourke said Price Waterhouse had altered documents
to cover up the alleged misconduct.
   David R. Jewell, an attorney for Price Waterhouse and the
three partners also named in the suit, said the firm had
taken proper accounting steps in dealing with AM
International.
   "As to the individual defendants and as to the firm, the
evidence will simply not support the SEC's allegations," Mr.
Jewell said in his opening statements to the judge. He said
that any alterations that were made in the firm's reports
were done following standard review procedures.
   The three individual defendants in the case are Daniel
Jerbasi, a partner who currently does auditing work; Benjamin
Perks, a partner in the firm's Chicago office who now works
with the firm's litigation support group; and Michael LeRoy,
a former partner who has since left the firm and no longer
works as an accountant. The SEC is also seeking an injunction
against the three individuals.
   The SEC could face a tough task in convincing Judge
Sprizzo that a general injunction against the firm is
required. He said he will issue the injunction only if it is
proved that the firm itself was derelict in training or
controlling its partners.
   "You have to persuade me that just because they were bad
boys in the past, they will be bad boys in the future," the
judge said.

   LAWYERS CAN INFORMALLY interview employees of firms they
sue, court rules.
   New York's highest court ruled that lawyers litigating
against a corporation can informally interview certain
employees without the consent of the corporation's lawyers.
   Reversing most of a lower court ruling, the New York Court
of Appeals said it isn't necessary "to shield all employees
from informal interviews in order to safeguard the
corporation's interest." Instead, the court said, an opposing
lawyer can talk informally with employees who aren't
responsible for making decisions that may affect the case.
   The case involves a construction worker, Thomas Niesig,
who alleges he was injured when he fell from a scaffolding at
a building construction site. He filed a complaint against
J.M. Frederick Construction of New York Inc., Plainview,
N.Y., the project's general contractor, which brought in Mr.
Niesig's employer, DeTrae Enterprises Inc., as a defendant.
Mr. Niesig's lawyer then requested informal interviews with
DeTrae employees who were on the site when the accident
allegedly occurred.
   "What the court below had in effect done is turn our
adversary system of justice into a one-sided system of
justice, saying that corporate counsel could have access to
facts and witnesses but that outside attorneys and anyone
suing a corporation could not have access," said Emily Bass,
Mr. Niesig's lawyer.
   But Frederick Simpson, who represented J.M. Frederick in
the appeal, warned that the court's decision will pose an
ethical dilemma for a lawyer because "he's not going to know
until he's into this informal discussion whether these people
are within the class of corporate employees that can be
spoken to." Lawyers for DeTrae couldn't be reached for
comment.
   The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Legal Aid
Society, the National Organization for Women and the New York
Attorney General's Office are among the groups that filed
friend-of-the-court briefs on behalf of Mr. Niesig.

   STRANGE BEDFELLOWS unite in an appeal to the high court.
   The consumer-oriented Public Citizen Litigation Group
filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to hear an appeal by
Colorado Interstate Gas Co., a Coastal Corp. unit. Included
among Colorado Interstate's high-powered battery of lawyers
is former judge Robert Bork, whose nomination to the Supreme
Court was opposed by Public Citizen in 1987.
   The consumer group is an unlikely ally for Colorado
Interstate's other lawyers as well. Lead counsel in the case
is Rex Lee, the former solicitor general who frequently
represents business interests in top court appeals, and
William Baxter, the Stanford Law School professor and former
Justice Department antitrust chief.
   The appeal challenges the ruling last September of a
federal appeals court in Denver. The appeals court threw out
most of a $412.3 million damages award that Colorado
Interstate won in a lawsuit against Natural Gas Pipeline
Company of America, a MidCon Corp. unit. A federal district
court found that Natural Gas Pipeline breached a contract
with Colorado Interstate and attempted to monopolize gas
sales in violation of U.S. antitrust law.
   Among other points, the appeals court decided that a
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order implicitly
pre-empted the breach of contract claim by Colorado
Interstate. Public Citizen's brief argues that if federal
agency orders are going to pre-empt state laws, it ought to
be done expressly -- not implicitly -- in a federal law or in
an agency ruling.
   The top court is expected to decide in October whether to
hear the case.

   MINPECO S.A., the Peruvian minerals company that won a
$134 million judgment in the silver conspiracy trial of 1988,
filed a suit yesterday against Brazilian investor Naji Robert
Nahas, one of the defendants, to enforce the judgment. The
suit, filed in the Supreme Court of Brazil, in Brasilia,
seeks the total amount of the jury award plus $105 million in
attorneys fees and interest. Two years ago, a jury in New
York federal court decided that Mr. Nahas, a resident of Sao
Paulo, and the Hunt brothers of Dallas, among others, had
conspired to manipulate world silver prices in 1979 and 1980.
So far, Minpeco has collected $92 million on the judgment.

   LOS ANGELES -- Visa International Inc. and MasterCard
International Inc. said they filed a lawsuit charging 10
individuals and 11 companies with carrying out a
telemarketing scheme designed to saddle consumers with
millions of dollars in fraudulent charges.
   The parties lured credit-card holders to call
telemarketers by promising free cars and cash prizes,
sometimes passing themselves as sanctioned by MasterCard and
Visa, the companies charged. Telemarketers in "boiler-rooms"
then used high pressure tactics to sell water purifiers,
security systems, travel packages and vitamins to card
holders, they said. Visa and MasterCard said customers didn't
receive merchandise and were billed as many as three times.

   Visa and MasterCard said losses from the alleged scheme
total $4 million, and they expect that total to grow. The
companies are seeking damages and $10 million in punitive
damages.

   Economy:
   Productivity Indicates Sluggish Economy

   Many Economists See Slow
   Gains, at Best, Ahead

   Reports on productivity are sending a worrisome message
about the U.S. economy.
   Productivity, widely regarded as the truest reflection of
underlying economic vigor, has risen only slightly over the
past year and actually fell in the early months of 1990. And
many economists foresee very slow gains, at best, in coming
months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The lackluster performance, many analysts say, reflects in
part the steadily growing role of services. Service
businesses now account for about 77% of all U.S. private
nonfarm jobs, which include jobs in manufacturing, mining and
construction. This figure is up from 70% in the mid-1970s and
60% in the early 1960s.
   But the service sector accounts for only some 47% of the
economy's total output. Service-sector jobs generally don't
lend themselves as readily to productivity gains as jobs in
manufacturing, whose share of total employment has fallen to
about 17% from more than 30% in the early 1960s.
   In the first quarter, overall productivity in nonfarm
businesses fell at an annual rate of 2.7%, according to U.S.
data. This decline was the steepest drop since early in the
1981-82 recession, and it occurred even though productivity
in manufacturing rose at an annual rate of 4.9% in the
quarter; sharply falling productivity in service businesses
wiped out the gain.
   Some economists, it should be noted, maintain that the
productivity picture is less bleak than it seems, because
productivity is difficult to measure in service businesses
and may be understated in the official Labor Department
figures.
   Gerald Faulhaber, a professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, thinks the
"government may be missing gains in service productivity." As
an example, he cites the work of secretaries, who "with the
spread of word processors are doing a higher level of work,"
which isn't given enough weight.
   Maury Harris, a PaineWebber Inc. economist in New York,
believes the Labor Department may not be taking into
full-enough consideration improved quality in the service
sector. He notes that capital spending has risen fastest in
service businesses recently and wonders how such spending can
continue "at a swift pace" without corresponding productivity
gains.
   Edwin R. Dean, associate commissioner of labor statistics
concedes that "there's some reason to think that we may be
understating service productivity." He adds that "we don't
necessarily take account of all quality changes. No one
really knows."
   In any event, there's little question that productivity
gains generally are more difficult to achieve in service
businesses. "Part of the problem in services is that new
people entering the labor force -- often those with the least
skill -- tend to go into service jobs," says Uday S.
Karmarkar, a professor at the University of Rochester's Simon
Business School.
   Another large factor in the productivity slowdown, many
analysts say, is the length of the current business
expansion.
   "Productivity typically shows the sharpest gains in the
early stages of an economic expansion and the narrowest gains
in the late stages," says Geoffrey H. Moore, director of
Columbia University's Center for International Business Cycle
Research. The current expansion, he notes, is 7 1/2 years
old, which is more than twice the average for earlier
expansions.
   "Given this expansion's very old age, it's hardly
surprising that productivity has slowed," Mr. Moore says.
   The pattern of slowing productivity reflects in part a
diminished supply of untapped labor after many recession-free
years. The labor pool -- in terms of the percentage of the
working-age population not at work -- has declined
persistently since the most recent recession, hitting record
lows in recent months. May's figures were 36.7%, within a
whisker of March's record of 36.6%. A further drag on
productivity has been earlier retirement among a relatively
productive group: males who are 45 to 54 years old.
   A slowdown in productivity, and then an actual decline,
occurred for example in the latter stages of the long 1975-80
expansion. Productivity gains narrowed from 3% in 1976, to
1.8% in 1977, and to 0.9% in 1978. And then, in the upturn's
final year, the gains disappeared. In the final quarter of
1979, the last of the expansion, productivity fell at an
annual rate of 2.2%.
   If a recession should develop in coming weeks, as some
economists predict, history shows the recent decline in
productivity could well be followed by further sharp drops.
Productivity fell at an annual rate of 2.6% in the 1980
second quarter, the low point of that year's recession, and
output dropped at annual rate of 5.8% in the early months of
the 1981-82 recession, which preceded the current expansion.
   More likely than a recession, in the view of many
forecasters, is that as the year winds down the economy will
continue to expand sluggishly and productivity will follow
suit. The anticipated gains will fail to match hourly pay
increases, and so profits will remain under pressure as labor
costs climb.
   Already on the increase, labor costs per unit of output
rose 4.5% last year, up from 2.7% in 1988 and 2.6% in 1987.
The 1989 rise was the sharpest gain since 1982, a recession
year.
   Some economists note that productivity gains have also
narrowed abroad in recent years, for much the same reasons as
in the U.S. However, the record abroad is generally superior
to the U.S. performance.
   A Richmond Federal Reserve Bank study shows that in a
recent seven-year interval the productivity of U.S.
businesses rose only 0.6% annually, compared with gains of
2.8% in Japan, 2.4% in France, 2% in West Germany and 1.9% in
Britain. The report also shows that the rate of private fixed
investment in the U.S., at about 15% of gross national
product, has persistently trailed comparable rates abroad.
For example, the rate in Japan has ranged near 25% and in
West Germany around 20%.
   Kurt Richebacher, an economic consultant based in Zurich,
blames America's "retarded productivity growth" largely on
"the abysmal performance of U.S. savings and investment
during the 1980s." Investment, he adds, "is the wellspring of
productivity growth."
   For all the dark spots, it should be added that the U.S.
productivity picture is not without a few bright ones. While
productivity growth has lagged behind in the U.S., in
absolute terms U.S. productivity remains at the top in global
rankings.
   On a per-employee basis, for example, economic output in
Japan in 1989 came to only 72.7% of the U.S. level, according
to Labor Department data. Other comparable rates were 82% in
West Germany, 85.9% in France, 39.8% in South Korea, 87.3% in
Italy, 71.5% in Britain, 77.2% in the Netherlands, 67.7% in
Sweden, and 94% in Canada.
   In addition, there are increasing signs that individual
U.S. companies -- in services as well as in manufacturing --
are finding new ways to spur productivity.
   In the Webster, N.Y., plant of Xerox Corp., for example,
robots long used to paint copiers recently were assigned such
relatively sophisticated tasks as welding.
   And American Express Co. recently increased productivity
of its personnel through faster settlement of billing
disputes. For instance, when a credit-card holder in Florida
with a good credit record ordered a ring from a Chicago
jeweler, the ring arrived with a stone missing.
   "Under our old rules, there would have been exchanges of
letters taking weeks," says Roger H. Ballou, president of the
firm's travel-services group. "But not now -- we got busy
with fax and phone messages and in three days the client had
the ring fixed and back."

   Tax on Energy
   Is Being Pushed

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is pushing a
broad-based new tax on energy as a way to help close the
budget gap, according to administration and congressional
officials.
   The tax, known as a BTU tax (for British thermal unit, the
measure of energy), would apply to various sources of energy,
including gasoline, oil, natural gas and nuclear and
hydroelectric power. On gasoline, the proposal being
discussed would amount to an increase of five or six cents a
gallon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If adopted by the budget summit, the proposal would
probably be the single largest revenue-raiser in the
deficit-cutting package, bringing in an estimated $20 billion
a year.
   Some Democrats are resisting the energy excise tax, saying
it is "regressive" -- that it falls more heavily on
low-income taxpayers than on high-income taxpayers. But
administration officials have been arguing that the tax isn't
so regressive. They say the tax would fall in roughly equal
proportion to income for most taxpayers, except for the very
poor and the very wealthy.
   Moreover, the BTU tax has political advantages over a
straight increase in the gasoline tax, in that it would
spread the burden more broadly over various energy users. The
federal gasoline tax is currently 9.1 cents a gallon.
   The BTU tax is included in a budget proposal that Sen.
Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) has drafted and plans to offer in
the coming weeks. Sen. Domenici is an ally of the Bush
administration, and works with it closely on budget matters.
   The budget negotiators are still far from agreement, and
various tax proposals are certain to rise and fall before a
final deal is cut. But for the moment, the BTU tax seems to
be near the top of the administration's agenda and has
supporters in Congress as well.
   In addition to an energy tax, the administration has made
it clear it wants any tax package to include a cut in the
capital-gains tax rate. And Democrats are certain to demand
some new tax on high-income Americans to offset the effects
of a capital-gains cut, which many Democrats believe is a
giveaway to the rich.
   The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that the
administration is considering a tax on the sale of securities
as one way to hit high-income taxpayers. Congressional
officials say the proposal would probably put the tax in the
neighborhood of 15 cents per $100 of traded securities.
   Asked about the securities tax at a briefing for financial
reporters yesterday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said
only that tax-revenue plans are subject to negotiations with
Congress. "I'm not going to comment on any of the individual
taxes or lack of taxes or any part of the negotiations," Mr.
Brady said.
   The Bush administration's interest in the BTU tax is said
to be tied to the president's desire to help the environment.
A tax on the consumption of energy would discourage its
excessive use and help the environment.
   Many congressional Democrats support the tax for the same
reason. For example, Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.), a senior
member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee,
currently is working on a bill that would impose a
broad-based energy tax, such as a BTU tax, as a
pro-environment proposal.
   What's more, a BTU tax might be more readily accepted by
the powerful lobbying groups that vehemently oppose more
targeted energy taxes, such as an increased tax on gasoline.
"We are not in favor of any tax increase at this point," said
Kenneth Simonson, chief economist of the American Trucking
Associations. "But our view is, the broader the tax is spread
the better."

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- CCAIR Inc., a commuter airline that
feeds passengers to USAir, said it filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, citing cash-flow
problems.
   CCAIR, which is among several carriers that does business
as USAir Express, said it has suffered a cash squeeze since
USAir, the Arlington, Va.-based carrier with which it has a
marketing agreement, began paying it on a monthly basis
instead of weekly. The switch came after USAir Group Inc.,
the parent of USAir, acquired Piedmont Airlines, the carrier
that CCAIR had cooperated with.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Our traffic is good and we've got a lot of good
employees," said J. Edward Bacon Jr., vice president-sales
and services at CCAIR. "It's basically just a cash-flow
problem."
   Mr. Bacon said negotiations for a line of credit recently
fell through, prompting the bankruptcy-law petition, which
was filed yesterday in federal bankruptcy court here. He said
the bankruptcy filing listed assets of $26 million and
liabilities of $13 million. He said the commuter line is
continuing to operate.
   A USAir spokeswoman wouldn't comment. The two carriers are
unrelated in ownership, but have a marketing agreement under
which CCAIR provides commuter feeder service to USAir at its
Charlotte hub. CCAIR flies to 23 cities in North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia and West
Virginia.
   For the third quarter ended March 31, CCAIR had a loss of
$1.5 million, or 26 cents a share, on revenue of $15.5
million. That compared with a loss of $350,999, or seven
cents a share, on revenue of $13.7 million in the
year-earlier period.
   Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate under
protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan
to pay its debts.

   Economic Summit Pits U.S. Against Europe
   On Environment, Soviet Aid and Farm Subsidies

   WASHINGTON -- The unlikely trio of farm subsidies, Soviet
aid and global warming threatens to spoil President Bush's
get-together in Houston next week with leaders of his six
Western allies.
   The economic summit will pit the U.S. against the European
countries on each of these major issues. For Mr. Bush, the
host of the summit, it will be difficult to emerge unbruised.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On agriculture, the U.S. wants to use the summit to push
for an agreement with its allies to eliminate most farm
subsidies, an issue it feels is crucial to breaking the
deadlock in the current round of international trade talks.
But on that score, it faces heavy resistance from France,
Italy, West Germany and Britain.
   On Soviet aid, it's the West Germans and the French who
are eager to use the summit to push for immediate action. The
U.S. urges waiting for more Soviet commitment to
market-oriented economic reform before shelling out money
that the U.S. fears would be wasted.
   And on the environment, the Europeans, led by the West
Germans, want to agree on steps to cut back "greenhouse"
gases, which many scientists fear will raise the Earth's
temperature by trapping too much heat from the sun and cause
possibly dramatic climate changes. The most troubling
greenhouse gases are the result of burning fossil fuels like
coal and oil, and steps to curb these emissions would have
big economic impacts. But the Bush administration isn't
convinced by the European arguments and stresses the need for
more research as well as proven environmental measures like
energy conservation and tree-planting.
   The likely outcome: a summit of heavy quarreling and hard
bargaining between the U.S. and Europe on issues that are
crucial to the future world order. The two other summit
countries -- Canada and Japan -- generally lean toward the
U.S. position on the major issues, with Canada being
particularly supportive on the need for far-reaching
agricultural reform.
   Yet, however bad the tiffs between the summit countries on
these major issues, it's likely they'll all sign off on a
final communique that carefully papers over their differences
on these and other subjects.
   "Any summit is a snapshot of international negotiations in
the economic and political world in that year, and this year
there are three or four processes that are in a critical
stage," Richard McCormack, undersecretary for economic and
agricultural affairs at the State Department, said in an
interview. Progress on these issues at this summit will
require tough talking between the leaders themselves.
   "This isn't a technicians' summit, but a summit of
political leaders" said Mr. McCormack, who is President
Bush's sherpa -- as guides to Himalayan summits are known --
for the second year.
   The Houston summit will be a sharp contrast to last year's
celebration in Paris, which coincided with the bicentenary of
the French Revolution, when the leaders had so little left to
discuss that they even canceled their final dinner and went
their separate ways half a day early.
   The agriculture issue is particularly important because
lack of agreement threatens to undermine the current Uruguay
Round of talks under the world's trade treaty, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Those talks, begun in 1986 in
Punta del Este in Uruguay, aim to rewrite the world's trade
rules, extending them to cover practically all of the globe's
commerce. They are scheduled to conclude in December in
Brussels.
   The U.S. is adamant about the need for reform in
agriculture. "Trying to get agreement on going forward
fruitfully on the Uruguay Round would be very important to me
and all of us here," President Bush told reporters recently,
"and I'd put that at the top" of the Houston agenda, he
added.
   Earlier this week, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
said the U.S. most wants "a recognition by European
participants that agriculture is key to the round." She also
noted that the spat over agriculture pits the European
Community against practically all the world's other
food-exporting nations.
   Without progress on agricultural reform, the U.S. fears
that many developing countries will desert the GATT talks and
that there will be a breakdown of the freetrading system
leading to "more unilateralism, and a couple of years of real
excitement" before negotiations could begin anew, Mr.
McCormack said.
   But the Europeans remain leery of any reforms in
agriculture that will cut into their $9 billion a year of
export subsidies, or into the billions of dollars they spend
on price supports. The former are particularly helpful to the
big exports of France's relatively efficient farmers, while
the latter help to protect West Germany's relatively
inefficient agriculture.
   A senior European Commission official told reporters
yesterday that the Europeans wouldn't bring to Houston new
initiatives on farm subsidies but would continue to push for
a recognition that "our agricultural systems are different."
He said EC President Jacques Delors would seek to impress on
President Bush that the EC can't eliminate its subsidies as
the U.S. would like it to.
   The crumbling Soviet economy also is dividing the allies.
West Germany, eager for Soviet endorsement of its planned
union with East Germany, recently lent Moscow five billion
marks ($3.03 billion), and is canvassing for more Western
aid. France also is keen to help the Soviets. But the U.S.,
Canada, Japan and Britain remain opposed. "None of our
bilateral issues are solved," says a Japanese government
official discussing his country's relations with the Soviet
Union.
   Moreover, the European Community itself hasn't yet put
together a Soviet-aid plan. At its recent summit in Dublin,
the EC agreed to study the issue and come up with a proposal
by October.
   The U.S. and the Europeans, along with other developed
nations, already are moving together to deal with one
world-wide environmental problem: the depletion of the
Earth's protective ozone layer, which shields out the sun's
harmful ultraviolet rays.
   But greenhouse gases and threats of global warming pose a
stickier issue that still is likely to cloud the summit
atmosphere. The U.S. is spending massive amounts of money on
researching the global-warming issue and wants to wait until
it gets what it considers conclusive results.
   On all three key issues -- agricultural trade, Soviet aid
and the environment -- West Germany, Europe's emerging
superpower, is unlikely to want to offend Mr. Bush. "You
shouldn't forget that German unification is Chancellor Kohl's
top priority, and we have been very supportive of him," says
a senior U.S. administration official, discussing the Houston
summit.
   And Mr. Bush himself appreciates the variety of opinions
in the group. "Nobody says we've got to move in lockstep on
all of this," he told reporters recently. "I have great
respect for Kohl, and great respect for Mrs. Thatcher's
approach, and Mitterrand's approach, all of them. I think
there are nuances of difference there. But that doesn't
weaken the prospects for the economic summit. Those aren't
dividing issues that are going to render us asunder from the
Brits, or the French, or the Canadians, who look at some of
these issues a little differently."

   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Altos Computer Systems said it agreed
in principle to be acquired by Acer Group, a Taiwan computer
maker, for $94 million.
   The $8.35-a-share offer is considerably higher than the
range of $4.87 a share to $7.37 a share that Altos stock has
traded in since January. However, news of the offer sharply
pushed up Altos's share price in national over-the-counter
trading yesterday. The stock closed at $8.25, up 87.5 cents
from Tuesday's close of $7.375.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Altos, which had been shopping for a suitor, first
disclosed its discussions with Acer last week. The U.S.
company, a maker of multiuser computer networks, has stumbled
in recent quarters, the result of bloated inventories and
higher-than-anticipated costs associated with new products.
   Under the terms of the buy-out, Altos would be operated as
a separate unit of Acer, maintaining its own corporate name
and products. The Acer offer gives Altos "the critical mass
and name recognition" it needs to grow, said Ron Conway,
president of Altos.
   Acer, a maker of IBM-compatible computers, said the
buy-out would help Acer improve the systems capabilities of
its laptop and notebook-size computers. Acer is Taiwan's
largest computer maker, with more than $700 million in
revenue; the company has a network of 10,000 dealers in more
than 70 countries.
   Altos designs, makes and markets multiuser computer
networks for distribution in about 60 countries. For its
third fiscal quarter ended March 31, the company posted a net
loss of $1.7 million, or 16 cents a share, on sales of $32.6
million. A year earlier, it had a loss of $3.7 million, or 31
cents a share, on revenue of $32.4 million.

   WASHINGTON -- The American Institute of Architects, a
Washington trade group, settled federal antitrust charges
that it had discouraged competitive bidding and discounts by
its 55,000 members.
   Although the AIA denied any wrongdoing, it agreed to a
proposed court order that would block it from barring or
deterring architects from competitive bidding, discounting
fees and providing free services.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposed court order, or consent decree, was filed in
federal court in Washington by the Justice Department and
requires a judge's approval. The decree would settle civil
charges by the department, including the allegation that the
Chicago chapter of the AIA in 1984 adopted a policy statement
prohibiting practices such as competitive bidding and
discounting. Federal antitrust prosecutors had investigated
the group for four years.
   David Perdue, the AIA's associate general counsel, said
such statements "reflected anxieties and concerns about
financial returns of {architectural} firms" in the mid-1980s.
But he insisted that the policy statements hadn't affected
architects' fees. Mr. Perdue said the AIA agreed to the
consent decree to prevent the cost and distraction of a
trial. The decree would require the architects group to pay
$50,000 to the government for the expense of its
investigation. Mr. Perdue said the group has already spent $2
million in legal fees in connection with the investigation.
   The Justice Department investigated alleged antitrust
violations by the AIA in the early 1970s. That inquiry
resulted in a narrower consent decree barring restrictions on
competitive bidding.
