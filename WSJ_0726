   National Intergroup Seems to Have Lost
   Three Board Seats to Dissident Holder

   PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. apparently lost the
chairman's board seat and two others to dissident shareholder
Centaur Partners Group, which claimed it won a mandate for
its plan to liquidate the company.
   But Centaur would have only a minority voice on the
10-person board, and must convince directors, particularly
independent members, to go along. Although the final vote
won't be known until Aug. 9, Centaur is believed to have
received at least two-thirds of the votes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Centaur, which owns 16.5% of National Intergroup, said it
wouldn't rush into a fire sale of FoxMeyer Drug, the
wholesale-drug distribution operation and essentially
National Intergroup's only ongoing business. Still, "we think
it's in the best interest to pursue a potential sale of
FoxMeyer in a responsible way," said Melvyn J. Estrin, a
principal of Centaur, who was elected to the board. "We think
the shareholder vote is a mandate."
   Management has argued that an immediate sale wouldn't
capture the potential value for FoxMeyer, which has lagged
its competitors but is improving. Indeed, FoxMeyer's sales
rose 23% and operating earnings surged 40% in the first
quarter ended June 30.
   Still, Mr. Estrin estimated that FoxMeyer, with its 11
distribution centers, could fetch between $475 million and
$525 million, or at least $21 a share.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
National Intergroup common stock closed unchanged at $18 a
share.
   Centaur's apparent win likely marks the end of an
embattled tenure for Howard M. Love, the company's chairman
and chief executive officer, who helped steer the company
from steel and aluminum into retail, oil, financial services
and ultimately wholesale-drug distribution. Up until now, Mr.
Love has managed to fend off dissatisfied shareholders,
frustrated with seven consecutive years of operating losses;
he even won an earlier proxy fight in the mid-1980s.
   Still, he conceded the grand plan of becoming a drug
wholesaler has taken "far longer than I had anticipated."
Although disappointed in the vote, he said he hopes the
company continues to operate FoxMeyer "without a lot of
bickering on the board."
   He wouldn't say whether he would step down as chief
executive before his planned retirement in March. However, he
will likely have to relinquish his title as chairman.
   Yesterday's shareholder meeting culminates a proxy fight
that included several lawsuits and seven months of litigation
challenging the company's anti-takeover "poison pill" plan
and bylaws regarding board size. In that time, the company
announced a major restructuring that called for the sale of
its Ben Franklin general merchandise franchise chain and
Permian Partners L.P. oil operation, with proceeds going
towards a special dividend and share buy-back program. The
plan, which the company had hoped would console impatient
investors, also called for Mr. Love's retirement next spring.
   But the plan failed to impress shareholders, who noted
that they haven't been paid a dividend since the fourth
quarter of 1988. Meanwhile Mr. Love received a $300,000 bonus
in 1990 and options to buy 325,000 shares at $16.80 each.
   "You ask for support against Centaur. Do you deserve it?"
asked Eugene Cohen at the meeting; Mr. Cohen owns more stock
than any director besides Mr. Love. National Intergroup
directors own less than 1% of the company's stock
outstanding.
   The two other Centaur-nominated directors are Robert J.
Slater, former vice chairman of Crane Co. and William G.
Tull, former president of American Security Bank.
   Separately, National Intergroup said that as a result of
the closing of its Pittsburgh headquarters and the sale of
its Ben Franklin and Permian units, it would "incur
significant losses which will negatively impact first-quarter
results." The company declined to say whether it would post a
net loss. In last year's first quarter ended June 30,
National Intergroup earned $13 million, or 53 cents a share,
on revenue of $853.5 million.

   NEW YORK -- The quarterly study of asset-allocation by The
Wall Street Journal and Wilshire Associates of Santa Monica,
Calif., includes the 10 brokerage houses that had the largest
number of registered representatives at the time they were
selected.
   Some firms publish more than one set of asset-allocation
recommendations. Within reason, they may pick which set they
want to be judged by, provided they specify in advance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A.G. Edwards is judged on a "growth and income" portfolio,
Kidder Peabody on an "individual balanced" portfolio, and
PaineWebber on a "typical balanced portfolio."
   Raymond James is judged on its advice to "young urban
professionals," Goldman Sachs on advice for a "smaller,
aggressive pension fund," and Prudential-Bache on its
recommendations for a "small, aggressive fund."
   The four other firms -- Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch,
Shearson and Smith Barney -- publish only one set of
asset-allocation advice, which can be modified to fit
individual clients' needs.
   Each house's advice is mirrored in a theoretical
portfolio. Holdings are adjusted whenever the advice changes,
and also on the last day of each month, to keep assets in the
recommended ratio.
   Investments are assumed to do as well as the following
indexes: Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index for stocks;
Merrill Lynch corporate and government master bond index for
bonds; 90-day Treasury bills for cash; the National Council
of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries/Frank Russell Co. index
for real estate; and the average monthly price of gold for
tangible assets.
   The study disregards the cost of trading, mainly to make
the results comparable to market averages. In practice,
people who often adjust their investment blends may incur
high commissions.

   Stotler to Stop
   Brokering Futures

   CHICAGO -- Financially crippled Stotler Group Inc. said it
was pulling out of the futures brokerage business after
defaulting on $750,000 in short-term commercial paper
obligations.
   Stotler's announcement highlighted the precarious
financial underpinnings of many local futures trading firms,
whose capital accounts haven't kept pace with the exponential
growth in futures trading during the past decade. The
company's slide to the brink of insolvency also raises
questions about the ability and willingness of futures
industry regulators to rein in the activities of
well-established brokerage firms, said senior officials at
other futures brokerage firms here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We still don't have any idea how this could have happened
so quickly," said the head of a rival futures brokerage
house, who asked to remain anonymous.
   Stotler Group, whose chairman, Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, is
also chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, said it faces an
additional $7.6 million in debt payments in the next 30 days.
Stotler said it is weighing "all available options" to try to
shore up its finances, including restructuring or refinancing
its debt and selling subsidiaries and assets.
   Stotler's rapid decline over the past two weeks has been a
blow to Mr. Mahlmann's prestige and his wallet. The taciturn
executive, who prides himself on his organizational acumen,
is serving his third consecutive one-year term as the top
elected official of the world's largest futures exchange.
   He is also believed to have a substantial portion of his
net worth tied up in Stotler Group stock, which plunged to
$2.50 a share Tuesday on the American Stock Exchange, after
trading at about $8 a share two weeks ago. The stock didn't
open for trading yesterday. Mr. Mahlmann owns about 10% of
the outstanding shares of Stotler Group, according to
regulatory filings.
   Stotler said it would wind down its futures brokerage
business "in an orderly manner over the coming days." Stotler
officials didn't respond to calls seeking elaboration.
   Stotler Group officials have scrambled the past two weeks
to hold the company together after the Board of Trade said
its principal subsidiary, Stotler &amp; Co., had failed to meet
capital requirements. Futures industry regulations require
firms that clear and guarantee customer trades to maintain a
capital cushion equal to at least 4% of customer-segregated
funds.
   The default apparently was triggered when the company
failed on Monday to secure a capital infusion of about $10
million from a Taiwanese investor. To reduce its regulatory
capital requirements, Stotler &amp; Co. on Tuesday gave up its
clearing memberships on all major futures exchanges. The firm
said it would clear its futures trades through another
futures firm, Brody, White &amp; Co.
   During much of the past two weeks, the firm was furiously
shipping customer accounts to other futures brokers to reduce
the amount of capital it was required to carry on its books.
The company said it reduced its customer funds to $120
million from $290 million.
   Neither Stotler Group nor the Board of Trade have said
what caused the futures brokerage firm's failure to meet
capital requirements. Board of Trade members said the problem
appeared to stem from a dispute with regulators regarding
what assets could be counted as regulatory capital and how
that capital should be apportioned among the Stotler Group
holding company, the Stotler &amp; Co. unit and other
subsidiaries.
   Futures industry officials said it was unclear how Stotler
Group's Des Moines, Iowa, securities subsidiary, R.G.
Dickinson &amp; Co., has been affected by its parent company's
woes. Stotler Group bought Dickinson after the small
broker-dealer underwrote Stotler Group's initial public stock
offering in 1988. Dickinson officials didn't return calls
seeking comment.

   ATLANTA -- It is early evening in an addicts' shooting
gallery on the northwest side of this city, and Dottie Burns
has something to say: "You all know me," she announces to the
bleary-eyed group in the kitchen of a shabby apartment. "I
used to come here and do dope myself. I care for you and
don't want you to die."
   Nearby, a woman quietly pulls a syringe from a vein in her
left arm and lays it on the table. Ms. Burns doesn't flinch.
Instead she launches off into her warnings about drug use,
and starts handing out bleach for cleaning needles, condoms
for safe sex and brochures that recount the dangers of AIDS.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Burns, 35 years old, is part of a growing movement in
the inner city, one that relies on so-called self-help
programs to contend with some of the intractable problems of
urban America. Now drug-free and looking healthy in her
turtleneck and pressed jeans, she has returned to this past
haunt as part of a team of recovering addicts with Outreach
Inc., a local organization trying to fight the spread of AIDS
among inner-city blacks.
   Outreach is just one of hundreds of self-help programs
that have sprung up to tackle the worsening problems of the
poor. Those efforts can hardly solve the inner-city's
problems on their own. Yet, they reflect a growing sense that
the best strategies for dealing with urban social decay are
often home-grown, and that government programs have, in many
cases, simply failed.
   "Self-help is definitely the solution," says Julia Hare, a
San Francisco educator who has written about black family
life. "Government isn't going to do it, and I'm not sure
government should do it."
   Adds Dorothy Height, president of the National Council of
Negro Women: "There is no way to deal with these problems
without rediscovering some of the traditional values and
historic strengths that have brought us this far and have
been the base of our survival." Last January, the council
telecast a three-hour conference on self-help that was
carried on more than 20 cable and public-access television
channels across the country.
   The idea of self-help is hardly new to urban black
communities. During decades of segregation, when normal
services were denied them, blacks in the U.S. formed their
own stores, insurance companies and other businesses.
Integration would permit the more affluent and better
educated to move away and start new lives, but it also
siphoned off the role models from the old neighborhoods. As
the inner city disintegrated, the self-help network crumbled,
too.
   Federal poverty programs have offered a partial safety
net. Yet, "government is not the generator, it's the
facilitator," insists U.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume, a Democrat from
Maryland. "It's not going to generate our change."
   And as for the mainstay civil rights organizations, such
as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, many former members complain they have grown so large
and bureaucratic that they have lost touch with the black
community. Kenneth Powell, 43, a St. Louis dentist and
businessman, recently resigned from the local board of the
NAACP. His reason: The old-line organizations "don't
represent the people in the community anymore," he contends.
Dr. Powell, who is still an NAACP member, worries that the
group is top-heavy with older leaders who have failed to step
aside for a younger, more progressive generation.
   NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks sees things
differently. The group's community service, job training and
educational programs keep it in touch with its black
constituency, he says. "We have got to rise up and take
responsibility for our own destiny," he told the NAACP annual
convention in Los Angeles this month, sounding the self-help
theme. "Our foreparents didn't spend all of their time
whining and crying about what they didn't have. They took the
little bit they did have and made something out of it. We are
their children, and we must do the same."
   Increasingly, that's exactly what groups in the inner city
are doing.
                                                                                                       

   A Mentor for the Young
                                                                                                       

   Richard Rowe, a 39-year-old director of a youth program in
Baltimore, says he used to get depressed when he drove
through the city's ghetto in the mid-1980s. There, he saw
"scores and scores" of black men standing on street corners
and outside liquor stores, he says. Mr. Rowe, who at the time
worked for the local chapter of the Urban League, decided the
problem was "a void in programs, initiativesa vision for
African-American males."
   He decided to help fill that void himself, though he said
he got "some resistance" from his Urban League superiors. Mr.
Rowe formed the Afrikan American Men's Leadership Council,
which matches black youths aged 11 to 14 with black male
adults who then act as role models. The youths undergo a
yearlong "rite of passage" based loosely on coming-of-age
ceremonies in African tribal tradition. However, instead of
slaying a lion, goals include improving school attendance and
grades and taking a role in community service.
   The mentors range from professionals to blue-collar
workers. One is an ex-convict and reformed jewelry thief, who
says he wants "to act as a catalyst to divert {children} from
that experience."
   Mr. Rowe considers himself lucky. A college graduate, he
grew up in a stable home where both his mother and father
were supportive of him and his five siblings. Although his
father worked two jobs, as a janitor and a carpenter, "I got
the chance to see a man interact with his family," he says.
   Now, Mr. Rowe tries to share that kind of relationship
with his new charges. One of them is Jamaal Jackson, 14. For
years, Jamaal's mother, Theresita, who is divorced, worried
that the drug problem encroaching on her neighborhood might
sweep up her son. "As a black single parent I didn't have a
real male image for my son," she says. "While I had 1,000
things for my daughter to do, I knew I needed some type of
outlet for him, that I couldn't constantly try and do it on
my own."
   So she enrolled him in the mentoring program. For Jamaal,
it was a year of discovery. His mentors took him on trips to
museums, helped him with his homework and discussed proper
conduct. The program "taught me a lot about brotherhood and
the black race, about self-discipline," he says. "I respect
black history and culture more now. And, I respect my parents
and my peers."
   Earlier this year, Mr. Rowe's group helped sponsor a
conference on black males and self-help at Morgan State
College in Baltimore, Mr. Rowe's alma mater. The program drew
some 300 people, including a group of teen-age boys from the
city's St. Frances Charles Hall High School. The boys have
started their own effort to encourage positive behavior among
their peers. "We don't want to see them stand on the corner
selling drugs to make their money," says Joseph Alston, 18, a
senior who says he once dealt drugs himself. "We want to see
them going to work, trying to better themselves."
   It's one more attempt at self-help, says Mr. Rowe. As for
his own mentoring program, only 12 of the 30 boys who signed
up graduated, but he says he isn't discouraged. "A lot of
boys aren't prepared for this kind of rigorous program," he
says. Nonetheless, he is already recruiting mentors for next
year's group. "I'm no longer looking outside our family, our
community, for solutions," he says.
                                                                                                       

   Working Inside the System
                                                                                                       

   When Lisa Y. Sullivan arrived at Yale in 1983 to begin
graduate studies in political science, she intended to focus
on her studies. But that quickly changed.
   Public projects housing some of the poorest blacks in New
Haven, Conn., were little more than a stone's throw from
Yale's ivy-draped campus, and Ms. Sullivan couldn't help but
notice the stark contrast. In Washington, D.C., where she
grew up, Ms. Sullivan says she had known slums, "but nothing
like what I saw in New Haven."
   The 28-year-old Ms. Sullivan decided to find a way to make
a contribution. Reared on the virtues of the NAACP (she was
treasurer of the NAACP chapter at Clark College in Atlanta),
she sought out the New Haven chapter and its youth council.
She was in for a surprise.
   At the first meeting of the chapter she attended, she
says, "everybody there was over 60. Nobody was really doing
anything with the youth council." The local chapter, she
contends, "had lost visibility and credibility in New Haven's
black community."
   When Ms. Sullivan and Kevin Houston, 30, a student at
Yale's Divinity School, started bringing in new members from
the housing projects and enlisting them in a voter
registration drive, some old-guard tempers flared. During one
tumultuous chapter meeting, Mr. Houston refused to yield the
floor, and some angry older members began to sing hymns to
drown him out. "We pushed the black middle class in this town
to the limit about their having rejected the black
community," Ms. Sullivan says.
   The two, she says, were accused of "going berserk" with
the youth group, especially when they announced they would
recruit more members from the housing projects in preference
to "middle-class kids who belong to umpteen organizations
already." She says the chapter's conservative members worried
about the organization's image: "We now had young men with
gold chains and high top fades {a hair style} saying they
were officers in the NAACP youth council." Ms. Sullivan says
she found that, among children in the ghetto, the NAACP "was
only a historical reference point. They had never been
approached" by the organization.
   Choosing his words carefully, Haywood Hooks, a 65-year-old
research chemist elected president of the local chapter in
1984, says, "I think some of the ideas they had weren't in
keeping with the policies and practices of the NAACP. The
kind of things they wanted to do, the elderly members didn't
see them doing it that way." However, Mr. Hooks admits that
before Ms. Sullivan arrived, the youth council "was very much
in limbo."
   These days, however, Mr. Hooks calls Ms. Sullivan and Mr.
Houston "indispensable" to the NAACP's efforts. Ms. Sullivan
alone has raised more than $30,000 this year for the local
chapter, he notes.
   Ms. Sullivan and Mr. Houston have enrolled nearly 150
children, mostly black and between the ages of 12 and 17, in
their youth program. They have taken youngsters on
out-of-town trips to NAACP conferences and black cultural
events, enrolled children in tutorial programs and started
discussion groups on black history and self-esteem. Recently,
they took a group to a Yale Repertory performance of "Two
Trains Running," a play by August Wilson, a black Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwright.
   Mr. Houston, who wears his hair in dreadlocks and favors
African-style clothing, has since dropped out of divinity
school to work full time with youth. "The truth is," he says,
"the whole community is at risk."

   A Personal Mission
                                                                                                       

   Dottie Burns is of like mind, which is why she spends her
time prowling Atlanta's neighborhoods looking for drug
addicts to help.
   Ms. Burns, the product of a broken family in Atlanta,
began using drugs when she was 14. Over the next several
years, she would graduate from popping tranquilizers to
shooting heroin. She would lose her job, bear a daughter and
be repeatedly arrested for stealing to support her habit.
   In 1988, she was put in jail for parole violation, and
there she began her withdrawal from drugs. "I remember
throwing up, chills, being hot and restless. But I got my
first spiritual awakening. I made up my mind that that was
it. I got busy thinking about what I needed to do to never
have to come back" to jail.
   The best way, she figured, was to become a role model, an
example for other addicts of how to beat drugs. She finished
a rehabilitation program and joined Outreach Inc. Now when
she talks to addicts in the ghetto, "It's not `Look at me,
look at how good I look.' It's `Look at me. You've seen me
before. You can change too.' They're a part of my life, a
part of me I don't want to forget."
   Outreach Inc. got its start from another Atlantan who
believed self-help offered a powerful means of influencing
life in the depressed inner city. Sandra McDonald, who once
sold cosmetics door to door, founded the organization in
1986, handing out AIDS literature from her car and preaching
the virtues of clean needles and safe sex.
   Today, sitting in Outreach's storefront headquarters on
busy Martin Luther King Drive, a central artery through this
city's black community, she recalls how she grew up here in a
different world. "I remember in school, some kids had no
decent clothes. The teacher would make a quiet announcement
that clothes were available. They saw a need and took care of
it -- very quietly."
   Her maternal grandmother was a midwife, part of a
community network in which neighbors knew and cared for each
other, Ms. McDonald recalls. "Her example was not to wait for
anybody to do it for you -- do it yourself." Through
Outreach, "we apply that same philosophy we grew up with and
take it to the people who most need it," she says.
   While the 43-year-old Ms. McDonald has never been a
substance abuser, all but two of her staff of 17 are
recovering from drug or alcohol addiction. Three have AIDS.
Last year they passed out 82,800 pieces of literature and
180,000 condoms in 47 neighborhoods in the city. Says Ms.
McDonald: "We've been in the streets long enough now to build
a real bond with the communities."
   For those involved in self-help at its rawest level, that
bonding can be a painful experience. Outreach's Dottie Burns
confesses that she sometimes finds it difficult emotionally
to talk to addicts about AIDS. It recalls anguished memories
of her own addiction, and of friends who have died.
   But her past is still her best asset in her line of work,
she says. "If you don't have that rapport you wouldn't
accomplish anything. I know that I'm just one shot away from
getting high and being right back down there with them."

   NEW YORK -- Investors nudged stock prices higher, and did
so in a way that suggests their appetite may be waning for
some of the consumer-products growth stocks that led the
market's recent rally.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.42 points in
active trading to 2930.94. Bond prices gained and the dollar
strengthened in response to data indicating the U.S. economy
isn't picking up steam.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The stock market derived much of its support from a
rebound in technology stocks and strength in industrial
materials and precious metals issues. For example, Alcoa,
Phelps Dodge and Union Carbide all posted gains, while
consumer stocks such as Coca-cola, Pepsi-Co and Philip Morris
fell.
   Joseph McAlinden, director of equity research at Dillon
Read, predicted that for the rest of the summer technology
and natural-resources stocks -- along with energy stocks,
which fell yesterday on profit-taking -- will push the market
higher. He said he expects these groups to take turns
bolstering broad market measures.
   The sharp drop in the stock market Monday "was a decisive
crack in the one-decision stocks," Mr. McAlinden said,
referring to the relatively few reliable growth stocks about
which the only decision is to buy. The turning point was
McDonald's earnings report Friday; profits were one cent a
share shy of some analysts' estimates. "So now we're getting
some pickup in stocks that do well in an inflationary
environment," he said, which is less favorable for growth
companies.
   The rise in bond prices -- up three-eighths of a point, or
$3.75 for each $1,000 face amount -- was sparked by a
weaker-than-expected durable-goods orders in June. Helping
sustain the market's advance was a comment later in the day
from one Federal Reserve governor, which traders interpreted
to mean the Fed will continue to favor fighting inflation
over preventing recession.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices rose on volume of 163.5 million shares in New
York Stock Exchange trading. Advancing issues outnumbered
decliners, 895 to 583.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.54%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar gained. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6250 marks and 149.89 yen, compared with
1.6215 marks and 148.78 yen Tuesday.

   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan to Sell

   May Be Risky for U.S.

   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association agreed to sell its
huge junk-bond portfolio to a Canadian investor group at an
unexpectedly high price, but the proposed financing of the
transaction carries some risk for the U.S. taxpayer.
   Edward G. Harshfield, Columbia's chief executive officer,
said a partnership associated with Gordon Investment Corp.
agreed to pay $3 billion for the thrift's portfolio of junk
bonds and preferred stock. Gordon is a largely
employee-owned, Toronto-based merchant bank that numbers
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and a General Electric Co.
subsidiary among its investors. The portfolio was valued at
$2.93 billion at March 31, after a plunge that dumped $890
million of losses on Columbia, rendering it insolvent.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Selling such a large amount of junk bonds into the
battered and illiquid junk-bond market was considered
improbable just weeks ago. But that market has recovered
slightly, and Columbia offered unexpectedly favorable terms:
90% financing on a so-called non-recourse basis. That means
that the buyer can walk away from the portfolio if additional
losses exceed 10%, and the seller will in effect have to take
the bonds back. The financing and the limited risk is mainly
what motivated Gordon to pay Columbia a slight premium for a
portfolio that many investment bankers thought would have to
be discounted a further 10% to 15%.
   The feat could save Columbia, or at least sharply reduce
or even eliminate government losses if the Beverly Hills,
Calif., thrift were to fail. Moreover, the transaction could
prove a model for dispensing with about $4 billion more of
junk bonds that the government has inherited from seized
thrifts.
   But the plan carries considerable risk for the government,
which would inherit the junk bonds if the market turns sour
again, forcing Gordon to return them to a Columbia that would
then be doomed to an even more expensive failure. Regulators
and congressmen therefore might oppose the transaction.
   "Almost as dubious as the purchase of junk bonds with
taxpayer-insured deposits is financing of junk bonds with
insured deposits, especially on a non-recourse basis," said
Rep. Jim Leach (R., Iowa). "Given the circumstances, this may
wind up being a reasonable deal for the government. But as
attractive as the bold print of this deal may be, the fine
print seems questionable."
   Mr. Leach also questioned whether the Columbia deal should
become a model for the government's future management of its
current junk-bond portfolio. "The idea should be to move this
industry out of junk bonds" and other forms of "roulette
finance," he remarked. The Columbia deal "may be a
conceivable approach in some instances, but it's not at all
desirable," he said.
   Columbia has two other big problems: it still needs to
raise an estimated $300 million or so in additional capital
to meet regulatory standards. It can raise a good chunk of
that by selling its equity interests in some highly leveraged
companies. Those interests were valued at $230 million at
March 31, but investment bankers say their value may be as
little as $100 million because they are such illiquid
investments. In any event, Columbia will still need cash from
outside investors; such an investment will probably wipe out
shareholders. Also, by selling the bonds, it is losing its
biggest single source of cash, and the interest that it will
be receiving on the financing barely covers billions of
dollars in high-cost brokered deposits that remain on its
books. Some analysts believe that will make it next to
impossible for Columbia to be very profitable anytime soon
and that a federal seizure remains a possibility.
   However, Mr. Harshfield indicated he thought regulators
would find it hard to turn down the proposed bond sale. He
says rating agencies have already indicated that terms of the
underlying note are sufficiently rigorous to warrant an
investment-grade rating. He said regulators were already
starting to review the transaction, and that a decision is
expected within 60 days.
   "I would be highly surprised if there was a better price
to be gotten from this portfolio," he added. "I am extremely
confident that this is a good package." He says Columbia is
already actively considering buyers for the rest of the
institution, adding, "I think there is still a possibility
that we can pull this thing out."
   If regulators prohibit the deal, the alternatives aren't
very appetizing. To sell the entire junk-bond portfolio
without non-recourse financing might require discounts that
would add $300 million or more to Columbia's losses,
virtually assuring its failure at a high cost to the
government. Columbia already has a negative net worth of $216
million, a deficit that is expected to grow to nearly $300
million because of expected losses for the second quarter
ended June 30.
   In Washington, D.C., a spokesman for the Office of Thrift
Supervision had no comment on the proposed sale but promised
an "expeditious" review of it. The agency is being advised by
General Electric's Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. brokerage subsidiary.
The spokesman said regulators didn't consider that a problem
because General Electric's interest in Gordon Investment is
fractional and indirect. "There's a Chinese Wall that they
assured us would be meticulously observed," he added.
   Gordon Investment itself is something of an unorthodox
choice to come to the rescue. It has never before invested in
junk bonds, much less a portfolio the size of Columbia's, and
until yesterday, the boldest deal it had ever pulled off was
probably an investment in Canada's phone company two years
ago.
   "Everybody has phoned" wanting to know what prompted the
company's apparent shift in strategy, says partner Thomas
I.A. Allen. "We hope when the dust settles over a number of
years, that people will know the answer to that question." He
says the Columbia bonds presented "attractive investment
values over the long term."
   Columbia and other thrifts are under the gun to sell their
junk bonds because of a provision in the thrift bailout law
last year. The thrift said there were eight final bidders for
its portfolio. They are believed to have included Loews
Corp., Broad Inc. and Bankers Trust Corp.

   Film: Harrison Ford, `Presumed Innocent'

   Part of the appeal of Scott Turow's best-selling novel,
"Presumed Innocent," was the challenging thicket of plot the
book presented to the hardy reader. Mr. Turow's teasing,
withholding narrator coyly opened up paths that drew his
audience deeper and deeper into a complex puzzle of
interlocking plots. Though the subject was murder, the book
was about political corruption, lust, infidelity, kinky
sexual proclivities and most other expressions of the moral
disintegration that inevitably surrounds icy blondes with
trim behinds in certain kinds of fiction.
   What gave Mr. Turow's work extra weight was the authentic
tone of weary cynicism he acquired in his years as a
real-life prosecutor. That knowledgeable voice was powerful
enough to lure even an unwilling reader through endless
twists and turns, right up to the final twist, the one that
felt a bit like a cheat.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The movie version of "Presumed Innocent" dutifully tries
to duplicate the maze of plot without strong visual
dramatization or benefit of the guiding narrative voice.
(It's no accident, though it's an indication of some major
failing, that the movie's most engaged moments come at the
beginning and the end, with the sound of the main character's
voice speaking to an empty jury box.)
   The film makers decided that the only way to condense the
mass of information was through endless exposition. So, in
scene after scene, characters talk and talk. They talk
sitting behind desks, they talk going up and down elevators,
they talk walking through hallways.
   All this conversation takes place in the darkness favored
by cinematographer Gordon Willis. Monotonous as it becomes,
the darkness does match the tone of the material and the
seriousness of purpose that director Alan Pakula obviously
has brought to the subject. Yet for all the discussion of
evil there is little dramatization of it, and so a hot
subject has been cooled down. Still, the facts themselves
contain enough interest to keep eyes on the screen, even
though with this movie there's far more to hear than to see.
   Harrison Ford plays Rusty Sabich, the chief assistant
district attorney put in charge of the murder investigation
of a colleague, a woman who specialized in prosecuting sex
offenders. Her own murder was both brutal and overtly sexual.
The timing was inopportune for her boss, an ambitious
district attorney in the middle of a hotly contested election
campaign. Raymond, the district attorney, wants the case
dispatched quickly, so he turns to his ace assistant, Rusty.
   Rusty, who is married and has a young son, tries to beg
off but can't because he can't tell the boss the real reason
for his reluctance: that he and Carolyn were lovers. His
worst fears are soon confirmed as the evidence starts
implicating him. Soon he becomes both pursuer and pursued.
There is great appeal in this particular turn, which sets
into motion a great many machinations, both internal and
external, as Rusty tries to solve his case, or to appear to
be solving his case.
   In the book, Rusty told the story. The disadvantage of
this device was that, in the end, much of the story felt
disingenuous; one discovered the narrator hadn't always been
on the up and up with the reader. The film makers have
"solved" the problem by altering the ending and by either
imposing or permitting their Rusty to appear almost
impenetrably stolid.
   Mr. Ford, who has shown himself capable of range beyond
Indiana Jones, looks constipated for most of the movie. In a
way that's exactly the problem, since his character is
required to hold so much in. The Rusty we see is a family
man, with a somewhat oppressively cute child and a pretty,
nervous wife, Barbara, who reminds him frequently that she
has set aside her own intellectual pursuits for her family.
As played by the lovely Bonnie Bedelia, Barbara seems
self-pitying, vulnerable and, eventually, demented. But even
Ms. Bedelia can't make her a whole person, because Mr. Turow
didn't write her that way to begin with.
   Indeed, women are never presumed to be innocent in either
the book or the movie. Carolyn, introduced entirely through
flashbacks, is repeatedly referred to as smart, but her
brains aren't what she is remembered for. It's her beauty,
her coldness, her manipulativeness, her ambition. There is an
unspoken idea that maybe Carolyn deserved to be murdered,
even brutally, even though she seems to have directed her
ambition and manipulativeness toward doing her job (hardly a
terrible thing when you think about it, using everything she
had to put away rapists and child abusers). The movie Carolyn
offers only a hint of what it was that made so many men so
obsessed with her. When Rusty first recalls her, the film
makers flash the image of Greta Scacchi, who plays her, on
the screen. This vision, cold and beautiful though it may be,
has the passion of a bulletin-board advertisement for suntan
lotion. Like Barbara, she is unknowable.
   The men are more varied and more numerous as they play out
the movie's sprawling huggermugger. Raul Julia does a bizarre
turn as Sandy Stern, Rusty's Argentine Jewish defense
attorney and the main character in Mr. Turow's current best
seller, "The Burden of Proof." He looks a bit like Raymond
Burr in his Perry Mason days. Brian Dennehy brings his usual
heft, both physical and dramatic to the part of Raymond, the
pragmatic district attorney whose loyalties lie only with the
game. "Presumed Innocent" will appeal most to those who like
to figure out the game, no matter how it's played.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: Harrison Ford may be best known as a
swashbuckling action hero in the "Star Wars" and "Indiana
Jones" movie series. Nothing wrong with what he does there,
but he reached deeper levels in "Witness," Peter Weir's
bittersweet romance of a cop who finds love among the Amish.
He's also fine in Roman Polanski's "Frantic," a flawed yet
engaging thriller.

   The Minority Majority Will Never Come
   ----
   By Stephan Thernstrom

<LP>
   Will the U.S. have a "minority majority" by the year 2050?
So Time magazine, among others, has said. And if it is true
that before long English-speaking whites will be outnumbered
by blacks, Asians and Hispanics, it follows that the ebbing
white majority must act now to improve the lot of the current
ethnic minorities. If whites uplift and empower the new
majority before it takes over, it will be nicer to whites
once it's in the driver's seat.
   To the historian, such talk has a familiar ring. At the
beginning of this century, a great many Americans of native
stock worried that they would be swamped by the massive waves
of European immigration breaking on our shores, and the even
more massive families they were creating. One worrier
calculated that after 200 years 1,000 Harvard men would have
left only 50 descendants, while 1,000 Romanian immigrants
would have produced 100,000. There goes the neighborhood.
These fears of "race suicide" lay behind the legislation to
cut off the flow of new immigrants that passed Congress by
overwhelming majorities in the 1920s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The theory of the emerging minority majority is simply the
old race suicide theory with a twist. The old fear-mongering
incited Americans to guard the gates more vigilantly, to keep
out the rabble. Now similar population projections are
trotted out as evidence of the need for bigger and better
social programs. Don't try to keep Genghis Khan out of the
country; just make sure his kids are enrolled in Head Start.
   If something can be done to integrate minorities into
American life more smoothly, it should surely be done. But
not on the basis of a theory built on sand. Demographers, it
must be recalled, have never been much good at prediction,
and competent ones these days do not profess to be. In the
1930s, population experts were unanimous in foreseeing a
sharply declining population in the U.S. and other industrial
societies. Not one predicted the postwar Baby Boom or the
resumption of mass immigration to these shores. Instead of
declining in the past half century, the American population
has almost doubled. Demographers project future populations
on the basis of currently observable patterns of fertility,
mortality and migration. The more remote the future, the
greater the possibility that these patterns will change, and
the more susceptible they are to being changed by public
policy.
   For example, the fertility rate for black women is
currently about 30% higher than that for white women, with an
average of 2.3 expected births per woman vs. 1.8 for whites.
This differential has been shrinking: It was 33% in the late
1950s and 37% as late as 1965. A 30% fertility differential
on the part of a small minority does not result in dramatic
changes in group size, particularly when the group also has
above-average mortality rates.
   As a result, the black share of the population has not
grown fast. It was 9.9% in 1920, 10.0% in 1950, 11.1% in 1970
and is expected to be a bit over 12% when the returns of the
1990 census are in. (Of course we know that the census-takers
are unable to provide a fully accurate count of blacks, but
there is no reason to believe that the undercount was less in
earlier enumerations. If anything, the undercount was
probably smaller in recent censuses, since the problem has
been recognized and efforts have made to overcome it.)
   The diminution of black-white fertility differentials
reflects the rising educational levels of blacks and the
growth of a black middle class. The diminution is likely to
continue if those trends continue. Even if they do not, at
their current growth rate blacks will remain a small fraction
of the population even a century hence.
   The Asian population of the U.S. has been growing at a
spectacular rate since the 1965 immigration reform purged the
law of the anti-Asian biases that had infected it since the
Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. The growth, however, has been
almost all attributable to immigration: The major Asian
groups in the U.S. -- Chinese, Japanese, Koreans and
Filipinos -- are not notably fecund. If the proportion of
Asians in the population did rise so precipitously as to
constitute a great "problem" in the eyes of most Americans,
therefore, the solution would be quite simple. The flow could
be cut back easily, by modifying the immigration law.
   The dramatic growth of the Hispanic population over the
past three decades has been the result both of heavy
immigration from Central and South America, Mexico and the
Caribbean, and of the generally high fertility of Hispanic
immigrants and their children. There is great diversity among
the various groups included under the Hispanic label,
however. Cubans, for example, have a lower fertility rate
than native American whites do, and many other Hispanic
groups do not have conspicuously large families.
   According to the 1980 Census, the most fecund Hispanic
groups -- Mexicans and Puerto Ricans -- had fertility rates
that exceeded those of whites by 39% and 35% respectively,
and those of blacks by 9% and 6%. A significant differential,
but hardly an earth-shaking one, far smaller than the gap
between the fertility of native-born Americans and many
European immigrants groups at the turn of the century.
   Anyway, Hispanics born in the U.S. have fewer children
than their immigrant parents, and their children have fewer
still. In 1980 the fertility rate of native-born Americans
whose parents were born in Mexico was 15% below that of
Mexican immigrants; for Puerto Ricans born on the mainland
the generational fertility drop was 37%. With rising levels
of education Hispanic distinctiveness diminishes further. The
fertility of second generation Mexican-American high school
graduates is only 6% above that of non-Hispanic whites with
equal schooling. For those with some college, the difference
is only 1%. Second generation Mexican-Americans with college
degrees have 7% fewer babies than non-Hispanic white women
with the same educational attainments.
   There are two glaring flaws in the minority-majority
theory. With assimilation, high fertility immigrant groups
adopt native reproductive patterns. Theorists of "race
suicide" assumed that once a Romanian, always a Romanian,
even unto the third and fourth generation. They were utterly
wrong, not least because with each passing generation a
growing proportion of the descendants of the immigrants
married people of different backgrounds. It continues to
happen. A good many second-generation Hispanics now marry
"Anglos," and an even higher fraction of their children do.
   The second fallacy is the assumption that immigration will
continue at its present levels and will be governed by the
same entry criteria that have produced the current mix of
groups. Since 1965 U.S. immigration law has given
overwhelming priority to "family unification"; nine out of 10
entrants now come in on that basis. This, in effect, strongly
discriminates against prospective entrants from countries
that have been behind the Iron Curtain for a generation, and
favors groups like Mexicans, who have an abundance of
relatives already on the scene. Giving less priority to
family considerations and more to the possession of skills in
short supply in the American economy would bring in fewer
Mexicans and more Czechs and East Germans. That may or not be
desirable. The point is that the system could easily be
changed if there were a will to do so.
   Not only could the composition of the current immigrant
stream be substantially modified. The size of the total flow
could be greatly reduced if Americans became convinced that
immigration was producing undesirable changes in their social
order. The legislation of the 1920s depressed levels of entry
from Eastern and Southern Europe far below what they would
have been had the door remained open. And there is good
evidence that even the fairly mild restraints introduced by
the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 substantially
cut down the flow of illegal entrants.
   If today's immigrants assimilate to American ways as
readily as their predecessors at the turn of the century --
as seems to be happening -- there won't be a minority
majority issue anyway. Whatever their origins, they will have
joined the American majority, which is determined not by
bloodlines but by commitment to the principles for which this
nation stands.

   Spain's Banco Espanol de Credito said it had set up a
special line of credit to finance the purchase of paintings,
sculptures and antiques.
   The credit line is the first of its kind in Spain and
reflects a growing interest in art as an investment, said
Fernando Falero, a Banesto manager. He said the credit line
was open-ended, but added that clients would be charged
interest of around 16%. Average bank-loan rates in Spain
stand at around 15%.
   "There's no limit to how much we'll lend, within reason,"
Mr. Falero said. "If a client wants to purchase a Goya, we're
certainly willing to help fund the acquisition."
   Mr. Falero said the fund would underwrite purchases of
both old masters' art and works created by new artists.
"We're primarily interested in paintings and sculpture," he
said.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN: WORLD'S LEADING INVESTOR
                                                                                                       

   Japan has overtaken the U.S. to become the world's biggest
spender on new factories and industrial equipment, according
to a new study by the Washington-based Council of
Competitiveness, a group of 150 academics, union officials
and corporate executives. Despite an economy less than half
the size of the U.S., Japan spent $36 billion more on capital
investment in 1989 than the U.S.: $549 billion vs. $513
billion. "This marks the first time that any country has
out-invested the United States in plant and equipment in
absolute terms since World War II," the study said.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ZEALAND IMMIGRANT FEE
                                                                                                       

   New Zealand plans a levy on immigrants to pay for a fund
to help them settle into the country, Immigration Minister
Annette King said. The money, to be charged when an
immigrant's application for permament residence is accepted,
would pay for help including English language classes. The
fee has yet to be set but will be imposed soon. Refugees and
people entering on humanitarian grounds or to reunite with
relatives will be exempt.
                                                                                                       

   PHILIPPINES WANTS DEBT RELIEF
                                                                                                       

   The Philippines will seek debt relief from foreign
creditors to help recover from last week's earthquake,
President Corazon Aquino's spokesman said. The announcement
came amid growing pressure from Congress to suspend payments
of the $26 billion foreign debt to free funds for
reconstruction. The preliminary estimate of the damage
totaled 15.97 billion pesos ($697.4 million). "There are
various forms (of debt relief) that may be set . . . ranging
from the suspension of debt service to outright condonation,"
the spokesman said.
                                                                                                       

   NEW SOVIET CURRENCY RULES
                                                                                                       

   Soviet citizens will be allowed to spend foreign currency
at home beginning Aug. 1 without telling the government where
they got the money, the news agency Tass reported. Deputy
Prime Minister Stepan Sitarian said individual Soviets had
$324 million in foreign currency that they had legally
acquired but were unable to spend in the Soviet Union, except
at special shops for foreigners. Tass said under the new
rules, a network of stores and trade houses would be set up,
and Soviets would be able to buy "imported and high-quality
domestic goods."
                                                                                                       

   BRITISH ROYALTY'S INCOME
                                                                                                       

   Britain's royal family has been put on a fixed income
until the year 2000. Queen Elizabeth II will receive 7.9
million ($14.34 million) a year when the new system starts
next Jan. 1. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told Parliament
the fixed salary would replace the annual review in the
spring budget. Among other royals receiving money from the
state, the queen's husband, Prince Philip, will get 360,000 a
year, and the queen's sister, Princess Margaret, will get
220,000. The Prince of Wales, heir to the throne, doesn't
figure on the list because he draws his income from his
personal estate, the Duchy of Cornwall.
                                                                                                       

   EC'S WORKING-HOUR PROPOSAL
                                                                                                       

   Working-hour rules proposed yesterday by the European
Community Commission could drive up costs in many businesses,
industry officials said.
   Because of the restrictions proposed on night-time work,
the proposals would hit small enterprises particularly hard,
critics said. For example, French and Italian consumers might
have to pay more for freshly baked bread, or British
households might have to pay a higher price for the milk they
have delivered at their doorstep every morning.
   Among other things, the proposed working-hour rules would
ensure that workers get a minimum of 11 hours of continuous
rest per 24 hours.
   Both the EC employers' federation Unice and the British
government reiterated their opposition to labor legislation
at the EC level. "It is not necessary and it really doesn't
help" bargaining between labor and industry, a Unice official
said.

   Israel's Transport Ministry ordered the suspension of
flights by El Al airlines to Stockholm, saying new
airport-security measures there were inadequate. Both
ministry and El Al officials declined to comment on the
changes made at Stockholm's Arlanda airport. . . . An
epidemic of meningitis has killed at least 92 people during
the past month in the arid Karamonja region of northeastern
Uganda, a Kampala newspaper reported. The region is also
experiencing a severe drought.

   Thatcherism Is Beacon
   For Republic's Finance Chief

   MOSCOW -- When Margaret Thatcher began her crusade to
deregulate Britain's economy a decade ago, Boris Fyodorov was
watching. As a young graduate at the Soviet state bank, part
of his job was to monitor Mrs. Thatcher's moves, from the
privatization of state industry to the abolition of foreign
exchange controls.
   "It was a good school. I learned a lot," Mr. Fyodorov
says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now he has the opportunity to put those lessons into
practice. Last month, at the tender age of 32, he was picked
by Boris Yeltsin to be finance minister of the Russian
Republic and charged with revamping its vast but moribund
economy. He hasn't worked out detailed plans, but one thing
is already clear: the free-market philosophy of Thatcherism
will be a guiding force.
   "I want to create an infrastructure that will enable any
three people to get together and start a corporation," he
says. "The spirit of enterprise should be as free as
possible."
   Among other ideas, he wants to turn Russia into a nation
of budding stock owners and private entrepreneurs, legalize
the black market in foreign exchange and introduce a new
concept into Soviet economics: strict monetary and fiscal
discipline. And, of course, he says, "We can and will use
lots of elements from the British economy."
   If this sounds like wishful thinking, it probably isn't.
Mr. Fyodorov, an intense and pudgy man with thick spectacles,
is one of the most powerful and savvy members of a new
generation coming to the fore in the Soviet Union.
   Unlike the much older men who have made policy under
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev over the past five years,
these newcomers are scathing about the failings of
perestroika and unfettered by socialist ideology. They preach
the virtues of private property and free markets. Some of
them, notably Gavriil Popov, the mayor of Moscow, and Anatoly
Sobchak, the mayor of Leningrad, have even shown their
disdain for the establishment by leaving the Communist Party.
And whether Moscow likes it or not, they have increasing
clout.
   Newly elected regional and republican governments have
been piling the pressure on Moscow for greater autonomy and
an end to the centralized Soviet political and economic
structure. The election in May of the maverick Mr. Yeltsin as
president of Russia, the Soviet Union's most important
republic, has lent enormous weight to their efforts.
   Mr. Gorbachev has now started looking for ways to change
the system. But he is moving slowly, faced with the difficult
challenge of creating a new-style, looser Soviet federation
without causing the total breakup of the nation. The trouble
is, even the nimble Soviet leader is in danger of being left
behind.
   In the past few weeks, the governments of Russia,
Moldavia, Uzbekistan and the Ukraine, following the lead of
the three Baltic republics, have declared their
"sovereignty," ruling that local laws take precedence over
Soviet ones. Disputes are already breaking out between
central authorities and republican governments over who
should control what. And Mr. Fyodorov, the new Russian
finance minister, is in the thick of one of the most
important: "the war of the banks," as even the usually staid
Pravda has dubbed it.
   On July 13, the Russian Republic's Parliament, accusing
central authorities of financial mismanagement, declared that
it was seizing control of all banking and monetary affairs on
its territory. The state bank, which has had monopoly control
of Soviet finances since the days of Lenin, immediately
struck back. The following Monday, it instructed all banks in
Russia to ignore the Parliament's decision, and issued a
chorus of warnings about coming financial anarchy.
   "Like it or not, we must ensure that every republic
delegates its rights in the area of regulating monetary
affairs to the state bank of the U.S.S.R.," declared Viktor
Gerashchenko, the bank's chairman.
   Behind the angry reaction was a very real concern that
each republic would go its own way, issuing its separate
currency and tearing apart the financial unity of the Soviet
economy. The Baltic republics of Latvia, Estonia and
Lithuania, in particular, are already planning to issue their
own currencies. But the bank's stance flies in the face of
what even Mr. Gorbachev concedes should be the guiding
principle of the new federation: that elected governments in
the republics, not Moscow bureaucrats, should have first say
in policy.
   This week a truce was declared in the banking war, and Mr.
Fyodorov was instrumental in bringing it about. Meeting on
Monday with Mr. Gorbachev and senior government officials, he
insisted that Russia wasn't looking for a fight. The state
bank itself had created the confrontation by proposing to
revamp the entire national banking system without first
consulting the republics, he complained. And he suggested
redesigning the structure of central banking to give
republics a high degree of autonomy while preserving monetary
unity.
   Mr. Gorbachev seemed pacified. "We found common ground,"
Mr. Fyodorov says. "Confrontation is useless at this stage.
It will just hamper the reform process."
   But that doesn't mean Russia is about to give up its
combative stance. On the contrary. Although Mr. Fyodorov
hasn't worked out exact details, he advocates that all 15
Soviet constituent republics should have their own central
banks. Its representatives would meet to coordinate policy on
such national matters as the level of bank reserves, money
supply and interest rates. That way, the bureaucrats who now
run the state bank would be more or less out of a job. And
inevitably, the republic that is by far the biggest and
richest -- Russia -- would then call the shots on Soviet
monetary policy.
   "We need to move ahead, and if we switch then all others
will be obliged to do it," Mr. Fyodorov says. "It will be
like East and West Germany. . . . Russia could serve as West
Germany in the Soviet Union. If we are moving ahead
professionally, other republics, if they want to remain in
the union, would have to change their views." As to the
bureaucrats in central government, he says, "they should
understand that the declaration of sovereignty was no joke."
   With a population of almost 150 million people and blessed
with 90% of Soviet oil, 70% of its gas and most of its gold
and mineral reserves, the Russian Republic is clearly a force
to be reckoned with. But revitalizing such a potential
economic giant after decades of mismanagement won't be easy.
   Mr. Fyodorov is scathing about central authorities who
have tried to solve every problem by throwing money at it,
devaluing the ruble in the process to such an extent that it
is all but worthless. He sees one of his main tasks as
turning the ruble back into real money, through tight fiscal
and monetary policies.
   As he moves to devise new economic policies, he won't be
alone. Under Mr. Yeltsin's direction, several leading
economists are drafting economic reform programs that are
likely to be far more radically free-market than anything the
central government is working on. One of them, a plan for Mr.
Yeltsin's first 500 days, is already nearing completion. It
advocates sweeping denationalization of state property
followed by measures to lift rigid price controls.
   Mr. Fyodorov is wary of big-scale measures that are hard
to implement and end up as empty slogans. He favors smaller,
practical steps to encourage entrepreneurship and start the
process of deregulating the economy. That would involve the
Russian government using credit, tax and interest-rate
policies to establish a basic framework in which private
investment, both domestic and foreign, could thrive.
Companies could produce whatever was profitable, pay their
workers as they wish and do business with one another.
   "The idea is to start the stone rolling. Now, it's very
old and heavy and standing still," he says. As the economy
starts to move, the policies could then be refined. Thus, "We
could set up stock exchanges, but they don't need to have the
same complexity as the New York Stock Exchange at first. But
probably in a year, we will have to fight insider trading,
too."

   SEOUL, South Korea -- As the Cold War thaws, the question
no longer is whether the Soviet Union and South Korea will
establish diplomatic relations, but when.
   The biggest question may turn out to be where to put the
Soviet Embassy. The Russians had an embassy in Seoul about a
century ago, but closed it in 1904 after Russia lost a war to
Japan and Japan took over Korea. Numerous Korean newspapers
have been wondering whether the Russians will get back the
land, currently designated as Korean National Treasure 253.

   It was a perfect location then -- spacious, right next to
the king's palace -- to which it was connected by secret
tunnels -- with a hilltop view of events inside.
   Now valued at between $50 million and $60 million, the
site would be a perfect place -- still centrally situated,
but now overlooking the U.S. ambassador's residence and the
future U.S. Embassy site. "It had a heck of a view of the
palace," says Peter Bartholomew, a U.S. businessman and
amateur local historian. "It still has a good view."
   Cold War thaw or not, U.S. diplomats in Seoul say
privately they would object if the South Koreans even
considered giving the property back. Says one official, as he
looks into the ambassador's back yard from the site, "We
wouldn't want another Mount Alto on our hands," referring to
the hilltop in Washington where a Soviet Embassy building
enjoys an excellent vantage point for pulling in U.S.
government communications.
   The Americans say they haven't said anything officially
about the issue to either party. At the Soviet trade office
in Seoul's World Trade Center, representatives refer callers
to the South Korean Foreign Ministry. And while that ministry
won't say whether any inquiries have been made by the
Soviets, an official says emphatically, "They are not
entitled to the property."
   Ministry officials claim the Russians have lost their
claim to the land, originally deeded to the czar. The
property, now shared by office buildings and a park, is a
historical site; in 1896, when China, Britain, Russia, Japan
and the U.S. squabbled over control of Korea, King Kojong
fled to the Russian Embassy for protection.
   Anywhere else the embassy goes is likely to cause a
problem. There was a flap in the local press early last year
after the Hungarians, then still under the thumb of the
Soviets, put their new embassy into a skyscraper overlooking
the U.S. Army base in central Seoul.

   NEW YORK -- A successful cost-cutting program enabled Avon
Products Inc. to report a 20% gain in second-quarter earnings
on a revenue improvement of only 2%.
   Avon, a door-to-door seller of gifts, cosmetics and
accessories, earned $47.5 million, or 68 cents a share,
compared with $39.5 million, or 56 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales were $793.3 million, compared with $777.7
million. Excluding 1989 revenue from the Parfums Stern
division, which Avon sold in January, sales increased 6%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although its U.S. revenue was up only 2%, domestic pretax
operating earnings increased 29%. Avon also said revenue
increased 10% in its international division, which includes
Europe, Latin America, Canada and the Pacific, but operating
profit was down 5%. The company said the division's pretax
earnings last year were inflated by a tax refund in Britain.
Excluding the 1989 refund, it said, Avon International pretax
earnings rose 5%.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Avon shares closed at $36.875, up 37.5 cents.
   James Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive
officer, said he expects U.S. revenue will show gains for the
rest of the year. U.S. sales softened in the second half of
1989.
   "Avon's business is gaining momentum," said Andrew Shore,
an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "They've
succeeded in lowering their cost structure. It's fair to say
that the company is doing better than it has in some time."
   Mr. Shore said that one of Avon's key challenges involves
increasing U.S. revenue. "You only have so many rabbits to
pull out of the hat," he said, referring to Avon's
cost-cutting program. "At some point they will have to prove
they can grow their business here."
   The cost-cutting was evident in Avon's income statement.
Interest expenses dropped in the quarter to $24.1 million
from $28 million, reflecting a cut in Avon's debt to $645
million as of June 30 from $1.09 billion at the end of the
1989 second quarter. Marketing, distribution and
administrative expenses were reduced to $379.9 million from
$398 million.
   "We like the stock because we expect to see further
cost-cutting and debt reduction," said Diana Temple, an
analyst with Salomon Brothers. "We're estimating that the
company will earn $2.65 {a share} this year and $3.15 next
year."
   Robert Renck Jr., managing partner of R.L. Renck &amp; Co., a
brokerage firm that owns Avon stock for its money-management
clients, also expressed confidence despite the current gloomy
outlook for most retailers.
   "Avon is basically selling low-priced products which
people can afford even during a recession," he said. "People
can afford them. The economy isn't a major worry for me."
   In the six months, Avon's net income rose 37% to $62.7
million, or 79 cents a share, from $45.7 million, or 51 cents
a share. Sales climbed 1% to $1.5 billion from $1.48 billion.

   Armco Steel to Spend
   At Least $1.5 Billion
   To Improve Facilities

   MIDDLETOWN, Ohio -- Armco Steel Co. is likely to spend at
least $1.5 billion to improve its steelmaking facilities over
the next five years, according to its owners.
   Armco Steel is a joint venture between Armco Inc.,
Parsippany, N.J., and Kawasaki Steel Corp., Tokyo. It
operates steel mills here and in Ashland, Ky.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When the joint venture was established in 1989, the
companies said they planned to invest $1.1 billion over the
1989-94 period. About $200 million was invested in 1989.
   A new capital spending program will be considered by Armco
Steel directors next month, which will add some improvement
projects to the original plan, probably extending it into
1995. Armco Inc. and Kawasaki declined to provide specifics
on the additional projects.
   Kawasaki purchased a 40% interest in Armco's Eastern Steel
division last year to establish the joint venture. During the
1990 second quarter, Kawasaki contributed $70 million to
Armco Steel, raising its ownership to 45%. Kawasaki will
contribute another $70 million in 1991 and $35 million in
1992, at which time Armco Steel will be a 50-50 joint venture
between the parents.
   Kawasaki's payments will provide $175 million toward the
capital program. The remainder will come from cash flow and
borrowings, Armco said.
   The spending will include an overhaul of the rolling mills
to improve steel quality. A Kawasaki spokesman said the mills
currently can't meet the exacting specifications of Japanese
auto makers. One goal of the investment is to increase sales
to the U.S. auto plants owned by Japanese auto makers, he
indicated.

   Durables Orders
   Fell 3.2% in June
   After 4.2% Gain

   Last Month's Data Show
   Continuing Weakness
   In Manufacturing Sector

   WASHINGTON -- New government statistics show lingering
weakness in the manufacturing sector.
   Orders to factories for durable goods dropped 3.2% in June
after a 4.2% rise in May, the Commerce Department reported.
Nearly every category of the big-ticket items suffered
declines: transportation equipment, primary metals, machinery
and military equipment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at
least three years, such as cars, home appliances and
industrial machinery -- often fluctuate, but this year they
seem to have taken wider swings than usual, moving up
substantially one month and down the next.
   Their latest reversal suggests that U.S. manufacturing,
which appeared to have been scrambling out of the doldrums a
bit this spring, still has very little spark, a number of
economists said.
   "I think these numbers say the improvement has gone as far
as it can go," said Robert McGee, an economist at Tokai Bank
in New York.
   Manufacturing has been hurt by the Federal Reserve's
efforts to fight inflation over the past few years by holding
interest rates high. That has increased the cost of financing
major purchases and consequently has slowed demand.
   Almost two weeks ago the Fed nudged down a key interest
rate for the first time in six months, but Chairman Alan
Greenspan has stressed that the action was only an effort to
"offset" banks' tight lending policy. He has indicated that
no further moves are planned.
   That could leave the manufacturing sector flailing for a
while, economists said.
   Before there are substantial improvements in
manufacturing, Mr. McGee said, "I think it's basically going
to take some reason for consumer spending to pick up. . . .
And I just don't see where that is on the horizon."
   Some economists were also disturbed by a 0.5% drop in the
backlog of orders. "That doesn't augur too well for industry
going forward," said Peter Radford, chief economist at
National Westminster Bancorp in New York. "If backlogs start
to get worked off, that points to slower activity as we go
into the fall, and that's not so encouraging."
   Last month's decline brought new orders to $124.69 billion
in June. For the first six months of the year, new orders
came to $744.7 billion, 1.5% below a year earlier.
   A 20.7% plunge in orders for defense capital goods
accounted for much of June's drop. But even excluding
military equipment, orders would have been down 1.7%, the
department said.
   Analysts said they don't believe the slide in defense
orders reflects cutbacks in military spending but rather the
timing of government contracts.
   "I think it would be a little too early to see movements
of that kind from cutbacks in defense spending," Mr. Radford
said.
   Orders for transportation equipment fell 4.8%, largely
because of a decline in aircraft bookings. The only major
category to post a rise in orders was capital goods outside
the defense sector, an important indicator of business's
investment plans. But the 0.3% rise wasn't enough to offset
declines in April and May.
   All the figures were adjusted for normal seasonal
fluctuations but not for inflation.

   If you don't know who really wants the farm bill the House
is debating this week, economists at Purdue University have
some answers from a survey of farmers in 21 states. Those
with gross incomes of over $100,000 a year were most likely
to support government farm programs. Nearly half of small
farmers, for whom farm programs ostensibly are designed, want
a gradual elimination of subsidies.

   Tokyo stocks on the first section ended essentially flat,
with most early incentives drying up in the afternoon.
   London shares finished marginally higher as investors were
circumspect about the outlook for U.K. corporate earnings,
Wall Street, interest rates and the timetable for sterling to
enter the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System.

<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues edged down 1.19 points
to 31701.27. In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei
index rose 86.84 points to 31788.11.
   Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
350 million shares, down slightly from 355.5 million shares
Tuesday. Advancers outpaced decliners 541 to 388, while 194
issues were unchanged.
   As a result, the broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index of
all issues listed in the first section reflected a somewhat
firmer tone than the benchmark indicator. The Topix rose 2.72
points, or 0.12%, to 2307.31.
   Investor interest was clearly on the second section, where
buying on high-priced shares of value rebounded from recent
softness.
   The second section index gained 51.53 points, or 1.19%, to
4380.76. The section's volume was estimated at 21.2 million
shares, up from 15.6 million shares.
   "The second section had a fantastic day," one U.K. broker
said. "The high-priced second section shares are where
investors are seeing value short term," he added.
   As investors have been increasingly selective about
companies, he noted, action will likely continue to be drawn
to the second section.
   Trading on the first section in the morning was active,
though movement on the indexes was limited.
   The broad market firmed more than 100 points at the
opening as investors welcomed the New York market's recovery
overnight, which was driven mostly by buying on oil stocks.
   Linked to increased political tension in the Persian Gulf
and anxiety amid this week's meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, higher oil prices have also
encouraged buying of Tokyo oil shares, traders said.
   By the midmorning, overall stock prices were softer, as
investors who weren't able to unload positions over the
previous three days of losses on the Nikkei Index sold down
some high-priced shares, erasing early gains.
   Also midmorning, the yen began to weaken further against
the dollar. But although the currency's softening often
ignites some buying on export-oriented shares, too much
uncertainty about the direction of interest rates left
investors reluctant to purchase, traders said.
   Participants yielded to wait-and-see sentiments by
afternoon, during which the Nikkei Index drifted with little
direction.
   In the afternoon session, some professional buying gave
support to speculative and high-technology shares, though
traders said the atmosphere remained timid.
   Traders also said that volume will likely be slow today,
ahead of the first day of trading for accounts for August
settlement. General selling is expected to be thin during the
transition period, although the Big Four Japanese brokerage
firms are expected to be active, one Japanese trader said.
   Sony rose 210 yen to 8930 yen ($1.41 to $60.07), TDK
gained 120 yen to 7290 yen, Fanuc advanced 180 yen to 7390
yen, and Kyocera added 180 yen to 9040 yen.
   Also higher were CSK, up 180 yen to 6290 yen, and Hirose
Electric, up 180 yen to 7310 yen.
   Speculators' darling Jujo Paper rose 24 yen to 945 yen,
while Sanrio gained 120 yen to 8450 yen.
   But a broad range of shares were lower, including steel,
real estate and some financial issues.
   Kawasaki Steel fell 20 yen to 525 yen, Kobe Steel fell 18
yen to 520 yen, and NKK dropped 13 yen to 542 yen.
   London's day began on a positive note, with the
broad-based index charging to intraday peaks. But the advance
couldn't be sustained, analysts said, on the perception that
more corporate downgradings are likely to be in the pipeline.
   Moreover, dealers said investors were agitated by
sterling's slump, which came after Chancellor of the
Exchequer John Major failed Tuesday to mention plans for the
pound's entry into the exchange-rate mechanism in an economic
debate in the House of Commons.
   "The market is realizing that {ERM membership} will take
longer than anticipated," one market maker said. "Some of the
euphoria is evaporating."
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index was up
3.8 points at 2364.7. The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell
1 point to 1865.7. Volume was 427.5 million issues compared
with 385.7 million shares Tuesday.
   Reuters continued to attract attention after collapsing
184 pence ($3.34) Tuesday. Market watchers said they were
awaiting news from an analysts' meeting in the U.S., where
47.9% of the shares are held. "The jury's still out on
Reuters for the short term," one trader said. The stock
gained 18 pence to #10.63 on volume of 5.8 million shares.
   Elsewhere, oil stocks "held the market together," one
trader said, as the sector gained ahead of the start of the
full ministerial OPEC meeting. News that Iraqi troops were
massing at the Kuwait border also gave the sector a fillip,
as did a sharp gain in August Brent crude prices.
   British Petroleum rose 3 pence to 343 pence, Enterprise
increased 11 pence to 687 pence, and Shell Transport &amp;
Trading lost a pence to 488 pence.
   Another oil stock, Lasmo, fell 3 pence to 445 pence after
the company failed to beat market forecasts with an interim
pretax profit increase of 22%.
   Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Paris, Brussels,
Madrid, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Zurich. Shares ended lower
in Milan, and mixed in Frankfurt. South African gold stocks
closed higher.
   Stocks also ended higher in Hong Kong, Sydney, Singapore,
Taipei and Seoul, mixed in Manila, and lower in Wellington.

   New `Rules' Encourage Court Nominees
   To Speak Softly and Carry a Clean Slate

SUPREME COURT (SUP)

<LP>
   It was easy to become a Supreme Court justice in Oliver
Wendell Holmes's day.
   All you had to do was teach at a leading law school, write
compelling treatises, draft scholarly legal opinions and coin
such memorable phrases as "The life of the law has not been
logic; it has been experience."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Forget Justice Holmes -- he wouldn't even make the short
list today.
   For every lawyer dreaming of a seat on the U.S. Supreme
Court, the rules have changed. The nomination of David
Souter, possibly the lowest-profile nominee in history,
should send thousands of lawyers in search of Wite-Out to
remove entries from their resumes.
   The new canon of how to be appointed to the Supreme Court
includes such directives as:
                                                                                                       

   -- DON'T write law review articles on important legal
issues of the day.
   -- DON'T teach at a law school, where one's ideas are
challenged -- and remembered -- by students and faculty.
   -- DON'T speak on the lecture circuit.
   -- DON'T serve long enough on a federal court to establish
a judicial record that can be scrutinized.
   -- DON'T do or say anything unconventional.
   Judge Souter, who satisfied all the mandatory don'ts -- as
well as winning extra credit for not writing for the law
review while in law school or clerking for an appellate judge
after graduation -- is the ultimate tabula rasa.
   He served on the federal appeals court in Boston for such
a short time that he wrote no opinions, and cases he handled
while on the New Hampshire Supreme Court didn't usually
involve him in constitutional controversies.
   Judge Souter is widely described as a scholar, a label
that seems surprising, says New York lawyer David Boies,
because "ordinarily you think of a scholar as someone engaged
in research and writing and scholarship. The one thing you do
know is that he is not engaged in the activities of a
scholar."
   It's easy to see why such proven judicial scholars as
Frank Easterbrook and Richard Posner of the federal appeals
court in Chicago, Amalya Kearse and Ralph Winter Jr. of the
federal appeals court in New York, or Patrick Higginbotham
and Edith Jones of the federal appeals court in New Orleans
didn't make the cut. They didn't follow the revised "rules."
   Those rules are prompting confusion and alarm among the
legal elite.
   Bruce Fein, the conservative legal pundit who recently
predicted confidently that Solicitor General Kenneth Starr
(an inveterate revised-rule breaker with a long record as an
appellate judge and Justice Department official) would get
the nomination, can't say enough bad things about the present
situation.
   "I can't think of any outstanding justices who have come
to the Supreme Court as such a non-entity as Mr. Souter,"
says Mr. Fein.
   Mr. Fein says the new litmus test for appointees appears
to be, "Have you written anything that's challenged the
conventional wisdom? Have you performed as an advocate or a
judge on any important issue? Is your manner of speaking
sharp and pointed, as opposed to phlegmatic?" The correct
answer to all questions is "no."
   Court-watchers say the revised "rules" are, in part, the
product of a still-massive hangover from the divisive battle
in which outspoken conservative nominee Robert Bork failed to
win Senate confirmation in 1987. A rules revision seemed even
more urgent when Judge Douglas Ginsburg withdrew from
consideration after word of his past marijuana use put his
confirmation in jeopardy.
   But legal scholars say the list of don'ts also reflects
the cautious character of President Bush, the close split
between conservatives and liberals on the Court and the
dominance of abortion as a political issue. In addition, with
a Democratic Senate and a Republican White House, key
judicial nominations are likely to be hard fought.
   Judge Souter, a conservative in temperament and judicial
philosophy, without a trace of a record on his views on the
constitutionality of abortion, isn't likely to ruffle
feathers during confirmation hearings. That's particularly
important as this is an election year.
   "The last thing you want in a Supreme Court nominee is a
record," says Alan Morrison, a prominent public-interest
lawyer in Washington. "The Senate can't beat you with
nothing."
   Of course, not all Supreme Court nominees through the
years have had the prior career achievements of Justices
Felix Frankfurter, Louis Brandeis and Holmes. And even some
justices who later became well respected, such as William J.
Brennan Jr., the man Judge Souter is being nominated to
succeed, were little known at confirmation time and didn't
begin with overwhelming credentials.
   For his part, Judge Souter is a Harvard Law School
graduate and former Rhodes Scholar, and he is lauded by New
Hampshire lawyers for his keen legal mind and his quickness
in oral arguments. State bar president John T. Broderick
says, "If you get an opportunity to spend 10 minutes talking
to him about the law, you are in the presence of someone very
special. And if you argue before him, you find he has a
compelling mind."
   Nonetheless, unlike most previous court nominees, Judge
Souter seems never to have expressed himself on any important
legal or philosophical matter -- in any forum. While Sandra
Day O'Connor was a state appeals judge before her nomination
and had never sat on a federal bench, she had articulated her
views on issues as an Arizona state legislator. Anthony
Kennedy, the most recent appointee, wasn't a household name
in legal circles before his nomination, but he had served for
12 years on the federal appeals court in San Francisco and
had taught constitutional law for more than two decades.
   The big question now is whether the new set of rules will
remain in effect when Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry
Blackmun -- both in their 80s -- and perhaps others leave the
court in coming years.
   Lawyers say that if President Bush wins re-election, he
might be more willing to go out on a limb with a judicial
candidate who has ideas, if not skeletons, in his closet.
Judge Souter "certainly looks like a situational appointment
-- defensive in large respect," says Harvard Law School
professor Charles Nesson. "I don't know if that speaks to a
long-term trend. It's a situation that arises before an
election. I suspect things would be different in his second
term."
   For as long as the revised rules remain in effect,
however, lawyers and judges with more obvious credentials are
likely to bemoan the current selection process.
   "There's no doubt in my mind that a lot of hopes were
dashed this week," says Harvard Law School professor Arthur
Miller, "and if it's a signal that being a standout jurist
with a visible record is a liability, that is a very sad
signal."

   British Schools Declare Independence

   LONDON -- Some British municipal governments have become
strangely hostile toward local schools. In the London borough
of Sutton, local authorities lobbied to get the budget of
Wilson's School reduced by $126,000. In Manchester, the Labor
councils of Bolton and Tameside each imposed sanctions on a
local school. They ordered government agencies not to sell
cleaning, meal and maintenance services to the schools. Other
schools have suddenly found themselves banned from municipal
swimming pools.
   What goes on here?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The schools have become the target of these hostilities
because they have declared independence from their local
education bureaucracy. They are furthest along in a broad
movement toward parental choice in education, and maximum
local control.
   In the U.S., this movement takes the form of vouchers or
choice plans, such as the kind being fought over in
Milwaukee. But in the U.S. politicians have supported choice
mostly with words. In Britain, Margaret Thatcher has
initiated the crucial reform, with results for all to see.
   In Britain, parents can now choose which school they wish
their child to attend, and schools can break away from the
regional education bureaucracy. If the majority of parents at
a school vote to "opt out," their school becomes independent.
Decisions on everything from hiring teachers to building
science labs are then made by the headmaster and the school's
parent-dominated governing body, and no longer by the distant
bureaucracy. The schools are still state funded, but opt-out
schools get checks directly from the Department of Education
in London.
   The size of the check is determined by how much the
regional bureaucracies were spending per pupil under the old
system. But the regional bureaucracies spend as much as 30%
of their budgets on themselves. Now the money goes straight
to the schools, and the opt-out schools often find they have
an extra chunk of money to spend on faculty, books or
equipment.
   Forty-four schools have opted out since the choice became
available just over a year ago. The schools in Sutton, Bolton
and Tameside are among the vanguard, as is the London Oratory
School, in central London. Like many of the renegades, London
Oratory is known for rigorous standards and traditional
pedagogy. In the front hall, a uniformed pupil is being
reprimanded for having addressed a teacher while his hands
were in his pockets -- a sign of disrespect not tolerated.
   Headmaster John McIntosh wears the long black academic
robe that calls to mind "Goodbye Mr. Chips." He says that
opting out has had a tremendous impact on how he spends his
day, "I'm no longer called to meetings at the local education
authority where you sit around a table and talk about details
ad nauseam."
   Schools now deal with local contractors themselves:
"Whereas previously we had to put in an order for new
equipment and of course there was tremendous paperwork and
delay -- up to three years. Now we can pick up a telephone
and get it instantly," Mr. McIntosh says.
   Mr. McIntosh is not the only one who gets excited while
talking about the advantages of opting out. Student
applications to opt-out schools increased 40% this year.
Though England suffers from a teacher shortage, the schools
were able to fill all their job vacancies.
   Opt-outs have found themselves with, on average, between
15% and 20% more money to spend, and with more discretion to
channel the money as they wish. At the Hendon School in
London, for example, there has been a 58% increase in
expenditure on books and teaching materials, a 400% increase
on classroom equipment, a 25% increase in tuition for music
lessons and improvements in school meal provisions. Bankfield
High School in Cheshire hired six extra teachers and
increased per-pupil spending on books from $50 to $160.
   Other schools are simply glad to be free from the
political meddlings of the local council. In Derbyshire, in
the Midlands, the Labor council decided to replace the
Chesterfield School's 394-year-old crest with the motto,
"Derbyshire County Council supports nuclear-free zones,"
prompting exasperated parents to begin opt-out procedures.
   Opt-out reforms threaten to make local bureaucrats
obsolete, and opposition from those quarters has been
predictably vitriolic. Teacher unions continue to mobilized
against opt-outs, and the Labor Party, which depends on these
unions, has promised to eliminate opt-out schools if Neil
Kinnock is elected prime minister. In fact, many parents have
decided to postpone opt-out campaigns until after the next
election.
   Those that do wage opt-out efforts often find themselves
in the midst of tough and sometimes dirty political brawls.
Some municipal authorities have joined with the trade unions
to set up the "Local Government Information Unit" which urges
parents to vote no on opt-out proposals. The council that
controlled London Oratory took out advertisements in London
papers warning parents that if they voted to opt out, their
students would no longer have use of the administrative
paraphenalia the central office offered. Mr. McIntosh says
the ads did not do his side much harm, since "It was exactly
that paraphenalia we were trying to get away from."
   Elsewhere, tactics are rougher. In Tameside the local
council tried to sell the school grounds and buildings in an
effort to foil an opt-out plan (an independent school would
have to pay rent to the new private owners). In the London
borough of Brent, black parents were told that opted-out
schools would discriminate against them. Elsewhere parents
have complained to the Department of Education about
threatening visits to parents' homes before ballots, and
about threats against teachers who support opt-out efforts.
   Even after the opt-out decision has been made, some Labor
councils mount retaliation campaigns. After the parents at
the decaying Baverstock School in Birmingham voted to opt
out, the council ruled that Baverstock would not be allowed
to join a Vocational Education consortium. Baverstock
students may not be able to compete with other Birmingham
sports teams or use the city's field houses. But the school
has about $540,000 extra per year to spend on education. It
has hired six teachers, employed a full-time nurse and
caretaker, increased spending on books by 130%, spent $47,000
on computers, added a hot breakfast program and spent $70,000
on building repairs.
   Mrs. Thatcher is thinking about making the opt-out reform
a central issue in her re-election campaign. This week she
pressed her advantage by proposing to give schools authority
to deviate from the national teacher pay scales, to the howls
of the teacher unions. The Labor Party, meanwhile, is
pinioned to the inflexible unions. It is also stuck with a
radical egalitarian ideology: Confronted by diversity, it
sees only inequality and it cries "Stop]" Such a philosophy
makes sensible reform impossible.
   In many ways, the opt-out campaign resembles modernization
efforts in Eastern Europe. Rather than try to reform or
shrink stagnant bureaucracies, it is easier simply to bypass
them.

   Saddam Hussein surely knows how to spoil a party. The
Iraqi leader has been the annoying buzz at the gala
celebrating the end of the cold war. But Western political
leaders have preferred to ignore him, since they are having
such a good time.
   It's been more fun, in the mood of general revelry, to
withdraw military power, especially from the Mediterranean.
All summer, Congressional Democrats have been ridiculing a
Pentagon plan to build a base at Crotone, in southern Italy.
The base would enable NATO to project air power throughout
the Middle East. "Given the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, why
do we need another NATO air base?" asks Senator Jim Sasser.
Rep. Pat Schroeder, eager to save domestic bases, calls the
Crotone base "a waste of money."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday, the U.S. announced that it was closing two
Mediterranean bases in Greece, to consolidate forces on a
single base on Crete. Greek leftists rioted against any U.S.
military presence.
   On Monday, the usually sensible Rep. Les Aspin said he
would oppose future production of the B-2 Stealth bomber,
which can evade radar and hit terrorist or other targets. In
May, the Canadian defense minister announced that, owing to
global peace, NATO was cancelling plans for a fighter
training base where pilots from 11 nations would have learned
to fly low-altitude attack missions.
   But Saddam Hussein's annoying buzz is now so loud it
should be heard even above the din of Europhoria. U.S. forces
already have started exercises in the Persian Gulf. Maybe
it's time to put away the party hats and remember that
history hasn't ended.
   At first glance, Mr. Hussein's outrageous bullying of
Kuwait seems like lunatic belligerency. His thuggery diverts
attention from Israel, over whom the Arabs have been winning
propaganda victories of late. Moreover, it dashes Mr.
Hussein's chances of becoming the indisputed leader of the
Arab world. This episode has spooked a lot of Arab leaders
who were happy to cheer him on as he threatened to gas half
of Israel. Now moderate Egypt is acting like the keystone of
the Arab states.
   But there are kernels of rationality in his recent
behavior. Iraq's peace with Iran now looks like part of a
larger strategy. Some of the nearly 700,000 Iraqi soldiers on
the Iranian border now can be directed toward easier prey.
Iraq has twice as many soldiers as Kuwait has citizens. With
threats that it would "break necks," Iraq now is demanding
"massive reparations" for alleged Kuwaiti oil thefts (in
reality both sides seem to be stealing from each other). Iraq
also seeks forgiveness on the $10 billion debt it owes
Kuwait. Yesterday's diplomatic moves suggested that the
extortion was likely to work.
   This week's events also signal that the Iraqi dictator is
willing to serve as OPEC's enforcer. The fall in oil prices
has put restraints on the amount of money Mr. Hussein could
spend on his war machine. His government has said it would
like to see oil at $25 a barrel, and he clearly is willing to
intimidate Kuwait or the United Arab Emirates if they
continue to violate their quotas. Remember that Mr. Hussein
bombed the UAE oil rigs in 1986 because he thought the
country was not supporting him sufficiently in the war with
Iran.
   The Saudis, though frightened by Mr. Hussein's thuggery,
clearly appreciate Iraqi efforts to boost prices. We may yet
see the restoration of the Iran-Iraq-Saudi dominance of OPEC
that led to the ruinous price rises of the 1970s.
   For the past several years, while the West studiously has
been looking the other way, Iraq has built up a substantial
munitions industry and one of the world's largest armies. Mr.
Hussein builds his own ammunition, mortars, bombs and
missiles. Though his attempts to get a supergun were foiled,
he has no trouble buying other weaponry, often from Europe.
The U.S. State Department resists any attempt to impose even
economic sanctions on the country. The European diplomatic
posture has been to lay low. Kuwait gave more than $30
billion in military aid; obviously appeasement doesn't work.
   Mr. Hussein's violent rise has transformed the Middle East
problem. The major flashpoint is no longer the Syrian-Israeli
dispute. Now, the eye of the storm is in Baghdad, and it
radiates out in all directions, militarily and economically.
   Mr. Hussein personifies the type of military menace likely
to persist and grow even if the Soviet threat fades (itself
no safe assumption, given the Soviet Union's huge and
undiminished strategic arsenal). Aside from humanitarian
considerations, Western interests would be immediately
jeopardized by an invasion of Kuwait and a newly militant
OPEC. In today's exquisitely interdependent world, we need to
think again about the ancient military mission known as
suppression of piracy. Today's pirates come with chemical and
conceivably even nuclear weapons, and aren't likely to be
deterred by the mantra, "peace is breaking out all over."

   Japanese Visas
   Elude Students
   Who Fled China

   TOKYO -- Some Chinese students in Japan aren't being
granted visa extensions that would allow them to remain in
the country, despite fears they face retaliation in China for
their pro-democracy activities, students and Japanese
human-rights advocates say.
   Meeting with foreign reporters, three students and their
Japanese supporters said four leaders of a pro-democracy
group have been told by immigration authorities that they
must return to China in the next month. About 20 Chinese
students active in the group have been told their
applications would be taken under consideration. But none
have actually received extensions, the students and lawyers
said. Some have been kept for months in an uncertain legal
status, their visas having expired and their renewal
applications classified merely as "pending."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Japanese government, along with other developed
nations, "said it would protect students after Tiananmen,"
said Katsutoshi Fujimori, an attorney representing Chinese
students in Japan. "But it doesn't look like they plan to
really honor that promise." Chinese soldiers who cleared
pro-democracy protesters from Tiananmen Square in Beijing in
early June 1989 killed hundreds of students, workers and
others there and in other parts of the Chinese capital.
   Japanese officials say they are standing by a pledge, made
after last year's summit of industrial nations in France, to
give pro-democracy Chinese students favorable treatment
within the framework of Japanese immigration law. A section
chief in charge of residence issues in the Justice Ministry's
immigration agency said most extension applications are being
processed within three months. And he said applicants with
documentation of continued student status have received
extensions, though he couldn't say how many.
   More than 11,000 Chinese entered Japan in 1989 to study,
according to the immigration official. About 65 students last
year asked for visa extensions for political reasons, a
Foreign Ministry official said.
   Unlike the U.S. and some other countries, Japan hasn't
granted a general right for Chinese students to stay.
Instead, authorities here have insisted on treating Chinese
applicants' cases individually. The immigration official
wasn't available to comment on the cases of students at the
news conference.
   Japan has been criticized by humanrights advocates for its
inhospitality toward political refugees. Many Japanese fear
that open immigration could disrupt the country's social
harmony.

   Salomon Faces Issue of Conflict on RJR Warrants

   NEW YORK -- Diana Temple, the veteran tobacco analyst at
Salomon Brothers Inc., has been telling the world that RJR
Nabisco Inc.'s warrants look significantly undervalued at
today's prices.
   What Ms. Temple isn't publicizing is that Salomon is
almost certainly the biggest single holder of those RJR
warrants. In an obscure Securities and Exchange Commission
filing in mid-June, Salomon vice chairman Stanley Shopkorn
disclosed that Salomon owned 4.7 million of the warrants, or
10% of the total outstanding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That creates some awkward problems for Salomon, which
would like to be known both as a trading powerhouse and a
reliable source of impartial investment research.
   Ms. Temple says she is playing things strictly by the
book. "The rule around Salomon is: You talk first to the
customers; then you talk to {Salomon's own} trading desk,"
she says. As far back as last January or February, Ms. Temple
says, she began telling clients why she thought the tobacco
and food company's warrants might be a good buy.
   The trouble is, most of Salomon's customers weren't
listening. RJR's warrants, which give holders the right to
buy equity in closely held RJR, languished between $4 and $6
apiece during the winter and early spring, even though Ms.
Temple argued that they might be worth $8 to $13. (She
currently values them "conservatively" at $8 to $9.)
   Meanwhile this spring, Salomon's traders gobbled up any
warrants they could find. Salomon's main buyer, convertible
bond trader John Sandelman, won't talk about the firm's
holdings or whether Ms. Temple influenced his thinking. But
traders at other firms say they believe Mr. Sandelman began
buying last April, picking up a lot of warrants from the
Belzberg family of Canada. The Belzbergs won't comment.
   Traders say they believe Mr. Sandelman recently has plowed
even more of Salomon's cash into RJR's warrants.
   The warrants were unchanged yesterday at $6.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Assuming that Salomon did most of its buying at lower
prices, it has a modest paper profit already on its RJR
warrants.
   Now Ms. Temple is in a quandary. If she remains vocally
bullish on the RJR warrants, clients may regard her analysis
as merely an effort to talk up Salomon's big holdings. "To
me, the fact that Salomon has $30 million invested in RJR
warrants is much more eloquent than anything an analyst might
say," says one portfolio manager who has traded actively in
RJR securities.
   Things will get even stickier if Ms. Temple turns bearish,
or Mr. Sandelman decides to unload his warrants. "In general,
a Wall Street firm can't trade against its analysts'
recommendations," says a New York Stock Exchange spokeswoman.
So if Ms. Temple says "sell," Mr. Sandelman's buying binge
ought to come to an end. Or if Mr. Sandelman wants to cash
out, Ms. Temple presumably will have to cool her enthusiasm
for the RJR warrants.
   If Salomon had its way, few people would know about the
delicate maneuverings between its research and trading
departments. When the Wall Street firm made its SEC filing,
Salomon's Mr. Shopkorn added a note saying that Salomon
"expressly disclaims that it has a filing obligation with
respect to the warrants" because they aren't yet convertible
into RJR common stock.
   Still, Salomon's legal department said the filing should
be made in any case.
   Now regulators and Salomon clients can watch to see how
the trader-analyst minuet will unfold. "It's a very complex
area," says Larry Bergman, an associate director of the SEC.
"There aren't any bright lines about what firms can and can't
do."

   The Balloons Are

   Children's Crusade Is Battling
   Ceremonial Launchings
   As a Threat to Wildlife

   LANCASTER, N.H. -- Kids are saying the darndest things
about balloons.
   Suppose, they are saying, some grownups set free a batch
of balloons at a grand opening or something. And suppose one
of the balloons landed in the ocean.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "An animal could eat it mistaking it for a meal," Annie
White recently fretted, in an essay for her fourth-grade
class. The balloon "could block its stomach, so it could not
eat anymore. So it would die. Then it could be hit by a boat
repeller or get injured."
   Miss White isn't the only one who is concerned about
turning balloons loose in the environment. In Pennsylvania,
sixth-graders asked the state legislature to curb balloon
launches. So did eighth-graders in Southern California, who
flew to the state capital to lobby. And in Connecticut, the
children have clobbered the opposition.
   A bill in Connecticut's legislature to curb the launches
faced opposition and "wasn't going anywhere," says State Rep.
Mary Mushinsky of Wallingford. "Then the fourth-graders came
in all dressed up, with bow ties and dresses. They looked the
members in the eye, and each read two sentences" favoring the
bill. "That did it." Now Connecticut has a law banning all
open-air launches of 10 or more balloons.
   The balloon industry is fit to be tied. It says crafty
environmentalists lacking proof have spread false alarms to
whip up a children's crusade. Balloons are attacked mainly
because they're a target kids can't miss, this $1 billion
industry says. Environmentalists tend to agree that in terms
of threats to marine animals, latex balloons are much less of
a problem than plastics. And only balloon launches into the
air, not balloons as such, are the subject of criticism.
   An industry point man on the issue is Rick Tillotson, who
has deep roots in the balloon business. His father, Neil
Tillotson, is credited with inventing a latex balloon in
Watertown, Mass., in 1931. The younger Mr. Tillotson runs his
own firm in Dixville Notch, N.H., called Tilly Balloon Co.,
and when he gets wind of balloons being bashed, he doesn't
clown around. Mr. Tillotson charges that "evil" manipulation
of children's minds of the sort practiced by some
anti-balloon adults "would be a good way to bring on Nazism."
   Lately, balloons have been soaring. U.S. balloon sales
have doubled since the mid-1980s, and rose 34% last year
alone, says Debra Paulk, editor of a magazine called Balloons
Today. However, now some firms find their sales hurt by the
flap. "We've lost upwards of $60,000 of business in the last
year" because of it, says Philip Levin, president of Balloon
City USA Inc. in Harrisburg, Pa.
   Some vendors are rumbling ominously about suing two New
Jersey teachers they blame for starting the crusade. The
balloon people are financing studies they hope will prove
balloon launches benign. They have hired lobbyists to quash
kid-backed balloon bills.
   To protest the Pennsylvania bill, Mr. Levin took to
launching balloons daily next to the state capitol. However,
a foe came along and tried to pop them with a knife. The
balloon man blew up.
   "The guy {with the knife} was screaming, `The balloons are
killing animals,'" says Mr. Levin. "He broke three or four
before I could push him away. It was on TV, showing me
pushing him."
   What set all this off was the discovery, in July 1985, of
a sick sperm whale washed up on a New Jersey beach. It
eventually died when dashed against a pier, and Robert
Schoelkopf, founder of the nonprofit Marine Mammal Stranding
Center of Brigantine, N.J., did a post-mortem. Inside the
stomach he found a Mylar balloon. He concluded that the
silvery, heart-shaped plastic balloon -- which isn't the sort
used in launches -- had plugged the whale's digestive tract,
making it too weak to swim.
   Two years later, on a different New Jersey beach, a
leatherneck turtle turned up dead with a latex balloon inside
it. It was found by Peter and Susan Hibbard, who teach
high-school biology in Toms River, N.J., and are associated
with Mr. Schoelkopf's center. A few months later, the couple
formed the Balloon Alert Project.
   It has built a growing network of like-minded teachers and
students. And in recent months, balloon launches have been
canceled in several states. Under pressure from
environmentalists, Walt Disney World and Disneyland have
halted balloon releases. Ms. Hibbard makes clear that "we
aren't against balloons, only balloon releases."
   Nevertheless, says Dan Flynn, spokesman for Pioneer
Balloon Co. of Wichita, Kan., "Some children are getting the
idea that all balloons are bad. And when kids are brought
{into legislative hearings}, you don't have a chance."
   Here in Lancaster, 58 students have formed the Balloon
Launch Terminators, or BLTs. In May, the group stopped a
school balloon launch, then sent a letter to a local paper
urging others to do likewise.
   Two days later, Mr. Tillotson phoned. "He was after my
hide," says Andrea Craxton, a third-grade teacher who had
helped the BLTs get started. Soon, Mr. Tillotson marched into
the school (by invitation) armed with latex samples, a
scripted lecture and a pop quiz to set the record straight.
First question: "I understand that silver metallic and
ordinary rubber latex balloons are different. Yes or No."
   Then came a comic book featuring Lex Latex, a talking
balloon. "Balloon releases," Mr. Latex advised, "are safe and
beautiful."
   Few in the audience were won over. "I still do not think
balloon launches are very safe for animals," wrote Miss
White, who will be in the fifth grade this fall. "Because one
day my dog swallowed a piece. And she died."
   The BLTs concede some of the industry's points seem valid.
But, says fellow fifth-grader Erin Fogg: "It didn't make much
sense when he said our `little hearts would be broken' if we
couldn't have balloon releases. We can live without them."
   With the help of teachers, the BLTs are doing an in-depth
study of balloons before making another move. They have
learned there are few documented cases of balloons being
found inside animals, and no clear proof the animals died
from eating them. They are looking at an industry-sponsored
study indicating that released latex balloons typically rise
about five miles, then shatter into bits that decay fairly
rapidly. They have heard that when University of Miami
biologist Peter Lutz fed balloon shreds to sea turtles in
another industry-funded study, the pieces eventually came out
the other end.
   On the other hand, they have learned Mr. Lutz is concerned
because some balloon shreds got balled up inside the turtles
and took months to pass through them. From their own
experiments, the students have found that balloon bits can
take months to fully decay outdoors. They have heard that in
a 1989 national beach cleanup lasting only a few hours,
volunteers found 18,251 balloons.
   All this is a bit overwhelming, but it has "encouraged a
lot of questioning by the kids," says Ron Pelchat, one of the
BLTs' teachers. Elizabeth Riff, another teacher, says: "The
more we read, the more we're getting fired up."
   The BLTs aren't entirely sure what they're getting fired
up to do. But whatever it is, wrote Sarah Tetreault in her
fourth-grade essay, "I want to make the world a beautifuler
place."

   PINKHAM NOTCH, N.H. -- Nobody wanted to fight the Battle
of Flat Mountain Pond.
   For more than a century, Flat Mountain Pond was a
half-forgotten back-country trout pond known only to hardy
sport fishermen and devout hikers who ventured seven miles up
into the vistas of New Hampshire's White Mountains. But today
the pond is the focus of one of the most bitter environmental
struggles in the nation, a collision of interests that pits
conservationists who want to preserve the wilderness against
disabled people who want a whiff of it for themselves.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is a classic confrontation," says Kenneth Kimball,
director of research for the Appalachian Mountain Club, "but
a sad one."
   This week, as President Bush prepares to sign the
Americans with Disabilities Act to require increased access
and opportunities for the nation's disabled, a coalition of
environmental groups is pressing forward with its effort to
stop the U.S. Forest Service from "upgrading" the Flat
Mountain Pond Trail and installing as many as 13 rustic
bridges to permit vehicles to carry disabled people to the
edge of the federal Sandwich Range Wilderness.
   "This is an issue we hate," says Emily Bateson, senior
scientist for the Conservation Law Foundation of New England,
which is leading the effort to stop the trail upgrade. "But
we don't want to {put in} a road like this."
   The debate has prompted high emotions among the disabled
and among the legions of hikers who regard the White
Mountains as something of a sanctuary, splitting the
tranquility of a corner of New Hampshire that provided a
refuge for politicians like Daniel Webster, an inspiration
for writers like Nathaniel Hawthorne, and a brilliant
panorama for landscape artists like Thomas Cole.
   "I don't feel we're fighting people in wheelchairs," says
Michael Kellett, New England regional director of the
Wilderness Society. "We're fighting an ill-conceived plan
that won't benefit many people in wheelchairs."
   Republican state Rep. Raymond Conley, a paraplegic who
used a wheelchair for nearly four decades after being
disabled as a Navy pilot in the Korean War, responds: "Some
of these folks are trying to tell handicapped people where
they belong. They're saying there are other places that are
more appropriate for us. Who says so? People who can walk and
carry backpacks. There are a lot of well-meaning people who
are making decisions for the disabled."
   The battle has skewed the usual alliances, both here in
the notches of the North Country and in the offices of the
federal bureaucracy. The disabled are siding with the
government. Environmentalists are finding themselves in the
uncomfortable position of opposing the disabled at a time
when the disability-rights movement is flush with triumph in
Congress. A provision in the bill that Mr. Bush is expected
to sign today specifically permits the creation of access for
the disabled up to a wilderness boundary.
   "I'd rather vote against an environmentalist than a guy in
a wheelchair," says GOP Rep. James Hansen of Utah, a House
Interior Committee member who championed the
wilderness-boundary provision in the disability bill. "Most
of these environmentalists don't know one end of a pine tree
from another but they like the calendars they get."
   The trail that is causing all the controversy hugs the
boundary of the Sandwich Range Wilderness but doesn't pierce
it. The changes call for 13 bridges as long as 46 feet and
for treated decks 10 feet wide, with about 140 feet of wooden
raised deck near the end of the trail and a "small, primitive
parking lot away from and out of sight of the pond."
   The access plan would permit four vehicles a day of less
than 4,000 pounds to follow the path from Sandwich Notch Road
to the summit of Carrigan Outlook, up the top of a highlands
knob, over the east fork of a spring brook, beyond the
Wonalancet River and on up to Flat Mountain Pond.
   And though the trail won't be an upcountry version of the
Merritt Parkway or even a rustic Route 66, the specter of
automobiles plying the sylvan reaches of the Sandwich Range
troubles environmentalists, who complain about "disruption of
the wilderness character of the area through noise, road
development, ruts, fumes and other conflicts." The
Conservation Law Foundation's appeal argues that the upgrade
would harm the wilderness by introducing "the sounds, smells
and possibly sights of the internal-combustion engine --
which symbolizes the very antithesis of wilderness."
   Rep. Conley argues that the road is merely an improvement
of an existing railroad bed (like many parts of the White
Mountains, the area was heavily logged in the last century)
and that environmentalists want to keep the wilderness to
themselves. "The wilderness zealots don't want the
internal-combustion engine ruining their wilderness
experience," he says. "That's the sum and substance of their
whole argument."
   The coalition of environmental groups against the plan
include the Sierra Club, the Sandwich Range Conservation
Association and the Wonalancet Out Door Club; the Appalachian
Mountain Club, a major voice in the White Mountains, hasn't
taken a position. The opponents emphasize, however, that they
don't want to exclude the disabled from the White Mountains.
   "We want all sorts of handicapped access," says Ms.
Bateson of the Conservation Law Foundation. "But it has to be
done with sensitivity to the resource and the other users. We
can't carve up our wilderness in the name of the
handicapped."
   Advocates of the Flat Mountain Pond plan are contending
that the plan wouldn't substantially change the character of
the area. "The whole idea is to give the handicapped a
challenge, not to provide a paved path that a two-wheel-drive
car can go down," says Douglas Eoute, chief of the bureau of
trails in the New Hampshire Division of Parks.
   The Forest Service has a number of campgrounds around the
country to accommodate the disabled, and it has built several
short trails of about a hundred yards for wheelchairs. One
wheelchair path, the Sheepshead Trail of Deer Lodge National
Forest in Montana, is about a mile long. But no access path
for the disabled is as ambitious as that contemplated for
Flat Mountain Pond.
   Some disabled activists, however, would rather not have
such an ambitious project. "There's a knee-jerk reaction that
people with disabilities need to have motors to get access to
wilderness areas," says Gregory Lais, executive director of
Wilderness Inquiry, a Minneapolis-based adventure-travel
organization for the disabled. "There needn't be a conflict
between access for the disabled and preservation of
wilderness."
   No one expects the question to be settled soon or the
bitterness to disappear from two sides unwilling to
compromise. "The whole goal of the disabled movement," says
Michael Jenkins, executive director of the Governor's
Commission on Disability in New Hampshire, "is that 20 years
from now there won't be any issues like this."

   Equimark Fees
   For Texas Bank
   Are Challenged

   U.S. Seeks Reimbursement
   For Management Costs
   Of National Bancshares

   PITTSBURGH -- Federal regulators told Equimark Corp. they
will request reimbursement for expenses the bank holding
company charged the federal government while managing an
insolvent Texas bank.
   Equimark charged the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. more
than $10 million for its nine-month management of National
Bancshares Corp. of Texas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among the alleged expenses is a charge of about $1,400,
apparently for transporting from Pittsburgh to Texas a 1962
black Rolls-Royce owned by Equimark Chairman Alan S.
Fellheimer.
   FDIC Chairman William Seidman said that until the agency
reviews Equimark's records, he isn't sure how much Equimark
will be asked to reimburse. "But it may run into the
millions," he said. "There are a lot of questions about the
kinds of things that were charged when then were running
{National Bancshares} on our behalf."
   Mr. Fellheimer vigorously denied that Equimark charged the
government with any improper expenses, and he said he
personally paid for transporting his Rolls-Royce. The bill
was less than $1,000, he said.
   "We're prepared to back with documentation every nickel we
charged them," Mr. Fellheimer said.
   The FDIC, however, said Equimark incurred "questionable
expenses" for lodging, travel and a data processing system it
installed at National Bancshares. Alan J. Whitney, an FDIC
spokesman, said the agency sent Mr. Fellheimer a letter July
17 requesting documentation for expenses incurred in San
Antonio, Texas.
   Regulators first informed Mr. Fellheimer in April that
they planned to request documentation about expenses, Mr.
Whitney said.
   Among other things, the inquiry seems to center on bills
run up by Equimark employees who shuttled between Pittsburgh
and San Antonio. Most stayed in hotels.
   Mr. Fellheimer contended that he hadn't yet received the
FDIC letter and said regulators make frequent requests for
increased documentation.
   The inquiry is the latest problem in Equimark's failed
attempt to acquire National Bancshares in a $116 million
federally assisted buy-out. The acquisition was to be the
centerpiece of Mr. Fellheimer's driving ambition to expand
the bank beyond Pennsylvania.
   The attempt proved costly. The deal collapsed in April
when National Bancshares' bondholders rejected the offer and
regulators refused to allow Equimark to sweeten the deal.
Consequently Equimark took a $3.7 million charge for employee
severance packages and other items.
   The FDIC request comes at a time when Mr. Fellheimer is
under increasing criticism from Equimark directors. In May,
the board deliberated for six hours over whether he would
keep his job. While they voted to retain Mr. Fellheimer, he
must stem losses from bad real-estate and consumer loans and
ill-fated acquisitions in Idaho and Philadelphia.
   In the second quarter Equimark had a loss of $29.8 million
before one-time gains from the sale of a credit-card unit. In
the past 12 months, its share price has fallen more than 60%.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Equimark shares closed at $5.125, unchanged.
   Regulators aren't the only ones to raise eyebrows over the
$10 million payment. At a U.S. bankruptcy court hearing in
San Antonio earlier this month, National Bancshares creditors
gasped when they learned the bank had paid that much money,
and banking experts have said the amount seems extravagant.
   National Bancshares executives have said the fees were
determined in a contract between the FDIC and Equimark. While
National Bancshares technically paid Equimark, in effect it
was FDIC money because the Texas bank was insolvent.
   While Equimark ran National Bancshares, it instituted an
aggressive marketing campaign, set up a telephone loan line
and threw customer parties at bank branches and country
clubs.

   Soviets Will Sell Diamonds to De Beers's
   Swiss Arm, Borrow $1 Billion From Firm

   LONDON -- The cash-strapped Soviet Union is selling
diamonds worth $5 billion to the Swiss arm of De Beers
Consolidated Mines Ltd. and is borrowing $1 billion from the
company.
   The contract between De Beers Centenary AG and
Glavalmazzoloto, the Soviet adminstration for precious metals
and diamonds, is for the exclusive sale of Soviet rough uncut
diamonds over five years, said Gary Ralfe, a director of De
Beers Centenary. The company also received $1 billion of
diamonds as collateral, and Mr. Ralfe said these diamonds
would be sold during the five-year period to redeem the debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The deal obviously suits both parties, London diamond
dealers say. The Soviet Union has been having difficulty
paying its overseas trade creditors, and De Beers wants to
stop the Soviet Union and other producing nations from
selling increasing amounts of diamonds outside the De Beers
diamond cartel.
   De Beers is negotiating new sales contracts with Botswana
and Australia, so guaranteed diamond supplies from the
Soviets will encourage other members to toe the line, dealers
said. The South African cartel, which controls 80% of the
international rough diamond market, sells stones from its own
mines and those of other African countries, Australia and
elsewhere through its London-based Central Selling
Organization.
   While De Beers Centenary is a Swiss company, Mr. Ralfe
said the sale represented the first time in nearly three
decades that the Soviet Union had openly associated itself
with commodities dealings linked to a South African company.
South Africa and the Soviet Union are the world's biggest
producers of gold, platinum and a variety of strategic
metals, and in the past few years sometimes surreptitiously
cooperated on sales tactics, dealers say. The Soviet Union,
for example, sold its diamonds to the De Beers diamond cartel
through intermediaries, Mr. Ralfe said.
   "This is a very important deal for both the Soviet Union
and De Beers," said Nicholas Oppenheimer, deputy chairman of
De Beers. The Soviet Union is raising $1 billion at a time of
considerable financial strain, while the contract will
contribute to the continued stability and prosperity of the
international diamond industry, he said.
   Estimates that the Soviet Union produces 12 million carats
of diamonds a year, or 13% of world output, are conservative,
Mr. Ralfe said. Its mines in the Yaktia region of
northeastern Siberia are rich, and the Soviet Union and
Botswana are the two largest producers of gem diamonds in the
world, he said.
   Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of Gosbank, the Soviet state
bank, announced previously that the Soviet Union would sell
and deposit gold and other commodities as collateral to raise
about $2.5 billion. Indeed, about 200 to 300 metric tons of
gold deposited as collateral with Western banks, has already
been "swapped" for foreign exchange, bullion dealers
estimate. The nation is forced to use commodities as
collateral for loans because delays in payments to suppliers
in the West and Japan are discouraging foreign banks from
lending it money, analysts say.
   Those sales may already be having an effect: Just
yesterday, a Japanese trade organization reported that
Moscow's overdue payments for Japanese exports had leveled
off in June, after rising for six straight months. The group
said payment arrears by Soviet trading organizations totaled
$446 million at the end of June, only a $2 million increase
from May. The trade group attributed the leveling off both to
increased payments by the Soviets and to the fact that
Japan's trading houses were more hesitant about doing
business with Soviet concerns.
   "I believe this problem is passing its peak," an official
of one major Japanese trading house told Japan's Kyodo news
service.
   Moscow's foreign borrowings amounted to as much as $43
billion at the end of 1989, estimates the Bank for
International Settlements.

   Brokerage Firms Urged to Speed
   Arbitration Awards to Investors

   NEW YORK -- Brokerage firms soon will have to put the
check in the mail faster when they lose an arbitration case
brought by an investor.
   This is because an arbitration rule-making group, spurred
by a rise in complaints from investors who say they have
waited as long as 90 days to collect, is prodding the firms
to accelerate payment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Take Edward Strehlau. He won $6,000 in an arbitration case
from Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in April. Weeks rolled by
with no sign of the money. Early this week, he finally
received the check -- mistakenly made out to his lawyer.
   "You wait and wait and wait," Mr. Strehlau, an unemployed
salesman, says, "and then you end up losing all the
interest."
   Under new rules approved by the Securities Industry
Conference on Arbitration, most major arbitration forums will
soon require securities firms to pay investors within 30 days
of an arbitration decision. Until now, there hadn't been any
strict guidelines on how quickly firms had to pay.
   Most of them typically pay within 90 days, which is their
time limit to move to have decisions set aside. This period
won't be changed.
   Firms still could delay payment for as long as 90 days,
but only if they filed a challenge within a month after the
award was ordered. As a result, industry self-regulatory
groups believe they will be in a better position to take
enforcement action against any foot-dragging firms.
   "It's really the coercive value of having regulators
hopping on delinquent payments that's most effective," says
Richard P. Ryder, editor of the Securities Arbitration
Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J., newsletter.
   Payments have been delayed in part because brokerage firms
have been swamped with a heavy arbitration caseload in recent
years. But they also have benefited from paying late, because
they weren't required to tack on interest when mailing these
checks to investors.
   The newly issued directive from SICA, an ad-hoc group that
proposes arbitration rules, will prod most arbitration forums
to require securities firms to pay interest on awards from
the date they are issued. This will give the firms added
incentive to make the payments to investors quickly.
   The upshot: Customers will see their money faster. And
this, legal specialists say, will help build confidence in a
system that is supposed to be far speedier than going to
court.
   Some arbitration forums already have tough payment
guidelines. The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which
handles municipal-bond cases, last year began requiring
brokerage firms to pay investors within 20 days of an award.
Even if a firm disputes an award, it still must put the
amount in an escrow account.
   Board officials say they decided to act, after a few small
firms delayed paying investors because they knew they were
soon going to be out of business.
   "It appears that a number of dealers don't pay arbitration
awards until the very end of the appeal period, even when
they have no intention of bringing an appeal," the board
stated before adopting the rules.
   The SICA also has approved other rules that most
arbitration forums will soon adopt. Some fees beyond the
award, such as forum fees, must be paid immediately following
the arbitrators' decision.
   And investors will be able to join in filing arbitration
cases with others who have similar complaints, such as
disputes arising out of similar transactions involving a
securities firm or broker. To file such a joint case until
now, a direct relationship has had to be shown among the
claimants, such as being members of the same investment club.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers and the New
York Stock Exchange, which together handle more than 90% of
all arbitration cases, say investors won't have to wait long
to feel the effect of the new rules. The NASD says it will
approve them by autumn. The Big Board hopes to approve them
in the next several weeks.

   TAXES
</CO>
<LP>
   California, home of the tax revolt, currently also is an
object lesson in the inexorable pressures for more government
spending.
   This week Republican Governor George Deukmejian and his
legislative adversaries are about $2 billion apart on a
budget that's now nearly a month overdue. Governor Deukmejian
is tired of the revenue race to keep up with what are now 11%
annual spending rises, and wants reform of built-in
expenditure escalators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Democrats want to make up the $2 billion in tax and
fee hikes and some piecemeal paring of expenses by Mr.
Deukmejian. By one estimate, a California family of four
already faces $230 extra annually from gas and sales tax
boosts this past year. Budget talks are going on this week,
and the big question is how far Mr. Deukmejian will retreat.
   All this even though Mr. Deukmejian, like most governors,
has a line-item veto. And even though, by a longstanding
rule, fiscal policies require a two-thirds legislative
approval.
   This would seem to be a strong institutional protection
against overspending and overtaxing. Similar supermajority
requirements exist in some form in six other states:
Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and South
Dakota. The record on them is mixed, depending on the
opposition party and the local economy. But usually, as in
California, spending is damped initially but then seems to
start rising again.
   Yet at least the citizens of California keep trying to
find ways to keep the government in check. A secondary
element of Proposition 13, the famous 1978 citizen measure to
cut property taxes, required a two-thirds threshold for all
local tax and bond issues. Of 26 tax and bond measures in
Southern California on the ballot in June, half won a
majority but fell short of two-thirds. Eleven of the 13 that
failed got more than 60%.
   That evidence might suggest there's such a built-in vote
for bigger government that a two-thirds cutoff is about the
level needed to distinguish which extraordinary items have
true consensus approval. To majority-rule devotees, we would
only suggest that with most adult citizens not even voting,
approval by two-thirds of those who do cast ballots is a
reasonable proxy for majority assent from the larger
community.
   California law provides that statewide bonds and taxes, as
opposed to local ones, need only 50%-plus-one approval. In
June voters okayed every one of the seven such measures,
including lulus for monorails and the homeless. The word is
out that if you've got some pet cause for which you want a
few hundred million, put a bond issue on the state ballot and
tell the voters they won't have to pay for it in higher
taxes. Odds are about 53% of those voting will believe you.
   A more recent twist is to petition for a special tax on an
unpopular industry -- cigarettes and booze so far; oil,
insurance, banks sure to follow -- and earmark the proceeds
for Mom and Apple Pie. The remnants of Howard Jarvis's army
are onto this game, however, and have qualified a measure of
their own for the November state ballot that would impose the
big two-thirds requirement on these taxes as well as local
"fees." (Ironically, this proposition, too, needs only 50%
plus one to pass.)
   California makes clear that institutional checks on
spending and taxing are far from foolproof. It makes as
clear, though, just how powerful pressures for new spending
are, especially when buttressed by low turnouts in elections
and gerrymandering of legislative districts. Given these
realities, something like the two-thirds tourniquet is not
much to ask.

   There are issues in every land that simply must be
addressed. Abortion was one of them, civil rights was
another, capital punishment a third, the right to die a
fourth. And when Congress ran away from those issues or wrote
laws so full of passion and devoid of reason or detail as to
be incomprehensible, the Supreme Court moved in. . . . A
proper response by Souter to the most zealous questioners
might be: "You write clear and concise laws for the nation
establishing a right of privacy, defining the times and terms
on which people may create a life or end one, declaring what
are and are not permissible hiring practices, stating what is
and what is not to be admissible evidence, and I will have no
trouble limiting myself to the traditional role of
determining the constitutionality of your actions. Until I
see what you have produced, however, I cannot tell you
whether I would find it constitutional or not."

   Market Rebounds to End Six-Session
   Losing Streak; Microsoft Gains 2 to 71 1/2

   Investors breathed some life back into over-the-counter
stocks.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.89 to 445.45, a 0.65%
gain, ending a six-session losing streak and outpacing a 0.3%
rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Advancing shares
overtook decliners, 1,097 to 782.

<TEXT>
   However, the number of shares hitting new lows continued
to outnumber those reaching new highs, 99 to 45. Volume fell
to 141.6 million shares from 160.5 million Tuesday.
   The hard-hit technology sector bounced back, fueling a
0.9% advance in the Nasdaq Industrial Index. Shares of
Microsoft rebounded 2 to 71 1/2 shortly before the software
leader reported net income for the fourth quarter ended June
30 rose to 65 cents a share from 40 cents a year earlier.
   "It's still an earnings-driven market," said Jim O'Neill,
co-manager of OTC trading for Robinson-Humphrey Co. While Mr.
O'Neill said the selling pressure on smaller stocks abated
somewhat, he added that investors "aren't stepping over each
other to buy them." William A. Rothe, managing director of
OTC trading at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons, agreed that investors were
selective yesterday.
   Earnings reported late Tuesday by Seagate Technology
generally dispelled fears about weakness in the disk-drive
sector, which had been "running rampant" in advance of the
report, according to Montgomery Securities analyst Paul G.
Fox.
   Yesterday, Mr. Fox and his colleague, Steven L. Ossad,
switched a "hold" opinion issued Tuesday on Maxtor, a Seagate
competitor, to a "buy" opinion, after the stock's 26% plunge
Tuesday on what they called overreaction to fears about the
sector.
   Mr. Fox said in an interview that disk-drive inventory
levels appear very healthy and said he believes concerns in
advance of Seagate's report were excessive. Trading at a
multiple of 6.9 times 1990 earnings after its 26% drop
Tuesday, Maxtor is the cheapest among the disk-drive stocks,
he noted. Seagate gained 1/8 to 12 1/2; Maxtor eased 1/2 to
10 1/4.
   Among other technology issues, AST Research climbed 2 1/4
to 22 5/8 after the Irvine, Calif., maker of
personal-computer systems reported that net income for the
fourth quarter ended June 30 jumped to $1.18 a share from 21
cents a year earlier.
   Sun Microsystems added 1 5/8 to 33 1/2 after the maker of
computer workstations said it authorized MicroAge of Tempe,
Ariz., to distribute its Sparc-based workstations. MicroAge
rose 1 3/4 to 16 1/4.
   Cellular Communications was the day's most-active stock,
falling 2 1/4 to 33 on nearly 2.8 million shares. The New
York company agreed to combine cellular operations in Ohio
and Michigan with Pacific Telesis Group. Pacific Telesis also
will buy 5% of Cellular Communications' stock and has the
option of buying the remainder of the company over the next 5
1/2 years. Cellular Communications also announced other
transactions, which include spinning off its international
and long-distance microwave interests to the public.
   Evans &amp; Sutherland Computer soared 4 to 29 1/4 after word
reached investors that the Salt Lake City maker of
three-dimensional graphics systems will be a subcontractor to
Loral Corp. on a $71.5 million Air Force contract, Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report said. A company spokeswoman said
details of the award aren't available yet.
   Earnings reports continued to bruise stocks.
   Advo-System slipped 5/8 to 10 7/8 on nearly 1.2 million
shares. The Windsor, Conn., provider of direct-mail
advertising services reported late Tuesday that net income
for the third quarter ended June 30 rose slightly to 34 cents
a share from 32 cents a year earlier.
   Datron Systems tumbled 1 to 6 3/4 after the Simi Valley,
Calif., maker of satellite-communication and radar systems
reported net income for the first quarter ended June 30
dropped to six cents a share from 28 cents a year earlier.
   Alliant Computer eased 3/8 to 4 3/8. The Littleton, Mass.,
maker of computer systems said that it expects to report a
loss for the third quarter ending in September "similar" to a
loss of nine cents a share reported yesterday for the second
quarter ended June 30. Alliant attributed the weak outlook to
seasonally sluggish business in European business and
difficulties related to a new product. The company earned
three cents a share in the year-earlier second quarter.
   Chips &amp; Technologies lost 1 1/4 to 16 1/4, although
earnings reported late Tuesday by the San Jose, Calif.,
company fell within analysts' expectations. The stock dropped
on nearly four times average volume after Sutro &amp; Co.
electronics and computing analyst John Nguyen repeated a
long-standing "sell" recommendation, according to DJPIR. Mr.
Nguyen said he continues to believe the company's gross
profit margins will be pressured by a softening personal
computer market and intensifying competition in the
personal-computer chipset business.
   North Side Savings Bank fell 1/2 to 8 after the bank
reported a loss for the third quarter ended June 30 of $2.42
a share, widened from a loss of 75 cents a year earlier. The
most recent quarter included a $1.76-million loan-loss
provision, which North Side said it took to "aggressively
confront the current real estate environment."
   Calgon Carbon fell 1/2 to 45 3/4, although the Pittsburgh
maker of activated carbons reported net income for the second
quarter ended June 30 rose to 54 cents a share from 47 cents
a year earlier. The figure matched a consensus of analysts'
estimates reported by First Call, a subsidiary of Thomson
Financial Networks.
   Bizmart skidded 1 3/4 to 14 3/8 after Alex. Brown &amp; Sons
analyst Chris E. Vroom lowered his earnings estimate for the
Arlington, Texas, retailer of office products, according to
DJPIR and a employee of the brokerage firm. Alex. Brown was
the lead underwriter for a 2.75-million share offering of
Bizmart's shares on July 18 priced at $15.75 apiece; delivery
of the stock was scheduled for yesterday. Mr. Vroom was not
immediately available for comment.

   CHEVRON Corp. boosted its quarterly dividend to 77.5 cents
a share from 70 cents, payable Sept. 10 to stock of record
Aug. 6. The San Francisco-based oil company said the increase
reflected the company's strong earnings and cash flow for the
first half of 1990. Earlier this week Chevron reported a 60%
increase in second-quarter net income to $648 million, or
$1.83 a share, after $58 million of gains. Revenue rose 8.5%

   Merck-Du Pont Venture Certain to Stir Drug Industry

   Merck &amp; Co., responding to mergers that have reshaped the
pharmaceutical industry over the past two years, is teaming
up with chemical giant Du Pont Co. to form a new company.
   Under terms of the agreement, the two companies will own,
in a 50-50 partnership, Du Pont's entire pharmaceutical
operation, which is expected to post sales of $550 million
this year. Merck will provide the new company with foreign
marketing rights to some prescription medicines plus an
undisclosed amount of cash.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The deal is certain to shake up the world-wide drug
industry, which is undergoing cataclysmic changes as
companies merge and forge alliances with one another in
unprecedented numbers. "The rules are changing very fast,"
said Edgar S. Woolard Jr., Du Pont's chairman and chief
executive officer. "Because of all the recent consolidations
taking place, the risk of going it alone is much, much higher
than five years ago."
   By joining forces with Du Pont, Merck sends a sharp signal
that it is willing to take unusually aggressive steps to keep
its place atop the U.S. drug industry. The move is certain to
raise concern at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., whose recent
merger was an effort to take aim at Merck.
   As importantly, the agreement shows that the high cost of
developing new drugs is daunting even for a company as
successful as Merck. In order to keep profits robust, drug
makers must discover breakthrough medicines that can garner
premium prices. But the expensive cost of biomedical
technology these days means that even Merck can't make those
kinds of discoveries alone.
   Under the new venture, called Du Pont Merck
Pharmaceuticals Co., Merck, already acclaimed as the premier
drug research company in the U.S., will get access to all of
Du Pont's experimental drugs and its small but productive
research operation. Merck's top officials said they broached
the idea of a partnership last year in an effort to obtain
new drugs needed to maintain Merck's rapid profit growth.
   "We're convinced that we have to increase our access to
R&amp;D if we want to increase our world-wide market share" of
the pharmaceutical business, said Roy Vagelos, chairman and
chief executive of Merck. Outright acquisitions of other drug
makers would be too costly, he said. Instead, "we looked to a
company with a top-notch research operation, but that needed
the marketing and development skills we could offer."
   Although Merck's list of drugs and its research pipeline
is the envy of many drug makers, company officials conceded
that they needed outside help to sustain Merck as a "premium
growth company," said Francis Spiegel, the company's senior
vice president.
   Merck officials have smarted from some analysts' criticism
that the company couldn't maintain its past performance.
Merck profit growth has slowed this year as the company
pumped up R&amp;D funding to $750 million and spent heavily to
increase the size of its sales force. Earnings for the first
six months of 1990 rose 18.6% to $874 million, or $2.23 a
share, ending four years of quarterly profit increases of 25%
or more.
   Company officials also say that the merger that formed
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. galvanized their belief that they
needed to increase the company's product line faster than
Merck's R&amp;D operation could manage on its own. Other recent
mergers have produced SmithKline Beecham Corp. and Marion
Merrell Dow Inc. Meanwhile, American Home Products Corp.
acquired A.H. Robins Co., Hoffmann-La Roche acquired 60% of
Genentech Inc., and Eastman Kodak Co. acquired Sterling Drug
Co.
   "This is our answer to all that," Mr. Spiegel said. "It
gets us more aggressive, gives us more access to product and
helps us strengthen our global business. We accomplish all
those objectives without paying the huge premiums that can
dilute current earnings and without the problems associated
with melding two corporations." Both companies said the
agreement won't dilute their earnings.
   Dr. Vagelos said he expects products from Du Pont's
research to help Merck "have medicines to treat every major
type of illness." The company believes that in coming years
it will need a broad product line to negotiate with health
insurance plans and hospitals joining forces to buy medicines
at discounted prices.
   For Du Pont, the venture will mean a much-needed presence
abroad as well as the chance to share in the revenue of
certain Merck products. Under the agreement, the new venture
will sell several Merck products in West Germany, France,
Italy, Great Britain and Spain. In particular, it will
eventually have the right to co-market, along with Merck,
Merck's experimental drug Proscar, a drug for treating
enlarged prostates that is expected to generate huge sales
when approved for use.
   "We realized that if we ever were going to make it as a
drug company we needed to be able to sell our new products in
foreign markets," said Joseph Mollica, a Du Pont vice
president who will head the new venture. Mr. Mollica said the
foreign operation, which he expects to expand to Japan, will
generate revenue one to two years earlier than if Du Pont
waited for the drugs to gain approval in the U.S., where drug
approvals come slower than abroad.
   Most importantly, Merck will help Du Pont push new drugs
through its pipeline, the companies' officials said. Du
Pont's researchers get high marks in the industry for several
novel drugs, including treatments for Alzheimer's disease,
arthritis, pain relief, and others to lower cholesterol and
prevent heart attacks.
   Merck was first attracted to Du Pont last year, after its
researchers beat out several companies, including Merck, in
developing a new drug for high blood pressure called an A2
inhibitor. In October, Merck acquired the rights to
co-develop the drug, and soon afterward proposed the broader
agreement. "Discovering the A2 drug was an outstanding
accomplishment," Dr. Vagelos says. "It showed us a lot about
the quality of their research."
   The venture was announced after the close of trading
yesterday. Merck stock closed at $89 a share, up 50 cents in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Also on the Big
Board, Du Pont shares rose 50 cents to close at $39.375.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Proxy Solicitor Carter Sentenced to Prison

   Donald C. Carter, a once-highflying proxy solicitor, was
sentenced to 16 months to four years in prison and was
ordered to pay $1 million in restitution after his guilty
plea to charges of grand larceny and personal income-tax
evasion.
   In a New York state court, Justice George Roberts also
fined Mr. Carter $50,000. In an investigation, the state
Organized Crime Task Force found that Mr. Carter, former head
of Carter Organization, had overcharged or falsely billed
clients.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The sentence was pursuant to a plea bargain, wherein this
was the maximum possible sentence," said John J. Tigue Jr.,
Mr. Carter's attorney at Kostelanetz Ritholz Tigue &amp; Fink.
"We had earnestly hoped for a lesser sentence and are
obviously disappointed." Mr. Carter will have to serve at
least the minimum of 16 months.
   The fine will be appealed, Mr. Tigue said, but the $1
million restitution has been remitted to the Task Force for
distribution.
   In 1987, Mr. Carter sold his firm for more than $75
million to Britain's VPI Group PLC, which in June renamed it
Quorum Communications Inc. Proxy-solicitation firms solicit
and collect shareholder votes on behalf of corporations.
Yesterday, Quorum announced a separate settlement with the
task force.
   Under the terms, Quorum will retain an auditing firm that
for at least six months will review its business practices
and ensure that clients' restitution claims are handled
properly. In turn, the task force agreed not to bring any
civil or criminal charges against Quorum or its parent.
   Quorum also agreed to pay the state $1 million -- separate
from the restitution payment made by Mr. Carter -- from any
funds it might receive from a civil suit VPI filed against
Mr. Carter in May.
   The civil action, filed in federal court in Manhattan,
accused Mr. Carter, 41 years old, of racketeering, fraud and
breach of contract.
   At the Manhattan law firm Gold &amp; Wachtel, which is
handling the civil action for Mr. Carter, attorney Robert
Gold said Mr. Carter has made a motion to have the suit heard
in state court rather than federal court. VPI's attorneys are
to answer the motion late in August or early in September.
Judge Thomas Griesa is hearing the case.

   REVIEW OF JUDGE SOUTER'S record by the ABA will have new
twists.
   At the request of the Justice Department, the review
already has begun by the 15-member American Bar Association
Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which will vote
to find the Supreme Court nominee either well-qualified,
qualified or not qualified.
   In the past, the ABA panel has solicited analyses of a
nominee's published work from two randomly chosen law-school
faculties and from the lawyers at the Standing Committee
chairman's own law firm.
   But the current chairman, Ralph Lancaster of Portland,
Maine, has added a new twist. In addition to two law-school
faculties -- Stanford and Northwestern are already at work on
Judge Souter -- he has formed an 11-person permanent "reading
committee" of prominent lawyers to digest the nominee's court
opinions and report back.
   The committee, which also has begun working on Judge David
Souter's decisions, is headed by Rex Lee, solicitor-general
in the Reagan administration and now president of Brigham
Young University.
   Among other members are University of Texas law professor
Charles Alan Wright, former federal appeals court Judges
Philip Tone of Chicago and Arlin Adams of Philadelphia,
Philip Lacovara, a top in-house lawyer of General Electric
Co. who will soon move to Morgan Stanley, and Drew Days, a
Yale Law School professor who was Justice Department
civil-rights chief in the Carter administration.
   Mr. Lancaster said the new reading committee was created
to avoid any suggestions of bias on the part of any
individual law firm. "I thought it best to put an independent
group" in place, he said.
   There is another twist, as well. Among members of the ABA
Standing Committee that will vote on Judge Souter's
nomination is William J. Brennan III, a Princeton, N.J.,
lawyer and son of Justice William J. Brennan Jr. whose
retirement created the Supreme Court vacancy.

   FORMER HOUSING OFFICIALS in New Jersey admit to lying to
Congress.
   Two former officials of a HUD-sponsored housing agency in
Passaic, N.J., pleaded guilty to one count each of lying to
Congress and conspiracy to conceal a fraud and kickback
scheme and to evade tax payments.
   Paul A. Marguglio, executive director of the Passaic
Housing Authority for 20 years, and August C. Michaelis,
former attorney for the agency, both entered guilty pleas
before federal Judge Maryanne Trump Barry in Newark.
   Each former official faces a maximum of 10 years in prison
and a fine of as much as $50,000.
   As part of the plea-bargain agreement, Messrs. Marguglio
and Michaelis will cooperate with the House Governmental
Operations Subcommittee on Employment and Housing in
Washington that is investigating allegations of widespread
corruption within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development. The Passaic agency was under contract with HUD
to provide low-income housing.
   A HUD audit report released early this year outlined
evidence showing that almost $1 million in impermissible
expenses were pocketed by Passaic agency officials. Mr.
Marguglio admitted that he conspired with others at the
agency to prevent HUD from uncovering a scheme that allowed
him to earn $125,000 more than his annual salary of $84,000
in 1989 by illegally holding three other agency jobs.
   Mr. Marguglio also pocketed $150,000 in kickbacks paid to
him by Mr. Michaelis so that he could keep his job as agency
counsel. Later, Messrs. Marguglio and Michaelis conspired to
hide the scheme and lied to the House subcommittee about it
in March.
   Messrs. Marguglio and Michaelis are scheduled for
sentencing Oct. 4. Three other Passaic housing officials
previously pleaded guilty to their roles in the kickback
scheme.
   "Today's pleas and the earlier convictions underscore the
fact that corruption and fraud in HUD housing authorities
have been both extensive and pervasive," said Michael
Chertoff, U.S. attorney in Newark.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Massachusetts Lawmakers Backpedal,
   Consider Repeal of New Service Tax

   BOSTON -- In a surprise move, Massachusetts lawmakers are
considering repealing a tax package -- signed into law just
last week -- that levies a 5% sales tax on a host of business
services.
   Instead, legislative leaders are proposing to increase the
income tax to narrow the budget deficit. Whether opponents of
the sales tax can garner enough votes to repeal it remains
unclear, however, as confusion reigned at the state house.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The revised plan was proposed after state legislators, who
had dragged their feet on the recently enacted tax package,
balked at a compromise sought by Gov. Michael Dukakis to get
his $13.7 billion state budget approved earlier this week.
   The about-face follows intense lobbying and legal threats
from professional and business groups -- including lawyers,
accountants, architects and engineers -- that are affected by
the new service tax.
   The latest moves in Massachusetts underscore the crippling
opposition to service taxes that has arisen in various
states. Lobbyists recently have prevailed against similar
taxes in Florida and New York, among other states.
   "We could have warned Massachusetts about this," said
state Rep. William Cibes, chairman of the Connecticut House
of Representatives finance committee, which last year
considered imposing a sales tax on all business and
professional services and then scaled back its plan to a
shadow of its original proposal. "Lobbying was intense, and
we anticipated heavy political reaction," he said. Several
lawmakers in that state are now considering withdrawing a
sales tax on architects and engineers.
   Massachusetts, too, had watered down an earlier proposal
that would have taxed just about every business, excluding
financial, advertising and health services. In addition, the
recently enacted package included several amendments to
minimize out-of-state competition and soften the impact on
smaller firms. But many groups were upset that advertisers,
money managers and financial consultants were able to escape
taxation altogether, while they didn't.
   "In addition to legal problems, the sales-tax plan was
unfair, in the opinion of many," commented Rudolph Pierce,
president of the Boston Bar Association. "For instance,
advertisers as a group arguably are doing better
{financially} than architects" hurt by New England's
real-estate slump, he said. "And some felt that financial
services ended up not getting taxed because Fidelity
{Investments} doesn't want to be taxed." Fidelity, based in
Boston, is the nation's largest mutual-fund investment
manager.
   Lobbying efforts continued even after the bill was passed
last week. The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation Inc., which
represents many businesses, from biotechnology concerns to
heavy-industry manufacturers, "never gave up hope," said
Richard A. Manley, the organization's president. "Many of the
people we represent are just trying to keep body and soul
together. Our position is that the {newest} proposal will do
less damage to the state's economy than the one made law," he
said.
   Under the plan submitted by Gov. Dukakis and approved by
the state House Ways and Means Committee yesterday, the
state's income tax would increase to 6.25% this year,
compared with the current rate of 5.75%.
   Under the new plan, the sales tax on most services would
be repealed, except for a few areas. A 10-cent rise in the
gasoline tax wouldn't be touched.
   The plan, which is similar to one proposed in the
Massachusetts House of Representatives earlier this year, is
likely to be approved by the House. And some think the state
Senate, eager to end the state's budget problems, would
probably follow suit.
   Because the state is quickly running out of cash, and
Standard &amp; Poor's bond-rating service is soon to complete a
review of the state's finances, both houses are expected to
act shortly.
   Unless changed, the tax bill is slated to bring in several
million dollars more than the bill signed into law by Gov.
Dukakis last week. That measure would raise $1.2 billion this
fiscal year and $1.8 billion next fiscal year.

   STATIC AHEAD for electric utilities, consumers,
shareholders, analysts warn.
   Kansas City Power &amp; Light's hostile bid this week for
Kansas Gas &amp; Electric illuminates the state of the electric
power industry: Slapped down on full rate hikes, unable to
pursue nuclear options and worried about future capacity,
utilities consolidate in an attempt to improve profits. "This
is not a stodgy, `widow-and-orphan' industry anymore," says
Daniel Scotto, analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, New
York.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consumers facing peak summer cooling bills may not realize
it, but investor-owned utility rate-hikes slid 12.5% last
year to $1.8 billion, says the Edison Electric Institute. The
industry still generally enjoys excess capacity, a major
reason for flat rates or smallish increases of late. But that
may change five years down the road, says Philip Giudice, of
Temple, Barker &amp; Sloane, Lexington, Mass. He says utilities
"have been able to live off cheap plant and investment"
thanks to a large asset base now near the end of its life.
   For the first time in 20 years, Baltimore G&amp;E and Potomac
Electric used rolling blackouts on one hot day.
                                                                                                       

   BEACHY BOOKS: Unusual best sellers, hot regional titles
fuel summer reading.
   A Danielle Steel book about Vietnam; the history of time
in paperback and the biography of a 19th century British
explorer surprise some booksellers by succeeding amid usually
frothy summer fare. Local books are big, too. Gloria Nagy's
"A House in the Hamptons" is a prime seller in East Hampton,
on Long Island. In San Francisco, a reissue of "Ringo Levio"
by '60s artist Emmett Grogan sells well at Booksmith.
   "It's an unreported phenomenon that in many areas of the
country there are books that touch the heartstrings of
locals," says Bill Rickman, president of Kroch's and
Brentano's, Chicago. He notes the Windy City's Sara Paretsky,
whose "Burn Marks" features a female private eye. Also a
local: Scott Turow, whose "The Burden of Proof" tops Chicago
and national best-seller lists. Book Hampton tells of
shoppers who simply want to stock the library, like the woman
who recently bought an armload to keep weekend guests amused.
Her literary requirements? "She wanted all hard covers,"
drawls the manager.
                                                                                                       

   BAILOUT FALLOUT: Bank statements bulge with deposit
insurance rule changes.
   Home mailboxes grow heavy with notices about new federal
deposit insurance rules that take hold next week. Regulators
admit most people won't be affected by the largely technical
changes, but banks and thrifts are required to notify all
depositors. Changes stem from last year's thrift bailout law
that eliminated the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
and mandated that rules for S&amp;Ls and for banks be reconciled
under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The important thing remains the same: most deposits still
are insured up to $100,000. Individual, joint and trust
accounts are all insured separately. The changes do affect
some husband-and-wife trust accounts. Previously, the
couple's trust account at an S&amp;L naming each other as
beneficiaries could be insured up to $200,000. Now, such an
account is insured only up to $100,000. But the full $200,000
can still be insured if the couple splits it into two
separate accounts of $100,000, each naming the other
beneficiary.
   Account ownership is critical in determining insurance
coverage, says Claude Rollin, senior FDIC attorney.
                                                                                                       

   KIDS COME FIRST. NCNB Corp., a Charlotte, N.C. bank,
encourages its 30,000 employees to help schools by allowing
workers up to two hours' paid time a week for things such as
tutoring, coaching, or PTA activity.
                                                                                                       

   PEARLY GATE LEG-UP? American Express's Ayco unit offers a
program that will donate $1 million to a director's favored
charity on his demise. "The director can, in effect, take
credit before he's dead," a spokesman says.
                                                                                                       

   NO-CRUNCH CREDIT: The total number of credit cards in the
U.S. topped one billion in June, says the Nilson Report.
Consumers currently use plastic to pay for $28 out of every
$100 spent on consumable goods and services, it adds.
                                                                                                       

   THE PAY'S THE THING on Broadway as musicals tap dance over
serious plays.
   Tickets to the most popular shows like "The Phantom of the
Opera" and "Les Miserables" are $60 -- when they're
available. When they're not, "ticket brokers" command as much
as $200 for an orchestra seat. Even "scalpers," who hawk
tickets outside theaters, charge less. Heavy prices for light
entertainment give rise to a counter-move. A plan from the
Broadway Alliance would help production of non-musicals.
Tickets would be $10 to $24.
   For now, a family of three could easily pay over $200 for
tickets to a show plus a bite to eat. For that price, they
want the kind of spectacle that makes theater just another
tourist attraction, some say. "Come to New York, see the
Empire State Building, the U.N., and `Cats,'" laments
Benjamin Mordecai, producer of "The Piano Lesson." But try
the discount booths first; it could mean big savings on
available tickets.
   Average weekly gross for: "Gypsy," $500,000; "Grand
Hotel," $450,000; "The Piano Lesson," $175,000-$190,000.

   Iroquois officials said gas probably won't start flowing
to the energy-hungry Northeast by the scheduled start-up date
of November 1991, but they said the delay likely wouldn't be
significant.

   FERC commissioners, who had been expected to issue a
certificate allowing construction on the 369-mile, $582.6
million project to begin, instead stunned the project's
supporters by ordering a hearing for "public policy" reasons.
The hearing is intended to review the need for the gas and
the project's proposed rate structure.
   The order calling for the hearing means that the fate of
the project won't be decided until late November at the
earliest, commissioners said. The project calls for shipping
about 575.9 million cubic feet of gas daily to the Northeast.
   Edward Sondey, vice president of gas supply, Brooklyn
Union Gas Co., said he was "disappointed and shocked" by the
decision to call a hearing rather than issue a certificate
for the pipeline, adding that the issues surrounding Iroquois
have been "hashed and rehashed" in many different forums in
the last three years.
   "We had counted on beginning service in 1991," Mr. Sondey
said. The New York-based utility, which has an 11.1% stake in
the Iroquois project, is one of the largest customers for the
Canadian natural gas.
   Robert Reid, president of the Iroquois Gas Transmission
System consortium, said that the order will delay
construction of the pipeline, which had been scheduled to
begin in early 1991. Iroquois officials said they haven't yet
determined whether it will affect the pipeline's proposed
start-up date.
   A group of U.S. natural gas producers welcomed the FERC
decision, saying that "approval of the project would not have
been in the public interest." The Independent Petroleum
Association of America, along with other Iroquois opponents,
argues that the need for the project hasn't been demonstrated
and that the proposed rate structure discriminates against
U.S. domestic producers.
   Brooklyn Union's Mr. Sondey said that he met with IPAA
members on four occasions to negotiate a gas-supply contract
before the utility decided to buy Canadian gas. "They weren't
willing to meet our conditions," he said. "The Canadians
were. If (domestic producers) aren't willing to compete, they
should just pack their bags and go home."
   FERC Commissioner Elizabeth Moler, who voted against
holding the hearing, argued not only that there is a
demonstrated need for the project, but that the FERC is
treating Iroquois differently from the way it approaches
comparable U.S. projects.
   While its sponsors remain optimistic that Iroquois
eventually will get FERC approval, other observers, noting
the highly charged atmosphere surrounding the project, are
less bullish.
   "Now we have a new procedure, it creates the potential for
a different outcome than we all originally expected to see:
approval of Iroquois," said Roger Berliner, a Washington
natural-gas market analyst.
   A $2.2 billion expansion of Trans-Canada PipeLines Ltd.'s
main line, needed to transport the gas to the U.S. border, is
also bogged down by separate regulatory issues in Ottawa.
Canada's National Energy Board is expected to rule on the
Trans-Canada project by year end.

   You make a critically important point in your July 2
editorial "Mr. Bush's Leadership." Democracy cannot work if
candidates for office do not fulfill their campaign promises
at least as often as they break them. The increasingly low
voter turnout in national elections reflects cynicism about
the process.
   President Carter contributed significantly to this
disaffection after his election in 1976, in which he pledged
to end control of energy, end the double taxing of dividends,
and vowed never to give up the Panama Canal. All three
pledges were abandoned soon after his inauguration.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Those who continue to vote are those who still think they
can tell an honest promise from a cynical one. President Bush
was so emphatic in his pledge not to raise taxes that he
seemed a good bet at the time. He still has not broken his
pledge, although it is certainly bent. If the package he
negotiates with the Democratic Congress is seen to be in the
spirit of his pledge, which has economic growth as the
objective, the electorate will understand the bending of his
promise.
   The worst recent example of political cynicism is New
Jersey Gov. James Florio's decision to push mammoth tax
increases through the Legislature his party controls. He had
indicated he would raise taxes only as a last resort. Had he
presented anything like the plan that now makes the New
Jersey income tax effectively the highest in the nation, it
is impossible to imagine him being elected.
   It is also difficult to imagine Gov. Florio getting his
package through the Legislature if he had permitted time for
public hearings. But he did not give the electorate a chance
to express itself in this manner either, leaving the
impression that he simply does not trust his own constituents
to have valid opinions -- a common trait in authoritarian
regimes. Californians, on the other hand, protect themselves
against this kind of political arrogance, through the
initiative and referendum process. Their recent decision to
permit tax increases through this process has to be
considered a correct one, as it derives from the collective
wisdom of the electorate.
   The Florio package already is leading to movements in New
Jersey to acquire the protection of the initiative and
referendum. If politicians at the national level cannot
manage to keep their most ardent campaign pledges, there
surely will be movements at that level for national
referendum and initiative.

   Computer Maker's Deficit
   Tied to Severence Costs;
   4th-Period Revenue Fell

   Digital Equipment Corp. reported the first net loss in its
32-year history after a $400 million charge for severance and
other costs in its fourth quarter, ended June 30.
   The No. 2 computer maker also reported a 3.7% revenue
decline as business in previously robust European markets
slowed unexpectedly. Digital, like many other established
computer makers, has suffered in the past year as customers
held down spending and switched some of their purchases to
personal computers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although Maynard, Mass.-based Digital's results were worse
than most analysts had forecast, Digital's stock dropped only
slightly. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Digital was down 62.5 cents at $74.875 on volume of more than
1.1 million shares.
   Analysts said investors approved of Digital's plan to cut
an additional 5,000 to 6,000 jobs and that they look for an
upturn in future quarters.
   Looking to fiscal 1991, "I think we'll see steadily
improving results, with the biggest improvement in the second
half," said Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities.
   John Smith, Digital's senior vice president, said, "We're
fairly optimistic about the future. It definitely will come
back. The question is how fast."
   Digital reported a net loss for the quarter of $256.7
million, or $2.11 a share, after taking the $400 million
pretax charge. Without the charge, Digital said, net income
would have been $85.3 million, or 68 cents a share. Many
analysts had predicted earnings of about $1 a share before
any restructuring charge. A year earlier, Digital had net of
$313.2 million, or $2.51 a share.
   Digital's results reflected an unexpectedly large revenue
decline to $3.37 billion from $3.49 billion. Sales of
computers and other products dropped 8.4% to $2.06 billion,
while service revenue rose narrowly.
   The $400 million charge will pay for retraining and
relocating workers for new jobs and providing severance pay
for 5,000 to 6,000 who choose a severance option. Digital
announced a $150 million charge in April for voluntary
severance programs, and the programs have resulted in the
departure of about 3,000 workers, Digital said. Currently
Digital has about 124,000 workers. Mr. Smith said the firm
plans to reduce the work force to about 119,000.
   Mr. Smith said the new severance programs are likely to be
less generous than the past one, which provided as much as
two years' pay for senior employees as well as health and
stock benefits. However, he said, the company will maintain
its practice of avoiding layoffs. He said, "We don't
contemplate any further restructuring costs."
   Mr. Smith warned that the staff reduction won't have its
full cost-cutting impact until the end of fiscal 1991.
   For fiscal 1990, Digital's net fell 93% to $74.4 million,
or 59 cents a share, after $550 million in restructuring
charges. In fiscal 1989, Digital had net of $1.07 billion, or
$8.45 a share. Revenue rose 1.6% to $12.94 billion from
$12.74 billion.
   Looking at the weak sales, stock analysts promptly cut
their earnings estimates for fiscal 1991. Jay P. Stevens of
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., who recommends Digital stock, cut
his estimate to $7.25 a share from $8. Steven Milunovich of
First Boston Corp., who doesn't recommend the stock, cut his
estimate to $5.50 a share from $6.80.
   Analysts were especially worried by Digital's statement
that sales in continental Europe were weaker than expected in
the fourth quarter. While its U.K. business had been
depressed by high interest rates, other European countries
were a bright spot for Digital and most other computer makers
until now. Digital got 56% of its revenue outside the U.S. in
fiscal 1990.
   Bulls on Digital say the company is entering a product
cycle that will boost earnings. The company said production
problems with the VAX 9000, a mainframe that was sold to a
few customers in June, have been solved. Mr. Smith said
Digital expects to ship 100 of the new machines this quarter
and more in future quarters. The early models have an average
selling price of about $1.2 million, although when more
expensive models are on sale by the end of December, Digital
has said, the average selling price will be about $1.6
million.
   Digital could use the boost. Its revenue from high-end
products has dwindled as customers waited for the new
machines.
   Digital said its VAX 4000 series, announced this month, is
selling strongly. Mr. Smith said shipments of engineering
workstations "are doing better than we anticipated" and that
midrange systems "seem to be hanging in there."
   Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded
Digital's long-term debt rating to double-A-2 from triple-A.
The downgrade, which covers about $100 million of 12 5/8%
senior long-term notes due in 1994, reflects a Moody's
opinion that "Digital's earnings will be under stress over
the intermediate term as it reorganizes its operations in
line with slowed revenue growth, thinner margins and a change
in the product mix."
   Moody's said Digital's balance sheet "remains
exceptionally strong." Digital has $2 billion in cash, and
its current assets are more than twice current liabilities. A
Digital spokesman said the Moody's move "doesn't surprise
us," as the rating concern "had held conversations with us."

   An Irishman in Jail Equals a Cuban Out on Bail

   Orlando Bosch is a Cuban, convicted felon, a man once
charged with masterminding the bombing of a civilian airliner
in which 73 people died. On July 17 he was paroled in Miami
and is now, somewhat relatively speaking, a free man. He has
to wear an electronic ankle trace bracelet, can go outside
only three hours a day, must not speak to anti-Castro
militants, and has his phone tapped.
   Joe Doherty is an Irishman, neither charged with nor
convicted of any offense against U.S. criminal law. On June
18 he began his eighth year in a tiny cell in the
Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan; he is now the
longest-held prisoner in the history of that institution. No
less than eight times -- most recently only a few weeks ago
in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit -- he has
prevailed in court and Immigration and Naturalization Service
hearings against attempts by the U.S. government to deport
him.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yet today, Bosch is free on parole and Doherty, denied
bail, is confined to a matchbox cell in a prison never
designed for long-term occupancy, hence offering none of the
facilities other prisons are compelled to offer. See the
double standard maintained by the Bush administration eager
to pander to political friends in Miami's Cuban-American
community, and in London.
   Start with Bosch. In 1968, his anti-Castro group Accion
Cubana blew up a Japanese freighter in Tampa, damaged a
British vessel off Key West and bombed eight diplomatic or
tourist offices in New York and Los Angeles. The aim was to
punish nations doing business with Cuba. Bosch was convicted
that same year of firing a bazooka at a Polish freighter in
Miami harbor and sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. He
was paroled four years later and in 1974 fled the country
rather than honor a subpoena in a murder case. Though both
the Venezuelan and Costa Rican governments offered to send
him back as a parole violator, the Justice Department
exhibited no interest in his return.
   In June 1976, Bosch's Accion Cubana met in the Dominican
Republic with other emigre organizations such as Alpha 66.
They issued a "war communique" saying Cuban civilian
airliners would be attacked. Later that year a Cubana
airliner, en route from Venezuela to Havana, blew up in
mid-air shortly after a takeoff in Barbados; 73 civilians
died, including all of Cuba's Olympic fencing team.
   Venezuela arrested Bosch and three others and charged them
with the bombing. Bosch and two others were convicted then
subsequently acquitted on appeal, but nonetheless held in
prison. The other accused, Luis Posada Carriles, had escaped.
In view of the Bush administration's later clemency toward
Bosch, we should note that during the Iran-Contra scandal,
Posada surfaced in the Ilopango base in El Salvador, working
alongside President Bush's old CIA buddy Felix Rodriguez in
funneling illegal arms shipments to the Nicaraguan Contras.
Mr. Bush was CIA director at the time Bosch and his confreres
were hatching terror schemes in the Dominican Republic.
   On his release from a Venezuelan prison in 1987, Bosch
announced he was ready to "rejoin the struggle" and,
regarding the Cubana bombing, that "all of Castro's airplanes
are warplanes." In 1988 he was released and returned to the
U.S., where he was arrested as a parole violator. Cuba
applied to have him deported to face proceedings, but the
application was denied on the grounds that Bosch would not
get a fair trial. In rejecting Bosch's request for political
asylum in January 1989, the acting associate attorney general
wrote that "For 30 years Bosch has been resolute and
unwavering in his advocacy of terrorist violence. . . . He
has repeatedly expressed and demonstrated a willingness to
cause indiscriminate injury and death."
   In July, after a campaign by Cuban emigres in Miami in
which President Bush's son Jeb expressed his support, Bosch
was granted parole.
   Joe Doherty was imprisoned on June 18, 1983, for having
entered the U.S. illegally. The British government sought his
extradition on charges arising from the shooting death of a
member of the S.A.S., the British commando unit. In 1984,
federal district Judge John Sprizzo held that Doherty could
not be extradited under the then-existing treaty and,
addressing himself explicitly to the death of the S.A.S. man,
said that "The death of Captain Westmacott, while a most
tragic event, occurred in the context of an attempted ambush
of a British army patrol. It was the British response to that
action that gave rise to Captain Westmacott's death. Had this
conduct occurred during the course of more traditional
military hostilities there could be little doubt that it
would fall within the political offense exception."
   Though the history of Joe Doherty's legal battles is long,
it is also simple. He has prevailed repeatedly in court
battles and in Board of Immigration Appeal hearings. Under
U.S. law he merits asylum, and should not be deported to the
U.K., where he would not have the certainty of a fair trial.
The force of this latter point was of course much enhanced
last year by the revelations of perversions of justice in the
case of the "Guilford Four," released after many years in
prison when a panel of British judges ruled their convictions
were not "safe." Nonetheless, Attorney Generals Edwin Meese
and now Richard Thornburgh have repeatedly controverted both
federal courts and Board of Immigration Appeals decisions,
and ordered Doherty's deportation, thus seeking to circumvent
the law on asylum. As Rep. Henry J. Hyde wrote to Mr.
Thornburgh in May: "I believe the handling of this case
involves an indefensible violation of the spirit, if not the
letter, of the basic guarantees of equal justice and due
processes of law. . . . The United States has never, ever,
handled an extradition or deportation case the way it has
handled this one."
   On June 29, a federal appeals court panel granted Doherty
the right to apply for asylum here, thus handing the Justice
Department yet another setback. The judges concluded that Mr.
Thornburgh's reversal of his own INS Appeals Board decision
had been improperly influenced by geopolitical and
foreign-policy considerations. Though ample sureties have
been offered, Doherty's lawyer, Mary Pike, received her copy
of the Justice Department's letter to a New York judge urging
denial of bail to Doherty on the same day Orlando Bosch was
released.
   So Doherty can't get bail, even though he manifestly
doesn't want to flee, given that he is litigating his ability
to stay in the U.S. Bosch got 10 years for bombing a Polish
vessel and for conveying by telegraph threats to the
president of Mexico and Prime Minister Harold Wilson. He
violated parole and became a fugitive under U.S. law. Despite
this, Bosch is released and Doherty held in his cell. The
Irishman should hispanicize his name, make more influential
friends in Miami and start threatening Fidel Castro. This is
the essential extrajudicial factor he has overlooked.

   Gerber Products Co., citing strong sales of baby food,
said earnings for its first quarter rose 17% to $31.3
million, or 83 cents a share.
   The Fremont, Mich., baby-food concern said successful
promotions and increased distribution in the quarter
contributed to a volume increase of 6%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the year-earlier quarter, Gerber earned $26.8 million,
or 70 cents a share. Sales for the latest quarter, ended June
30, rose 12% to $295.9 million from $263.9 million.
   The company said that while it is pleased with these
results, "there are indications that some of this increase
may have resulted from advance buying by our customers."
   Consequently, Gerber said, volume for its second quarter
is expected to be flat with the year-earlier period. But for
the full year, it said volume gains are expected to be "in
excess of those projected for the industry."

   Pacific Telesis and CCI Agree to Merge
   Cellular Operations in Ohio, Michigan

   Pacific Telesis Group and Cellular Communications Inc.
announced plans to merge their Ohio and Michigan cellular
operations in a transaction that ultimately would give
Pacific Telesis the right to buy a pared-down CCI.
   The agreement, which sets up a multistep process, marks
further consolidation of the cellular telephone market.
Initially, San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis will buy 5% of
CCI's stock at $39 a share, for a total of about $87 million.
The companies will merge their cellular operations, forming
one of the nation's largest regional systems. The
27,000-square-mile territory, which has a population of
nearly 15 million, includes Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus,
Dayton, Detroit and Toledo.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's a good long-term strategic fit for Pacific Telesis,"
said Joel Gross, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette. "With the current consolidation, it is inevitable
that phone companies will be buyers, in part because cellular
poses a threat to their local copper-wire networks."
   PacTel Cellular, Pacific Telesis's cellular telephone
unit, currently operates in the Detroit-Toledo area under the
Cellular One name. CCI also operates under the Cellular One
name in Ohio.
   The agreement calls for New York-based CCI to spin off to
shareholders two businesses, its international operations and
long-distance business, before closing the transaction.
Afterward, CCI will spin off to shareholders a third public
company containing its cellular operations in Puerto Rico.
The companies said they expect the closing to take place in
the second or third quarters of 1991 after approval from
shareholders and regulators.
   In the first 4 1/2 years after the closing, Pacific
Telesis can buy up to 27.5% of CCI stock through open market
purchases and privately negotiated sales. After that period,
the regional Bell telephone company has agreed to buy 10.04
million shares at $60 each, or a total of about $600 million,
for 22.5% of CCI.
   Pacific Telesis can buy the remaining shares 5 1/2 years
to eight years after the closing, and the price would be
based on investment bankers' appraisals of CCI's interest in
the joint venture. The series of options and the appraisal
process make it difficult to put a price tag on the total
transaction, but CCI is generally valued at about $1.5
billion and the joint venture's value is expected to double
that.
   CCI Chairman George Blumenthal said the combination of the
Ohio and Michigan regions puts the joint venture in a strong
position to win much more than 50% of the market. "It gives
us the ability to craft special services and market to
clients with multiple branch offices," he said. CCI studies
have shown that "roaming" and long-distance calls generally
are within 200 miles, with many of the calls into the Detroit
market. Mr. Blumenthal also said that the joint venture will
consider acquiring cellular systems in areas adjoining the
joint venture's territory.
   Lee Cox, president of PacTel Corp., the holding company
for Pacific Telesis's unregulated businesses, said that "one
of the earliest benefits will be the ability to market
together to some of our largest customers."
   Investors, however, weren't so optimistic. CCI shares fell
$2.25 a share in national over-the-counter trading yesterday
to close at $33 a share. On the Big Board, Pacific Telesis
shares slipped 25 cents each to $41.50.
   Barclay Knapp, CCI's chief operating officer, was chosen
as chief executive of the joint venture, which will be
directed by a four-person partnership committee. Both
companies will appoint two members.

   New Therapy May Block Leading Cause
   Of Chronic Kidney Failure, Study Says
   ----

   Researchers say they may have found a way to prevent
kidney inflammations, the leading cause of chronic kidney
failure.
   The therapy would be the first to block the scarring
involved in the inflammations, which will cause 35,000 of the
more than 170,000 new cases of kidney failure in the U.S.
this year. Chronic kidney failure, which usually forces
patients to undergo costly dialysis, is rising at an 8% to 9%
rate each year, according to the National Institutes of
Health.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a study published in today's issue of the British
journal Nature, scientists at the La Jolla Cancer Research
Foundation and at the University of Utah School of Medicine
found that the inflammations are tied to the increased
production in the kidneys of a protein called Transforming
Growth Factor-Beta. They then discovered an antibody that
appears to neutralize the activity of the growth factor and
block the formation of scar tissue in the kidneys' filtration
units, which remove waste products and excess fluid from the
body.
   But some researchers seem less convinced that the findings
will prevent the scarring that clogs the kidneys. "I'm
skeptical that this is the only factor causing the
progression of kidney disease," says Lawrence Agodoa,
director of clinical studies for the kidney division of NIH.
He says other growth factors could be involved. "We aren't
near any kind of human application," he says, noting that the
experiments have been conducted only on rats.
   Dr. Agodoa says others have tied high blood pressure, high
cholesterol levels and high-protein diets to the progression
of kidney scarring, and a cure may involve these factors as
well. NIH is currently involved in a multimillion-dollar,
four-year study that's trying to determine the role of diet
in the progression of kidney failure.
   Nonetheless, "this is a window of opportunity to develop a
therapy for kidney disease," which is caused by diabetes and
high blood pressure, among other things, says Wayne A.
Border, an author of the study who is a professor and chief
of the division of nephrology at the University of Utah
School of Medicine.
   Rights to the findings have been acquired by Telios
Pharmaceuticals Inc., a closely held La Jolla, Calif., drug
concern that is 25%-owned by the La Jolla Cancer Research
Foundation. Telios said it plans to develop and market drugs
based on the discovery in five to seven years.
   So far, doctors have only been able to use steroids and
immunosuppressive drugs to treat diseases that initially
cause inflammation and injury to the kidneys, such as Lupus
and certain infections. The problem is that "the treatments
aren't that effective," says Arthur Cohen, a professor of
pathology and medicine at University of California, Los
Angeles.
   Even if they halt the disease that initially produces
damage to the kidneys, the organs often continue to
degenerate for unexplained reasons. "Once the destructive
process begins, we cannot stop it," says Dr. Cohen. Doctors
are only able to prescribe ways to reduce blood pressure and
protein in a patient's diet, which appear to slow the
destruction of the kidneys.
   While the current study doesn't show that the antibodies
used destroy existing scars, it does show that they prevent
scarring from occuring. Dr. Border says that the preventive
finding could be used to spare thousands from dialysis or
from transplants.
   It could help some of the 15,000 patients now awaiting
transplants, only half of whom will receive one, Dr. Border
says. Or it may assist some of the 80,000 people who die of
kidney and urinary tract diseases each year, according to the
National Kidney Foundation. It could also aid one of every
five diabetics who now develop kidney failure. And it may
reduce medical costs. Because of the high price of dialysis
and transplants, the cost of kidney and urologic diseases in
1990 is expected to exceed $50 billion, more than $3 billion
of which will come from taxpayers' pockets.
   The researchers say they have begun trying to replicate
the results in humans, and expect final results in six
months. So far, says Erkki Ruoslahti, president of the
foundation, results are encouraging.
   They also say the findings have potential for the
development of treatments for such disorders as liver
cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis and cancer. "There are similar
diseases that affect the lungs or the liver, with excessive
scar formation. We suspect that those diseases could be
treated the same way," says Dr. Ruoslahti.

   DETROIT -- Combined profits at General Motors Corp.'s
finance and technology subsidiaries were virtually flat in
the second quarter, as a 25% decline in earnings at the GM
Hughes Electronics unit offset gains in data processing and
finance operations.
   GM's Electronic Data Systems Corp., General Motors
Acceptance Corp. and GM Hughes units had combined earnings of
$579.6 million in the quarter, up 0.5% from $577 million a
year before. GM is scheduled to release earnings for the
remainder of its operations today.

   GM Hughes, which includes the defense technology
operations of Hughes Aircraft Co. and the automotive
electronics businesses of Delco Electronics Corp., saw net
income in the quarter fall to $152.3 million from $203.1
million a year earlier. The decline came despite record
second quarter revenue of $2.99 billion, up from $2.88
billion a year ago. GM Hughes blamed the decline on increased
spending for new products at Hughes, the impact of GM vehicle
production cuts on Delco, and higher taxes.
   GM's Class H stock, which represents a dividend interest
in Hughes earnings, closed yesterday at $18.875, down 12.5
cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   At EDS, second quarter net income rose 19% to $125.3
million from $104.9 million. Revenue rose 5.7% to $1.46
billion. GM business accounted for 55% of EDS's total revenue
in the latest quarter. "We anticipate having a very good
year," EDS chairman Les Alberthal said in a statement. GM
Class E stock, which represents a dividend interest in EDS
earnings, closed yesterday at $33.75, down 50 cents in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   GMAC, the auto maker's finance arm, said lower borrowing
costs helped boost second quarter net income by 12% to $302
million from $269 million a year ago. However, GMAC said the
number of new vehicles it financed in the U.S. during the
latest quarter fell 24% to 541,000 cars and trucks. Outside
the U.S., GMAC financed 9.9% fewer new vehicles than a year
ago.
   For the first half of the year, net income at GM Hughes
fell 21% to $297.9 million from $376 million a year ago.
Revenue eased to $5.85 billion from $5.89 billion.
   EDS's first-half profit rose 14.7% to $235.1 million from
$204.9 million. Revenue was up 7.8% to $2.87 billion from
$2.66 billion.
   GMAC's first-half earnings rose 2% to $638 million from
$625 million.

   Leave-Bill Veto
   By Bush Sustained
   232-195 in House

   WASHINGTON -- The House, as expected, failed to override
President Bush's veto of legislation guaranteeing workers as
much as 12 weeks annual unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption
or serious family illness.
   The vote, 232-195 in favor of the bill, fell 53 votes
short of the two-thirds required to override a veto.
President Bush, in vetoing the bill earlier this month,
criticized its "rigid, federal-imposed requirements" and said
employers need flexibility in offering benefits to workers.
Yesterday's vote leaves Mr. Bush's veto record unblemished;
Congress has sustained 13 of the president's vetoes,
overriding none.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After the vote, Democrats served notice they would be back
before Congress with the measure. "George Bush is going to
have a family-leave bill on his desk every year," said Sen.
Christopher Dodd, (D., Conn.), who led the fight in the
Senate for the legislation. He and Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.,
Mass.) said they would soon reintroduce the legislation.
   Though the vote was a victory for the White House and
business groups, Democrats are expected to seize on it as a
political issue in the November elections. Mr. Bush pledged
in his 1988 presidential campaign to protect women's jobs,
though he has opposed mandating benefits.
   The veto "makes an absolute mockery out of this president
suggesting that he is pro-family," charged Rep. George Miller
(D., Calif.).
   Opponents of the legislation believe such benefits should
be offered voluntarily, without the government mandating what
companies must offer. Business groups have raised concerns
over the cost of finding and training replacement workers and
covering health insurance for employees on leave. They say it
would reduce existing benefits and favor only high-paid
employees who can better afford to take off from work.
Sponsors of the legislation estimated it would cost business
$236 million annually.
   Rep. Steve Bartlett (R., Texas) called the legislation "a
cruel hoax which would mandate one-benefit-fits-all." He said
those who voted against the bill support "parental leave as a
benefit, but we are for choices by American workers, not
choices made for them by politicians."
   Some Republicans opposed the president's veto. A vote to
sustain the veto is "literally saying to a pregnant woman or
the mother of a terminally ill child or someone caring for an
elderly parent. . . go find another job," said Rep. Marge
Roukema, (R., N.J.), who was one of 37 Republicans voting
with Democrats to override the veto.
   The House passed the bill by a 237-187 margin in May.
   Proponents say the legislation is a necessity in a nation
where many working parents are caught between the demands of
work and raising a family. Employers would be required to
guarantee jobs and provide health benefits during the
worker's absence. Companies with fewer than 50 employees
wouldn't be covered by the measure, exempting about 44% of
employees nationally.
   Mr. Kennedy recalled the time he took off from work when
his son required cancer treatment. "Every three weeks I was
gone three days from the U.S. Senate," he said, adding that
many other parents don't have the flexibility to take time
off without fear of losing their jobs.

   Trump to Ask
   His Bondholders
   For Debt Relief

   Proposal Now Includes Swap
   Of Equity for Canceling
   Some Interest Payments

<LP>
   A month after he staved off financial ruin by getting his
bankers to lend him $65 million, Donald Trump is about to ask
his casino bondholders for a similar financial favor.
   Mr. Trump and his advisers have tentatively decided to
propose to holders of all or part of the $1.3 billion in debt
to accept equity in his casinos in exchange for letting him
cancel some interest payments, people close to the situation
say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If bondholders approve the proposal, they would receive
stock in a Trump entity that would be traded, making it
possible for the public to own a piece of Donald Trump. Mr.
Trump has retained Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to explore this and
other options in Atlantic City, N.J., those people close to
the situation say.
   What ails Mr. Trump's casinos is the same thing that
forced him to restructure some $2 billion of bank debt last
month: His properties are not earning enough cash to pay the
interest on their debt. Within the next year, Securities and
Exchange Commission documents show, Mr. Trump will have to
come up with about $210 million in interest and principal
payments. The next payment is $47 million in interest due Taj
Mahal bondholders Nov. 15. Analysts say that based on the
casinos' performances in the busy summer months, it is
unlikely that Mr. Trump will be able to raise the money
needed.
   Figures obtained by this newspaper indicate the new Trump
Taj Mahal had a pretax operating loss this past quarter of
about $15 million. That figure doesn't include about $75
million owed contractors on the project, nor does it account
for an estimated $30 million still needed to finish the
facility. The operating loss also doesn't include pre-opening
expenses that were deferred in the Taj Mahal's SEC filing for
the first quarter.
   Results at Mr. Trump's other two casinos, Trump Plaza and
Trump's Castle, also are expected to be down from last year's
already weak levels. The second-quarter figures are required
to be filed with the SEC by mid-August.
   In June, Mr. Trump narrowly escaped defaulting on payments
to Trump's Castle bondholders when banks agreed to lend him
$20 million with a commitment for $45 million more. That
agreement followed weeks of marathon negotiations with about
90 banks that had lent Mr. Trump money, often on the strength
of no more than his personal guarantee.
   Mr. Trump declined to comment on plans for his casinos.
But in a telephone interview he said he remains confident in
the strength of his company. "I think the banks are extremely
impressed with what they've seen {of the Trump
Organization}," he said. "This is a great company, it will be
around a long time."
   He complained that too much attention was being paid to
his recent troubles. "They {the media} don't write about any
other company but me," he said. "I haven't missed a payment."
   Some people who work for Mr. Trump see the casinos' poor
performance as a sign that Mr. Trump's marital and financial
troubles are taking a toll on his image.
   "Caesars has positioned itself as the high-roller house,
the Claridge is supposed to be the gambler's casino, Harrah's
has the drive-in families, and Donald has always had the
glamour," said one individual familiar with Mr. Trump's
operations. "And it's tough to be glamorous when you're
restructuring."
   Mr. Trump said the casinos are not performing up to par
because the entire Northeast U.S. economy is suffering. He
said his competitors' results are also down from a year ago.
   But with the highly public bank restructuring behind him,
Mr. Trump's margin for error is thinner than his
competitors'. Unlike the banks, the casino bondholders hold
first mortgages on all his properties. That means that if he
defaults, the bondholders could end up owning the casinos.
That fact could give the bondholders less incentive to
compromise.
   But Mr. Trump said bondholders would benefit little in the
short run if they forced him to default. "If the bondholders
ever did that, they'd be in court for years," he says. And,
Mr. Trump emphasized, he is still current on his bond
payments.
   Mark Brostowski, a casino analyst with Salomon Brothers
who issued a negative report on Mr. Trump's bonds in January,
said it is clear from current revenue that it would be
difficult for Mr. Trump to make all of his bond payments over
the next 12 months. But in a restructuring, Mr. Brostowski
said, it also would be tough for Mr. Trump to convince
bondholders to sacrifice a great deal unless he is willing to
relinquish major chunks of his equity.
   "It will all depend on what he offers them," Mr.
Brostowski said. "The bondholders will want to extract some
pain from Donald."
   So far, bondholders haven't been formally contacted by the
Trump Organization, though New Jersey gambling officials have
been apprised of Mr. Trump's plans. Nevertheless, an exchange
offer probably wouldn't come as a surprise to wary owners of
the bonds, who have seen the Taj bonds trade for as low as 43
cents on the dollar. Traders quoted the bonds yesterday at 46
cents, down 2.25 cents.
   An examination of the Taj's numbers indicate that the
facility, which opened to great fanfare in April, took in
about $1.2 million a day in casino revenue through the end of
June. That's a record for an Atlantic City casino, but falls
short of the $1.3 million a day some analysts said the casino
would need to break even. This month, the Taj is on a pace to
earn over $40 million, which Mr. Trump said would be a record
month for any casino. Traditionally, the summer months are
the strongest for Atlantic City casinos.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Trump said he is still negotiating with the
unpaid contractors to accept partial payment for their work.
He dismissed a question about when he would complete the
casino's pool, sauna, theater and restaurants. "Nothing in
life is finished," he said.

   Women's Magazines Lose Some Charm

   NEW YORK -- Yesterday morning at 10:30, S.I. Newhouse,
chairman of Conde Nast Publications Inc., stood in front of
the staff of Woman magazine and delivered news it had feared
but expected: The magazine was closing.
   Meanwhile, across town, the U.S. unit of French publisher
Hachette S.A. announced it was giving up its attempt to
auction off Woman's Day, the mass-circulation magazine it put
up for sale in May. With advertising pages and circulation
falling off sharply, the bids from interested buyers
apparently came in well below the $200 million the French
were seeking.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Almost every consumer magazine is fighting its way through
a persistent advertising slump. But the folding of Woman and
the failure to sell Woman's Day indicate that the perennially
strong category of women's magazines is showing troubling,
long-term weakness. In the case of both magazines, the
publishers said even though there were interested buyers,
bankers were skittish about financing magazine acquisitions
in the uncertain climate.
   "This is a tough business environment and getting
tougher," says Patricia Donnelly, vice president at Young &amp;
Rubicam, who specializes in packaged goods clients, major
advertisers in women's magazines. "I would expect more
women's magazines to be faced with folding."
   Both Woman and Woman's Day, like most magazines in the
category, have been hit by large declines in cigarette
advertising dollars and plummeting single-copy sales at
supermarket checkout stands and convenience stores. Tobacco
companies are traditionally heavy advertisers in women's
magazines, and women's magazines are the largest sellers at
checkouts.
   But publishers learned the bad news last week that tobacco
company ad spending in consumer magazines has fallen 27% from
1989. And, according to Audit Bureau of Circulations figures,
total magazine circulation at newsstands and checkouts fell
14% between 1982 and 1989. Agency executives expect
single-copy sales will fall further in 1990.
   The trouble in women's magazines is stretching across
several categories. Conde Nast's Vogue lost 10% of its ad
pages in the first half of 1990 because of tumult in the
retail and fashion industries, and ad pages at New York Times
Co.'s McCall's fell 13% as packaged goods companies slashed
their budgets. A couple of magazines continue to show
strength, including Hearst Corp.'s Good Housekeeping, where
ad pages rose 7% in the first half, and its Redbook, up 2%.
Some start-ups, such as News Corp.'s Mirabella and Hearst's
Victoria, are growing.
   For Conde Nast, the failure of Woman is a major
disappointment. Mr. Newhouse bought the magazine in late 1988
for about $13 million to build strength at checkout counters,
where Woman sold 500,000 copies. But Woman was also an
attempt to reach beyond Conde Nast's usual upscale, affluent
audience to an older, more middle-of-the-road readership. The
average Woman reader was 35 years old, with a household
income of about $27,000.
   In the first half, Woman's ad pages dropped 16%. According
to the most current circulation figures, newsstand and
checkout-counter sales dropped 14% in the 1989 second half
from a year earlier, with total circulation dropping 3.2% to
502,397. Staff members said the magazine had a loss of $8
million in 1989 and was expected to lose a similar amount
this year.
   Conde Nast said it would try to hire as many Woman staff
members as possible. But Editor Pat Miller and Publisher
Rebecca Darwin haven't been offered new positions and will be
leaving the company.
   The 53-year-old Woman's Day, meanwhile, remains
profitable, though its earnings are expected to decline
sharply this year. According to a publishing executive who
says he looked at Woman's Day's prospectus, Hachette
estimated the magazine's operating profit would fall to $15.9
million in 1990 from $25 million in 1989. Hachette says that
the $15.9 million figure is "not correct" and that earnings
will be higher but declines to be specific.
   Hachette acquired Woman's Day as part of its 1988 purchase
of Peter Diamandis's Diamandis Communications Inc., now the
U.S. magazine subsidiary of Hachette. Mr. Diamandis, who was
reluctant to put the magazine up for sale in the first place,
says that the bids "did not reflect the true worth" of
Woman's Day. Daniel Filipacchi, vice chairman of Hachette,
says that the company will now turn to "investing its
considerable resources" in the magazine.
   "We were able to find bidders, but the bidders were unable
to get bankers to go along with the price they wanted to
pay," Didier Guerin, president of Hachette Publications Inc.,
says. "Bankers don't want to lend the money the way they did
a year or two ago. They are more cautious."
   Mr. Guerin says Hachette wanted to sell Woman's Day to
reduce the debt from its $712 million purchase of Diamandis.
But he adds: "Hachette doesn't have a debt problem. We are
able to meet all our obligations." Despite speculation that
Memories, another Diamandis magazine, would be put up for
sale, Mr. Guerin says no other magazines will be offered for
sale at this time.

   WASHINGTON -- Sen. Arlen Specter asked the Internal
Revenue Service to begin an inquiry into possible violations
of U.S. anti-boycott laws by Baxter International Inc.
   In a letter to IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg last
week, the Pennsylvania Republican raised questions about
whether Baxter had cooperated illegally with the Arab boycott
of Israel or failed to provide required information on tax
forms about any Arab requests for participation in the
boycott. A spokesman for the IRS, which is required under the
Internal Revenue Code to help monitor companies' compliance
with U.S. anti-boycott law, declined to comment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A separate investigation by the Commerce Department into
Baxter's Middle Eastern activities is continuing, as is an
informal inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission
into whether Baxter may have violated anti-bribery laws in
the Middle East.
   Meanwhile, an independent inquiry by the audit committee
of Baxter's board is expected to be completed by the end of
the year. "About the only thing I can tell you is that (the
investigation) is ongoing," Stephen N. Shulman, a New York
lawyer from the firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft who is
conducting the committee's inquiry, said in an interview. "I
am trying to touch everything that might be relevant."
   Investigators are looking into Baxter's removal in 1989
from the Arab League's blacklist of corporations that do
business with Israel. Specifically, the government is trying
to determine whether Baxter's 1988 sale of an Israeli
subsidiary was related to any violation of U.S. anti-boycott
law or whether Baxter made any improper payments to win
removal from the blacklist. Jewish groups, including the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and the American
Jewish Congress, have raised questions about the sale.
   Baxter has repeatedly and vigorously denied any wrongdoing
in connection with its removal from the blacklist. The
hospital supplier cites a recent joint venture with the
Syrian government to build an intravenous-fluids plant in
Syria as the apparent reason for its being taken off the
list.
   Officials of Premier Hospitals Alliance Inc., a nationwide
cooperative of 45 teaching and research hospitals based in
Westchester, Ill., met last month with Baxter representatives
at the company's Deerfield, Ill., headquarters in connection
with questions about Baxter's Middle Eastern activities,
which were first reported in an article in The Wall Street
Journal May 1.
   "We are doing as we would in any case where a business
partner is being investigated for illegal activities," said a
spokeswoman for Premier, which handles group purchasing,
among other things, for its members. Premier is conducting
its own inquiry and awaiting the outcome of the government
investigations before making any decisions on the matter, the
spokeswoman said.

   Separately, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
asked Sandoz to change the labeling on the drug to make it
clear that the regulatory agency doesn't require that the
blood test at issue be sold with the drug.
   The action reflects continuing controversy over the drug,
known under the brand name Clozaril. The first new
antipsychotic compound in 20 years, Clozaril costs $8,944 a
year combined with Sandoz's proprietary monitoring system.
Last week, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it broke
off talks with Sandoz aimed at reducing the cost of the drug.
Talks have resumed, but the agency currently won't provide
Clozaril to about 3,600 veterans considered candidates for
the medicine.
   At least eight states, including California, Minnesota,
New York and Michigan, are understood to have antitrust
inquiries under way, though none has filed suit. Sandoz
officials say they considered antitrust issues before
deciding to market the drug with the monitoring system and
believe they are on solid legal ground.
   The drug, known generically as clozapine, has proved
effective in treating some schizophrenic patients who haven't
been helped by other medications. In clinical trials, some
patients previously confined for years in mental hospitals
have progressed to near normal lives. But in less than 2% of
patients, the medicine can trigger a potentially fatal side
effect. Without careful monitoring, Sandoz says, patients
will die and the drug will be pulled from the market.
   The drug and the monitoring system, which includes a
weekly white blood count, is dispensed by the Caremark
Homecare unit of Baxter International Inc., Deerfield Ill.
Patients can't get a weekly supply of the drug without having
a blood test. Sandoz, the U.S. unit of Sandoz Ltd., the Swiss
drug concern, says the proprietary system has proved 99.6%
effective in monitoring patients.
   The Department of Veterans Affairs, several states and
some hospitals have said they can provide their own
monitoring system at far less cost. Sandoz has considered the
VA's proposal in particular, but thus far has refused to
sanction any other monitoring system.
   Meanwhile, the FDA has come under fire for approving
Sandoz's labeling for the drug, which describes the
monitoring system as the Clozaril Patient Management System,
giving the impression, critics say, that the agency requires
the proprietary system.
   In a letter to Sandoz dated July 13, the FDA asked for
labeling changes to describe the monitoring system in more
general terms stating that the drug is available "only
through distribution systems that ensure weekly (white blood
count) testing" as a condition of receiving a week's supply
of medicine.
   Sandoz said it would like to discuss the requested changes
with the FDA. But the company doesn't want to be liable for a
monitoring system it doesn't control and said the requested
labeling changes don't resolve that concern.

   Your June 11 page-one article "Blow to Brokers" presents a
skewed view of the status of customer-broker arbitrations.
   The notion that securities firms suddenly have become
concerned with the prospect that the arbitration system may
threaten their financial well-being is as absurd as it is
ironic. After pursuing a single-minded effort to deny
customers access to the courts, the securities industry
apparently has undertaken to establish that customers now
have the upper hand. To emphasize this, you cite "a surge in
punitive-damage awards," noting that punitive-damage awards
were handed down in 21 instances since May 1989. You fail,
however, to mention that this represents about one-third of
1% of the 6,101 arbitration cases that the article notes were
filed in 1988. Somehow it is difficult to believe that these
results have caused Wall Street brokers to quake before their
computers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The fact is that the awarding of punitive damages is still
unusual. But customers in some states (such as Georgia,
Florida and Arizona) are far more likely to recover punitive
damages than those in other states (such as New York, where
the largest number of claims are filed).
   As long as customers do not receive uniform treatment
regardless of their state of residence, the system has
failed.
   Even where customers are successful, most arbitration
awards do not cover the full amount of their losses.

   Thrifts Post Losses
   Of $271 Million
   For First Quarter

   WASHINGTON -- The nation's thrifts posted losses of $271
million in the first quarter of 1990, savings and loan
regulators said, in their best quarter since they reported a
small profit a year earlier.
   But some analysts say the results are misleading. They
don't include losses at 350 insolvent S&amp;Ls under government
management waiting to be sold; these results will be reported
later. And the figures do include $1.9 billion of government
assistance pumped into 202 thrifts, resulting from lucrative
deals struck in 1988 and before, officials said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   About $1.5 billion in the assistance went to the buyers,
including the Robert Bass Group and New York financier Ronald
Perelman, as payment for managing the bad investments that
came with the sick S&amp;Ls. Another $400 million was paid in
interest on nontaxable notes that went to the buyers to make
up for the losses that the S&amp;Ls dragged with them into the
deal, said Mary Creeden, an official of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   Those transactions, which also provided billions of
dollars in tax breaks for holding companies of the S&amp;Ls, are
being examined by the regulators looking for ways to slash
the costs of the deals to the taxpayer. For example, the
high-interest notes might be paid off with cash. The studies
are expected to be completed soon.
   Some industry analysts say the government assistance
distorts the health of the S&amp;Ls, and that those sold in 1988
wouldn't be profitable without the assistance. "The
incentives they created were all wrong," asserts Roger
Kormendi, professor of finance at the University of Michigan,
who studied the transactions for the government a year ago.
"They have guarantees regardless of performance."
   Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said he was mildly encouraged that losses have
ebbed for the three-quarters of the industry that isn't
queued up to be sold. "Should we jump up and down and declare
victory?" he mused. "No. This is still a very, very tough
situation in my view."
   In the 1989 first quarter, the private-sector thrifts
earned $10 million. The number of thrifts fell to 2,505 in
the 1990 first quarter from 2,761 a year earlier.
   Mr. Ryan attributed the earnings improvement to the
seizure of 84 sick S&amp;Ls in the first quarter, which
effectively removed them as competitors for deposits.
   With S&amp;Ls being shuffled among government agencies
according to their health, the thrift regulators appeared as
confused as the taxpayers as to who will pay $130 billion --
or $500 billion with interest -- over the next 40 years for
the S&amp;L cleanup. The first-quarter results were delayed by
weeks, and the thrift office now reports deposit inflows and
outflows quarterly instead of monthly, despite protests from
analysts who rely on the data.
   Also, this was the first time the results didn't include
the insolvent S&amp;Ls seized by the Resolution Trust Corp. for
later sale. Their losses, which would have dragged the other
part of the industry even further into the red, will be
reported separately in a few weeks.
   Mr. Ryan, who has held his post for four months now,
acknowledged that the office was disorganized, but attributed
it to a new data-collection system and said the agency wasn't
trying to stem bad news. In the past, thrift regulators have
vastly underestimated the size of the S&amp;L losses, which
delayed the cleanup. "I am not going to be Mr. Rosy
Scenario," he said.

   As I write this (June 24), the death toll from the
earthquake in Iran has exceeded 40,000. And while we all must
give our full support to the relief efforts, we should note
that 40,000 is also the number of children in the world who
die every day from chronic malnutrition and preventable
disease. The earthquake in Iran is apparently the first since
1976 (the eighth in this century) to equal or exceed the
24-hour death toll of children in our world from malnutrition
and disease.
   The generous outpouring of media coverage and monetary
gifts directed to the victims in Iran is testimony to a
heartening new level of public compassion and concern. Yet
our concern is awakened only for sudden emergencies in
limited geographic areas. We have not yet fully awakened to
the unparalleled tragedy of malnutrition and disease, nor
have we recognized the low-cost opportunities to cut in half
the resulting death toll of 40,000 a day.

   On Sept. 29 and 30, the World Summit for Children will

potential of the summit is to save the lives of 50 million

citizens will voice their support for the summit in 180
candlelight vigils in 16 countries. All who wish to
participate should call 1-800-WE AGREE.

   Belief That Japan Won't Raise Rates
   In Near Future Helps Push Yen Down

   NEW YORK -- A growing belief that Japan's central bank
won't raise interest rates in the near future helped push the
yen down against the dollar and the mark.
   The dollar flitted above 150 yen several times around
midafternoon in New York and was quoted late in the day at
149.89 yen, up from 148.78 yen the day before. The dollar
also was trading at 1.6250 marks, up from 1.6215 marks late
Tuesday. Sterling stood at $1.8117, down from $1.8133 late
Tuesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading at 150 yen soon
after the opening; in Tokyo Wednesday it closed at 149.13
yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6263
marks, up from the Tokyo close of 1.6241 marks on Wednesday.
   The dollar hasn't closed above 150 yen since July 5.
   The yen's slide also sent the mark up past the 92-yen
level, a threshold that triggered customers' orders to sell
yen to avoid further losses, traders said. The yen was quoted
late in the day at 92.24 yen, compared with 91.76 yen late
Tuesday in New York.
   Two waves of activity dominated New York trading, dealers
said. One centered on the dollar, as markets reacted quickly
to comments by Federal Reserve Board Governor Wayne Angell in
a Boston speech that he opposes any easing of U.S. monetary
policy at this time. The dollar -- which has been drifting
amid conflicting signals on U.S. rates since Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan referred to a marginal easing of rates two
weeks ago in congressional testimony -- was pushed upward as
traders jumped to buy the currency.
   The Angell comment came as a surprise, said Alexis Egan,
corporate foreign exchange trader at Banque Indosuez in New
York. It was a "comment no one expected from a place no one
expected," she said, and it caused a surge that helped
trigger sell orders against the Japanese currency as the
dollar approached 150 yen.
   But the dollar was on the sidelines for much of the day as
attention was focused on the yen's slide against other
currencies, especially the mark. "Basically, today is a cross
(or non-dollar rates) day and not a dollar day," Kenny
Kimura, an assistant vice president and trader at Sumitomo
Bank in New York, said.
   Mr. Kimura said the yen's slide against the mark in Asian
and European trading was unexpected and triggered sell
orders. He and others cited a growing view among traders that
Japan's central bank won't boost rates soon. Speculation that
Japanese rates would rise had helped boost the yen in recent
weeks.
   Shigeito Yanase, a foreign exchange manager with Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank in Tokyo, echoed other traders when he said the
Bank of Japan may wait until late August or early September
to raise rates.
   Ronald Holzer, vice president and chief dealer at Harris
Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago, said attention in the market
now will focus on the first estimate of U.S. second-quarter
gross national product, due for release tomorrow.
   "I think the market is poised fundamentally to lower the
dollar," he said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery jumped $4.10 to settle at $372 an ounce. Estimated
volume was a heavy seven million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Thursday, gold opened for trading at $371.35
an ounce.

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said second-quarter profit
slipped 2.8% from a year earlier, with all the company's
business segments showing declines except its energy
operations.
   The chemical and energy concern posted profit of $694
million, or $1.02 a share, which was in line with analysts'
expectations. In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned
$714 million, or $1 a share. The higher per-share profit in
the latest quarter is due to fewer shares outstanding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales in the latest quarter rose 4% to $9.65 billion from
$9.28 billion.
   Du Pont attributed the drop in profit to weaknesses in the
U.S. economy, where unit volume sales decreased 5%. Outside
the U.S., unit sales rose 6%, almost entirely from gains in
Europe.
   "This lends support to a key goal of expansion in Europe
to double business by the mid-1990s," Du Pont Chairman Edgar
S. Woolard Jr. said in a statement.
   In the latest quarter, the sharpest drop came in
industrial products, where after-tax operating profit fell
15% to $135 million.

   Your June 6 page-one article on the costly rivalry between
Borgess Medical Center and Bronson Methodist Hospital in
Kalamazoo, Mich., demonstrates a sad decline in the
responsiveness of some of our most cherished institutions to
the communities they purport to serve. Kalamazoo's situation
is not unique. But let's not forget the role we all have in
subsidizing the internecine behavior.
   If the Kalamazoo businesses truly are fed up with their
hospitals' costly habits, they can encourage their employees
to drive 45 miles north to Grand Rapids in order to enjoy
tremendous savings and top-quality care. This would reward
more-efficient providers with the best prize of all-patient
volume. If the Kalamazoo businesses encouraged effective
health-care shopping, the hospitals quickly would get the
message. Grand Rapids has an expectation that community
interests should prevail over institutional interests.
Shouldn't other communities expect the same? The health-care
system exists to serve the public, not the other way around.

   Eastern Indicted
   Over Failures
   In Maintenance

   A federal grand jury in New York indicted Eastern Airlines
and nine current and former management employees on charges
of failing to perform mandatory maintenance on Eastern
aircraft and falsifying related records.
   In announcing the indictment, U.S. District Attorney
Andrew J. Maloney alleged that the scheme was directed from
Eastern's Miami headquarters and arose as the result of
pressure by upper management to avoid costly flight delays
and cancellations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to the indictment, some employees allegedly
engaged in "pencil whipping," or signing off on work that
wasn't performed, at Eastern's maintenance bases at John F.
Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia Airport in New
York and Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta. Eastern
last year paid a $1.9 million civil penalty related to
similar charges after an investigation by the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   The 60-count indictment is unprecedented in commercial
aviation, and Mr. Maloney said at a news conference that he
sees the case as an example to the entire airline industry.
"If this is occurring at other airlines, they can expect a
lot of trouble," he said.
   In a statement released from its Miami headquarters,
Eastern reiterated that it has been extensively examined in
the past on such matters and has taken action to correct the
alleged abuses. "There is no question that Eastern is safe,"
the statement said.
   Eastern said Tuesday that plea bargain talks with
prosecutors had collapsed because it wouldn't accept a
broad-based conspiracy charge. Eastern said it had been
prepared to plead guilty to some charges of falsifying
records.
   The indictment alleges that in Atlanta, Eastern personnel
installed defective or untested electronic parts, including
cockpit instruments and other critical navigation equipment.
At all three airports, the indictment says, maintenance
personnel failed to perform repairs that would have delayed
aircraft, and then doctored records to indicate the work had
been completed.
   The defendants are also charged with conspiracy, wire
fraud and obstructing justice for giving false testimony
about the alleged plan at a Federal Aviation Administration
hearing.
   Named as defendants along with Eastern are Edward Upton,
until January a vice president, maintenance and engineering,
in Miami; Thomas Lewis, maintenance director of Eastern's
northern region airports, in Montreal, Washington and Boston;
and seven other supervisors. Mr. Upton couldn't be reached
for comment, and Eastern declined to comment on Mr. Lewis's
behalf.
   A spokeswoman for Eastern said the seven employees still
with the airline have been reassigned to non-maintenance
positions. But Mr. Maloney asserted that "up to a few days
ago, half of the managers charged were still on the payroll
and involved in maintenance."
   The Eastern spokeswoman said that effective yesterday the
seven were put on paid administrative leave and that Eastern
will pay their legal bills "as long as we are confident of
their innocence."
   If convicted on all counts, Eastern faces a maximum fine
of $30 million. Each individual defendant faces up to five
years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 on each count.
Mr. Maloney said that an indictment is expected to be filed
against another Eastern employee shortly.

   Cuts Payout 60%,

   HOUSTON -- Panhandle Eastern Corp., citing current and
potential cash problems, slashed its dividend 60% despite its
repeated insistence that the payout would remain intact.
   "Today's dividend action recognizes that financial and
operating improvements expected when we acquired {Texas
Eastern} are developing more slowly and less dramatically
than anticipated," Panhandle's new chairman, Philip
Burguieres, said in a letter to shareholders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The natural gas pipeline company's debt soared after its
$3.22 billion acquisition of Texas Eastern Corp. in early
1989, with its debt-to-equity ratio moving above 70%. At the
time, many critics were skeptical that Panhandle would have
strong enough cash flow to maintain the dividend, with some
viewing the purchase price as too high. A spokesman said the
current debt ratio of about 65% is still well above the goal
of 50%.
   While layoffs or other cutbacks haven't been announced,
the company said it would consider them. The board "directed
management to examine carefully all areas in which cash can
be saved, including capital expenditures and operating
expenses," Mr. Burguieres wrote.
   The dividend cut, to 80 cents a share annually from $2 a
share, will save Panhandle about $105 million a year. Rumors
of the cut, which the company has denied ever since the Texas
Eastern acquisition and as recently as its annual meeting in
April, had been circulating on Wall Street for several weeks.
Panhandle's stock ended yesterday at $17.875, down 75 cents
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Panhandle's difficulties were reflected in the
second-quarter earnings it announced yesterday. The company
said its loss widened to $13.6 million, or 15 cents a share,
from $5 million, or nine cents a share, a year earlier, which
included an $11.1 million one-time gain. Revenue declined
6.7% to $494 million from $529.4 million.
   Among the problems cited, the company said its cleanup of
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, at Texas Eastern pipeline
stations would exceed its earlier $400 million estimate. "We
don't know how much higher" it will be, the spokesman said.
   Unexpectedly low oil and natural gas prices in the first
half hurt pipeline volumes, particularly in the Northeast and
New England, because many customers switched to industrial
fuel oil from natural gas.
   "Competitive pressures may become even more severe over
the short term," Mr. Burguieres said. The spokesman explained
that certain Panhandle pipeline rates to the Northeast will
go up in December, which could further hurt volume.
   Also, a number of expansion projects have been delayed or
curbed, reducing expected gas volume for the company.
   Panhandle said court rulings on regulatory matters could
force refunds that would strain cash holdings in the short
run, although the company said ultimately it will reap
positive cash in these cases. Panhandle said it may have an
unexpected $100 million tax liability because of Internal
Revenue Service interpretations affecting the sale of some
Texas Eastern assets.

   Deficit-Reduction Agreement Appears
   Unlikely Before Congress Starts Recess

   WASHINGTON -- Budget negotiators appear unlikely to meet
their goal of reaching a deficit-reduction agreement before
Congress begins its August recess.
   Frustrated with the progress, President Bush in private
meetings raised the possibility of asking Congress to delay
its vacation. But leaders in Congress have asked him not to
take that action, and instead may convene summit talks during
the break.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The budget summit negotiators had hoped to reach an
agreement before the Aug. 3 beginning of the recess. But
congressional and administration officials now say that is
extremely unlikely. "It would take a miracle," said Chairman
Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) of the House Budget Committee.
   Congressional leaders advised the president not to take
the dramatic step of asking Congress to stay at work because
it would probably antagonize lawmakers more than foster
compromise. Instead, they discussed the possibility of having
the administration and congressional leaders continue talking
while Congress is away.
   The betting on Capitol Hill is that Congress will begin
its month-long vacation on time. Budget Director Richard
Darman declined to comment, but another White House official
said the president was "very serious" about his suggestion of
keeping Congress in session.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois quoted Mr.
Bush as asking, "Does it help any if I say you ought to stay
here if you don't get this agreement?" Mr. Michel also quoted
the president saying: "I want to make progress, I want to get
something going."
   "We told him the August thing is sacrosanct. He
understands that," Mr. Michel said. He also noted that it
might not make sense to keep the whole Congress in session
before an agreement is reached among the leaders.
   "It could be that we are hung up on three or four major
clumps of disagreement . . . and that we've got to have the
summit come back during August to try to get it completed,"
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said after
meeting with the president.
   Early in the day, Rep. Gephardt and White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that administration and
congressional negotiators this week hope to trade
deficit-reduction packages aimed at paring the fiscal 1991
deficit by $50 billion. Mr. Fitzwater said the two sides
planned to introduce their proposals simultaneously, but
Democrats said they hadn't agreed to that.
   Staffers later were saying that such an exchange might not
occur soon, partly because Democrats and, to a lesser extent
Republicans, are having trouble reaching agreement among
themselves. If proposals are made soon, participants in the
talks said they are more likely to be refinements of opening
bargaining positions than major moves toward compromise.
   Meanwhile, the House Ways and Means Committee voted to
extend the federal borrowing limit. Congress will need to
raise the borrowing limit before it goes on recess. The panel
approved two versions of the debt-ceiling bill. One would
extend the limit until Oct. 15, and the other would extend
the ceiling through fiscal 1991. The short-term extension is
the more likely outcome, raising the limit to $3.195 trillion
from $3.122 trillion.
   The committee also voted, at the urging of Rep. Byron
Dorgan (D., N.D.), to ask the House Rules Committee to permit
a vote on the House floor to remove the Social Security Trust
Fund from the calculations that go into the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law. That amendment would be placed on the
long-term extension.
   Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) said he
hoped any amendments that are added to the legislation be
attached to the long-term extension and that the short-term
extension be passed amendment free.

   Striking Employees
   Reject Labor Pact

   KITIMAT, British Columbia -- Striking workers at Alcan
Aluminium Ltd.'s smelter here soundly rejected a tentative
three-year contract reached Tuesday, setting the stage for a
possible shutdown of the plant.
   "We're a little surprised and a little disappointed" by
the workers' rejection of the pact, said Alcan spokesman
Allan Hewitson. The proposed accord, which was rejected by
57.4% of the workers, called for annual wage increases of 6%
in each year of the pact, plus other benefits, including an
immediate signing bonus of 1,500 Canadian dollars (US$1,297)
per worker.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Management personnel had managed to keep the smelter
operating since midnight Monday, when about 1,600 members of
the Canadian Association of Smelter and Allied Workers union
walked off their jobs as the previous two-year contract
expired. Most of the workers are employed at the smelter,
though a few operate Alcan's neighboring hyrdo-electric power
generating plant.
   Mr. Hewitson said Tuesday that management workers could
keep the 260,000-metric-ton per year aluminum smelter running
for about 48 hours, pending ratification of the proposed
contract. He wouldn't immediately confirm yesterday whether
the smelter would be shut down, in view of the vote results.
   "We're reviewing the options that we have and we'll be
making a fuller statement later," he said.
   It wasn't immediately clear why the workers rejected the
pact, though some workers said before the vote they viewed
the proposed 6% annual wage increases as inadequate, once
inflation is taken into account. The pact provided for
cost-of-living-allowance payments in the contract's third
year, but no such payments in years one and two.
   It wasn't apparent late yesterday afternoon whether any
new talks were planned between the sides.
   Montreal-based Alcan, North America's biggest producer of
primary aluminum, with large operations in Quebec, depends on
the Kitimat smelter for about 18% of its aluminum ingot
production, a spokesman said. The smelter exports about 85%
of its output to the Far East, with the balance destined for
the U.S. West Coast, Mr. Hewitson said.
   A shutdown of the smelter would likely spark an increase
in aluminum prices, which have fluctuated in recent days in
response to developments in the contract talks.
   In London Metal Exchange trading yesterday, aluminum
closed at about 72 U.S. cents per pound on a spot basis, up
from about 71 cents Tuesday. The three-month aluminum
contract price closed slightly above 73 cents a pound, up
half a cent from Tuesday.

   Schools and Choice:
   Get Down to Business

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A17
</SO>
<LP>
   Your running coverage of state Rep. Polly Williams's
Milwaukee voucher program and John E. Chubb's iconoclastic
new book, "Politics, Markets, and America's Schools," shows
that parental choice in education is where we have an
exciting confluence of the values of equity and sound
economics. Paul A. Gigot is right (Potomac Watch, June 8):
"When Brookings and the Heritage Foundation agree, the debate
on substance is over." What business does with the choice
issue will be the litmus test of its commitment to the market
principles it professes.
   In a 1989 national Gallup Poll, 60% of all respondents and
67% of non-white respondents favored allowing students and
their parents to choose their public schools, regardless of
where they live. Two recent Minnesota surveys had similar
results.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A 1985 study found that 69% of parents with children in
Chicago's public schools would enroll their children in
private schools if they could afford it. Newspaper reports
reveal that many Chicago political, civic and educational
leaders -- minority and majority leaders alike -- send their
children to private schools. And, most telling, 46% of the
children of Chicago's public-school teachers who live in the
city attend private schools, compared with 22% of all
school-age children in Chicago.
   Obviously, many of those with the ability to pay both
taxes and private-school tuition exercise their option with
no guilt about having abandoned the public-school system,
though some of them will not hesitate to use this
self-serving "abandonment" argument to deny the same option
to the 70% of poverty-level parents whose children constitute
a $2.3 billion captive market for Chicago public education.
   Many who would deny choice to the poor are proponents of
"parental empowerment" and "equity." This double standard is
cynical, condescending and insulting, ultimately disabling,
paternalism.
   At last, Chicago business leaders are realizing that we've
been overlooking a success story right under our noses: the
448 private elementary and secondary schools (religious,
independent and proprietary) serving 125,237 youngsters,
nearly one out of four students in Chicago. For example, in
our inner-city areas meeting federal poverty guidelines, 135
Catholic schools serve more than 42,000 students, of whom 80%
are minorities and 40% non-Catholics. Their tuition costs
average $1,400 per elementary and $2,800 per high-school
student, compared with $5,000 per student (K12 combined) in
the public schools.
   Why isn't business out in front, insisting that
market-like constraints be built into public education as a
condition for fiscal support? Why isn't business in every
state leading the effort for alternative teacher
certification, for privatization, for deregulation, for
genuine accountability legislation, and for the ultimate form
of accountability -- parental choice of public or private
education underwritten by vouchers, tuition tax credits or
tax rebates?

   RON BURTON SOUNDS TOO GOOD to be true -- but he is. A star
running back at Northwestern University and, later, the New
England Patriots (he was the team's first draft choice in
1960), he went on to John Hancock Insurance Co.'s sales force
in 1965 and became a member of the Million Dollar Club, the
All-America of the insurance industry.
   But Mr. Burton's real claim to fame is a list of good
deeds as long as his touchdown return of a blocked field
goal, a 91-yard run that is still a Patriot record.
   Today, Mr. Burton is an executive consultant in John
Hancock's community affairs division, traveling the country
and averaging five or six talks a week, all with the basic
message that "you can accomplish anything if you pay the
price." His record in community services is long -- he
started Pop Warner football in his home city of Framingham,
Mass., and works with Boy Scouts, crippled children, the
blind and other groups. But his pride and joy is the summer
camp for inner-city teen-agers that he runs on his farm in
western Massachusetts.
   The former running back used his savings to buy the
305-acre site in 1985. The "training village," as he calls
it, took in 20 boys the year it opened its gates. Last year,
160 attended three, six-week sessions and this summer Mr.
Burton expects about 140, in two groups. His money does more
than pay for the farm. Only about one in four of the
youngsters who come to his camp can afford the $1,500 it
costs. But if Mr. Burton feels he or she (he also has
sessions for girls) is worth the effort, he raises the money,
either from friends or from his own bank account. ("My wife
thinks I'm a nut," he once commented.)
   Mrs. Burton, nonetheless, helps run the camp along with
the five Burton children and two assistants, one of them a
lay preacher. "Most of the kids are from Boston," Mr. Burton
says, and half are white and half are black.
   What Mr. Burton most wants to give his young campers is a
sense of fellowship. Their fee covers their clothing and
"everybody looks alike," he says. "Most of these kids have
only one parent," he says. "I have two {kids} with no
permanent home and one that doesn't even have an address."
   The routine is rugged. Up at 4 a.m., Mr. Burton leads his
charges on an eight-mile run to start the day. Following the
Pledge of Allegiance, the schedule moves to sports --
basketball, baseball, soccer -- plus classroom instruction,
until lights-out at 7:30 p.m.
   Mr. Burton's one criterion is that his guests be "good
kids." To him, that means no drugs, no drinking, no smoking,
no swearing and none of what he calls "teasing." By that, he
says, "I mean you don't push anybody for any reason at all."
   The work at the camp must be paying off. "I got one kid
into West Point, one into Yale, and one into the Air Force
Academy," Mr. Burton says proudly. His stated wish is "to
reach every kid and to let them share what has been given to
me." This December, Mr. Burton, who has just turned 54, will
be inducted into the College Hall of Fame in New York, a
reward for his years toiling for Northwestern in the 1950s.
During those years, Northwestern went from no victories at
all to a respectable eight win-two loss record in 1958. Ron
Burton can be just as proud of the victories he is winning at
the Ron Burton training village.

   Business Bookshelf: Getting a Leg Up on the Competition

   Please measure your CI index right now. You may be
courting disaster. In "Outsmarting the Competition"
(Sourcebooks, 388 pages, $17.95), John McGonagle Jr. and
Carolyn Vella say that if you aren't continually trying to
find out what your competition is doing, you are failing in
"competitive intelligence," or CI.
   The authors define CI as "the use of public sources to
develop information about the competition, competitors and
market environment." Public information, they remind us, goes
much beyond what you can find in this newspaper or what the
U.S. Department of Commerce releases. It includes a document
released by a competitor as part of a lawsuit, as well as a
competitor's press release describing the marketing strategy
for a new product.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If you can answer any of the five questions listed below
you already are using some CI: Can I name five of my major
competitors? Can I name their major products or services?
What will they be doing in the next six months? Who is doing
my job at each competing firm? What is he or she doing now?
   The book gives several examples of how CI has paid off,
citing for instance an alert CEO of an office-equipment
supplier who learned in a conversation with a retailer that a
competitor had just raised prices on a product line. He
immediately faxed this information to his sales force, who
capitalized on it within a day.
   Without doubt the book's most useful attribute is its list
of sources of public information, some of which are not so
obvious: CompuServe, Investext, Mead Data Central, Dialog
Information Services.

   Richard Pascale, a management consultant, argues in his
book "Managing on the Edge" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 304 pages,
$19.95) that an accurate indicator of managerial panic is the
consumption rate and shelf life of business fads. He says
more than two dozen managerial techniques have waxed and
waned since the 1950s. The past five years have produced
Theory Z, Matrix, Managerial Grid, T Groups,
Interpreneurship, Demassing and One-Minute Managing.
   He notes that many of these techniques contain valid
ideas, but that they frequently are tried piecemeal and then
quickly abandoned. He quotes a marketing manager at an
equipment manufacturer: "In the past eighteen months, we have
heard that profit is more important than revenue, quality is
more important than profit, that people are more important
than profit, that customers are more important than our
people . . . No wonder our performance is inconsistent."
   Well, if you expected Mr. Pascale to tell us how to fix
what ails American companies without coming up with another
management technique then you truly are naive. His buzzword
answer to our problems is a new mind-set, or paradigm. It
contains four parts -- fit, split, contend and transcend.
(Has Mr. Pascale been studying management with Jesse
Jackson?)
   So what does this paradigm mean in the real world of
management? He illustrates it using Honda Motor Co., which he
says is perhaps the best managed company in the world. He
says Honda has strong values and tightly disciplined
managementthat's fit. He says it is made up of proud and
highly independent companies that produce a single highly
integrated automobile -- that's split. The company uses a
contention-management system that facilitates rather than
suppresses conflict. Yet Honda's cultural fabric transcends
all this to handle the stress without tearing.
   ---
   Everyone has been treated rudely in a store, restaurant or
on the phone with a company. Have you ever wondered why a
business allows that to happen? Clay Carr, in his book
"Front-Line Customer Service" (John Wiley, 280 pages,
$24.95), explains how to fix such problems. He argues that
changing the way employees interact with customers is
governed by how much of a commitment management is willing to
make. Management shows its commitment by a willingness to
train employees and by adopting policies that say customer
satisfaction is the company's only reason for being in
business.
   But that's not why you should read this book. Mr. Carr
describes several companies and their policies toward
customers that make you want to do business with them. He
says the single best description of total quality comes from
a flier written by L.L. Bean in 1912: "I do not consider the
sale a success until the goods are worn out and the customer
still satisfied." He describes a large auto dealership in
which the sales personnel are paid on a commission basis,
with a bonus based on customer satisfaction. The outfit also
has a quality-control coordinator, who has the power to spend
as much as $500 per customer to satisfy complaints.
   Word Perfect Corp., publisher of the popular
word-processing program, receives more than 10,000 calls a
day, every one of them free to the customer. The company
believes this service is good for business: From 1980 to 1988
its sales increased by almost 40,000%.
   Orvis Co. sells fishing equipment by mail and did about
$73 million in sales in 1988. The company has a simple policy
on customer satisfaction: The customer is always right, never
mind proof to the contrary. Orvis once replaced a three-ounce
fly rod for a customer who said he broke it while trying to
kill a snake.

   Bethlehem Steel
   Profit Fell 74%
   In 2nd Quarter

   Bethlehem Steel Corp., stung by equipment outages and
higher costs, saw second-quarter profit plunge 74%.
   The nation's second largest steelmaker earned $21.9
million, or 21 cents a share, compared with $84.1 million, or
98 cents a share, a year ago. Last year's results included
$105 million in charges to restructure the company's
BethForge and Baltimore Marine divisions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales fell 11% to $1.28 billion from $1.43 billion.
   The results, while disappointing, weren't surprising. The
Bethlehem, Pa., concern is relining a blast furnace at
Sparrows Point, Md., which analysts say accounts for 30% of
the company's capacity, as well as modernizing a hot strip
mill and making coke oven repairs. Analysts estimated that
such outages reduced earnings by 40 cents to 50 cents a
share.
   Bethlehem decided last year to conduct major maintenance
programs in 1990, believing it would be a weak year for steel
shipments. However, shipments are stronger than the industry
expected, leaving Bethlehem unable to take full advantage of
the market's current strength. But analysts believe the
present maintenance program, which will continue in the third
quarter and in early 1991, will make Bethlehem stronger in
1991. The Sparrows Point blast furnace resumed full
production in the first week of July, while more hot-strip
mill outages are scheduled for August and early 1991.
   Charles Bradford, an independent steel analyst, expects
such outages will cost Bethlehem $125 million in 1990, but
only $60 million in 1991. He noted that the extra costs are
incurred when the company takes down its hot strip mill and
buys slabs from other producers to meet customer orders. In
addition, Bethlehem has higher labor costs because of a new
labor agreement with the United Steelworkers of America,
effective June 1, 1989.
   The company noted that shipments in its basic steel
operations fell 13% in the second quarter, reflecting fewer
deliveries of semifinished steel to other steel producers.
   In spite of the reduced shipments, Bethlehem said orders
are relatively robust because of the stronger-than-expected
automotive market and fewer imports. As a result, the company
doesn't see a third-quarter seasonal decline, but expects to
ship about 2.3 million tons. And in the fourth quarter,
analysts say that Bethlehem could see strong shipments as
nervous customers stock up in advance of labor talks between
the union and USX Corp., the nation's largest steelmaker,
whose union contract expires in January.
   In the first six months, Bethlehem earned $43.2 million,
or 41 cents a share, down from $148.8 million, or $1.73 a
share, a year earlier. Sales fell to $2.49 billion from $2.84
billion.
   Bethlehem shares closed yesterday at $16, up 37.5 cents,
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Opera:
   At Goodwill Games: Russian `War and Peace'...

   Seattle -- For the New Yorker who approaches Lincoln
Center with a live feeling of dread, Seattle is the place to
be. Not in a long time have I seen a production as poetic and
powerful as "War and Peace," the opera on which Sergei
Prokofiev toiled longer than Leo Tolstoy needed to write his
epic novel about Napoleon's invasion of Russia.
   Staged by the American director Francesca Zambello for the
Seattle Opera, a brick behemoth unhappily refurbished for the
1962 World's Fair, the production helped open the Goodwill
Games on Sunday, and proved to be an even better spectacle
than the Rev. Jesse Jackson. In another venue the perennial
presidential candidate implored sweaty listeners to "hug a
Russian" -- an invitation sensible folks found easy to ignore
in sticky weather that shot into the 90s. Moscow burning
couldn't have been much hotter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sarah Caldwell's Boston company once performed the work
years ago, but "War and Peace" rarely is heard outside the
Soviet Union, and even the Bolshoi does not use an edition as
complete as Seattle's. The $2 million production ran four
hours with one intermission -- and brought onstage some 250
people, including a few soloists from the Kirov Opera, among
them a remarkable baritone named Vladimir Chernov, who sang
Andrei Bolkonsky.
   More importantly, the production demonstrated that "War
and Peace" is a superbly theatrical opera that deserves a
place in our major companies. Do those huggable Russians
still operate a gulag somewhere? I was hoping there might be
a little steel cot available for whoever at the New York City
Opera decided against collaborating with Seattle on this
venture.
   While New Yorkers gird themselves for City Opera's new
staging of "Moses and Aron" by Arnold Schoenberg, Seattle
shone a beam on an unjustly neglected work that grew like a
mushroom in the dark of Stalin's Russia. A political naif,
Prokofiev (1891-1953) started writing it a few years after
returning to Russia in 1934, where he landed, Shostakovich
once said, "like a chicken in soup."
   The rest of his life he spent picking up Stalin prizes,
six in all, and getting kicked in the pants for ideological
impurity. In "War and Peace," the Central Committee was
unhappy to detect a lack of patriotic fervor. The numerous
changes Prokofiev dutifully made included beefing up the War
section and inserting into Peace a ball scene with a waltz
for Natasha and Andrei. Stalin was very fond of Strauss
(Johann, not Richard]). But the great leader still didn't
have "War and Peace" staged during Prokofiev's lifetime, and
sent his first wife, Lina, to Siberia.
   For all that, and considering Prokofiev's talent for
churning out trashy propaganda music, "War and Peace" is
surprisingly eloquent. Prokofiev also had one of the 20th
century's great gifts for melody, and there are plenty in the
score (even if Natasha's theme is heard so often from so many
different people I was worried I might be called on next).
What surely helped inspire Prokofiev was the libretto
assistance he had from his second wife, Mira
Mendelson-Prokofieva. Against all odds, its 28 pages suggest
the descriptive immensity of Tolstoy's herniator.
   In Seattle, the opera opened with a choral epigraph as the
Russian people advanced slowly on a red-cloaked Napoleon,
singing of revenge for the pillaged motherland. They set the
scene for the ensuing 13 tableaux, returning at the opera's
end to cheer the victorious General Kutuzov. (The audience
responded by cheering them.) The music flowed seamlessly
through scenes as varied as the Rostov garden in spring to
the Borodino battleground, thanks not only to the dynamic
conducting of Mark Ermler of the Bolshoi, but to Ms. Zambello
and her singularily imaginative colleagues: set designer John
Conklin, lighting designer Neil Peter Jampolis and costumer
Bruno Schwengl.
   There is only one set, a big interior of a mansion. A
microcosm of the world outside, it changes over time into a
fire-stained ruin, through an evocative use of lights and
props. Symbolic of Napoleon's elusive prize, a model of
Moscow glows under hot gels like a golden treasure. Every
move is tightly directed, down to the extras who in the
dazzling ball scene (attractively choreographed by Vassili
Sulich) created constantly shifting views by just moving the
chairs. The 32-year-old Ms. Zambello, who has directed at La
Scala, Pesaro, Saint Louis, Houston and Chicago, achieves
more drama pushing props around than Franco Zeffirelli
manages with miles of drapes and spinning stages.
   Even better, she let the story unfold simply and
effectively, as a period piece with transcending themes that
need no contemporary filter. How many tendentious colleagues
would have resisted turning the French into Nazis at the
gates of Leningrad? Even the mention of Vilnius does not
bring to the stage any Balts begging to be free]
   A good chunk of the $2 million went into rehearsing the
huge cast, and the results show, with singers immersed in
their roles, characters firmly drawn. I have never seen Sheri
Greenawald so light on her feet. She was an affecting
Natasha, successfully conveying the girl's agitation in her
big aria. Unlike in the novel, Natasha does not marry Pierre
Bezukhov after Andrei's death. But we do hear the goodhearted
myopic sing of his love in a faintly grotesque scene in which
Natasha is trying to elope with yet a third man, only to be
caught by the motherly Maria Akhrosimova, who then asks poor
Pierre to stay for tea. Peter Kazaras, a very personable
performer, depicted Pierre perfectly.
   All the smaller roles were well done: Nicolai Ohotnikov as
Kutuzov; Julian Patrick as Napoleon; James Hoback as the
worthless Anatol; Sheila Nadler as Maria; Victoria Vergara as
Princess Helene, Pierre's pleasure-obsessed, empty-headed
wife, who wandered about with an amusing crown on her head.
   Still, it was Mr. Chernov who impressed most of all with
his vibrant baritone and natural stage presence. What
eloquence he brought to Prince Andrei's disturbing death
scene, the saddest pages in the score. Clinging to a life he
no longer wishes to leave, Andrei hears a strange, repetitive
sound; "something heavy, thudding against the walls," thinks
Natasha, who hears it too as she searches for him among the
wounded. What she's hearing is the human heart.
   Prokofiev's own death on March 5, 1953, went largely
unnoticed as Soviets wept copiously over the other corpse of
the day, Joseph Stalin's.
   Further performances are tomorrow, July 29 and 31; Aug. 2,
4 and 6. The sponsors include SAFECO Insurance Cos. and King
Broadcasting Co. Seattle is filming the production for
commercial release using high-definition television
technology that does not require the intrusively bright
lighting levels the Met's "Ring" cycle inflicted on paying
customers. In the meanwhile, a Fidelio CD set recorded by the
Sofia National Opera, sumptuously conducted by Rouslan
Raichev and featuring another impressive baritone, Lyubomir
Videnov, is a good introduction to this fine work.

   Job Networks Strain
   Under Excess Demand

   ONE OF THE BEST ways to find a job is networking: touching
base with colleagues, clients, friends and relatives.
   But many networks are straining these days as corporate
cutbacks swell a trickle of calls into a torrent. "Whenever I
go out, I get deluged," says Diane Durham, an associate
director at Cable News Network. People "want career advice,
job leads, references."
   Many contacts say job seekers are stretching the limits.
"I'm getting calls from strangers, not acquaintances or
friends," says Daniel Collins, a communications director at
Andersen Consulting in Chicago. Of a dozen recent networking
calls, only four were from callers he knew. Susan Rebell, a
vice president in New York with Decision Research, adds,
"I've never gotten so many irrelevant resumes."
   Networking "has been abused, misused and mislabeled," says
Sheryl Spanier, a senior consultant in New York with the
outplacement firm Lee Hecht Harrison Inc. "Cold-calling
people is different from networking." She suggests offering a
contact something in exchange, such as industry information
or the prospect of help later. Public-relations consultant
Byron Reimus, who is "actively helping" three or four people
job search, hopes "that if they find something, they'll
remember me" by steering projects his way.
                                                                                                       

   Headhunters Find
   Livelihood in Niches
                                                                                                       

   EMPLOYERS IN NEED of an ornamental horticulturist, an
expert in anti-submarine warfare or a sales manager versed in
the doggie bed market can probably find specialized
headhunters to help them.
   While the big executive-search firms pride themselves on
being able to fill any position for anyone at any time,
smaller companies are carving out the tiniest of markets.
"Nouveau niche," David Lord, managing editor of Executive
Recruiter News, a trade publication, calls them.
   Brakke &amp; Associates, for instance, conducts searches in
the animal and veterinary business. "It's a small industry,"
says Monty Allen, an associate with the Dallas firm, which
recently located a sales manager for an overseas firm
entering the pet-shop supply business. McCabe &amp; Schwartz, New
York, specializes in placing lawyers with pension-law
expertise. "I don't have many competitors," says Carole
Schwartz, the firm's chairman.
   For many, the search business is an outgrowth of an
earlier career. Robert Zahra long managed a Florida fern
cooperative that supplied foliage to florists. Today, he's
general manager of Florapersonnel, De Land, Fla., which finds
estate gardeners, greenhouse supervisors, and managers for
botanical gardens.
   For others, the field is a sideline. Robert W. Dingman
Co., Westlake Village, Calif., does searches in the
health-care, airline, hotel and consumer-products fields. But
one-tenth of its business is devoted to searching for heads
of religious groups and missions. "We are Christians who are
active in our faith," says partner Bruce Dingman. Searches
for religious personnel, he says, "tend to be more painful"
than ordinary business quests. "A charismatic leader {may}
have presence and speaking ability, but not necessarily a
comparable administrative ability."
                                                                                                       

   An Executive Seminar
   On Chasing Quality Prize
                                                                                                       

   THE MALCOLM Baldrige quality award program, now entering
its third year, has become an obsession at many companies.
They sink huge sums into programs to boost their chances.
Consultants promise winning advice. Now a business school has
joined the fray.
   Northwestern University's Kellogg School has developed a
five-day executive seminar, "Creating World-Class Quality,"
that might be mistaken for a how-to course on applying for
the prize. The seminar includes speakers and case studies
from Baldrige-winning companies, a dissection of the
application process and a lecture on selection criteria by
Curt Reimann, the Commerce Department official who directs
the award.
   Mr. Reimann says the goal is learning, not winning. "I
would be personally very uncomfortable in participating in
anything that could be seen as coaching, as opposed to the
larger issue of quality." But he acknowledges that the class
"would be helpful preparation" for applying for the award.
   Nancy K. Hartigan, Kellogg's executive-education director,
adds: "You're talking to the ones who've been through the
battle and won the war." Motorola Inc., a 1988 Baldrige
winner, approached Kellogg with the idea and helped create
the course, which costs $2,900 a person.
   The first session was offered last month, and some 45
managers attended -- nearly twice the usual number for a new
seminar. "We were stunned by the response," Ms. Hartigan
says. So much so that Kellogg plans to offer the course twice
yearly -- and incorporate aspects of it within the school's
M.B.A. program.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   EMPLOYEES VALUE privacy -- except when it comes to drugs.
A poll of over 800 people by the National Law Journal found
that 8% or fewer respondents believed employers should be
allowed secret monitoring of job performance, external
communications or activities outside work. Nearly 75%,
however, favored some mandatory drug testing. . . . It's a
young man's game. A study by Women, Men and Media, a research
group at the University of Southern California, finds that
63% of senior entertainment executives are male; 87% are
under 40 years old.

   Trouble Is Brewing
   Over Folgers' Use
   Of Salvadoran Beans

   Urge Changing Suppliers

   Descendants of a founding father of Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
have launched a proxy fight to force the Cincinnati-based
consumer-products giant to stop buying Salvadoran beans for
its Folgers coffee.
   James Gamble, great-great grandson and namesake of the
soap maker who founded P&amp;G with candle maker William Procter
in 1837, has submitted the proposal for consideration at
P&amp;G's annual meeting in October.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposal is backed by Mr. Gamble's brother Robert and
their father, Walter, along with P&amp;G shareholder Pat Close,
according to Steven Koenig, a vice president of the
money-management firm Franklin Research &amp; Development Corp.
Mr. Koenig said the resolution asks P&amp;G to stop buying from
suppliers in El Salvador "until parties to the Salvadoran
conflict fully negotiate a peaceful settlement of the war."
The U.S.-supported Salvadoran government has been fighting
leftist guerrillas in a civil war for about a decade.
   Mr. Koenig wouldn't disclose details about the
shareholders involved or the size of their P&amp;G holdings,
describing them only as "substantial shareholders." None of
them could be located for comment.
   P&amp;G has 102,953 shareholders, with no individual holder
owning more than 0.5% of its 346 million shares outstanding,
according to P&amp;G officials.
   Mr. Gamble has talked with P&amp;G officials, but recent talks
weren't fruitful: "We're just too far apart," Mr. Koenig
said.
   P&amp;G's board will oppose the proposal, but a spokesman
declined to comment further on Mr. Gamble's actions until
next month, when P&amp;G's proxy statement is to be mailed to
holders.
   Folgers coffee, the target of a boycott by other
activists, contains less than 2% Salvadoran beans, the
spokesman said. "Folgers has been unfairly singled out," the
spokesman said. "We're doing the right thing by abiding by
current U.S. policy" toward El Salvador, he said.
   Mr. Koenig said the group plans to send proxy solicitation
statements to all holders in the next few weeks. At the
least, the group wants enough votes to ensure that the
proposal can return to the P&amp;G ballot next year if it's
defeated in October. That would require support from holders
of 3% of the shares. "But it's not unheard of to think we
could get at least 20% to 30%," Mr. Koenig said.

   Seattle -- There is a dearth of work for lady boxer
critics, but I finally got an assignment. I slipped on my
blue satin jacket with the Knott Street Boxing Gym logo on
the back, tucked my notebook under my right tricep, but left
my boxing gloves behind. At the Goodwill Arts Festival I
would need my hands free to take notes and to applaud the
admirable skills of a couple of lady dancers who, at least
for the eight-day run of "Boxiana," double as lady boxers.
   For a work such as this, which combines dance with boxing,
it is good to have a lady boxer critic on hand. The local
newspapers sent their dance critics to opening night, but I
would guess that I was the only critic there whose writing
hand had ever sunk a couple of inches into a heavy bag.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I knew I wasn't qualified to critique the dance element of
the show, which takes place in an actual boxing ring and is
meant to replicate a women's flyweight championship bout. My
experience as a dancer is a distant blur, but I do recall
that my mother made my costume.
   As the star pupil in the Pound Away women's class ("Pound
away your frustrations and lose weight too]"), I was prepared
to scoff at the dancers' attempts to simulate boxing.
   The performance began as the 14-member Seattle Pro Musica
Women's Voices set the mood by swigging beer and brawling in
bleacher seats at ringside. Later they would punctuate the
performance with lyrics suggesting either blood lust (the
line "Dogmeat dogmeat dogmeat" comes to mind) or spiritual
journey.
   Two women sports announcers introduced the
fighter/dancers. A gymnast named Susan Galligan played Lady
Tiger, mother of two and the reigning champ. But it was
Georgia Ragsdale, playing the challenger, who made me sit up
and take notice. Ms. Ragsdale wrote and choreographed
"Boxiana," and it was soon clear that the performance was
more than just an artistic statement about violence or
spiritual journeys. It was a way for her to show off.
   I couldn't blame her. All in all she's spent two years
preparing for this role. She became a fixture at Seattle's
Hillman City Boxing Gym, and usually was the only female on
the premises. She spent hours watching tapes of boxing bouts,
studying each boxer's style. Then she put all that she'd
learned into her show, so the audience was treated to every
step of the training of a boxer. But with the chorus singing
things such as, "Yielding is the Way of the Tao," and with
various women entering the ring to snake among the boxers
with yogalike movements, the boxing show took on many levels
of meaning.
   At the center of it all was Ms. Ragsdale, bobbing and
weaving, shadowboxing, pounding the heavy bag, sparring with
a trainer (the only male in the show) and skipping rope. She
drew whistles and applause for her jump-roping, a display of
consummate skill that she made look even harder by having a
woman wearing boxing gloves punch her in the stomach every
time she missed.
   We never did that in my Pound Away class. By comparison I
felt like a real wimp. (Quick] Somebody beat me up so I can
feel good about myself.) After the show I cornered Ms.
Ragsdale for a little shop talk. She told me she's just wild
about boxing, although her original intention was to use
boxing merely as a vehicle for blending art and athletics,
and as an attention-getter for a female production. She said
her view of boxing is "a lonely spiritual journey not
accepted by society."
   She told me that she worked out at the boxing gym up to
three hours a day, six days a week, "to make this look easy."
She was trained every step of the way by a former
professional boxer. Eventually, she invested in her own wrist
wraps, sparring gloves and headgear.
   "Headgear?" I asked. "You mean you got hit in the head?"
   "Yeah," she answered breezily. "It gets your adrenaline
going. Makes you fight harder."
   Now I really felt like a wimp. In my Pound Away class, the
slogan could have been, "Train 'em, don't brain 'em." The
coach was pretty easy on us, come to think of it.
   Ms. Ragsdale is a former competitive tennis player with a
background in acting and choreography.
   But she's a boxer now. And she's looking for a fight.
   "I'm a starving artist," she told me. "Two months ago I
was on food stamps. I'm hungry enough to box professionally.
I need the money for groceries."
   I punched her respectfully on the arm and wished her luck.
   Now I'm about ready to throw in the towel as a lady boxer
critic. I never got the opportunity to scoff, which I was so
eager to do, because Ms. Ragsdale and even Ms. Galligan, who
trained only four months, probably could box circles around
me. But I guess it's not the first time a performer has known
more about a subject than the critic.
   At least I was slightly more hip than the dance critics.
One wrote that "Boxiana" was Ms. Ragsdale's way of presenting
boxing as a form of barbarism that should have been outlawed
years ago. But I knew that's not true. I saw that gleam in
her eye.
   Besides, we can't outlaw boxing. At least not until Ms.
Ragsdale earns some grocery money.

   Muenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft (Munich Re) AG
said that fiscal 1990 group net profit rose from year-earlier
levels and that the company will leave its dividend unchanged
at 10 Deutsche marks ($6.18) a share.
   The large, West German reinsurance group didn't provide
detailed earnings data, but said premium income from
reinsurance business rose 1.6% to 12.6 billion marks in the
fiscal year that ended June 30 from 12.4 billion marks the
year before

   "Overall, the fiscal 1990 result will prove to be
satisfactory," Munich Re said, adding that the strength of
the Deutsche mark had a negative impact on premium income
development. Without currency translation effects, total
group premium income actually increased more than 4%.

   James River Corp., Richmond, Va., said its European
affiliate JA/MONT N.V. bought Cartellas S.A. and Achaia S.A.,
two tissue companies in Athens, Greece, formerly owned by the
Panopoulos family.
   Terms were not disclosed. The two companies, which market
under the Delica brand name in Greece, posted combined 1989
sales of $40.7 million. Sales for Cartellas were $33.5
million; sales for Achaia were $7.2 million.
</LP>

   The two companies combined represent the second largest
tissue producer in the Greek market, with a 15 to 20% share,
the company said.
   The acquisition is the first by JA/MONT V.A., a joint
venture formed this year that combined James River's European
tissue interests with those of Gruppo Ferruzzi of Italy and
Nokia Corp. of Finland. The joint venture expects sales of
$1.6 billion in 1990.

   NEW YORK -- Stocks rebounded as investors started to scoop
up beaten-down shares, switching into previously neglected
industry groups.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 8.42 to 2930.94.
New York Stock Exchange volume of 163,530,300 shares was the
lightest in four days. Advancing issues on the Big Board
outpaced decliners, 895 to 583.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Oil stocks tanked. Mary Quinn, oil stock analyst at S.G.
Warburg, said investors were taking profits on the group,
especially with meetings of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries under way. Chevron fell 1 to 77 3/4, and
Exxon dropped 3/8 to 49 5/8. Ms. Quinn issued a sell
recommendation on Mobil, which fell 1 to 66. Mobil "is a
little expensive relative to the group and its prospects,"
she said. Ms. Quinn restated a buy recommendation on Atlantic
Richfield because she thinks the value of certain assets
haven't been appreciated. Atlantic gained 1/4 to 125 3/4.
   Despite the sell-off in major energy issues, a 1 1/2-point
rise in Alcoa to 69 1/8 and a 1 3/8-point gain in Boeing to
58 1/4 helped lift the industrial average to a second
consecutive gain.
   Dozens of other metals stocks climbed yesterday, and some
investors seem to be making a bet that inflation will surge
again, said Robert Devine, head of equity trading at UBS
Securities Inc. Phelps Dodge gained 1 3/4 to 69 1/8, for
example.
   Stocks coming back to life yesterday after previous
earnings-related routs included Capital Cities/ABC, which
gained 12 1/8 to 545 1/8; Storage Technology bounced 1 1/8 to
27 1/8.
   However, the earnings surprise blood-letting started again
in other shares. L.A. Gear tumbled 2 1/8 to 23 on fears of
weaker-than-expected earnings.
   Sellers circled around Digital Equipment yesterday morning
after the company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $2.11 a
share, which included a $400 million charge related to
layoffs and other cost-reduction measures.
   The Big Board flashed a pre-opening indication that the
stock might open 7 1/2 points lower than Tuesday's close. But
buyers flocked to the stock and Digital opened 1/8 higher at
75 5/8 at 9:48 a.m. EDT and traded as high as 78. During the
order imbalance, news services reported that Digital planned
to cut as many as 6,000 jobs, which also helped draw in
buyers, traders said. However, sellers had the upper hand at
the close, and pushed the stock down 5/8 to 74 7/8.
   Other technology issues regained favor: International
Business Machines was unchanged at 114 3/4; Compaq Computer
advanced 2 to 59 3/8; Hewlett-Packard added 7/8 to 45 1/8;
NCR rose 1/2 to 69 and Motorola gained 2 1/8 to 79 3/4.
   Cray Research fell 2 to 45 in the wake of its
second-quarter earnings report. While earnings and revenue
for the quarter were sharply higher than a year earlier, the
company said it expects "flat" revenue for the full year.
   Meanwhile, latest results from Investors Intelligence
showed that 49.6% of participants in their "Sentiment Index"
survey were bullish -- matching the highest reading of the
year. The survey said 34.1% were bearish and 16.3% expected a
correction in the stock market. Many of the forecasts were
made before Monday's market drop.
   Du Pont rose 1/2 to 39 3/8 after issuing its report for
the quarter, which was stronger than generally expected
despite a 2.8% decline in net income. Other chemical stocks
to attract buyers included Union Carbide, which rose 3/4 to
20 as two million shares changed hands, and Monsanto, which
added 3/4 to 51.
   On the other hand, investors continued to dump shares of
Dow Chemical, which lost 3/8 to 52 on 1.8 million shares. The
stock plummeted 5 3/4 Tuesday after the company reported that
second-quarter net fell 50% and that earnings may be softer
in the second half, compared with the first.
   Gerber Scientific plunged 2 7/8 to 10 3/8 after saying it
expects earnings for the six months ending in October to be
significantly lower than in the year-ago period, when it
posted net of 66 cents a share.
   Network Equipment Technologies, which posted a loss for
the fiscal quarter ended last month and announced changes in
its management, dropped 3/8 to 7 3/4.
   Upjohn rose 2 1/8 to 42 7/8 on 1.6 million shares amid a
revival of takeover speculation. The list of rumored suitors
includes American Home Products, Schering-Plough and
Britain's Glaxo Holdings. Also, West Germany's Hoechst was
cited in the latest bout of speculation; a spokesman for its
U.S. unit, Hoechst Celanese, declined to comment, as did
Upjohn.
   General Instrument declined 7/8 to 44 3/4 on 1.2 million
shares after a potential rival bidder to Forstmann, Little &amp;
Co., which has agreed to acquire the company in a leveraged
buy-out at $44.50 a share, disclosed it wasn't interested in
a takeover. Shortly before the close, trading was halted as
the company said neither that party nor another entity to
which it had provided confidential information would mount a
bid.
   Dividend-related trading boosted volume in Chase
Manhattan, which gained 5/8 to 20 3/8 and topped the list of
most active Big Board issues on 4.1 million shares, and
Citicorp, which rose 3/8 to 21 on 3.6 million shares. Both
bank holding company issues both carry hefty dividend yields
and go exdividend this week.
   Two new mutual funds investing overseas, Singapore Fund
and Latin American Investment Fund, closed below the price of
their initial public offerings in active trading. Singapore
Fund fell 1/4 from its offering price to 11 3/4 on 1.3
million shares, or more than one-quarter of the five million
shares sold in the offering. Latin American closed at 14 3/4
on 1.4 million shares; the initial offering of four million
shares was made at $15 each.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.44
to 356.95. Volume totaled 11,200,000 shares.

   London United Investments PLC agreed in principle with
creditors on a debt-payment plan under which the British
insurance holding company probably will pay less than full
value on as much as #1 billion ($1.82 billion) in potential
insurance liabilities.
   The company has been managed by two court-appointed
administrators since May, when it failed in a seven-week
effort to find new funds to meet potential U.S. liability
claims. The insurance holding company's collapse ranks among
the biggest insurance industry debacles in the London market
in recent years.

   Yesterday, the company's administrators said they intend
to sell several insurance units and broking assets to raise
funds to meet some future claims. The company said the most
significant unit on the auction block is Hartford,
Conn.-based First Reinsurance Co. A company official said
First Reinsurance's net asset value is about $25 million. All
told, the disposals are likely to raise less than $100
million, he said.

   Brady Supports
   Lifting Curbs
   On Bank Lines

TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE)
CONGRESS (CNG)

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called for
broadening the businesses that banks can engage in, but added
that they should have to meet strict capital standards so
that deregulation doesn't foster the reckless practices that
created the thrift debacle.
   Mr. Brady, in testimony before the Senate Banking
Committee, said the Treasury is worried that banks'
profitability is being hurt by restrictions that prevent them
from fully entering the securities and insurance business,
and from opening branches throughout the U.S. Many of the
banks' best customers, "including blue-chip corporations, now
borrow directly from investors" through short-term debt
securities, Mr. Brady said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The result has been concentration in the riskiest lines
of permitted business, such as commercial real estate
lending, highly leveraged transactions, and loans to lesser
developed countries," the Treasury secretary said. He added
that the limitations are creating "greater risk to the system
and the taxpayer, not less."
   Mr. Brady's comments were the opening salvo in a
controversial attempt to expand bank powers. The Treasury is
preparing proposals to restructure the banking industry and
the deposit-insurance system and expects to announce them by
early next year. But amid the savings-and-loan bailout,
expected to cost the government up to $500 billion with
interest, many members of Congress are wary of giving banks
more powers.
   But Mr. Brady, echoing the view of many banking experts,
said lack of capital was the culprit in the S&amp;L mess, not the
deregulation of the industry in the early 1980s. Capital
represents the investment of a bank's or thrift's owners that
is drained off before federal deposit insurance is called in.
Though he didn't specifically call for higher capital
requirements, Mr. Brady suggested that broader powers should
be given only to well-capitalized institutions.
   "I can't imagine recommending any changes in the banking
law that wouldn't put a very high premium on capital," he
said.
   Mr. Brady was less specific about the Treasury's proposals
to change deposit insurance, but appeared to be leaning
toward recommending that the $100,000 insurance limit on
deposits remain in place. "We've got to take a very hard look
at that problem," he said. "But frankly, I can't see at this
particular point in time a rush to lower that amount of
insurance when we have a question of confidence not only in
our banks, but obviously in our thrifts."
   Asked by Sen. Alan Dixon, (D., Ill.) about limiting
deposit insurance to one account per person, a very popular
idea on Capitol Hill these days, Mr. Brady said, "Well, if
you were going to start anyplace, that would be a place to
start."
   Commenting on recent statements by William Seidman, head
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., that the FDIC's
bank-insurance fund is "under stress," Mr. Brady emphasized
"the qualification" Mr. Seidman made: that it would take a
severe recession before taxpayer dollars would be required to
back up the bank fund. "We can't make all our economic
judgments" as if a big recession is in the offing, the
Treasury secretary said.
   "The point is to stay out of a severe recession, which I
think we will do," he added. Mr. Brady also rejected
suggestions by some private analysts that the banking
industry is currently harboring problems that could grow to
the size of the S&amp;L crisis in a few years. "To compare the
banking system to the S&amp;Ls in 1988 is a comparison I don't
think should be made," he said.

   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers,
perhaps the nation's most prestigious high-tech
venture-capital group, is being haunted by the ghost of a new
machine.
   Kleiner Perkins isn't a likely victim. It has helped
launch scores of high-tech companies, including such major
names as Genentech, Tandem, Lotus, Compaq and Sun, and has
flouted venture-capital conventions. Unlike most investing
outfits, which finance ideas brought to them, Kleiner Perkins
is an entrepreneur factory. It often finances its partners'
own ideas and then lets them staff the new companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One of those ideas developed into Dynabook Technologies
Corp., a laptop-computer maker. Founded in 1987 by Vinod
Khosla and L. John Doerr, Dynabook had all the makings of a
classic Kleiner Perkins triumph.
   The two Kleiner Perkins partners are among the savviest
high-tech risktakers. Mr. Khosla, 35, co-founded two sizable
high-tech companies before turning 30; one was Sun
Microsystems Inc., now the world's largest maker of computer
workstations. Mr. Doerr, 39, helped finance and plot strategy
for both Sun and Compaq Computer Corp., another runaway hit.
He also helped stitch together Symantec Corp., now a large
software company.
   "They are the supermen of Silicon Valley," says Dave
Winer, a Menlo Park, Calif., software entrepreneur.
   And Dynabook's new machine was their brainchild. It was to
be a slim, stylish but powerful laptop computer that they
hoped would help them create another big company. Mr. Khosla
and Mr. Doerr, both with advanced degrees in engineering and
computer science, conceived of the machine themselves. Then,
they hired outsiders to design it, a contractor to make it
and managers to sell it. They also raised $37 million over
three years, making Dynabook one of the best-financed
computer start-ups.
   Also top-drawer were the investors. They included Pierre
Lamond, who has backed many successful chip companies, and
Marc Rossi, a Prudential Insurance unit's venture capitalist
who financed the extraordinarily fast-growing Conner
Peripherals Inc. Mr. Khosla invested $3 million of his own
money, plus $8 million from Kleiner Perkins.
   Despite this endowment, Dynabook has staggered along,
crippled by a remarkable string of mistakes. Its original
design flopped. Its manufacture was botched. And its
management was fragmented and confused even though led by Dan
H. Wilkie, who helped to launch International Business
Machines Corp.'s original personal computer. For nearly two
years, for instance, Dynabook relied on consultants and
outside contractors rather than hiring a full-time
engineering chief. The temporaries hampered recruiting by
making Dynabook look like "a rent-a-company," says Russ Bik,
a former Dynabook executive.
   In the months before Dynabook's problems came to a head,
it pulled some questionable stunts. Its board fired Mr.
Wilkie just before the official product roll-out but, for the
event, had him masquerade as chief executive. By early this
year, Dynabook could keep going only with the help of
$500,000 from a landlord so eager to fill an empty building
that he didn't notice his tenant was crumbling.
   Today, Dynabook is a shell, its staff reduced to about 28
from a high of 140. Its assets -- including a fresh design
for a laptop with a color screen -- are on the selling block,
with Unisys Corp. the most likely buyer at the moment. "Our
goal is to get a substantial portion of the investors' money
back," says a chastened Mr. Khosla. But people close to the
deal with Unisys, which confirms it has struck "an agreement
of intention to purchase" Dynabook, say the sale will yield
only about $5 million.
   Kleiner Perkins's mishandling of Dynabook lends ammunition
to critics of its practice -- avoided by many venture
partnerships -- of hiring professional managers for ventures
dreamed up by its partners. Even Eugene Kleiner, its
now-retired co-founder, agrees it is hard to tell when hired
managers have the requisite passion for a venture because "if
you make {it} tempting enough, everyone becomes an
entrepreneur."
   Dynabook's fall also suggests that, with high tech
increasingly dominated by global companies, venture
capitalists probably won't, anytime soon, reap the bonanzas
common a decade ago. And it makes it clear that
entrepreneurs, not venture capitalists, are crucial to
forging companies. Dynabook got into trouble because "it
didn't have {that} entrepreneur," says Scott Metcalf, now its
president. "It relied on a professional team that came in to
execute someone else's ideas."
   Mr. Doerr insists, however, that some of Dynabook's hired
managers did have an entrepreneurial stake, and he doesn't
see any special lessons in its problems. "This is the one in
four deals that fails," he simply declares.
   From the start, the Achilles' heel of Dynabook was its
technology. Mr. Doerr struck a deal with Nara Technologies
Corp., a San Jose, Calif., firm, to design the laptop. Todd
Morgenthaler, Nara's president, told Mr. Doerr that he had
figured out a way to produce on a single piece of silicon the
main circuitry of IBM's PC AT, then its flagship personal
computer. Even today, producing such a design is difficult,
but the benefits are lower manufacturing costs and lower
power consumption, both big pluses for a new laptop.
Impressed, Mr. Doerr made Mr. Morgenthaler an offer: Build
Dynabook's laptop and receive continuing fees from a
five-year development contract, a seat on the company's board
and a roughly 25% stake in the company.
   Mr. Morgenthaler accepted. In the spring of 1987, Nara
launched into the electronics. By year end, Dynabook wanted
to have a working prototype by mid-May 1988, with the
product's introduction at the mammoth Comdex trade show in
Las Vegas that fall.
   But the plan unraveled. Mr. Morgenthaler became distracted
by a brother dying of cancer. Nara couldn't complete a
video-graphics device that controls the laptop's display
screen; Dynabook had to buy it elsewhere. Nara's single-chip
design and a so-called glue chip that was to hold together
the circuitry never worked, either. Dynabook scrapped
virtually all of the work Nara did during some 18 months.
   In the end, "everything {Nara supplied} had to be redone,"
says Joseph Sarubbi, who designed IBM's highly successful PC
XT and joined Dynabook full time in January 1989 as chief
engineer.
   Although Mr. Morgenthaler concedes he faced unexpected
difficulties, he says Nara's designs would have worked if
only Mr. Doerr had given him more time. But in early 1989,
Nara was essentially dismissed, he says, adding: "I was
treated like hired help."
   That wasn't the end of Dynabook's design troubles,
however. After introducing the laptop in July 1989, Dynabook
discovered a problem with the power supply. Then, after
manufacturing began, scores of small but irritating design
errors turned up, forcing many revisions. "The number of
changes was far greater at that point in the production
process than you would have expected," says Mr. Bik, who
oversaw Dynabook's materials and facilities for eight months
in 1989.
   The final blow came last fall. After the computer had been
shipped to dealers, its Japanese-made screen proved
defective. "Customers didn't see a perfect display -- they
saw problems," says Mr. Khosla, who calls these defects
"pivotal."
   Besides the technical glitches, the company's top
executives, hand-picked by Mr. Doerr and Mr. Khosla, failed
to deliver.
   At the heart of the team was Mr. Wilkie, famous for the
success of IBM's PC. After leaving IBM, he oversaw Tandon
Corp.'s entry into the PC field but left Tandon when that
business hit the skids. To Mr. Wilkie, Dynabook was a chance
to run another fast-growing computer company. Mr. Doerr and
Mr. Khosla talked of first-year sales reaching $100 million,
and they told him not to worry about engineering, that Nara
was handling it. In late 1987, he joined Dynabook as chief
executive.
   For four or five months, Mr. Wilkie worked alone. He then
hired a half-dozen consultants, mainly former Tandon
executives, and opened an office near his home in Southern
California, an hour's flight from Nara's offices. By then,
Dynabook still hadn't hired its first engineer, but Mr.
Wilkie was relying on Nara and, anyway, he was busy trying to
raise money. That "took away my attention from the business,"
he recalls.
   Dynabook was initially funded in September 1987 with $1.8
million, mostly from Kleiner Perkins. The next June, Sequoia
Capital, Mr. Lamond's firm, led a $9 million round of
financing, but the money was contingent upon Mr. Wilkie's
meeting certain milestones every six weeks. It was
nerve-racking. "I was within one to two weeks of not meeting
payroll four times," Mr. Wilkie recalls. "You slept with your
eyeballs open a great deal."
   Meanwhile, Mr. Wilkie argued regularly over the
qualifications for Dynabook's first senior engineering
executive. Mr. Wilkie wanted an expert in systems; Mr. Doerr
fought for a specialist in chips. "For about six months, we
went through an exasperating search," Mr. Wilkie says.
   Company directors say such issues exaggerated the weak
points of Mr. Wilkie, who they say is more comfortable
running a large organization and delegating sticky problems
to others. "He's the type of manager who feels spending money
is the way to solve a problem," Mr. Lamond, a director, says.
   For instance, Mr. Wilkie funded numerous duplicate
projects, particularly in engineering. He argues that the
projects were needed as "backups" to Nara's work, but Mr.
Lamond insists that a cannier executive would have conserved
cash by sorting out Nara's problems.
   Another alleged shortcoming: Mr. Wilkie gave in too
readily to his executives' whims. He allowed Michael
Shabazian, who persuaded ComputerLand Corp. to sell the
untested Dynabook laptop, to work out of an office near his
home in Pleasonton, Calif., an hour from Dynabook's
headquarters. He also allowed Mr. Sarubbi to maintain his
primary residence in Florida even after becoming permanent
engineering chief. (Mr. Wilkie says the only way to hire the
two men was to permit such arrangements. He adds that he
planned to consolidate Dynabook's operations "at some
point.")
   Even in the area of manufacturing, his specialty at IBM,
Mr. Wilkie slipped. To build Dynabook, he hired SCI Systems
Inc., a contract manufacturer in Huntsville, Ala., that he
had worked with while at Big Blue. Besides trusting SCI's
executives, Mr. Wilkie says he chose SCI because it advanced
Dynabook a multimillion-dollar credit line.
   But relying on a distant manufacturer proved troublesome
when the laptop's design was being revised. Strangely, SCI
had a plant near San Jose, but Mr. Wilkie didn't use it
because it was too small to handle anticipated volumes.
   That arrangement, which SCI won't discuss, later hurt
Dynabook. SCI had such a hard time building the computer,
partly because of numerous design changes, that "we were not
confident enough in SCI's outgoing quality to send the
products directly to customers," Mr. Bik says. "So, all units
were coming to California, and we were testing them again."
   While SCI was ramping up production, Mr. Wilkie, ever
hedging his bets, was paying a consultant $20,000 to
determine the best location to build the product.
   Mr. Wilkie also signed a contract giving SCI the right to
tack its profit margin on top of its costs. Dynabook
executives say the deal gave SCI little incentive to hold
down costs. But Eugene Sapp, SCI's president disagrees,
saying he insisted on the proviso because he anticipated some
of the production snafus that lay ahead. From the beginning,
he says, "the product was not mass-producible" because
Dynabook tried to pack "too many technical innovations" into
it.
   In the midst of all this, Mr. Wilkie's spirit was
flagging. In March 1989 -- just as Dynabook was about to
close on $11 million in new venture money -- he was
approached by an executive recruiter seeking to interest him
in a position at Apple Computer Inc. Mr. Wilkie was curious,
but before pursuing the post he went to Mr. Khosla and Mr.
Doerr. "They both, without exception, indicated how the
company would fall apart if I left," says Mr. Wilkie, who
decided to stay put. (Mr. Khosla denies this. "I never
encouraged Dan to stay. That's nonsense," he says.)
   Three months later, Mr. Wilkie was out of a job. At a
board meeting June 8, Mr. Khosla was installed as president,
though Mr. Wilkie got until July 15 to arrange his departure
terms. Indeed, his exit was a condition of further venture
funding; the directors even turned down his offer to go to
Huntsville for three months to sort out manufacturing
glitches. "We invested in Dan Wilkie, and we made a mistake,
a terrible mistake," Mr. Lamond says.
   In his defense, Mr. Wilkie insists he was betrayed by
Messrs. Khosla and Doerr, saddled with a botched product and
forced to embrace a series of quick fixes, rather than
fundamental changes, to keep Dynabook's doors open. After
hitting serious problems, "we continued to measure progress
in six-week increments . . . instead of saying what can be
done in six months," Mr. Wilkie says. "But each time I said
that, Khosla and Doerr said, `In that case, Dynabook is going
to crash and burn.'"
   The timing of Mr. Wilkie's departure was bad, however.
With Dynabook planning to introduce its long-delayed computer
in less than two weeks, news that he had been fired could
only detract from its debut. So, Mr. Khosla, Mr. Doerr and
Dynabook's other directors decided to lie about Mr. Wilkie's
status to the press, industry analysts and Dynabook's own
employees. And Mr. Wilkie played along, portraying his role
at Dynabook as important and touting the company's prospects.
   As Mr. Wilkie's fate was being decided, Mr. Shabazian,
Dynabook's second-ranking executive, flew to Philadelphia.
The next day, Mr. Shabazian accepted a job as chief operating
officer of Intelligent Electronics, a national computer
retailer. "John {Doerr} was trying to put the squeeze on me
to stay," Mr. Shabazian says. "He didn't need two of his key
guys to leave at once." Mr. Shabazian announced his own
resignation at Dynabook's product introduction on June 20 in
New York.
   Mr. Wilkie says he kept quiet about his firing to spare
Dynabook further embarrassment -- and to help him obtain a
severance package that would pay him $15,000 a month for
nearly a year. He also says he thought he could persuade
Dynabook's board to reverse its decision or at least make his
exit "more controlled."
   That was wishful thinking. Soon, Dynabook's employees
learned of the situation. "I found out at the {product}
announcement that they'd let Dan go -- I was shocked," Mr.
Sarubbi says. "In my mind, you don't wait until announcement
time to terminate somebody."
   Mr. Khosla admits Dynabook's board erred in not disclosing
Mr. Wilkie's departure straightaway. "That's probably our
mistake," he says. But "it should have been clear to people,"
he argues, that Mr. Wilkie's days were numbered when he, Mr.
Khosla, assumed the presidency.
   With Mr. Wilkie gone -- he now is president of Solbourne
Computer Inc., a private company in Longmont, Colo. -- Mr.
Doerr and Mr. Khosla felt the full weight of Dynabook's
problems. They hustled in a new cast of executives, but even
the new people were mystified as to how the two renowned
venture capitalists could have let Dynabook slip so badly.
"Because I had worked with Doerr and Khosla at other
companies, I was amazed that they would allow this to occur,"
Mr. Bik says.
   Even worse, the company was again running out of money.
Mr. Doerr and Mr. Khosla were hunting for prospective
investors as well as employees. In September, they collected
$7 million from a half-dozen venture firms, including $3
million from Prudential's venture arm. Montgomery Securities
kicked in $1 million; so did Goldman Sachs, which only six
months earlier had invested $4 million in Dynabook.
   None of the September investors would comment on their
decision to invest in Dynabook, but people familiar with
their thinking say they were swayed by Mr. Khosla's and Mr.
Doerr's optimism. That wasn't idle chatter. Kleiner Perkins
added $3 million to the deal, and Mr. Khosla personally
plunked down $1.1 million.
   Investors also were influenced by the involvement of James
Lally, who was known for his ability to turn around
companies. Mr. Lally became Dynabook's chief operating
officer in June.
   But to the investors' disappointment, Mr. Lally was active
in Dynabook for only a short time after the financing was
closed. (He couldn't be reached for comment.) Mr. Khosla
decided to ship Dynabook's laptop in November, but by then
Compaq had unveiled a new portable that was winning raves.
   The ComputerLand dealers, who had signed on months earlier
to sell Dynabooks, were gloomy. "All of our {salespeople}
were trained, but by the time we got the product, people had
lost interest in it," says Jeffrey Inwood, who has four
ComputerLand stores in Michigan.
   And then Mr. Khosla left the daily running of the company
in order to attend to other investments. Replacing him was
Bernard Lacroute, another Kleiner Perkins staffer who had
recently left Sun, where he had been the second-ranking
executive. Mr. Lacroute, himself a temporary, hired Harold L.
"Sparky" Sparks, also between jobs, to launch a new marketing
campaign. Mr. Sparks spent much of Dynabook's remaining cash
on a blitz of television commercials.
   It was Dynabook's last gasp. Few customers wanted the
laptop; those that did were put off by the newly discovered
defects in its screen. Mr. Lacroute decided to stop selling
the laptop and concentrate on designing future machines from
scratch.
   Even then, however, Mr. Khosla and Mr. Doerr were able to
raise more money for Dynabook. On Dec. 7, they obtained $3
million from the Economic Development Board of Singapore.
Though Dynabook was within days of missing its payroll, the
Singaporeans believed their involvement "would enable
Dynabook to have access to cost-competitive manufacturing in
Singapore and to expand its marketing into Europe and the Far
East," says Kris Leong, an executive at the agency.
   Although some observers think the Singaporeans were
misled, Mr. Khosla says they "were given a clear indication
of Dynabook's condition." Ms. Leong agrees, saying her agency
was well aware of Dynabook's "high risks."
   Yet when the agency's representative discovered just how
high those risks were, he wasn't amused. Attending his first
board meeting Dec. 19, Lit-Cheong Chong snapped, "We Far East
Asian investors aren't here to be milked."
   And in January, Dynabook's future landlord forked over
$500,000 in much-needed cash -- not as an investment but as
an inducement for Dynabook to move into a new office (which
it vacated July 1). On Feb. 13, Mr. Lacroute laid off most of
Dynabook's workers. Then, in May, Unisys, which wants to
build Dynabook's color laptop, advanced the company enough
money to meet its payroll, and it chipped in further cash in
July when it agreed to consider buying the company. Now, a
team of Unisys executives are deciding whether to complete a
purchase of Dynabook, scutinizing the company's operations
and, says a Unisys spokesman, "looking for any skeletons in
the closets."

   Deutsche Bank's Morgan Grenfell Buys
   Stake in Gleacher's Mergers Boutique

   NEW YORK -- Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, the British
securities unit of Deutsche Bank AG of West Germany, acquired
a minority stake in the mergers advisory boutique of Eric
Gleacher, former head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co.
   The new firm of Gleacher Morgan Grenfell Inc. aims to
advise U.S. companies seeking to make investments in Europe
and European companies making acquisitions in the U.S.
Neither party would disclose terms, and both sides disputed
industry reports that the deal amounts to $30 million for a
one-third stake.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The alliance gives Mr. Gleacher, who opened his boutique
after leaving Morgan Stanley early this year, access to a
broad array of international clients, particularly through
Deutsche Bank, which acquired Morgan Grenfell late last year
for the equivalent of $1.6 billion, the highest price ever
paid for an investment bank. The move by Deutsche Bank comes
amid a surge in merger activity in Europe before its planned
market unification in 1992.
   "I think this helps improve Eric's edge, from our point of
view, in his being able to come up with some possibilities
and ideas in other parts of the world," said Charles Michel
Harper, chairman of ConAgra Inc., which Mr. Gleacher advised
in a planned $1.3 billion purchase of Beatrice Co. this
summer.
   "It takes him from being a litle boutique to being an
international player overnight," said Donald Drapkin, a
former takeover lawyer who is vice chairman of Revlon Group
Inc.
   It also will bolster the mergers advisory practice of
Morgan Grenfell, which was shaken by a 1986 scandal involving
charges that one of its clients, Guinness PLC, manipulated
the price of a takeover target.
   Mr. Gleacher said the alliance will give the firm "a major
flow of business." He said he aims eventually to expand the
firm, which has 10 professionals and 10 staff members, to
between 30 and 40 professionals.
   Guy Dawson, a Morgan Grenfell director based in London,
said his firm's U.S. strategy has been to pursue "middle
market" transactions involving smaller companies. But after
the Deutsche Bank acquisition, he said, Morgan Grenfell wants
to "reposition itself" to pursue "bigger transactions."
   "Morgan Grenfell needs capability and credibility in the
U.S.," Mr. Gleacher said. "That's what we're for." His new
firm also will pursue merchant banking transactions, in which
the firm invests its own money in deals, and may attempt to
raise a fund for that purpose.
   After the new linkup, most of Morgan Grenfell's U.S.
mergers and corporate finance professionals are likely to
leave the firm, including their leader, Martin R. Wade III.
Mr. Gleacher, who worked at Lehman Brothers before moving to
Morgan Stanley in the mid-1980s, plans to interview some of
the Morgan Grenfell people and may hire a few for his own
operation.
   Though several U.S. merger boutiques have sold stakes to
Japanese partners, Mr. Gleacher's is one of the first to link
up with a European partner.
   Unlike U.S. banks, Deutsche Bank is both a commercial bank
and an investment bank. It has large money management
operations and an insurance company, and it holds big stakes
in many of West Germany's biggest corporations.
   For example, the bank owns 28.2% of Daimler-Benz AG, one
of West Germany's largest manufacturing companies, and 10% of
Allianz AG, Europe's biggest insurer. Some bankers contend
that because of these links, Deutsche Bank has the best
client list in Europe.
   At year end, Deutsche Bank had assets of 344 billion marks
($212.5 billion) and through various subsidiaries, including
Morgan Grenfell, had 125 billion marks under management. The
bank's shareholder equity totals about $10.1 billion.
   Behind Deutsche Bank's latest step is the planned 1992
abolition of trade and investment barriers among the 12
countries of the European Community. Merger activity in
Europe has been accelerating as companies attempt to position
themselves for a bigger but more competitive European market.
   Deutsche Bank also has moved aggressively along with its
corporate clients into Eastern Europe, particularly East
Germany, since the Soviet bloc began crumbling late last
year.

   RJR Refinancing
   Would Have Cut 10%

   NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc. said its pending $7 billion
refinancing package would have trimmed its interest costs
about 10% for this year's first six months to $1.46 billion.
   The tobacco and food company is retiring substantial
amounts of its high-cost debt, including more than $4.4
billion of high-yield, below-investment-grade "junk" bonds.
RJR is financing the transaction with bank loans, a new issue
of convertible preferred stock, and a $1.7 billion equity
infusion from its principal shareholder, Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In formal exchange-offer documents filed yesterday, RJR
said its refinancing plan is intended to "improve the
creditworthinesss" of the highly leveraged company. Had the
refinancing plan been in effect, RJR said that because of
lower interest costs, its $330 million loss for the first
half would have shrunk to $216 million before preferred
dividends.
   RJR also said that its debt-to-equity ratio, which stood
at 24 to 1 June 30, would have dropped to 4 to 1 under the
recapitalization, if preferred stock were counted as equity,
or 8 to 1 if preferred were counted as debt.
   RJR also disclosed more details about negotiations earlier
this month to reset the interest rates on its bonds maturing
in 2007 and 2009: RJR said its investment banker, Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., had recommended new rates of 16 1/2% and 17%,
respectively. But two other investment banks acting on behalf
of bondholders, Dillon, Read &amp; Co. and Lazard Freres &amp; Co.,
had called for rates of 17 1/2% and 18%, respectively.
   When the three investment banks couldn't reach agreement,
the issue was settled July 15 by the investment bank
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. It picked rates
of 17% for the bonds of 2007 and 17 3/8% for the bonds of
2009. The rates are intended to make sure that the bonds
trade at their full face value.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Some Agencies Have More Than One Style

   LOS ANGELES -- Ad No. 1: Arty, cinematic-style cuts of the
Acura Legend are mixed with quick shots of landscapes as a
dreamy score swells on the soundtrack. Ad No. 2: College kids
swap dippy pickup talk as "Riunite on Ice. That's nice." --
the wine maker's age-old slogan -- is repeated in the
background.
   Hard to believe, but both ads came out of the same agency:
Ketchum Advertising. Back East, where copywriters concocted
the Riunite slogan, Pittsburgh-based Ketchum is known for its
traditional but entirely unexciting advertising. In the
shop's offices here, where the Acura account is serviced, and
in San Francisco, the creative work is known for being
daring.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ketchum is one of a handful of big agencies whose
personalities are at polar extremes in different parts of the
country. While many agencies strive for a single culture and
attitude, Ketchum and a few others seem almost schizophrenic
in how different their various offices' personalities can be.
   Ad industry consultants, influential in guiding clients to
agencies, say the independent, sometimes conflicting images
coming out of a single agency can be confusing. "It's quite
possible for the uninitiated, unsophisticated client to have
some trouble sorting this all out," says William Weilbacher,
an advertising consultant at Bismark Corp. in New York.
   But agencies that claim a host of diverse identities
insist that clients aren't muddled at all, because the office
a particular client signs on with is the only one they care
about. At Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, for example, the San
Francisco office is known as a creative hot shop for its work
on the Levi's and California Raisins accounts, while its New
York office is one of the most traditional of all agencies,
with conservative packaged-goods ads for products such as
Oreo cookies.
   Yet Mike Koelker, executive creative director at Foote
Cone's office in San Francisco, says the offices operate
autonomously and things work just fine. "The company really
does take pride in regional differences," he says. He adds
that until a couple of years ago, when he had worked for the
agency for about eight years, he hadn't even met top
executives at many of the other Foote Cone offices.
   Ketchum's chairman and chief executive officer, Bill
Genge, also defends the disparate cultures that make up his
agency, and contends the diverse talent and personalities
help the agency when it comes to new business, among other
things. "They do share the Ketchum culture and the Ketchum
core values, but they express them in quite different ways,"
he says.
   The same culture, perhaps, but it's hard to tell from
looking. Whereas Ketchum's New York offices could easily be
mistaken for an insurance company's, folks at the shop's Los
Angeles and San Francisco offices pride themselves on their
funky wood-beamed offices and blue-jeans mentality. Some
people even commute via skateboard. "There's something about
the freedom of the space and its informality," says Millie
Olson, executive creative director in San Francisco.
   So free, in fact, that Ms. Olson often brings her
six-month-old dalmatian, Molly, to work and lets the dog roam
about the creative department. Copywriters head to a garden
on the roof of the agency to develop what they call "RTA" --
roof top advertising. Here, offbeat ads for Southwestern
Bell's yellow pages and DHL overnight delivery service were
created. The office also made stars out of towns like Luck,
Wisc., and Manhattan, Mont., for the Beef Industry Council.
   In Los Angeles, the shop is staffed with a crew that is
significantly more youthful than the agency's Eastern
operations. The office's creative director, Brent Bouchez, a
lanky guy who came to Ketchum from Chiat/Day/Mojo, is a mere
32 years old. Executives here, including Tim Hart, a
shaggy-haired account man easily mistaken for a creative
executive, are busily readying what will likely be a sexy
campaign for Acura's new NSX sportscar -- a car expected to
cost about $60,000.
   Clearly, it hasn't been easy for the West Coast executives
to create an image that is their own, apart from the
traditional Ketchum mode. "It was certainly easier for
Chiat/Day in New York to establish what it stood for coming
from its strong West Coast office than it has been for us to
establish what we're trying to be . . . coming from the
heritage of solid business-to-business advertising and good
marketing," says Craig Mathiesen, president of the Los
Angeles office.
   His office, at least, is trying to do something about it.
Mr. Mathiesen said a new brochure pitching the office's
successes will run in a California-only edition of The Wall
Street Journal early next month. The brochure, executives at
the shop say, was developed to draw attention to the
differences their office offers in a bid to woo new clients.
The pitch offers "a few words on image from an advertising
agency that's still working on theirs," the brochure says.
   Consultants, though, say the strategy isn't without risk.
"The West Coast is a very different ad market," acknowledges
Bismark's Mr. Weilbacher. Such a new-business campaign can
work, he says, as long as it doesn't detract from the shop's
national new business efforts or contradict the image of the
shop's culture.

   Three Firms Pull TV Ads
                                                                                                       

   Toyota Motor, Anheuser-Busch and International Business
Machines canceled television ads scheduled to air during
broadcasts of a professional golf tournament to be held at an
all-white country club.
   Toyota and IBM said the advertising was pulled from the
ABC and ESPN telecasts of the Professional Golfers
Association tournament because Shoal Creek country club in
Birmingham, Ala., has no black members. Anheuser-Busch didn't
say why it dropped ads scheduled to air during the tournament
Aug. 9 through Aug. 12.
   Officials at Shoal Creek have said that the club doesn't
ban black members and that blacks have been guests there.
   "We're concerned and disappointed about the actions of the
advertisers in light of the PGA's position against
discrimination," said a PGA official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Reacting to the controversy, the PGA announced July 14
that it would in the future consider clubs' membership
policies in picking tournament sites. A specific policy was
to be drawn up.
   The value of the canceled advertising wasn't disclosed.

   CLOROX ACCOUNTS: When it completes its acquisition of the
household products business of American Cyanamid, Clorox said
it plans to reassign ad responsibilities for the Pine-Sol and
Combat brands. The two accounts are currently serviced at
Carafiello Diehl &amp; Associates. Pine-Sol, which bills about
$10 million, will go to Young &amp; Rubicam's San Francisco
office; Combat insecticide, which bills about $5 million,
will be moved to Omnicom's DDB Needham agency in Chicago.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTHWEST AIRLINES: After a review, Southwest Airlines
said it decided to keep the creative portion of its $20
million ad account at GSD&amp;M, Austin, Texas. GSD&amp;M
participated in a review of the creative account that
included a number of other agencies, including Ketchum
Advertising, Ayer, Cramer-Krasselt and Richards Group. Media
buying for Southwest, based in Dallas, will remain with
Camelot Communications of Dallas.

   Cocoa Futures
   Trades Probed

   NEW YORK -- The Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange said it was
investigating what it termed fraudulent trades in cocoa
futures Tuesday.
   Orders to sell as many as 2,000 futures contracts caused
the cocoa market to drop sharply for more than an hour
Tuesday morning. When the orders were found to be of dubious
origin, prices rebounded as the futures contracts were bought
back.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But any traders who lost money as the market whipsawed
stand little chance of recouping their losses, the exchange
said. Exchange officers said these trades were legitimate.
   The September cocoa contract opened Tuesday near Monday's
closing price of $1,259 a ton, then quickly dropped $57 as
big sell orders hit the floor. A cocoa analyst familiar with
the incident said orders to sell 1,500 to 2,000 contracts
were executed in lots of 300 contracts each.
   At 11:15 a.m. EDT, buying started and the market regained
all of its losses. The September contract even rose to a new
daily high of $1,290 a ton before settling at $1,269, up $9.
   James Bowe, senior vice president of the exchange, said
the trades were placed by someone who fraudulently
misrepresented himself in a phone call to the clerk of an
independent floor broker. Mr. Bowe said the exchange
immediately offered to guarantee that the floor broker who
executed the trades would have sufficient funds to cover his
losses.
   "We did that to guarantee the integrity of the market,"
Mr. Bowe said. He declined to give other details, including
the name of the trader or the amount of money involved.
Figuring an average loss of $30 a contract -- about half of
the total price drop, since the trades were executed at
various prices -- the floor broker may have lost about
$600,000.
   Andrea Corcoran, director of the division of trading and
markets for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said
she understands the floor broker "has now accepted
responsibility for the trades, which is entirely appropriate
for a situation like this." She wouldn't comment on whether
the CFTC was conducting its own investigation of the trades.
   Floor brokers said they believe the clerk who accepted the
order was provided with a legitimate account number or that
he recognized the voice of the caller. The phone number given
to the clerk was supposed to be at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York, but when the clerk later called
the number it turned out to be a phone booth in the World
Trade Center.
   A Prudential-Bache spokeswoman said that the trades in
question weren't entered by Prudential-Bache to the
independent floor broker. She added, "We are fully
cooperating with the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange so that
they can expeditiously complete their investigation."
Prudential-Bache is a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America.
   The exchange said that in addition to conducting its own
inquiry and notifying the CFTC, it also notified the U.S.
Attorney in New York.

   Environment:
   Oil Firms, Shippers Seek to Circumvent
   Laws Setting No Liability Limit for Spills

   Shipping and oil executives are devising strategies to
circumvent the biggest threat they face from new oil-spill
legislation -- unlimited liability in case of an accident.
   Already at least one international oil company has been
parking the title to some of its oil in transit with a
willing outside party, a company controlled by fugitive oil
trader Marc Rich in Switzerland. Refiners are also shunning
legal ownership until the oil they buy arrives at their
plants, instead of accepting it in the seller's port as
before.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, some shippers are getting ready to
subdivide their fleets into single-ship companies, each with
minimal assets, to protect the rest of their operations from
any one claim.
   "There will be all kinds of schemes to evade liability,"
says Sharon Tucker, an environmental lawyer and former
Department of Energy investigator who in the 1970s helped
crack traders' ploys to get around government oil-price
controls.
   The proposed federal law, expected to be approved by
Congress soon, sets limits on oil-spill liability. But that's
irrelevant, say officials in the shipping and oil business,
because the bill doesn't pre-empt unlimited liability
statutes on the books in most coastal states, as the
industries had hoped.
   Shipping and oil-industry specialists predict that this
continued possibility of open-ended claims under state laws
will scare away legitimate companies unwilling to risk their
assets each time they ship a load of oil to the U.S. Instead,
tanker owners without the resources to cover cleanup costs or
satisfy damage claims will be attracted to the trade, the
experts contend. The likely results, they say, will be higher
oil prices and more oil spills.
   Many people familiar with the petroleum business expect
"pass-the-cargo" schemes, such as the one involving Mr. Rich,
to proliferate. The goal will be "to transfer ownership {of
the cargo} offshore, outside U.S. limits," says David Booher,
an executive with Transworld Oil U.S.A. Inc., a company
controlled by John Deuss, a major international oil trader.
   In fact, Texas oilman and trader Kyle McAlister says he's
already canvassing U.S. refiners. For at least 10 cents a
barrel, Mr. McAlister says, he is prepared to run the
liability risk for them, buying their oil and holding
possession of it until it reaches their refineries. To do
that and keep his own assets out of reach of U.S. courts,
he'd pack up his wife and three children, liquidate his U.S.
holdings and move to Switzerland.
   "There's money to be made" if the government doesn't plug
the loophole allowing third parties to run interference, says
Mr. McAlister, a multimillionaire who trades at least 40
crude oil cargoes on his own each year.
   Mr. McAlister's propositions are getting a hearing from
tanker and cargo owners who know they can't turn to insurers
anymore. "There is no such thing as unlimited liability
insurance," says Nick Doak, a spokesman for insurance
underwriters at Lloyd's of London. "The U.S. government can
sanction unlimited risk if it wants, but underwriters will
impose their own limits. And if the vessel or cargo owner
wants to run the remainder of the risk himself, fine."
   Some federal officials are concerned about the proposed
law. In a recent letter to Walter B. Jones, congressional
chairman of the Conference Committee on Oil Spill
Legislation, Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner said
he was "deeply troubled" by the pending legislation and added
that it would "have a detrimental effect on the supply and
safety of the transportation of petroleum" to the U.S. An
Energy Department official adds: "We're concerned that with
unlimited liability, major oil and shipping companies won't
send tankers here and the delivery system into certain states
will be disrupted."
   Indeed, at least four barging companies, including units
of Texaco Inc. and Amerada Hess Corp. already have stopped
sending their vessels carrying heavy grades of oil to Maine,
one state with an unlimited liability law. And six shipping
companies now refuse to send their ships to any U.S. port in
anticipation of the new federal law. "I don't want to go to
jail because some {ship's} pilot makes a wrong turn," says
James Hood, president of Teekay Shipping Co., a major crude
carrier on the West Coast that has pulled its 51 tankers out
of the U.S. trade. "I'm taking this seriously."
   Oil companies are trying to distance themselves from the
transport of oil as well. Elf Aquitaine will no longer sell
oil to U.S. refiners on a delivered basis, meaning that it
now relinquishes title to the oil before shipping. The French
oil giant suspended those types of oil sales after the
Norwegian-owned tanker Mega Borg foundered last month in the
Gulf of Mexico with 38.1 million gallons of Elf-owned oil on
board. The oil was bound for a Crown Central Petroleum Corp.
refinery, which had purchased it on a delivered basis.
Although the ship operator bore responsibility for
controlling pollution caused by the accident, Elf, as owner
of the cargo, ended up spending $8 million when the shipper
balked, according to one individual knowledgeable about the
incident.
   Lawmakers and state regulators contend that oilmen and
shippers are bluffing. Maine is being boycotted by barging
companies not because of its longstanding law but because
it's home to Sen. George Mitchell, they say. The senator has
been spearheading the fight against federal preemption of
states' rights. "We've heard them {oilmen and shippers} say
that if they don't get pre-emption, they'll freeze them out
in Maine," says Bill Woodward, senior aide to one of the
principal authors of the oil-spill legislation.
   Laws fostering unlimited liability have been on the books
in some states for years without slowing shipping traffic.
But state governments have become more pugnacious since the
Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska last year. And tanker owners
previously felt that they could always fall back on a
long-established U.S. maritime law allowing a shipper to
petition a court to limit his liability to cargo and vessel
only, says Warren Dean of Intertanko, an organization
representing 85% of the world's shippers. If there isn't any
evidence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, he
explains, the request is usually granted.
   Exxon Corp. attorneys considered invoking this tactic in
the Exxon Valdez case, but decided against the action because
of they feared it would generate an enormous barrage of
negative publicity. Now, however, that maritime law would be
superseded by the new federal legislation.
   Tanker companies aren't abandoning the U.S. market as a
bluff or "out of spite," Mr. Dean maintains. "It's just pure
commercial reality."
   Many of the world's prominent tanker fleets are owned by
families whose entire fortunes ride on them. To protect their
assets, many of these family companies have already
restructured into a series of small companies, each with a
tanker as its only asset. So, if there is a spill or some
other catastrophe involving a ship, the risk is isolated.
"They don't want to put their families at risk," says Capt.
William MacDonald, a ship's master who heads a U.K.-based
marine consulting firm.
   Capt. MacDonald and others paint a bleak picture of higher
charter rates for tankers bound for the U.S., and of a
proliferation of single-ship companies without assets if
unlimited liability becomes the norm here. And because some
regulators have threatened to confiscate ships until cleanup
and damage claims are satisfied, the single-ship companies
plying U.S.bound routes will likely be the oldest and most
expendable tankers in the world fleet.
   Or tankers may carry oil to terminals in the Caribbean,
whence it would be transported to the U.S. on a shuttle run
by shipowners with nothing to lose in the U.S. People in the
industry say at least three Greek shipowners are waiting to
set up such operations if unlimited liability becomes a
reality in the U.S. And each of those owners runs a string of
one-ship companies.

   SEC Votes to Limit
   Money Managers'
   Soft-Dollar Deals

   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a
move likely to change the way pension funds pay some Wall
Street bond commissions, voted to restrict some trading
arrangements used by money managers to buy securities.
   The SEC ruling could alter the business climate on Wall
Street by giving advantages to old-line firms. But many firms
think the ruling is a narrow decision that won't have much
effect on bond trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agency's interpretation focuses on so-called
soft-dollar deals, in which pension funds and others receive
credits from brokerage firms in exchange for trading
commissions. Much like frequent-flier miles, the credits can
be used to pay for research, computer services and client
referrals.
   The SEC said pension-fund trades done through principals,
or firms that trade from their own positions, or trades using
futures aren't covered by a securities-law exemption that
allows broad use of soft dollars.
   If a principal transaction uses soft dollars, the fund
manager could be in violation of Employee Retirement Income
Security Act laws administered by the Labor Department, which
had sought the SEC interpretation.
   Still, the SEC left unanswered the broader questions of
soft-dollar use, which has been criticized by many Wall
Street firms as an area rife with abuses. The SEC said it
will try to tackle those issues later in the year.
   In voting for the restriction, SEC Chairman Richard
Breeden stressed that the decision was a narrow clarification
of rules dealing with specific trades. He contended that it
wouldn't have a broad-based effect on soft-dollar business.
   Frances Bermanzohn, general counsel at the Public
Securities Association and a staunch critic of soft dollars,
applauded the ruling as "promoting fiduciary duties to
protect investors and enhance market liquidity."
   The Labor Department called the SEC move "a wonderful
result for pensioners and retirees." The agency had grown
concerned about the growing use of soft dollars under the
exemption, said David Ball, assistant secretary for the
department's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration.
Some of the costs that should be absorbed by the pension
manager are being passed along to the plan beneficiaries, he
added.
   But several brokerage firms and lawyers objected to the
SEC move. New York-based Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan, a soft-dollar
firm, called the SEC action a "naive" response in favor of
soft-dollar critics. The critics "are trying to leave it to
the regulators to limit their competition," said Stan
Chamberlin, the firm's chairman.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. wrote to the SEC urging that
principal transactions, trading in Nasdaq stocks and the use
of debt-securities trading to pay for debt-securities
research be allowed to continue with protection. Removing the
protection "will significantly impact the flexibility of the
investment manager in obtaining the information necessary to
make informed investment decisions," senior Shearson
officials wrote.
   Moreover, Lee Pickard, a Washington lawyer who represents
soft-dollar clients, argued that the SEC ruling is "likely to
benefit the traditional investment banking firms and may well
reduce competition in the dealer area." Several large
investment banking firms don't engage in soft-dollar
transactions. He added, "It seems to me that the actions of
the commission are likely to have a broader impact than is
assumed. It may well shift business from one segment of the
securities industry to another segment."

   Peanut Lobby Wins
   Battle in Congress
   Over Price Subsidy

   WASHINGTON -- Congressional allies of the nation's peanut
growers defeated a Senate proposal to dismantle the subsidy
system for the crop, and averted a vote on a similar measure
in the House.
   The showdown on peanuts marked one of many challenges to
farm-subsidy programs that the leadership of the Agriculture
committees has managed to thwart as Congress moves toward
enactment of the 1990 farm bill. Both chambers could finish
their work this week on the $54 billion bill, which sets farm
policy and spending levels for the next five years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a crucial vote on subsidy limits, farm-bloc lawmakers
led by Rep. Kika de la Garza (D., Texas) routed a coalition
of urban Democrats and conservative Republicans, who have
been trying -- with scant success -- to overhaul or eliminate
several commodity programs. The House voted 263-159 against a
proposal to deny subsidy payments to farmers earning more
than $100,000 a year, after Mr. de la Garza denounced it as a
"meat-ax approach" to trimming the farm budget.
   Earlier in the day, the Senate rejected the arguments of
Sen. William Roth (R., Del.) and other Northern senators who
maintained that peanut price supports inflict a hidden tax on
consumers in the form of higher prices for peanut butter and
other products. The 57-41 vote was a triumph for the closely
knit peanut-grower groups and for lawmakers from Georgia,
Alabama and other Peanut Belt states, whose lobbying and
vote-swapping overmatched the efforts of consumer advocates
and peanut processors.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Charles Hatcher (D., Ga.) used a
parliamentary maneuver to keep the House from taking up a
similar amendment by Rep. Dick Armey. The Texas Republican, a
leader of the so-called reform coalition, still hopes to
revive his measure before a final vote on the overall bill.
   Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) managed to salvage part of
the coalition's agenda last night when he worked out a
compromise with Rep. Charles Stenholm (D., Texas) that would
gradually reduce support payments to wool and mohair
producers. Mr. Schumer had proposed a $50,000-a-year cap on
payments to individual owners of sheep and goat herds. Under
the agreement approved by voice vote, a $200,000 cap would be
imposed in the 1991 marketing year beginning Feb. 1 and
phased down to $100,000 in 1994.
   In the Senate, the peanut-quota system weathered a fierce
attack. Under the system, which dates from the 1940s, the
government limits the number of peanut farmers who can
produce for the domestic market to 44,000 quota holders. The
government sets the support price for so-called quota peanuts
at $631 a ton, about 50% higher than the world market price
and well above the quota holders' production costs. The
support price for so-called additional peanuts grown by
quotaless farmers is $149 a ton.
   Sen. Roth ridiculed the quota system as "one of the last
vestiges of feudalism in the U.S.," and he estimated it cost
consumers $369 million last year through artificially high
peanut prices. But defenders of the program prevailed with
arguments that it provides a steady supply of peanuts,
stabilizes farm income in the Peanut Belt, and operates at
little cost to taxpayers.
   Sen. Howell Heflin (D., Ala.) told his colleagues that the
return to peanut growers on an 18-ounce jar of peanut butter
varying in price from $1.33 to $3.19 amounts to only 46
cents. Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) contended that peanut
processors would divert any savings from lower-cost peanuts
into marketing and packaging, rather than pass them on to
consumers. "They want to take the money from the peanut
farmers so they can pay for television advertising for Skippy
peanut butter," asserted Mr. Helms.
   The sharpest clash came in the House debate over denying
cash subsidies and other income supports to farmers with an
adjusted gross income of more than $100,000 a year. Messrs.
Schumer and Armey contended that the proposal would affect
only 20,000 "fat-cat farmers" and would save $4.5 billion
over the next five years.
   But farm-bloc lawmakers carried the day, arguing that the
projected savings were greatly overestimated, if not
illusory, and that the proposal would force farmers who
account for 70% of U.S. farm production out of the farm
program. This could result, they warned, in price-depressing
surpluses of grain and other commodities because these
farmers would no longer be subject to government production
controls.
   Last week, the Senate rejected a call for outlawing
subsidies to farmers with gross sales of more than $500,000 a
year.
   Last night, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) and Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) decided against
adding a provision that would have established a mandatory
seafood-inspection program. The proposal would have given the
Agriculture Department the task of inspecting seafood
processors. But Sen. Ted Stevens (R., Alaska) and other
Commerce Committee members strongly favor making the Commerce
Department the lead agency. Messrs. Leahy and Mitchell
decided to take up the inspection plan later as a separate
bill, rather than risk a farm-bill filibuster by Sen.
Stevens.

   TUCSON, Ariz. -- Tucson Electric Power Co. said it has
canceled plans to complete the conversion of a 104.5-megawatt
generating unit to coal-firing capability.
   Irvington Station Unit 3 in Tucson will continue to
operate on natural gas or oil, and modification work to
include coal as an alternative boiler fuel by 1992 has been
halted, the company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In 1981, the U.S. Department of Energy ordered the company
to convert the Irvington Station to coal in accordance with
the Power Plant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978.
Rescinded in 1987, the act would have prohibited power plants
from burning natural gas as a boiler fuel after 1990.
   By not completing the conversion of Unit 3, the company
estimates that it will avoid $25 million in additional
construction expenditures.
   Tucson Electric has been troubled by a stream of
misdirected investments in real estate and financial
services, as well as by apparent excess construction of
generating capacity. In January, cash-flow problems forced
the company to eliminate its quarterly dividend on common
stock for the first time since it went public in 1946.

   Gold Futures Rebound Despite Profit-Taking
   Late in Day; August Contract Rises $4 an Ounce

   NEW YORK -- Gold futures rebounded from Tuesday's setback
and closed firm despite late profit-taking.
   August delivery gold rose $4 an ounce to $372.40 after
trading as high as $375.50. September silver was up 1.5 cents
an ounce at $4.87. October platinum advanced $2.90 an ounce
to $485.80.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gold turned in a particularly solid performance. The
August contract never fell below Tuesday's close; even at the
day's low of $370, it was up $1.60.
   Gold's advance slowed in the afternoon, when the August
contract reached its high for the day. Resistance then
developed and the price slipped.
   In addition to the technical resistance, some selling was
stimulated by a lessening of tensions in the Middle East.
Iraq and Kuwait agreed to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, over
the weekend to resolve their dispute over the amount of oil
that Kuwait is producing and other matters.
   A stronger dollar in the afternoon also contributed to the
weakness, analysts said.
   According to Sharon Ziemian, vice president of Citibank,
New York, the activity for the most part appears to be from
major traders with "deep pockets," with little speculative
participation.
   "This has created a combination of short covering, which
was very evident Monday and has continued, and new buying by
these interests, which has given the market strong underlying
support," Ms. Ziemian said.
   "Speculators may be exercising caution after having seen
lower markets and they are looking for a little longer
follow-through. However, all in all, in view of the limited
amount of news, the market is doing very well."
   The short covering, or the buying back of contracts that
had been sold because traders thought prices would go lower,
continued strongly into Tuesday.
   Figures released yesterday by the Commodity Exchange
showed that the open interest, or the number of outstanding
contracts that remain to be nullified by opposite trades or
satisfied by the delivery of gold, continued to decline as a
result of Tuesday's trading.
   The total open interest in gold declined 3,941 contracts
from Monday to stand at 97,848. The decline in three sessions
this week has caused open interest in gold to drop below that
of the less actively traded silver futures despite a decline
in silver's open interest Tuesday. Silver's total open
interest was 98,101 contracts, down from Monday's 98,426.
   Ken Gettinger, precious metals vice president for Union
Bank of Switzerland, New York, said support for the market
began with buying of gold bullion in Europe and continued
through the day.
   "Gold has been a very active market this week," he said.
"The market has been reflecting the Middle East tensions, a
weaker dollar and anticipation of easier interest rates.
Futures have been helped by technical support after the
August contract rose above $370. Also a contributing factor
has been the weakness in the stock market and in
dollar-denominated assets."
   A very important factor, Mr. Gettinger said, is a
short-term shortage of gold bullion: "Physical supplies in
both London and New York seem to be extremely scarce. The
result has been higher gold interest rates and an upward
pressure on the spot price."
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices closed mixed in light
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Reports that
ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries have already reached a consensus to prop up prices
and rein in production did little to spark buying, because
most traders believe the market has factored in a bullish
outcome of the OPEC meeting under way in Geneva. As an
example of how "headline trading" on OPEC news has given way
to reality, news on Dow Jones International Petroleum Report
that the United Arab Emirates' oil minister said he would
accept a daily production quota of 1.5 million barrels didn't
even budge prices. That level is far below the UAE's recent
production. News before the opening of trading that Kuwait's
oil minister had backed away from insisting on an increased
quota for the fourth quarter also had no effect. Despite the
impending OPEC accords, the market is viewed as fundamentally
weak, with U.S. crude oil inventories about 53 million
barrels above last year's levels.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices for hog and pork belly futures
rallied, rebounding from last week's steep sell-off in
response to increased retail demand for pork products. Pork
belly futures for delivery in August closed up the daily
limit of two cents a pound, aided by good out-of-storage
movement of frozen bellies, said Jerry Abbenhaus, a futures
analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. Figures
released after the close of Tuesday's trading showed that 5.4
million pounds of frozen pork bellies were shipped to
processors from warehouses near Chicago last week. That
figure was lower than the year-earlier shipment of 6,050,000
pounds but was seen as buoying prices because supplies of
frozen pork bellies have declined substantially over the past
year, Mr. Abbenhaus said. August pork belly futures closed at
47.12 cents a pound. Live hog futures prices also gained
ground on news of relatively tight supplies. August hog
futures closed up 1.3 cents at 60.67 cents a pound.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices were higher. The September contract
rose 1.25 cents a pound to $1.2165. Analysts said some
support was due to concern over whether workers at a mine in
Peru would walk out in a labor dispute. One analyst said it
might be a "non-event" because many scheduled strikes in Peru
don't actually occur. Another analyst said a major stumbling
block in the talks between the miners and the company was a
demand for wages to be linked to inflation. Also, the analyst
said, the relatively large open interest in the July futures
contract, which will cease trading tomorrow, may have
contributed some firmness. He also said the rebound in the
stock market yesterday may be reflecting greater confidence
in the economy, which would favor increased demand for
industrial materials such as copper.

   Interco Inc., St. Louis, is telling its bankers that it
doesn't expect to make an interest payment due next week on
its bank debt, according to people familiar with the
company's finances.
   Interco, a footwear and furniture company, said in May
that it might file for bankruptcy protection from creditors
as part of an effort to restructure its $1.9 billion in
debts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Interco said it is holding constructive negotiations with
its banks and bondholders. "We believe it is inappropriate at
this time to comment on any aspect of those talks," the
company added.
   Wilbur Ross, a Rothschild Inc. managing director, who is
advising bondholders, said he doesn't expect that an Interco
default on its $700 million of bank debt will greatly change
the company's position with creditors.
   Mr. Ross added that Interco already has defaulted on
enough of its obligations that creditors could file an
involuntary bankruptcy petition if they wanted to. But "as
long as people feel that debt restructuring talks are making
progress, there's no need for anything precipitous."

   The computer maker said net income for the quarter was $4

Second-quarter revenue increased to $39.6 million from $22.6

public last December because it is taking on heavyweights

   For the six months, Mips reported net of $7.5 million, or

   MNC Is Said to Tentatively Line Up
   Capital Infusion of at Least $200 Million

   Battered by the slumping commercial real estate market,
MNC Financial Corp., a big Baltimore-based regional banking
company, has tentatively lined up a capital infusion of at
least $200 million from an investor group, according to
people familiar with the bank.
   Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., the big New York bank, is
attempting to assemble a $1 billion line of credit for MNC,
the people said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One of the nation's most aggressive real estate lenders,
MNC posted a second-quarter loss of $74.7 million Tuesday as
problem loans more than doubled. The banking company said
then that it is considering the sale of some non-banking
units to reduce its need for short-term debt.
   With $28 billion of assets, MNC is the largest banking
company in the Baltimore-Washington, D.C., area, the latest
region to fall victim to the real estate slump. MNC is the
parent of Maryland National Bank, American Security Bank and
Equitable Bank.
   MNC is under pressure to reduce its borrowings following
the recent downgrading of its debt to non-investment grade,
or junk, status by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   According to an individual close to the bank, MNC's board
has agreed, subject to final terms, to accept a capital
infusion of at least $200 million from an investor group led
by Alfred Lerner.
   The Cleveland investor, who was chairman of Equitable
Bancorp. before its merger with MNC early this year, owns a
8.9% stake in MNC and is a director of the banking company.
   MNC's directors have approved the proposed capital
infusion by Mr. Lerner's group, the individual said.
   Faced with the ratings downgrade, MNC, which relies on the
capital markets for funds to a greater degree than most
regional banks, has quit selling its commercial paper to
raise money.
   As recently as March 31, MNC had $2 billion of its
commercial paper, or short-term IOUs, outstanding. But that
had shrunk to about $126 million as of June 30, a bank
spokesman said. An additional $823 million in other MNC debt
comes due over the next year, he said.
   The MNC spokesman declined to say whether the bank has
arranged alternative credit lines. However, he said MNC
hasn't had to resort to borrowing from the Federal Reserve
System's discount window.
   People familiar with the company said the current cash
shortage exists at the parent holding company. They said
MNC's banking units have been building their cash levels in
recent months and don't presently face a cash problem.
   Top federal banking regulators declined to comment.
   According to Thomson BankWatch, a ratings agency, MNC has
the second-largest exposure to commercial real estate of any
major bank -- 30.9% of all loans -- and posted the
second-highest growth rate in its commercial real estate
portfolio last year, 46.5%.
   Bank analysts say a rapid rise in real estate loans, which
are very profitable in good times but are subject to cyclical
downturns, often is a warning light of possible future
problems.
   With MNC's January merger with Equitable Bancorp., the
banking company's real estate portfolio totals $5.8 billion.
Its nonperforming assets stand at $757 million, or 4.7% of
its $16.4 billion in loans.
   In comments to investors earlier this month, Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said MNC's real estate growth "was not
accompanied by sufficiently strong credit standards. The
combination of aggressive growth and weak underwriting
magnifies the company's asset quality exposure to continued
adjustments in the real estate markets."
   The current quarter could well be a crossroads for MNC.
The federal Comptroller of the Currency is conducting a
targeted exam of MNC's loans, and analysts said a 15% or more
increase in nonperforming loans could imperil its
$1.16-a-share annual dividend.
   Frank Barkocy, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
however, said he expects only modest increases in
nonperforming assets, if any, in the third quarter. "The
third quarter could reflect a return to profitability, albeit
modest," he said.
   One reason MNC is in better shape to ride out its woes
than many banks is that it has a cash cow in the form of its
Delaware credit card bank.

   CALGARY, Alberta -- TransAlta Utilities Corp. said it will
discontinue most operations of its TransAlta Energy Systems
Corp. unit, resulting in a write-off of about 17 million
Canadian dollars (US$14.7 million), or 12.5 Canadian cents a
share.
   TransAlta said it decided that building automation isn't
strategic to the future of its TransAlta Resources Corp.
unit, a holding company through which TransAlta owns
TransAlta Energy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   TransAlta, an electric utility with oil and gas and other
interests, said the writeoff includes TransAlta Energy's
losses so far this year, which total about C$4 million. The
unit, which installs building automation equipment, such as
heating control systems, lost C$6 million last year.
   For the first quarter ended March 31, TransAlta had net
earnings of C$54.1 million, or 30 Canadian cents a share, on
revenue of C$273.3 million.
   TransAlta said Andover, Mass.-based Andover Controls, a
unit of London-based BICC PLC, an engineering, construction,
and power company, agreed to complete all of TransAlta
Energy's current projects, and to honor its other
obligations, including warranties. Andover Controls makes
most of the building automation equipment that TransAlta
Energy has installed.

   TOKYO -- Sumitomo Bank Ltd. said it plans to set up a bank
holding company in the U.S. that will house its American
non-commercial banking activities, specifically the bank's
trust-banking and capital-markets operations.
   The Japanese bank also said it planned to invest about
$320 million in establishing new units involved in leasing,
investment management and securities.

<TEXT>
   In addition, Sumitomo said that each of the three new
units will have a chief operating officer from the U.S. and
that "the bank will minimize the number of Japanese personnel
who will be engaged in the companies' management."
   One of the advantages of a holding company's structure is
that it allows foreign financial institutions to create
separate legal entities, which can offer Americans such
positions as chairman and president.
   Sumitomo said it has applied to Japan's Ministry of
Finance and to the Federal Reserve for approval of its plans.

   Senate Denounces
   Sen. Durenberger
   For His Conduct

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Senate denounced Sen. David Durenberger
for "reprehensible" and "unequivocally unethical" conduct.
   As the Minnesota Republican sat with his arms crossed in
his usual seat in the front row of the chamber, the Senate
upheld the unanimous findings of its six-member, bipartisan
Ethics Committee. Ninety-six senators rose from their seats
to support the committee. Sen. Durenberger, and his Minnesota
GOP colleague, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, voted present. Two
senators were absent for the vote.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The committee concluded that Sen. Durenberger "knowingly
and willingly" violated Senate limits on speaking fees and
gift limits by funneling them through his publisher, Piranha
Press; misled the Senate about his ownership of a Minneapolis
condominium in order to claim $65 a day in reimbursement when
he stayed there; and improperly allowed businesses and
organizations to provide him limousine services while he was
on personal business.
   "I wish there were ambiguity here, but there is none,"
Sen. Howell Heflin (D., Ala.), chairman of the Senate Ethics
Committee, said. "I wish I could find innocence or, at most,
inadvertence or inattention or simple ignorance . . . but I
cannot."
   Sen. Durenberger didn't contest the charges. He told his
colleagues, "It has been a costly education. I have reordered
my personal and professional priorities to be, first, a
better man and, then, a better senator."
   The Senate directed Sen. Durenberger to repay the Senate
$29,050 plus interest and to donate to charity $93,730, minus
taxes he has already paid, in excess honorariums. It also
referred the matter to the Senate Republican caucus, which
could strip the senator of his seniority; Senate Minority
Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) has said he doesn't expect the
caucus to take any action.
   Seven members of the Senate have been censured since the
first recorded case in 1811. One, Democratic Sen. Herman E.
Talmadge of Georgia, was denounced in 1979. Sen. Talmadge
lost his bid for re-election in 1980. Sen. Durenberger, who
has served in the Senate for 12 years, doesn't face
re-election until 1994.
   The last major ethics case in the Senate involved New
Jersey Democrat Harrison A. Williams Jr., who resigned in
1982 as his colleagues were about to oust him for submitting
false expense vouchers and failing to report campaign
contributions.

   Action Industries Inc. said it will report an operating

   The restructuring plan includes a sharp reduction in
inventories and receivables, the sale of certain other
nonproductive assets, curtailment of foreign operations and
the elimination of about 25% of the nearly 250 office jobs at
corporate headquarters, said R. Craig Kirsch, president and
chief executive officer.
   Action will focus on its core business, he said, pulling
back from other activities.
   Action stock rose 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $3 a
share in American Stock Exchange composite trading.

   SEC Approves
   Rule Curtailing
   Program Trades

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Just two days after Monday's stock-market
plunge, the Securities and Exchange Commission reluctantly
approved a rule that would sharply curtail program trading on
volatile days.
   The rule, proposed by the New York Stock Exchange,
probably would have slowed Monday's drop if it had been in
place, said Richard Ketchum, the agency's chief market
watcher. "The slope of the decline picked up" Monday at the
point where the Big Board's restriction would have kicked in,
he said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Still, all four SEC commissioners expressed reservations
about the rule. Moreover, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission worried in a letter to the SEC that the rule "will
decrease the linkage between markets." Nonetheless, the SEC
unanimously voted to allow the Big Board to adopt the pilot
plan for one year.
   The SEC also voted to allow the introduction of a new
product that will enable investors to protect themselves from
market drops. The product, called SuperShares, was designed
by Los Angeles investment firm Leland O'Brien Rubinstein Inc.
to improve on the concept of portfolio insurance -- the now
almost-defunct strategy that Leland O'Brien designed to
protect institutional investors in market declines.
Regulators and others who analyzed the crash concluded that
it helped fuel the 508-point drop by the Dow Jones Industrial
Average in the October 1987 crash.
   SuperShares uses a complicated variation on mutual funds
to enable investors to bet on stock movements. One form of
SuperShares is tied to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index,
to allow investors to benefit from big rises in the stock
market. Another kind uses money-market funds to let investors
benefit from big drops. "We don't know whether this product
is going to be successful or not," said SEC Chairman Richard
Breeden. But the commission decided to offer the choice to
the marketplace.
   The Big Board rule will place severe restrictions on
program trading whenever the Dow Jones Industrial Average
moves up or down 50 or more points in a day. Specifically,
the plan targets index arbitrage, a computerized
program-trading strategy that allows market players to take
advantage of small price differences between a basket of
stocks and a stock-index futures contract. That contract,
traded on a commodity exchange, allows investors to bet on
the movement of a stock basket without owning the stocks.
   Index arbitrage has been blamed for exacerbating sharp
market moves. But the new rule will force traders to wait for
"upticks" in stock prices before completing the stock side of
their transaction in a market falling by more than 50 points.
That means firms would be taking market risk while they are
waiting for stocks to move up. It is expected that many firms
won't do index-arbitrage trades if they can't be assured of
completing the transaction with a rapid-fire trade.
   SEC officials emphasized that the rule wouldn't prohibit
index arbitrage. "Index arbitrage becomes riskier, but it can
be done," Mr. Ketchum said. He suggested that it would induce
program traders to reduce the size of their trades, so they
could take less market risk.
   The Big Board rule would be triggered an average of once a
month, the SEC said. The restriction would be unwound if the
Dow industrials move to within 25 points of the prior day's
closing level. The Big Board first proposed the rule to kick
in after a 35-point move, but revised it after SEC complaints
that it was too restrictive.
   Still, each SEC commissioner in turn expressed concern
that the 50-point level would be reached too frequently and
that placing roadblocks to index arbitrage could add risk to
the markets. The agency's chief economist, Kenneth Lehn, told
the commission that the impact on the futures and options
markets could be dangerous, and recommended the SEC "send the
exchange back to the drawing board" for more economic
analysis.
   Even Mr. Ketchum, the SEC market-regulation director who
advocated approving the pilot program, suggested that he was
concerned about "de-linking the markets."
   But Commissioner Edward Fleischman said the exchange
"should be allowed to make its own mistakes" and learn from
them.

   THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION will allow until
Aug. 22 for comment before granting final approval of
SuperShares, a product designed to give investors protection
from market drops. An article in yesterday's editions didn't
fully explain the agency's action.

   In his new position, Mr. Faxon will report to Diana D.

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
approved legislation allowing the donation of surplus federal
property to non-profit groups working with homeless people.
   Currently, the government grants limited-term leases to
such qualified groups, an arrangement that public-interest
organizations have argued prohibits them from making
long-range plans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Assistant Housing Secretary Anna Kondratas said the
administration welcomed the measure and would use its
regulatory authority to start deeding properties even before
final passage of the measure, which the committee approved by
voice vote.
   Deeding the property to groups dealing with the homeless
will make "a significant difference" in the program because
the lease arrangement currently thwarts those groups from
securing the financing needed to improve the facilities, said
Wendy Adler, of the National Governors' Association.
   The McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 is the
primary federal vehicle for aiding the homeless. But critics
have charged that one of its major programs, the
surplus-property program, has been less effective than it
could be because of government inefficiency and insufficient
information on available properties.
   "There is still no comprehensive federal guidance on how
to obtain federal vacant properties," John Ols, the director
of housing and community development issues of the General
Accounting Office, said last week in testmony before the
committee.

   Latest second-quarter net income included a tax credit of

Ducommun had net income of $602,000, or 18 cents a share, on

   For the first six months of 1990, the company's net income

   The U.K. Department of Trade and Industry gave British

   The decision followed a U.K. Monopolies and Mergers
Commission investigation that found that a British Airways
20% stake in the new unit of Sabena S.A., which is 53%-owned
by the Belgian government, wouldn't be against the public
interest.

   But the Sabena World venture, which also involves KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines taking a 20% stake, continues to face
objections from the European Community. Last month, the EC
Commission said that some aspects of the three-airline accord
could violate EC competition rules and potentially could harm
consumers.
   Sabena World has yet to respond to the commission's
objections, according to Johan Dekker, the unit's chief
executive officer. The company probably will do that next
month, he said, but it doesn't expect to offer to amend the
agreement with the other two carriers.

   NEW YORK -- Sales at the two major auction houses exceeded
$5.5 billion in the 1989-1990 art-auction season, a gain of
about 40% for both houses over the year-earlier period.
   The reporting period covers the traditional art auction
season from September 1989 to August 1990. Because
historically no major auctions are held in August, results
include estimates for minor auctions for that month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite the robust figures, there was some sales weakness
in a few major auctions held in April, May and June. Michael
A. Ainslie, president of Sotheby's Holdings, said there has
been some "stabilization in prices." Art works "fresh to the
market and properly estimated sold well, while those that did
not meet these standards faced greater resistance than in
recent seasons."
   Sotheby's Holdings Inc. of New York said that art auction
sales for the 1989-1990 season totaled $3.2 billion, up from
$2.3 billion in the 1988-1989 season.
   Sales at London-based Christie's International PLC were
$2.4 billion, up 40% from the year-earlier sales season.
   Separately, Sotheby's announced plans to open an office in
Berlin in October.

   Fieldcrest Cannon Inc., citing a 12% decline in sales in
its bed and bath division, posted a second-quarter loss of
$6.1 million, or 58 cents a share, compared with earnings of
$7.7 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The Eden, N.C.-based textile concern said sales in the
most recent quarter fell 8.7%, to $316.3 million from $346.4
million. The company said its results had been further
undermined by the need to curtail mill schedules to reduce
inventory. Additionally, Fieldcrest took a pretax charge of
$1.1 million, or 10 cents a share, following the closing of
its Laurel Hill, N.C., mill.

   Analysts said the results were significantly worse than
expected.
   "It's confirmation of the business losing market share,"
said Deborah Bronston, an analyst with Prudential Bache
Research. Fieldcrest, saddled with high operating costs,
faces stiff competition from Springs Industries Inc. and West
Point-Pepperell Inc., she said.
   For the first half, the company had a net loss of $5.7
million, or 55 cents a share, compared with net income of
$10.7 million, or $1.04 a share, a year earlier. Sales
dropped 8.1% to $590.7 million from $642.7 million.

   ZURICH, Switzerland -- Bank Vontobel &amp; Co. has strongly
advised Jacobs Suchard AG shareholders not to accept the
terms of Philip Morris Cos.' $3.8 billion takeover bid for
the Swiss chocolate and coffee concern. Vontobel claims that
U.S. tax law provides a weapon to push the offer price
higher.
   In a study of the proposed acquisition released yesterday,
Vontobel wrote that unless New York-based Philip Morris
acquires 80% of Suchard's capital it will lose tax benefits
in the U.S. "We estimate that this could mean hundreds of
millions of Swiss francs for Philip Morris," said one of the
report's authors, Rene Weber.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This advice from Vontobel could introduce a new wrinkle in
the takeover. Many other analysts and Swiss banks had
reluctantly recommended that shareholders accept the offer on
the assumption they had no other choice.
   A Philip Morris spokesman in Zurich quoted Luc E.
Vandevelde, vice president of the company's Kraft subsidiary,
as saying "there will be absolutely no changes" in the prices
offered to Suchard shareholders. Mr. Vandevelde has
represented Philip Morris throughout the transaction.
   A Suchard spokesman said it was not his company's job to
comment.

   OPEC Moves Toward Raising Price
   It Seeks for Oil as Much as $2 a Barrel

   GENEVA -- OPEC ministers meeting here moved toward raising
the target price for oil produced by their countries at least
$1 to $2 a barrel from the current $18.
   A rise in the so-called reference price wouldn't
automatically lift world market prices by the amount of the
increase. But as the official goal of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, a higher reference figure
would underscore the group's determination to prop up oil
prices and revenues, which have sagged badly this year. The
boost in the target price would be the first in four years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In hopes of achieving higher prices, OPEC members, who
produce more than 40% of the non-Communist world's crude oil,
would effectively cut back on the combined amount of oil
they're pumping.
   A proposed new production arrangement would set a total
output ceiling for OPEC members of 22.5 million barrels a
day. On paper, that would be 400,000 barrels a day higher
than the current ceiling. But in fact, if honored, such a new
ceiling would mean actual output would drop substantially
because it would cut down on production by some members that
exceed the quotas.
   Specifically, it would bring the United Arab Emirates, a
chronic overproducer, back into the OPEC fold under a higher
quota offered under terms hammered out in Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia, two weeks ago by five Persian Gulf ministers.
   But some major obstacles to a quick agreement still face
the oil ministers as they open the formal part of their
midyear conference today, including a tense disagreement over
oil policy by Iraq and Kuwait.
   Iraq has threatened to use military force against Kuwait
to settle their differences. This rising tension puts two of
OPEC's key Persian Gulf ministers, who were in on the recent
Jiddah meeting, on opposite sides of the price issue here.
The Iraqi minister is now demanding a new reference price of
$25 a barrel while his counterpart from Kuwait wants to hold
it at $18.
   Also, Libya's oil minister, Fawzi A. Shakshuki, supports
the Iraqi minister's call for a $25 benchmark and strongly
objects to other parts of the Jiddah plan. "I was not part of
the Jiddah agreement," he said last night, adding: "If there
is any {quota} increase, Libya should also get an increase."
   While OPEC's bottom line is the price of oil, in many ways
the discussions here over where to set the reference price
are academic unless the cartel's production is brought into
line with demand. Total output of the 13 oil exporters has
soared as high as 24 million barrels a day this year,
contributing to an enormous buildup of petroleum inventories
world-wide and causing the average price of OPEC crude to
drop as low as $14 a barrel.
   Prices have recovered at least $3 a barrel since the
Jiddah meeting, but still remain below the current $18
reference price.
   OPEC economists late yesterday told an informal meeting of
ministers that their overproduction had resulted in an
increase of 184 million barrels in world oil inventories this
year.
   After the meeting, OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said the
report concluded that to eliminate this inventory "overhang"
in the remainder of the year, OPEC production should be held
to 22 million barrels a day.
   An increase in demand for OPEC oil to some 23 million
barrels a day is expected, however, in the year's second
half. So OPEC officials reasoned that strict adherence to
production quotas should hold total OPEC output below that
level, keeping prices firm.
   As a result, most ministers favor a new higher reference
price immediately. Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister,
suggested that "$20 is a good place to start." But whatever
the target price, oil traders here observing the proceedings
questioned whether it could be met if overproducers don't
honor their new pledges to abide by their quotas. To that
end, delegates disclosed that they expect to increase quota
compliance checks if a new ceiling is adopted.
   Past overproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
is the chief reason Iraq has moved tanks and troops to its
border with Kuwait. Iraq has angrily blamed Kuwait and the
emirates for "economic warfare" against it by causing this
year's oil-price fall. The threat of military action because
of that dispute has had a sobering effect on OPEC ministers
here, although the Iraqi and Kuwaiti ministers joked and
laughed with each other during photo sessions yesterday.

   Norfolk Southern Corp. reported second-quarter net income
declined 10%, as year-earlier results were helped by a gain
on the sale of trucking assets.
   The rail and road transportation company reported net for
the quarter of $155.9 million, or 95 cents a share, compared
with $173.7 million, or 99 cents a share, in the 1989
quarter. The Norfolk, Va., company said the year-earlier net
was a record for a second quarter. Revenue edged up to $1.18
billion, a second-quarter record, from $1.17 billion. Most of
the revenue is railway-derived; the company noted a 7.2%
increase in coal-shipment revenue, but a 3.2% drop in
merchandise shipping revenue.

   For the six months, net was down 3.7% to $296.1 million,

Revenue rose 1.4% to $2.32 billion from $2.29 billion.
   The quarter and half results included a $13.6 million gain
from the sale of Norfolk's holding in Trailer Train Co.
Per-share results were better than the dollar amounts
indicated. The company said it is buying back about a million
shares a month under a 20 million-share program authorized
last fall. Shares outstanding total about 162.8 million, an
official said.

   Engelhard Corp. said second-quarter net income rose 20%
largely because of the success of its precious-metals
management business.
   Earnings for the Edison, N.J.-based maker of
specialty-chemical products and engineered materials rose to
$18.2 million, or 41 cents per share, from $15.1 million, or
34 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose
25% to $751.3 million from $603.1 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Orin R. Smith, president and chief executive officer,
attributed the increase primarily to the company's success in
building its industrial business base for precious-metal
materials management services and to favorable conditions in
those metals markets. That business trades in the precious
metals markets for its own account and for
customers'accounts. Together with the engineered-materials
segment, which includes the fabrication of industrial
products using precious metals as raw materials, this
accounts for about 30% of total operating earnings, the
company said.
   Earnings for the first half of 1990 rose 12% to $32.9
million, or 74 cents per share, from $29.5 million, or 66
cents per share. Sales rose 18% to $1.41 billion from $1.19

showed that orders for "big-ticket" factory products declined
a seasonally adjusted 3.2% in June after rising 4.2% in May.
The latest report reveals that manufacturers of cars, home
appliances, industrial machinery and other durable goods are
still hurting.

   Such news tends to stimulate excitement in the bond market
because investors assume that slow growth will eventually
lead to lower inflation and interest rates.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 3/8 points, a
gain of about $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
Short-term Treasury notes and bills, however, ended unchanged
to slightly higher while corporate and mortgage-backed bonds
rose modestly.
   But municipal bonds were top performers yesterday, posting
gains of as much as 5/8 point. Joel Marver, chief
fixed-income analyst at Technical Data Global Markets Group,
said the gains in municipals are a positive sign that the
tone in the broader bond market may be improving.
   "Munis tend to move a little quicker than Treasury bonds,
it's something we're keeping one eye on," he said.
   All bond prices opened higher yesterday in response to the
durable goods report. After the initial flurry of buying
activity died down, the market was lifted again by reports
that Federal Reserve Governor Wayne Angell opposes easing
monetary policy to avoid recession.
   Mr. Angell, who was addressing the American Legislative
Exchange Council in Boston, also said the Fed should "order
its activities so that the interest rates on 30year bonds
would be as low as possible."
   William Sullivan, director of money-market research at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said that Mr. Angell's remarks,
"boosted confidence," in the long end of the bond market by
reinforcing the impression that the Fed still has a resolve
to pursue an anti-inflation policy. In recent weeks, some
investors have worried that the Fed is abandoning the fight
against inflation.
   But the Fed Governor's remarks caused mild confusion for
dealers who participated in the Treasury's record $11.7
billion two-year note auction. Two-year notes, and other
short-term securities, have performed better than long-term
bonds recently due to speculation that the Fed might ease
policy. Many expected that trend to continue and loaded up on
two-year notes at the auction.
   Although dealers said the two-year auction was well bid,
yields for the securities rose slightly after Mr. Angell's
comments hit the news wires.
   The notes were sold at an average yield of 8.07%. That was
the lowest yield at a two-year note auction since 7.71% at
the Dec. 19, 1989 auction and was down from 8.41% at the
previous two-year note auction on June 26. The Treasury
received bids totaling $40.49 billion, including $1.58
billion of noncompetitive tenders.
   Late yesterday, the yield had spurted to 8.10%.
   Steve Ricchuito, chief economist at Barclays De Zoete Wedd
Securities said that Mr. Angell's comments "caused a little
setback," in the short-end of the market.
   The upshot, said Joseph Liro, vice-president and
money-market economist at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. Inc., is that
"dealers who purchased securities at the auction are
underwater."
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury prices were firmer yesterday, although long-term
bonds outperformed short-term issues.
   The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of
102 5/32, up from 101 24/32 late Tuesday. The issue's yield
fell to 8.54% from 8.57%. Meanwhile, the price of the
existing two-year note ended at about 100 15/32 to yield
8.09% compared with 100 14/32 to yield 8.10% on Tueday.
   Treasury-bill rates were mixed. The discount rate on
three-month bills eased slightly to 7.56% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.79% while the rate on six-month
bills rose slightly to 7.46% to yield 7.84%.
   Here are details of yesterday's two-year note auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   The notes are dated July 31 and mature July 31, 1992.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   News that troubled Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association
sold its giant junk-bond portfolio for a slight premium to
its market value buoyed the market for junk bonds,
speculative-grade issues that carry low ratings or no ratings
at all.
   The Beverly Hills, Calif., thrift said it agreed to sell
its junk-bond portfolio to a Canadian investor group for $3
billion. The portfolio was valued at $2.93 billion at the end
of March.
   In reaction to the news, most junk bond prices rose
between 1/8 and 1/4 point.
   Meanwhile, corporate earnings reports helped steer
individual junk-bond issues, driving some higher and pushing
others lower.
   Among the high-yield, high-flyers were junk bonds of Magma
Copper Co., which gained on news of strong second-quarter
earnings and higher copper prices. The company's 16.20%
senior subordinated notes rose 1/2 point to close at 103 1/4.
   The 13.25% senior subordinated debentures of USG Corp.,
the Chicago building manufacturer that reported
stronger-than-expected earnings on Tuesday, chalked up 1/2
point to end at 65 3/4.
   Sharply lower second-quarter earnings caused the 13 5/8%
subordinated notes of Stone Container Corp. to fall 3/8 point
to 101 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended steady to 5/8 point higher.
   Benefiting from a lack of supply, tax-exempts were able to
hold onto positive price levels, the first seen in three
trading days.
   Activity during the session focused on dealer trades, with
a smattering of selling by institutions looking for cash to
fund new purchases, traders said.
   The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issues of 2018
were 1/4 point higher at 99 3/8 to yield 7.24%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities prices ended with modest gains.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
were up 1/8 point at 99 5/8, as were Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues.
   Meanwhile, the primary market continues to see warm
investor response to new issues. Among those issues are the
$1 billion offering from Chrysler Corp.'s Chrysler Auto
Receivables Corp. unit. That issue is backed by retail
installment contracts on new or used autos and light trucks
and was priced Monday.
   Also due to favorable response, the size of two
outstanding real estate mortgage investment conduit offerings
has been boosted.
   Fannie Mae said it has raised the size of the Series
1990-93 Remic offering it priced July 3 to $750 million from
the original amount of $500 million.
   And the Freddie Mac's FHLMC 188 offering also priced
earlier this month was doubled in size to $1 billion,
according to lead underwriter Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   Fannie Mae also announced this session that Salomon
Brothers Inc. has underwritten a new $500 million issue of
Remic securities, backed by 9.5% Fannie Mae mortgage-backed
securities.
   In other primary market news, traders say they expect a
pricing soon through Salomon of $500 million of securities
backed by credit-card receivables in a trust set up by First
Chicago Corp.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds, called gilts, ended sharply
lower yesterday due to a drop in the value of the pound and
concern about inflation.
   The inflation scare was triggered by comments made Tuesday
by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major. He told policy
makers that inflation may be higher in coming months than the
government had hoped.
   His comments raised concern among investors and analysts
that inflation may delay the pound's entry into the exchange
rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. In reaction,
the value of the pound fell to $1.8085, down from $1.8235
late Tuesday in London.
   British bonds fell as much as 3/4 point. The 11.75% bond
due 2003/2007 fell 3/4 to 101 14/32 to yield 11.52% while the
12% note due 1995 fell 13/32 to 99 19/32 to yield 12.11%.
   In Japan, bonds ended stronger as dealers were forced to
buy the securities to cover short positions. In a short sale,
dealers sell borrowed securities and later seek to make a
profit by replacing what was borrowed with cheaper
securities.
   Dealers in Tokyo said the bond market appeared to hit
bottom on Tuesday, and with no new reasons to sell, prices
started rising. The short-covering pushed the market even
higher.
   At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
benchmark No. 119 10-year bond was quoted at a price of 86,
up 0.14 point, to yield 7.415. (When calculated using the
semiannual compound method, the yield was 6.93%, according to
Salomon Brothers Inc.)

   Heard on the Street:
   McDonald's, Its Profit Predictability Shaken,
   Should Add Innovation to Menu, Analysts Say

   CHICAGO -- McDonald's numbers, like its food, have long
been synonymous with predictability.
   For 101 consecutive quarters, the burger behemoth reported
record results. So last Friday, when second-quarter earnings
came in just a penny a share below Wall Street expectations,
it was like getting a Big Mac without the pickle.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ensuing uproar sent the stock plummeting 12% in two
days, helping to trigger Monday morning's slump in the
broader market and whacking $1.6 billion from McDonald's
market value -- just a week after the stock hit a three-year
high of 38 1/2.
   Now, with the stock at 33 1/4, unchanged yesterday, many
analysts are saying that McDonald's needs to be innovative
rather than predictable in battling two years of domestic
sales slippage to discount-minded competitors. Unconvinced
that McDonald's will respond effectively, some analysts are
reducing their earnings estimates and backing away from the
stock.
   McDonald's, for its part, has said that it doesn't plan to
cut overall menu prices, and that it will promote occasional
bargains instead. For example, it announced that the price of
its "Happy Meal" for kids is dropping to $1.99 from about
$2.29.
   Such moves aren't enough to thrill Caroline Levy, a
Shearson Lehman analyst. "They have a major market-share
problem domestically," she says. The analyst switched her
recommendation on McDonald's stock to "sell" from "neutral,"
saying, "The next 12 months are going to be tough."
   A Montgomery Securities analyst, Michael Mueller, says he
is disappointed that McDonald's isn't addressing what he
calls the "core issues. {Though} price-value and consumer
tastes have shifted, . . . they're still assuming their
marketing programs will carry them forward. I think that's
the wrong solution."
   Mr. Mueller, too, went to a "sell" from a "weak hold"
recommendation, after digesting McDonald's latest numbers. "A
lot of the restaurant chains I follow are doing very well,"
he notes. Another concern is the rising cost of opening a
typical McDonald's restaurant in the U.S. Mr. Mueller figures
this is about $1.6 million -- and increasing at a rate that
is much faster than sales.
   While most of the U.S. outlets are operated by
franchisees, the company is putting an increasing amount of
its own money overseas. In the past year, McDonald's reduced
domestic company-operated restaurants by 26, and added 80
outside the U.S.
   Foreign restaurants require more capital and take longer
to pay off, says Robert Renck of R.L. Renck &amp; Co., which does
cash-flow analyses. He advises clients to sell McDonald's
stock, because "we are concerned about the ability of the
company to generate excess cash flow while on a slower growth
track." Mr. Renck admits being surprised to learn that
"despite 25 years of unblemished growth in earnings, the
company has never generated positive corporate cash flow
after capital expenditures." Company officials couldn't be
reached for comment.
   But this overseas activity is what Michigan's treasurer,
Robert Bowman, says gives him "comfort" that McDonald's
continues to represent a good buy. The state holds about 5.3
million shares. "McDonald's is not an American corporation,
it's an international corporation, and we look to the foreign
sales, where it has grown almost 25% a year," Mr. Bowman
says. "We're very bullish on the stock."
   Still, Leslie Steppel, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities, notes that international sales represent only
one-third of the company's business. She has lowered her 1991
profit estimate by a nickel to $2.45 a share, "based on soft
{U.S.} sales trends and the fact that I think it will take
them longer to recover." She is holding to her estimate of
$2.20 for this year, though the quality of the latest
earnings "was much worse than what I was looking for."
   Capital Supervisors Inc., a Chicago-based institutional
investor, recently completed selling most of a 3.3
million-share McDonald's stake, in part because of what Mark
Cremonie, equity manager, calls "all the Eastern-bloc hype"
about U.S. companies striking it rich. "The mindset out there
is that it'll be just like putting up a bunch of McDonald's
in Cleveland," he says. "This is a multidecades process -- if
it ever works out." McDonald's plans to open its first outlet
in East Germany within a few months.
   McDonald's has been such a good bet for so long, some
analysts are reluctant to abandon it now. G. Michael Kennedy
of IDS Financial Services concedes he would like to see
McDonald's give up some profit margin for higher customer
traffic, but adds, "I don't see a big downside risk." He
remains optimistic that the company eventually will come up
with a successful dinner menu.
   A Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood analyst, Richard Pyle,
continues to rate the stock a "buy." He says he is "willing
to ride with it another four quarters without a new product
-- if they have some success with being a little more
promotional."

   ST. LOUIS -- Anheuser-Busch Cos., with a 12% sales growth
reflecting a further increase in the company's dominant
market position, said second-quarter net income grew 10%.
   The brewer had earnings of $257.5 million, or 90 cents a
share, up from $233.7 million, or 82 cents a share. Net
sales, that is, sales after excise taxes, climbed to $2.78
billion from $2.48 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Anheuser-Busch rose $1.125 to $44.125.
   The company's flagship Anheuser-Busch Inc. beer operation
shipped 22.3 million barrels to wholesalers in the latest
period, up 4.3% from the year-ago period and a 2.9% increase
from the first quarter.
   August A. Busch III, chairman and president, said the
volume growth is "primarily attributable" to the company's
introduction of its Bud Dry and Busch Light products. Both
brands were introduced nationally in the first quarter.
   The growth in shipments is a "very strong performance,"
said Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analyst Roy D. Burry,
"particularly in light of the strong performances" by
competitors Adolph Coors Co. and the Miller Brewing unit of
Philip Morris Cos.
   He said Anheuser's earnings increase was despite a three
to four cents a share dilution related to the $1.1 billion
acquisition last year of the Sea World theme park group.
   Anheuser said trade-industry figures show its U.S. beer
market share in the year's first six months increased to
42.9% from 41.9%.
   The company said its can-making unit had "greatly improved
earnings," rebounding from "depressed 1989 levels." In
addition, profit at the Campbell Taggart food operation
gained, reflecting higher volume and improved profit margins
in some lines, the company said.

   MONTREAL -- Minority preferred shareholders of Steinberg
Inc. sued Socanav Inc., asking Quebec's Superior Court to
overturn about 1.2 billion Canadian dollars (US$1.04 billion)
in sales of Steinberg's assets by Socanav in the last year.
   Socanav, which is controlled by the Montreal entrepreneur
Michel Gaucher, acquired the food retailing chain last August
for C$1.33 billion, in a bid backed by the financial muscle
of Quebec's Caisse de Depot et Placement. Caisse de Depot,
the province's powerful pension-fund agency, also is named in
the lawsuit, along with key Socanav executives and Steinberg,
now a unit of Socanav.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suit alleges that the defendants acted without regard
for the interests of Steinberg and its remaining shareholders
when it began selling the company's retailing assets. The
three issues of preferred shares, which weren't acquired by
Socanav, have fallen in value between 12% and 37% since the
acquisition of Steinberg.
   Among the transactions that the shareholders are asking
the court to declare null and void are the agreement to sell
Steinberg's 50% stake in Lantic Sugar Inc. to Toronto-based
Jannock Ltd. for C$110 million, and the proposed sale of 69
Miracle Food Mart stores to Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co.
of Montvale, N.J., for C$235.5 million, announced last week.
   If the court can't overturn the sales, then the plaintiffs
are asking it to order the defendants to pay C$1.2 billion in
damages to Steinberg and C$86.7 million to redeem the
preferred shares outstanding.
   Steinberg and Socanav said in a statement that the action
forms part of litigation previously threatened by the
shareholders, and that they believe the action to be without
merit. Executives couldn't be reached to elaborate.

   Despite declining yields, investors put another $2.4
billion into money market mutual funds in the latest week.
   Assets of 432 taxable funds totaled $384.8 billion at the
close of business Tuesday, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money
Fund Report. The average seven-day compound yield, which
assumes reinvestment of dividends, dipped to 7.88% from 7.95%
-- the lowest since November 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Martha Wittbrodt, editor of the Holliston, Mass.,
newsletter, predicted that yields will continue to slip in
the next few weeks, reflecting the Federal Reserve Board's
recent easing of interest rates. She said the decline in
money fund yields could be a 10th of a percentage point or so
over the next three to four weeks.
   Average yields on taxable funds have been at or just below
8% for most of this year.
   Average maturity of the taxable funds remained the same in
the week ended Tuesday, at 44 days. That is within the range
of the last few months; average maturity has been as short as
29 days and as long as 53 days in recent years. Money funds
invest in such things as short-term Treasury securities,
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and bank
certificates of deposit.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.59% from 7.66%. The average 30-day simple yield
also eased, to 7.65% from 7.66%, and the average 30-day
compound yield dipped to 7.94% from 7.95%.
   Yields on tax-exempt funds also declined. The average
seven-day compound yield of 227 tax-free funds eased to 5.21%
from 5.23%, Donoghue's reported. The latest yield is
equivalent to 7.24% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket
and 7.78% for someone paying 33% in taxes.
   Assets of the tax-exempt funds decreased to $78.8 billion
from $78.9 billion. Average maturity remained at 51 days.

   Enterprise -- The Part-Time Entrepreneur:
   In Summer, Teachers Test Their Entrepreneurial Skills
   ---
   Some Learn Lessons of Their Own
   During Break From the Classroom

   A summertime small-business phenomenon is now in full
swing: the teacher as part-time entrepreneur.
   Few professions produce as many part-time entrepreneurs as
teaching. And the long summer vacation is the time when
thousands put down their chalk and start calculating their
profit margins -- often so they can afford to pick up the
chalk in September.

   Johnny Hamilton, a 42-year-old junior high school teacher
in Monroe, La., loves teaching industrial arts, but his
salary is only $23,000 a year. He says he and his wife, also
a teacher, and their four children could "survive" on their
teaching income alone. But the family would have to forgo a
lot of extras, and the kids wouldn't get to attend dance
class or football camp.
   So, he runs a summertime lawn service. It boosts his
annual income by as much as 25%. And though friends ask why
he doesn't just relax when summer comes, he tells them, "I'm
working to be able to teach next year."
   With three months of vacation, other teachers just crave
something different to do after months in the classroom.
Others just hate being idle.
   Susy Philhours and Virginia Cooper, middle-aged elementary
school teachers in Bowling Green, Ky., wanted something to
fill their summers after their grown children left home. Last
year, they started a part-time, hand-painted apparel
business, called the Two T's Inc. ("T" is for teacher).
They're learning some lessons of their own in real-world
economics.
   At a recent teachers' convention where they exhibited
their wares, they priced their T-shirts at $12 only to find a
competitor's moving faster at $10. They felt their stuff is
"prettier," and worth the higher price. But they met the
rival's price anyway, and sales jumped. "It's a lot different
than teaching your vowels, rules and numbers," allows Ms.
Philhours, who was named Kentucky Elementary Teacher of the
Year for 1990.
   Nobody knows how many teachers transform themselves into
entrepreneurs each year, but educators clearly moonlight more
often than other professionals. Last year, 477,000
elementary, secondary and vocational school teachers ran
their own businesses or worked a second job, say government
surveys. This group accounts for 11.8% of all teachers, a
level nearly twice that of multiple jobholders in the general
working population.
   Many are young, inexperienced teachers with low base
salaries, says another government survey. They make enough in
summer to close the income gap with more experienced peers,
says Sharon Bobbitt, a government statistician.
   For some teachers, a summertime business is a welcome
break from the school grind. Burr Rhodes, a high school
counselor in Hummelstown, Pa., runs a painting business with
two teaching pals. After some school days, he wonders whether
he did anybody any good. But the results of painting, he
says, are "so visible."
   For others, a summer business means security. Susie
Mangus, a 25-year-old teacher in Evergreen, Colo., has worked
as a waitress during the summer since she was a teen-ager.
She's sick of hearing diners complain, but she doesn't know
where to find better employment. "It's real hard to get a
three-month job," she says. Next summer, once she has
completed her masters' degree in teaching, she plans to start
making money at something she has done mostly for fun until
now: running a business selling T-shirts and sweat outfits
that she decorates.
   But teachers find that some businesses don't lend
themselves to being a part-time operation. Jan Bohlin and
Gerald Muto, two mathematics teachers in Topsham, Maine,
started a summertime carpentry business so they could afford
luxuries their teaching salaries wouldn't allow, such as
their own custom-built homes. However, they found the work
wasn't very profitable. They couldn't handle enough volume in
just three months to recoup their insurance, workers'
compensation, equipment and advertising costs.
   Therefore, they decided to run the company year-round.
They hired a supervisor to oversee their projects during
school hours, check on the work after 3 p.m., and sometimes
work until nightfall, while still trying to give their
schoolwork top billing. "Sometimes it's very busy and
sometimes we're very tired," says Mr. Bohlin.
   Not all teachers find owning a business, even part time,
to their liking. Charles Brads, a mathematics teacher in
Clayton, Ohio, used to enjoy the roofing business he started
16 years ago. It helped support his children. He got to work
outside after being cooped up in a classroom. And the neat
look of well-laid rows of shingles appealed to his
mathematical mind.
   Oddly enough, he grew to resent the arithmetic required to
keep tabs on things. He had to squander a day a week on
finances, taxes and other paper work. "That's not my kind of
math," he says. "I enjoy finding the area under a curve, but
I hate adding a long column of figures."
   What's more, now that he is 45, he finds it harder to run
up the ladder. So, he retired from roofing this year; in his
spare time, he is selling mutual funds.
   For some, however, a part-time business becomes a life
raft out of a dead-end career. Dale Eby, an Englewood, Ohio,
resident, says he burned out after running the same
woodworking class, seven days a week, for nine years. He
found, meanwhile, that he liked being his own boss, running a
home-remodeling business during the summer.
   He quit teaching last fall. After a brief stint working
for a construction contractor, he started his own remodeling
company this spring. So far, he's completed $15,000 of work.
And he says the only thing he misses from school is cutting
out at 3.

   Let Military Bands Sing for Their Supper

   Walk into just about any well-stocked record store and in
the "bands and marches" section, you'll find an excellent
selection of recordings by some of the world's finest
military bands. British bands, especially those of the Guards
regiments, are particularly well represented. But also
present are albums by such excellent ensembles as the French
Garde Republicaine, the West German army and even the Belgian
and Danish armies.
   But if you have a yen to hear the U.S. Marine Band play
the marches of their legendary bandmaster John Philip Sousa,
you might have to book a flight to Moscow, where the band was
touring recently. The same goes for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air
Force and Coast Guard bands.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That's because under a law dating back several decades,
Congress specifically forbids American military bands from
making records for commercial sale to the American public.
The few records they do make go to libraries or other
institutions. The law was enacted, apparently, because some
civilian bands feared they would be "undercut" by competition
from the service musicians.
   "As far as I can tell, we are the only nation in the world
that has such a ridiculous law," says Barbu Alim, treasurer
of the American branch of the International Military Music
Society, a civilian organization of military music
afficianados that is pressing to have the law changed. "In my
own collection, I not only have albums from all the British
bands, but also the Bahamas, Surinam, Fiji, you name it.
Everyone, it seems, is anxious to let their military bands be
heard and appreciated world-wide except us."
   The "peace dividend," however, might be coming to the
rescue of deprived military music lovers. Even in the salad
days of the Reagan military buildup, the cost of armed forces
musicians (about $200 million in fiscal 1991) was a subject
of grumbling on Capitol Hill. "Where is the balance in our
peacemaking efforts, when our budget is half that of military
marching band?" fumed then-Peace Corps Director Loret Miller
Ruppe in a fairly typical comment.
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw (R., Fla.), however, has decided that,
instead of complaining, Congress should give the bands a shot
at earning their keep. He has introduced a bill that would
allow the military bands to sell records commercially if they
so choose. Any profit would go toward defraying the cost of
maintaining the bands.
   "{The bill} would not require the bands to sell their
recordings," Mr. Shaw told a congressional hearing on his
bill earlier this month. "The bill stipulates that any
proceeds received from the sale of any of the recordings are
to be credited to applicable military appropriations for the
expenses of the bands. The bill could be amended to allow
other uses of the proceeds, such as service charities or
monuments."
   At the moment, there is no organized opposition to the
Shaw bill, which has received an outpouring of support from
military music enthusiasts as far away as Japan, the
Netherlands and Australia. The American Federation of
Musicians, which has looked with suspicion on the idea for
years, now has many members among the service bands and, for
the moment, has taken no position.
   The Defense Department has not yet expressed a formal
position on the Shaw legislation. "They probably have mixed
feelings," Mr. Alim says. "They would probably like to make
the records, but would have a hard time getting used to
relying on them as part of their means of support."
   John Philip Sousa was the director of the U.S. Marine Band
when it made some of the very first recordings ever for
Thomas Edison in 1890. It seems a shame that today, most
Americans are faced with the choice of hearing the band in
live performance or not at all.

   Technology &amp; Health:
   Tandy Unveils 1000 RL in Latest Bid
   To Stimulate Home-Computer Market

   Again, Tandy Corp. has decided to ask the bewildering
question: Will average American families spend $1,000 or more
to computerize basic household management chores?
   During the past decade, consumers have answered with a
thundering "no." But the prize -- a potentially huge market
-- is tantalizing and yesterday Tandy joined International
Business Machines Corp. in the search for the home computer
user, a road both have taken before with mixed success.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Fort Worth, Texas, retailer's new Tandy 1000 RL is
aimed squarely at computer novices. It features built-in
software designed to guide new users quickly into balancing
their checkbooks, planning menus, taking inventories or
compiling Christmas card lists. "The 1000 RL is so easy to
use that it guarantees success," boasted John V. Roach,
Tandy's chairman.
   But that success may be limited by the machine's price
range, $750 to $1,300 -- a bit pricey for its target users.
In June, analysts applauded IBM politely for its easy-to-use
PS/1 home computer models -- and recalled how completely Big
Blue failed in the home market in 1985 with the PC jr., which
was discontinued after sales of about 500,000 machines.
   Tandy faced a similar reception. "I'm skeptical that
there's an enormous untapped pool of buyers waiting for one
that's easy to use," said William F. Zachmann, president of
Canopus Research.
   But whatever the market's eventual size, Tandy has a
substantial edge in its 7,000 Radio Shack outlets. Before
shipping the 1000 RL, Tandy drilled its retail sales staff to
ensure they could help computer novices use the computer. By
contrast, IBM is testing its distribution in three markets
before shipping the PS/1 to its dealers plus 1,000 Sears
Roebuck, Dillard Department Stores and Dayton Hudson stores
nationwide. "I wouldn't be surprised to see Tandy sell more
home computers than IBM," Mr. Zachman said.
   Tandy also has been working for years on software that
presents a friendly face to the user. Many analysts believe
that the 1000 RL will prove easier to use than IBM's PS/1.
"It's very friendly," said Joe Ann Stahel, president of
StoreBoard/Computer Intelligence, a market-research firm
specializing in computer retail sales. She added that this is
the type of computer she was looking for in 1982 when she
began typing recipes and address lists into the primitive
home computers of that time.
   Despite its software gains, the Tandy machine also will be
scorned by rivals as primitive by today's standards. Both its
microprocessor and its color video technology are dated even
in comparison to the IBM PS/1, which is also more expensive
at its list price of $1,000 to $2,000. For those prices,
consumers can buy machines with twice as much power as the
IBM and Tandy machines.
   But computing power is a moot question if "users have no
idea what to do with it," said Dean Witter Reynolds analyst
Eugene Glazer. "Tandy is trying to revive a product category
that has been dead for a number of years."
   The 1000 RL's home management tasks -- home finances,
homework, and correspondence -- were among the uses that
Tandy held out for its TRS-80 Model 1 in 1978. While Tandy
has been more successful than most in the home market, most
of its sales were to office PC users who wanted to work at
home. Those computer-savvy potential buyers will want more
power than the Tandy 1000 RL offers, said analysts.
   With a black-and-white screen and a single floppy-disk
drive, the 1000 RL sells for $749.90. With a color screen and
a hard-disk drive, the computer sells for $1,299.90. Modems,
necessary to communicate over telephone lines, are extra.

   The sharp drop in stock prices Friday afternoon and Monday
morning may have scared a lot of investors, but not most Wall
Street strategists.
   They're more bullish than they were just three months ago,
when the Dow Jones Industrial Average was some 250 points
lower.

<TEXT>
   Eight of the 10 big brokerage firms in a continuing study
by The Wall Street Journal and Wilshire Associates recommend
that investors keep 50% or more of their portfolios in
stocks. Only four of the 10 firms were that high on stocks at
the start of the second quarter.
   Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. actually raised its recommended
exposure to both stocks and bonds Monday as a result of the
sell-off. Until last week, the General Electric Co. unit had
recommended that investors keep 35% of their money in safe,
short-term investments such as Treasury bills and other cash
equivalents. Now it has slashed cash to 20%, raising stocks
to 50% and bonds to 30%.
   Kidder is the leader for the past 12 months in the
Journal-Wilshire study, which attempts to gauge how investors
would do if they followed brokerage houses' asset-allocation
advice. Asset allocation is the art of carving up the
investment pie, suggesting how big a slice investors should
take of stocks, bonds, cash and other investments. For the 12
months through June, investors who followed Kidder's
allocation advice would have had an estimated gain of 13.7%.
   Kidder strategist Stefan Abrams thinks the stock-market
slide that began last week has ended -- or will end within a
few days. He expects prices to head gradually higher, led by
growth stocks with dependable earnings. He also expects
moderate gains in bonds, with long-term interest rates
dropping to 8% by year end.
   Dean Witter Reynolds Securities Inc., the short-term
winner with an estimated second-quarter gain of 5.9%, isn't
the least bit cowed by the recent market slide. The Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co. unit is sticking with its recommended 85%
allocation to stocks.
   "Inflation is subpar, inflation is going down," says
strategist John Connolly. He expects interest rates to
decline and stock prices to rise relative to per-share
earnings. "If we were to have a big budget deal, all this
would happen even sooner."
   Greg Smith, strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., is more cautious. For the full 42 months the study
covers, his firm, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America, is the leader with an estimated return of 63.1%.
   Now "nervous" is the word he uses to describe his view of
the market. "My modest optimism on this year has been
predicated on the idea that at some point we're going to get
a drop in interest rates," an expectation he's starting to
doubt.
   Still, he thinks stocks and bonds will slightly outperform
cash for the year, and he recommends that investors keep 55%
of their portfolios in stocks. He's betting the Federal
Reserve Board "will put the priority on fighting a
recession." That would mean at least some decline in
short-term rates, helping bonds a little, stocks a bit more.
   Here's a rundown on the other seven brokerage houses in
the study, listed in order of 12-month performance.
                                                                                                       

   SHEARSON LEHMAN: Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. has been the
most consistent performer in the study, ranking second for
all three time periods. Michael Sherman, strategist at the
American Express Co. unit, hasn't changed his recommended
blend (65% stocks, 30% bonds, 5% cash) since late March. In
his opinion, the Dow Jones Industrial Average can hit 3300
this year if the right kind of deficit-reduction agreement is
struck. The deal would have to provide for slicing the
deficit by $50 billion, and restore favorable tax treatment
for capital gains. Mr. Sherman believes that will happen. But
if it doesn't, he thinks stocks and bonds could be in for
rough sledding.
                                                                                                       

   RAYMOND JAMES: Fourth for the 12 months, after Pru-Bache,
Raymond James &amp; Associates recently cut its stock allocation
to 50%. It is worried that the market's advance in the past
couple of months wasn't broad-based, and that consumer
spending is weakening. The St. Petersburg, Fla.-based firm,
never a big fan of bonds, especially dislikes them now
because it thinks the bond markets have already anticipated
easing by the Fed and a deficit-reduction agreement.
   Raymond James is the only firm among the 10 that advises
clients to put some of their portfolios in real estate
(currently 15%). That's a soft market nationwide, but J.
Davenport Mosby, a managing director, says real estate in the
Southeast is "performing very well."
                                                                                                       

   PAINEWEBBER: Edward Kerschner, strategist at PaineWebber
Inc., calls it the "market mambo": Stocks step forward for
two months, then back in the month when corporate earnings
are announced -- October, January, April and now July. But
Mr. Kerschner believes that "we're past the worst of the
earnings comparisons." Starting in the third quarter, he
predicts, many companies will show quarterly earnings above
those of 12 months earlier. He thinks the Dow Jones
industrials could reach 3200 to 3500 within 18 months, given
a budget-deficit pact, some further interest-rate easing and
those improved profit comparisons.
                                                                                                       

   SMITH BARNEY: Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. ranks near
the middle for all periods. William Helman, strategist at the
Primerica Corp. unit, usually advocates a middle-of-the-road
blend (currently 50% in stocks and 35% in bonds). If a
successful deficit-cutting deal is achieved, he thinks stocks
could rise about 10%, and bonds could also rise a bit. He
doesn't see big gains in bonds, however, unless a recession
hits. As for stocks, "performance has been quite mixed and
narrow" he says, with a mere 14 stocks accounting for the

   GOLDMAN SACHS: Eighth for the 12 months, after Dean
Witter, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. is recommending that investors
keep only 35% of their portfolios in stocks. That is the
smallest stock allocation among the 10 firms. Strategist
Steven Einhorn says he doesn't see a big risk in stocks, but
thinks they may decline 5% to 10% over the next few months as
investors get "frustrated" when interest rates fail to
decline. Bonds, he thinks, will neither rise nor fall, but
the interest on them will outpace cash. He is telling
investors to put 55% of their money in bonds, the highest
bond allocation in the group. "Bonds look the best to me
because the stock market has already embedded in its price a
much lower bond yield," he says.
                                                                                                       

   MERRILL LYNCH: Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. ranked ninth for the 12
months and last for the second quarter, mostly because it
liked bonds, which underperformed. But strategist Charles
Clough thinks his balanced blend (currently 50% stocks, 45%
bonds) is on the right track. "It is very unusual for bonds
and stocks to diverge so strongly, when earnings are
decelerating," he says. At this point, he notes, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average would have to get to about 3200 just
to provide a return equal to the interest provided by bonds.
For the stock portion of holdings, he suggests smaller
stocks, which he thinks are due to play catch-up with their
larger brethren.
                                                                                                       

   A.G. EDWARDS: Last-place A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons recommends
that investors keep only 40% of their portfolios in stocks.
That is unchanged from three months ago. Raymond Worseck,
strategist at the St. Louis-based firm, predicts prices will
vacillate near or slightly below current levels. But the firm
has raised its recommended cash level to 25%, while cutting
its recommended bond allocation to 35% from 45% last quarter.
It foresees a rise in long-term interest rates, to 9% or more
by year end. Mr. Worseck thinks a battle over a new Supreme
Court nominee could undermine support for President Bush and
"damage the budget process."

   GM, Chrysler Plan New Retrenchments
   In Face of Falling North American Sales

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp., in
separate moves, announced further retrenchments in the face
of falling North American vehicle sales.
   Chrysler said it will permanently close a small Canadian
Jeep plant in 1992, and consolidate all Jeep production in
Toledo, Ohio. In addition, Chrysler indicated that in two
years it will discontinue two slow-selling midsized models
engineered by Renault S.A. and assembled by Chrysler in
Canada.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, GM said slow sales are forcing it to cut
production of its year-old plastic-bodied APV minivans. The
move will mean 450 workers will be laid off indefinitely from
the recently refurbished APV factory in North Tarrytown, N.Y.
after a three-week long shutdown that begins July 30.
   The plant Chrysler is closing, in Brampton, Ontario,
builds the Jeep Wrangler off-road vehicle. Chrysler's
decision came after state and local governments in Ohio
promised tax breaks and other subsidies valued at about $14.5
million to keep Chrysler's aging Toledo Jeep plant open.
Thus, the Brampton plant became expendable.
   Earlier this year, Chrysler negotiated a new contract with
the United Auto Workers union local in Toledo. The pact
promises to give the auto maker more flexibility in running
the plant in return for a commitment to keep the factory open
until 1997.
   Chrysler said it will move Wrangler production to Toledo
beginning in the summer of 1992. In addition, Chrysler said
it is going ahead with plans to develop a new, small Jeep,
code-named JJ, and may build that vehicle in Toledo, too.
   The JJ's fate has been unclear since June, when Chrysler
canceled a deal to develop the vehicle in a joint venture
with Renault. By laying out its Jeep production strategy now,
Chrysler may be clearing the way for another company,
possibly Fiat S.p.A of Italy, to take Renault's place as a
partner in the project.
   Chrysler officials refused to comment yesterday on
speculation that Fiat and Chrysler are preparing to broaden
their ties with the JJ deal as a starting point.
   However, Chrysler's announcement indicated it is preparing
to sever more of its ties to Renault. Chrysler said that
beginning in mid-1992, it plans to build a new line of
midsized and large cars, code-named LH/LX, in the Bramalea,
Ontario, plant that currently builds the Renault-engineered
Eagle Premier and Dodge Monaco. No new manufacturing site was
announced for the Premier and Monaco, indicating that those
models will be discontinued.
   Under agreements with Renault, Chrysler likely will pay
the French auto maker as much as $200 million in penalties
related to the slow sales of the cars, a Chrysler spokesman
said.
   Meanwhile, GM's decision to cut production of its new
minivans is an embarrassing setback for a product the company
touted as the forerunner of a broad product renaissance.
   But GM's effort to leapfrog Chrysler's popular minivans
with a radical design apparently didn't impress consumers,
who found the vehicles expensive, and lacking in cargo room
and engine power.
   Dealers said they weren't surprised by news of the
layoffs. "Sales have been OK but nothing great," said Glen
Cain, general sales manager of Desmond Pontiac in Cincinnati.
Even with a $1,500 rebate, the dealership has been selling
only two or three Pontiac Trans Sport minivans a month.
   So far this model year, GM has sold only 74,337 of the APV
vans, just over half of the 141,263 vehicles produced since
the start of production last summer.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Chrysler's shares closed at $15.875, unchanged,
while GM's closed at $47.625, down 25 cents.

   Law:
   Store Is Kept
   As Defendant
   In Tobacco Suit

   BOSTON -- The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court threw
out part of a tobacco-liability lawsuit against Philip Morris
Cos. But in a potentially precedent-setting move, the court
allowed plaintiffs to name as a defendant the retail store
that allegedly sold the company's cigarettes to minors.
   The plaintiffs claimed Philip Morris should be liable for
injuries sustained by two minors who bought cigarettes at a
chain of convenience stores. The high court, in granting
summary judgment in favor of Philip Morris, dismissed claims
that the tobacco company should be held liable for the
selling of its cigarettes to minors by convenience stores.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the court allowed the plaintiffs to pursue their
claims that the product caused injury -- in this case
nicotine addiction -- because it was "defective" and that
Philip Morris breached an implied warranty that its products
were safe.
   The court didn't raise issue with the naming of Store 24
Inc., the convenience-store chain, as a co-defendant in the
case, although no retailer has ever been held liable in such
a case before, according to legal experts.
   "I think the effect of this is there will be cases brought
against retailers all over. They will now be held accountable
and I think they're going to be in big trouble," said Edward
Greer, attorney for the plaintiffs, Theresa Kyte and Sean
Cann. The suit says the plaintiffs began buying cigarettes at
12 and 15 years old, respectively.
   Mr. Greer said the plaintiffs plan to pursue the remaining
claims against Philip Morris.
   He added that the charge of defect in the cigarettes is
based on, among other things, their high level of nicotine.
   Hadrian R. Katz, an attorney for New York-based Philip
Morris, said he was "very pleased" with the ruling. He
maintained that the court's decision effectively eliminated
the plaintiffs' case against Philip Morris.
   Several previous liability cases against tobacco companies
have been defeated or overturned on appeal. This case is an
important precedent because it is "putting both retailers and
manufacturers on notice that it is not permissible to sell a
lethal drug illegally," asserted Brad Krevor, executive
director of the Group Against Smoking Pollution, or GASP, a
Boston-based advocacy group.
   Mr. Greer said "no one had ever sued a retailer before" in
a tobacco-liability case. He said the ruling didn't exempt
Store 24 from liability, so "when we go to trial, Store 24"
will be a defendant.
   The Massachusetts' ruling may have wider impact as courts
in other states look outside their own borders for precedents
set elsewhere.
   Officials of Store 24, based in Waltham, Mass., couldn't
be reached for comment.
   In its ruling, the Massachusetts court stated that because
"Philip Morris has no control over Store 24 or other
retailers," among other reasons, the cigarette maker hadn't
conspired with the retailer to sell its products illegally to
minors, as the plaintiffs charged.
   In their suit, the plaintiffs' families allege that one of
their children, Theresa Kyte, hasn't been able to stop
smoking Philip Morris cigarettes after six years despite many
attempts to quit. The families charge that Sean Cann, now 20,
also hasn't been able to kick the habit. They further allege
that the minors repeatedly purchased Philip Morris's Marlboro
and Parliament brands at Store 24 convenience stores in
violation of a statute prohibiting sale of tobacco to minors.
   Said Mr. Krevor of GASP: "There are 100 million teen-agers
who become smokers everyday. Invariably, cigarettes are
obtained illegally. The laws against it are not enforced."
This case, he said, could "put teeth in the laws that protect
teens."

   Rohm &amp; Haas Study
   Shows Tie From DDT
   To Pancreatic Cancer

   PHILADELPHIA -- Rohm &amp; Haas Co. disclosed that a study at
its chemicals plant here showed a statistical correlation
between pancreas cancer in workers and exposure to the
pesticide DDT.
   The chemicals company emphasized, however, that the
finding was preliminary and didn't by itself establish a
cause-and-effect relationship between the pesticide and the
cancer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The study is part of a years-long effort by Rohm &amp; Haas to
track the health of some 6,000 workers at the plant. In 1987,
the company noted the incidence of pancreatic cancer at the
plant was somewhat higher than what would be expected in the
general population. At the time, however, the company
couldn't link the observation with any products or production
processes.
   "There are no previous studies that indicate DDT is
associated with pancreas cancer in humans," Phillip Lewis,
the company's medical director said in a statement yesterday.
   The study looked at the 28 cases of pancreas cancer among
workers at the plant between 1948 and 1971, all of whom have
since died. Eleven of those workers had handled DDT and
related products.
   "We see clear association between pancreas cancer and DDT
exposure," David Garabrant, director of occupational medicine
at the University of Michigan, said in an interview.
   Dr. Garabrant, who conducted the study, said there is less
than a 3% possibility that the statistical significance of
the association was due entirely to chance, even after
controlling for such factors as which of the workers were
smokers.
   Rohm &amp; Haas stopped making DDT-related products years ago,
and DDT is no longer made anywhere in the U.S., according to
a spokesman at the Environmental Protection Agency.
