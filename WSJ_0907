   White House Will Try to Curb Soviet
   Space Trade, Help Boost Oil Production

   WASHINGTON -- The White House said it will try to restrict
sharply the Soviet Union's commercial space launch business,
but the Commerce Department offered to help the Soviets
increase their oil production.
   The separate and seemingly contradictory moves reflect the
administration's ambivalence about aiding economic
development in the Soviet Union in the wake of the Cold War.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The administration, which only two weeks ago for the first
time approved a plan in which Soviet rockets would be used to
launch Western satellites, issued a statement spelling out
its commercial space policy. The policy would allow Moscow to
sell rockets, but prevent it from managing actual launches.
   In coming negotiations with Moscow, the U.S. will insist
that the Soviets drop plans to launch Western commercial
satellites from Soviet launch pads; instead, Washington will
require that Soviet rockets be launched by westerners from a
single site outside the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets also would have to agree to requirements aimed
at preventing them from obtaining the technology used in the
satellites it launches. Details weren't spelled out in the
declassified version of the space policy that was made
available to the public, though.
   Further, a White House official said the administration
would set a "goal" of requiring the Soviets to sell their
launch services at market prices.
   The U.S. believes it has a strong hand in negotiating
tough conditions on Soviet launches because Washington must
give its approval for the launch of satellites using
U.S.-made parts. Nearly all communications satellites use
such parts. "We have an historic opportunity to cut a deal
{because} the Soviets are so eager to enter the market," said
a White House official.
   Frank Gaffney, president of the Center for Security
Policy, a conservative Washington think-tank, said the policy
would hurt U.S. rocket companies, which already face tough
competition from Arianespace, the French rocket firm. "I
wouldn't do anything to facilitate the Soviets' getting into
the market," Mr. Gaffney said. "It's a real cannard to
suggest that there's any way to insure {Soviet} services are
fairly priced."
   The administration plan would limit Soviet launches to a
proposed space port in Cape York, Australia, which would be
operated by USBI Co., a subsidiary of United Technologies
Corp. A spokeswoman for USBI, noting that the White House two
weeks ago endorsed its plan to use Soviet rockets to launch
satellites from the site, said the company expects the State
Department to issue an export license allowing it to run the
space port within a few weeks. USBI said the first launches
using Soviet rockets would take place in 1995 or 1996.
   An administration official said that the Soviets objected
during preliminary talks to the proposed U.S. restrictions.
The U.S. plans talks concerning the Soviet Union and other
space issues with the European Space Agency starting Sept.
24. Currently, several U.S. companies and Arianespace control
nearly all the world's commercial launch business.
   At the same time the White House was talking tough about
launch business, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the
U.S. is offering the Soviets technology that can help them
reverse the decline in their oil production. He said the
know-how can be provided by a number of energy-related
companies whose chief executive officers he is taking to the
Soviet Union tomorrow.
   "We're doing this for the benefit of both countries," Mr.
Mosbacher told reporters here.
   For instance, the commerce secretary said U.S. experience
in "fracturing" -- injecting certain chemicals into an oil
reservoir to increase its porosity and flow -- could be
applied to Soviet fields with potentially quick results.
   The American Petroleum Institute reports that Soviet oil
production has declined from 11.7 million barrels a day in
1987 to about 11.2 million barrels a day this year as a
result of inadequate investment and oil-field exhaustion.
   Among the energy firms represented in the U.S. business
delegation are Chevron Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co., Texaco
Inc., and Dresser Industries Inc.

   SEOUL, South Korea -- Senior officials from the Group of
Seven industrialized countries will meet in Paris Monday and
Tuesday to discuss the dollar's recent decline and to review
developments in the world economy, a U.S. Treasury official
said.
   The meeting comes at a time when the economic slowdown in
the U.S. has pushed the value of the dollar down sharply
against foreign currencies. The dollar-yen exchange rate, for
instance, is at its lowest level this year. The officials
will have to decide whether any action is needed to stem the
dollar's decline.

   Such a gathering of the G-7 deputies is usually held prior
to the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank, which this year are scheduled to take place in
Washington in late September.
   The G-7 officials also will attend so-called "working
party three" meetings of the Paris-based Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 24 rich
nations, the Treasury official said. The OECD working group
meets regularly to discuss the international economy.
   During the two sets of Paris meetings, officials are
expected to review the impact of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait on oil prices and other recent economic developments.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is here leading a U.S.
delegation on a whistlestop to raise contributions in support
of the American-led military effort in the Persian Gulf and
for Mideast countries -- particularly Egypt, Jordan and
Turkey -- whose economies have been badly harmed by the
Persian Gulf crisis. Western officials say the United Nations
trade embargo against Iraq will be more effective if those
three countries get $3.5 billion of economic assistance.
   The G-7 countries are the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada.

   U.K.'s Farnborough Air Show Is Hit
   Despite Worries About Defense Cuts

   FARNBOROUGH, England -- Despite worries about the Mideast,
shrinking defense budgets and a possible U.S. recession, the
Farnborough Air Show nevertheless is a hit, as usual.
   Nearly 800 exhibitors, from AABE Fabrieken to Carl Zeiss,
are occupying record amounts of space at the biennial show,
which runs through Sunday at this airfield southwest of
London. Harrier jump jets and MiG-29 fighters are thrilling
the crowds. Huge aircraft orders are being announced, and
millions of pounds are being spent on catering in the posh
hospitality chalets where the backslapping and bartering
occur.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "But this Iraqi business has affected the number of VIP
visitors," concedes Dan Honley, spokesman for the Society of
British Aerospace Companies, the show's organizer. "Airline
people are here in force, but the defense procurement people
from the Middle East are down. They don't want to leave their
operations rooms."
   Undertones of concern are hard to miss. General Electric
Co., the U.S. engine maker, concedes that it is facing
cutbacks in its military programs. Roland Smith, the chairman
of British Aerospace PLC, allows as how the shape of the
defense industry is being re-examined in light of the Gulf
crisis. Officials of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
say the Mideast situation and fears of recession are causing
some airlines to hang back on ordering.
   But Daniel M. Tellep, chairman of U.S. defense contractor
Lockheed Corp., is looking on the bright side, despite world
overcapacity for fighter-aircraft production. "The Mideast
thing has certainly shown that we need airlift," he says.
"And we will continue to rely on our strategic deterrent."
   Here's what's up at the show:
                                                                                                       

   Explosive lost-and-found: Security is tighter than usual
at this year's show. Officials say undercover agents, sniffer
dogs and "several hundred" Ministry of Defense police are
patrolling, guided by intelligence reports from Scotland Yard
and foreign governments. Briefcases are routinely checked at
chalet entrances and the undercarriages of cars are inspected
on the way in. Woe to visitors who turn their backs on their
bags; police will blow them up in short order. A salesman
lost his samples that way earlier this week.
                                                                                                       

   Live demonstrations: Farnborough may be big and
well-known, but the newish Dubai Air Show, the next of which
is scheduled for Jan. 27-31, will offer manufacturers the
chance to really strut their stuff. The United Arab Emirates
Ministry of Defense will open a military base for live
demonstrations of missiles, tanks, armored personnel carriers
and the like. Organizers say the expanded show already has
attracted 400 exhibitors from 40 countries. "Manufacturers
are crowding in," says a spokesman for the show. Due to the
Gulf situation, "there is a major rush to get in."
                                                                                                       

   Hungarian Generosity: Responding to pleas from Britain's
Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund, Hungary's air force donated
a mothballed MiG-21 PF fighter to the charity for its Battle
of Britain Auction next Thursday. Also to be auctioned to
raise money for RAF widows and orphans are a 1909 Bleriot
biplane, rides on Spitfires and World War II uniforms. The
Hungarian MiG was to be handed over to the U.K. air force
yesterday at the air show.
                                                                                                       

   Boys at play: The Rediffusion Simulation stand at the show
is crowded, but not necessarily with people interesting in
buying a jetliner simulator. Men in suits and ties line up
each day to "fly" the Boeing 737-300.
                                                                                                       

   Invisible Stealth: There had been much speculation that
the U.S. Air Force would trot out one of its radar-eluding
F-117A Stealth fighters. But no luck, even though the sleek
black bird has been displayed at other air shows. But builder
Lockheed, back after an eight-year absence, offers visitors
the next best thing -- black plastic Stealth lapel pins.
                                                                                                       

   Magnetic attraction: Speaking of giveaways, Airbus
Industrie came up with a novel gift -- a set of refrigerator
magnets in the shapes and colors of all its aircraft.
                                                                                                       

   Profit prophets: Margaret Thatcher, visiting the Airbus
pavilion, got the good news from Airbus Managing Director
Jean Pierson that the European jetliner consortium is poised
to make its first profit ever this year. The prime minister
tartly replied, "It's about time, too." British Aerospace
owns 20% of largely government-financed Airbus.
                                                                                                       

   Sexual equality: For the first time in 29 Farnborough
shows, two female pilots are participating in the flying
display. One is Natalya Sergeeva, a young Russian who pilots
a Sukhoi Su-26MX aerobatic plane. Ms. Sergeeva, the current
women's world aerobatic champion, wins gasps of approval from
the knowledgeable, critical -- and mostly male -- audience
for her speedy, precise flips and loops.
                                                                                                       

   Supersonic washers: Along with his colleagues, Boris
Rakitin, chief designer of the Sukhoi Design Bureau in
Moscow, has had a hand in the design of a number of
impressive Soviet attack planes, including the Su-27 fighter
that wows the crowds here every afternoon. But the Soviet
defense industry, like its counterparts elsewhere, is
changing its focus. Mr. Rakitin says he and his co-workers
are being required to design not only small, turboprop planes
for civilian use, but also washing machines. "It's not so
easy to make a good washing machine," he says. "There are the
hydrodynamic processes. And you have to get the dirt to
separate from the clothes."
                                                                                                       

   Running with the herd: Despite skyrocketing jet kerosene
prices, the fuel-efficient propfan engine is a nonstarter.
General Electric of the U.S., one of the leading developers
of the technology, just couldn't drum up airline interest
when fuel cost 60 cents a gallon, says Robert J. Conboy, a GE
executive involved with the project. Airlines were afraid to
be different, he says, and they figured that if they ordered
what everybody else was buying they would all be in the same
boat even if prices did go up. Now that fuel is at $1 a
gallon and rising, everybody's already ordered planes
outfitted with conventional jet engines. "If we had stayed
the course, the engine would have been certified this year,"
says Mr. Conboy. "We would have been heroes." And airlines
would have cut fuel bills by 30% to 40% on propfan-powered
planes.
                                                                                                       

   Missed opportunity: A search throughout the show's vast
exhibit halls turns up nary a maker of gas masks. Somewhere,
someone must be kicking himself.

   Daiwa Appoints John Carlson as Head
   Of Asset-Backed Securities Unit in U.S.

   The U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Daiwa Securities Co. said
it named John H. Carlson, former president and chief
executive of Security Pacific Corp.'s securities unit, as an
executive vice president and head of a new asset-backed
securities unit.
   Asset-backed securities are fixed-income securities whose
principal and interest payments are supported by assets such
as mortgages and credit cards.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the past few years, the market has grown at breakneck
speed, particularly as commercial banks and finance companies
have sought to unload assets to profit quickly from loans
they have written, free up funds for other uses and meet new
international capital guidelines. The mortgage-backed
securities market totals more than $800 billion. By the end
of last year, the global market for non-mortgage asset-backed
securities had grown to $62 billion from a negligible amount
in 1985, according to IDD Information Services.
   Saying that Mr. Carlson was always his prime candidate for
the asset-securitization job, Stephen W. Bradley, co-head of
Daiwa's capital markets operations, added, "John has intimate
knowledge of the product, from the origination point through
the structuring and analytical stages to actual sales."
   Mr. Carlson, 40 years old, said he enjoyed working at
Security Pacific, which he joined in 1987 from Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. "However," he said, "my background is in the securities
business; I came to SecPac in anticipation of significant
Glass-Steagall reform which hasn't materialized, and Daiwa is
a global securities firm." For years, big money-center banks
have tried to persuade Congress to abandon or change the
Glass-Steagall Act separating commercial and investment
banking.
   At Security Pacific, Mr. Carlson was jointly responsible
for a unit with $100 million in capital and more than $300
million in annual revenue. His unit also co-managed the
bank's first residential collateralized mortgage obligation
and a $750 million credit-card-backed transaction.
   Mr. Carlson said he was attracted by the chance to work
for Mr. Bradley, with whom he had worked at Merrill Lynch,
and by Daiwa's reputation. "My intent is to develop an
asset-securitization business leveraging off Daiwa's strong
reputation and market share in Europe and the Far East," he
said.
   He said he plans to begin originating asset-backed
securities both in the U.S. and overseas as well as using
securitization techniques in helping Daiwa's corporate
clients to restructure their balance sheets by reducing their
debt-service payments.
   In jumping into asset-backed securities, Daiwa, to some
extent, is playing catch-up with big U.S. firms. While Daiwa
has distributed these securities and advised clients in the
U.S., Europe and Japan on issuing them, it hasn't yet
originated any.
   In Mr. Carlson, Daiwa is hiring someone with an eclectic
background that includes graduate studies in meteorology,
competitive sailing and a bit of entrepreneurship.
   He nearly completed a doctorate in meteorology at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "I wrote seven of 10
chapters on the genesis and persistence of droughts in the
continental U.S. and left for the Street," he said. At MIT,
Mr. Carlson sold long-term weather forecasts to commodity
firms and a "permafrost model to the U.S. Army for
cold-regions research engineering laboratories." That, he
added, was "to keep from starving in graduate school."
   An avid sailor, Mr. Carlson recalls a race from Bermuda to
Marblehead, Mass., in which his boat, after losing its
drinking water, confronted 20-foot waves and 40-knot winds.
"It was a good preparation for Wall Street," he said. "It was
when I was a kid and didn't know any better."

   Standard Brands Paint Co. reported a net loss for the
fiscal second quarter ended July 29, and announced the
closing of 19 Texas and California stores in order to improve
its financial position.
   The paint and home-supplies retailer posted a quarterly
net loss of $3.7 million, or 75 cents a share, versus net
income of $1.9 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales fell 8.7% to $79.9 million from $87.5 million in the
prior-year quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The results include a one-time restructuring charge of
$4.7 million, in addition to a $1 million allowance for
losses from discontinued operations. The company, based in
Torrance, Calif., closed 16 stores in Dallas, Houston, and
San Antonio, Texas, and one distribution facility, as well as
three California stores in Merced, Chico and Redding.
   For the six months, Standard Brands reported a net loss of
$4.9 million, or $1 a share, versus net income of $3.5
million or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 6.4%
to $152.6 million from $163 million a year ago.
   Stuart D. Buchalter, chief executive officer, said the
closed Texas properties have an estimated value of $20
million, and proceeds from their sale will be used to pare
down Standard Brand's long term debt of $150 million. The
company still plans to open eight stores in California,
Nevada and Arizona over the next year. It also plans to open
three branches of its Art Stores in California.

   Iraq May Owe
   Italian Firms Total
   Of $11.89 Billion

   ROME -- Italian companies' debt exposure to Iraq could
total as much as 14 trillion lire ($11.89 billion), among the
highest in the world, the Foreign Trade Ministry said.
   About half of that figure represents the debt exposure of
SACE, Italy's export-credit guarantee agency, state-owned
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro and Cantieri Navali Italiani
S.p.A., known as Fincantieri. The latter is part of Istituto
per la Ricostruzione Industriale, or IRI, Italy's sprawling
state holding company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We are surely among the countries most exposed to the
Saddam regime, but that fact does not restrict the (Italian)
government in any way. In times like these, political
interests prevail over economic ones," Italian Foreign Trade
Minister Renato Ruggiero told participants at an Aspen
Institute conference last week in Venice.
   SACE stands to lose $1.87 billion, while BNL is owed as
much as $2.8 billion, and Fincantieri $1.32 billion.
   SACE's exposure is in potential insurance claims. A
spokesman said that almost all the claims materialize, if at
all, in two to six years.
   BNL's credits largely are the result of loans in the form
of letters of credit issued from its Atlanta, Ga., branch
that weren't authorized by the head office.
   Fincantieri's credits stem from a 1980 order to provide
Iraq with a fleet of 11 warships -- one logistical-support
ship, four frigates and six corvettes, a company spokesman
said. Fincantieri, which is based in Trieste, subcontracted
much of the work to other companies.
   Fincantieri shared 61% of the value of the 1980 contract
with Selenia-Industrie Elettroniche Associate S.p.A. and
Elettronica San Giorgio Elsag S.p.A., both of which also are
members of the IRI group. Fincantieri subcontracted 28% to
Oto Melara S.p.A. and Breda Meccanica Bresciana S.p.A., both
units of state holding company Ente Partecipa zioni &amp;
Finanziamento Industria Manifatturiera, known as Efim.
   Fiat Aviazione S.p.A. and several other private concerns
were awarded the rest of the contract.
   In 1986, Iraq paid $1.32 billion -- about half the
contractual amount -- for three ships.
   After the end of the Iran-Iraq war, Rome and Baghdad
reached an agreement in 1989 on delivery of all the ships.
But partly for bureaucratic reasons, one still sits in the
port of Alexandria, Egypt, while the other 10 are in the
Italian port of La Spezia.
   So far, the Fincantieri spokesman said, the cost of
maintenance of the ships and lost interest on the balance
have reached L150 billion.

   If He Fails, They Will No Doubt

   Forget tax credits and subsidized loans. In Portsmouth,
Ohio, where about 9.5% of the 22,400 residents are out of
work, the mayor claims he has a new answer to economic
revitalization: forgiveness.
   Forgive thy neighbors. Forgive thyself. And perhaps most
important, says Mayor Franklin T. Gerlach, forgive the major
steel and shoe manufacturers whose departure more than a
decade ago put Portsmouth on the road to hard times.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "If I have ill will against you, it's just like I handcuff
myself to you. Everywhere I go, I drag you with me," Mr.
Gerlach says. "I get ulcers. Until I can make up my mind to
forgive that person, or forgive myself, whichever it may be,
then I'm not free to go forward."
   If Portsmouth shrugs off the burden of its depressed past,
it could be destined to be a future center for medicine,
tourism and education, Mr. Gerlach predicts.
   But some are skeptical. "I think it's pretty stupid,"
fast-food worker Brian Bender says of the forgiveness
campaign. "I think what we need are some big businesses down
here because downtown is shot."
   To prod his citizens toward the belief that forgiveness is
the route to prosperity, Mr. Gerlach has launched a
full-blown media campaign. Billboards about town tout
forgiveness as the "key to a prosperous Portsmouth";
businessmen have written editorials in the local press; and
preachers have plied their flocks with sermons on the
subject.
   For an added touch, Mr. Gerlach, a lawyer who owns three
Rolls-Royces, struts about town in a powder-blue mayoral
sash: It's a symbol, he says, that fun times are ahead. (He
only wears it to ceremonies, he says.)
   But symbols and words aren't enough. To help speed his
town toward the future, Mr. Gerlach persuaded the Mississippi
Queen river boat to stop in Portsmouth during its trek up the
Ohio River. Wearing his sash and a coat with full tails to
greet the arriving tourists, the mayor kissed all the ladies
as they got off the boat, pressed the flesh with the men and,
in so doing, stumbled across a specialty-steel manufacturer
who might want to move to town.
   So far, however, no businesses have made firm commitments
to move in. But the mayor insists that the forgiveness
campaign is working. Citizens are laughing more, he says.
And, he reports, one divorced dry cleaner is considering
forgiving her former husband and remarrying him.

   SAO PAULO, Brazil -- The state-owned airline, Viacao Aerea
Sao Paulo, was sold for $43.7 million to a private consortium
of VASP employees and a wealthy businessman.
   The sale took place in an auction at the Sao Paulo Stock
Exchange. The VOE/Canhedo consortium, which was the only
group bidding, purchased 60% of the company's shares. The
privatization of VASP had been in the works for more than two
years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Sao Paulo state government retained 40% of the shares
but is expected to reduce this stake to 30% within three
months. Airline employees will be able to purchase 10% of the
shares owned by the government.
   VOE was recently formed by VASP employees to participate
in the bidding. It owns 20% of the consortium. The
consortium's majority partner, Wagner Canhedo, owns several
transportation, mining, agricultural and tourism companies.
The consortium will have to renegotiate VASP debt of $750
million.
   Mr. Canhedo said he hopes to increase VASP's national and
international flights.
   VASP has a fleet of 21 Boeing Co. 737-200 and eight Boeing
737-300 planes, and three aircraft made by Airbus Industrie,
a European consortium. The airline has routes to most major
Brazilian cities and to Aruba. It also operates charter
flights to Cuba and Argentina.

   MIT Asks Panel
   To Review Choice
   For Magnet Center

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
in an extraordinary attempt to reverse its rejection last
month as the site for a new national magnet research center,
charged that National Science Foundation officials unfairly
undercut its bid for the center.
   MIT officials formally requested the National Science
Board, the NSF's governing body, to reconsider its decision
to award as much as $60 million in federal funding to
establish the magnet center at Florida State University. In
making the request, the MIT officials attacked
recommendations to the board in favor of Florida State from
former NSF director Erich Bloch, who recently stepped down
from his post, and from NSF assistant director David Sanchez.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the NSF officials "had presented a fair and adequate
comparison of the two proposals (from MIT and Florida State),
we would not contest the National Science Board decision,"
MIT President Paul E. Gray wrote in a letter to the board.
"Regrettably, this was not the case."
   Before the NSF board's vote last month, NSF-appointed
"peer review" committees of outside scientists had
recommended MIT as the site for the center. MIT now operates
a national laboratory considered the world leader in research
on strong magnets, which are used for studies on
superconductors, magnetically-levitated trains,
medical-imaging devices and other technologies.
   The NSF reviewers had said they favored MIT largely
because its new magnet center would be fully operational at
least two years sooner than the five or more years it would
take to build the center at Florida State.
   However, the NSF reviewers also had praised Florida
State's proposal, noting that officials there seemed more
enthusiastic about the new center than did administrators at
MIT. In recommending Florida State, Mr. Bloch added that at
proposed federal funding levels for the center, "MIT would
perhaps not be able to, or even committed to, create a
first-rate laboratory." In contrast, he noted, the Florida
State proposal included a commitment of $58 million of funds
from the state of Florida to help build the center.
   In their statements yesterday, MIT officials charged that
NSF staff members had underestimated both their enthusiasm
for the new center and the amount of non-federal funding they
would commit to build it. Among other things, they asserted
that Mr. Bloch "was totally and unfairly silent" in his
recommendation about the number of faculty and staff MIT
would commit to the new center.
   Messrs. Bloch and Sanchez couldn't be reached for comment.
A spokesman for the NSF said its board will "look at and
digest" MIT's request for reconsideration of the magnet
center decision but hasn't yet made a decision regarding it.
   Patrick Riordan, a spokesman for the Florida Board of
Regents, which oversees the state's university system, said,
"We're surprised and disappointed" by MIT's request. "Any
aspersions that might be cast on the caliber of our science
just won't wash."

   A Bit of Brooklyn

   KFAR HABOD, Israel -- Elsewhere in Israel, stores are
selling out of baking soda. Supposedly, a towel soaked in a
solution of bicarbonate of soda and water makes a protective
mask against chemical weapons.
   But in this town, on the sandy Mediterranean plains
skirting Tel Aviv, preparations for a different, more joyful
event are under way. The ultra-orthodox Hasidic Jewish
movement known as the Lubavitchers, several thousand of whom
live here but follow the teachings of an 88-year-old rabbi in
Brooklyn, N.Y., believe that what seems to most like bad news
from the Persian Gulf is actually good news from on high.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As Mendel Fogelman, 32, a plump, pink-cheeked Lubavitcher
visiting Kfar Habod from his home in Worcester, Mass., says,
with his dark eyes twinkling, "We're giving you a scoop. It's
going to be in all the papers, maybe even before you get this
into print. What is going on in Iraq is definitely a sign --
of the imminent arrival of the Messiah."
   Although Mr. Fogelman and the other Lubavitchers here are
brimming over with jokes -- thrusting a plate of cakes in
front of a guest, for instance, and cracking "go ahead, it's
OK, they're kosher" -- on the subject of the Messiah, they
are deadly serious. They have printed bumper stickers
reading, "We want {the} Messiah Now]" They have even built a
house, where the Messiah might want to live.
   The level of excitement and anticipation within the
movement, which is one of Judaism's most dynamic and
fastest-growing sources of ultra-orthodoxy, is almost
palpable. "We've been waiting a long time," says one such
Lubavitcher, Moshe Schlass, 51, a former macrobiotic
food-store owner from Greenwich Village whose five children
now crawl on and off of his lap during dinner at his home in
the ancient Jewish quarter of Jerusalem. "The conflict in the
Gulf is definitely part of the preparation for redemption.
What's going on now is like labor pains. It looks pretty
messy. But in the end what will come out is a new, living
light. The Messiah," he says, his voice growing hushed with
awe, "may be just an eye blink away."
   The Lubavitchers, who claim nearly 1,000 chapters and
millions of followers world-wide, have always awaited the
Messiah. They believe His coming is imminent because that's
what their much-beloved, absolute leader, Rabbi Menachem
Mendel Schneerson, believes. The Brooklyn rabbi, in turn,
cites the Bible as the source of this prophecy.
   Rabbi Schneerson is the seventh in a chain of Lubavitcher
rabbis stretching back to the beginnings of the pietistic
movement that reinvigorated Judaism in the early 18th
century. Unlike other orthodox Hasidic sects, which tend to
keep to themselves, Lubavitchers are actively engaged in the
modern world, reaching out eagerly to persuade less-orthodox
Jews to become more observant and running numerous charities
-- like the one in Kfar Habod, which provides health care to
200 Jewish children from Chernobyl who may have been exposed
to radiation.
   Remarkably, though, their leader has never been to Israel.
In fact, since taking over the leadership 40 years ago, Rabbi
Schneerson has scarcely set foot outside Brooklyn. Yet the
elfin-looking octogenarian with the large dark hat and
lustrous white beard -- who speaks 10 languages and holds an
engineering degree from the Sorbonne -- has tremendous sway
over tens of thousands of Israelis. A word from the rebbe, or
"My Great One," as he is affectionately called, was enough to
tip the electoral balance in two Israeli elections. Last
April, the rebbe snatched victory from the Labor Party after
telling his followers in the government to switch parties.
   Of topical significance to Rabbi Schneerson is a nearly
2,000-year-old passage from Isaiah 60:1, which was written
about in the 13th Century commentary on the Torah, "Yalkut
Shimoni." It makes some eerily familiar-sounding predictions.
For instance, it says that the Messiah will come after a
terrible war, in which the King of Persia, after turning on
the King of Arabia and consulting with the King of Jordan,
"will destroy the whole world." (The Lubavitchers believe
that the ancient name for Persia may correspond not just to
Iran but also to Iraq.) Although it predicts that
"Consternation and confusion will strike all of the nations
of the world," including "the Jewish people," God tells the
Jews to "Have no fear: the time of redemption has arrived."
   Thus, when asked two weeks ago in a letter from one of his
Israeli followers whether it was necessary to take
precautions against a potential Gulf war, such as stocking
extra food, Rabbi Schneerson said absolutely not. A number of
Israeli officials are inclined to agree: The army, which is
in charge of civil defense, has resolutely resisted
entreaties from the public to pass out its store of civilian
gas masks. But such secular assurances don't carry nearly the
weight of the rebbe's, whose word is infallible, at least in
Lubavitcher circles.
   "We've been following him very closely for 40 years, and
he hasn't been wrong yet," says one Lubavitcher scholar, Uri
Kaploun. Lubavitchers say Rabbi Schneerson correctly
predicted both the advent and outcome of the 1967 and 1973
wars. "All kinds of Biblical prophecies come true," says Mr.
Kaploun about the rebbe's current prediction. "And this is
going to happen, too." (The rebbe himself couldn't be reached
for comment; he doesn't talk to the press.)
   So while the rest of Israel frets about war with Saddam
Hussein, the Lubavitchers are ready to welcome a new kind of
peace. "When the Messiah comes," explains Lubavitcher
administrator Yossi Raichik, "sheep will live together with
the wolves, and people will be more spiritual -- there will
be no materialistic rat race, no jealousy, no lust."
   Not just a little lust?
   "Well," admits Mr. Raichik with a smile, "I'm a bit
worried about that too."
   Such qualms not withstanding, the preparations for the
Messiah are pretty impressive. Most eye-catching is an
imposing three-story, red brick edifice, which sticks out
from the barren desert here like an anomalous stage set. This
building is an exact replica of the Lubavtich world
headquarters in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn,
complete with the building's street number "770" Eastern
Parkway over the front door and metal anti-vandalism bars
over the windows, despite the rather low probability of theft
out here in no-man's land.
   Mr. Raichik says the strange building is evidence that
when it comes to believing in the Messiah, "We put our money
where our mouth is." As he explains it, "When the Messiah
comes, the rebbe will come to Israel, as will all the Jewish
people." And "where should the rebbe live, in the King David
Hotel?" asks Mr. Raichik. On the contrary: The rebbe should
live exactly as he does now, working 17 hours each day in a
building he is accustomed to. "So we prepared a building for
him to live in when he comes," says Mr. Raichik. "If you
believe it, you do it."
   Currently, the replica of 770 Eastern Parkway houses a
Talmudic school and the beginnings of an international
library. But on the first floor, behind locked doors, is a
copy of the rebbe's study, which Mr. Raichik has never been
in. "On the third floor we have an apartment," says Mr.
Raichik. "It's not furnished. It was left empty."
   But that's not all. Although Mr. Raichik is reluctant to
discuss the matter at much length, he and the other
Lubavitchers believe that it is possible that the rebbe will
not just come to Israel to live as an ordinary resident.
Actually, he may be the Messiah.
   "I believe that the rebbe is a potential candidate for the
Messiah," says Mr. Raichik carefully. "Every generation has a
candidate. And in this generation, he's definitely the best
one," adds Mr. Fogelman. "There is a chance that the rebbe is
the Messiah," agrees Mr. Schlass, who notes that among other
things, the rebbe has the right hereditary qualifications.
(That and his marriage to the daughter of the sixth
Lubavitcher rabbi qualified him for the leadership.) "The
Messiah has to trace back to David, and the rebbe is traced
to Judah, who is traced to David, on both his mother's and
his father's sides," Mr. Schlass says.
   Such speculation is said to make the Rebbe very
uncomfortable, although his detractors note, he has never
denied his Messianic potential. It certainly makes the more
media-savvy of his followers uncomfortable. A day after
explaining how the house at Kfar Habod had been built for the
rebbe after redemption, Mr. Raichik called repeatedly to
"clarify" the matter. The building, he suggested, in fact has
many purposes. The rebbe himself has directed his followers
to fill the empty third floor. And even given the
significance of the situation in the Gulf, and the likelihood
that redemption is near, nothing is certain enough to get
locked into print.
   "Don't write that the Messiah will live there," says Mr.
Raichik upon consideration. "If I read it myself, I'd say
come on, give me a break."

   Of Black Artists

   MORE BLACK film makers have made deals with major studios
this year than at any other time since the heyday of the
"blacksploitation" films of the 1970s.
   Mike Medavoy, chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, a unit of
Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., told the
convention of journalists in Los Angeles about his production
deal with Warrington and Reginald Hudlin, whose "House Party"
grossed over $25 million this spring. Jeffrey Katzenberg, the
chairman of Walt Disney Studios, reported on his new deal
with critically acclaimed director Charles Lane ("Sidewalk
Stories").
   Actors Denzel Washington and Danny Glover also have new
production deals, along with several black directors and
writers who have been waiting in the wings for years.
   The pacts could lead to a small flood of movies that would
answer black demands for more black films. But Hollywood
deals don't always result in films, warns George Jackson,
co-producer of two successful youth-oriented films, "Krush
Groove" and "Disorderlies." Mr. Jackson, a former executive
with Richard Pryor's film company, noted that not one film
was completed under the comedian's $40 million deal with
Columbia in the late 1980s.
   A torrent of low-budget, low-quality "black" films --
mostly produced by whites -- almost killed the market by the
end of the 1970s, said Doug McHenry, who with Mr. Jackson has
produced the soon-to-be-released "New Jack City." He said the
key to sustaining the new boom is improved production values,
not quantity.
                                                                                                       

   Black Writers Duel
   Over Racial Labels
                                                                                                       

   WHO'S BLACK, and who's not?
   That was the issue hotly debated by a panel at the annual
convention of the National Association of Black Journalists
in Los Angeles recently.
   The session took its title from an Ebony magazine article
that blasted what it saw as a trend among young celebrities
of color to identify themselves as some combination of
ethnicities -- or simply "mixed race" -- instead of black or
African-American. "Whoever is a descendant of Africa is
black," Ebony writer Lynn Norment declared on the panel.
   But Velina Hasu Houston, whose mother is Japanese and
paternal grandparents were African-American and Native
American, says blacks with Ms. Norment's view want to "annex
communities that might have a drop of African blood in them
for their political needs. It's very selfish, and it is
tyranny." Ms. Houston, a playwright, is an activist in a
growing movement advocating a multiracial designation, both
socially and in the national census.
   The push for a new census category was defeated in
Congress last year, but the campaign is likely to gather
steam by the next census. Experts estimate that some 80% of
"blacks" could now check a "mixed-race" box.
   A mixed-race category could complicate emerging efforts to
manage diversity in corporate work forces. "But even if
(categories) changed radically, it wouldn't deny the value of
seizing diversity in the marketplace as a business
advantage," says Ira Jackson, a spokesman for Bank of Boston.
   But black elected officials have strongly opposed the
mixed-race category, because it might dilute black voting
strength and government aid now apportioned under existing
notions of race.
                                                                                                       

   Navahos' Big Role
   In Potato-Chip World
                                                                                                       

   THE NAVAHO nation is keeping this country in the chips.
   The Navaho reservation, the nation's largest, is probably
the biggest supplier of potatoes to the potato-chip industry,
says Albert Keller, who runs Navaho Agricultural Products
Industry.
   The Navahos' high-tech farm covers 55,000 acres around
Farmington, N.M. The 5,000 acres of potatoes yield 230
million pounds of spuds a year, of which 130 million go to
chip makers. The Navahos are the largest potato supplier to
chip-industry leader Frito-Lay Inc., which bought 30 million
pounds last year.
   "They are one of our most quality suppliers," says a Frito
spokeswoman. Frito purchased about 8% of all its supplies
from minority-owned firms last year. "They've been able to
help us when we've had potato shortages," the spokeswoman
says.
   Navaho Agricultural is one of several Navaho enterprises
run like a corporation under a tribe-appointed board. Despite
its successes, Mr. Keller says, the reservation, with a
population of about 215,000, still suffers from high
unemployment and poverty.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends

   THE NUMBER of black CPAs has mushroomed to about 2,500
today from 450 in 1976, according to a study by Bert Mitchell
of Mitchell/Titus &amp; Co., the largest black-owned accounting
firm. But that's still only 0.6% of the nation's CPAs. The
market would supply more black CPAs if industry demanded
more, the study suggests. Only seven of 150 large CPA firms
responding to the survey actively recruit on black college
campuses. And just half of the firms had black professionals
on staff, with 86% of those blacks at just four firms. . . .
Barbie doll maker Mattel Inc. plans this fall to start
promoting the Hispanic, Asian and black versions of the doll
it has quietly sold for years, in hopes of raising minority
market share. But at the same time competitor Matchbox Toys,
a unit of Universal Matchbox Group Ltd., is also taking aim
with a new crew of dolls based on real models, including
Beverly Johnson, one of the first black superstar models.

   The Office of Thrift Supervision regained control of
Franklin Savings Association -- at least for the time being.
   The regulatory agency said a federal appellate court in
Denver issued a temporary order late yesterday blocking the
return of the thrift to management. The order came just a day
after a federal judge in Topeka, Kan., ordered the
institution returned, ruling that the agency had been
"arbitrary and capricious" in placing Franklin under the
conservatorship of the Resolution Trust Corp. in February.
The ruling cut short a celebration among employees and
managers of the Ottawa, Kan., thrift over the return of
company founder and chairman Ernest M. Fleischer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An OTS spokesman said he didn't know how long the
temporary stay would remain in effect, but that the RTC would
resume its conservatorship of Franklin immediately, pending a
ruling on its formal appeal, also filed yesterday.
   Roger Stanton, an attorney for Franklin Savings, called
the order a procedural matter, granted to give the three
judges on the appellate court panel, who live in different
states, time to read the trial court's ruling. "It has
nothing to do with any substantive point," he said, adding
that if the appeals panel doesn't rule on the validity of the
judge's order within a week or two he will file a motion
asking the panel to speed its deliberations.
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Dale E. Saffels ordered
the agency to return the reins of the institution to Mr.
Fleischer, a decision that raised questions about federal
regulators' interpretation of the powers granted them under
last year's massive thrift reform package. If the decision
ultimately stands, it could embolden other thrifts to
challenge forced write-downs or regulatory takeovers.
   The OTS originally placed Franklin in conservatorship
after the enactment of rigid new accounting standards for
thrifts. Under the new rules, the agency decided that
Franklin could no longer defer losses of $119 million on
futures contracts purchased to hedge against possible losses
in its unusual investment portfolio, which consisted
primarily of mortgage-backed securities. By forcing an
immediate write-down of those losses and others, Franklin's
capital fell below regulatory standards.
   The hedging strategy was the underpinning of Mr.
Fleischer's much-ballyhooed plan to build a far-reaching
financial institution. He eschewed traditional mortgage
lending and short-term savings deposits to avoid the
interest-rate squeeze that trapped many thrifts. Of the
thrift's $11.4 billion in assets, more than 90% was invested
in mortgage-backed securities. To regulators, that strategy
was a high-risk bet on volatile investment instruments.
   The OTS spokesman said the agency was confident it had
acted properly. In anticipation of the appellate court's
order, he said, the agency had taken a number of steps
earlier in the day to "control the situation down there." In
a letter from OTS director Timothy Ryan to Mr. Fleischer,
delivered yesterday, Franklin Savings management was ordered
to abide by current capital standards and to obtain prior
approval from OTS for any increase in salaries or payment of
bonuses to any officer or director. The letter also ordered
the thrift to get prior approval before purchasing any
high-risk mortgage-derivative product or reversing any
accounting entries made by the conservator.
   The court's action won't sit well with Franklin employees,
who were glad to see the RTC go, even if it was only
temporary. Employees at the thrift's operations center in
Lenexa, Kan., already had posted a handmade sign that made
their feelings clear: The acronym RTC was circled and marked
out with a slash; around that, someone had written, "don't go
away mad, just go away."
   For a time yesterday, it seemed that Judge Saffels's order
to return the thrift to management would hold up. Judge
Saffels refused to delay the order, which left lawyers for
the OTS scrambling to get a ruling from the Denver court. The
appellate court has been slow to act on such requests in the
past. OTS director Timothy Ryan removed Franklin from
conservatorship before the judge's 10 a.m. deadline and RTC
employees vacated the thrift's headquarters and eight
branches.
   The news even reached the stock market, which reacted
positively. Franklin Savings's long-depressed stock rose in
over-the-counter "pink sheet" trading. That refers to the
colored paper on which prices are listed for non-Nasdaq,
over-the-counter stocks. Franklin's stock had been delisted
in April for having fallen below the NASD's minimum capital
and surplus requirements. By the time the appellate court
returned control to the RTC, the markets were closed.
   Meanwhile, Franklin Savings officials, some of whom seemed
stunned to be back in their offices after six and a half
months in exile, barely began the laborious task of assessing
what impact RTC supervision had on the institution's
financial condition. The institution's $4 billion in
deposits, which it had when the conservatorship was imposed
in February, had fallen by about $400 million to $500
million. "What I want to do is look at the securities
portfolio and see what's there, what's been sold and what our
hedges are," said Franklin Savings' president John Scowcroft.
   He didn't get much of a chance before being evicted again,
and probably won't, at least until the appeals court rules on
the dispute.
   For a few hours, though, Mr. Fleischer was a king again.
He embarked on a triumphant tour of Franklin operations,
where he was greeted by cheers and applause. "It's just great
to have Ernie back," said Rene Chamberlain, a manager at the
operations center in Lenexa.
   Later, at the Olathe, Kan., branch, Mr. Fleischer accepted
several rounds of congratulations, then led the applause for
an unsuspecting young man who wandered in to open an account.
Kevin Spears, the Olathe branch manager, presented the
chairman with a token of appreciation, a baseball cap bearing
the slogan: "I think, therefore I am the boss."

   "Financial Loss: Big Banks Are Plagued by a Gradual

sad story about the dismal profit prospects in the banking

granted, and one issue that can serve to alter future
performance.
   The fact is that we simply have too many banks with
enormous redundancies. With more than 13,000 banks performing
functions that could be accomplished by fewer than 100 across
the country, expense rationalization is a necessity for
having this industry earn reasonable rates of return. The
regulatory process simply must permit combinations that serve

   GM's Olds Division to Offer Warranty
   On Used Cars to Lift Showroom Traffic
   ----

   PONTIAC, Mich. -- General Motors Corp.'s struggling
Oldsmobile division is extending the new-car warranty wars to
the used-car arena in an effort to woo customers back into
dealer showrooms.
   Oldsmobile said that beginning late this year or early
next year, customers who buy selected 1984-1991 model used
cars from Olds dealers automatically will get free repairs
for 30 days, a limited one-year warranty on engine,
transmission and other major systems, and one year of free
towing or roadside service.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Customers won't be charged for the warranty plans, Olds
officials said. Currently, used-car buyers who want such
warranty coverage must pay extra for it. Under the Olds
program, dealers will pay a fee to GM for the coverage; Olds
officials said they expect that fee will be recovered in the
prices dealers charge for the cars.
   The move is one of the broadest efforts by a major
manufacturer to extend newcar warranty protection features to
secondhand vehicles, and is a first for a GM division. The
offer highlights the growing importance of used-car sales
industrywide as new car sales continue to skid.
   A growing number of car dealers are weathering the hard
times by snapping up cars that have seen less than a year of
use in rental car fleets, and marketing them as "nearly new"
cars priced thousands of dollars less than similar "all-new"
models. (Many of the big rental-car companies also sell these
slightly used cars and offer extended warranty coverage.)
These cars increasingly are a customer's first experience
with a particular brand.
   GM alone expects to take back and resell through dealers
some 500,000 "nearly new" GM cars this year, a company
official said. That's equivalent to about 14% of GM's annual
U.S. car sales volume.
   Factory-sponsored warranties for used cars are rare in the
auto industry, but not unheard of. The U.S. sales arm of
Mercedes-Benz is offering a warranty on certain used Mercedes
cars that covers the engine, transmission and other major
systems. Mileage is unlimited, there is no deductible charge
for covered repairs, and Mercedes throws in free towing and
roadside service. The German luxury car maker first offered a
used car warranty two years ago to help dealers weather a
sales slump caused by the sharp, exchange-rate-driven
escalation of Mercedes prices.
   Olds also has good reason to take extraordinary steps to
help its dealers sell more cars, new or used. The division
expects its 3,100 dealers will sell about 500,000 new cars
for the 1990 model year that ends Sept. 30. That's barely
half the number of new Oldsmobiles sold in 1986. The dramatic
sales and market share plunge has left some 30% of Oldsmobile
dealers unprofitable this year, division officials said.
   Offering a factory warranty for secondhand cars may not
help sell new Oldsmobiles. But it "helps dealers, which helps
us sell more {new} Oldsmobiles long-term," Oldsmobile
Division General Manager J. Michael Losh said during a 1991
model briefing at GM's Orion assembly plant.
   The Oldsmobile plan is even broader than the Mercedes
offer. Under the Olds program, called Value-Rated Edge, a
customer who buys a 1984-1991 model used car -- whether made
by GM or not -- from an Oldsmobile dealer may return the car
for free repairs within 30 days, or 1,000 miles. After that,
Olds will pay for repairs to the engine, transmission and
other major parts for 12 months or 12,000 miles. A $100
deductible will be charged for each repair visit. Olds will
kick in 12 months of free towing or roadside repair service.
   Customers who buy slightly used 1990 or 1991 Oldsmobiles
will get the remainder of GM's standard 36-month, 50,000 mile
warranty coverage. But they won't have to pay the usual $100
per visit deductible under a program Olds is calling
Value-Rated Plus.
   There are several conditions to the Olds offer. Dealers
will select which used cars come with the warranty extension.
The car can't have more than 50,000 miles on it. And cars
used for commercial purposes such as taxis aren't covered.
   Oldsmobile portrayed the used-car warranty offer as an
extension of its year-old new-car warranty plan, called the
Oldsmobile Edge. That program allows buyers to return a new
Oldsmobile within 30 days or 1,500 miles and get full credit
toward the purchase of another Oldsmobile. The program was
unique in the industry at the time. However, last month,
Volkswagen AG's U.S. sales arm one-upped Oldsmobile by
offering unhappy buyers of its Passat model their money back
within 30 days or 3,000 miles.

   I was distressed to read your July 9 article "Genetic
Testing May Mark Some People as Undesirable to Employers,
Insurers."
   Job discrimination against people with polycystic kidney
disease is so unnecessary. It is wrong to deny a person a job
because of a genetic test for a disease that may never cause
symptoms. The individual is denied the important role of
participating in the work force and the work force is denied
the advantage of a multitalented large group of employees.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The article mentions that this discrimination may result
before the course of the disease is determined, inasmuch as
debilitating symptoms might not even occur until a person
reaches late middle age. This is an important fact because
only 50% of people with polycystic kidney disease reach the
stage of renal failure. The advanced technologies of dialysis
and transplantation may even give those with kidney failure
the benefit of participating in the work force until
retirement.
   Since 1982, the Polycystic Kidney Research Foundation has
promoted research into the cause, cure and treatment of
polycystic kidney disease. Currently, more than a dozen major
medical centers in this country and abroad are involved in
research projects related to this disease. It is my sincere
hope that this common genetic illness will be conquered
within the decade of the '90s.

   Gold Prices Advance as Diplomacy's Failure
   To Resolve Persian Gulf Crisis Raises Tensions

   NEW YORK -- Gold futures prices firmed as traders,
watching diplomatic moves fail to settle the Persian Gulf
crisis, concluded that chances of a military confrontation
are rising.
   The most active gold contract, for December, ended near
its high for the day with a gain of $3.20 an ounce at
$396.20. December silver was pulled up by gold and rose 3.3
cents an ounce to $4.87. October platinum was off $2 an ounce
at $482.20.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Two weeks ago, the world was braced for a military clash
in the Middle East; but when it didn't take place, hope grew
that there would be a diplomatic settlement," said William
O'Neill, senior futures strategist for Merrill Lynch. "Now
that hope, too, is fading away, and traders are becoming
nervous once more."
   A major reason that gold isn't reacting more strongly to
the Mideast crisis, Mr. O'Neill said, is that there is little
investor demand for bullion.
   "There was very little Far Eastern buying interest for
gold bullion early in the year, but there was a pickup from
Taiwan in August," he said. "Japan wasn't much of a buyer,
even in August, and European demand has been even more
lackluster. Without purchases of bullion in the cash market,
prices have little chance of advancing significantly and,
even if they do, of holding onto their gains."
   The continued strength in crude oil was a price-firming
factor in gold, said Greg Klochkoff, vice president of Bank
of Boston in Providence, R.I.
   "Traders are also watching the headlines about the Middle
East and the White House reaction to the whole situation," he
said. Mr. Klochkoff said traders who previously sold gold
contracts short in anticipation of falling prices might
decide to cover, or buy back their positions, today so as not
get caught off base by any weekend developments in the Middle
East.
   "If anything happens, it would most likely be something
that would make prices go up," he said. "The short-covering
could firm prices, but by late in the day {today} that demand
should fade, and prices could fall back somewhat."
   Jeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious Metals
Advisors Inc. in Toronto, said in his latest review of the
precious metals market, released yesterday, that consumer
confidence in the U.S. is dropping. He said a recession in
the U.S. and a slowdown in the world economy could severely
affect buying of gold jewelry -- which is one of the most
discretionary and most postponable of all consumer purchases
but is the backbone of the gold market.
   The world jewelry industry last year consumed an estimated
58.2 million ounces of gold, Mr. Nichols said, far exceeding
supplies from Western world mine production of about five
million ounces. The jewelry demand also absorbed more than
70% of all supplies entering the market from scrap and from
sales by Communist nations as well as from forward sales and
gold borrowings by mining companies, he said.
   "Since the lion's share of jewelry sales occur during the
fourth-quarter holiday shopping spree, the state of the
consumer during the next few months will have a
disproportionately large bearing on how the year shapes up
for jewelry manufacturers," Mr. Nichols said.
   As for the price of gold itself, it has "performed so
poorly for so long that Western investors will need to see
evidence of a sustainable bull market before returning with
confidence," he said.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices gained ground for a second
consecutive day on rumors that the Soviet Union will be
granted emergency export credits after the Bush-Gorbachev
summit meeting this weekend. The Bush administration so far
hasn't given any indication whether such credits are in the
cards. The latest six-to-10-day forecast from the National
Weather Service, which calls for hot, dry weather across most
Midwestern and Southern growing regions, also is likely to
lend support to futures prices, analysts said. Soybean
futures for November delivery advanced 5.25 cents a bushel to
close at $6.3175. December corn futures gained 1.75 cents a
bushel to close at $2.3775, and December wheat futures rose
1.75 cents a bushel to close at $2.825.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices rose. The October contract advanced
0.47 cent a pound to 11.24 cents. A price-firming factor was
an announcement by Brazil late Wednesday that it would export
only 550,000 tons of raw sugar this season, according to
Judith Ganes, analyst for Merrill Lynch. That amount is down
from expectations in the sugar business that Brazilian
exports would be around 650,000 tons, and from its exports
last year of more than 700,000 tons, Ms. Ganes said. Brazil's
sugar season runs from June to May. Brazil appears to be
holding back some cane supplies as a precaution so it can use
them to make alcohol fuel for automobiles to help combat the
crude oil price surge triggered by the Mideast crisis, Ms.
Ganes said. Also, there is concern about immediately
available supplies of raw sugar in the world market, she
said. The present time represents a lull in the market before
the receipt of supplies from major growers such as Europe,
where the harvest is in progress, and Thailand, where
harvesting will reach its peak in December, according to Ms.
Ganes. Another possible price-firming factor was speculation
that the U.S. import quota may be raised next week, she said.
Currently the quota for the 21 months ending Sept. 30 is 3.2
million tons.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices again advanced. The December
contract was up 1.20 cents a pound to $1.2340. Buying was
mostly technical, according to one analyst, who said the New
York market was also reflecting gains in London that were
prompted by production problems in Zambia, a major copper
supplier to Europe. The miners' strike in Peru, which was in
its 21st day, was also a price-firming factor, the analyst
said.

   Goodyear Sees
   3rd-Period Loss
   Of $65 Million
   ----

</IN>
<LP>
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., its margins squeezed by weak
tire prices and rising raw-material costs, said it expects to
post a third-quarter net loss of about $65 million after $51
million in charges.
   The expected third-quarter loss would be the largest
quarterly deficit in Goodyear's history, a company spokesman
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the 1989 third quarter, the Akron, Ohio, tire maker
reported net income of $70.5 million, or $1.22 a share, on
sales of $2.68 billion.
   Goodyear, which also forecast that fourth-quarter earnings
will be flat, signaled that its situation might worsen. The
company said a general economic downturn is likely later this
year, continuing into 1991, with the Mideast crisis possibly
resulting in increased raw-material costs and other adverse
market conditions. Tire makers rely heavily on
petroleum-related products: A single tire requires as much as
eight gallons of crude oil or equivalents.
   Goodyear's predicament reflects a general decline
throughout the world tire business. For instance, Continental
AG of West Germany recently forecast that most tire makers
will have a "considerable drop" in 1990 earnings. Continental
noted that tire prices have dropped so precipitously in the
last 12 months that "the market situation has turned into a
regular price war."
   Continental, the No. 4 tire maker world-wide and parent of
General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. in Akron, said it wasn't certain
how long it will take for the current earnings slump to
bottom out.
   While Japanese tire makers don't appear to be suffering as
much as their counterparts in other nations, Bridgestone
Corp. of Japan is saddled with debt from its purchase of
Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. of Akron. Bridgestone also has
been raising a fuss over the amount of capital investment
that has been required to bring its Firestone plants into
shape.
   But unlike Goodyear, Continental and Bridgestone expect to
finish the year in the black. Analysts said Goodyear's
performance was far worse than expected. "It's a staggering
kind of loss, even excluding unusual items," said Donald F.
DeScenza, an independent analyst based in Springdale, Conn.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Goodyear stock fell 87.5 cents a share to close at $22.25 a
share.
   The bulk of the charges that Goodyear took in the third
quarter are related to the planned layoffs by mid-1992 of
1,180 employees involved in European tire marketing and
distribution. Earlier this year, the company laid off 1,100
tire sales and marketing employees in the U.S.
   Goodyear said the restructuring also includes phasing out,
at its Valleyfield, Quebec, plant, tire production for
mediumsized and heavy trucks. The company said there would be
further layoffs of employees overseas, but it wasn't more
specific. Earlier this year the company laid off 530
employees at Valleyfield and 270 employees at the company's
Union City, Tenn., tire plant.
   The company also said some of the charges were for
environmental cleanup costs associated with operations that
were discontinued in 1986.
   Hoping to ease the strain on its profit margins, Goodyear
plans a 2% to 6% increase in prices for replacement tires,
effective Oct. 1. That comes on the heels of a similar
increase last month. Other tire makers also have announced
price rises, but so far it's unclear whether the increases
will come into effect.
   "If the prices don't firm, you're looking at a loss for
the fourth quarter" at Goodyear, said Harry W. Millis, an
analyst at McDonald &amp; Co., Cleveland. He had earlier expected
Goodyear to earn about 25 cents a share in the third quarter,
excluding unusual items.
   Goodyear is the only one of the major U.S. tire companies
that wasn't acquired during massive industry consolidation in
recent years. In 1986 it thwarted a takeover attempt by Sir
James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier. Even now, with
its depressed stock price, it doesn't appear to be a likely
takeover candidate because it operates a money-losing crude
oil pipeline that it can't sell. Goodyear stock currently is
trading at less than half of its 1990 peak of $46 a share in
January.

   Ramsay Health Care
   To Report Decline

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, MEDICINE, DENTISTRY (HEA)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW ORLEANS -- Ramsay Health Care Inc. expects to report
net income of two cents or three cents a share for its fiscal
fourth quarter after a 12-cent-a-share refinancing charge.
   The company, an operator of psychiatric hospitals, is
already seeing some "real savings in interest" because of the
debt restructuring completed during its fourth quarter ended
June 30, Bradley J. Velie, Ramsay's chief financial officer,
said in an interview.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition to the refinancing charge, the fourth-quarter
earnings of $300,000 to $400,000 also includes an operating
loss carry-forward roughly equal to the net income. Revenue
for the quarter rose to about $40 million. In the
year-earlier quarter, Ramsay earned $1.6 million, or 11 cents
a share, on revenue of $38.8 million.
   For the year, Ramsay expects to report net income of
between $4.9 million and $5.1 million, or about 33 cents to
34 cents a share, on revenue of about $153 million. In fiscal
1989, the company earned $3.7 million, or 26 cents a share,
on revenue of $147.7 million.
   Under the refinancing, Ramsay converted most of its
floating debt to fixed and capped the rest. Mr. Velie said
the new debt package also allows the company to defer certain
principal payments for up to three years and carries much
less restrictive covenants.
   Mr. Velie said Ramsay's pretax profit is a better
indication of the company's financial recovery. For fiscal
1990, pretax profit nearly doubled to $10 million from $5.1
million for the year before, he said. "Cost control measures
have put us in a very good strategic place for future years,"
he said, adding that he expects pretax income to increase by
15% to 20% for the current year.
   Ralph Watts, Ramsay's president and chief executive
officer, said in the interview that the industry is going
through a period of consolidation as large chains cut back
and some not-for-profit hospitals fail.
   "There will be a lot of things for sale in the next couple
of years," he said. "We believe there will be some bargains
out there." Continuing its debt reduction efforts is a top
priority for Ramsay, Mr. Watts said, but the right
acquisition opportunity wouldn't be ignored.
   The company currently has 16 facilities and a total of
1,433 beds. The occupancy rate for its hospitals has
decreased in the past year to about 54.6% from 57.3%, Mr.
Watts said, primarily because of shorter stays by patients
and increased competition in some markets.
   The company is also pursuing opportunities in Canada and
in Europe and expects soon to announce its first project
outside the U.S., Mr. Watts said.

   WASHINGTON -- Fitchburg Gas &amp; Electric Light Co. said its
board authorized the company's management to explore several
alternatives to a proposed buy-out by Eastern Utilities
Associates, including a merger or business combination with a
third party.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the Fitchburg, Mass.-based company said it may engage in
discussions with third parties. These discussions could lead
to negotiations with respect to a merger, leveraged buy-out,
recapitalization, restructuring, the sale of debt or equity,
or a major acquisition, the company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The board's decision came at a Sept. 5 meeting, after
Fitchburg's independent committee reaffirmed its earlier
decision to reject Eastern Utilities's offer. Eastern
Utilities earlier offered $36 a share for Fitchburg, and $40
a share for Unitil Corp., which agreed to merge with
Fitchburg last year.
   The committee concluded that greater value would be
realized by remaining independent or pursuing a merger, the
company said.
   A spokesman for Fitchburg said the latest filing will
allow the company more "flexibility" and "options" not
previously available. Fitchburg Gas &amp; Electric Light said it
has had Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as its financial
advisor since announcing its merger agreement with Unitil
Corp. last year.

   I was fascinated to read Reps. Howard Wolpe (D., Mich.)
and Frank Horton (R., N.Y.) bemoaning the "transfer of
wealth" from the Northeast and Midwest to the Southwest,
which they perceive taking place as a result of the federal
bailout of the S&amp;L mess ("The S&amp;L Bailout: Looting the North
for Texas' Benefit," editorial page, Aug. 14). Apparently
they believe in the integrity of the union only in those
cases when their respective constituencies stand on the plus
side of the federal ledger.
   If Messrs. Wolpe and Horton are truly concerned with
balancing these types of regional transfers, perhaps their
analysis should begin with their regions repaying the
Southwest the tens (if not hundreds) of billions of dollars
that flowed to the Northeast and Midwest by virtue of federal
price controls on oil (1973-80) and natural gas
(1954-present). These misguided regulations not only
encourage a massive waste of valuable and nonrenewable
natural resources and subsidized imported oil, but also
represent a "transfer of wealth" as real as any government
insurance or transfer-payment program.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is highly unlikely that Congress had any regional bias
in mind when it handed the keys to the federal treasury to
the hustlers and con men by so liberalizing our banking laws.
Therefore, its members should not now be heard to complain
that their respective states didn't attract their share of
crooks.
   At least in that one regard federal price controls differ
from the S&amp;L bailout: Price controls were designed to loot
one region of the country for the benefit of the others.

   Texas may indeed be the barn door through which the
majority of S&amp;L dollars have flown, but the door was unlocked
and opened wide by ill-conceived legislation sponsored and
passed by Messrs. Wolpe and Horton's fellow wise men in
Washington.

   The authors assume a loss -- looting and benefit that may
be misplaced -- while overlooking another under their noses.
   Taxpayers are, to be sure, paying for losses at today's
depressed price levels, and are asked to finance those losses
over 30 to 40 years. But the true wealth transfer may well
belong to asset buyers who benefit from cyclical recoveries
in asset values. This is attributable to Texas only if the
buyers are from Texas.
   The Commerce Department report on Texas's resurgence
during the 1990s, to which the authors refer, suggests that
the "glut" of property dampening real-estate values today is
setting the stage for a large wealth transfer to buyers to be
realized tomorrow. But it is in the nature of Washington
politics to be mesmerized by yesterday's problems.

   I think the situation will be healthy for Northeastern
states in the long run. The Northeast is so socialistic,
backward and crime-infested that like Russia it will have to
go completely broke before returning to normal capitalism and
some semblance of social order. (Been to New York City
lately?) So perhaps Texas is doing the Northeast a favor by
drawing money away and helping to speed up that "going broke"
process that will lead to true Northeastern economic and
social reform. Bitter medicine but necessary. Bravo for
Texas.

   If Karen Elliott House is correct in describing Jordan's
King Hussein as "a little organ grinder leading around a
giant gorilla on a leash" (editorial page, Aug. 14), then how
are we to describe the world leaders who played footsie with
Saddam Hussein during and after the Iran-Iraq war?
   I'm amazed that Ms. House failed to mention the $50
billion (and perhaps considerably more) in weapons and
electronics equipment shipped to Iraq by the U.S., West
Germany, France, the Soviet Union and Japan. If Americans get
killed in Saudi Arabia, it won't be with camels made in
Jordan, but with sophisticated military hardware. We were
absolute fools to believe that we could safely build up
Saddam Hussein as a counterweight to Iran without taking
major risks ourselves. We've done the same before with the
likes of Manuel Noriega, and sooner or later the piper must
be paid.

begging for favors from the monster it created.

   In response to James B. Rule's demand for privacy from
"junk mail" (editorial page, Aug. 15) he can contact the
Direct Marketing Association's Mail Preference Service to
have his name removed from mailing lists. Considering the
costs of postage, mailing lists and printing, most marketers
will gladly refrain from sending materials to those who will
not buy things by mail.
   As for Mr. Rule's demands of 20 cents for each time his
name is sold, I suggest that he also ask for payment each
time he is assaulted by television or radio advertising, or
that he receive a rebate from the publisher of his newspaper
or favorite magazine. Just as we can choose to ignore print
or media advertising, so, too, can we simply throw away
direct mail advertising. No one is forcing Mr. Rule to open
his mail.

   Japanese Sailor's Fall From Grace in America

   With a handful of novels, T. Coraghessan Boyle has
established himself as one of the most inventive writers
around. Pared-down tales of ordinary life are not for him:
Mr. Boyle's novels careen through history and time, hop from
continent to continent and make frequent pit stops for sex,
substance abuse and the supernatural.
   Big subjects suit this more-is-better approach, and Mr.
Boyle is at his best when he takes a page from history and
lets his imagination run wild scribbling over it. The real
17th-century explorer Mungo Park was the inspiration for his
1981 novel "Water Music." A roller-coaster ride of a book,
"Water Music" entwined Mungo's search for the source of the
Niger with the fortunes of Ned Rise, a London rogue.

<TEXT>
   North America's colonial past was the point of departure
for his 1987 "World's End," arguably his best novel to date.
Walter Van Brunt, a native of a sleepy Hudson Valley town
called Peterskill, finds himself literally haunted by the
ghosts of his family history. Weaving between Walter's
present in the 1960s and his Dutch immigrant ancestors'
17th-century past, this richly imagined tale of treachery and
blood ties worked a kind of magic realism on suburban New
York -- something this former Larchmont resident would have
thought impossible.
   High expectations may be partly responsible for my
disappointment with "East Is East" (Viking, 364 pages,
$19.95), Mr. Boyle's latest novel. This tale of a half-breed
Japanese sailor who goes AWOL in a Georgia swamp lacks much
of the manic energy that propels the best of Mr. Boyle's
fiction.
   The orphaned son of an American hippie father and a rock
'n' roll-crazed Japanese mother, Hiro Tanaka is tormented as
"a half-breed, a `happa', a high-nose and butterstinker." He
soothes his loneliness with food and the works of self-styled
samurai/writer Yukio Mishima. Hiro dreams of losing himself
in the multiracial crowds of America, and signs on as third
cook on a States-bound ship. After a flare-up with his
shipmates lands him in the brig, he jumps ship with $8 and a
copy of his precious Mishima taped to his chest.
   Hiro washes up on swampy Tupelo Island, home to assorted
rednecks, genteel old-timers and Thanatopsis House, an
artists' colony run by the aged Septima Lights.
   Mr. Boyle lampoons this plushly appointed retreat with
gusto. At Thanatopsis, a servitor wakes colonists with a
different Romance-language greeting each morning, colonists
breakfast at "silent" or "convivial" tables, and the writing
bungalows are fittingly named for literary suicides. The
colonists include a lecherous middle-aged writer, a musician
who composes works for piano and alarm clock, and Ruth
Dershowitz, a talentless writer-wannabe whose main
qualification for residency is her romance with Septima's
son, Saxby.
   When Ruth discovers Hiro stealing her daily lunch pail
from the porch of her writing bungalow, she latches onto him
as "a living story, a fiction come to life." Ruth gives her
new-found pet food and shelter, hides him from a pair of
bumbling immigration officers and briefly beds him.
   In an unwitting return for these favors, Hiro is
incorporated into her soppy work-in-progress about a
Japanese-American housewife. When he finally grows restless
for escape, Ruth tries to placate him with cans of fried fish
and bamboo shoots.
   The idea of a writer imprisoning her subject in a
velvet-padded cage is a provocative one, but it is only
sketchily developed here. Hiro is soon on the run again,
dashing from Ruth's bungalow to a fresh series of
misadventures that land him first in an antebellum jail cell,
and finally in the alligator-infested heart of the Okefenokee
Swamp.
   These Keystone Kop-style escapades are full of sound and
motion, but with a sour edge. Just about everywhere he goes,
Hiro meets the same reception: "He saw the hate in their cold
rinsed-out "hakujin" eyes . . . he was an insect, a snake,
something to be stepped on and ground into the dirt,
eliminated." Almost universally despised, hunted down like an
escaped murderer, used and ultimately betrayed by the woman
who sheltered him, Hiro is a punching bag of a character.
"The City of Brotherly Love was an illusion," he muses toward
the end. "In defeat, there was only one path to honor, and
that was death."
   Mr. Boyle may be reaching for black humor with Hiro's
doomed search for the picture-perfect America of his dreams.
If so, he misses the mark. Unrelieved by any governing sense
of irony, Hiro's plight is just plain sad.
   If "East Is East" isn't great Boyle, it's still very
entertaining, thanks to the quirky and engaging characters
that pop up at its margins. A Ramboesque Vietnam vet tries to
lure Hiro from the swamps with disco music and traps baited
with designer T-shirts and jeans; and in one of the funniest
scenes, a dazed old woman invites him into her home because
she thinks he is Seiji Ozawa.
   But the lunatic energy that has made this writer so much
fun to read is mostly missing. "East Is East" is a curiously
small book, as circumscribed as the island on which it is
set. Mr. Boyle should stick to the mainland -- when he's at
his best, his imagination eats up miles faster than a 747.

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices tumbled because of soaring oil
prices and the growing expectation among investors that
analysts are about to unleash a torrent of reduced
corporate-earnings estimates.
   The October futures contract for crude oil advanced $1.66
a barrel to close at $31.43. There were news reports of
violence against Americans in Kuwait, which could spark a
military confrontation. Oil's climb helped drive the Dow
Jones Industrial Average down 31.93 points in light trading
to 2596.29.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bonds rose slightly, with traders reluctant to change
positions ahead of today's report on how the nation's work
force fared last month. The consensus expectation is that the
unemployment rate will be unchanged from July's 5.5%.
   The dollar continued to slump against most other major
currencies. The yen continued to rise on speculation that
Japanese interest rates are likely to increase while those in
the U.S. decline.
   Although rising oil prices didn't help, it was reports of
analysts readying earnings-estimate cuts that sent shivers
through the stock market. For example, Smith Barney
downgraded its estimate for Motorola, and the stock plunged 7
5/8 to 61 1/2.
   A couple of technical indicators also may have triggered
some selling. The rise Wednesday in the Dow industrials to
2628.22 pushed the average close to a range in which
technicians expect resistance from buyers. That reading was
confirmed Wednesday for some analysts by a 10-day average of
a ratio of volume in advancing stocks to volume in declining
ones.
   "That said the market was no longer oversold, so that
changed the mind-set of the bargain hunters," said Ted
Eggert, manager of equity research at Yamaichi International.
"With the background of earnings-estimate cuts, this {market}
is not a fun place to be."
   Christopher Pedersen, trading director at Twenty-First
Securities, said the softness in the dollar also is
depressing stock prices. "Normally the dollar would rally in
a situation like this," he said, referring to the threat of
war in the Mideast. "The fact that that's not happening has
been a big surprise for a lot of people."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell. Volume was 125.6 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues led
advancers, 960 to 511.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose 1/8 of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000
of face amount, in light trading. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond eased to 8.95%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5550 marks and 140.70 yen, compared with
1.5585 marks and 141.70 yen Wednesday.

   Allen Neuharth, the combative former chairman of Gannett
Co., denied yesterday's report in the Washington Post that
the Gannett Foundation purchased copies of his book,
"Confessions of an S.O.B.," in a campaign to move it up the
best-seller list.
   Gannett Foundation President and Chief Executive Charles
Overby yesterday acknowledged that the foundation bought
2,000 copies of the book, but said the purchase "was
consistent with our mission of teaching young journalists and
other young people how to succeed in life."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ben Bradlee, executive editor of the Post, said, "The
story speaks for itself wonderfully. The reporter did a lot
of work."
   In the same statement with Mr. Overby, Mr. Neuharth,
chairman of the Gannett Foundation since retiring from the
company 17 months ago, took a swipe at the Post and Mr.
Bradlee. He said the story proved the Post was "the most
overrated newspaper in the U.S.A." and he was proud to be "so
prominent on Bradlee's and the Post's enemy list." Mr.
Neuharth was the founder of USA Today.
   In its story, the Post said the foundation, which is based
in Arlington, Va., used $40,000 of its funds to buy about
2,000 copies of the Neuharth book upon its publication last
fall. The Post story said Gannett Co. editors were asked to
purchase several copies of the book at retail price in their
local communities around the country. They were asked to send
the books to the foundation, which donated them to college
libraries and journalism schools and then reimbursed editors
for the books.
   Zach Binkley, executive editor of the Huntington (W.Va.)
Herald-Dispatch, confirmed in an interview that Mr. Overby
asked him to buy "a few" copies of Mr. Neuharth's book. "When
Overby called, I didn't say yes or no," Mr. Binkley said.
"Only later, when I thought about it, I decided I wouldn't
and wrote him a note. I never got the idea he was doing this
for the foundation. I thought it was just on the personal
level."
   Mr. Neuharth will get another shot at a best-seller list.
On Oct. 25, New American Library will publish "S.O.B." in
paperback in a printing of more than 100,000. In hardcover,
for Doubleday Inc., Mr. Neuharth's book made the fall
nonfiction bestsellers list, selling 160,000 copies between
September 1989 and the end of 1989.
   In Washington, the Internal Revenue Service declined to
comment on the Neuharth-book situation. But a spokesman said
that if a charitable organization is found to have benefited
an individual, it could be in violation of the tax laws.

   Academic Festival for Brahms

   Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. -- Say Brahms and most people
will conjure up a stuffy, grumpy, bearded old musical
conservative, a composer of dense and darkly pensive music.
But it is, nonetheless, with Brahms that Bard College has
launched an ambitious and lively new summer music festival
here beside the glowing mystical beauty of the Hudson River
Valley.
   Held during the last two weekends of August, and taking
place in the handsome, inviting 350-seat Olin Auditorium or
an uninviting 600-seat vinyl tent -- where late August heat,
stifling humidity and armies of bugs tested the most devoted
Brahmsian -- the festival invited audiences to "rediscover"
works as overly familiar as Brahms's First Piano Concerto and
Fourth Symphony and the First Piano Trio. That it succeeded
as well as it did was an accomplishment surprising, it
seemed, only to those not acquainted with Leon Botstein.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Rediscovering Brahms" was, in many ways, the Leon
Botstein show. Mr. Botstein is president of Bard College, a
professor of history and music, principal conductor of the
Hudson Valley Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra, author of a
forever forthcoming book on "fin de siecle" Vienna and a
sometime music critic. As the festival's music director, Mr.
Botstein served as conductor, musical sleuth (uncovering a
number of works by forgotten contemporaries of Brahms as well
as oddball editions of well-known Brahms scores), astute
essayist (in a companion book to the festival, "Brahms and
His World," published by Princeton), program annotator,
virtuoso pre-concert speaker (where he could spew P.T. Barnum
baloney and offer genuine musical insight in the same
ardently delivered sentence) and page turner.
   Unlike most summer festivals devoted to a single composer,
such as the popular Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center,
Bard's was not content to simply put on stellar performances
of the featured composer and a few of his contemporaries. Mr.
Botstein's intention was, instead, to present Brahms in the
light of the composer's Vienna so that we might hear Brahms
differently.
   So familiar Brahms scores were heard in unfamiliar
versions; works by forgotten Brahms contemporaries were
dusted off, some not having been performed this century;
noted Brahms authorities introduced concerts; and a "Great
Piano Debate" was held that was no debate at all but rather
an enlightening introduction to the kinds of pianos Brahms
knew and to the performing style of his time.
   The view of Brahms that emerged from all this was a
revisionist one, namely that Brahms, for all his stubborn
classicism, was really a modernist. This is not exactly a new
notion; both Schoenberg and Charles Ives (probably the two
most daringly innovative composers of the early 20th century)
were profoundly influenced by Brahms, and Schoenberg often
complained that Brahms should really be the one credited with
(or blamed for) destroying tonality.
   But the Bard festival displayed Brahms's modernism in a
novel way by demonstrating just how much greater was Brahms's
compositional reach than other admired composers around him.
One need, for instance, only hear Joachim's long-winded
"Hungarian" Violin Concerto from 1861 to appreciate the sheer
originality of the Brahms First Piano Concerto, written in
the same key (D minor) and around the same period. Brahms's
friend may have been a great violinist, but his 45-minute
concerto, for all its spectacular solo writing, removes the
folk flare from its Hungarian themes as it develops them with
sober Teutonic conventionality.
   Joachim's compositional stodginess was also felt in the
version of Brahms's Fourth Symphony that Botstein conducted.
The violinist apparently had encouraged Brahms to add four
bland opening bars to the symphony, thus placing that
extraordinarily expressive opening in the most commonplace
frame.
   In fact, of all the forgotten works that the festival
exhumed -- including an amiable but blandly academic string
quartet by Robert Fuchs; a couple of moody, atmospheric
overtures to Shakespeare plays by Joachim and Robert
Volkmann; and some well-wrought but not distinctive songs by
Clara Schumann -- only one proved really memorable. The
massive Piano Sonata, Op. 10, by Eugen d'Albert, written in
1893, had a kind of flamboyant Lisztian rhetoric but with
Brahms's rich harmonies, and it ended with one of the biggest
and most impressive triple fugues in 19th-century piano
music.
   But if so much second-rate music -- or second-rate Brahms,
such as the clunky original version of the First Piano Trio
rather than the eloquent revision that is normally played --
sounds like it might have been tiresome, it never was. Mr.
Botstein programmed the music in ways that always proved
illuminating, especially by offering the Joachim and Brahms
D-minor concertos on succeeding evenings, or pairing the
Fuchs quartet with Brahms's late Second String Quintet. And
he talked the music up so well that he created a real sense
of anticipation for hearing it.
   Most important, however, is that Mr. Botstein's enthusiasm
spread to the performances. The festival made use of fine
local talent, an orchestra of excellent New York
free-lancers, and a handful of imported soloists. Two
soloists were major discoveries. Todd Crow, a pianist who
teaches at Vassar, performed the d'Albert sonata and Brahms's
"Handel" Variations with stunning control and a wonderful
sense of musical architecture. Milagro Vargas, an American
mezzo-soprano who was until recently a member of the
Stuttgart Opera, gave an alluring recital that included
comparative text settings by Brahms and other composers.
   Mr. Botstein's performances, notably of the Joachim and
Brahms concertos and Brahms's Fourth Symphony, were solid and
spirited. He is not a particularly supple conductor, but he
has plenty of drive and he achieved interesting orchestral
balances from a Brahms-sized orchestra of about 60. The
concerto soloists were flashy virtuosos -- the violinist
Elmar Oliveira in the Joachim, the pianist Yefim Bronfman in
the Brahms -- and both played spectacularly.
   In his introduction to the festival, Mr. Botstein
suggested that Brahms and Robert Schumann's wife, Clara, were
so close that their relationship must have been consummated.
There is no evidence for this view, and Clara Schumann's
biographer, Nancy Reich, dismissed it at another pre-concert
talk. But happily Mr. Botstein projected his vital image of a
flesh-and-blood Brahms onto his festival's performances.

<LP>
   U.S. policy in the Gulf is at a critical point. President
Bush has forged an unprecedented consensus to preserve Saudi
Arabia's territorial integrity, regional stability, and the
international legal order. To secure these ends however, he
and Congress must face crucial strategic, tactical and policy
issues, including:
   -- What is the most effective and least costly way to get
Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   -- What if the United Nations embargo does not work well
enough or soon enough?
   -- Should we accept an outcome that leaves Saddam Hussein
in place, with his weapons of mass destruction?
   -- How do we pay for the Gulf operation?
   America's success, and its international stature, will
turn on how well these and other issues are handled. Yet,
with the stakes so high and with such difficult issues to
resolve, the nation and the world -- including Saddam Hussein
-- are about to witness what has since 1973 become a needless
and destructive American ritual. Instead of focusing
exclusively on how to succeed in this historic venture,
Congress and the president are likely, because of the War
Powers Resolution, to waste valuable time on a wholly
artificial set of questions having no utility whatsoever in a
process that poses real risks to the nation's interests.
   A brief review of the likely questions should convince us
that it would be absurd to engage in a debate of Congress vs.
the president instead of the world vs. Iraq. One can only
hope that Congress is ready for the first time since the
resolution was adopted to agree to a compromise in which
neither side loses face.
                                                                                                       

   -- Did the president have legal authority to send some
100,000 armed Americans -- with planes, ships, tanks, etc. --
to the Gulf without first obtaining Congress's approval?
   Presidents have ordered the armed forces into combat many
times during the past 200 years to protect American citizens,
interests, and friendly states that request our assistance.
Section 2(c) of the War Powers Resolution, however, purports
to limit the president's authority to commit forces "only
pursuant to (1) a declaration of war, (2) specific statutory
authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack
upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or
its armed forces." None of these bases for action was present
when President Bush acted, so some legislators and
commentators are certain to question the president's conduct.
                                                                                                       

   -- Did the president adequately consult with Congress?
   Section 3 of the resolution requires the president to
consult with Congress in every possible instance before
introducing U.S. armed forces into hostilities or "imminent"
hostilities. President Bush concluded that the situation was
not one in which hostilities existed or were imminent. In
fact, as he noted, sending troops reduced the possibility of
hostilities. He decided nonetheless to consult, because he
properly believes in consulting even when the resolution does
not require it. On the day troops were sent, with Congress
out of session, the president notified congressional leaders
of his plans, including House Speaker Thomas Foley, Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell and Minority Leader Robert
Dole. Additional briefings have continued, including a
marathon session for about 150 legislators.
   Despite the overwhelming support expressed by legislators
for the president's action, some have already claimed the
consultation afforded was inadequate because many more
legislators should have been contacted, and because all
should have been asked what they thought, not merely informed
of the president's decision.
                                                                                                       

   -- Was the president's report to Congress adequate?
   Section 4 of the resolution requires the president to
submit a written report to Congress within 48 hours of
introducing American forces into hostilities or imminent
hostilities; or (with some exceptions) into a foreign
territory "while equipped for combat." The president promptly
submitted a report to Congress "consistent with" the
resolution, but some will complain that the report should
have been based on the introduction of U.S. armed forces into
a situation of imminent hostilities. They will make this
claim, despite the demonstrated correctness of the
president's prediction, simply because they want to treat the
resolution's deadlines for legislative approval as having
commenced at the time the report was filed.
                                                                                                       

   -- Will the president's authority to use the armed forces
in Saudi Arabia terminate automatically, unless Congress
specifically authorizes their continued deployment?
   Congress will undoubtedly approve the president's action
by paying for it through increased appropriations, and
through resolutions of support. Indeed, the Senate on Aug. 2
adopted (97-0) a resolution commending the president for his
initial steps and urging him "to act immediately, using
unilateral and multilateral means to seek the full and
unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti
territory," and the House passed a resolution condemning the
Iraqi invasion and calling for an economic embargo against
Iraq.
   The War Powers Resolution provides, however, that the
president must withdraw all U.S. forces from any situation of
actual or imminent hostilities within 60 days (extendable to
90) unless Congress specifically authorizes continued
deployment. This provision places pressure on Congress to
authorize a deployment with an explicit reference to the
resolution, and for a specific period of time, even though
Congress will already have approved the operation in other,
legally sufficient ways, and despite the fact (as Sen.
Mitchell explained to reporters) that no one could
responsibly place a time limit on the operation at this
point.
   It should be alarming that the U.S. government should turn
to such War Powers questions at so critical a time. Yet, in
the debates that are likely to occur soon, some legislators
will claim that, unless the resolution's terms are
"enforced," Congress will lose its proper authority over
war-making. Nonsense. Congress can no more lose its enormous
power over war than it can deprive the president of his
proper authority.
   President Bush has consulted with and reported to Congress
on his actions -- not because of the resolution, but because
he believes it is proper and essential to do so under our
constitutional system. While he rejects the purported limits
on his authority contained in the War Powers Resolution, he
fully accepts the fact that he cannot act in the Gulf without
Congress's approval and support.
   If Congress were to disapprove his actions, he could not
possibly continue them, just as President Nixon could not
continue the war in Vietnam and President Ford was forced to
discontinue his efforts to prevent a communist takeover of
Angola. Congress, in short, has the power to stop the
president without the War Powers Resolution. What the
resolution purports to do is enable Congress to stop the
president and force an end to the deployment simply by
failing to act.
   What can be done? Legislative reform seems hopeless at
this point. A constructive proposal advanced two years ago by
Sens. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) and John
Warner (R., Va.) got nowhere, because any change in the
resolution is regarded by some in Congress as a capitulation
to the executive. The resolution has, however, over the years
been amended in practice in several respects.
   The president is now widely assumed, for example, to have
power to commit U.S. armed forces abroad in situations not
explicitly approved in the resolution, and the resolution's
legislative veto provisions are assumed to be invalid. On the
other hand, presidents have uniformly consulted Congress and
filed reports in all situations potentially involving the use
of force, even when not required to by the resolution's
terms.
   Perhaps our leaders could craft another de facto reform by
addressing the really tough issues raised by the Gulf
operation and approving the operation without imposing
artificial deadlines or referring explicitly to the
resolution. The president could then approve Congress's
action, and affirm its role in military affairs, without
denying the resolution's validity. Any such development
should be welcome to all who want to focus on the real issues
and avoid this pointless diversion.

   Fox TV Network,
   Cable Operator
   Sign Agreement

   NEW YORK -- The Fox television network signed an agreement
with cable-system operator Tele-Communications Inc. that will
establish a new kind of Fox affiliate station on small cable
systems where the upstart network doesn't have a presence.
   The pact between Fox Broadcasting Co., a unit of News
Corp.'s Fox Inc., and Tele-Communication marks the first time
a broadcaster and a cable operator, traditional rivals for
viewers, have cooperated to form cable-based affiliates of
the network. It could eventually let Fox expand its reach to
an additional 800,000 homes now covered by
Tele-Communications's cable systems, which reach a total of
more than 11 million homes when minority partnership are
included.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fox, which is about to expand its three-night lineup to
five nights a week of prime-time programming, now covers only
91% of all U.S. homes with television sets, compared with 99%
coverage by its Big Three rivals. Fox officials hope the
reach could grow to perhaps 95% in a few years by signing up
additional cable operators to similar arrangements.
   "The same reasons that Tele-Communications would want to
do this hold true of all cable operators in the industry,"
said Fox Broadcasting President Jamie Kellner. He said it
would take perhaps six months to get the new Fox cable plan
"up and running."
   Expanding Fox's coverage could be lucrative. The fledgling
network took in an estimated $550 million in orders for
commercials in the recent "up-front" market and may top $600
million in total revenue for the coming year. If Fox can
widen its reach by, say, 5%, its ad sales could rise by a
similar amount, taking in another $30 million.
   Neither partner in the pact would disclose how much money
it would cost Fox to start the new cable affiliates, or how
much in total fees Tele-Communications may pay to Fox to
carry the programming. Fox will have the option of selling
local commercials for some systems. In others,
Tele-Communications will sell local ads and pay Fox a monthly
fee of six cents per household for the programming.
   By some estimates Fox may have to pay a few million
dollars extra to beam the programming to cable operators. Fox
officials are hopeful that the local ads that Fox sells on
the local cable systems will be enough to offset the extra
costs, and that fees collected from Tele-Communications
systems would be all profit.
   Broadcasters often shun ties to cable operators, in part
because the proliferation of channels has cut heavily into
the big networks' nightly audience. But cable has been
critical to the emergence of Fox as a fourth network. Over
80% of Fox's 117 stations can be found in snowy UHF country,
on channels in the 20s, 30s and 40s. Cable systems give Fox's
UHF stations far better reception.
   Fox research vice president Andrew Fessel spotted cable
early on as a potential ally. His prodding made Fox a
"cable-friendly" entity and prompted the search for
arrangements like the Tele-Communications agreement, said
Fox's Mr. Kellner.
   Network affiliates normally might be expected to oppose
establishing new stations on cable systems. But the Fox
affiliate board has endorsed the new plan because it would
create cable-based Fox channels only in markets that are too
tiny to support the establishment of a fourth over-the-air
television channel. If a would-be Fox station does start up
in one of the small markets, the cable-based affiliate would
drop the Fox programming to avoid draining viewers, said
Robert Thomson, a Tele-Communications vice president.

   Scientists Find Gene
   That Causes a Form

   BOSTON -- Researchers here reported the discovery of a
faulty gene that causes an inherited form of cardiomyopathy,
a disease that thickens the walls of the heart and can cause
sudden death.
   Cardiomyopathy recently came to national attention when it
caused the death of Loyola Marymount University basketball
star Hank Gathers, who collapsed March 4 during a game. The
disease, which can stem from viral infection, alcohol abuse
and other factors besides faulty genes, can cause irregular
heartbeat, decreased cardiac pumping power and heart failure.
The cause of Mr. Gathers's cardiomyopathy hasn't been
identified.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest finding pinpointed the gene behind a rare,
inherited form of the disease and should enable scientists to
develop a genetic test to diagnose it early in such cases.
That may enable doctors to mitigate the disease with drugs --
there presently is no cure for it. Researchers also hope the
finding eventually will help them develop better treatments
for cardiomyopathy.
   An international team of scientists led by Harvard Medical
School researchers Christine and Jonathan Seidman reported
that the gene responsible for the inherited cardiomyopathy
produces a heart muscle protein called the myosin heavy
chain. Myosin plays a central role in muscle tissue's ability
to contract. "It was very much a surprise that the myosin
gene" was involved in the disease, said Christine Seidman, a
cardiologist. "One doubted that a molecule as critical as
that (could be faulty) and still permit survival."
   The researchers, who reported their discovery in today's
issue of the journal Cell, found that different families in
which inherited cardiomyopathy occurs have different defects
in the myosin gene. The genetic basis of the disease is
further complicated by recent findings that show genetic
defects not involving myosin can also cause cardiomyopathy,
Dr. Seidman said.

   Travel:
   Airlines Concede
   Ticketing Chaos
   Could Recur

   The nation's airlines may be running out of computer power
on the days when travelers need it most -- right in the thick
of fare wars.
   Last week, the industry's reservation systems nearly
crashed under the burden of a deluge of travelers trying to
book discount fares. After initially insisting the incident
was just a fluke, industry officials now concede that such
outages -- which can cripple the travel plans of millions --
may well recur on peak demand days, when airlines set
deadlines for their best discounts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though most travelers know little about them, the computer
systems are virtually the lifeblood of the airline industry.
The computers, among the most complex and largest in the
world, are tapped into more than 100 million times a day by
travelers and travel agents seeking flight and fare
information and processing tickets. If they aren't working
properly for even brief periods, the entire travel industry
can be thrown into pandemonium.
   "The systems are really what give people access to the
airline transportation system," says Theodore Harris, a
travel consultant in McLean, Va. "Take that access away, and
you've got chaos."
   The outage on Aug. 29, for example, deprived thousands of
travelers of a special fare discount that expired that day.
It tied up airline phone lines for hours and forced many of
the nation's 35,000 travel agencies to work through the night
writing tickets.
   To a large degree, the mounting strain is a result of the
travel boom of the 1980s. Airline boardings have more than
doubled since airline deregulation, and the number of travel
agencies has tripled in 10 years. They provide far more
services that strain the reservation systems, such as 24-hour
fare check and pre-boarding passes. And because fare
discounts are so widespread, many new travelers price-shop
continually -- which further taxes the reservation systems.
   But airlines are also responsible for the strain because
they set up the mind-boggling fare system that prompts
travelers and agencies to price shop. The industry changes
domestic fares more than 200,000 times each day, so a $99 New
York to Miami fare may be available one minute but gone the
next.
   Critics say the airlines may have planned inadequately for
the growth in travel demand, in part because they enjoy a
near-monopoly status over the reservation system. Currently,
four systems dominated by six U.S. carriers process virtually
all U.S. airline reservations.
   "They can live with having an occasional outage when they
know they have little competition," says Michael E. Levine,
dean of Yale's School of Organization and Management and a
former top official for the Civil Aeronautics Board. "But
they might think twice if they had thought they'd lose
customers."
   The functioning of the reservation systems has
implications beyond travel, since the airlines have long led
the way in solving the most complex problems of commercial
computing. Technology originally used by airlines has rippled
into many other industries that handle complex transactions
at dizzying speeds, including banking, retailing and
insurance. As these industries accelerate their automation,
they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the kind of
business disruption the airlines faced last week.
   That disruption was fueled by a rush of travelers trying
to buy some leisure fare discounts that expired on Aug. 29,
as well as to avoid a 5% fuel surcharge that went into effect
the next day. Airlines initially said their systems didn't
come close to crashing, but they now concede that some
computers shut down or were brought down because of the
overload.
   At the nation's largest reservation system, American
Airlines' Sabre, the computers came so close to crashing that
a quarter of the system -- or about 12,000 terminals at
travel agents, airports and reservations centers across the
country -- had to be shut down for up to half an hour to
store up more power. "What we had was like a brown-out
situation," says Max Hopper, American's senior vice president
of information systems. Another major system, System One,
said its main computer -- which handles 40% of its
transactions -- shut down and had to be restarted because of
the crunch.
   Airlines stress that they can easily handle the
reservation load on normal days and that the circumstances on
Aug. 29 -- two fare deadlines -- were somewhat unusual. But
"with the way the industry is growing, it can definitely
happen again," says Bill Mowery, a senior consultant for
System One, a unit of Continental Airline Holdings Inc.
   In fact, the industry has already suffered other, smaller
overloads in the past year and a half. Sabre went on the
blink for 12 hours last year because of a software failure.
That crippled the operations of 14,000 agents that subscribe
to Sabre and forced the airline to operate with little
information about booking and seating.
   Airlines say they could avoid future bottlenecks by
beefing up their artillery of computers. But most carriers
are reluctant to make big investments to prevent rare
outages; just one mainframe computer for a reservation system
can cost more than $10 million. "We have the capability to
prepare for any crunch," says Mr. Mowery, "but it may not be
something we want to pay for."
   Some critics also think the systems would run more
smoothly if they were in the hands of independent outsiders.
A bill before Congress would require airlines to sell off
their reservation systems.
   Yale's Mr. Levine has also suggested that the industry
could make its system more flexible by giving travel agents
access to all four major reservation computers. Currently,
airlines essentially force most agents to use one system at a
time, and charge the agents per transaction. These and other
fees can be quite lucrative; Sabre had a 27% operating profit
margin in 1988, the last year for which figures are
available, while the airline's profit margin was only 9%.
   "We're talking about a cash cow here, and the airlines
don't want to give that up," says Hal Hensley, a Dallas-based
management and data processing consultant.

   FARNBOROUGH, England -- Juergen E. Schrempp, the
45-year-old chairman of Daimler-Benz AG's Deutsche Aerospace
AG unit, has spent eight months stitching four disparate West
German aerospace companies into a cohesive whole.
   Now, his handiwork is on display to the world.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Deutsche Aerospace is here at the big biennial show taking
up at least half the space in the German pavilion with its
airplanes and a plush hospitality chalet.
   It is a heady time for the four companies involved, each
of which is at least 50%-owned by Deutsche Aerospace, which
was establshed in May 1989 to embrace Daimler's aerospace
activities. Placed together, Deutsche Aerospace's product
range is vast and its potential appears enormous.
   The four companies involved are: Dornier G.m.b.H., a maker
of small aircraft; Motoren &amp; Turbinen-Union G.m.b.H., known
as MTU, which makes engines; defense contractor
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., known as MBB; and
Telefunken Systemtechnik G.m.b.H., a maker of defense
electronics gear.
   Deutsche Aerospace is participating in the building of
Airbus Industrie jetliners, engines from United Technologies
Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit in the U.S., a proposed
Eurofighter project, radar systems, the Tornado fighter,
medical systems and helicopters. Besides MBB, Airbus
Industrie's partners are Aerospatiale of France, British
Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.
   "If you're not one who can say, `I can do everything,' you
don't get the juicy piece of the steak," Mr. Schrempp says.
   But the banquet hasn't quite begun. Although mighty
Daimler-Benz has made progress in reorganizing its new
aerospace acquisitions, the project is far from complete.
Until it is, Deutsche Aerospace will find it difficult to
bite into the meaty military, airliner and helicopter
projects the world's aerospace concerns are increasingly
doing in partnerships.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Schrempp says, the continuing work means
"we are bringing much more to the table" than when the four
companies were small, lacking in resources and participating
in industrial ventures only on an ad hoc basis.
   Today, "there is no company in the world that is going to
make a plane on its own," he says. "But we want to take a
lead" in such partnerships. And only as the larger, richer
and more-focused Deutsche Aerospace can German industry
approach such ventures as equals of U.S. defense companies
or, closer to home, of British Aerospace, Aerospatiale S.A.
and Aeritalia S.p.A.
   Hence the announcements at the show that Deutsche
Aerospace is talking to partners about joint helicopter
projects in Europe and the U.S. and about a European regional
jetliner. The company also reiterated that its wide-ranging
discussions with the Mitsubishi Group of Japan are
continuing.
   But it is a big job to amalgamate four companies and to
strive for synergies with Daimler-Benz, which itself has been
reorganized. "We have made a good start but we aren't
finished," Mr. Schrempp says. "At some levels, we are very
thin. Elsewhere, we have to reduce the bureaucracy. We have
to restructure the production side. Dornier and MBB were
fierce competitors. Now, they have to be friends."
   On the organizational chart, the plan is to regroup
activities among the four companies by functions. Thus,
Dornier's airplanes and MBB's participation in Airbus will be
grouped into the aircraft division, while pieces of various
companies' satellite and space activities will be funneled
into the space division. The other two divisions are defense
systems and propulsion systems.
   The cleanup exercise also means minority holdings in two
Deutsche Aerospace companies must be sorted out. The state of
Hamburg recently swapped its 7% stake in MBB for a piece of
Deutsche Aerospace, Mr. Schrempp said. But Bremen and Bavaria
still hold 24% of MBB. Bremen has said it wants to sell its
shares, but a sale or swap will have to be organized with
Bavaria. Likewise, Deutsche Aerospace is in talks with
members of the Dornier family -- who hold 18% of the voting
rights and 46% of equity in Dornier -- to win the freedom to
manage the company.
   There are other details to attend to. At the end of 1996,
Deutsche Aerospace must buy Bonn's 20% stake in Deutsche
Airbus, the MBB unit that participates in Airbus Industrie.
But that sale is conditional on a number of things, including
Airbus becoming a corporation instead of a murky grouping of
industrial interests.

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Production of raw steel in West
Germany in August fell 12% to 3.1 million metric tons from
3.6 million tons a year earlier, continuing a trend evident
through the year, the Federal Statistics Office said. A
metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
   The August output represented a daily production rate of
108,035 metric tons, down from a daily rate of 122,368 tons a
year earlier. Both months had 29 production days.

   The Americas:
   Will Mexico's Ruling Party Liberalize
   Along With the Economy?

   MONTERREY -- The reorientation to market policies in the
Mexican economy appears to be a successful reform for Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. In the political arena,
however, no such major reorientation or reform has yet taken
place, unless . . . internal changes initiated by Mexico's
ruling party at a conference held this week start a new
political era -- one more in tune with Mexico's liberalized
economy.
   The XIV National Assembly of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) was concluded on Monday. Five
important changes were made to internal party processes. If
taken seriously, they could improve the party's chances for
creating -- and then surviving -- a political opening.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps foremost in importance is a move to substitute the
traditional handpicked candidate-selection process for a more
democratic one; the election of candidates through direct
voting for local party heads, local congressmen, mayors and
even "some" governors. Because being appointed a PRI
candidate was the sure way of holding office, the internal
selection of PRI candidates has been more important than the
electoral process itself; election-day votes could be won or
fabricated, but the candidacy only could be chosen by
appointment.
   In the past two decades, the selection of PRI candidates
gradually was centralized to Mexico City until it became the
favorite way to repay high-echelon capital city bureaucrats
for their services. It also was the only way to an elected
political position in a particular province. Anyone serving
in the capital city who had the remotest personal or family
ties to a provincial city or state automatically became that
city's political candidate, even if he was unknown to the
voters in the area.
   This created rancor among local voters and homegrown
politicians (those in the opposition as well as local members
of the PRI), who were left in the observer's role. They
simply awaited the news from Mexico City as to whom would be
elected candidate for the PRI and therefore become the next
mayor, governor or senator.
   As just one example, PRI loyalist Pedro Zorrilla became
governor of Nuevo Leon in 1973 after being away from the
state for 23 years. He never participated in a single
election and quickly faded from the state scene once his
appointed governorship was over.
   This centralist method of choosing candidates has led
citizens to the conclusion that they are not well
represented. Voter disenchantment has led to apathy, which,
in turn, has resulted in high voter abstentionism. On
occasion, that abstentionism has reached levels of 85%, as in
last month's elections in provincial cities such as San Luis
Potosi.
   Another important change at the PRI assembly has to do
with allowing individual affiliation to the party without
having to affiliate through "sectors." The dinosaurs -- as
the old party and union bosses affectionately are known --
had organized the PRI in the form of the "worker," "peasant"
and "popular" sectors; if you wanted to be in politics, you
had to affiliate yourself officially with one of these
sectors. That meant joining the PRI union affiliated with
that sector and effectively bestowing power on the leaders of
that sector. Only in May of this year, the PRI came out with
the results of its first census of affiliates. Statistics in
hand, Secretary General Luis Donaldo Colossio proclaimed the
PRI as the world's largest political party.
   But with a claimed membership of 13 million, 35% of the
qualified Mexican voters, one wonders why even competent
candidates such as President Salinas in 1988 had difficulties
at the ballot box. Ever since the President's close election,
much soul-searching and brainstorming has taken place. One of
the conclusions at the assembly is that forced affiliation is
not a very effective way to get favorable ballots, hence the
move to voluntary affiliation.
   Another interesting change was to eliminate the position
of "delegado", a centrally imposed state chief. Every couple
of years a new delegate was sent from Mexico City to each of
the 31 states. This delegado was the de facto local chief and
the conduit for instructions to and from Mexico City. In the
great majority of cases the delegados did not know the people
and the issues in each community; many of them spent a few
nights a week in local hotels, returned home to the capital
and viewed their jobs as a steppingstone to other jobs. The
idea now is to allow each state to elect its own officials
and design its own political action plan in order to allow
the PRI to be more territorially oriented, more responsive to
local needs.
   Yet another interesting element was the disappearance of
IEPES, the party's political and intellectual arm for central
planning. The declaration of principles also was amended to
include careful wording about the fostering of private-sector
participation for a competitive economy. A
better-late-than-never amendment, now that the government has
been headed in that direction for the past two years.
   When the assembly was announced, different schools of
thought became evident once again: the "corriente critica",
risk-takers who thought that there should be a planned
abandonment of the PRI (the more radical of whom called for a
complete break with the past); the reformists, who called for
a gradual restructuring and internal democratization; and the
old dinosaurs, who viewed the young political class of Mexico
as incapable of successfully abandoning or restructuring the
party and wanted simply to preserve old methods with, of
course, the accompanying privileges.
   With the impetus from economic success behind the current
regime's liberalization process, the tide now seems to be
going in the direction of controlled reform -- far enough to
create expectation, close enough to preserve control.
   Of course, as is usual in these events, the assembly was
full of rhetoric and hard-to-read statements in more than 500
speeches. Thus it is difficult to predict whether these
changes will come about quickly. Mexico has a history of
implementing change in asymmetrical ways. It is parsimonious
and slow in changing when that involves lessening the power
of the central bureaucracy. And it is quick to act when the
need is to grow in the direction of control.
   Whatever pace political change takes in Mexico, there will
be a couple of interesting benchmarks along the way:
elections this fall in the states of Sonora and Nuevo Leon,
home states for PRI head Colossio and President Salinas,
respectively. If Mexico's road to democracy does indeed start
with the PRI itself, these would be the ideal times and
places to start.

   IBM Is Entering
   Software Venture
   With Metaphor

   International Business Machines Corp. announced a joint
venture with Metaphor Computer Systems Inc. to produce an
underlying layer of software that they hope will speed
development of personal-computer software applications.
   The software industry would welcome any progress: Slow
development of software is often cited as holding back sales
of both software and hardware in the computer industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, there is a bewildering array of software
and hardware "environments" competing for the affections of
companies that develop software applications. Thus, some
companies may see the IBM-Metaphor venture as simply
confusing issues further by adding yet another software
environment. In any case, the venture's software won't be
available for a couple of years.
   "I think the venture is interesting. I think it's worth
watching. I think Metaphor has very good software
interfaces," said Michele Preston, a securities analyst at
Cowen &amp; Co. "But it's going to take some time, and as we all
know the number of changes that can take place in the
(software) world in two years is enormous."
   The two companies will take advantage of some advances in
a fairly new type of programming, called object-oriented
programming. Among other things, object-oriented work lets
programmers re-use sections of code that others have already
written and makes it easier for programmers to update
existing software. Steven P. Jobs's Next Inc. workstations,
for example, run software developed in an object-oriented
environment, and software developers have described that
environment as the most innovative and welcome feature of the
machines.
   The software will be designed for use with either the OS/2
or Unix operating system -- a layer of software that controls
the basic operations of a computer. The software won't mean
that someone using an OS/2-based application on a PC could
use it on a workstation using a Unix application. But it
should make it easier for a programmer to translate software
from one operating system to the other.
   David Liddle, chairman of closely held Metaphor, Mountain
View, Calif., said that as many as 200 programmers will be
involved in the effort. He said IBM will sell the software on
its own machines, while Metaphor will have the right to sell
the software to other hardware makers.

   Mr. Gorbachev
   Puts a High Price
   On His Smiles

   Shortly after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, a senior U.S.
official visiting Moscow was startled to hear a Soviet
counterpart say, "This guy is another Hitler. You have to do
something about him."
   You? At this weekend's Bush-Gorbachev summit in Helsinki,
we may all learn the Soviet asking price for letting us do
something.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nobody's talking for the record, but outlines of a
potential post-Cold War deal are apparent: Mr. Gorbachev
pulls his military advisers out of Iraq, joins the U.N.
military blockade and privately suggests he'd look the other
way if George Bush acts militarily against Saddam Hussein.
   In a cash-pro-quo, Mr. Bush drops his objections to direct
Western aid and government credit guarantees for Moscow and
to the Soviets joining the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank. Secretary of State Baker and Commerce Secretary
Mosbacher then fly into Moscow, 15 U.S. business leaders in
tow, to symbolize George Bush's support for Mr. Gorbachev.
   Far-fetched? Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman,
tipped the U.S. handout Wednesday, saying that "Soviet
cooperation in the Gulf has impressed us to the point where
we are even more interested in being supportive economically
if we can be." This is the pre-summit carrot; let's hope the
stick will come in private Helsinki discussions.
   Because so far, despite fulsome U.S. praise, the Soviets
are having their vodka and drinking it too. They want to join
the civilized world, but can't totally kick 40 years of Cold
War habits. They've helped by signing onto five U.N.
resolutions, but dragged their feet on using force to enforce
the embargo. Mr. Gorbachev stiffed Iraqi's smooth-talking
foreign minister on a visit to Moscow Wednesday, but a day
earlier Soviet foreign minister Shevardnadze resurrected that
diplomatic zombie, an "international conference" on Palestine
and Israel. This is sand in the gears of anti-Iraq pressure.
   Some 1,000 Soviet military advisers -- the widely cited
figure of 200 is Soviet lowballing -- are still greasing the
Iraqi war machine to kill Americans. The Soviet excuse that
they can't leave without jeopardizing 6,000 other Russians in
Iraq is playing the Kurt Waldheim game -- every country with
hostages for itself. Even Maine Senator William Cohen, hardly
a Cold Warrior, calls it a "fig leaf."
   "They have a real difference of opinion over there,"
explain State's Gorbapologists, plausibly enough. Pravda,
representing the Stalinist apparat, is fighting in public
with Izvestia, which speaks for Gorby. Soviet bureaucrats,
elements in the military and Arabists don't want to repudiate
decades of close ties (and weapons sales) to Iraq so easily.
   But Stephen Sestanovich, a Sovietologist
right-from-the-start about Mr. Gorbachev, is more incisive:
"This has been the pattern of Soviet behavior under
Gorbachev. They see what the traffic will bear. Why apologize
for them?"
   No one doubts that Mr. Gorbachev will come asking for U.S.
aid. He's desperate. He made a previous pitch before the July
economic summit in Houston, but President Bush held firm
against the Kohl-Mitterrand-Gorby pressure. Since then, bread
lines have formed in Moscow, and Boris Yeltsin is lapping his
half-reforms as the elected head of the Russian Republic.
President Gorbachev, never having run for office, badly needs
a victory in the one area he still comfortably controls --
foreign policy.
   Mr. Gorbachev will also play his "Shatalin" card -- named
for Stanislav Shatalin, the Yeltsin ally who is offering a
500-day private-property economic cure. Gorby will tell Mr.
Bush he's committing to this radical surgery this coming
week, even though it's Mr. Yeltsin's initiative. Mr. Shatalin
has long argued that Western aid is critical to provide
consumer goods to help ease the pain caused by freeing prices
and ending subsidies. Gorby may even speak approvingly of an
ongoing IMF study of the Soviet economy -- a study sure to be
highly critical.
   "His main argument will be that his country is getting
committed to a real move to capitalism," adds one U.S.
official and long-time Gorbo-skeptic. "This will weaken the
money-down-the-rathole argument."
   The Soviet leader also knows that other countries have
already tapped into the anti-Iraq cash pipeline. The West
quietly came up with $2 billion for Turkey on short notice.
Egypt will get a $7 billion loan write-off. The Saudis are
receiving the latest-model U.S. tanks and planes. Mikhail the
Mendicant will ask why he can't join the queue.
   If anyone should have an asking price on Iraq, in short,
it's George Bush, not Mikhail Gorbachev. Helsinki illustrates
the assymetry of the new summitry: The U.S. is the only
superpower, and the U.S.S.R. is along for the ride. The
Soviets can obstruct, but only at the cost of jeopardizing
their links to the West. In a sense, Mr. Bush is doing Mr.
Gorbachev a favor even by treating him as seriously as he is
with this summit.
   So if the Soviets are serious about establishing a
post-Cold War order, they should have to choose: The West or
Saddam, the civilized world or the Butcher of Baghdad. Even a
half-friend of our enemy is no friend of ours. If U.S.
taxpayers are to help Soviet mothers buy bread, why shouldn't
Soviet boys be ready to fight with Americans in the sands of
Kuwait?

   Welfare, Not Cowboys, Kills Indians

   MONTREAL -- The Mohawk Indians who spent the summer
blockading one of the four major bridges to the island city
of Montreal, as well as Canada's only transcontinental
passenger train, with AK-47s and hand grenades have holed up
in an alcoholism treatment center on their reservation,
surrounded by Canadian troops. The 100,000 commuters who had
driven an extra two hours a day to get to work and back are
now travelling normally; Indians are no longer being burnt in
effigy by outraged suburbanites in front of the Mohawk
barricades.
   The incident that sparked the unrest -- the attempt of the
town of Oka, just west of Montreal, to build a municipal golf
course near land that Indians claimed as a sacred burial
ground -- is now almost irrelevant. What remains relevant is
the cause that incited Canada's Indians to take up arms in
the first place: resentment at the misery of their daily
lives, a misery they share with their fellow tribesmen across
the American border.

<TEXT>
   If a television camera dared to enter the Montreal
reservation, it would record pathetic scenes of public
drunkenness and family violence set against a background of
unpaved streets, junk strewn vacant lots, abandoned store
fronts and ramshackle houses. Indians die younger than other
Canadians; while alive, they have more disease, less
education and poorer nutrition. Similar statistics could be
reeled off for U.S. Indians.
   The problem isn't money. This year, the average Canadian
Indian family will receive cash and in-kind benefits, above
and beyond those available to other Canadians, worth more
than $60,000. Undisputed Indian land holdings on official
reservations average 60 acres per family. In a claims
settlement proposal offered in April 1990 -- and rejected by
the Indian leadership in July -- each native was to receive
4,000 acres of land and $40,000]
   Because treaty Indians may cross the U.S.-Canada border
freely, many Mohawks have found lucrative careers in
smuggling. One Montreal Indian told a reporter for the
Montreal Gazette that he earns $40,000 a trip smuggling
cigarettes. Mohawk reservations have opened up casinos and
bingo halls. The Mohawk Warriors -- as the gang that controls
this trade calls itself -- will earn an estimated $50 million
this year from these activities.
   Settlements in the U.S. have been even more generous. The
U.S. Congress paid the the tiny California mission tribe at
San Luis Rey $32 million in a water rights dispute. The 5,117
member Salt River tribe of Arizona has received $60 million
to surrender its water rights.
   If all 54 million acres of reservation land in the lower
48 states were divided among all U.S. Indians, each would
have title to 36 acres. In 1971 Alaska Indians were awarded
44 million acres -- an area equal to Massachusetts, Vermont,
New Hampshire, Delaware, Rhode Island, Maine and Connecticut
with Puerto Rico thrown in -- and $1 billion. U.S. Indians
lay claim to an additional 455,000 acres.
   But Indian economic advantages don't buy much. The
Canadian government annually provides 6,000 free new and
renovated houses (and free building lots) for natives, yet
25% of Indian households do not have sewers or septic tanks.
Despite free post-secondary education for Indians, only
18,000 young natives out of a total Indian population of
467,000 will be attending college or university this fall, a
participation rate much lower than it is for Canadians who
must pay for their tuition. Similarly, despite a $1 billion a
year socialized medicine program run just for them, U.S.
Indians are less than half as likely to live past 65 as are
other Americans.
   Natives don't stay in school; 8.5% of U.S. Indians
(compared to 3.6% of all Americans) have five years of
schooling or less; only 7.7% have a college degree or an
advanced degree (compared to the U.S. average of 16.5%). U.S.
Indians don't seek work as aggressively (their labor force
participation rate is 21% below average) nor stay at work as
tenaciously (their unemployment level is twice the average)
as do their neighbors. U.S. Indian families are 63% more
likely to be headed by a single parent; their measured money
income is only 70% of the U.S. average; and they are almost
two and one-half times more likely than non-Indians to live
below the poverty level.
   How can things go so wrong with so much money, land and
other economic resources being thrown at the problem? It's
the paternalistic reservation system, a system common to
Canada and the U.S. alike. Reservations operate on
collectivist principles. Individual Montreal Indians can't
elect their own leaders: Hereditary "clan mothers," an elite
minority with powers denied to other Indians, do it. And clan
mothers may choose those leaders only from another elite
minority, those persons whose ancestry allows them to be
chiefs. Clan mothers also call the shots for New York
Mohawks. Militant warriors rule the Montreal reservation by
force of arms, not due process.
   Nor may individual Indians own property. On reservations,
land ownership and control remains in the hands of
politicians and bureaucrats. Indian land in Canada is owned
by the federal government; the Indians have the use of it,
but may not sell. Similarly, U.S. Indian land is held in
trust by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Indians do not own
their land in their own names, they may not use it in the way
they think best and they may not sell and get money with
which to start businesses.
   As soon as Indians leave the reservation, their problems
dissipate. The poverty and unemployment rates of
off-the-reservation Indians in the U.S. are half of what they
are for reservation Indians. Off-reservation American Indians
are 52% more likely than their reservation brethren to earn
more than $20,000; the percentage with high school degrees is
33% higher and the percentage with telephones is 80% greater.
   The solution for Indians' problems, in other words, is the
same as it is for Eastern Europe's: End reservation
collectivism, privatize the land (perhaps distributing it by
lottery), distribute all remaining cash settlement money to
individuals, cash out to individual Indians the present value
of all special welfare programs, institute democratic
elections with the same rules for representative government
by which the rest of us live and grant Indians full and equal
citizenship, with the same rights and responsibilities as all
other Canadians or Americans. Indian bosses and bureaucrats,
"clan mothers" and armed thugs may not like it, but this
would emancipate Indians from an economic and political
system that doesn't work, and admit them to one that does.

   THE TOKYO CONNECTION

   South American drug rings for the first time have been
caught using a Tokyo connection to launder their cash,
Japanese and U.S. officials said.
   Police have concluded that a Colombian drug syndicate
transferred about $1.8 million through a Japanese bank branch
in Hong Kong and a Swiss bank branch in Tokyo. Japanese
newspapers quoted police as saying the money, which ended up
in a Colombian account at a U.S. bank, was intended for use
by a drug syndicate controlled by a reputed member of the
Medellin drug cartel.
   Authorities disclosed the transaction on the arrival in
Tokyo of U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who is in
Asia to discuss law-enforcement issues with other attorneys
general in the region.
   Mr. Thornburgh said the case "made the point very
graphically" that "any modern, efficient banking institution
is fair game for the process of laundering these billions of
dollars of drug proceeds."
                                                                                                       

   ARGENTINE SALE IS SUSPENDED
                                                                                                       

   An Argentine judge ordered the suspension of the sale of
the state-owned airline Aerolineas Argentinas to a consortium
led by Spain's Iberia because the proposed buyers made the
down payment by letter of credit instead of cash.
Administrative Law Judge Oscar Garzon Funes gave the Public
Works Ministry eight days to explain why it accepted the
letter of credit; he said he would then decide whether to
annul the sale. The consortium agreed last July to buy 85% of
Aerolineas for $260 million and the retirement of $2 billion
of Argentina's foreign debt.
                                                                                                       

   A POSTPONEMENT IN CHINA
                                                                                                       

   China has pushed back the opening of its first futures
market to Oct. 12, representing the latest of a long series
of delays. William Grossman, managing director of the Chicago
Board of Trade's Asia-Pacific office, said in Tokyo that
Beijing decided to postpone the September opening of the
wheat-futures market in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan
Province, because of conflicts arising from the Asian Games,
which begin in China later this month. China, is using the
CBOT as a technical adviser.
                                                                                                       

   GERMAN-SOVIET TRADE
                                                                                                       

   West Germany will reportedly guarantee delivery agreements
of East German companies to the Soviet Union. The Berliner
Morgenpost, a West German newspaper, said that an agreement
being worked on would require both sides to dismantle or
remove "trade barriers of every type" in a step-by-step
fashion. The report said Bonn would even guarantee support
for East German companies that are in precarious financial
condition if they supply important goods to the Soviet Union.
                                                                                                       

   TAIWAN'S GOLD IMPORTS
                                                                                                       

   Concern over the Persian Gulf situation and worries over
rising inflation sent Taiwan's imports of gold and coins
soaring in August, bullion dealers said. Finance Ministry
statistics showed that gold imports totaled 13.24 tons valued
at $163.6 million in August, tripling the 4.27 tons valued at
$51.4 million imported in July. Switzerland was Taiwan's
biggest gold-bar supplier, shipping 8.13 tons of gold to
Taiwan in August.
                                                                                                       

   A DOG REGISTER FOR THE EC?
                                                                                                       

   The European Parliament's environment committee wants a
register set up for the European Community's millions of
dogs. Registering pets could help identify strays and control
the spread of rabies when border checks are abolished,
parliament member Anita Pollack argued. Before entering the
EC, foreign dogs would have to undergo blood tests to certify
they are rabies-free. The register wouldn't replace the
six-month quarantine in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
                                                                                                       

   CONDEMNING ANTI-SEMITISM
                                                                                                       

   Roman Catholic leaders condemned anti-Semitism and racism
as they closed a Catholic-Jewish conference in Prague that
looked at growing anti-Semitic incidents in Eastern Europe.
   A statement issued during the four-day meeting said
delegates from 16 nations gave special attention to "recent
manifestations of anti-Semitism" in former Eastern bloc
nations since the fall of tightly run communist societies.
   The statement came at the end of the first formal meeting
in five years of the Pontifical Commission on Religious
Relations with the Jews and the International Jewish
Committee on Interreligious Consultations. The conference's
plan to fight anti-Semitism includes deleting racially or
religiously divisive material from textbooks and
establishment of courses for priests to counter anti-Jewish
sentiment.
   The plan also called for swift translation and
dissemination of recent Vatican statements on Catholic-Jewish
relations.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Libya has reported its first case of AIDS as the number of
cases world-wide rose by nearly 10,000 in August, according
to the World Health Organization. WHO said in its latest
monthly report there was a total of 283,010 officially
notified AIDS cases in 157 countries in August, up from
273,425 in July. . . . French farmers hijacked a truck
carrying British sheep yesterday near Nyons in southeastern
France and released the animals onto the streets. The
farmers, convinced that imports of low-cost meat are driving
down French prices, have hijacked at least 19 trucks carrying
imported livestock and meat since June.

   PERMANENT PRESENCE? The U.S. quietly lays plans to stay in
Saudi Arabia.
   Despite Saudi statements discounting a lasting U.S. role,
senior Army commanders are developing plans to permanently
station several thousand troops, along with equipment for an
even larger force that could be airlifted in. Details haven't
been approved by the White House and Saudi leaders, but many
Pentagon officials are confident the Saudis would pick up
much of the cost.

   Bush's foreign fund-raising efforts are already broader
than advertised. While the public emphasis is on scraping up
aid to Egypt and Turkey, Baker and Brady are seeking up to
$25 billion, especially in "in kind" contributions such as
jet fuel and supplies, so U.S. troops don't look like
mercenaries getting paychecks from abroad.
   Egypt considers sending thousands of more troops to
address concerns the multinational force is too American.
                                                                                                       

   BUDGET BRINKSMANSHIP grows as negotiators prepare for
weekend talks.
   As congressional leaders and White House aides gather for
talks at Andrews Air Force Base, Democrats remain divided on
whether a budget stalemate and soft economy would hurt or
help their candidates this fall. Bush could use his Tuesday
night speech to Congress to criticize them if no progress is
made.
   Meanwhile, agencies outdo each other in sketching doomsday
scenarios for Oct. 1 if no deal is reached. The FBI says it
would lay off 2,700 agents and 3,500 other employees. HHS
says 1.6 million children would go unvaccinated. The SEC
warns employees they'd be furloughed two days a week.
                                                                                                       

   IRAQ EMERGES as a political issue in several Senate and
House races.
   Republicans Senate challengers rush to make hay: Michigan
nominee Scheutte blasts Sen. Levin for opposing
rehabilitation of the battleship Wisconsin, now on guard in
the Gulf; Iowa's Tauke and Montana's Kolstad blast opponents
Harkin and Baucus as soft on defense before the crisis. But
the crisis may help Foreign Relations Committee Democrats
Pell and Simon.
   The issue also flares up in several House races. Virginia
Democratic candidate Moran cites a vote by GOP Rep. Parris
for subsidized food exports to Iraq only days before the
invasion; he threatens to punch Parris for saying that "the
only three people I know who support Saddam Hussein's
position are Moammar Gadhafi, Yasir Arafat and Jim Moran."
   In Maryland, where Democratic Rep. Dyson supports U.S.
action in the Gulf, his primary challenger hits him for his
C.O. status during Vietnam.
                                                                                                       

   LEAD BALLOON: While a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News
poll shows that three-quarters of American voters saw Saddam
Hussein's televised meetings with Western hostages, the
meetings hardly had the desired effect: By an overwhelming
86% to 6%, voters say the meetings harmed rather than helped
his image.
                                                                                                       

   EAST EUROPE'S FUTURE darkens because of cuts in Soviet oil
deliveries, price shocks from economic changes and drought.
While attention is on the Gulf crisis, a State Department
official worries these problems could "derail the reform
efforts or even pull the plug on governments."
                                                                                                       

   BROWN BLUNDERS in allowing the firing of lawyer Stanley
Brand as Democratic Party parliamentarian, party operatives
say. Brand was ostensibly sacked for representing Robert
Thompson, lobbyist for James Fail, whose acquisition of a
Texas thrift is under congressional investigation. But
Brown's own law firm represents Fail -- a fact the chairman's
critics are sure to use against him.
                                                                                                       

   NEXT IN LINE to be federal drug czar, if William Bennett
steps down within a year as rumored, may be Reggie Walton,
Bennett's deputy and a former judge known for tough criminal
sentencing. Walton would have obvious political appeal to the
White House: He is a black law-enforcement enthusiast who has
forged strong ties with state and local officials.
                                                                                                       

   THE SEC nears new enforcement power, but may be
ill-prepared to use it.
   The Senate and House are close to a compromise on
legislation giving the agency new disciplinary power for a
host of misdeeds. But many worry that the SEC has a woefully
thin staff of administrative judges, virtually guaranteeing
long waits for any commission action.
   Some defense lawyers complain that the process will become
stacked against defendants and that the SEC will stop
bringing cases in federal court, preferring to act
internally. "This is the most dramatic change in the federal
securities laws in at least 15 years," says lawyer and former
SEC official Harvey Pitt. "You've completely changed the

   SEC Chairman Breeden argues that the agency's new

   Vitriolic Democratic Primary in Massachusetts
   Offers Classic Stereotypes to Succeed Dukakis

   FALL RIVER, Mass. -- "Do voters really want a governor
angrier than they are?" asks state Rep. Joan Menard, one of a
score of Democratic politicians attending Mayor Carl
Viveiros's 20th annual picnic at Dave's Beach here.
   It's hardly an idle question, for the key figure in this
year's governor's race is John Silber, the 63-year-old
president of Boston University. And Mr. Silber is an angry
man. "He's angry all the time," says Louis DiNatale, senior
fellow at the University of Massachusetts's John McCormack
Institute of Public Affairs. "Now he's got two weeks and a
million dollars to prove he's a moderate and not a maniac."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The conservative Mr. Silber is the magnetic pole in a
three-way race in the Sept. 18 Democratic primary to choose a
candidate to succeed retiring Gov. Michael Dukakis, who may
qualify as the most unpopular incumbent in the nation. Only
two years ago, Mr. Dukakis ran for president boasting of the
Massachusetts Miracle. That economic bubble has burst, with
the state's economy heading down at the same time taxes are
moving up. The voters feel betrayed.
   The three-way race offers standard Democratic stereotypes
with astonishing fidelity. The leader in the polls is former
state Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti, a genial
old-style politician who ran twice before for governor,
losing in 1964 and 1970. He represents the loyal, ethnic,
mostly urban roots of the party so grandly personified by
Killer Kowalski, the former wrestling champion who spoke up
for Mr. Bellotti at Mayor Viveiros's picnic. He is also the
unlikely champion for pragmatic liberals desperate to stop
Mr. Silber, despite the fact that many of those same liberals
aimed elitist barbs and dirty ploys at him in previous
campaigns.
   Mr. Silber, on leave from his $275,000-a-year job at BU,
is a transplanted Texan -- one of his oldest friends is
former House Speaker James Wright -- who heaps abuse on
status quo politics and free-spending politicians, especially
Gov. Dukakis. He voted for Ronald Reagan and George Bush, and
he appeals to suburban independents and disenchanted
Democrats -- but is hampered by a widespread feeling that he
is poorly suited by character and temperament to be governor.
   Also in the race, struggling to raise enough cash to be
competitive, is Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy, a 50-year-old
feminist and environmentalist, who maintains a following
among voters Mr. DiNatale derisively calls the "brie and
save-the-whales folks."
   The pragmatic liberals wish Lt. Gov. Murphy would pull out
of the race and throw her support to Mr. Bellotti; she says
she won't, and instead has gone on the air with a new
television commercial that effectively lambastes Mr. Bellotti
and Mr. Silber for running dirty campaigns. It opens with
shots of oozing, bubbling mud. ("Boston Harbor?" asks the
voice in the commercial. "No, it's the governor's race.") And
then, earlier this week, the lieutenant governor threatened
to seize control of the state as soon as Gov. Dukakis left on
a scheduled foreign trade mission, so she could put through
her own proposals to cure the state's fiscal crisis. The
governor briefly postponed his trip, but he departed
yesterday after receiving assurances that Lt. Gov. Murphy
would act responsibly in his absence.
   Dirty this race has been. And it's no wonder: Mr. Bellotti
and Mr. Silber despise one another.
   Mr. Bellotti on Mr. Silber: "He's sleazy and he's running
low-ball ads. He's an extremely arrogant, elitist guy."
   Mr. Silber on Mr. Bellotti: "He's not really running for
governor. He's running for redemption. He's got lots of
political baggage. His record in prosecuting politicians was
dismal. He was in government 12 years and never did anything.
Bellotti and Dukakis. I keep confusing the two."
   "What we have here," says Paul Kirk, a former Democratic
national chairman, "is almost a unique situation of anger and
frustration among the voters. If that translates to an
attitude -- oh, to hell with it -- Bellotti probably will
win. But if Democrats and independents decide they want to
send a message and turn out in big numbers, look out for
Silber." Independents are eligible to vote in party primaries
in Massachusetts.
   The Republicans are holding a quiet primary in which state
Rep. Steven Pierce is leading former U.S. Attorney William
Weld. Mr. Pierce is running on an anti-abortion, anti-tax
platform; Mr. Weld is running as a moderate and has been
making some headway lately in the polls. A poll by the Boston
Globe and WBZ-TV suggests that either of them could beat any
of the Democratic candidates, but most voters are unaware of
where the two GOP candidates stand on most issues, including
abortion.
   Mr. Silber boasts that he's an outsider, free of ties to
old-style politicians. But Bellotti aides like to point out
that Silber supporters include such insiders as state Senate
President Billy Bulger and former Boston Mayor Kevin White.
Mr. Silber insists he is under no obligation to any of them
and that, in fact, the controversial Mr. Bulger, a
deal-making political boss, "is as high-minded a politician
as I've ever known."
   And while Mr. Silber belabors Mr. Dukakis's performance at
every turn, he has hired several Dukakis aides for his
campaign. They include Jack Weeks, who came up with the idea
during the presidential campaign of putting the governor in
an M-1 tank wearing a helmet, a notion that even Kitty
Dukakis says turned out to be humiliating.
   Given the high state of outrage among the voters here, Mr.
Silber ought to be running well ahead of Mr. Bellotti and Lt.
Gov. Murphy, both of whom have ties with the discredited Mr.
Dukakis. Mr. Silber may still win -- some observers believe
his vote is undercounted in the polls -- but if he does it's
going to be closer than it might have been because he tends
to commit political gaffes.
   "He's made so many of them," says Mr. Bellotti, "that
voters don't think he's funny any more. He's not wearing
well."
   Perhaps Mr. Silber's most celebrated gaffe was his offhand
attempt in a healthcare forum to quote Shakespeare:
"`Ripeness is all,'" he said. "When you've had a long life
and you're ripe, then it's time to go."
   Mr. Bellotti's handlers, led by TV consultant Ray
Strother, saw an opening, and barged through it with a
commercial charging that "John Silber wants to ration health
care for the elderly," as the screen fills with scenes of
happy, healthy older folks working in the garden, playing
handball and reading to their grandchildren. "Time to go?"
asks the voice in the commercial, as the screen shows
close-ups of the smiling faces of these older folks. As
governor, the commercial concludes, "Frank Bellotti will
never desert the elderly. Never. Never. Never."
   Outrageous, says Mr. Silber. "I was talking about
terminally ill people, connected to tubes, gasping for
breath. He {Bellotti} alleges I want to ration health care to
those beautiful, healthy people that appeared in the ads.
It's not true. I have a 95-year-old mother who lives with me
most of the time."
   "Baloney," says Mr. Bellotti. "I know what he said. He
wants to ration health care."
   Mr. Silber's handlers, led by consultant Robert Squier,
struck back with a TV spot that has now become something of a
classic among the cognoscenti who follow nasty negative
advertising. It shows the headline of a Boston Globe story
that analyzed Mr. Bellotti's tepid record as attorney general
in prosecuting political corruption, and neatly turns it into
a suggestion that Mr. Bellotti might be personally corrupt.
   "Questions Linger Over Bellotti's Corruption Record," the
headline reads. "So who do we turn to?" asks the voice in the
commercial, as the ad zeroes in on the word "corruption."
"Bellotti, plagued by questions about his corruption record?"
And then the kicker: "Corruption, the oldest word in the
politics of the past."
   "He {Mr. Silber} took words out of a headline and drew the
inference I was corrupt," says Mr. Bellotti. "It's pure
deception. It's sleazy."
   To counter the ad, Mr. Bellotti held a crowded news
conference at which he produced five live attorneys general,
one from as far away as Michigan, to attest to his
incorruptibility. Others sent their regards.
   Mr. Bellotti's supporters note that the corruption ad is
played out against the fact that Mr. Bellotti's ethnic stock
is Italian, and that there might be a hidden message that he
has mob connections.
   Nonsense, says Mr. Silber. "When I think of Italians, I
think of Rossini, Michelangelo, Marconi, Guardini, Virgil."

   Lotus Is Upgrading 1-2-3 Again;
   Move May Revive Sales, Earnings

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp. is upgrading
its 1-2-3 software -- again.
   Monday, Lotus will start selling 1-2-3 Release 3.1, which
many analysts say is the product it should have introduced 15
months ago when it shipped Release 3.0. Many customers
rejected the upgrade to Release 3.0, contributing to Lotus's
earnings woes and apparently costing it sales to competitors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The lastest revision "is certainly an important step in
the right direction," said Scott Smith, an analyst with
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities. But, "They've lost
momentum. The product is going to have to prove itself in an
increasingly competitive world."
   Lotus could use some rejuventaion. Its stock has fallen
from $34 as recently as July 17 to $18, down 25 cents, in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday. In July it
startled investors by disclosing that third-quarter results
would trail year-earlier earnings rather than rising as
expected.
   The latest upgrade comes at a time when Lotus is facing
tougher competition than ever in the spreadsheet market that
it has dominated since introducing 1-2-3. Lotus 1-2-3
generates about two-thirds of Lotus's revenue and is used by
about 6.5 million people. But software giant Microsoft Inc.,
Redmond, Wash., and the smaller Borland International, Scotts
Valley, Calif., both have been pushing their own spreadsheets
hard for the last two years and they are hurting Lotus,
analysts say. Spreadsheets are software programs often used
to perform financial calculations.
   While spreadsheet market-share estimates are inexact,
several analysts said that Lotus's share has fallen from more
than 70% a year ago to between 60% and 65% today. Lotus
maintains its share of the PC spreadsheet market has slipped
slightly but remains over 70%.
   Nevertheless, Lotus promises to strike back hard. "Every
indication I have is that customers think the (latest)
product is great," said Donald Casey, vice president,
spreadsheet division. In addition to Release 3.0's key
features of three-dimensional spreadsheets and access to
corporate databases, Release 3.1 provides high-quality
printing capabilities. It also works in conjunction with
Microsoft's increasingly popular Windows software, although
it doesn't take advantgae of all Windows features. Yet
another version, expected next year, will do that.
   Lotus plans an unusually aggressive marketing campaign to
build momentum for the new version. Mr. Casey said it will
spend "several million dollars" on advertising. In addition,
it is sending out 1.7 million pieces of direct mail with
product comparisons.
   Release 3.1 has a list price of $595, the same as Release
3.0, but $100 more than older versions. People who have
Release 3.0 can upgrade for $35; those who have the year-old
Release 2.2 can upgrade for $75. And users with older version
can upgrade for $150. However, in a change from past policy,
Lotus will let old users upgrade at some retail computer
stores. Egghead Discount Software, a software chain, plans a
major promotion under which users will be able to upgrade
from older versions at the store for $99.
   Analysts said the shipment of Release 3.1 comes too late
in the third quarter to have much impact, but they said it
should help fourth-quarter results. David Readerman, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton, said he expects Lotus to
report third-quarter net income of about 25 cents a share,
down from $23 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier.
He said revenue will decline to about $152 million from
$153.9 million. Mr. Readerman said that he expects about 45%
of Lotus's revenue will go for sales and marketing, up from
40% in the year-earlier period.
   "The big wildcard is how well is Release 3.1 going to be
accepted, given that the market is standardizing on Windows,"
said Richard Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
Microsoft, which is expected to introduce an upgraded version
of its Excel spreadsheet in November or December, is
trumpeting the advantages of Windows for moving information
among several different programs at once. Peter Higgins, who
heads Microsoft's Excel marketing, said, "A lot of customers
have bought Windows and said, "maybe I should get some real
Windows applications. Lotus 1-2-3 doesn't take advantage of
what Windows has to offer."
   However, many customers who aren't in the Windows fold
said Release 3.1 is just what they need. Brian Cole, computer
systems analyst at the National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, Md., said many of the 5,000 users he helps advise
haven't upgraded 1-2-3 because past upgrades didn't provide
much benefit. However, release 3.1 "will be of interest. It's
what I would recommend," he said.

   Firm Aims Videotapes And
   `White Papers' at Creditors

   DALLAS -- The battle for Greyhound Lines has heated up as
management readies videotapes, "white papers" and other
evidence in an attempt to prove that a striking union seeking
a buy-out has conducted a reign of terror.
   It's all part of management's dogged attempt to win the
hearts and minds of creditors, who ultimately will decide the
fate of Greyhound, currently in the preliminary stages of a
bankruptcy-court filing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And with the threat looming of a buy-out bid organized by
the striking Amalgamated Transit Union, there is a sense of
urgency to the company's campaign.
   Few took the ATU's buy-out proposal seriously until the
union hooked up with Blackstone Group, a New York investment
banking firm, on a possible buyout bid. Blackstone, with its
$800 million buy-out and investment fund, would add muscle to
the ATU's efforts to wrest control of the company from
Chairman Fred Currey, who led a 1987 leveraged buy-out of the
bus line, a unit of GLI Holding Inc.
   With that in mind, Greyhound is anxious to blunt union
efforts to woo creditors; the company wants to maintain the
exclusive right to present a reorganization plan to them.
Greyhound's exclusivity rights expire Oct. 2, but the company
isn't expected to file its reorganization plan until early
November. Thus, Greyhound will need creditor support to seek
an extension. If creditors refuse, the union -- Blackstone
group could have an opening to file a competing plan.
   "They want to keep control of the case," Leigh Walzer, an
analyst with R.D. Smith &amp; Co., said of Greyhound. "They are
very concerned."
   Those worries have spawned a concerted effort to portray
the union as a volatile and unreliable business partner. ATU
President James La Sala may have unwittingly helped that
strategy along with a recent letter to union members stating
that "we intend to continue this fight for as long as it may
take until it is won or the company is destroyed."
   "They have orchestrated and condoned and led violence to
try to enforce economic demands that their employer couldn't
meet," Greyhound's Mr. Currey said in an interview. "I think
the proposition that investors -- Blackstone or otherwise --
would seek to have partnership with them isn't very
probable."
   Union officials, who have condemned the violence and
denied responsibility for it, say they remain confident and
note that Blackstone Group executives will meet with the
presidents of ATU locals on Sunday to discuss details of a
possible joint buy-out bid. But even if a proposal is made,
ATU leaders will face the task of undoing the dark image an
aggressive Greyhound has been painting of them.
   A videotape scheduled for showing to creditors, potential
lenders and the news media details violence during the strike
that began March 2 and includes evidence gathered for a suit
Greyhound filed last April against the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions, the ATU's bargaining unit.
   Filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, the suit seeks $30 million in damages and
accuses the council and various union officials of trying to
extort wages and benefits from Greyhound through violence and
other disruptive acts.
   Employing footage shot by television news crews and
Greyhound security personnel, the videotape contains
sometimes grisly scenes of shootings and assaults, including
one clip of an elderly woman passenger being knocked to the
ground and bloodied by a man identified as a striker.
   Also included are portions of a subpoenaed audio recording
of an early 1990 union meeting in Dallas attended by Edward
Strait, president of the Amalgamated Council. On it, a voice
identified as Mr. Strait's is heard to comment that three
buses that caught fire on a Greyhound lot in Camden, N.J.,
last January, two months before the strike, "got so hot, they
burned up, sitting right in the middle of the lot."
   In an interview, Mr. Strait recalled making such comments
but said he didn't intend to incite violence or indicate that
he knew the source of those fires. "We're not the gangsters
and thugs that Fred Currey says we are," Mr. Strait said.
   Greyhound property and personnel have been the targets of
widespread assaults, shootings and vandalism throughout the
strike. ATU members charged in connection with those
incidents include Fred Ingram, an Amalgamated Council vice
president, who faces assault and battery charges in a
Fayetteville, N.C., county district court trial next month in
connection with an incident there last March.

   Wednesday's decision by a federal judge to hand Franklin
Savings Association of Kansas back to its former officials is
surely one strong sign that the Savings and Loan crisis, bad
enough to begin with, has been poorly handled. And this in
turn tells a lot about the sorry state of the current
economy.
   Back in April, we ran a long editorial on the S&amp;L bailout
titled "Financial Vietnam." One of its subsections was called
"Franklin and Other Blunders." We described how the
Resolution Trust Corp. seized Franklin though it "was a
solvent institution, not likely to go belly-up soon."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We described the Franklin operation, which wasn't a
traditional thrift but an institution that accepted brokered
deposits to finance a portfolio of mortgaged-backed bonds,
and then hedged against interest-rate movements to provide a
guaranteed return. We said this was a way to "distill out the
financial essence" of deposit insurance, and understood why
regulators were disturbed. But by seizing the institution, on
a disagreement about when to recognize paper losses
offsetting paper gains, regulators "have chosen the course of
maximum disruption, maximum cost to the taxpayer, and maximum
risk to the financial system."
   Which is pretty much what the judge ruled. Judge Dale
Saffels understood the hedging technique but said the
regulators "lacked adequate training and understanding to
evaluate" Franklin. There was no reason for regulators to
force Franklin into technical violation of federal capital
requirements. Judge Saffels was unusually qualified to handle
this case; he is past chairman of the board of the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Topeka. Judge Saffels, who explained his
decision to reporters, ordered that the keys to Franklin be
returned to its owners as of 10 a.m. yesterday.
   For nearly seven months, the Office of Thrift Supervision
kept Franklin in limbo. Now, Franklin Chairman Ernest
Fleischer will try to bring back key employees and
depositors. Thrift regulators will appeal the ruling, and
yesterday got a temporary stay order, but there is added
risk.
   Franklin could cite a recent decision by the U.S. Claims
Court that the owners of thrifts wrongly seized by regulators
can bring Fifth Amendment Takings Clause cases; Franklin's
holders of $2.9 billion in zero-coupon bonds forced by
regulators to redeem early also have a claim to compensation.
On top of the costs of the S&amp;L bailout, the Treasury may have
to pay out billions to thrift owners because of overzealous
regulators.
   This case is a reminder that fraud was only a part,
probably a small part, of the S&amp;L disaster. The bigger
problem was the predictable consequence of deposit insurance.
   As it happens, Mr. Fleischer wrote us in April agreeing
with our larger point that there is no justification for a
separate Savings and Loan industry. "In my testimony before
the Senate Banking Committee last year I asserted the very
same thing," Mr. Fleischer wrote. "Furthermore, I suggested
that if the Congress does want to subsidize housing in
America, it should do so through direct transfers to the
needy, not through the thrift industry." This was scarcely
your typical thrift executive urging Congress to boost
deposit insurance to $100,000 an account, the biggest blunder
of the S&amp;L crisis.
   Congress made the original blunder, and also leaned on
regulators to go easy on thrifts. Once freed of this burden,
however, regulators overreacted, throwing potentially viable
thrifts out with fraud-ridden ones. This has served to run up
the costs to the taxpayer, both directly and by needlessly
helping to slow the general economy into its recent torpor.

   A Japanese real estate tycoon's purchase of Pebble Beach

   Minoru Isutani, a Japanese investor and golf course
developer, bought the Pebble Beach, Calif., company from
Miller-Klutznick-Davis &amp; Gray Co., a Denver real estate
partnership anchored by investor Marvin Davis. Terms of the
sale weren't disclosed, but persons familiar with the deal
put the price at more than $800 million and possibly as high
as $1 billion.

   Though it was known in recent weeks that Pebble Beach
assets were for sale, most real estate observers thought that
only a 49% minority interest was available instead of the
entire site.
   Real estate experts say the sale is a notable exception to
recent foreign investing trends in the midst of an unsettled
real estate market and negative publicity prompted by an $828
million Japanese investment in Rockefeller Group Inc. last
year. The Pebble Beach purchase is among the largest foreign
purchases of recreational properties in the U.S.
   "This {deal} is the all-time home run for a real estate
developer," says Kenneth R. Leventhal, chairman of the Los
Angeles accounting firm that bears his name. Even so, he
says, he expects the current trend of Asian investors turning
away from high-profile purchases and toward development
properties to continue. The purchase does illustrate a
growing interest in Western golf properties, Mr. Leventhal
adds.
   Other real estate experts agree. "When you're in a country
where land is at a terrible premium, you have a better
appreciation of it than Americans do," says Sanford R.
Goodkin, executive director of Peat Marwick's Goodkin Real
Estate Consulting in San Diego.
   Technically, Pebble Beach's new owner is Ben Hogan
Properties, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cosmo World USA, in
turn a unit of Mr. Isutani's Cosmo World Corp., based in
Tokyo.
   Thomas A. Oliver, president of the Pebble Beach Co., said
several bidders had been interested in the property, and
negotiations for Cosmo World had gone on for several months.
Mr. Oliver declined to discuss financial details of the
transaction. Calls to Cosmo World's office in Los Angeles
weren't returned, but officials said in a statement that no
changes in management at the property were expected.
   Mr. Isutani, who owns several golf courses in Japan, is
developing golf courses and resorts in Los Angeles; Las
Vegas, Nev.; Hawaii; Tucson, Ariz.; San Francisco; and
Europe. The Tokyo investor has been the subject of recent
Japanese press reports looking at his relationship with
Hisashi Shinto, the former head of NTT Corp. who faces
charges of political bribery.
   The 5,300 acre Pebble Beach site includes the famous
Pebble Beach Golf Links; the Lodge at Pebble Beach; the Inn
and Links at Spanish Bay; Spyglass Hill and Del Monte golf
courses; the 17-mile Drive, a scenic coastal route; and
undeveloped real estate on the Monterey Peninsula, about 110
miles south of San Francisco.
   Included in the sale is the Lone Cypress, a majestic tree
that juts out of a rocky point on the coastal property. The
tree recently caused a widely publicized flap between
professional photographers and the Pebble Beach Co., which
tried to bar unauthorized photos of the tree on the grounds
that it was a trademark item.

   Poll Sees '90 Outlays Rising
   5.4%, Revising Forecast

   WASHINGTON -- Bruised by weakening consumer demand and
deteriorating profits, U.S. businesses are continuing to pare
their capital-spending plans, a Commerce Department survey
shows.
   Responding to questions in July and early August,
businesses said they planned to raise capital spending 5.4%
this year. That compares with the 6.8% increase projected
when they were last asked about their plans, in April and
May, and the 8.1% rise they forecast at the beginning of the
year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The results reflect growing concern about the economy,
which has made businesses increasingly reluctant to commit to
big investments.
   The cutbacks could be sowing the seeds of problems beyond
the capital-goods industries. Economists say curbing
expenditures on new plant and equipment now will impede
future economic growth and efficiency.
   "If we curtail capital spending, we won't be building the
productivity enhancement and the technology to improve
international competitiveness," said Joseph Duncan, chief
economist at Dun &amp; Bradstreet in New York. "I worry we'll
lose that international edge if businesses cut back
investment."
   If businesses follow through on the plans reported on the
survey, 1990 will see a sharp slowdown in capital spending
from recent years' levels.
   U.S. businesses have gone through something of a
capital-spending boom over the past two years. In 1989,
despite evidence of a slowing economy, they bolstered capital
spending by 11.4%; in 1988, the increase was 11%.
   After adjusting for inflation, the planned rise in capital
spending this year would amount to a 5.1% increase from last
year, compared with gains of 10.4% in 1989 and 9.5% in 1988.
   Several important industries are planning actual decreases
in capital spending this year, according to the report,
including the auto industry and makers of nonelectrical
machinery, a category that includes computers.
   But auto makers aren't planning nearly as big a cut as
they were at the start of the year. In the July-August
survey, car manufacturers expected spending on new plant and
equipment to slip just 0.6% this year, compared with planned
declines of 6% in the April-May survey and 11.2% in the
January-March survey.
   The industries planning the biggest increases are paper,
electrical machinery and nonferrous metals.
   The Commerce Department surveys were mailed to businesses
June 30 with an Aug. 1 due date. Although some weren't
returned until mid-August, most of the responses were made
before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, which has threatened
the economy by driving up world oil prices.
   Surveys are already showing that consumer confidence has
plummeted in the wake of spiraling oil prices. Some analysts
believe businesses also may become increasingly nervous about
the economic outlook, and that could curb capital spending
further.
                                                                                                       

   Here is the breakdown by major industries of capital
spending results for past periods and estimates for current
and future periods. For comparability with annual totals, the
quarterly figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates, in
billions of dollars:

   Law:
   Killings Spur Bid to Require
   Crime Data From Colleges

   The recent slayings of five college students in
Gainesville, Fla., have focused new attention on a legal
effort to compel schools to disclose campus crime statistics.
   The U.S. Senate this month will consider a bill that would
require all post-secondary institutions that receive federal
aid to publish annual security reports that include the
number of violent crimes committed against students. The
report would be distributed to students and university
employees. Prospective applicants could receive the
information upon request.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "People are looking at the Florida tragedy and realizing
this is a serious problem," says a Senate aide familiar with
the bill. "We tend to look at higher institutions as idyllic
places, but they can be dangerous environments. Too many
people go off to college not thinking about it."
   The drive to improve campus security is being spearheaded
by Constance B. and Howard K. Clery Jr., a Bryn Mawr, Pa.,
couple. In April 1986, their 19-year-old daughter Jeanne Ann
was murdered in her Lehigh University dormitory by another
student.
   Ms. Clery's killer had no difficulty entering her dorm
that morning. Three doors, with automatic locks, had been
propped open by students having a party. And Ms. Clery left
her room unlocked because her roommate forgot the key.
   In 1987, Josoph M. Henry was convicted of killing Ms.
Clery. But the Clerys say they were shocked to learn at the
trial about the level of crime at Lehigh and lapses in
security on the Bethlehem, Pa., campus.
   The Clerys filed a $25 million negligence suit against
Lehigh, which was settled for an undisclosed amount. They
used the money to set up Security On Campus Inc., a nonprofit
clearinghouse for information about campus crime. The
organization published a booklet listing questions parents
and prospective students should ask colleges about security.
The group also maintains a data base of appellate cases
involving lawsuits against universities.
   The Clerys have also lobbied state lawmakers to force
colleges to disclose information about campus crimes. Ten
states, including Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Delaware and
Louisiana, have enacted laws requiring universities and
colleges to publish three-year campus crime statistics.
Similar bills are pending in 30 other states.
   According to the Campus Violence Research Center at Towson
State University in Towson, Md., 639 sexual assaults, 2,598
physical assaults and six homicides occurred on 368 college
campuses in 1988, the latest year for which data are
available. The center says that 80% of all campus crime is
committed by students.
   But the group and other experts say the figures don't give
a complete picture of campus crime. Many schools report data
through local police agencies, but the campus statistics
aren't itemized in the final reports. And the experts contend
that universities frequently discourage students from
reporting crimes out of concern for bad publicity.
   While lawmakers say there has been no formal opposition to
the federal bill, concerns have been raised by educational
institutions that making crime information publicly available
may encourage suits. In recent years, courts in California,
New York, Florida and Massachusetts have held colleges and
universities liable for failing to protect students from
foreseeable criminal activity.
   Some lawyers feel that forcing universities to publish
crime statistics will make it easier to establish liability.
"In the past, when suing universities it has been difficult
to establish how many rapes and murders occurred on campus.
It will be far easier now to litigate the issue of
foreseeability," says Jeffrey A. Newman of the Boston firm
Newman, Durso &amp; Itzkowitz, which is handling 10 pending suits
against universities involving campus crime issues.
   In addition, there is some wariness about the possible
misuse of crime statistics. "We support the spirit of the
bill," says John Smeaton, assistant vice president for
student affairs at Lehigh. "But statistics alone do not tell
the whole story and are subject to misunderstanding."
   Some proponents of the federal bill have questioned
whether requiring colleges to report crime statistics will
help solve the problem. "The bill goes a long way to start
making people aware of crime on campuses. But it doesn't
speak in any way to the root causes of the crimes," says Jan
Mitchell Sherrill, director of the Campus Violence Prevention
Center. Mr. Sherrill said he would like to see colleges
implement crime prevention programs.
   Indeed, the recent Gainesville tragedy demonstrates the
limitations of the Florida law requiring statistics to be
reported. The state Legislature enacted a campus security
information bill in 1989. But under the law, the slayings
won't be included in crime statistic reports for the
University of Florida and Santa Fe Community College, where
the victims were students, because the killings occurred in
off-campus apartments. (The proposed federal law requires
educational institutions to report crimes committed against
students regardless of whether they occur on campus.)
   Nonetheless, the Clerys and others believe that publishing
the statistics will force universities to beef up campus
security. "It won't reduce the number of criminally inclined
individuals," says Frank Carrington, a Virginia Beach, Va.,
lawyer specializing in representing crime victims, including
the Clerys' organization. "But if students know they should
take care of themselves, if they are forewarned to walk in
pairs, then crime will decline."
   Lehigh's Mr. Smeaton says that since Ms. Clery's murder,
the school has increased its campus police force from 12 to
15 officers. Residence halls are locked 24 hours a day and
emergency telephones have been installed around campus, Mr.
Smeaton says.
   And as part of the settlement with the Clerys, alarms go
off in the campus police station if doors at Ms. Clery's
former dorm are left open for longer than 20 seconds. Mr.
Smeaton says the school plans to install similar systems in
all the dorms.

   France's Societe Generale said it plans to acquire 40% of
Spanish brokerage Interdealers, the latest step in the
consolidation and internationalization of Spain's financial
market.
   Societe Generale said it plans to buy the Interdealers
stake in two stages for an undisclosed sum from its current
shareholders -- six former stockbrokers, including the former
chairman of the Madrid stock exchange, Javier Ramos.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Immediately afterwards, both sides will subscribe to a
capital increase, raising the brokerage's capital and
reserves from one billion pesetas ($10.2 million) to 1.5
billion pesetas.
   Interdealers, set up in 1985, has 70 employees and a 1%-2%
share of the Spanish securities market. Like other Spanish
brokerages, it has suffered since the start of this year from
a market downturn.
   Earlier this year, it reported pretax profits for the
first half of 1990 of 17 million pesetas, compared with
pretax earnings of 290 million pesetas for all of 1989.
   In a joint statement, the two partners said the linkup
will strengthen Interdealers' activities in Spain and give it
access to Societe Generale's international financial network.
   Societe Generale is a leading player in international
futures and options markets, areas in which Spain is
expanding.

   As George Bush sits down in Helsinki with Mikhail
Gorbachev this Sunday, the world's focus will be on the two
large and difficult subjects on his agenda: Saddam Hussein's
threat to the Persian Gulf and the potential economic
collapse of the Soviet Union. But if you stand back from the
details, what you see is quite remarkable: The United States
in a position of unchallenged world leadership.
   It is clear to everyone that the U.S. President is going
into his meeting in Helsinki with the stronger hand. And for
once the two men have something serious to talk about.
Indeed, only 10 months after the Berlin Wall came down, it
appears that a healthy sense of reality about the world and
the ordering of its politics is setting in.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We are not suggesting here any sort of American
triumphalism in world affairs. The point is that what we are
witnessing now in America's leadership role in assembling a
force to stop Saddam Hussein and George Bush's largely
successful world-wide efforts to collect support for that
effort is a concrete recognition of the way the world
actually works. Since at least the end of the Vietnam War,
there has been a strain of thinking among intellectuals and
pundits which propounded the view that the U.S.'s prominent
role in the world's affairs was clumsy, overextended or
insensitive to "local" realities. Until recently, this view
found its most explicit outlet in the policy initiatives of
congressional Democrats and their orbit of advisory
satellites.
   The basic flaw in this world view (and one interestingly
now finding an echo among some conservatives) is the belief
that nations are essentially isolated, island-like actors,
responding mostly to internal interests and forces, which are
somehow unbalanced or thwarted by the "presence" of the
United States. But this is a perception of national
relationships that, at least in economic terms, has never
been true and in our time has been proven politically invalid
as well.
   Like it or not, the world's politics are now bound
together -- by trade, by money and by electronics. Our
friends on the right are suspicious of relationships with the
world's heterogeneous peoples. Both they and their
counterparts on the left seem bored with the dry details of
how an interconnected world actually succeeds or fails -- the
destructive disequilibrium in exchange rates, the need to
negotiate a more liberal system of international trade (a
"combat zone" in some views), and the necessity to let
immigrant labor move freely toward economic opportunities.
But these details determine whether people in the U.S. and
elsewhere have jobs, prosper and improve themselves.
   In a world of sovereign nations, none of these matters
simply resolve themselves. As always in history, they require
leadership. And again, like it or not, one nation is going to
do the leading. For the foreseeable future, that nation is
the United States.
   In his statement to the House Foreign Affairs Committee
this week, Secretary of State Baker stated well the Bush
administration's recognition of the post Cold War realities.
"Amidst the revolutions sweeping the globe and the
transformation of East-West relations, I think we stand at a
critical juncture in history," Mr. Baker said. "While the
rules of the road developed during the Cold War did in the
end preserve peace, the task now is to build an enduring
peace that is global in scope and not limited just to
Europe."
   Without question there could be serious missteps between
the enunciation and execution of this goal in the Persian
Gulf. Worries persist that Mr. Bush might settle for an Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait, leaving the pirate regime of Saddam
Hussein in place and dangerous. But the overwhelming logic of
the situation argues against such an outcome as does, we
might point out, the slow but inexorable build-up of U.S.
forces there.
   If there is a show-stopper in this undertaking it isn't
likely to be George Bush's will but instead a traditional
Soviet threat to draw a line in the sand around Baghdad. Most
probably, Mr. Bush will be in Helsinki seeking some signal of
the Soviet Union's intentions and desires on this crucial
matter.
   The Soviet military establishment's interests aside, it
seems clear that the peoples of the 15 Soviet republics are
now more intent on participating in the world's future
progress than in propping up the Saddam Husseins of the
world. In some nominal sense Mikhail Gorbachev is in Helsinki
as their leader, and in time we'll know whether he defines
leadership as representing their expressed interests.
   The paradox of Helsinki is that Soviet military might and
economic weakness have combined to make Mr. Gorbachev's
meeting with the American President a necessity. Mr. Bush
will be there to represent U.S. interests but just as clearly
he is representing all those who have an interest in
achieving a post Cold War order in which people are free to
produce, trade their goods and enjoy the fruits of those
labors. It is a simply stated goal, but it will not be
achieved in our time without American leadership.

   The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on
nationwide telephone interviews of 800 registered voters
conducted Tuesday and Wednesday by the polling organizations
of Peter Hart and Robert Teeter.
   The sample was drawn from 263 randomly selected geographic
points in the continental U.S. Each region of the country was
represented in proportion to its population. Households were
selected by a method that gave all telephone numbers, listed
and unlisted, an equal chance of being included. One
registered voter, 18 years or older, was selected from each
household by a procedure to provide the correct number of
male and female respondents. The results of the survey were
minimally weighted by race to ensure that the poll accurately
reflects registered voters nationwide.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chances are 19 of 20 that if all registered voters in the
U.S. had been surveyed using the same questionnaire, the
findings would differ from these poll results by no more than
3.5 percentage points in either direction. The margin of
error for subgroups would be larger.

   WORCESTER, Mass. -- Transgenic Sciences Inc. said it was
awarded two federal contracts totaling $3.4 million to
conduct carcinogenicity and toxicology testing.
   Transgenic Sciences said the contracts, from the National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, will contribute
to its revenues over the next three years.

<TEXT>
   For the year ended July 1, Transgenic posted a loss of $1
million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $6.9 million. For
1989, the company reported a loss of $1.2 million, or 40
cents a share, on revenue of $105,000.
   Separately, Transgenic Sciences received two agreements

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices barely budged as investors again
shrugged off rising oil prices and braced for today's
potentially market-moving employment report.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 1/8 point
higher, a gain of just $1.25 for bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, fell to 8.95% from 8.96% on
Wednesday. Short-term securities ended unchanged to slightly
lower.

   But trading was very light. "Everyone is waiting for the
employment report," said Philip Braverman, senior vice
president and chief economist at DKB Securities Corp.
   "There was barely any movement in price and barely any
activity on the trading floors," said Kevin Logan, chief
economist at Swiss Bank Corp. of America.
   The employment report has become one of the market's most
potent economic indicators, with the ability to dramatically
sway bond market sentiment and cause wild gyrations in bond
prices. Because of this potential, trading often slows ahead
of the report's release.
   Among other things, investors hope to find clues about the
future direction of interest rates and Federal Reserve
monetary policy. There is widespread speculation that if the
report shows clear signs of economic weakness -- rising
unemployment or slow jobs growth -- the Federal Reserve may
reduce short-term interest rates in an effort to stave off an
economic recession.
   But if the jobs report is ambiguous, the future direction
of interest rates remains uncertain.
   A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report consensus of economists
expects nonfarm payrolls rose 83,000 in August, excluding the
layoff of census workers, in marked contrast to the growth in
payrolls early this year and in 1989.
   With the possibility of the Fed easing dominating market
talk, other events had little impact. The market largely
brushed aside a rise in oil prices. October oil futures ended
the day at $31.43 a barrel, up $1.66 at the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments also failed to
inspire trading interest. In a written response to questions
from the House Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said that if
credit conditions tightened further, the central bank "might
find it appropriate to adjust policy."
   Meanwhile, the World Bank plans to sell its third global
bond issue in the next few weeks, with an offering that will
total between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.
   As with the prior issues, the new securities are designed
to trade globally 24 hours a day and will be underwritten and
distributed simultaneously in Europe, the U.S. and Japan.
   A group of 15 investment dealers will bring the issue to
market, with West Germany's Deutsche Bank Capital Markets
Group and the U.S.'s Salomon Brothers Inc. serving as joint
lead managers.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
97 27/32, up from 97 22/32 on Wednesday while the yield eased
to 8.95% from 8.96%. The latest two-year notes ended at 100
4/32, down slightly from 100 5/32 on Wednesday while the
yield rose to 8.04% from 8.02%.
   Short-term rates were little changed. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.39% for a bond
equivalent yield of 7.61% while the rate on six-month bills
ended at 7.33% to yield 7.70%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Resolution Trust Corp.'s liquidation of nearly $30
million in junk bonds did little to rattle the high-yield
market.
   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended unchanged
to about 1/4 point lower.
   A spokesman for the RTC, the government agency set up to
bail out the nation's troubled thrifts, confirmed that the
agency was in the market selling about $30 million in
high-yield high-risk securities.
   Although the spokesman declined to specify which bonds the
RTC liquidated, market participants said they were
high-quality, liquid issues. "They were all names the market
wanted to buy, and were absorbed easily by the market," said
one high-yield trader.
   Among the names on the RTC's bid list were junk bonds of
Duracell Holdings Corp., Coltec Industries and Playtex Family
Products, market sources said.
   Elsewhere, in the high-yield market, junk bonds of
Burlington Holdings Inc. continued to weaken on concerns that
the textile maker will be financially squeezed if a recession
materializes.
   Burlington's 14.25% subordinated debentures, due in 1999,
were quoted at 67, down two points, while the company's
13.875% subordinated debentures, due in 1996, were quoted at
72, down two points.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended unchanged to 1/8 point higher in
very quiet trading.
   The market for new issues was moderately busy, with more
than $402 million of new debt priced.
   The most talked about issue yesterday was an $84 million
offering by the New York City Industrial Development Agency
on behalf of American Airlines Inc. via a group led by Bear
Stearns &amp; Co. The 29-year and 30-year bonds were priced to
yield 8.06% and 8.07%, respectively. American Airlines is a
unit of AMR Corp.
   Analysts said yields for the bonds were relatively high
for an issue that is largely tax-exempt, a reflection of the
market's trepidations about the long-term prospects of the
airline industry. Still, the attractive yields lured large
numbers of both institutional and individual investors and
allowed underwriters to reprice the bonds and lower the
yields from initial levels of 8.12% and 8.13%.
   Although the bonds are subject to alternative minimum tax,
a manager at Bear Stearns said the bonds are
triple-tax-exempt for residents of New York state. For
investors whose income from the bonds would be fully tax
exempt, the yields on the American Airline bonds would
translate into a taxable equivalent yield of over 11%.
   "The good news is that the yield is very attractive," said
Bruce Whiteford, manager of fixed-income trading at Chase
Manhattan U.S. Private Banking. "But given the long maturity,
uncertainty of where interest rates are going and concerns
about the airline industry, these could be very volatile
bonds," he said.
   Mr. Whiteford estimates that if interest rates rise
one-half percentage point, the price of these bonds would
fall about five points, or about $50 for each $1,000 face
amount.
   The proceeds from the bond sale will be used to refurbish
and rebuild certain areas at New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy
airports.
   Among benchmark issues yesterday, New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% bond due 2018 were unchanged at 98 1/2 to
yield 7.31%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities showed slight gains in late trading.
   Government National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue
for September delivery was quoted at 98 23/32, up 4/32.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2% issue and Federal
National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue for September
delivery both were up 3/32, at 98 8/32 and 98 26/32,
respectively.
   The primary market experienced a slight upswing in real
estate mortgage investment conduit, or Remic, issuance.
   Citibank N.A., a Citicorp unit, announced a $350 million
Fannie Mae 90-121 issue, backed by Fannie Mae's 9 1/2%
securities. Nomura Securities announced a $300 million Fannie
Mae 90-122 issue, also backed by Fannie Mae's 9 1/2% issue.
   First Boston Corp. announced First Boston Mortgage
Securities Corp. 1990-1, a $137 million Remic collateralized
by whole loans.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The Japanese bond market, already reeling from a renewed
rise in oil prices and higher short-term interest rates,
deteriorated further yesterday on news that a U.S. citizen
was shot in the Middle East.
   The yield on the benchmark No. 119 10year bond rose to
nearly 8.3%, but eased late in the day to end at 8.24%. The
price of the benchmark issue closed at 82.50, down 0.37
points. (When calculated using the semi-annual compound
method to compare yields across markets, the yield on the No.
119 bond ended at 7.56%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   The State Department said an American citizen was shot and
wounded in Kuwait City by Iraqi police while trying to evade
capture at his apartment. News of the shooting weakened the
Japanese stock market and lifted the dollar.
   Major European bond markets ended higher in light trading.

   SYDNEY, Australia -- Qantas Airways might court major
foreign carriers as shareholders, Chairman Bill Dix said. The
Australian government, which owns Qantas, is considering the
sale of at least part of the international airline.
   "In the context of consolidation in world aviation, I
wouldn't be at all surprised to see Qantas taking additional
equity stakes in smaller carriers, like those we already hold
in Air New Zealand and Air Pacific," Mr. Dix said at a
tourism seminar. "Furthermore, I wouldn't rule out the
acquisition of a stake in Qantas by some of the major
carriers with which we do and will be doing business. Japan
Air Lines, {AMR Corp.'s} American, British Airways and
Lufthansa {German Airlines} come to mind as carriers we'll be
working with closely."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Australian government's cabinet yesterday decided to
sell stakes in Qantas and Australian Airlines, one of two
major domestic airlines. The cabinet also decided in
principle to expose the government-owned monopoly telephone
company to competition.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke didn't say how much of the
airlines' share capital the government might sell. Analysts
speculated that stakes of at least 49% might be put on the
market. The Labor Party still must approve the sales.
   Mr. Dix said that "without access to the necessary capital
funds, both debt and equity, Qantas will be unable to
maintain the growth needed to service Australia's expanding
tourism industry."

   Moscow's Thin Profile at Fair
   Suggests Weakening Ties
   With East German Trade

   LEIPZIG, East Germany -- From the outside, it looks like
business as usual at the huge Soviet pavilion at the Leipzig
Trade Fair. A towering bust of Lenin glares from its pedestal
at the main entrance; above, a gold spire topped with a red
star reaches into the gray September sky.
   Inside, however, it's clear that something is terribly
wrong.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet pavilion this year seems strangely empty --
even by East bloc standards. At last year's autumn fair, 300
companies were represented here; only 35 made it this time
around. The displays include color televisions from Lvov,
refrigerators from Minsk, and washing machines from a
converted missile factory in Votkinsk. But only a trickle of
onlookers wander through the building, and most of the
pavilion is closed off and dark.
   Part of the reason for the declining Soviet profile is
practical: The Soviets can no longer afford to come to
Leipzig in full force, since hotels and other costs are now
calculated in German marks. The problem reaches deeper,
however.
   Until last year's democratic upheaval in Eastern Europe,
Moscow used Leipzig's East-West trade fair as a place to
parade the best and brightest of Soviet industry, a practice
that once included erecting an elaborate display of a
Sputnik. Never mind that little of what was on show was
actually for sale; this was Cold War politics of the highest
order.
   Now, with the two Germanys hurtling toward full
unification in less than a month, the rules of the game
suddenly have shifted. While politicians from both sides of
the German border talk extensively about the need to maintain
East Germany's historic trade links with the Soviets, the
evidence in Leipzig seems to suggest that the connection
already is wearing thin.
   "We're certainly not happy with the situation at this
fair," complains Wolfram Kapzow, a Soviet trade
representative who has attended 20 Leipzig fairs since 1965.
   Mr. Kapzow's office, tucked in one corner of the Soviet
pavilion, is one of the few places that still seems fully
occupied. A steady stream of stern-faced German businessmen
shuffle through the Soviet official's outer office as he
works on renegotiating more than 200 bilateral trade
contracts with the East Germans. The contracts are set to
expire at the end of this year; after that, all calculations
will be in German marks. Later this week, officials from the
Soviet Union will meet here with representatives from both
Germanys to discuss the problem.
   As for the fair itself, the Soviets seem reconciled to
drastic change. They even have encouraged some of the decline
in Soviet participation by restricting displays to companies
that have products ready to be sold abroad.
   Out on the display floor the Soviets are trying to make
the best of the situation. Sergey Mashinnikov, a spokesman
for Votkinsky Zavod, a factory that once produced SS-20
missiles, is showing off his latest line of consumer products
-- a baby buggy made from bright pink fake leather and a
plastic washing machine that a company pamphlet describes as
a "true enchantress."
   "As you can see, we're doing our best to produce new
products to meet our new situation," says Mr. Mashinnikov.
"But making the transition isn't easy."
   Down the aisle from Mr. Mashinnikov's baby buggies, a tank
factory from Ishewsk displays a candy-apple red Ish-Planeta-5
motorcycle. Like the missile factory, the tank-cum-motorcycle
maker already was making consumer goods, but only as a side
line.
   The problems facing the Soviets could mean this is the
last time such offerings can all be viewed under one roof.
Soviet officials say they intend to keep the pavilion -- a
1950s-era concoction that looks like a giant wedding cake --
but they're not quite sure what they'll do with it.
   "It's our property, but we may decide to turn it into a
hall where we can rent space to others," says Mr. Kapzow, the
trade representative. Beginning next spring, the Soviets plan
to spread their concerns out into the buildings devoted to
particular industries, as most other countries long have
done. The pavilion then could be renovated or even demolished
and rebuilt from scratch.
   "Until now, this was all political, of course," says Mr.
Kapzow. "We had our building with a red star up above and a
bust of Lenin out front, but now we've got to learn to
operate on a commercial basis."

   Market Declines on Surging Oil Prices
   And News That U.S. Hostage Was Shot

   NEW YORK -- The over-the-counter market sank further as
oil prices surged back above $30 a barrel.
   Traders say OTC share prices started out weak following
reports that an American hostage in Kuwait had been shot by
Iraqi forces and continued lower amid oil's implacable rise.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October futures
contract for a barrel of light sweet crude oil gained $1.66
to close at $31.43.
   "Oil is dictating which way this market goes," says Lance
Zipper, manager of OTC trading at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index ended with a 3.66 point loss,
down 0.96% to 378.78. The New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index slipped more than 1%.
   The rise in oil prices has revived some of the OTC
market's energy stocks.
   U.S. Energy rose 1 1/8 to 10 3/8 and Hamilton Oil added 1
7/8 to 42 3/8.
   But rising stocks were hard to find yesterday. OTC
advancers trailed decliners, 719 to 1,060. Volume rose to
98.7 million shares from Wednesday's 89 million shares.
   Jim Bellini, director of equity trading at Dain Bosworth,
says that the selling pressure remains light, as most
investors are sitting tight with their current stock
positions.
   But some of the big securities firms are now unabashedly
calling this a bear market, and are cautioning clients that
stock prices may slide beyond their lows hit at the end of
August.
   Robert Salomon Jr., managing director at Salomon Brothers
Inc., says that stock prices are still too high given the
outlook for corporate profits.
   "We anticipate a decline of 7% in S&amp;P 500 earnings in
1991," Mr. Salomon says, with the worst of that decline
coming early in 1991 following the onset of a recession in
the fourth quarter of this year.
   While he believes profits should snap back later in 1991,
"the earnings rebound is too far away and too tenuous to
support stock prices today," he says.
   Mr. Salomon says he is looking for the S&amp;P 500 Index to
fall to around the 260 level, while the Dow Jones Industrial
Average could drop as low as 2,100.
   The S&amp;P 500 Index fell 3.93 yesterday to 320.46, while the
the industrial average fell 31.93 to 2,596.29.
   While Salomon Brothers doesn't have a specific outlook for
the over-the-counter market, the firm is advising its clients
to stay in the more liquid stocks.
   JLG Industries managed to attract buyers following a
strong earnings statement. The stock rose 1 3/4 to 14 after
JLG reported fiscal fourth quarter profit of 77 cents a
share, up from 58 cents a share last year.
   Mack Trucks added 3/8 to 6 1/8 after France's Renault
raised its tender offer price for Mack Trucks' shares to
$6.25 each from its earlier offer of $6 a share.

   TOKYO -- Japan's Kawasaki Heavy Industries Co. will
produce part of the A-321 passenger jet being developed by
European airplane manufacturing consortium Airbus Industrie,
a Kawasaki official said.
   An official contract will be signed in mid-October between
Kawasaki and British Aerospace PLC, one of Airbus Industrie's
parent companies which makes bodies for Airbus airplanes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The A-321 jet, a long-bodied passenger jet still under
development, is scheduled for test flight in the spring of
1993 and marketing in the spring of 1994. There are more than
100 orders for the new jet so far, according to the official.
   The new plane, with a capacity of 180 passengers, will be
made by extending the body of the company's A-320 jet on both
ends by a total of 7 meters.
   Kawasaki will be the sole producer of skin panels to be
attached to the A-320's tail end.
   Details of the agreement are under negotiation, the
official said.
   The latest agreement is part of Kawasaki's business
strategy aimed at increasing sales in its private sector
division to reduce the company's dependency on the
Self-Defense Agency of Japan.
   Demand by the agency is expected to decline in coming
years due to a world-wide trend toward disarmament. Orders
for Kawasaki's P3C anti-submarine patrol planes, for example,
are likely to fall more than 30% in the next fiscal year, the
official said.

   Trade Fair in Leipzig Is Losing Luster

   Unification Dims City's Role
   As Trade Link to West

   LEIPZIG, East Germany -- Like East Germany itself, the
Leipzig Trade Fair faces an identity crisis.
   Until the Berlin Wall collapsed, the biannual event was by
far the most important meeting place for business between
East and West -- and a convenient stage for East Germany to
flex its economic muscle before the eyes of the world. But
now, with East Germany a month away from a full merger with
capitalist West Germany and its own economy in shambles, the
fair is losing its special status.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the Communists, foreign trade was jealously
controlled by central planners, so having a booth in Leipzig
was considered one of the few chances a Western company might
have to make contact with potential partners. "You had to be
in Leipzig if you wanted to get your foot in the door," says
Johannes von Thadden, an economist with the West German
Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Now, he says, "Leipzig
will be just another big fair in a united Germany, and it
will have to compete to survive."
   East German companies will have to follow the same advice.
This fall's trade fair is taking place against a background
of deepening economic turmoil in this once staunchly
communist country, and some wonder whether the East Germany's
flabby firms will survive. Many East bloc companies which
once proudly displayed their products here as evidence of
"socialist efficiency" are now using the fair like a giant
fire sale -- perhaps their last chance to find Western
partners who can help them make the difficult transition to
the market economy. "We talked about our own success for so
long, we started to believe in it," says a spokesman for one
East German chemical company, who asked not to be named.
   Still, Leipzig is still Leipzig, and the Germans no doubt
will get some good news out of it. The trade fair is
traditionally a time when firms announce new ventures.
   Right on schedule, Daimler-Benz AG let the news leak out
that it intends to pour one billion German marks ($634
million) into a truck plant in the East German town of
Ludwigsfelde. The plant is expected to start producing 6,000
medium-weight trucks by next year, with an annual production
target of 40,000 trucks by the middle of the decade.
   And the fair is fully booked, as usual, with 6,000 firms
represented from 54 countries -- including North Korea and
Cuba. But the number of East German companies present has
plunged from 1,800 to 1,000 this year, while Western firms
booked twice as much space as in 1989. Ironically, last
year's fall fair didn't allow the usual number of Western
firms because Communist authorities worried that bad
publicity might arise from the protest movement that was
centered in Leipzig.
   Many German politicians are hoping this fall's trade fair
will mark the economic turning point they've long awaited.
Last week, the two Germanys signed a treaty clearing the last
hurdles to unification on Oct. 3. The document covers many
issues crucial to business, including how East Germany will
handle land claims from former owners.
   The treaty was the favorite topic for politicians from
both Germanys who descended on Leipzig earlier this week to
open the week-long fair. West German Economics Minister
Helmut Haussmann dubbed the treaty a "major breakthrough" for
investors, adding that he was hoping to see indications of
this in Leipzig. East German Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere went so far as to say Leipzig was now ripe to become
an "investment fair."
   But despite such high hopes, Mr. de Maiziere got precious
little encouragement during a morning stroll through the
fair's sprawling grounds. Representatives from Japan's Juki
Corp., a leading producer of sewing machines, greeted the
East German warmly. But when asked by Mr. de Maiziere whether
the Japanese firm planned any investments in East Germany,
company officials gave a polite but clear, "No."
   While the likes of Daimler-Benz may be forging ahead with
investments in East Germany, the question in Leipzig is
whether smaller West German firms are ready to follow suit.
"In the long run," says Mr. von Thadden, the West German
economist, "getting the smaller firms is more important,
because it shows that there are good business opportunities
even for those without special muscle."
   Against this background, many German officials say Leipzig
will continue to play an important -- though not a
monopolisticrole in East-West trade. Mr. Haussmann, speaking
after a quick visit to the fair, said it would be wrong to
suddenly detach East Germany from its traditional trading
partners in the East. He admitted, however, that Leipzig
needs to work on its "concept" as a trade fair center inside
a new Germany.
   Indeed, East German organizers have already launched a
frenzied effort to strengthen the Leipzig tradition. They are
setting up a series of specialized fairs, focusing on
industries such as construction and tourism, to run parallel
to the more famous spring and fall events.
   Even if the effort fails, it will be a long time before
the legacy of Leipzig is forgotten. With a history as a trade
center dating back eight centuries, many Leipzigers consider
big trade fairs part of their identity. Elmar Pieroth, a
leading member of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democrats, remembers coming to Leipzig in 1988,
when he was an honored guest of East German party boss Erich
Honecker at a reception in the town's government guest house.
This year, Mr. Pieroth hosted an informal lunch in the same
setting. "It looks like Leipzig, but it feels totally
different," he said.
   Of course, many would like to forget some of the details
of Leipzig's past. Under the Communists, Leipzig's spring
fair sported such oddities as hundreds of Erich Honecker
posters and a booth devoted to the Palestine Liberation
Organization. A spokeswoman for the fair says she's not sure
whether the PLO will come next spring, since the deadline for
applications has not yet passed. "Of course," she says,
"everyone is welcome in Leipzig who wants to come."

   Penny-Stock Firms,
   Aides Are Charged
   With Fraud by SEC

   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
charged two penny-stock brokerage firms -- one in Las Vegas
and one in Colorado -- and 18 individuals with running
schemes that allegedly netted illegal gains of more than $20
million.
   The case is one of the biggest ever against a penny-stock
firm and roughly equals the size of the case against Blinder,
Robinson &amp; Co., the Denver penny-stock brokerage giant that
the SEC has been battling for years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So far, all of the defendants appear to be fighting the
SEC charges, which also include allegations of insider
trading. The agency's civil suit, filed in federal district
court in Denver, seeks repayment of all profits plus $3
million of civil penalties for the insider-trading charges.
   The agency said the firms, Power Securities Corp., Las
Vegas, and Allied Capital Group Inc., Englewood, Colo., along
with executives and promoters of the firms, misled investors
into buying penny stocks through fraudulent sales pitches and
used "high pressured, coercive sales practices." The firms,
which the SEC said had a "secret working relationship,"
netted $9.4 million through excessive markups in six
securities, according to the commission.
   The SEC also said the firms manipulated the market for the
securities of Star Publications Inc. and Art Cards Inc., two
other companies with penny stocks. Power and Allied
"secretly" limited the supply of securities, artificially
controlling the supply, demand and price of Star Publications
stock, the agency said. In the case of Art Cards, the
brokerage houses disseminated false information to
prospective investors, the SEC said. These two "schemes"
resulted in illegal profits of more than $10 million, the SEC
said.
   Some of the claims made by the brokerage firms were
blatantly false, the SEC said. For example, Power gave
brokers scripts to read to clients that touted pop artist
Peter Max and Yoko Ono, wife of the late Beatle John Lennon,
as spokesmen for Art Cards. Power salesmen claimed that the
two had appeared on Music Television, the Larry King "Live"
Show on Cable News Network and elsewhere to promote Art
Cards, the SEC said. But neither Mr. Max nor Ms. Ono worked
for the company, the agency said.
   The SEC also said that Power scripts stated that Star had
55 million shares outstanding and only 20 million trading;
but the company actually had 170 million to 500 million
shares outstanding at the time the statements were made, the
commission contended. In addition, Power brokers stated that
Star's razor product was biodegradable when in fact the razor
was made of plastic that wouldn't decompose and wasn't
biodegradable, the SEC said.
   The agency also charged the two brokerage houses with
insider trading in Star securities before the company was
acquired by closely held Inner Vision Inc. The SEC is seeking
repayment of $1 million in allegedly illegal profits, plus $3
million in insider-trading fines.
   In addition to the firms, the SEC charged Power's chief
executive officer, Richard T. Marchese; Power's former
president Orville L. Sandberg; Allied President Peter
Mercaldi; Allied's former president, Barry H. Freedman; and
several other executives of the two firms.
   A person at Allied Capital said that Mr. Mercaldi and
other officials qualified to comment were out of town. Power
Securities and the other officials named in the suit couldn't
be reached for comment.

   Consumer Agency
   Seeks Big Rate Cut
   At Unit of Nynex

   The New York Consumer Protection Board is asking state
regulators to cut the rates of Nynex Corp.'s New York
Telephone unit by $395 million and to extend the
investigation into phone company overpayments on purchases
made through other Nynex companies.
   At the same time, the New York attorney general is urging
the Public Service Commission to reject the company's request
for a rate increase of about $825 million that would go into
effect in January 1991. Attorney General Robert Abrams also
wants New York Telephone penalized for "poor service and
inadequate maintenance" and urged the PSC to cut current
rates by at least $9.8 million, reflecting improper charges
to customers for charitable contributions. New York
Telephone's actual rate increase request has been estimated
at as much as $1.4 billion over the next three years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The recommendations from the consumer agency and the
attorney general were made in briefs filed as part of a rate
case that began earlier this year. A New York Telephone
spokesman called the Consumer Protection Board recommendation
"out of touch with reality."
   Since New York Telephone agreed to a rate moratorium four
years ago, rates have declined $467 million, the spokesman
said. Given the worsening economic conditions in the state
and increasing needs for improvements in the phone network, a
rate cut could hurt consumers and the company, he said. New
York Telephone will submit a brief today defending its rate
request.
   Richard Kessel, executive director of the consumer agency,
urged a rate reduction of $231 million and a refund for New
York Telephone customers of $164 million. The PSC staff
earlier had recommended an $81 million rate cut.
   The Consumer Protection Board also is seeking a management
audit by outside auditors and a self-assessment program for
New York Telephone's management as a way to "meet the
obligations of a regulated company to hold down the cost of
its monopoly services and the obligation of a competitive
firm to compete fairly in the marketplace."
   Mr. Kessel also asked the commission to investigate New
York Telephone's construction program, saying that testimony
during recent hearings on the rate increase request "showed
that many New York Telephone construction projects are
unnecessary, overdesigned or unduly risky."
   He further called for an extension of the investigation
into transactions involving the phone company and other Nynex
units, particularly Materiel Enterprises Co. The purchasing
unit was cited earlier this year by federal regulators for
overcharging Nynex's two phone companies for goods and
services it had provided. More recently, the rate case
brought to light a series of bawdy annual parties arranged by
a Materiel Enterprises executive, who was fired two years ago
for organizing the gatherings. The parties, nicknamed pervert
conventions, included several Materiel Enterprises managers,
employees of about 30 Nynex suppliers and prostitutes.

   A year after Paramount Communications Inc.'s failed bid
for Time Inc., the big question still looms: What is Martin
S. Davis going to do for an encore?
   Paramount has spent the last year in talks with a number
of possible acquisition or merger candidates. And Mr. Davis,
chairman and chief executive officer of Paramount, says
discussions with a number of prospects continue. "Maybe
someone's going to buy us," he suggests. But so far, no deal
has materialized, in part because prices of media and
entertainment properties remain unrealistically high, Mr.
Davis says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After spending the last several years whittling Paramount
from a lumbering conglomerate to a streamlined entertainment
and publishing company, "we are designed to merge or acquire,
we're not designed to stay as is," says the 63-year-old Mr.
Davis. Among the businesses he has looked at are recorded
music, cable television, theme parks, newspaper publishing
and programming. But finding the right match, he adds,
"requires patience and a long-term investment view."
   Mr. Davis, who spent nearly $40 million on a $200-a-share
bid for Time, can take some consolation from the fact that
Time's defensive merger with Warner Communications Inc.
saddled the combined company with heavy debt that Paramount
doesn't have to worry about. And Time Warner stock, at nearly
$125 a share at the time of the merger, has plunged as low as
$72.50 a share recently, closing yesterday at $79.875, down
$1.125.
   But Mr. Davis has his own stock price to worry about. Once
a Wall Street favorite, Paramount has been trading near its
52-week low recently, and some once-bullish analysts have
turned sour, concerned by mounting costs in its movie
business and industrywide problems in publishing. Yesterday,
Paramount stock closed at $34.875, down 62.5 cents, on news
that the company expected earnings for fiscal 1990 to be "on
target," but "at the lower range" of earlier estimates of
$2.10 to $2.60 a share.
   For the fiscal third quarter, net income and earnings from
continuing operations rose to $106.2 million, or 88 cents a
share, a 10.2% increase from net income in the third quarter
last year of $96.3 million, or 80 cents a share, and a nearly
sixfold increase over earnings from continuing operations of
$18.5 million, or 15 cents a share.
   In the fiscal 1989 period, net income included $77.8
million, or 65 cents a share, from discontinued operations,
primarily the $3.35 billion sale of The Associates financial
services unit last year to Ford Motor Co. Third quarter
revenue rose to $1.04 billion from $950.6 million.
   Results from continuing operations in the third quarter
included net interest income of $10.6 million, primarily from
the investment of proceeds from the sale of Associates. Net
income in the comparable fiscal 1989 period included $32.1
million of net interest expense and the $48.3 million charge
for the Time bid.
   A number of analysts still regard Paramount as one of the
strongest long-term players in the entertainment and media
business, where the stocks of virtually all the big players
have taken a beating recently. But many analysts expected
Paramount to move more aggressively to expand with cash from
the Associates sale.
   That war chest is down to about $1.6 billion now; the rest
has gone to pay taxes, reduce debt, repurchase stock,
contribute to a $200 million Madison Square Garden
renovation, and make small acquisitions. For example,
Paramount paid about $119 million for 83% of television
station concern TVX Broadcast Group and about $75 million for
Computer Curriculum Corp.
   But some analysts remain leery. "It concerns me that a lot
of the cash raised with sale of Associates went out the door
without pulling off the big acquisition that would really
strengthen the company," says Alan Kassan, an analyst at
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. "They made some small and medium
strategic acquisitions but they haven't added any major new
profit centers. The third leg of the stool is not there yet."
   It isn't for lack of trying. Paramount looked at Six Flags
Amusement Co. before Time Warner acquired a stake in it, and
negotiated with Geffen Records Co. prior to its acquisition
by MCA Inc. In both cases, Paramount backed away.
   Similarly, record industry executives say Paramount was in
discussions with Bertelsmann AG regarding the purchase of a
50% interest in its recorded music group, which includes RCA
Records. Bertelsmann was said to be seeking close to $900
million for the interest. Bertelsmann executives have
declined to comment.
   Mr. Davis declines to discuss specific companies. But he
acknowledges, "we have looked at specific opportunities to
invest in the theme park and recorded music businesses, but
we ultimately concluded that the opportunities presented
could not achieve an acceptable return on our investment
given the acquisition prices and growth potential of the
companies." He says he remains interested in both businesses
and will continue to explore opportunities.
   Paramount has also had discussions with cable giant
Tele-Communications Inc., and has reportedly been looking at
Gannett Co. since the Gannett Foundation announced plans
recently to sell its 10% stake. Wall Street analysts
speculate that Paramount might one day merge Viacom Inc. or
MCA. Another candidate: Capital Cities/ABC Inc., should
federal rules restricting ownership of both a studio and a TV
network be lifted.
   Mr. Davis bristles at analyst's criticisms that he hasn't
moved quickly enough, snapping, "we're not going to march to
the interests of short-term traders." Moreover, he says,
"having cash is nothing to be ashamed of," and the company's
balance sheet "is the strongest of any media and
entertainment company around."
   Some analysts agree. In a recent purchase recommendation,
research firm MacDonald Grippo Reily Inc. said "there may be
no sizzle in this story at the moment, but (Paramount) has
very solid asset values, has management which historically
has been adept at refining the mix of businesses, and will
generate cash at an accelerating rate." While publishing
operating profit rose 11% to $103.9 million in the third
quarter, Paramount's entertainment unit reported a 4% decline
in operating profit, to $55.1 million. Television operations
are strong, and Paramount Pictures has the summer's biggest
hit, "Ghost." But three other releases this summer were
disappointments. Paramount said yesterday that "Days of
Thunder" and "The Two Jakes" didn't contribute to earnings.
"Another 48 Hours" did make money, though not anywhere near
as much as expected.
   "Paramount has been caught up more than some other studios
in the cost spiral," says Mr. Kassan of Morgan Stanley. Mr.
Davis acknowledges costs are a problem. "We can't place the
blame on agents and talent," he says. "Obviously they are
going to ask for as much as they can get. Unfortunately, this
is an industrywide problem based on frenzied competition,
which has bid up costs beyond realistic levels. Everyone is
guilty of it."
   But Mr. Davis vows that the inflation will halt. "We at
Paramount aren't going to continue on that route and we are
taking the steps we believe are necessary for containment,
while still producing commercially successful, quality motion
pictures," he says. Paramount Chairman Frank Mancuso has
recently made some management changes at the studio, and more
are expected.
   Despite the slings and arrows of analysts, some big
investors, at least, remain bullish. Investor Mario Gabelli,
a longtime investor, recently lifted his stake to 5.08%,
saying he likes the long-term prospects. And Mr. Davis says
enhancing values remains his priority -- even if it means
selling the company and stepping aside himself. "My interest
is solely in creating the best value for the shareholders, no
matter where it takes me," he says. "I've never deviated from
that position."

   Ratners Group PLC waived a provision of its agreement to
acquire Kay Jewelers Inc., removing a technical hurdle to the
stock-swap deal.
   Ratners said it will no longer condition the acquisition
on the company's receiving a majority of both classes of
Kay's $150 million in junk bonds. Ratners has acquired more
than 90% of one class of bonds but only a small fraction of
the other class.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ratners said it expects to complete its acquisition of Kay
shortly after Kay's stockholders approve the deal in October.
   Kay, a retail jewelry chain based in Alexandria, Va., has
about 12.4 million shares outstanding. Under the agreement,
each Kay share will be swapped for a convertible preferred
share of Ratners. Ratners values the new stock at $17 a
share, although some analysts put the stock's value at $14 to
$15 a share.

   NEW YORK -- The world's industrial economies continue to
show signs of slow growth.
   The Conference Board said its International Economic
Scoreboard shows the composite indexes of leading indicators
for 11 of the world's major industrial economies growing at
an annual rate of 2%, the same figure reported three months
ago. Since this figure predates the crisis in the Middle
East, the report suggests even slower growth ahead.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The recent curtailment of oil supplies and rise in the
cost of oil will likely add a depressing influence to the
slow growth prospects already shown by the leading indexes
for most countries," the report said.
   The report looks at leading indicators because these
measures are generally thought to signal future economic
trends.
   Europe is showing the greatest signs of strength,
especially West Germany, where the leading index is growing
at an annual rate of 4%. France is not far behind, with the
leading index rising at 3%. Italy's rate is 1%. The U.K.
index has fallen 1%.
   Japan continues to lead the Pacific region, with its index
growing at 3%, followed by New Zealand at 1%. Indexes in
Korea and Taiwan both dropped by 1%, while Australia's fell
3%.
   In North America, Canada's leading index is now falling at
a rate of 3%, while in the U.S. the leading index is growing
at 1%.
   The indexes are compiled monthly by the Center for
International Business Cycle Research at the Columbia
University Business School. The Conference Board is an
independent business research group.

   Pic 'N' Save Corp. posted a fiscal second-quarter loss of

one-time pretax charges related to its recent proxy contest
and restructuring.
   In the quarter ended July 2, 1989, the Dominguez, Calif.,

   Sales rose 11%, to $112.7 million from $101.8 million.
   Operating earnings, excluding the onetime charges, fell to
$6.6 million from $12.1 million. Pic 'N' Save blamed the drop
on shrinkage in its gross profit rate, higher store expenses
as a percentage of sales and higher interest expenses.
   Pic 'N' Save, a retail chain that specializes in close-out
merchandise, recently cut short a threatened proxy fight with
Girard Partners Limited Partnership and investor David

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Canada's Belzberg family
sold at a loss its 5.16% stake in Britain's Asda Group PLC on
the London Stock Exchange.
   Terms of the sale weren't disclosed, and officials with
Belzberg flagship First City Financial Corp., the
Vancouver-based holding and investment concern through which
the family acquired the Asda stake, weren't available for
comment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the paper loss -- excluding carrying and related
charges, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates -- is
believed to be around US$45 million, based on an analyst's
estimate previously confirmed by First City.
   The loss marks the latest in a string of investments that
turned sour for First City, including its 11.7% stake in
Armstrong World Industries Inc., which the company sold May
31 at a net estimated loss of $13.6 million.
   Last week, First City reported a first-half loss of 27.7
million Canadian dollars (US$24 million), or 53 Canadian
cents a share, on revenue of C$436 million, compared with
prior-year net before extraordinary items of C$58.9 million,
or C$1.07 a share, on revenue of C$456 million. A special
gain made net last year C$182.6 million, or C$3.32 a share.
   First City said that the stake in Asda, a big retailer,
wasn't an "appropriate long-term investment" and it would
like to emphasize its financial services, manufacturing and
real estate operating companies.
   First City sold the bulk of its holdings to a group of
institutions, according to brokers in London. At last report,
First City held about 65 million Asda shares.
   In London Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Asda's shares
closed at 109 pence (US$2.07) each, down 3.5 pence. First
City acquired its Asda shares at an average price of about
#1.50, according to a report by Toronto's First Marathon
Securities Ltd. that was later confirmed by a First City
executive.
   Tony McNeary, an analyst with London's County NatWest
Securities, predicted that with the Belzbergs gone, Asda's
share price "will remain there (at 109 pence) for a while and
probably won't motor back up."

   Mack Trucks Clears
   $81 Million Buy-Out

   ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Financially troubled Mack Trucks
Inc. said it approved an $81 million buy-out by Renault
Vehicules Industriels S.A.
   Mack said the agreement, which calls for the Paris-based
Renault to pay $6.25 a share, was reached earlier in the
week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Renault started the week with 44.5% of Mack's 29 million
shares. On Wednesday, the French firm purchased 4.5% more.
   The French firm hopes to buy the rest of the stock by
Sept. 20, said a Renault spokesman.
   Renault has been trying to buy out Allentown-based Mack
for several months, saying it was making the offer "because
of the continuing deterioration of the financial condition of
Mack" and the need to restructure the company's debt.
   Mack had a record loss of $185.4 million last year and a
loss of $97.2 million in the six months ending June 30. Net
sales for the first half of 1990 were $793.9 million, a 22%
decrease from $1 billion a year earlier.
   The company's five-year financial plan in July projected a
net loss of about $130 million for this year. At the time,
Mack officials said they did not expect the company to show a
profit before 1992.
   In the past year, Mack has tried to reduce business costs
and conserve cash amid a slowing market for heavy trucks.
   Mack's financial adviser, BT Securities Corp., called the
$6.25-a-share offer fair.
   A Mack spokesman said the merger would have no immediate
effect on the firm's employees. "This just reflects a
corporate change," he said.
   The Renault spokesman said it was too early to predict any
changes. "This is still in the preliminary stages," he said.
   Mack is one of North America's largest producers of
heavy-duty diesel trucks. Mack also markets a line of
medium-duty diesel trucks throughout North America and parts
of Central America, Australia and New Zealand.

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush cleared the way for the

Czechoslovakia, and asked Congress to approve a bilateral

   The White House announced that the president has decided
to approve a waiver of the so-called Jackson-Vanik
restrictions in the 1974 trade act to permit extension of
U.S. tariff concessions to Czechoslovakian imports.
</LP>

   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Julius Katz said the Bush
administration hopes Congress will approve the waiver and the
trade accord before adjourning later this year.
   Both the trade agreement and waiver must be approved by
Congress before the U.S. can reduce its import duties on
products from Czechoslovakia. The approval would make that
country eligible for the same type of most favored nation
treatment given to imports from many other nations.

   Fail to Produce

   SEOUL, South Korea -- The high-level government meetings
between North and South Korea, the most talking the two
nations have ever done, ended with no real agreement
yesterday. But the talks were labeled a success anyway.
   "If it was anything less than a food fight at the end, it
is a great success," one analyst said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The talks were never billed as a prelude to German-style
reunification. The South Koreans and their allies had low
expectations going into the meeting, mainly because North
Korea has tried to avoid contact with the Seoul government.
It was the first time that the isolated and totalitarian
North Korea agreed to wide-ranging, high-level discussions
with South Korea, a nation it invaded 40 years ago and which
it still considers illegitimate.
   North Korean government spokesman Ahn Pyong Su told
reporters, "Despite the lack of remarkable agreements, the
two sides laid the foundation for expanded dialogue by fully
presenting their positions." And President Roh Tae Woo asked
the visiting North Korean premier, Yon Hyong Muk, to carry
back the South Korean leader's request for a summit meeting
with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung to set the stage for
reunification before the end of the century.
   "Korea cannot remain the last divided nation on Earth,
separated by cold war," the president said.
   The meetings brought no change in the basic positions of
either side. But participants did agree in principle to
resume Red Cross talks on allowing cross-border visits by
members of families separated since the Korean War. The talks
have been suspended since December 1985.
   In another significant move, South Korea agreed to delay
its request for its admission to the United Nations this
year, while the two sides form a panel to discuss alternative
plans for U.N. entry. Pyongyang wants the two Koreas to
occupy one seat in the U.N., alternating it between North and
South. The South considers that impractical and wants the two
countries to enter simultaneously.
   And, in separate statements that summed up the tone for
the meetings, officials of the two sides said they also had
agreed to stop slandering each other, to recognize each
other's sovereignty, and to work toward disarming the heavily
militarized Korean peninsula.
   The North Korean premier and a retinue of about 80 aides
and reporters were to return to Pyongyang Friday morning.
   South Korean officials are to travel to that North Korean
capital next month for a second round of talks.
   But despite the broad agreement to continue talking, no
one is certain that further discussions will actually take
place. Most analysts had said that North Korea came to the
talks only because the Soviet Union, its major ally,
pressured it to. And while in Seoul, the North Korean side
tried frequently to irritate the South Korean government.
   Northern negotiators insisted on such issues as a single
U.N. seat, the removal of anti-tank barriers in the
demilitarized zone between the two countries, an end to
Seoul's joint military maneuvers with the U.S. and the
freeing of dissidents who were jailed after visiting North
Korea without South Korean government approval. "It was
almost a face-saving device on the North Koreans' part," said
Han Sung Joo, chairman of the political science department of
Korea University in Seoul.
   The South failed to get the North to agree to greater
contact between both sides; Seoul had hoped that bringing
North Korea out of its self-imposed isolation would hasten
change there.
   That isolation was apparent during the two days of talks.
A North Korean told a South Korean professor, who had visited
Pyongyang several times, that he was surprised by the lack of
cars and people in Seoul, an unusual observation in this city
of 15 million people and monumental traffic jams. "They were
trying hard to show they weren't impressed," said Prof. Han.
"If it was an eye-opener, they tried not to show it."

   Oil Industry Maps Strategy to Combat
   Spills, Leaving Alaska Out of the Picture

   After a year of study, the oil industry yesterday unveiled
a detailed $800 million, five-year program to improve its
ability to fight catastrophic oil spills off the U.S. coast.
   But the plan, which will create five regional response
centers nationwide, doesn't provide for such a center in
Alaska, the site of the worst oil spill in U.S. waters. And
that leaves Alaskan officials cold. "It's ludicrous not to
locate one of the primary response centers in Alaska," said
Terence O'Malley, spokesman for Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper.
"Alaska, which provides 25% of U.S. oil production, has more
coastline than the rest of the U.S. combined."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The program creates two organizations. The Marine Spill
Response Corp., a privately financed non-profit group, will
be responsible for cleaning up any huge oil spills occurring
in the lower 48 states. The Marine Preservation Association,
composed of twenty oil companies and a pipeline company, will
use the services of the Response Corp. and provide the
funding for the organization. The cost to the membership,
which is expected to grow to include terminal and shipping
operators, will be based on the quantities of oil they handle
in the waters covered by the plan.
   The newly created agencies replace the Petroleum Industry
Response Organization, formed by the industry several months
after the tanker Exxon Valdez rammed an underwater reef in
Alaskan waters last year, causing the largest oil spill in
U.S. history. At that time, the industry had projected that
creation of a nationwide response network would cost $250
million and take about a year. Officials of the Response
Corp. now project it will take about 30 months to get the
centers established and equipment in place.
   The new estimates project sharply higher costs to get the
new program off the ground, because "the industry initially
reacted in crisis mode," said G. Stephen Duca, vice president
of readiness for the Response Corp. "It hadn't had the
opportunity to check the prices of things when it made the
projection."
   For example, Mr. Duca said, the industry had originally
assumed that there were enough existing vessels and barges
for their needs. However, when they checked, they found that
few were available for charter or lease, so 16 vessels and 22
barges will have to be built. Of the $800 million allotted,
$315 million will go toward the construction of boats and
purchase of equipment.
   The Response Corp., which will employ nearly 400 people
and be based in Washington, is being designed to manage large
spills of as much as 216,000 barrels. It would not respond to
small spills unless local contractors and cooperatives
responsible for handling them are unable to.
   The plan puts regional centers in the New York-New Jersey
area; Port Everglades, Fla.; Lake Charles, La.; Port Heuneme,
Calif.; and Seattle. Each regional center will have four to
six areas where equipment and sometimes vessels and personnel
will be located.
   Alaskan officials say the plan is exactly what's needed to
combat huge spills, and with Alaska's vast coastline, those
officials want to be part of that program. But, according to
Mr. Duca, some state regulations passed earlier this year
stand in the way of a regional center in Alaska.
   Mr. Duca said that the industry found the liability issue
in Alaska especially troubling. Alaska's oil-spill laws now
have a clause that provides for damage claims without proof
of gross negligence. It also demands that cleanup crews be
able to respond within 72 hours to spills 50% bigger than the
Exxon Valdez, he said. "Nobody can reasonably meet a 72-hour
deadline for a 300,000-barrel spill," Mr. Duca said.
   In an announcement, officials of the Response Corp. said
that they intend to have "an appropriate response and cleanup
role in Alaska." But they added that the role "is not yet
fully defined."
   Recently passed federal oil spill legislation limits
liability but doesn't pre-empt some state laws -- including
Alaska's -- that don't limit liability. Mr. Duca said the new
corporation is currently holding talks with some of these
states in efforts to have them adjust their regulations to
the new federal standard. "We need constructive dialogue," he
said.
   Currently, Alaska must depend on cleanup plans implemented
by Alyeska Pipeline Co. And in case of a severe crisis, the
state could get additional assistance from the regional
center to be established near Seattle. But "Seattle is pretty
far from Prince William Sound," said Gary Hayden, deputy
commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental
Conservation.
   Alyeska, which is responsible for handling spills in
Prince William Sound only, has beefed up its response
capability since its poor performance during the Exxon Valdez
disaster. But asked whether Alyeska's ability to respond to a
giant spill is now sufficient, Mr. Hayden said, "Not today,
it isn't."

   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan said his reading of the Fed's most recent survey of
bank officers is that "a substantial minority" further
tightened lending standards this summer.
   "The tightening was noticeable for medium-sized businesses
but extended as well to large and smaller firms," Mr.
Greenspan said in written replies to questions from the
Senate Banking Committee.

   The Fed released the results of its regular survey of
senior loan officers at the end of August, but Mr. Greenspan
hadn't commented on them publicly before. The Fed chairman
described the survey as "a reliable indicator of current
thinking at large commercial banks."
   When the Fed nudged down short-term interest rates in
July, Mr. Greenspan told the banking committee that the Fed
was trying to offset the effects of the credit crunch. He
said the Fed might ease them again if it saw evidence that
the credit crunch was worsening.
   Fed officials said late last month that they lean toward
further easing, but are reluctant to move until financial
markets, roiled by the Persian Gulf crisis, calm down.
   As previously reported, 43% of the domestic banks surveyed
in August said they had raised the hurdles for lending to
medium-size companies since May. More than a third reported
more stringent standards for large and small borrowers.

   WASHINGTON -- A dissident group led by David C. Walentas
said it has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to
investigate information it says casts doubt on the legitimacy
of a proposal for a business combination between Builders
Transport Inc. and Comcar Industries Inc.
   In a letter to the SEC, Mr. Walentas said a trucking
industry executive told him that he learned from a Comcar
executive that the February letter of intent between the two
companies was signed by Comcar as a favor to Charles C. Gay
Sr., chairman of Builders Transport at the time.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Walentas said in an interview that Builders Transport,
a truckload carrier based in Camden, S.C., was "trying to
repel" his group's December proposal to acquire the company
at $13 a share, or $54.6 million, which he said the company
"rejected out of hand without speaking to us."
   Following the announcement of the Comcar proposal,
Builders Transport's common stock rose from $9.75 a share to
$13.25 a share. Builders Transport said in June that Comcar
wasn't willing to proceed with the transaction.
   Robert Garner, general counsel of Builders Transport,
denied Mr. Walentas's allegations. "We never would have
entered into an agreement with Comcar if we had any reason to
doubt the legitimacy . . . of (Comcar's) offer," Mr. Garner
said.
   Mr. Garner said Builders Transport is continuing
discussions with another suitor, Trism Inc., which it said is
pursuing financing for an offer.

   Environment:
   Plan for Texas-Size Deep-Water Platform
   May Shield Shore From Oil-Tanker Spills

   HOUSTON -- An oil-industry consortium has quietly stepped
up development work on a possible giant offshore platform in
the Gulf of Mexico at which supertankers would unload far
from beaches and crowded ports.
   Advocates of the facility say it could substantially cut
chances of shoreline damage from oil spills. But the project
has sparked criticism from some quarters on the grounds that
it may thwart a movement toward double-hulled tankers, which
are also aimed at reducing spills.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The system, called TexPort, would become only the second
such offshore unloading facility in the U.S. and would cost
from $600 million to $1.3 billion, depending on its capacity.
A decision on whether to go ahead with construction is
expected in about six months. The only similar facility is
the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, or LOOP.
   In its more than eight years of operation LOOP claims it
has never had a significant oil spill. "We haven't {had any
spills}, and you shouldn't from a deep-water port," says
William C. Foster, a Washington lobbyist for LOOP.
   If constructed at its largest size, the platform under
consideration would be able to unload and send ashore by
pipeline as much as two million barrels of crude oil a day.
That's about one-third of all such U.S. imports. Taken
together, TexPort and LOOP at full capacity could unload more
than half the crude the U.S. buys right now.
   The possible venture has widespread environmental support
along the Gulf Coast. "In the past year Texans have had to
watch almost helplessly as more than five million gallons of
crude oil or petroleum products have been spilled along the
Texas Gulf Coast," says Texas Railroad Commissioner John
Sharp. A project like TexPort "could eliminate the potential
for harbor accidents and resulting harmful spills," he
contends.
   "You've got improved odds," agrees Charlie Mast, vice
president of crude-oil supply for Amoco Corp., which has
expressed "definite interest" in the project. The
environmental attractiveness gives TexPort "a plus" in
planners' minds and regulators who would have to approve any
such project, he says.
   At a closed-door meeting earlier this week, the industry
group, including representatives from Exxon Corp., Mobil
Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co. and the Shell Oil Co. unit of
Royal Dutch/Shell Group, agreed to go ahead with Phase Two of
the project, which includes a marketing study and examination
of regulatory hurdles.
   Planners say the TexPort platform would sit off of
Freeport, Texas, in about 110 feet of water, deep enough to
accommodate almost all of the world's giant oil tankers.
Incoming vessels would tie up to buoys and connect to hoses
that run from them to the sea floor. A pipeline under the sea
bottom would then take the oil to the central pumping and
control platform. From there, two larger undersea pipelines
would move crude ashore and five miles inland to a "tank
farm" that could store as much as 24 million barrels.
   From the storage facility, the oil could move through any
part of a spiderweb of existing pipelines that serve the
scores of refining and petrochemical plants near the Texas
coast. It could also move north through some commercial
pipelines.
   Engineering, cost and economic studies have already
declared the project is viable, says Jim Stephens, a manager
for Phillips Petroleum Co., which has been acting as the
consortium's lead company. He says the group now consists of
18 concerns, though some could leave the project at any time.
If a decision is made to build the facility, construction and
approvals necessary for full operation could take five years,
those involved say.
   Others including Phillips have considered building
deep-water ports in the past. Coastal Corp. even received
government approval for an offshore terminal in 1981, but
never built one because it couldn't round up enough partners.
However, "The environmental concern was not a big factor back
then," recalls a Coastal official.
   The logistics of moving a growing stream of Middle East
oil through a clogged U.S. distribution infrastructure were
behind construction of LOOP in the late 1970s. "The large
tankers couldn't come to shore," explains a spokesman for
Ashland Oil Inc., one of the five oil companies that own
LOOP.
   Similar concerns are now a big factor in TexPort. Imports
account for 50% of domestic oil consumption, and more and
more Middle East oil is expected in the years ahead. The most
economic way to ship oil to the U.S. from there is on
supertankers too big to dock at any domestic onshore ports.
Such ships can either unload at LOOP or anchor and pump their
cargo into several smaller vessels in a process called
lightering. "We don't know if ports on the Texas coast can
accommodate all the traffic" that process could generate,
says Mr. Stephens of Phillips.
   "Eventually we'll need {TexPort}," says Bernard Picchi, an
analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. But he wonders about the
timing. In the early '80s, just as LOOP was coming on line,
conservation efforts and other factors in the U.S. led to a
drop in Mideast imports. As a result, LOOP didn't make a dime
until last year.

   PITTSBURGH -- In the middle of an interview in Alan S.
Fellheimer's office here, a reporter scribbles "volatile" in
his notebook. From across the walnut table, the chairman of
troubled Equimark Corp. booms: "Damn right I'm volatile] And
I read upside-down, too]"
   Yesterday, Mr. Fellheimer showed he can also read the
writing on the wall. He resigned.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the past year, the bank holding company has stumbled
from one miscue to the next. It has been spilling red ink
from an overly ambitious growth strategy. It announced last
week that it is suspending its quarterly dividend, prompting
speculation that the company's outlook is bleaker than
thought.
   Federal regulators are reviewing expenses Equimark
incurred while running an insolvent Texas bank. Some top
executives have been fired. The brusque, controversial Mr.
Fellheimer has been accused of self-enrichment and nepotism.
   The multibillionaire Tisch family disclosed last week that
a family company, FLF Associates, has built a 6.8% stake in
Equimark. The Tisches, who have a reputation for savvy
investing, aren't talking, but they may have been betting
that Mr. Fellheimer would quit, allowing the company to win
back investors who had lost patience with what they saw as
Mr. Fellheimer's rocky management, flamboyant life style --
and, mostly, the firm's recent poor performance.
   The 47-year-old Mr. Fellheimer announced his resignation
late yesterday afternoon after failing to persuade this
newspaper to delay an article reporting that he was about to
leave.
   In a telephone interview, Mr. Fellheimer insisted he
hadn't been pressured to go. "The company needs stable
hands-on management," he said, "and I'm a turnaround
builder." He said he will remain on Equimark's board and has
"no current intention" of selling his 8% stake, the second
largest holding in the company. (The biggest holder is FMR
Corp. of Boston, the holding company for the Fidelity group
of mutual funds.)
   Mr. Fellheimer had been on thin ice at Equimark for
months. The board deliberated for more than six hours in May
before voting to keep him, and in recent weeks it met again
to weigh his fate, people familiar with the situation say.
   His departure marks the end of a turbulent five-year
reign. Once a take-no-prisoners loan collector known for his
volcanic temper, he ruled Equimark with autocratic zeal --
whether forcing other people off elevators so they wouldn't
stop at other floors or ripping film from the camera of a
photographer he felt had slighted him. Directors, most of
whom he appointed, tolerated his behavior as long as the bank
produced.
   One of his bolder moves was promoting his wife, Judith, to
vice chairman of Equimark's main bank unit, Equibank, in
February of this year. But in June, under pressure from
directors, he dismissed her.
   As that move demonstrated, the board's patience for Mr.
Fellheimer dissipated as Equimark's financial condition
declined. Critics claimed that the bank was battered by Mr.
Fellheimer's outsized ambitions.
   A lawyer by training, he joined Equimark as a consultant
in 1984, when federal regulators were threatening to shut the
bank because it had lost $80 million the previous four years
and desperately needed fresh capital.
   Mr. Fellheimer was named chairman in 1985. Over the years,
he bolstered Equimark's balance sheet by cutting costs,
selling assets such as the credit-card business, marketing
aggressively to consumers and small businesses, and
collecting loans.
   He played a big role initially in raising $100 million for
Equimark and collecting $250 million in bad loans. He once
said the hardest part of collecting from delinquent borrowers
"is trying to figure out when to punch them in the nose and
when to lift them up by the elbow."
   His methods included hiring a former Israeli tank
commander to pursue delinquent Third World borrowers.
   In 1985, the year Mr. Fellheimer took over, Equimark lost
$18.5 million before non-recurring items. The following year,
it chalked up $4.2 million in profits before one-time items
by collecting problem loans and increasing the bank's loan
portfolio.
   Profit growth continued for the next three years, with
Equimark earning $22.3 million in 1989. During these years,
it also benefited from its Equimanagement consulting unit,
which worked at ailing banks and evidently convinced Mr.
Fellheimer he could turn around any sick institution.
   Assets jumped to $3.8 billion at the end of 1989 from $2.2
billion in 1985. Meantime, Equimark provided some good
consumer products; its automatic teller machines even provide
postage stamps.
   Mr. Fellheimer went on an acquisition binge into far-flung
places. He believed he could go anywhere in the country to
fix or acquire ailing banks, once comparing his strategy to
MacArthur conquering the South Pacific.
   Equimark bought Liberty Savings Bank in Philadelphia,
Treasure Valley Bank in Boise, Idaho, a minority interest in
a small money-losing thrift in Cheyenne, Wyo., and two
profitable financing companies in Tampa, Fla.
   During the good years, former company executives now say,
they worried that Equimark's acquistion strategy was too much
to handle for a relatively small bank.
   Liberty Savings was losing money when Equimark bought it
in 1987; last year, plagued by bad real-estate loans, it lost
another $1.8 million. Treasure Valley was also a losing bank
when Equimark bought it, and still is. And aside from the
monetary losses, those acquisitions and others increasingly
drained Equimark's resources from a reasonably strong
Pittsburgh operation.
   Company executives also worried about aggressive lending,
which Mr. Fellheimer used to boost the bank while the economy
was good. When the Northeast real estate and consumer credit
markets soured, his inexperience caught up with him.
   In one instance, according to company employees, the
Equibank unit lent $11 million to a Pittsburgh developer who
wanted to transform a one-time boxing arena into a fancy
shopping mall. The development, called Motor Square Garden,
opened in 1988, but closed about 20 months later. With only
one restaurant and no nightclubs, the mall never drew enough
customers to support the pricey boutiques.
   Motor Square Garden now has only one tenant: an Equibank
branch. The building is for sale for $5.9 million, and
company employees say the bank has written off part of the
loan.
   With such problems, Equimark posted a first-half loss of
$45.2 million before one-time gains this year. The stock
price has fallen steadily for more than a year. The stock
closed at 4 7/8 yesterday, unchanged, before Mr. Fellheimer's
announcement.
   Mr. Fellheimer's biggest disappointment came in San
Antonio, where Equimark was thwarted in its efforts to buy
National Bancshares Corp. of Texas in a federally assisted
$116 million buy-out.
   National Bancshares was to have been the linchpin of
Equimark's future growth. When Equimark decided to buy the
bank, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. allowed Mr.
Fellheimer and his troops to move in and manage it until the
expected sale went through.
   Mr. Fellheimer drove around recession-weary San Antonio in
a black Rolls-Royce, joined an expensive country club and
lived in a $445,000 company-paid condominium, with tennis
courts, a swimming pool and putting green.
   "It was a cultural train wreck from day one," says Mike
Molak, a commercial lending officer at Bank One of San
Antonio who worked at National Bancshares while Mr.
Fellheimer was in charge. "They did a lot of screaming into
the telephone with career bankers who'd been here 20 years
and didn't have any blood on their hands. It was a slap in
the face."
   Pradeep Bhargava, a former senior vice president at
National Bancshares, recalls senior management meetings in
which Mr. Fellheimer and other Equimark executives would
dismiss bank personnel's budget plans out of hand. "Everyone
was just totally shellshocked," he says. "I think they just
wanted to come in and say, `We are in control.'"
   Mr. Bhargava says Mr. Fellheimer didn't tolerate dissent
-- an observation many former colleagues make. "If he's in
charge you feel like you have to shut up or go away from
him," says Mr. Bhargava, who now works for Sears Financial
Network in Chicago. "If you say something that he doesn't
like, you could be in deep trouble."
   Adds Matt Ralls, a former lending officer at National
Bancshares, which has since been acquired by NCNB Corp. of
Charlotte, N.C., "I'd tell Alan he would scare people when he
would come out of his chair. He'd say, `That's because I'm a
scary guy.'"
   In past interviews, Mr. Fellheimer said he was well
received in San Antonio, had collected $100 million in bad
loans and was bringing business back to the bank. He said he
used the country club and the condo to entertain customers.
"What do you want me to do, live in a hovel?" he asked.
   The National Bancshares deal collapsed when creditors held
out for more money and federal regulators wouldn't allow Mr.
Fellheimer to sweeten Equimark's offer. But during the nine
months that Equimark managed National Bancshares, it ran up a
bill for more than $10 million, which was charged to the
government.
   The FDIC says it is reviewing how the money was spent and
will ask for at least partial reimbursement. Among the
alleged expenses is a $1,400 bill for transporting Mr.
Fellheimer's Rolls-Royce to San Antonio from Pittsburgh. Mr.
Fellheimer says he personally paid the transportation costs
and denies any misuse of money.
   Regulators are also examining travel and lodging expenses.
   Mr. Fellheimer has his supporters, who admire his
street-smart savvy and his willingness to roil the staid
banking community. But critics charge that he enriched
himself and his family while delivering harsh medicine to
turn around Equimark. In 1986, he instituted an
across-the-board 10% pay cut, which was eventually restored.
   Mr. Fellheimer's base salary was $495,000, but he had a
lucrative bonus package. Last year, he earned $1.2 million;
that made him the only executive at banks with less than $5
billion in assets to make more than $1 million, according to
SNL Securities, a bank research firm in Charlottesville, Va.
   The Fellheimers' home in Sewickley, a wealthy Pittsburgh
suburb, is on a sprawling tree-lined estate with a
cobblestone drive, lighted tennis courts, swimming pool,
fountains and three-car garage. They also own a house in Boca
Raton, Fla.
   A nervous man who once had his office swept for computer
bugs, Mr. Fellheimer was never shy about his ambitions. "I
like to build and I like to fix," he said this summer from
his office, the outside walls lined with framed newspaper
articles about himself. "I like to make money. I want respect
and I want recognition just like the next guy, maybe more
so."
   While he drove his subordinates hard, Mr. Fellheimer
hasn't liked sharing the limelight. He once exposed a Forbes
photographer's film because, the magazine reported, the
photographer was shooting another executive without him in
the picture.
   His wife, Judith, herself a very tough executive with a
sharp tongue, rose through Equimark's ranks until she was the
fourth-highest-paid executive, earning $320,000 last year.
Her ascension rankled some board members and created
resentment among some employees.
   Mr. Fellheimer said his wife, also a lawyer who served as
chairman of the Equimanagement consulting unit, made a lot of
money for the company.
   But her ability was called into question as her efforts to
turn around Treasure Valley Bank in Boise, which Equimark
bought in 1989, didn't pan out. (Her son from a previous
marriage, Lee Eichen, was in charge of all eight branches of
the bank until last month. Though he had no bank management
experience, the 23-year-old Mr. Eichen was hired last year
right after he graduated with honors in economics from
Harvard University.)
   The small bank lost $203,000 last year, according to
Sheshunoff Information Services Inc., a consulting concern.
Mr. Fellheimer said he expects the bank to break even this
year.
   Mrs. Fellheimer, 47 years old, won't comment.
   Mr. Fellheimer has fiercely denied any charge of nepotism.
He says that promoting or hiring family members is in the
best tradition of American business, citing the Rockefellers,
the Fords and the Mellons. Besides, he says, it's been his
right to run the company as he saw fit.
   "I'm not some hired hand]" he fumes. "I've invested $11.5
million of my money in this company. This is a company that I
took from nothing and built from nothing."
   The most widely discussed possible successor to Mr.
Fellheimer is James C. Roddey, a director who runs a local
money management firm. Mr. Roddey won't comment.
   Where the Tisches fit in is unclear. More than half the
Equimark shares they acquired were bought in July and August
at $3.375 to $5.625 apiece, well below its 52-week high of
15. They maintain they're passive long-term investors,
although it's thought likely they'll play some role in
deciding the future direction of the bank.
   Opinions vary on Equimark's long-term prospects. But most
observers say it has a strong franchise in Western
Pennsylvania, and if it returns to its roots -- a niche bank
for small businesses and consumers -- it could prosper.
   As for Mr. Fellheimer, several months ago, during the
interview in his office, he took comfort in at least one
thought: "Even if I lose everything," he said, "Judy and I
can always go back to practicing law."
   And yesterday he said that's exactly what he plans to do.

   The Princeton, N.J., company said it expected to report
sales of about $185 million for fiscal 1990, ending Sept. 30.
In 1989, the company reported operating profit of $18 million
on revenue of $158 million.
   Prince said the transaction will provide much needed
capital for the company's plans to enter into other sporting
goods businesses such as golfing equipment and sports
apparel. In addition, the company said it decided to sell so
it could expand its world-wide sales efforts. "This sale will
enable Prince to continue its growth and development," said
John M. Sullivan, chairman of Prince Holdings.
   Prince was acquired in 1987 in a leveraged buy-out led by
senior management and Brentwood Associates, a Los
Angeles-based investment firm, from ChesebroughPonds Inc., a
unit of Unilever Group. In October 1988, it acquired Ektelon,
maker of racquetball equipment, from Browning, a unit of
Fabrique Nationale Herstal S.A. of Belgium.

   NEW YORK -- Prodigy announced several improvements to its
videotext service, including the availability of an
electronic encyclopedia and very fast updating of sports
scores.
   The joint venture between International Business Machines
Corp. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. also has speeded up the
service, which people use to shop, gather information and
communicate through personal computers connected to the
Prodigy service over phone lines. One of the main criticisms
of Prodigy over the past two years has been that it took too
long for the system to respond.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Prodigy, which now has 460,000 users in 270,000
households, said it expects that number to continue to grow
rapidly, to more than one million users by the end of next
year. Among other reasons, Prodigy said it has completed its
rollout of the service, so that it's now available
nationwide.
   Still, market researchers have said Prodigy needs millions
of users before it can start to turn a profit. Estimates of
IBM's and Sears's spending on Prodigy thus far range into
many hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Prodigy executives, who acknowledged that users have
bought fewer items through the service than had been
expected, remain optimistic that consumers will eventually
get used to shopping electronically.

   WASHINGTON -- Americans don't share President Bush's
reluctance to allow the Soviets to act as go-betweens in the
Middle East crisis, the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News
poll finds.
   Two-thirds of the voters surveyed said they would trust
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to represent U.S. interests
in negotiating peace with Iraq. Only 27% said they couldn't
trust him.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   President Bush meets with Mr. Gorbachev this weekend in
Helsinki, Finland, for what Mr. Bush's aides say will be an
"unstructured" session to shore up the growing U.S.-Soviet
alliance in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. While Mr.
Bush has repeatedly expressed gratitude for the Soviets'
support so far against their former ally, Bush administration
officials reject Moscow's suggestion to call an international
conference to discuss Middle East problems, including Iraq
and the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Mr. Bush has made clear
that the U.S. doesn't want Moscow playing a mediating role in
the Mideast and that he doesn't think the Soviets want to
play such a role.
   Although U.S. voters overall like Mr. Gorbachev as a
mediator, women and blacks are more inclined to share Mr.
Bush's skepticism about giving him such a role: only 60% of
women compared with 72% of men say they could trust Mr.
Gorbachev to represent U.S. interests. Only a third of black
voters trust Mr. Gorbachev as a mediator, vs. 70% of whites.

   NEW YORK -- Price Waterhouse said it received government
approval to conduct its own accounting and auditing, tax and
management consulting practice in the Soviet Union.
   The professional-services concern said it is the first
such organization to be authorized to develop a wholly owned,
multidisciplinary practice in the Soviet Union without
entering into a joint venture.

   Price Waterhouse has had an office in Moscow since
September 1989. It is recruiting staff directly from Soviet
universities. It has been staffing its office in Moscow with
a Russian-speaking expatriate staff.
   In June, the Soviet government granted permission to
Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., and Ernst &amp; Young to perform audits on
joint ventures of Soviet and Western companies. But those two
firms established their practices in the Soviet Union through
joint ventures with local entities.

   NEW YORK -- For the first time in eleven months, the
dollar fell below 141 yen and stayed there.
   The greenback was quoted in late New York trading at
140.70 yen, off one yen from late Wednesday and its worst
North American close since Oct. 2, 1989, when it ended at
139.70 yen. Until yesterday, Wednesday's New York close had
been the dollar's lowest for 1990.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at
140.45 yen, down from 141.65 yen at the close there Thursday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5558
marks, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.5566 marks.
   "The bottom just dropped out of" the dollar, said Javier
Santalla, a New York trader for Nippon Credit Bank. "There
was very little fanfare."
   Mr. Santalla and others insisted that the day's activity
was yen-based and not dollar-based. Though some speculators
got a head start on the dollar-selling they expect to be
spurred by a weak U.S. employment report today, the dollar
fell only slightly against the mark. It actually gained
against recent strong performers, such as the Swiss franc and
Canadian dollar.
   The U.S. currency was changing hands in late New York
trading at 1.5550 marks, down from 1.5585 marks late
Wednesday in New York. It climbed to 1.2975 Swiss francs from
1.2960 francs. Sterling was trading at $1.9125, up from
$1.9043.
   The U.S. and Japanese currencies are moving in opposite
directions along the lines of each nation's interest rates.
   The cost of Japanese funds, especially at the long end of
the yield curve, has continued to rise following the Bank of
Japan's decision last Thursday to raise its discount rate to
6% from 5.25%. Though at the time Bank of Japan Gov. Yasushi
Mieno said the market shouldn't expect another tightening in
the near future, the central bank's refusal since then to add
enough liquidity to keep rates down has fueled doubts.
   The result, Mr. Santalla said, is "a very strong case to
be in yen."
   U.S. rate watchers, meanwhile, are already counting on one
round of easing by the U.S Federal Reserve and think a second
may follow right on its heels if today's jobs report is
particularly lame.
   Already incorporated in dollar rates, said William
Sterling, an economist at Merrill Lynch, is a Fed move to
push the federal funds target rate down a quarter point to 7
3/4% from the currently assumed target of 8%. The only
question is one of timing. A weaker-than-expected report
could provoke an immediate response, he said.
   A really bad number, Mr. Sterling said, could launch "the
beginning of a series of moves" to ease credit. That, in
turn, would "heighten concern that the U.S. is willing to
pursue a policy of dollar depreciation to invigorate the
economy."
   Another cloud over the dollar is the federal budget
deficit. At a rally in Topeka, Kansas, yesterday, President
Bush pledged to eliminate the budget gap in five years -- or
two years later than the time frame set by the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.
   After breaking below 141 yen in early European trading,
the dollar rose above that level as New York began trading
before declining again.
   Technical charts signaled a dollar-buying opportunity at
140.60 yen, and kept the greenback from falling further, said
Susan Stearns, a senior corporate advisor in New York for
Chicago's Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank.
   Though yen-buying dominated the day, the Japanese currency
rose only marginally against its German counterpart. Less in
favor than the yen, the mark is nevertheless being supported
by a psychological floor at 90 yen and expectations that the
Bundesbank will match the recent Japanese rate increase.
   The mark closed New York trading at 90.482 yen, down from
90.921 yen late Wednesday.
   The Canadian dollar suffered from expectations of
interest-rate easing in its home country, falling to 86.48
U.S. cents in New York from 86.77 cents Wednesday.
   In Europe yesterday, the dollar ended little changed from
where it began the European trading day, as dealers said
participants awaited developments on several fronts.
   In Asia, the dollar ended active dealings mostly lower as
a brief flurry of covering short dollar positions was
overcome by bearish sentiment toward the U.S. economy. The
U.S. currency finished Thursday in Tokyo at 141.65 yen, below
142.30 yen late Wednesday.
   News about an American in Kuwait being shot added momentum
to a round of short-covering that had gotten under way after
the dollar dropped to 141.25 yen in early Asian trading.
   But after the wave of short-covering lifted the dollar as
high as 142.45 yen, continued pessimism about the U.S.
economy helped prompt dollar sales by life insurance
companies and other institutional investors, pushing the U.S.
currency back down.
   Separately, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
for current delivery settled at $389.70 an ounce, up $3.60.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.7 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $390.25 an ounce.

   Oil Prices Jump
   Amid Pessimism
   On Gulf Crisis

   Fear of Winter Shortages
   Also Helps Some Crudes
   Rise Beyond $31 a Barrel

   World oil prices surged again on panic and some
speculative buying that began in Asia and Europe and spread
to the U.S.
   The price increase, sparked by growing pessimism over the
Persian Gulf crisis and the petroleum supply outlook for
winter, bounced some crude prices beyond $31 a barrel. The
higher prices helped some oil company stocks but contributed
to declines in U.S. stock and bond markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The steep rise in petroleum prices -- more than $1 a
barrel for most crudes -- came even as some small oil
exporters planned to try to follow leading members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in raising
output. Trinidad, Malaysia and others were said yesterday to
be among those planning to increase output, to add to the
higher volumes already being produced by Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and some other OPEC nations.
   Also yesterday, Mexico said its extra 100,000 barrels a
day of oil exports will continue until the end of the year,
rather than the end of this month as originally pledged.
   However, most non-OPEC oil producers already are believed
to be running flat out. There is considerable skepticism
whether any of them can produce much more oil, even in modest
increments. Also, there is doubt the new OPEC supplies can
replace all the oil lost from the embargo against Iraq -- or
can reach the oil market in time to fill the gap left by the
4.3 million barrels a day of former Iraqi and Kuwaiti
exports.
   "Temporarily, there is a lag between the cutoffs {of Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil} and the increased production," said Roger W.
Gale, president of the Washington International Energy Group,
a consulting firm. That gap is going to be showing up, he
said, in reductions in volume in the oil market, where demand
already is rising seasonally.
   The main concern among energy watchdogs for major
oil-consuming nations, such as the Paris-based International
Energy Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy, is that the
biggest potential for tight supplies, and possibly shortages,
will be during the winter peak-use period. It could start as
early as November as the heating-oil season gets under way in
colder climates.
   Heating oil, in fact, set yesterday's pricing pace. In
heavy U.S. futures trading, heating oil for October delivery
rose 4.87 cents a gallon to settle at 88.24 cents. Unleaded
gasoline for October delivery settled at 95.07 cents, up 2.8
cents a gallon.
   The crude traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
which is similar to the benchmark West Texas Intermediate,
jumped $1.66 a barrel to settle at $31.43 for October
delivery.
   Another wave of higher price postings swept through the
oil fields, meanwhile, with refiners generally raising the
prices they pay for West Texas Intermediate by $1.75 a
barrel, to as much as $30.
   The gains in U.S. prices followed jumps in Asia and
Europe. Spot prices of Europe's North Sea crudes were up by
$1 to $1.20 a barrel. Some trading officials said this
underscores a shift from U.S. pricing leadership.
   "The driving force in the markets today is in Europe and
in the Far East," said Peter Gignoux, London-based manager of
the Shearson Lehman Hutton international energy desk. He said
strong European currencies and a weak U.S. dollar -- the
currency used to price and pay for oil -- make up one reason.
Another, he said, is that European and Asian buyers expect
supply disruptions by the fourth quarter.
   Many traders expressed surprise, nevertheless, at the high
levels oil prices are again reaching. Some look for a major
pullback, possibly as soon as today, similar to the
$4-a-barrel drop that followed the August price surge kicked
off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the resulting U.S.-Iraq
armed faceoff in the Gulf region.
   Price corrections are sure to come if supplies prove
adequate after all the talk of possible shortages. And the
higher prices are helping to bring on new supplies. Mexico
will continue its increased oil exports for the remainder of
the year "to take advantage of rising prices," Petroleos de
Mexicanos said in its announcement yesterday.
   Charles A. Gargano, U.S. ambassador to Trinidad, said in
an interview that Trinidad is considering a 5% to 10%
increase in its production of some 150,000 barrels a day
after his request to government oil authorities.
   "We have asked all our friends who are oil producers to
help out the situation now," he said. Any output increase
there "may be small," he said, "but it's symbolic they are
willing to try to help."

   Insurers' Net Plunged
   21% on Higher Losses
   During the First Half

   U.S. property/casualty insurers saw net income plunge 21%
to $5.2 billion during the first half of 1990 as lower
premium rates and higher underwriting losses continued to
plague the industry.
   Because of the price war that has gripped the
property/casualty industry for nearly four years now,
premiums grew just 3.8% in the first half to $105.3 billion.
However, underwriting losses jumped 29% to $10.6 billion from
$8.2 billion in the 1989 first half.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pretax operating profit fell 23% to $5.1 billion from $6.7
billion a year earlier.
   Sean Mooney, an economist with the Insurance Information
Institute, said the financial results for the
property/casualty insurers deserve a "C-minus" because of
decreasing after-tax profits and relatively low rate of
return. "The industry continues to muddle along, with no
clear sign of a financial upturn."
   He said the second-quarter results were pretty telling,
when net fell 3.6% to $2.7 billion for the industry. Relative
to premiums, after-tax earnings in the second quarter stood
at 5.1%. That means that for every premium dollar, the
industry's profit was five cents. Mr. Mooney noted that such
results were lower than the profit margin for most industries
of seven cents on the sales dollar.
   The industry data, compiled by the Insurance Services
Office and the National Association of Independent Insurers,
includes results for 96% of the property/casualty companies
in the country.

   NEW YORK -- Telemedia Inc., a Montreal-based media
company, has closed New England Monthly magazine, citing a
sluggish advertising market and an ailing regional economy.
   The folding of the critically praised magazine is a
setback to the ambitious U.S. expansion plans of Telemedia,
one of Canada's largest media companies. In the U.S.,
Telemedia also publishes Harrowsmith Country Life and a new
epicurean magazine, Eating Well, launched in July. In Canada,
Telemedia owns 15 consumer magazines, 27 radio stations and
20 weekly newspapers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The staff of the regional prize-winning monthly was told
the magazine would be closed yesterday. Its September issue,
now on newsstands, will be its last.
   Telemedia said the magazine was facing "mounting losses,"
and that advertising revenue for the magazine had fallen by
$1 million so far in 1990.
   "After a $5 million effort to make a profit, the most
prudent thing to do is to shut the magazine down rather than
continue to build up debt," John Van de Kamer, president and
chairman of Telemedia, said in a statement.
   Telemedia had attempted to sell the Haydenville,
Mass.-based publication, but couldn't find a buyer. The
magazine, started in 1984, had been nominated every year for
a National Magazine Award, and twice was winner in the
General Excellence category.

   Surge; Retailing Issues Hit Hard

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices tumbled, dragged down by the
latest surge in oil prices and concerns about the potential
escalation of tensions in the Middle East.
   Retailing issues were hit especially hard amid the release
of weak August sales reports, evidence of consumers'
nervousness about the state of the economy and the Mideast
crisis. Investors also dumped Motorola's stock after analysts
lowered their earnings expectations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has closed within
a trading range of about 40 points since the start of last
week, approached the low end of that range by tumbling 31.93
to 2596.29.
   Among broader indexes, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
dropped 3.93 to 320.46, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index dropped 1.87 to 176.06 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index fell 3.43 to 296.92.
   Declining issues routed advancers by 960 to 511 on the Big
Board. Trading activity remained slow; volume totaled
125,620,000 shares, up slightly from 120,610,000 Wednesday.
   Stocks headed lower from the opening bell, and the
sell-off gained momentum as the price of oil rallied above
$30 a barrel -- a level reached two weeks ago for the first
time since the early 1980s -- and then broke through the
$31-a-barrel mark. October crude-oil futures closed in New
York at $31.43 a barrel, up $1.66.
   Reports that a U.S. citizen had been shot and wounded by
an Iraqi soldier in Kuwait and that the U.S. government is
telling Americans still in Kuwait to prepare for an
evacuation unsettled the market, traders said, as did rumors
of other shootings of Americans.
   "The market's an emotional nightmare," said Thomas
Gallagher, managing director in charge of capital commitment
at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., and will remain that way until
"something concrete comes out" to produce a resolution of the
Middle East crisis.
   "The longer this goes on, the more concerned people
become," he says, and the worries are leading investors to
either walk away from the market or focus only on "very safe
stocks."
   Limited Inc., which reported that sales for stores open at
least one year went up just 1% in August, tumbled 1 1/8 to 15
5/8 as more than 1.9 million shares changed hands.
   Two other retailing stocks finished right behind Limited
on the most actives list Wal-Mart Stores went down 7/8 to 27
1/2 as 1.9 million shares were traded, while Toys "R" Us fell
3/4 to 23 3/4 on 1.8 million shares.
   Sears Roebuck, which reported a 4.1% August sales gain for
stores open at least a year, retreated 1/2 to 29. As for
other major retailers, K mart dropped 3/8 to 27 1/8, J.C.
Penney skidded 1 to 45 7/8, Dayton Hudson fell 1 to 57 1/4,
Woolworth dipped 7/8 to 24 1/2 and Gap Inc. lost 1 7/8 to 53
1/8.
   Carmine Grigoli, chief equity portfolio strategist at
First Boston, said retail sales are likely to weaken further
over the next few months, since consumers haven't yet felt
the full impact of rising oil prices.
   "As that filters through, you can logically expect
spending to be cut back further, and that will weaken overall
economic activity," Mr. Grigoli said. "The economy seems to
be moving to the point of no return, and a recession appears
more likely."
   Against that backdrop, he said, further disappointments in
corporate earnings can be expected in the third and fourth
quarters of this year -- "something that will certainly weigh
heavily on equity investors."
   Motorola plunged 7 5/8 to 61 1/2 on 2.3 million shares
after analysts at a number of brokerage firms lowered
earnings estimates in response to concerns about the strength
of the company's business in a weakening economic
environment.
   Smith Barney, Harris Upham lowered its investment rating
on Motorola to "avoid" from "hold." Analyst James L. Barlage,
noting that he had lowered estimates on the company and other
chipmakers more than a month ago, told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report the company has been developing "structural
weaknesses," citing softness in its communications business
and continuing losses in its computer business.
   Paramount Communications dropped 5/8 to 34 7/8. Chairman
Martin S. Davis said earnings for the fiscal year ending in
October will be "at the lower end" of the company's
forecasted range of $2.10 to $2.60 a share.
   Fedders, which said it expects to report losses for the
third and fourth quarters as a result of weak sales,
retreated 1 3/4 to 7 3/8.
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber fell 7/8 to 22 1/4 after
forecasting a third-quarter loss of about $65 million,
reflecting planned charges of about $51 million for
additional restructuring of its tire operations and
environmental cleanup work.
   MNC Financial lost 3/4 to 5 7/8 on nearly one million
shares. Rumors that Alfred Lerner, an MNC director, might
back out of an agreement to boost the bank holding company's
capital through the purchase of $180 million in preferred
stock fueled the stock's downturn, according to the Dow Jones
investor report. The company said it wasn't aware of any
change of heart by Mr. Lerner, who couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Meanwhile, major oil stocks closed mixed despite the
latest surge in oil prices.
   Exxon fell 1/2 to 50 3/8 on 1.8 million shares, while
Chevron went up 1/8 to 77 3/4, Texaco rose 1/4 to 64, Mobil
added 1/2 to 66 1/4, Amoco ended unchanged at 57 3/4 and
Atlantic Richfield closed unchanged at 138 3/4.
   Other energy issues fared better, with shares of several
gas-pipeline companies among the standouts. Enron climbed 3
3/8 to 55 3/8, Arkla added 1/2 to 19 7/8, Transco Energy rose
1 3/8 to 45 3/8 and Coastal rose 5/8 to 37.
   Edison Brothers Stores, bucking the drop among retailers,
gained 1 1/4 to 26 3/4. The company reported that its fiscal
second-quarter earnings were up 25.9% from a year earlier and
its August sales were up 17.5% overall. Also, its board
approved the repurchase of as many as one million common
shares, or about 4.7% of its shares outstanding.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.91
to 324.50. Volume totaled 10,560,000 shares.

   ATLANTA -- The Centers for Disease Control said several
state health agencies have detected "unusually early and high
levels" of mosquitoes carrying viruses that cause
encephalitis, indicating "a potential risk for epidemic
transmission" to people.
   The CDC said surveillance conducted in Texas, Florida,
Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York of birds and
mosquitoes that are involved in the cyclical transmission of
the viruses signals a potential for a higher incidence of
encephalitis in humans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We don't want to alarm people unnecessarily," said Dr.
Ted Tsai, assistant director for science at the CDC division
of vector-borne infectious diseases in Atlanta. "To be
conservative, what we'd like to say is there is more of the
virus being transmitted in nature than is usual, so there's a
potential, or possibility, that it could lead to a higher
occurrence in people than usual."
   The CDC said St. Louis Encephalitis, the more common type
transmitted by the mosquito vectors, is the leading cause of
epidemic encephalitis in the U.S. The last major outbreak, in
1975, resulted in nearly 3,000 cases of the disease, which
has a 7% fatality rate.
   The CDC said various states, including Massachusetts, New
York and Florida, have already stepped up mosquito-control
efforts to battle the spread of the viruses.

   MADISON, Wis. -- The food fight is over.
   Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. said it agreed to settle the
patent infringement lawsuit it filed in January that accused
Sara Lee Corp. of copying its design for a ready-to-eat
product called "Lunchables."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under terms of the agreement, Sara Lee will, among other

   Oscar Mayer said a design change that Sara Lee has already
made wasn't satisfactory.
   Oscar Mayer wouldn't disclose the sum that it said Sara
Lee will pay it as a retroactive royalty on the packages that
Sara Lee has already produced.
   Oscar Mayer's ready-to-eat "Lunchables" line and the
"Lunch 'n Munch" line sold by Sara Lee contain trays of
cheese, crackers and processed meat.
   Oscar Mayer complained that the Sara Lee package was too
similar to its own -- a square see-through box containing a
three-compartment tray.
   A Sara Lee spokeswoman said the company wouldn't comment.

transmission cable along selected routes on the Southern
electric system.
   Barton, based in Shawnee, Okla., said the engineering and
installation will be performed by Atlanta-based Southern
electric system and that Barton, a maker of oil field
equipment, will reimburse Southern for the costs. Barton
wouldn't disclose the anticipated costs.

   Foreign Airlines Receive Top 10 Spots
   In Rating Survey of American Fliers

   CHICAGO -- Just as many Americans think Japanese cars are
better-built and Swiss clocks better-timed, U.S. fliers think
foreign carriers are the way to fly.
   No U.S. airline broke the top 10 rank in an airline survey
released yesterday by the researchers of Zagat's Restaurant
Survey. Primarily European and Asian carriers were on top,
but one Latin American surprise -- Brazil's Varig airlines --
also cracked the top 10.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The internationals killed the domestics," said Nick
Tortorello, chairman of Research and Forecasts Inc., which
analyzed the data for Zagat's. "There are some things that
the domestic airlines could learn from the internationals."
   Singapore Airlines, Swissair and Japan Air Lines held the
top three slots in the survey. Singapore's farewell gifts,
Swissair's chocolates and JAL's sushi win those airlines
points.
   The airline survey, conducted between January and June,
was based on responses from 4,463 fliers participating in a
broader travel poll of hotels and car rental agencies. The
results of those polls will be released later this year. The
fliers scored 27 carriers on comfort, service, timeliness,
food and cost. Zagat researchers compiled a rating based on
everything but cost.
   The best ranking fliers could give a U.S. carrier was the
number 11 position. That was captured by AMR Corp.'s American
Airlines unit. U.S. airlines couldn't break the top 10 list
either for the separate categories of comfort, service and
food. In the overall ratings, Eastern Airlines only beat the
Soviet Union's Aeroflot, which was rated the worst.
   "Does our domestic service hurt us? Sure, it does," says
George Mueller, vice president of customer service at
American. "It would be foolhardy for me to say that our
service between Dallas and Chicago is the same as our service
to Frankfurt."
   Many Americans say service in the airline industry
particularly withered during the merger fever and
blood-letting competition that followed the deregulation of
the industry in 1978.
   "There certainly is a perception that there are a lot of
things wrong with U.S. airlines," says Tim Zagat, editor of
the survey carrying his name. U.S. fliers "look at the
industry as being in considerable disarray," he says.
   UAL Corp.'s United Airlines is in the middle of a $4.38
billion employee-led buy-out. NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines
is highly leveraged after a $3.65 billion takeover took it
private last year. Eastern Airlines has been operating under
bankruptcy-law protection since spring 1989.
   "After deregulation, the U.S. carriers focused on price as
their primary marketing tool and service started to
deteriorate," says Michael Derchin, an airlines analyst at
County NatWest Securities Corp. "Meanwhile, the international
airlines, which weren't deregulated, continued to focus on
service. That was the tradeoff that U.S. carriers had to
make."
   In the old days, passengers reminisce that if they needed
help putting their carry-on luggage in the overhead
compartments, flight attendants would help them. No longer,
they complain. Fliers mostly have to elicit the help of other
passengers while attendants watch.
   That's in stark contrast, they note, to service on foreign
carriers. Take Singapore Airlines where flight attendants
call passengers by name.
   U.S. public opinion about foreign airlines seems to
parallel attitudes about foreign-made cars. Only one U.S. car
manufacturer made a top 10 list of quality cars in a 1990
survey of car owners by J.D. Power &amp; Associates, an auto
market research company.
   Likewise, only three U.S. airlines broke a list of top 10
international airlines in a reader poll conducted by Business
Traveler International last year. Only one U.S. carrier in
the past 16 years has won a passenger service award presented
by Air Transport World, an industry publication.
   One reason U.S. airlines aren't as impressive: Many
foreign airlines are all or partly government-owned and they
receive subsidies that don't force them to watch the bottom
line like hawks. As a result, they can afford special
touches, airline experts say.
   Midway Airlines, based on Chicago's South Side, serves
meals shrink-wrapped. State-owned Thai Airways International,
in contrast, serves orchids with its meals.
   "Cost isn't as much a consideration for them as it is for
somebody like Bob Crandall," chairman of AMR, says Dana
Henderson, who conducted the Air Transport World survey. Mr.
Crandall once boasted about how he had cut costs by paring
olives from in-flight meals.
   Industry experts say that labor costs, the industry's
number one expense, are also much lower at some Asian
carriers, where work rules are typically looser and wages
cheaper.
   Industry travel experts admit that Americans might have an
inflated opinion of foreign carriers because they mostly fly
them on higher-grade international flights, where the
carriers can pamper fliers for hours. They rarely fly foreign
airlines on their domestic routes, where carriers such as Air
France are as hamstrung by air traffic delays as U.S.
carriers are stateside.

   Getty Petroleum Corp., a major independent gasoline
marketer, reported a fiscal second-quarter loss of $1.9
million, or 14 cents a share, after an inventory-related
charge of $3.3 million.
   At the same time, Getty said directors authorized the
purchase of as many as an additional 500,000 of its shares.
Under a 500,000-share authorization made in June 1989, Getty
has bought back 413,073 shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The net loss in the quarter ended July 31 compares with
net income of $1.9 million, or 14 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue rose 7.9% to $320.6 million from
$297.1 million, largely because of higher merchandise sales
at Getty's convenience stores and higher sales of gasoline to
wholesalers.
   But earnings were hurt, Getty said, because of volatility
in its product costs and because "the significant increase in
petroleum prices during the second quarter could not be
passed along" to customers "because of competitive marketing
conditions."

   Tokyo stocks posted conservative losses in thin activity
Thursday. The Nikkei Index dropped under arbitrage selling
and short-term profit-taking, but then partially recovered on
Japanese brokerage house-driven buying, traders said.
   In London, shares closed sharply lower and at the day's
worst levels in a market still worried about the Middle East
and swayed by a weak opening on Wall Street.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 selected issues fell 266.43
points to 23811.91.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index skidded another 314.03
points to close the morning session at 23497.88, its lowest
level this year.
   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
380 million shares, off slightly from 397.5 million shares
Wednesday.
   Decliners widely outpaced advancers 702 to 252, while 133
issues were unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section dropped 14.05 points, or 0.76%, to 1846.03.
   The second section index fell 54.21 points, or 1.48%, to
3613.35. Volume in the section was estimated at 5.4 million
shares, compared with 5.9 million shares Wednesday.
   Stocks opened on a firmer note, based on a technical
rebound from the Nikkei's past three days of losses, traders
said.
   But reports about a U.S. citizen being shot and injured in
Kuwait City by an Iraqi soldier while trying to avoid capture
ignited selling on the futures indexes.
   Although cash stocks were slower to slide, prices began to
follow futures lower. As the bond market began to stabilize
late in the morning, however, traders began to write off the
report as not signaling imminent war and eased selling
pressure.
   Throughout the day, traces of incentive-backed buying and
further speculative interest mainly by individuals and
dealers gave support to the market, traders said. But
profit-taking checked gains.
   Particularly during the afternoon session, steady
arbitrage selling by major foreign and domestic brokerage
houses brought the Nikkei down about 450 points on the day.
   But toward the end of the session, at least one of the Big
Four Japanese securities firms was enthusiastically buying
both cash and futures, sources said, in an attempt to support
the market and entice investors into believing that prices
were near bottoms.
   The Nikkei index has now fallen 2166.46 points, or 8.34%,
since last Friday, traders noted.
   But on the other hand, the market is still overvalued when
considering price-earnings ratios, while the volatile,
shortterm nature of the market hasn't changed, noted traders
including Kevin Haag at Nomura Securities.
   "The thing we don't need right now are rumors upsetting a
very nervous market already upset for domestic reasons,"
added Brian Tobin, deputy general manager of Japanese equity
sales at S.G. Warburg Securities (Japan).
   Warburg is looking at a realistic bottom for the Nikkei
somewhere from 20000 points to 23000 points, Mr. Tobin said.
He added that "any sort of retreat below 23000 points will be
a managed and organized retreat."
   "The low volume attests to the fact that shares are not
being dumped. The strategic institutional investor is sitting
back, waiting for things to fall in line," Mr. Tobin said.
   In the meantime, the Nikkei apparently has found
short-term, psychological support at 23500 points, as
intraday lows over the past three weeks haven't yet fallen
below 23547 points, posted Aug. 24, traders said. Thursday's
intraday low was at 23620 points.
   Higher Thursday were incentive-backed or speculative
shares such as Sumitomo Metal Mining, up 200 yen to 1570 yen
(up $1.41 to $11.09). The company said Wednesday that it had
discovered a gold mine in Japan.
   Also sharing the spotlight were Mitsui Mining, up 25 yen
to 960 yen, and Dowa Mining, up 99 yen to 769 yen.
   Nippon Light Metal was fueled by brokerage house buying
interest, traders said. It closed at 1310 yen, up 80 yen.
   Kurabo rose 130 yen to 1,850 yen.
   High-technology, blue-chip shares were lower. Sony fell
140 yen to 6950 yen, Pioneer dropped 140 yen to 4760 yen, TDK
dropped 230 yen to 5460 yen, and Kyocera tumbled 310 yen to
7090 yen.
   In London, although there was scattered buying, the
support was far from enough to satisfy the needs of market
makers who cut prices in hopes of drawing interest. Late in
the day, losses in New York added to the bearish mood.
   "If Wall Street closes lower it will trigger the Japanese
market and we'll be on a merry-go-round," one trader said.
   An announcement by the Bank of England that it wouldn't
alter U.K. interest rates for seven days created uncertainty
in the money markets, one trader said. With doubts cast on
the possibility of an imminent interest-rate cut, fears of
recession have been revived and stocks lost yet another
reason to recover, he said.
   "Downgradings of any recession-sensitive stocks are
prompting a large amount of selling," another trader said.
"Stockbrokers are selling very hard indeed," he added.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index dropped
31.3 points to 2120.9, which was the day's low. The Financial
Times 30 Share Index closed down 32.3 points at 1639.9.
Volume was inflated to 515.5 million shares by a 64 million
share placing in Asda PLC. The stock fell 3 1/2 pence to 109
pence (7 cents to $2.08).
   Among a host of companies reporting earnings, Reckitt &amp;
Colman posted a 15% rise in pretax profit on strong
continental European and Latin American earnings, prompting a
20 pence rise to #11.59.
   Oil company results were in line with market expectations.
Burmah Oil net gained 3.7%, reflecting increased profit in
lubricants and fuels. Nevertheless, the share price dropped 9
pence to 506 pence as the company's big downstream exposure
continued to worry investors.
   At Enterprise Oil, an oil producer, pretax profit soared
59% because of a successful drilling program and higher
interest income. The stock gained 2 pence to 680 pence.
   Meanwhile, other European markets closed marginally lower.
South African gold stocks ended slightly higher.
   And stocks closed lower in Singapore, Taipei, Seoul and
Wellington, were mixed in Hong Kong and Manila, and higher in
Sydney.

   Toro Co., Minneapolis, said it expects to post a "small
loss" for its first quarter ending Oct. 26, citing an
anticipated decline in sales of snow throwers.
   In the year-earlier fiscal first quarter, the maker of
outdoor maintenance and irrigation equipment earned $2.6
million, or 24 cents a share, on sales of $137 million.

   The company also said it expects that per-share earnings
for fiscal 1991 will be in the range of $2.20 to $2.40,
compared with year-earlier profit of $16.6 million, or $1.55
a share. Toro said Lawn-Boy Inc., the lawn-mower maker it
acquired last year from Outboard Marine Corp., should show a
profit in fiscal 1991, reversing a substantial loss that
reduced fiscal 1990 earnings.

   Iraq's Problem-Plagued Military
   Is Facing a Formidable Foe: Time

   BAGHDAD -- Iraq's military machine already is creaking,
because of supply problems, low morale and purges of
high-ranking officers. Nevertheless, nothing short of all-out
war is likely to dislodge Iraq's army from its position in
Kuwait, according to military analysts in Baghdad.
   However, East and West bloc analysts say time is on the
side of Iraq's enemies. Baghdad's problems are expected to
worsen significantly over the next six to nine months. "There
is no quick fix that will push Iraq out of Kuwait," says one
Western military attache.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On paper, Iraq's military is so formidable as to make any
attack almost unthinkable. Its one million troops, 4,000
tanks, 500 combat aircraft and 1,200 missiles make up the
third- or fourth-largest military force in the world,
analysts here say. Most equipment is of comparable quality to
that of a European country, such as France.
   But Iraq's ability to maintain its forces in the absence
of foreign equipment and expertise is questionable. Iraq can
produce ammunition and some basic components, but it relies
on imported spare parts for almost all its sophisticated
weaponry. Many of its combat aircraft still are serviced by
Soviets in Iraq, and sometimes are flown back to the U.S.S.R.
for major maintenance. The Soviets say they still have 160
"specialists" under contract in Iraq to service Soviet
equipment and train Iraqis to use it.
   Analysts believe that if Iraq continues in its current
defensive posture, 30% of its materiel could be out of
operation in nine months. Any fighting or major redeployment
would cause much more rapid deterioration; at best, Iraq
could sustain a defensive war for no more than two months,
and an offensive for one or two weeks, analysts say.
   Iraq's other problems are harder to quantify. Getting
water to troops in Kuwait already is a major problem, and
food supplies are uneven as well. Dysentery is rampant in
Kuwait and southern Iraq, and there have reportedly been
cases of cholera in Kuwait.
   Morale and discipline also appear to be poor. As evidence,
analysts point to the looting of Kuwait, and two incidents
over the past year when rioting troops -- possibly members of
a Shiite Muslim cell within the Army -- led to shootings and
deaths in Baghdad. Desertion, a serious problem during the
Iran-Iraq war, also has resumed though there are no reliable
figures on the numbers who have fled into Iran, Saudi Arabia
or the southern marshes of Iraq, where many have become
highwaymen.
   Only the 140,000 "Republican guards" -- half deployed in
Baghdad and half in the Kuwaiti theater -- are regarded as a
completely reliable fighting force.
   There also are strong signs of dissension within the upper
ranks of the military. The commander of the air force and the
commander of army aviation have vanished from public view in
recent weeks, presumably because they opposed the invasion of
Kuwait. A half-dozen other high-level officers are believed
to have been jailed. "Normally," says one Western analyst,
"you don't change horses in the middle of a race."
   Continued resistance in Kuwait may be further eroding
Iraqi morale. By some estimates, 20 to 25 soldiers a day are
being treated for wounds caused by sniping and Molotov
cocktails -- usually aimed at officers. Analysts say they
have reliable reports of women driving through the streets of
Kuwait and hurling grenades out the windows. Five hundred or
more Iraqis may have been killed or wounded since the
invasion Aug. 2, they say.
   As yet, another potential problem for the Iraqi military
hasn't emerged: the Kurds. Soon after the cease-fire in its
war with Iran, Iraq turned its guns and chemical weapons on
the Kurds, who have been fighting a guerrilla war in the
north for decades. The Iraqi action decimated the Kurdish
resistance. But the north remains tense and heavily armed;
with help from foreign-supported Kurds crossing in from
Turkey, Syria or Iran, analysts say, the north could become a
low-level second front. Iraqi anxiety in Kurdistan is evident
in the fact that it retains some 200,000 troops in the north.
   If fighting does break out, analysts in Baghdad believe
heavy ground action is probably unavoidable. While the West
will eventually have massive air superiority, "you don't win
wars by bombing alone," says one analyst. Also, Iraq's
military complex is too dispersed to be destroyed in a first
strike, so there is the risk of retaliatory attacks against
Saudi Arabia and Israel.
   But most analysts in Baghdad believe Iraq's much-feared
missile program is overrated. They say there is no hard
evidence that Iraq can equip its missiles with chemical
warheads. And Iraq's 75 or so missile launchers would quickly
be detected once they started firing, making them vulnerable
to attack after only a few rounds.
   Iraq may have one other hidden weapon, though. Analysts
believe more than 2,000 Palestinian commandos have entered
Iraq for training since the beginning of the year.
Infiltrated into the large Palestinian work force in the Gulf
states, they could become a "fifth column," analysts say,
torching oil fields or sabotaging equipment. A wave of terror
against Western targets across the Middle East also "is a
good probability," he says.

   WASHINGTON -- Second-quarter earnings of U.S. banks fell
24% from last year's record to $5.3 billion, largely because
Northeastern banks set aside $1.9 billion more than a year
earlier for possible loan losses, federal regulators said.
   Real estate loan problems, especially in New England,
remain the biggest drag on the earnings of the nation's
12,500 banks, said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Non-current real estate loans rose by $3.2 billion to $27.7
billion at the end of June from the end of March -- a 52%
annual growth rate. Of that increase, $3.05 billion was at
Northeastern banks. Non-current loans are loans more than 90
days past due.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The real estate problems are also spreading to the
mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions, with delinquent-loan
growth in Maryland, the District of Columbia, Virginia and
North Carolina among the biggest in the country.
   But the signs of weakness that were seen the past few
quarters in the Midwest and West have faded somewhat, as such
states as California, Oregon, Utah, Kansas and Iowa
registered decreases in overdue loans. And the FDIC said it
saw signs of recovery in the Southwest, as banks there
recorded their first back-to-back profitable quarters since
1985.
   "At this point, the West is clearly looking strong," said
FDIC Chairman William Seidman. However, he said, "The
Northeast is getting worse everywhere other than
Massachusetts. Massachusetts was leading the {downward}
charge, and things appear to have leveled off there, but the
rest of New England, unfortunately, is doing its best to
catch up."
   Mr. Seidman said the outlook for bank earnings for the
rest of the year is unclear because of the potential economic
effects of the turmoil in the Middle East and mounting signs
of a recession. He said the best that could be expected would
be results similar to the second quarter, with earnings
remaining below record levels.
   The FDIC chief said the results didn't prompt him to
revise his estimate that the agency could have a loss as
large as $2 billion this year from covering insured deposits
in failed banks. However, the number of institutions on the
FDIC's list of "problem banks" stood at 1,014 at the end of
June, the lowest level since 1985.
   As in recent quarters, banks continued to pour billions
more into real estate loans despite that sector's woes. Real
estate loans in the second quarter grew by $82 billion, or
11.6%, to $803 billion from last year's second quarter. That
was the largest increase in any lending category. Real estate
loans remain the biggest single type of bank lending,
accounting for almost 30% of total bank assets.
   However, the mix of real estate lending has changed, with
banks eschewing the commercial real estate and construction
loans that have given them the biggest headaches and focusing
instead on home lending. Almost three-quarters of the $25.5
billion increase in real estate loans since the first quarter
came in residential mortgage and home equity loans. By
contrast, construction and development loans in the second
quarter fell by $823 million from first quarter.
   The key factor restraining earnings in the quarter, the
FDIC said, was banks' provisions of $6.4 billion for loan
losses, compared with $4.4 billion in the second quarter of
1989. Most of the increase came in the Northeast, where banks
set aside $1.9 billion more than a year earlier. Bank
earnings of $7 billion in the second quarter of 1989 set a
record for the second quarter.

   Your Money Matters -- Investment Dartboard:
   Stock Pickers Take Aim to Defy Recession

<LP>
   Damn the recession fears, full speed ahead.
   That seems to be the attitude of several entrants in this
column's stock-picking contest. Generally, they aren't opting
for the usual haven stocks such as food and tobacco. Instead
the entrants are looking for low-priced growth stocks --
shares that they think will show rising earnings but that
aren't too expensive.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I like this kind of environment," says Hugh Johnson,
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "A lot of the
stocks I like that had gotten too pricey now have been kind
of bruised and battered" in the market's decline since
mid-July. For the six months through Aug. 31, the
contestants' only big winner was American Film Technologies
Inc., best known as a colorizer of black-and-white films. The
stock gained 29.8% after Jonathan Steinberg recommended it in
March.
   That gain helped four market professionals eke out a 2.5%
advance for the six months, beating the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which declined 2.3%. The pros also bested a randomly
selected Dartboard Portfolio, chosen by a toss of darts at
the Journal's stock pages. The Dartboard stocks fell more
than 14%. Since the contest adopted its current rules
featuring a six-month measurement period, the pros have
defeated the darts three times in a row.
   Mr. Steinberg, publisher and editor in chief of Individual
Investor magazine in New York, doesn't recommend American
Film Technologies any longer for most investors, although he
thinks it still has some speculative appeal as a takeover
candidate. For the coming six months, he suggests Dell
Computer Corp.
   Based in Austin, Texas, Dell makes personal computers that
are clones of International Business Machine Corp.'s desktop
machines. Dell sells the computers by mail and telephone
solicitation, and has a telephone service staff that Mr.
Steinberg regards highly.
   Mr. Steinberg believes Dell is staging "almost an
unspotted turnaround." Earnings gained almost threefold in
1990's first six months on a 37% sales rise. Wall Street
generally expects Dell to earn about 99 cents a share in the
year ending in January 1991. But Mr. Steinberg thinks $1.15
to $1.20 is realistic.
   A week ago, Dell came out with "a slew of new product
launches and add-ons," Mr. Steinberg says. "They are really
upgrading their product line." At yesterday's closing price
of $11.625, the stock is selling for 10 times Mr. Steinberg's
earnings estimate. He thinks Dell could hit $17 within six
months.
   Mr. Johnson finished second for the past six months, with
a 4.6% gain in Hanson PLC, a big British company active in
such businesses as mining, batteries, cement, tobacco and
chemicals. "It's my kind of stock," he says. Investors who
are willing to tolerate "a snail's pace will get good
returns."
   Mr. Johnson's new pick is Boeing Co., the Seattle airplane
maker, which he says has "successfully made the transition
from mostly defense to mostly commercial aviation." The
company's order backlog is "in excess of $90 billion," or
roughly three times annual sales, he says, and its profit
margins are improving.
   Mr. Johnson thinks he's being "conservative" in estimating
that Boeing's earnings will grow 18% to 20% a year for the
next three years; he predicts profits of about $4 a share
this year and $5 a share next year. With the stock at $47.25,
it is selling for less than 10 times his prediction of 1991
earnings.
   Two new investment professionals join the
stick-your-neck-out brigade this month. Kathleen Millard
manages some $400 million in the Equity Income Fund for
private banking clients of Chase Manhattan Bank. David Katz
is chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors Inc. in
New York.
   Ms. Millard likes Baxter International Inc., a hospital
supply company in Deerfield, Ill. Compared with rivals
Johnson &amp; Johnson and Abbott Laboratories, Baxter's earnings
have lagged in the past few years. "The company basically got
too fat" after it acquired American Hospital Supply, Ms.
Millard says.
   But in March Baxter announced a restructuring program that
will close a fifth of the company's 100 plants world-wide,
cut 10% of its work force, and shed some marginal businesses.
Right now, Baxter earns a return of about 10% to 12% on
stockholders' equity, Ms. Millard says. She believes it can
improve that performance by about one percentage point a year
until Baxter achieves the 15% to 17% returns its major rivals
earn.
   Meanwhile, Baxter sells for less than 14 times estimated
1990 earnings, while Johnson &amp; Johnson and Abbott have been
selling at a multiple of more than 17. Ms. Millard would pay
as much as $26 a share for Baxter, which closed at $23.50
yesterday. Her target is $32 to $36 within a year.
   Mr. Katz favors Handleman Co., a distributor and
wholesaler of home entertainment products such as videotapes,
audio tapes and compact disks. It specializes in serving
large retailers such as K mart.
   "The stock is very emotional. Either people love it or
they hate it," says Mr. Katz. Right now they're closer to
hating it. By several measures (such as the stock's price
relative to earnings, and the price relative to book value),
"you are catching it at its historic lows" for the past eight
years, Mr. Katz says. "You are able to buy a dominant player
in a growth industry at an excellent price. The market
absolutely holds in disdain any company with uncertainty."
   One reason for the bargain: earnings in fiscal 1990 (ended
in April) declined to $1.13 a share, from $1.28 a share the
year before. Returns of some videotapes (including "Batman"
movies) were higher than expected, and the company was left
holding some uncollected debts when Ames Department Stores
got into financial trouble.
   But Mr. Katz expects Handleman to bounce back and earn
$1.30 to $1.35 a share this fiscal year. The stock closed
yesterday at $11.25. Says Mr. Katz: "We are buyers up to
about $13."
   For the next six months, the pros' selections will compete
against a Dartboard Portfolio consisting of AmBase Corp.,
Chili's Inc., Coachmen Industries Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd.

million in the year-earlier period, comfortably within market
expectations which ranged between #110 million to #115
million.

   Saudis Pledge `Billions of Dollars' to U.S.
   And Others to Offset Cost of Gulf Crisis

   JIDDAH -- Saudi Arabia's King Fahd pledged to pay
"billions of dollars" to help cover the bill for the
world-wide effort to defend Saudi Arabia and force Iraq out
of Kuwait.
   According to U.S. and Saudi officials, the oil kingdom
told an American delegation led by Secretary of State James
Baker that it will devote much of the enormous oil-price
windfall it has received since Iraq invaded Kuwait to
offsetting the costs of the Persian Gulf crisis to the U.S.
and other nations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There was a meeting of the minds," a Saudi official said.
"The {U.S.} administration will not be disappointed in what
Saudi Arabia is willing to do." A U.S. official described the
Saudi offer as "a very, very substantial commitment."
   Neither country's officials would put a figure on the
agreement, but U.S. officials have generally confirmed
reports that the Bush administration had been hoping the
Saudis would supply about $4 billion over the next year to
poor countries hurt by the embargo and about $500 million
monthly toward meeting the added U.S. defense costs resulting
from the Gulf crisis. The Pentagon expects the Gulf operation
to cost it an extra $6 billion through 1990.
   The U.S. officials also said several smaller Gulf states
have agreed to contribute funds as well. Administration
officials said they are hoping Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates together will cover most of the
Pentagon's extra costs for the Gulf operation through 1990.
   Mr. Baker will visit with leaders of Kuwait and the UAE
today as part of a 10-day trip to countries in the Persian
Gulf region and northern Europe. Besides seeking financial
commitments to pay for the anti-Iraq effort, he is working to
build further diplomatic momentum for the drive. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady is leading a similar mission to a
separate list of countries.
   As part of its drive, the U.S. is asking European
Community nations to contribute as much as $2.5 billion. EC
foreign ministers, meeting in Rome tomorrow, are expected
tentatively to approve aid to poorer nations in the region,
but it's less certain they will contribute cash to defray the
costs of the U.S. military deployment.
   The Saudi contributions to the anti-Iraq effort will go
into two separate funds. One will provide aid to poor Moslem
countries -- especially Egypt, Turkey and Jordan -- which are
suffering from the world-wide embargo of Iraq. The second
will be used to provide monthly payments to the U.S., in cash
or in kind, to help underwrite the U.S. troop deployment
here.
   American officials said King Fahd made explicit an earlier
promise to cover all of the costs incurred by the U.S. for
stationing the massive force on Saudi territory. Among the
items to be covered would be fuel, transport and water. In
addition, the Saudis may cover other costs, and may make
transfers to the U.S. Treasury, according to U.S. officials.
They aren't expected to cover the initial costs of organizing
the deployment, though.
   The Saudis could use a variety of mechanisms other than
direct payments to reimburse the U.S. For example, U.S.
officials said the Saudis might pay other U.S. financial
commitments to offset the military spending. But the
officials wouldn't elaborate and insisted such details remain
to be decided.
   Administration economic officials traveling with Mr. Baker
carried detailed estimates of Saudi oil revenue, which one
official characterized as "a very big number." Assuming
average prices have risen about $10 a barrel since Iraq
invaded Kuwait, Saudi Arabia would be taking in $50 million
or more in added daily revenue on its pre-existing
production, not counting the extra two million barrels a day
it has promised to pump. That tops the cost of the U.S.
military operation here.
   U.S. officials said the financial agreement took up only a
small portion of Mr. Baker's meeting with King Fahd and two
companion sessions with the Saudi foreign minister, Prince
Saud al-Faisal Al Saud.
   The Americans said that Saudi leaders are interested in
exploring the nascent U.S. idea for a regional security
system in the Persian Gulf. And they said the Saudis reported
a decided swing in Arab public opinion against Iraq. The
officials said that no new anti-Iraq measures were planned
during the meeting, and that Saudi Arabia sought no new
commitments from the U.S.

   Market Pulp Output
   By Canadian Mills
   Declined 10% in July

   MONTREAL -- Canadian production of market pulp in July
dropped 10% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at
87% of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 566,000 metric tons of
market pulp in July, compared with 629,000 metric tons a year
earlier. A metric ton equals about 2,204.62 pounds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The July operating rate was up from 80% in June but down
from 99% a year earlier.
   For this year through July, Canadian mills produced
3,818,000 metric tons of market pulp, down 9.2% from
4,207,000 metric tons a year earlier. For the first seven
months, the industry operated at 86% of capacity, down from
97% a year earlier.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp.
   Total market shipments in July dropped 14% to 441,000
metric tons from 513,000 tons a year earlier. Shipments to
all markets were down.
   Market shipments for the first seven months also fell 14%
to 3,479,000 metric tons from 4,062,000 tons a year earlier.
   Canadian producer inventories at the end of July totaled
698,000 metric tons, a 44-day supply, which was up from
573,000 metric tons, a 35-day supply, at the end of June, and
from 384,000 tons, or a 20-day supply, at the end of July
1989.

   Many computer makers are increasingly exasperated with
chip maker Motorola Inc.
   Motorola wowed the industry in early 1989 with a new
microprocessor called the 68040, only to hold up mass
production of the chip repeatedly because of design flaws.
Motorola now pledges to start shipping the part in quantity
in October, computer makers say, as much as nine months later
than it first promised.

<TEXT>
   Even if the chip maker meets its latest deadline, the
snafu already has forced the computer makers that rely on
Motorola to delay significantly the introduction of their
next generation of machines. In the industry's fast-paced
game of leapfrog, with computer makers regularly outdoing
each other, such delays can spell big losses in market share.
   The delay's biggest casualty is Hewlett-Packard Palo Alto,
Calif., a loyal Motorola customer that planned to use the
68040 as the "brain" in more than half of its workstations by
year end. HP has watched its market share slide -- blaming,
in part, the elusive Motorola chip. "If we had the 040 today,
we would probably be stronger in the workstation business,"
says Douglas Johnson, product-marketing manager for HP's
Motorola-based computers.
   The tardy chip also may delay the shipment of a new
machine by Next Inc., the Redwood City, Calif., workstation
start-up founded by Steven P. Jobs. And smaller computer
makers say they have delayed machines by as much as a year
because of the belated chip.
   To understand the overdue chip's impact, imagine General
Motors Corp. facing a nine-month delay in getting engines for
its new-model autos while rivals sell their new cars as fast
as they can. Motorola's computer-company customers lack the
"engines," the 68040 chips, that they need to control the
machines they were ready to build as early as January. While
they wait, they must watch competitors grab markets using
rival chips, including Intel Corp.'s top-of-the-line 80486
microprocessor and Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Sparc chip.
   Motorola stands to lose market share, too, though it
garners only a small fraction of its revenue from
microprocessor sales. As Motorola is fine-tuning its 68040,
Intel is expected to sell 230,000 of its 80486 chip this year
and 880,000 in 1991, according to market researcher In-Stat
Inc. Motorola, Schaumburg, Ill., already is a distant second
to Intel, Santa Clara, Calif., in chip sales, partly because
it didn't win wide acceptance for earlier chips in its 68000
family.
   Moreover, Motorola's foray into a popular new technology,
called reduced instruction-set computing (RISC), is running a
distant third behind RISC chips designed by Sun, Mountain
View, Calif., and Mips Computer Systems Inc., Sunnyvale,
Calif.
   "The 040 fiasco certainly hurts Motorola's credibility,"
says analyst Robert Herwick at Hambrecht &amp; Quist. "Most of
the market has already thrown the 68000 {series} into the
ground. This is the last dirt on the coffin."
   Motorola's stock hasn't been doing well, either. It took a
terrible beating yesterday, after analyst James Barlage of
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. reduced his recommendation
on the stock to "avoid" because of lower electronics-industry
growth expectations. The shares closed at $61.50, down
$7.625, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. With
almost 2.3 million shares changing hands, it was the most
active stock on the Big Board.
   Not everyone is so concerned. Apple Computer Inc.,
Cupertino, Calif., a longtime user of Motorola chips, says
there haven't been any adverse effects so far on its plans to
develop a 68040-based Macintosh. HP says it won't abandon the
68000 family. And most traditional Motorola users praise the
68040 as an excellent design that stalwart "Motorola bigots,"
in industry parlance, will wait for.
   But enemy camps are gaining converts among new customers.
"I don't think there's any question that new buyers are going
to look elsewhere first," says analyst Alice Leeper at
Dataquest Inc., a market-research firm.
   That's what Unisys Corp. found. The company planned to
sell a 68040-based machine this summer, says John Chen, vice
president of the Unix systems division of Unisys, Blue Bell,
Pa. But some customers can't wait any longer, he says, so
Unisys steers them to its Intel-based products.
   "The scary part," Mr. Chen adds, "the real competitor, is
RISC." Sun-based and Mips-based machines are quickly gaining
share in the workstation market. Every month that the new
Motorola chip is delayed means it is less likely to become a
major player. "There's a lot of competition out there, and
Motorola isn't in that competition," says Gary Thomas, vice
president of UniFLEX Computing Ltd., a Chapel Hill, N.C.,
software house that has specialized in Motorola chips but now
plans to write programs for Sun's Sparc chips, too.
   The main culprit in Motorola's lateness is its chip's
complexity. Chip makers are cramming more functions on their
wares to meet computer makers' demands for a faster, cheaper
and smaller set of chips. A single 68040 contains 1.2 million
transistors and combines functions that require as many as 50
chips in most computers, says Jack Browne, director of
marketing for Motorola microprocessors, who calls the delay
"pretty serious but not disastrous."
   Motorola was already late when it unveiled a prototype of
the chip in January that it planned to ship in volume by the
middle of this year. But the early samples it sent out had
scores of bugs. For instance, computer makers say they found
the chips wouldn't work without cooling devices. There were
instructions that didn't work. Some software caused strange
results or froze the chip up completely.
   By late spring, it was clear Motorola wasn't going to meet
its schedule. This summer, Motorola was still sending out
samples with a long "errata sheet," a list of the known flaws
in the chip, says Joseph Ramunni, president of Dallas-based
Mizar Inc., which makes computer boards. "If, in fact, there
are chips that do work, we sure aren't getting them," he
says.
   Bugs are commonplace in early chip versions. Intel's
best-selling 80386 chips were shipped in high volumes with
many bugs, which were later corrected, and Intel's 80486 ran
into well publicized bugs last year. But Motorola's bugs are
showing up when the competition already has viable,
"debugged" options on the market.
   As Motorola's delivery schedule dragged out this summer,
HP hedged its bets by unveiling its new Series 400 computer
line, which uses the older 68030 chip but can be upgraded to
use a 68040. Still, the delay is "having a pretty sizable
impact" on HP, says analyst John Jones of Montgomery
Securities, who adds that the late chip is the biggest factor
in HP's flat revenue in workstations for the last three
quarters. That particularly hurts because HP has been under
increasing pressure in the workstation market. The combined
market share of HP and its Apollo unit fell to 25% last year
from about 49% in 1985, according to International Data Corp.
   But while analysts say HP has the muscle to recover,
start-ups aren't so confident about their future. "We've
literally got all our business depending on getting good
chips from Motorola," says Gene Manno, president of Arix
Corp., a San Jose, Calif., computer company that planned to
ship a 68040-based machine in June. Now Arix can't sell its
computer until at least early 1991, Mr. Manno says, and its
revenues have fallen 10% to 15% below expectations. "I've
really got to have this part," he says. "Our whole future
depends on it."
   Mr. Browne says Motorola is now "on track" and doesn't
foresee more delays. Customers are crossing their fingers.
"Now it's like the question of when's Iraq going to leave
Kuwait," says Ron Stack, sales manager for General Micro
Systems Inc., Montclair, Calif., which planned to sell a
68040 product last January. "Is it ever going to come out or
what?"

   L.A. Gear Says
   Net Fell in Quarter
   Despite Sales Rise

   LOS ANGELES -- Athletic-shoe maker L.A. Gear Inc.,
breaking its recent silence on financial matters, said that
net income in its fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31 was
lower than a year ago, despite a 40% sales rise to about $300
million.
   In the year-earlier quarter, L.A. Gear posted record
profit of $22 million, or $1.21 a share, on sales of $215
million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the announcement apparently didn't contain any
surprises, analysts said they were relieved to get some hard
information. "There hasn't been much guidance on sales trends
during the quarter and estimates have varied dramatically,"
said Alice M. Ruth at Montgomery Securities Inc. in San
Francisco.
   Analysts have slashed their profit and sales forecasts
since L.A. Gear surprised Wall Street with a 36% drop in
second-quarter profit. On June 1, the highflying shares
plunged $8.50, or 22%, on volume of 6.6 million shares after
L.A. Gear indicated that it would have its first quarterly
drop in net income in three years.
   Kevin J. Ventrudo, chief financial officer, said the
company wanted to put out its third-quarter sales figures as
soon as they were available so that "everybody would be
working off the same page of the playbook." L.A. Gear has
been inundated recently with inquiries about sales, he said.
   Gross incoming orders in the quarter reached $240 million,
a 15% increase over the year-ago period, L.A. Gear said. The
gross profit margin is "anticipated to be higher than in the
second quarter" when it was 34.8% "It's too early to tell" by
how much, Mr. Ventrudo said. There won't be any extraordinary
items in the quarter, he added.
   Mr. Ventrudo said he doubted that the announcement would
significantly affect Wall Street forecasts. He said that
analysts' third-quarter sales estimates range from about $290
million to $330 million. For the full fiscal year, per-share
estimates range from about $2.30 to $3.50.
   Gary M. Jacobson, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.,
predicted heavy volume in L.A. Gear's shares today but little
price movement. "Expectations are quite low right now and
this doesn't disappoint those low expectations," he said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
L.A. Gear shares closed down 37.5 cents at $16.50. The sales
figures were released after the close of trading.
   Mr. Jacobson said that earlier this year L.A. Gear "got
caught with too much product" as it began to lose its appeal
with customers. L.A. Gear has had to cut prices on these
older footwear styles, thereby eroding its margins.
   L.A. Gear's newer basketball sneakers and other
"performance" shoes that compete directly with offerings from
Nike Inc. and Reebok International Ltd. haven't caught on
quickly, some analysts said. A new line advertised by singer
Michael Jackson "has been receiving mixed reviews," Mr.
Jacobson said. "The jury is still out," countered Mr.
Ventrudo.

   Financially-troubled Tucson Electric Power Co. said it
plans to ask the Arizona Corporation Commission later this
month for an 18-month surcharge of 2% in addition to a 10% to
12% increase in base electricity rates.
   The Tucson-based utility said it also will ask the
regulatory commission for permission to phase into its rate
base recovery of certain costs related to Unit 2 of the
Springerville Generating Station, which began operations in
June.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The commission previously has indicated that the plant
shouldn't be included in the utility's rate base because the
plant's power capacity isn't needed, a Tucson Electric
spokesman said, adding: "We think it is needed and we are
using some power from it."
   Tucson Electric said its most recent rate increase,
11.85%, went into effect last October. The utility had
requested about a 20% increase. The previous increase was in
October 1983. Tucson Electric serves about 750,000 people in
the Tucson area.

   MADRID -- Banco Hispano Americano said it plans to launch
an industrial investment firm in Spain with Dillon, Read Ltd.
of London and the Rockefeller family investment arm,
Rockefeller &amp; Co.
   The firm will have an initial capital of six billion
pesetas ($61.2 million) and will invest in quoted and
non-quoted Spanish companies, with a view to realizing
capital gains over a three-to-five-year period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Holdings will be evenly divided between Spanish partners,
led by Hispano, and non-Spanish partners, led by Rockefeller.
   Rockefeller will take a 30% stake alongside an undisclosed
non-Spanish partner, while Dillon Read, a unit of Dillon,
Read &amp; Co., will split 20% with another non-Spanish partner.
   On the Spanish side, Hispano will share a 50% holding with
construction firm Ferrovial S.A., family-controlled
investment firm Abengoa S.A. and a possible fourth partner.
   Ferrovial chairman Rafael del Pino and Abengoa chairman
Javier Benjumea are Hispano's two largest individual holders,
with a combined holding of about 6%.
   According to a Dillon Read official in London, the new
company will debut in "a few weeks" and list on the Madrid
stock exchange "in due course." According to this official,
the recent plunge in prices on the Madrid stock exchange
hasn't upset the group's investment plans.
   "It's a very opportune moment to start making
investments," he said. "We find lower prices a plus . . .
we're not dealing with an overheated market any more."
   The new firm's management team has been culled from
investment firm Bestinver, controlled by one of Ferrovial's
principal competitors, Jose-Maria Entrecanales, the owner of
construction firm Entrecanales &amp; Tavora S.A.
   Earlier this year, Entrecanales and Ferrovial were at
loggerheads over Ferrovial's bid to take over a third
construction firm, Cubiertas &amp; Mzov S.A., in which
Entrecanales has a stake. The dispute was finally settled
amicably, with Ferrovial selling the holding which it had
built up in Cubiertas.
   Jose-Ignacio Benjumea, who as Bestinver's managing
director was one of the participants in the Cubiertas
struggle, will run the new company. He will be assisted by
Carlos Prado, formerly Bestinver's industrial specialist, and
Santos MartinezConde, formerly head of Bestinver's research
department. Mr. Benjumea is a nephew of Javier Benjumea, the
Abengoa chairman.

   WASHINGTON -- Democratic and Republican congressional
leaders vowed to present separate $50 billion
deficit-reduction packages as their opening bids in renewed
budget talks today.
   The quickened pace of discussions yesterday was the first
sign in months that the negotiators were serious about
devising a significant budget plan. Another indication will
come today, when President Bush opens the latest round of
talks at Andrews Air Force Base near here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In separate press conferences yesterday, the negotiators
of both parties said they would act in good faith to reach
agreement. Both also reiterated their support for the
previously agreed to goal of cutting the deficit by $50
billion in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, and $500 billion
over five years, even though the economy has weakened further
and the Persian Gulf crisis has spurred energy prices since
they last met a month ago.
   Despite the promises of $50 billion packages, however,
both sides indicated that any final plan probably would fall
short of that. "It's a negotiating position and we're not
going to die for any part of it," Rep. Bill Frenzel (R.,
Minn.) said of the GOP plan. "We'll see where we go from
there."
   Both sides labored throughout the day to complete their
plans, amid continuing divisions within party ranks. Though
lawmakers and aides gave few details, both the Democratic and
Republican plans appeared likely to be split about evenly
between spending cuts and tax increases.
   Late yesterday, congressional Republicans endorsed as
their opening shot a $53 billion fiscal 1991 plan that was
little changed from a proposal prepared by White House Budget
Director Richard Darman in July. Roughly half of the proposed
savings would come from higher revenues and user fees, about
$15 billion from cuts in entitlement programs, notably
Medicare, and a net of about $4 billion from other domestic
programs.
   Both sides appear to support some kind of increases on
"sin" taxes. Democrats were talking about raising excise
taxes on liquor and tobacco, while Republicans will propose
higher taxes on beer and wine only. By omitting tobacco, the
GOP reflected a recent campaign pledge by President Bush in
North Carolina.
   In addition, Democrats were moving toward proposing a
broad tax on energy consumption and adopting their long-held
position to lift the top tax rate on the richest Americans to
33% from 28%.
   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) indicated
Republicans were considering tax incentives for oil
production, a move that would lose revenue. At least some
Democrats also were suggesting a fee on imported oil as a way
of helping domestic production.
   The Republican plan also will apparently propose to expand
tax breaks for individual retirement accounts and limit the
deduction for state and local income tax payments. It also
will propose cutting the capital-gains tax rate, which would
boost revenue in the first year. The Democrats don't intend
to support the capital gains tax, at least initially.
   For defense spending, Republicans will propose about $5
billion in cuts, while Democrats, at least initially,
supported cuts of more than twice that size. Still in
question was the accounting for the costs of stationing U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia, which Mr. Darman has estimated at $3
billion over the next six months.
   Given the Mideast crisis, Republicans feel confident that
defense cuts won't be so great as Democrats would like. But
in turn, Democrats would demand fewer domestic cuts than
Republicans. Since both sides have tentatively agreed to
balance spending cuts and tax increases, any erosion in
spending cuts would reduce proposed new revenues. The result
could be a deficit-trimming package as small as $25 billion.
   Serious questions remain whether any package will emerge
from the weekend meetings, and yesterday's news conferences
seemed designed in part for each side to try to establish its
own good faith should talks collapse.
   "We can't guarantee for you that something's going to
happen," said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D.,
Mo.), who chairs the bipartisan negotiations. But, he added,
the across-the-board spending cuts that threaten after Oct. 1
if Congress and the Bush administration don't reach agreement
"would be a very bad and poor outcome."
   One negotiator, House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R.,
Ga.), said the greater pressure for a solution was on
Democrats, who control Congress. "How would you like the
president to announce that he's able to work with Mubarak,
he's able to work with Gorbachev, he's able to work with all
22 of our allies in the Persian Gulf, but the Congress and
Saddam Hussein are the two groups he doesn't seem to be able
to work with?" Mr. Gingrich asked.
   The difficulties ahead for negotiators were underscored
when Mr. Gingrich used a luncheon speech to restate his
intention to push a package of tax cuts. Though he put the
revenue loss at $18 billion over five years, other estimates
put a cost at $85 billion over that period.
   Mr. Gingrich reiterated his criticism of congressional
Democrats, particularly Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, and his opposition to tax increases. Mr. Mitchell
dismissed the remarks. Alluding to the president's
acknowledgement that revenue increases will be necessary, the
Senate leader said "President Bush has one view and Rep.
Gingrich appears to have another."
   Campaigning in Topeka, Kan., for Republican candidates
yesterday, President Bush avoided the Democrat-bashing that
marked campaign appearances earlier this summer. "The time
for partisanship, in my view, is past, and the time for
avoiding the tough decisions is gone," Mr. Bush said.
Referring to congressional leaders of both parties, he added,
"They're not going to do it {reduce the deficit} exactly the
way I want, and I understand that."

   Charles H. Howard III, former director and first vice
president of defunct Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc., was
indicted by a federal grand jury on conspiracy, obstruction
and perjury charges in connection with a broad Securities and
Exchange Commission investigation of insider trading in New
England thrift stocks.
   Mr. Howard, 45 years old, was once a star performer for
the firm and a key player in the hot market for New England
thrift stocks in the mid-1980s. Thomson McKinnon Securities
filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said the charges are related to the
SEC's 1987 investigation of alleged insider trading in
connection with the public announcement that Suffield Savings
Bank, Suffield, Conn., planned to acquire Coastal Savings
Bank of Portland, Maine.
   The investigation touched off a broad probe of insider
trading in New England bank stocks, and resulted in
additional charges of securities violations by Thomson
McKinnon Securities. The firm paid $320,000 in fines last
year to four New England states to settle charges that Mr.
Howard and others sold securities without licenses.
   The investigations also led to a blizzard of lawsuits and
to the conviction in New Haven of Robert C. DiGennaro,
Suffield's former chairman and chief executive, on insider
trading and other charges.
   According to the indictment of Mr. Howard, announced by
U.S. Attorney Wayne A. Budd in Boston, Mr. Howard conspired
with others to conceal that investors had purchased Coastal
stock prior to the announcement of the merger on the basis of
inside knowledge. The indictment also charges that he tried
to obstruct the SEC's investigation and perjured himself in
testimony before commission investigators.
   Mr. Howard made his name mainly as a financial adviser to
small New England savings banks, many of which converted from
mutual to public ownership in the mid-1980s. During much of
the bull market, New England thrift stocks were star
performers, and Mr. Howard was their most visible and
flamboyant advocate.
   He not only helped the fledgling public companies drum up
interest in their shares, he helped invest the capital they
raised in the public offerings. In many cases, the banks he
advised invested large amounts in each other.
   But things began to sour two years ago, as federal and
state investigators poked into irregular trading in New
England bank stocks and many of the banks sustained steep
portfolio losses.
   Mr. Howard couldn't be reached for comment. But his
attorney, Steven M. Gordon, said Mr. Howard "has known that
he was a target of a federal investigation for a number of
years." He said that Mr. Howard is "in some respects relieved
that he will now be provided with the specifics of the
allegations against him and be permitted to fully contest the
charges." He declined to comment further.

   NEW CHARGES are filed in Combustion Engineering
insider-trading case.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an amended
civil suit making new allegations in the case involving Asea
Brown Boveri Group Ltd.'s takeover last year of Combustion
Engineering. The amended complaint, filed in federal court in
Manhattan, names Christian Norgren, a former director of ABB,
as a defendant and accuses him of tipping off a friend and a
business associate about plans for the $1.6 billion takeover.
   Mr. Norgren, a Swedish citizen living in Liechtenstein,
resigned as a director of ABB, a Swedish-Swiss
power-generation company, last November, a few days after the
initial SEC suit was filed in the case. Mr. Norgren also was
fired as president of Bank in Liechtenstein. He is part owner
of Finacor Anstalt, a Liechtenstein financial-services firm
charged in the SEC suit of making illegal profits of $2.5
million on the alleged insider trading.
   The SEC accused Mr. Norgren of purchasing Combustion
Engineering common stock and call-option contracts through
Finacor just days before the $40-a-share offer was announced
on Nov. 13. In the amended suit, the SEC said Mr. Norgren
recommended the stock to a friend as "the chance of a
lifetime." In the suit, the SEC said that the friend sold the
securities at a small loss the next day after he learned from
Mr. Norgren that the recommendation was based on inside
information. The SEC said the friend warned Mr. Norgren that
trading on such information is illegal in the U.S.
   Mr. Norgren couldn't be reached for comment. Finacor said
the amended complaint "represents an unwarranted effort to
expand the charges in this case." Finacor's attorney, Thomas
E. Engel of New York, said that the SEC had "frustrated"
Finacor's efforts to rescind the trades and has "refused to
consider any reasonable resolution" of the matter.
   In connection with the alleged insider-trading scheme, the
SEC also filed a civil suit yesterday against Howard
Marguleas, a businessman in Rancho Mirage, Calif. Mr.
Marguleas agreed to settle the suit, without admitting or
denying the allegations, by instructing his brokerage house
to turn over to the SEC $229,000, which the SEC said was
illegal profits from the alleged insider trading. The money
was held by the brokerage house after Mr. Marguleas tried to
reverse the transactions.
   The SEC alleged that Mr. Norgren told Mr. Marguleas about
ABB's planned offer during a business meeting in New York on
Nov. 7, 1989. The SEC said in the suit that Mr. Marguleas
agreed to buy the securities on Mr. Norgren's behalf, but
then tried to reverse the transactions after the takeover was
announced.
   Mr. Marguleas said he tried to reverse the transaction
after having second thoughts about its legality. He said he
voluntarily reported the trading to the SEC and that he has
cooperated fully with its investigation. The SEC sought no
fines or injunctions against Mr. Marguleas.

   JUDGE REFUSES TO DISMISS obscenity charges in Mapplethorpe
exhibit case.
   Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center and its director,
Dennis Barrie, previously were indicted on charges of
violating Ohio's obscenity law in April by displaying
sexually graphic photographs in an exhibition of works by the
late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. They sought dismissal
of the charges on grounds the material isn't obscene as
defined under constitutional law.
   But Hamilton County Municipal Judge F. David J. Albanese
rejected the argument, saying it is up to a jury to decide
the obscenity issue. He ordered the defendants to stand trial
Sept. 24, the same day they will be tried on a related
misdemeanor charge stemming from the Mapplethorpe exhibit.
   Judge Albanese also upheld a prosecutors' motion to limit
the evidence in the obscenity case to five photographs
described in the indictment. The defendants had contended
that the five pictures must be considered in the context of
the entire exhibit, which included photographs that weren't
sexually oriented. But Judge Albanese ruled that "each
photograph has a separate identity."
   Marc Mezibov, an attorney in Cincinnati for the
defendants, said, "We're certainly not pleased" with the
ruling.
   He said the judge is expected to issue guidelines
clarifying his opinion and that a decision on whether to
appeal won't be made until then.

   CARPENTERS UNION in New York is sued for alleged ties to
organized crime.
   The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan filed a civil
lawsuit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act accusing the leaders of the carpenters
union of running a protection racket that collected payoffs
from contractors.
   The suit claims that union leaders and organized-crime
families extorted the payments in exchange for guaranteeing
labor peace. The suit, the result of a joint federal, state,
and city investigation, says some contractors were allowed to
get around union work and safety rules in return for the
payoffs.
   The suit asks that an independent trustee be appointed to
run the 30,000 member union, the largest construction union
in New York City.
   "Union members' rights have been systematically traded for
secret payoffs," says the suit, filed in federal court in
Manhattan. "Those who opposed this corrupt state of affairs
-- whether employees or union members -- have been
intimidated into silence by violence, threats, economic
coercion, and the known ties between corrupt union officers
and organized crime."
   The defendants include the governing body of the union,
four union officials and six alleged members of the Genovese
organized-crime family. The suit doesn't specify how much the
union leaders and the mob allegedly received from
contractors.
   A spokesman for the union declined to comment on the
allegations.

   DISTRIBUTOR WINS $6 million in damages in a vertical
price-fixing verdict.
   A federal jury in Atlanta awarded $2 million in damages,
to be trebled under antitrust law, to DeLong Equipment Co.,
an Atlanta distributor of metal-polishing agents, in a
price-fixing case. DeLong alleged that it was terminated as a
distributor of a polishing agent made by Washington Mills
Abrasive Co., North Grafton, Mass., because DeLong wouldn't
join in a scheme to fix the price of the material sold to the
Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft division of United Technologies
Corp. Pratt &amp; Whitney used the material in making jet-engine
parts for the U.S. military and others.
   DeLong alleged that Washington Mills relabeled generic
polishing material as "special" and doubled its price.
   An attorney for Washington Mills said the company will ask
the judge to set aside the jury verdict.

   Skis Rossignol
   Plans to Acquire
   U.S. Golf Concern

   PARIS -- Skis Rossignol S.A., plagued by mounting losses
after three winters of poor snow conditions, plans to buy a
U.S. golf company in an effort to pull itself out of the red
through greater diversification.
   Rossignol General Manager Jean-Jacques Bompard said in an
interview that the company hopes to present to the annual
meeting Sept. 19 a finalized agreement to buy a small but
aggressive U.S. golf concern for about 100 million francs
($19.1 million) to balance its ski-based product line.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He said the unidentified target isn't yet a major player
in the U.S. golf market, but that Rossignol thinks its
technical and marketing acumen can propel it into the big
leagues. "The talks are well under way. I expect a decision
in the next 10 days," said Mr. Bompard, noting that Rossignol
was attracted to the company because of its "very competitive
line of high-quality equipment."
   This would represent an initial step by the world's
leading ski maker to face up to anticipated losses of 85
million francs for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1991,
following a 9.3 million franc deficit in fiscal 1990.
Revenue, meanwhile, is expected to slip to 1.39 billion
francs in fiscal 1991 from 1.47 billion francs a year
earlier.
   A lack of snow in the Alps and the western U.S. for three
consecutive seasons, combined with the French franc's recent
strength against the yen and the dollar, has caused most of
the damage.
   Grenoble-based Rossignol has begun a three-year, 100
million-franc modernization program at two main ski factories
to try to cut costs and improve quality. The plants have
combined annual production capacity of one million pairs of
skis.
   Mr. Bompard said both programs will be self-financed,
drawing in part on resources derived from a 100 million franc
capital boost in November 1989 that helped reduced the
group's debt-to-capital ratio to 47.5% from 95% two years
ago.
   However, doubts about Rossignol remain in the French
investment community. Stock analysts aren't confident about
management's plans to expand summer-sports activities beyond
the minor tennis operations that currently account for about
6% of revenue.
   Rossignol has made tennis rackets that carry its name
since 1977 and sells an average 350,000 rackets a year, well
below sales of leading brands Dunlop, Kennex, Prince, Wilson
and Head.
   Analysts question to what extent the company's balance
sheet will benefit, citing the example of sporting goods
counterpart Salomon S.A., which gets 28% of its revenue from
its Taylor-Made golf operations. Salomon had a loss of 91
million francs in the fiscal year ended March 31, prompting
work force cutbacks scheduled to start this month. Even
though golf sales grew 45% in the quarter ended June 30, its
total revenue was off 26%.
   But golf or no golf, analysts say, Rossignol will remain
hostage to the foreign-exchange market. As long as the franc
holds firm, sales figures will suffer.

   Retailers Post Only Modest Sales Gains
   For August; Tougher Seasons Expected

   The nation's big retailers reported modest sales gains for
August, but disappointing sales on home furnishings and early
fall merchandise foreshadow a difficult fall and winter
season, analysts agreed.
   The August gains at stores open for at least a year ranged
from 1.6% to 14% and were somewhat lower than analysts'
expectations. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.'s retail index of 21
retailers showed average gains of about 5.1%; Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons' weighted index of 13 major retail stores showed August
sales gains averaged about 4.8%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Times are tough, and this is a bad omen for the second
half of the year," said Robert Buchanan of Alex. Brown.
   "Generally the numbers came in pretty weak, a little worse
than what we were looking for," said Margo McGlade, a retail
analyst at PaineWebber Inc. She estimated that sales gains at
the major retailers were flat on a seasonally adjusted basis.
   "I believe that if we aren't in a recession already we are
close to it," said Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd. He added: "The number of retailers
reporting on or ahead of plan is diminishing, and judging by
history and experience, we think that this is going to affect
everybody."
   Last month, Mr. Edelman and other retail analysts lowered
their earnings estimates for retailers. "And I know that we
will move lower before we are finished," he said.
   The lackluster August results sent a shock wave across the
market as retail industry stocks tumbled yesterday. Limited
Inc. closed at $15.625, off $1.125, on volume of almost two
million shares. J.C. Penney fell $1 to $45.875. Gap declined
$1.875 to $53.125 and Dayton Hudson dropped $1 to $57.25.
Wal-Mart fell 87.5 cents to $27.50 and Nordstrom slipped 75
cents to $21.75.
   Analysts were surprised by the August results at
Columbus-based Limited, where sales at stores open at least a
year rose only 1%. Analysts estimated that same-store sales
of three of Limited's principal divisions fell, including the
giant Limited Stores division, where analysts estimated
same-store sales fell 3% in August.
   Analysts also were disappointed by August sales at J.C.
Penney where same-store sales fell 2.4%. Penney's attributed
the decline to "exceptionally strong performance of the prior
year's period," and told analysts that furniture sales fell
more than 20% in August compared with a year earlier.
   Alex. Brown's Mr. Buchanan said: "Penney's is trying to
move up in quality and price points in a difficult economic
environment. It is hard to take away market share when their
{department store} competitors are becoming very
promotional."
   Analysts believe that retailers are starting to brace
themselves for a tough fall season. On Wednesday, retail
analysts visiting a new Paramus, N.J., Nordstrom store said
co-chairman Bruce Nordstrom told them he expects modest sales
for the remainder of the year and is making plans to cut
expenses and inventory levels at the Seattle-based
department-store chain.
   A Nordstrom spokesman confirmed that the store plans "some
across-the-board operating expense cutbacks" in the range of
3% to 12% for the rest of the year. "We anticipate at least
part of that will be personnel layoffs and inventory
cutbacks," the spokesman said.
   At Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., the nation's
largest retailer, same-store sales grew 4.1% in August, while
at Troy, Mich.-based K mart, the nation's second-largest
retailer, same-store sales gained 1.6%.
   A few retailers reported stronger August results.
Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., reported same-store
gains of 13%; San Francisco-based Gap Inc. said same-store
gains climbed 14%; and sales at Dayton Hudson in Minneapolis
grew 8% from a year earlier.
   But despite some bright spots, analysts believe the retail
sales climate is deteriorating across the country. Thomas
Tashjian of Seidler Amdec Securities noted that retail sales
are now softening in the Pacific Northwest, Southern
California and Texas, regions where sales had been stronger
than in the economically depressed Northeast.
   Adds PaineWebber's Ms. McGlade: "The picture may be even
dimmer than the major retailers' sales results suggest. The
public companies that report sales tend to be larger,
high-quality companies that are taking market share, so the
small mom-and-pops and the independent chains could be
suffering more than the big stores."

   WASHINGTON -- As soon as President Bush returned from his
vacation in Maine this week, he assembled his cabinet and
gave a brief report on the confrontation with Iraq. Then he
turned to the major business of the day: demanding that his
cabinet members switch their attention from the Persian Gulf
to the economic problems here at home.
   Moans and groans -- literally -- went up around the
cabinet room.

<TEXT>
   Budget director Richard Darman described how the Gulf
crisis was rapidly adding billions to the nation's yawning
budget deficit. Economic adviser Michael Boskin described the
billions in growth that the crisis was shaving from the
already-anemic economy. "There weren't a lot of pleasant
surprises," says an official who attended the meeting.
   Today, the crunch will hit President Bush even harder. For
the past month, he has had something of a free ride. Congress
was on vacation. Domestic policy was on hold. Public support
surged on a wave of patriotism. But this morning,
unemployment figures will offer the first glimpse of the
economy's condition in the wake of the Mideast blowup. And
budget negotiators returning to the bargaining table will
find themselves more divided than ever as the Iraq crisis
complicates their task of cutting the deficit.
   Mr. Bush's aggressive Persian Gulf policy and the economic
mess are about to collide head-on. How he handles these
problems in the next several weeks will help determine
whether the U.S. has the resources and the will to support
its global superpower role.
   Difficult as the Iraq situation is, the problems at home
may be even more daunting. "The foreign policy area is easier
to solve, in my view, than the domestic," says Donald Regan,
the former Treasury secretary and White House chief of staff.
"The domestic economic problems are a terrible bag of worms."
   Consider:
   -- A new internal White House analysis suggests that the
Middle East crisis could push the nation's budget deficit
over the $250 billion mark next year. And that estimate may
be conservative; Rudolph Penner, an economist at the Urban
Institute who once headed the Congressional Budget Office,
thinks a tough recession could send it closer to $400
billion. Mr. Bush will personally meet with the congressional
negotiators in this morning's round of budget talks. But even
his own advisers are split over whether to be confrontational
or accommodating with Democrats in the quest for a
deficit-cutting agreement, say administration sources.
   -- America's foreign-aid budget, which already appeared
deficient for the changing world of the '90s, looks
thoroughly inadequate in light of new demands from the
Mideast showdown. The U.S. now faces multibillion-dollar
requests from its allies in the region, as well as continuing
pressure to help Eastern Europe, Latin America, and possibly
even a struggling Soviet Union.
   -- Rising oil prices continue pushing the U.S. economy
toward recession at a time when unprecedented corporate debt
and a weak financial system may make recession far more
perilous than usual. And faced with the ballooning budget
deficit, the president is virtually powerless to use federal
spending or tax policy to stimulate the economy.
   The president -- and the nation -- have much at stake.
With the Soviets facing even worse economic problems, the
U.S. has shown in the last few weeks it is the only nation
still capable of acting as a superpower in the current
crisis. But now, as Mr. Bush prepares to meet Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev this weekend, he also must show that
America can get its domestic house in order.
   "We tend to think of these things as a domestic quarrel in
a family," says Bobby Inman, a former deputy director of
Central Intelligence. "But in fact, the whole world is
watching."
   Unless Mr. Bush can score surprising success in breaking
the economic-policy deadlock, the result could be a new world
order in which the U.S. assumes the traditional superpower
role in political and military leadership, but must rely on
financial help from its friends around the world.
   Already the costs of the Mideast crisis are forcing
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Secretary of State
James Baker to trek hat-in-hand across Europe and Asia
seeking help in paying for the military operation and in
aiding key allies such as Egypt and Turkey -- "an
international United Way campaign," Indiana Sen. Richard
Lugar calls it.
   Bush aides say they hope the crisis will pull together the
White House and Congress in a new resolve to quit bickering
and address budget and economic problems. But for that to
happen, the president would have to convince Congress and the
public that sacrifices are necessary, in the form of big
domestic spending cuts or tax increases.
   Will the nation emerge from the Gulf crisis with anything
more than a bigger budget deficit? "It depends on whether we
can get the administration to finally deliver bad news to the
American public, as well as good," maintains Rep. David Obey,
a Wisconsin Democrat who heads the appropriations
subcommittee that handles foreign aid.
   Like the vacationing Congress, the American public has,
for a while, given the president plenty of running room to
deal with Saddam Hussein. "This has been a short-term
political plus," says Stuart Eizenstat, who was President
Carter's domestic policy adviser. "It has boosted the
president's popularity and taken people's minds off Neil Bush
and the savings and loans and a declining economy."
   But eventually, he and others agree, the problems closer
to home will overtake the fervent support of U.S. policy in
the Mideast. "The American people have a very short attention
span," Mr. Eizenstat says. "If there's a standoff, attention
will begin to shift" to the domestic quandary.
   And the domestic problems will have been made all the
worse by the Gulf confrontation. Here is a look at these
problems, and how they may play out over the coming weeks:
                                                                                                       

   Budget Deficit
                                                                                                       

   When President Bush came into office last year, he vowed
to address the deficit. "We will not have the luxury of
taking the easy, spendthrift approach to solving problems,"
he said in a televised speech. But now, owing in part to the
Gulf crisis, he appears headed for deficits dwarfing even the
leviathan ones of the Reagan years.
   The direct costs of the military operation are only a
small part of the problem. Those costs, the Pentagon says,
are running about $30 million a day, and congressional budget
officials estimate the cost in the fiscal year beginning Oct.
1 at $6 billion to $8 billion.
   More troublesome are the effects on the deficit of
oil-induced economic slowing. "The prospect of going into a
recession with a $200 billion deficit is phantasmagoric,"
says Mr. Eizenstat. "We would come out of the recession with
a deficit so huge that it would stymie the ability of
lawmakers to do anything about it."
   Though White House and congressional budget negotiators
resume talks today, the Iraq crisis will make reaching a
consensus far more difficult. Mr. Darman argues that a $50
billion deficit cut next year (the official target) is more
important than ever before. Others, however, say such a big
package could cause further damage to the economy. Some
members of Congress expect a more modest package of only $20
billion to $35 billion in spending cuts and tax increases.
And House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia has launched a
campaign for tax cuts, to stimulate the sagging economy.
   Some analysts have talked of a special tax increase to pay
for the Gulf deployment, but such a tax would be a recipe for
shattering the Republicans' coalition on national security.
Some prominent GOP conservatives have been arguing that the
U.S. should stay out of the fight over Kuwait. Those same
conservatives are the party's most virulent opponents of new
taxes; they would be especially agitated over a special
Persian Gulf tax.
   The president will have to wage a mighty battle to wring
out a meaningful budget agreement. But, notes Mr. Eizenstat,
"the time and energy the administration can devote to
economic and budgetary issues right now has got to be
limited."
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Aid
                                                                                                       

   Without some radical change, Mr. Bush simply won't be able
to find enough money to help all the countries that seemingly
deserve American help now.
   His first move to aid Mideast allies came this week, when
the president asked Congress to forgive some $7 billion in
military debts owed by Egypt. That move has built up
expectations of help for others that probably will have to be
dashed.
   Turkey, which has played a critical role by shutting an
Iraqi oil pipeline, has $1.25 billion in military debts to
the U.S. that it too may want forgiven. Israel, which the
U.S. considers its most reliable Mideast ally, quickly
signaled that it wants its $4.5 billion in military and
civilian debts forgiven as well. Israel plans to seek
hundreds of millions of dollars of additional military
assistance as well, to confront the Iraqi military threat.
   And the administration already was having trouble scraping
up money to help emerging democracies in Eastern Europe and
Latin America. Six weeks ago, many in Congress thought the
defense budget could be robbed for cash to spread around to
them, cementing in place a more stable post-Cold War world.
But now slashing defense seems politically reckless.
   So the foreign-aid pie won't grow much. The House has
finished work on a $15.6 billion foreign-aid bill for next
year, a billion dollars more than this year but not nearly as
much as the U.S. could use. All told, the foreign-aid program
now is a shadow of what it was in the post-World War II
period, when the U.S. devoted 2% to 3% of its gross national
product to foreign aid. Today, it devotes less than 0.3%.
                                                                                                       

   The Economy
                                                                                                       

   Administration officials continue to predict that the
economy will narrowly escape recession, but many private
analysts are far less optimistic. In any event, the nation is
clearly facing a very sluggish period.
   For Mr. Bush, two things compound the problem. With the
deficit out of control, he has few spending or tax tools to
cushion the blow or add economic stimulus. And second, the
sorry state of the nation's financial system makes any
slowdown particularly precarious.
   For the savings and loan fiasco, rising oil prices may
turn out to be a blessing; increased oil drilling in Texas
could eventually raise the value of some of the foreclosed
property the U.S. holds.
   But in the banking community, many institutions are on the
brink of trouble. William Seidman, head of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, says the FDIC now has nearly
1,000 on its problem-bank list, quadruple the number of a
decade ago. A nationwide recession could push many of those
banks over the edge, quickly outweighing any benefits reaped
by S&amp;Ls in the Southwest.
   "In the postwar era, we've never gone into a recession
with anywhere near the same number of problem banks," says
Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution. "It means a lot
more bank failures." And bank failures, in turn, could
undermine confidence in the economy and make the recession
even deeper.

   NEW YORK -- A planned late-night series created by
producer Norman Lear for CBS Inc.'s television network has
been scrapped one month before it was scheduled to premiere.
   The half-hour program, "Jody Gordon and the News," was to
have been two 15-minute shows woven together and was to have
marked the return to television of Mr. Lear, who created such
CBS hits as "All in the Family," "One Day At a Time" and
"Maude."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A CBS spokeswoman said Mr. Lear asked to be let out of his
contract so he could concentrate on "Sunday Dinner," a
prime-time series he is developing. The late-night show was
to air at 12:40 a.m., following reruns of "Wiseguy" and "21
Jump Street."
   CBS hasn't succeeded in gaining a foothold in the
late-night time period, most recently failing with the "Pat
Sajak Show." As previously reported, CBS is considering a new
half-hour news show for the 11:30 p.m. slot, to be anchored
by CBS News correspondents Charles Kuralt and Lesley Stahl.

   Bush and Gorbachev Will Use Summit to Display
   Their Unity -- After Spelling Out Mideast Aims

   The meeting between President Bush and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev Sunday in Helsinki is intended to send a
strong message to Iraq that the new-found Washington-Moscow
unity isn't about to crack.
   The meeting "is a fairly dramatic way of signaling that
things are getting tougher and tougher for Saddam Hussein,"
says a senior Bush administration official involved in
preparing for the talks. "It should remove from his mind any
thoughts that he can split the U.S. and the Soviets on this
one."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But officials in Washington are well aware that Mr.
Gorbachev will first need some explanations of American
intentions in the Persian Gulf. They say Mr. Bush may advise
Mr. Gorbachev that a small U.S. presence could remain
indefinitely as part of a planned new security arrangement in
the region. The State Department is already contemplating a
Soviet role in any such arrangement, U.S. officials say.
   For his part, Mr. Gorbachev is likely to explain why
Soviet military specialists still are stationed in Iraq. In
public, the Kremlin has insisted that the 160 specialists
weren't involved in Iraqi preparations for the Kuwait
invasion and will be withdrawn when their contracts expire.
In private, however, Mr. Gorbachev seems embarrassed by the
controversy they are causing and reportedly raised the issue
at a recent meeting of his Presidential Council. Now that
most Soviet civilians have been evacuated from both Iraq and
Kuwait, the advisers may be pulled out rapidly, Soviet
officials say.
   Behind such seemingly minor details, some Soviet analysts
detect a bigger discrepancy in the longer-term aims of
Washington and Moscow. Both sides agree on the immediate goal
of getting Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. But beyond that, "I
don't expect the positions {at Helsinki} will be identical,"
says Andrei Kortunov, an analyst at Moscow's U.S.A. and
Canada Institute. "Objectively, the interests of the Soviet
Union and the U.S. are a bit different."
   Mr. Kortunov and others in Moscow contend that while the
U.S. wants to dislodge Saddam Hussein in favor of a more
pro-Western leader, the Kremlin is worried about the effects
of military upheaval in the region. It doesn't want to send
the wrong signals to other Soviet allies in the Middle East,
such as Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization, for
fear they may become more radical. And officials point out
that Moscow and Baghdad are still bound by a 1972 treaty of
friendship and cooperation, with Iraq owing the Soviets more
than $6 billion.
   "The preferable option {for Moscow} is a compromise
involving Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait that allows Saddam
Hussein to save some face publicly, not a total collapse of
the regime," Mr. Kortunov says. But if it became a question
of siding with Iraq or siding with the U.S., Mr. Gorbachev
wouldn't hesitate to choose the latter. "Ultimately, too much
is at stake," Mr. Kortunov says. "Gorbachev would yield."
   Iraq is seeking to exploit any differences that exist
between Moscow and Washington. After meeting Mr. Gorbachev in
the Kremlin, Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, yesterday
described the talks as "constructive, cordial and frank,"
though he admitted there were differences. Unlike the U.S.,
Moscow is prepared to give Iraq a hearing, Mr. Aziz said.
"Our Soviet friends are attentive. I appreciate their
listening to us."
   The U.S. may end up paying a price for continued close
Soviet cooperation over the Persian Gulf crisis.
   After more than a year of aborted efforts, Moscow is now
on the verge of reforms in its creaky economy that would
abandon central planning for a market system. Soviet
economists say such a plan can only succeed if the West
provides aid during a difficult transition period. But so
far, only West Germany has provided cash. Most other Western
nations, including the U.S., have been lukewarm at best.
   Washington is hinting that it may now be willing to do
more. "I think it's fair to say that the Soviet cooperation
in the Gulf has impressed us to the point that we are even
more interested in being supportive economically if we can
be," Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said this
week. Although the U.S. still worries that the Soviet economy
isn't yet in a position to absorb much aid, Mr. Fitzwater
said Moscow's stance in the Gulf crisis, "clearly moves us in
the direction of being more helpful."
   Mr. Gorbachev has some other cards to play apart from the
Gulf. Two arms-control agreements, one on strategic nuclear
forces and one on conventional weapons, are supposed to be
signed later this year. But the negotiations in Geneva and
Vienna have been going slowly in recent weeks, bogged down by
technical details. Some Western analysts in Moscow say that a
pledge of U.S. aid would increase the Kremlin's good will and
help speed up the conclusion of the talks.
   The Helsinki summit should also provide both presidents
with the opportunity to sketch out their ideas for future
arrangements to safeguard world peace.
   U.S. officials say much of Mr. Bush's focus will be on a
new theme emerging in Washington that Saddam Hussein has
unwittingly forced the superpowers and others to start
constructing the post-Cold War world order. Mr. Bush is
convinced that collective action, involving both the U.S. and
the U.S.S.R., can squelch strongmen like Saddam Hussein, not
only in the Mideast but elsewhere, the officials say.
   Such thinking is likely to strike a chord in Mr.
Gorbachev, who has long argued for collective steps to
strengthen international security. But here too, there are
differences. Mr. Gorbachev favors making as much use as
possible of the United Nations. The U.N. played an important
role in the Gulf crisis, approving sanctions against Iraq and
the use of force to implement them. But Secretary of State
James Baker said this week the U.S. would prefer to avoid a
U.N. military command in the Gulf, an idea the Soviets have
advanced.
   Instead, Mr. Baker floated the idea of setting up a
permanent Mideast regional "security structure" to keep the
peace. This would house the small residual American force
that the White House envisions staying on when the Gulf
crisis abates, and possibly a Soviet component. U.S.
officials say Mr. Bush may seek Mr. Gorbachev's reaction to
the idea in Helsinki.
   For their part, the Soviets have again raised the idea of
holding an international Mideast conference to sort out
regional issues such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, Lebanon
and the fate of the Palestinians, as well as the Kuwait
crisis.
   The Soviets deny that they are seeking to link the Gulf to
other Mideast regional problems, as Iraq proposes.
Nonetheless, Israel continues to reject the idea of an
international conference, and Washington is cool to the idea.

   A group of senior executives have completed a buy-out of
Prudential California Realty from its parent, Prudential
Insurance Co. of America. Terms of the sale weren't
disclosed.
   Prudential California Realty was originally part of
Merrill Lynch's real estate business, which Prudential
Insurance acquired a year ago. Since the acquisition, the
Newark, N.J.-based insurance company has been selling blocks
of the residential realty offices to local management because
it believes that the residential real estate business is best
managed at the local level.

<TEXT>
   Prudential California will be the largest independently
owned real estate firm in the state, with 78 offices
extending from the San Francisco Bay area to San Diego and a
sales force of more than 4,200.
   George Rathman, who was chairman of the Prudential
Insurance unit, will serve as chairman and chief executive
officer of the newly independent company. Rick Merrill,
formerly a regional president, was named president and chief
operating officer, and Robert LeFever, another regional
president, will serve as executive vice president. Four
regional directors will serve as limited partners: Joseph
Balla, Rolinda Smith, Roger Ewing and Robert Foster. Steve
Games will continue as president of the company's San Diego
office.

late 1991.

   The 95-mile pipeline will transport gas liquids from the
Caroline field, about 75 miles northwest of Calgary, to
Federated's pipeline system, and on to storage and processing
facilities near Edmonton, or enhanced oil recovery projects
northwest of the city. Shell Canada last week received
regulatory approval to begin developing its Caroline field at
a cost of about C$825 million. Output is expected by early
1993.

   Latest Stock Play: `Defensive Growth'

   Fears of a Recession
   And War Spur Shift

   NEW YORK -- With war in the air and corporate earnings
looking shaky, stock market investors have a new game:
defensive growth.
   Growth-stock managers saw their portfolios soar in the
first half of this year. But now, many are shedding old
consumer growth favorites such as Walt Disney Co. and
shifting into a group they have dubbed "defensive growth" or
"recession-resistant growth."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Defensive growth companies are resistant to war and
recession, they say, while still delivering robust earnings
growth.
   Now, with the economy looking even sicker than it did a
month ago, defensive growth companies that are expanding
earnings at 15% to 20% a year are even more attractive, the
growth-stock stalwarts insist.
   "We think recent events have underscored the importance of
owning growth stocks," says Graham Tanaka, president of
Tanaka Capital Management Inc.
   Eldon Mayer, chairman of growth-stock manager Lynch &amp;
Mayer Inc., says he recently cut his holdings of
consumer-related stocks such as MCI Communications Corp.,
Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and Disney, and bought defensive
issues such as Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,
Merck &amp; Co., Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Gillette Co.
   Mr. Tanaka says, "We would like to buy recession-resistant
growth stocks." And he says he has found an attractive story
in National Health Laboratories Inc. "They are the
lowest-cost provider of clinical lab testing, they are
growing earnings at 20% to 25% rate without acquisitions," he
says. "They have a high return on equity."
   He still likes his holdings of Humana Inc., American
Cyanamid Co. and Pfizer Inc. "The health-care sector has held
up beautifully," he says.
   All share a defensive-growth theme: No matter how high oil
prices go or how deeply the economy slumps, people still get
sick.
   For the first half of this year, growth-stock managers
were superstars of investing. As investors saw the economy
grinding toward even slower growth, they rushed into
companies that would generate earnings because of their
strong products, strong franchises and talented management.
Growth-stock managers already owned many of these stocks and
watched them soar.
   Growth-stock managers were confident that a select group
of consumer issues could still generate hefty earnings
increases, even as a slowing economy muddled along; few
predicted a severe recession.
   Now, amid war clouds in the Mideast, consumer confidence
is sliding. Rising oil prices have added to inflation
pressures. And, most important, earnings estimates for
hundreds of stocks are being drastically slashed.
   Benjamin Zacks, executive vice president at Zacks
Investment Research, says 72% of the analysts' revisions in
their 1991 earnings estimates for about 4,000 companies
tracked by his company have been downgradings. No sector of
the stock market, except energy, has been spared. In a recent
survey, Mr. Zacks found that the percentage of downgradings
for 1990 and 1991 earnings was even higher, 78%, for cyclical
stocks whose fortunes rise and fall with the economy.
   "What we want to avoid to the greatest possible extent is
negative earnings surprises," Mr. Mayer, the money manager,
says of his recent defensive-growth purchases.
   What is questionable is whether there really are
bulletproof growth stocks, immune to economic and political
shocks. While many growth managers are still ahead of market
benchmarks for the year, the Mideast conflict has made the
growth bet more risky.
   Many growth stocks were sold in the market's slide last
month. But many investors hung on to their shares, hoping for
a resolution of the Mideast crisis quickly and without much
economic damage. Consequently, growth stocks could be poised
for big losses if investors start to bail out of the market.
   "If the stock market starts to go down a lot -- for
whatever reason -- people aren't going to sell Boston
Edison," says Stefan Abrams, chief investment strategist at
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "They are going to sell the large,
liquid, big-name growth stocks." Elizabeth Bramwell, chief
investment officer of the Gabelli Growth Fund, agrees that
the risks are greater now for managers who are still betting
on growth issues. With peace blooming across the globe
earlier this summer, growth-stock managers were ecstatic
about the earnings opportunities for companies with
international franchises, such as McDonald's Corp. and
PepsiCo Inc. Now, long-term earnings expectations for
multinational corporations have undergone a sharp
reassessment.
   "In the first half, peace was breaking out around the
world -- you could take a longer-term view," Ms. Bramwell
says. "We were looking to the year 2000. Then we shrank back
to what's going to happen in the next 24 hours."
   With these threats in mind, she, too, has moved her
portfolio toward defensive growth. She has bought Medical
Care International Inc., which she expects to show a 25% to
30% improvement in earnings in 1991. She also likes
Colgate-Palmolive Co., Tambrands Inc. and Procter &amp; Gamble.
The big agricultural firm Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. is her
largest holding.
   "It's really too bad," Ms. Bramwell says. "The year
started off so positively."

   Teen-Age Boys Are the Lost Market in Magazine Land

   Say you're a typical 14-year-old boy. You like sports,
video games, cars and junk food. But occasionally you wonder:
Did that girl really want me to kiss her or was she totally
grossed out? Am I the groovemeister I think I am or just a
garden-variety geek?
   When girls are confronted by such adolescent travails,
they turn to Seventeen, Sassy, YM or Teen, four magazines
dedicated to the teen-age girl. But teen-age boys have only
one magazine to call their own -- Boy's Life -- and that is
known for its coverage of hobbies like stamp-collecting
rather than the emotional peaks and valleys of the teen
years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At a time when publishers are deluging the market with
magazines for men, and when niches from bow-hunters to
back-pain sufferers have their own journals, teen-age boys
remain the forgotten people. They may read Sports Illustrated
for sports, Playboy for thrills, Rolling Stone for music or
comics for fun, but their own lives remain unexamined in the
pages of magazines. Advertisers and publishers say that's
because teen-age boys read less than girls, buy less and
wouldn't be caught dead contemplating such touchy-feely
things as how they look or feel.
   Recent research suggests that is changing. From a very
early age, boys care about how they look, new data suggest.
Beginning in their mid-teens, many boys start aching to be
popular. And by the age of 16, boys spend more on clothes
than any other item. Yet although a few more publishers are
beginning to dip their toes into the teen-age-boy pond, most
still believe it's quicksand.
   "If they're not Boy Scouts or sports fans or into hot-rod
cars, there's no core," says Robert Schmidt, chairman of the
Levine, Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver ad agency. "There's no one
subject that you can build a magazine around. You can reach
these guys elsewhere -- on radio, late night television and
Saturday afternoon sports events."
   Yet Jane Pratt, editor in chief of Sassy magazine,
believes boys are more interested in themselves than most
people think. "Teen-age boys are hipper than they used to
be," says Ms. Pratt. "And they spend more on beauty products,
which they call grooming. With so many broken homes and
families with both parents working, kids have to be adults a
lot faster."
   A year from now, Lang Communications' Sassy plans to
publish a boys' edition of the magazine that will go to Sassy
subscribers, with the idea that they will pass it along to a
brother or boyfriend, and that may be sold on newsstands.
Field &amp; Stream magazine, a unit of Times Mirror, plans to
introduce Field &amp; Stream Jr. as a special section in its
November issue, aimed at kids interested in traditional-boy
endeavors like hunting and fishing. But it won't cover how
boys look and feel, despite research indicating that boys
care about such things.
   Indeed, in a poll commissioned by Sports Illustrated for
Kids, a new publication aimed at 8-to-14-year-old boys and
girls, as many boys as girls admitted using hair mousse.
Also, many boys under 12 years old are regular users of
mouthwash and deodorant, and more than half use hairspray.
"These kids don't smell," says Susan Alexander, marketing
director of S.I. for Kids. "This is about adopting grown-up
roles much younger." In the poll, most young boys said they
thought kids have to dress well to be cool, and half the boys
thought having a cool haircut contributed to overall
coolness.
   Boys 13 to 15 years old spend most of their money on food,
but at 16, clothes take over as No. 1, according to Lester
Rand of the Rand Youth Poll. Girls 16 to 19 years old still
spend more money overall each week than boys ($63.50 vs.
$54.60), but, Mr. Rand says, "the boys are closing in."
   Yet the consensus among advertisers and publishers is that
a magazine for teenage boys would be an uphill battle. The
biggest advertising categories in men's magazines -- tobacco,
alcoholic beverages and automobiles -- would be unsuitable or
severely limited in a magazine for boys. Other male
categories -- music, electronics and video games, for example
-- aren't big enough to support a boys' magazine the way
fashion, cosmetics and fragrance are for girls.
   "I guarantee you there's an editorial mix that would
appeal to boys," says Bobbie Halfin, Sassy's publisher, who
before joining Sassy considered starting a magazine for teen
boys. "But where are you going to get the ad pages? The
advertising side for boys just isn't as rich as it is for
girls."
   In the case of Boy's Life, ads come from some mass
marketers, such as Coca-Cola and General Mills, and from
special-interest advertisers like Coleman camping products
and Wilson sporting goods. Chuck Carroll, Boy's Life's
advertising director, says Levi jeans recently began
advertising in the magazine. "The buying power of the market
is growing," says Mr. Carroll. "Parents feel guilty about
leaving John and Susie alone, so they're more liberal about
giving them an extra few bucks to spend." The magazine, which
is owned by the Boy Scouts of America, has a circulation of
1.3 million.
   Field &amp; Stream decided to introduce its magazine for boys
because "research shows a real need for a magazine that
addresses kids on their own level," says Jack Grant, Field &amp;
Stream Jr.'s publisher. As for including advice about the
opposite sex in his magazine, Mr. Grant doubts that boys
would want it. "It's a macho thing with boys," he says.
"They'd probably want to read it, but they wouldn't want the
next kid to know they were."
   Sassy's edition for boys will be prepared by an all-male
staff, and, says Ms. Halfin, no females -- including herself
-- will be allowed to tamper with the product. "We don't want
what girls think guys think," says Ms. Halfin. "We want what
guys think."
   Yet knowing what a teen thinks at any given time is like
knowing where a fly will next alight. "These kids will fool
you every time," says Ann Moore, publisher of S.I. for Kids.
"If you miss this market by an inch, you've lost it." Yet
kids also have ferocious preferences, intense brand loyalty
and little hesitation about rejecting their parents' choices.
"You might as well grind up a $50 bill," says Ms. Moore, "as
buy your kid a pair of shoes without their input."

stuffing.
   As part of the promotion, Kraft, a unit of Philip Morris,
said it will give away $500 million in coupons, its largest
coupon program ever. The coupons will be distributed in
newspapers beginning in November. Consumers redeeming three
of the coupons will get a free copy of the magazine.

   Thames Television PLC of Britain, a broadcasting concern,
reported that pretax profit for the six months ended June 30
fell 34% to #10.3 million ($19.6 million) from #15.7 million
a year earlier, damped largely by sluggish advertising
revenue.
   The year-earlier half ended Sept. 30, 1989; the company
has changed to a calendar-year accounting period. Net profit
attributable to shareholders, or profit after taxes and
extraordinary items, totaled #6.59 million, a decline of
#71.1 million. Per-share earnings fell 34% to 14.5 pence from
22.1 pence.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales rose 10% to #183 million from #166 million.
   The dividend is unchanged at 5.15 pence a share.
   Thames in June warned of poor interim earnings, saying
that depressed advertising revenue, new tax arrangements, and
costs relating to its $89 million acquisition of Reeves
Communications Corp. of the U.S. would weigh heavily on the
results.
   Thames said BET PLC and Thorn EMI PLC, which each own 28%
of the company, are still in the process of disposing of
their stakes. It didn't disclose further details.

   Judge Extends Freeze

   NEW YORK -- A federal judge extended a freeze on the
payment of claims by the Manville asbestos personal-injury
trust while it continues to negotiate its refinancing.
   Judge Jack B. Weinstein of federal court in Brooklyn had
ordered the trust to come up with new financing by yesterday.
But in his latest order, the judge said that negotiators had
requested additional time to work out details of the
proposal. The judge extended the freeze until Oct. 6, but the
new financing is expected to be announced before then.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The trust was set up as part of Manville Corp.'s
bankruptcy court reorganization plan in 1988 to pay the
thousands of asbestos personal-injury claims against the
company. Asbestos, once widely used in construction and
shipyards, causes cancer and respiratory ailments years after
exposure.
   Under the reorganization plan, Manville can't be sued by
asbestos victims; instead, all asbestos personal-injury
claims must be filed against the trust, which is funded by
the company.
   Although the trust has assets of $2.6 billion, it has run
out of cash to pay claims and has said it won't begin paying
claims filed after 1989 for at least 25 years. Judge
Weinstein has ordered the trust to restructure its financing
and payment plans to overcome that delay.
   The company and the trust declined to comment on their
refinancing negotiations. Currently, new funding from the
company isn't scheduled to begin until next fall. The freeze
on claim payments allows exceptions for hardship cases.

the Gulf of Mexico.
   The platform, located at a site called South Pass Block
86, will be used to develop more than 50 million equivalent
barrels of hydrocarbon liquids discovered in 1988. The well
tested at a rate of 9.6 million cubic feet of gas per day and
1,270 barrels of condensate per day.

   The offshore Louisiana field was further delineated by a
second well, which tested at a rate of 3,666 barrels of oil
per day and 4.3 million cubic feet of gas per day.
   The platform is being designed to handle production of
20,000 barrels of oil per day, with an initial gas handling
capacity of 100 million cubic feet per day. Installation is
set for early 1992.
   Other partners in the development are Amerada Hess Corp.,
the Louisiana Land &amp; Exploration Co. and OKC Limited
Partnership. Each owns 25% of South Pass Block 86.

   SAUDI ARABIA PLEDGED billions of dollars to offset costs
of the Gulf crisis.
   The oil kingdom told Secretary of State Baker in Jiddah
that it will use much of its oil-price windfall since the

   WASHINGTON -- Thrift regulators said they amended civil
charges against Thomas Spiegel, seeking an unspecified amount
of additional restitution from the former executive of
Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association.
   The new charges by the Office of Thrift Supervision accuse
Mr. Spiegel of causing the thrift to incur an additional loss
of $29.2 million by building lavish new corporate
headquarters in Beverly Hills, Calif. The building, according
to the regulators, was built without regard to cost, and
included a multilevel gymnasium, "survival chamber" bathrooms
with bullet-proof glass, and an independent air and food
supply.

<TEXT>
   In July, the OTS filed civil charges against Mr. Spiegel,
accusing him of using thrift funds for such acquisitions as a
huge gun collection, aircraft and $7,000 in Michael Jackson
concert tickets. The agency sought $24 million in restitution
and penalties at that time. Mr. Spiegel denied all charges.
   Contrary to past practice, the hearing for Mr. Spiegel
will be public, the regulators said, as will an
administrative hearing of civil charges against Charles
Keating, former chairman of the parent of Lincoln Savings &amp;
Loan Association, Irvine, Calif. Neither hearing date has
been set.

   Apple Computer Inc.'s USA division said it slashed prices
as much as 20% effective yesterday on its popular Macintosh
IIci personal computer.
   The price reduction is tied to the Cupertino, Calif.,
company's Oct. 15 introduction of three new lower-priced
personal computer models, said analyst Bruce M. Lupatkin of
Hambrecht and Quist in San Francisco.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's basically product positioning," Lupatkin said.
   Apple officials denied this was the case, saying they were
simply following up on a successful marketing program two
months ago under which dealers were given flexibility in
offering discounts on the product.
   "Since then we've seen sales of the IIci take off," said
Bob Puette, president of Apple USA.
   The prices were slashed $1,500 on Apple's four system
configurations for the Macintosh IIci. The highest-priced
model with a 4MB RAM/SuperDrive floppy, for instance, was cut
to $5,969 from $7,469. The Macintosh IIci was introduced in
September 1989 and is considered in the middle of the
company's Macintosh line.
   Apple Computer shares closed at $35.75, down 25 cents, in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday.

   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- A Pinnacle West Capital Corp.
shareholder charged the utility holding company and its
directors with entering into a "greenmail" pact with
PacifiCorp "to neutralize PacifiCorp's takeover threat."
   PacifiCorp, a utility company based in Portland, Ore.,
agreed Friday to drop its 10-month pursuit of Pinnacle West
in exchange for seasonal power swaps with Pinnacle West's
Arizona utility unit in an agreement valued at $260 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a suit filed Wednesday in state court here, the
shareholder alleges that the transaction is a breach of the
defendants' fiduciary duty and was reached by the directors
primarily to entrench themselves and company management.
   A Pinnacle West spokesman said he couldn't comment on the
suit because the company hadn't seen it. PacifiCorp, which
wasn't named as a defendant, said it doesn't comment on
litigation.
   The suit seeks to block consummation of the power-swap
agreement and unspecified damages if it is completed. The
suit was brought by Moise Katz of New York, who owns 100
Pinnacle West shares, "for the benefit" of the company.
   Greenmail is a term usually applied to the practice in
which outsiders buy a company's stock and then entice the
company to buy the shares back at a premium to avoid a
takeover. In the suit, greenmail refers to the power-sharing
agreement being used to avoid a takeover.
   Since that agreement was reached, the price of Pinnacle
West shares, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
has dropped $3.125 to $13.

   Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB of Sweden, a pulp and paper

operations of Feldmuehle Nobel AG of West Germany until at
least next year.
   Instead, Stora unveiled plans to sell three Swedish units,
probably before year end, to help finance its four billion
mark ($2.56 billion) takeover of Feldmuehle, initially
announced in April.

   Stora's share of the purchase price swelled unexpectedly
yesterday, when its board agreed to acquire the 24.9%
Feldmuehle Nobel stake held by AB Investor and AB
Providentia, affiliated holding companies in Sweden's

shareholders, had joined forces with the forestry giant in
its pursuit of Feldmuehle and had been expected to continue
as minority owners and play key roles in disposing of the
West German concern's non-forestry operations.
   Analysts said the withdrawal probably reflects increasing
financial strains within the Wallenberg group, caused by a
flurry of big acquisitions in recent months.

   `Case of the Hairline Cracks' on Compaq's PCs
   Is Just One of Several Woes Depressing Stock

   A company declaring a stock split usually hopes to boost
its shares by making them seem more affordable. But a recent
split hasn't done a thing for Compaq Computer.
   The personal computer maker, long a Wall Street favorite,
split 2-for-1 in early July. The shares were above a
split-adjusted 61 1/2. But as the weeks rolled by and both
Dean Witter and Oppenheimer &amp; Co. lowered their opinions to
"hold" from "buy," the stock has plummeted 34%, to 45 1/2.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Technology stocks are always prone to zigzags, of course,
and the Mideast crisis is reason enough for a drop. But that
alone doesn't explain what's been happening to Compaq. Last
Friday, for instance, the Houston Chronicle reported that
some of Compaq's notebook-sized laptop computers were
developing hairline cracks after brief use.
   It was a blow for quality-conscious Compaq, which says
this is the first widespread defect it has ever had in a
product it shipped to market. Word of the potentially
damaging report even reached Benjamin C. Rosen, Compaq's
chairman, on the golf course.
   "The cracked cases are an old story," insists Daniel C.
Benton, a Goldman Sachs analyst. A similar report surfaced
six months ago. Yet a Compaq spokeswoman doesn't blithely
shrug off the story. "We originally believed it was just one
lot," she says, "but now we're not so sure."
   Houston-based Compaq took another hit Wednesday, as
semiconductor analysts lowered estimates for chip companies
and cited a slowdown in demand for chips from personal
computer makers.
   Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch have been projecting
profit of $5 a share for this year, up from a split-adjusted
$3.88 a share in 1989. They have continued to recommend the
shares. Edmund Spelman of Oppenheimer thinks their
projections may be "too aggressive," however, and consensus
per-share estimates by analysts are $4.66 for 1990 and $5.53
for 1991, according to Thomson Financial Networks.
   Analysts continue to praise the company's management and
high-performance product line. A question mark is Systempro,
an important and costly new class of computer for business
users announced last fall. "A lot of earnings projections are
pegged to Systempro sales," says analyst Eric C. Zimits at
Rauscher Pierce Refsnes.
   Compaq has said it expected to sell only a few thousand
units in the first year, and is right on target so far. Yet
some analysts conditioned by Compaq's past triumphs expected
much more, perhaps as many as 25,000 sold by year end. "The
Systempro makes Wall Street nervous," says Rick Martin of
Prudential-Bache.
   Compaq also now faces serious price competition from Dell
Computer, an Austin, Texas, mail-order computer firm with a
modest following in data-processing circles.
   Last week, Dell announced two Systempro lookalikes,
including a high-end 425TE that runs about $12,000 compared
with Compaq's Systempro at $17,000 or higher. Speculation
persists that International Business Machines soon will
announce a powerful personal computer much like Systempro and
priced competitively.
   Once Systempro stirred concern on the Street, ghosts began
looming around every corner. Analysts even fretted about
Compaq's 21% share of Conner Peripherals after word spread
that disk-drive maker Quantum Corp. of Milpitas, Calif.,
would soon offer a drive that could erode Conner's market
share.
   Some analysts also brood about a laptop that IBM is said
to be introducing to challenge Compaq's best-selling Compaq
LTE. Although Oppenheimer's Mr. Spelman says "IBM's bark is
usually worse than its bite" in the personal computer market,
he believes IBM has finally "gotten its act together" and
could pose a threat.
   Compaq is expected to score points with a new laptop of
its own in the next few weeks. Enthusiasm for that
introduction has been tempered by concern over an onslaught
of Japanese competition. "The {profit} margins on laptops are
going to be coming down," predicts Eugene G. Glazer of Dean
Witter Reynolds.
   Foreign markets have been a bragging point for Compaq in
recent years. Yet one analyst believes that a seasonal
third-quarter slowdown in European sales will hit Compaq
harder this year than in the past; it got 45% of 1989 sales
from Europe, compared with 39% a year earlier.
   Analysts' misgivings come in the midst of a slowing U.S.
computer market, which does little to soothe Wall Street's
itchy trigger fingers. "The PC business is headed into a
period of restructuring that will last a number of years,"
says Mark D. Stahlman, analyst with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons.

   Adler &amp; Shaykin Buy-Out Firm Withers as the LBO Era Wanes

</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- In its heyday in the late 1980s, the leveraged
buy-out team of Fred Adler and Leonard Shaykin made headlines
by carrying out $2.5 billion of acquisitions.
   Their small firm, Adler &amp; Shaykin, bought mining equipment
maker Joy Manufacturing Co., catalog retailer Best Products
Inc. and the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper, usually positioning
itself as a "white knight" that helped managements ward off
corporate raiders. Adler &amp; Shaykin also nearly bought Revlon
Inc.'s beauty business in 1985, but was outmuscled by Ronald
Perelman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But now, Adler &amp; Shaykin seems a case study of how the LBO
bonanza of the 1980s has petered out. Adler &amp; Shaykin's
offices in Manhattan's Seagrams Building have become a
financial ghost town. The firm hasn't announced an
acquisition bid since late 1988. Excluding support staff,
only Mr. Shaykin and an associate a year out of business
school currently work full time at the headquarters. Visitors
aren't allowed past the 14th floor reception area, from which
they can glimpse a long row of empty offices.
   Adler &amp; Shaykin's investment portfolio is a mixed bag now.
The firm's biggest likely winner is Joy, which has robust
operating profit that is 2 1/2 times its interest bill. Best
Products, however, posted a $26.3 million loss for the
quarter ended May 5, and is competing in the difficult
Northeast retailing market. The Chicago Sun-Times doesn't
report financial figures, but Mr. Shaykin says it has been
affected by a nationwide downturn in newspaper advertising.
   In the past 15 months, three of the six general partners
of Adler &amp; Shaykin have quit, leaving only Messrs. Adler and
Shaykin and turnaround specialist Jerry Goldress. Several
junior "associates" also have left, and this past month two
midlevel "principals" walked out, too.
   Mr. Shaykin insists everything is fine. "We anticipated a
downturn in the LBO business, and we've managed our staffing
level accordingly," he says. Adler &amp; Shaykin is changing its
strategy, he adds, to focus on investing in "undermanaged"
companies that can improve their fundamental operations.
   Still, many on Wall Street wonder if Adler &amp; Shaykin can
revive itself. Opportunities for big buy-outs have withered
in the past year, as a collapsing junk-bond market, high
stock prices and widespread aversion to the financial
excesses of the 1980s have made LBOs less attractive to
financial backers and corporate executives.
   "Business is slow," says John Miller, an executive vice
president at Equitable Capital Management Corp., which
invests with Adler &amp; Shaykin. "It's probably a good thing
that Adler &amp; Shaykin is smaller now."
   As its people depart, Adler &amp; Shaykin has managed to
invest only 3% of the $178 million buy-out fund that the firm
raised in 1988 from banks, pension funds and insurance
companies. That, too, is according to strategy, Mr. Shaykin
maintains. He says he plans to take a "patient" approach in
investing the fund. Some institutional backers such as
Equitable say that in the current tough business climate,
that's fine.
   However, several commercial bank investors are more
anxious about the buy-out fund, which still generates more
than $2 million a year in management fees for Adler &amp;
Shaykin, even if none of the money gets invested. The fund
has nearly nine years left to run.
   Not all Adler &amp; Shaykin's problems can be traced to the
LBO slump, former employees of the firm say. People who have
worked with Mr. Shaykin describe him as a combative person
who has been reluctant to share much of the firm's equity
with other partners. Says Mr. Shaykin: "We never tried to
build up a big staff. We wanted people who shared our
values."
   Frictions also have arisen with now-departed staffers over
the role of the 66-year-old Mr. Adler, a well-known venture
capitalist and New York lawyer. Mr. Adler retains a large
ownership stake in Adler &amp; Shaykin though he doesn't work
there on a daily basis. Mr. Adler says he still gives Adler &amp;
Shaykin 50% of his time.
   For a nearly a year, executive recruiters at
Russell-Reynolds Associates Inc. have tried to fill vacancies
at Adler &amp; Shaykin. So far, the recruiters have been stumped.
Says one New York LBO specialist who was approached earlier
this year about joining Adler &amp; Shaykin: "Leonard has trouble
keeping people."
   Of the firm's five former partners, John Quigley left late
last year to pursue a doctorate at Columbia University;
Philip Behr left to set up his own small LBO shop; and
Michael Bruce quit to start a money-management boutique.
Messrs. Quigley and Bruce declined to comment; Mr. Behr
didn't return phone calls.
   Mr. Shaykin still has his fans. "In good times, he's a
treat to work for," says Mark Wray, chief executive officer
of Joy. "He speaks carefully and thoughtfully." Hamilton
James III, a top investment banker at Donaldson Lufkin
Jenrette Securities Corp., adds that Mr. Shaykin "has a good
real world perspective. He has a good instinctive feel
whether an acquisition makes sense."
   Adler &amp; Shaykin has been willing to grow some of its
portfolio companies by acquisitions, helping the Chicago
SunTimes expand by acquiring suburban Chicago newspapers, for
example. But Mr. Shaykin has been tough on chief executive
officers -- ousting the original chief executives at all four
of Adler &amp; Shaykin's biggest companies in favor of newcomers
he helped to choose.
   In trying to rebuild Adler &amp; Shaykin, Mr. Shaykin last
year elevated Mr. Goldress, the turnaround specialist, to be
a managing general partner. Mr. Goldress, 60, is chairman of
Best and Wherehouse Entertainment; he lives in Incline
Village, Nev.
   Asked if there's any chance that Adler &amp; Shaykin might
close up shop and let its investors reclaim the money they
have committed to the buy-out fund, the 46-year-old Mr.
Shaykin says: "No. That's silliness. There will be major
buying opportunities in the next 24 months."
   The recent flurry of personnel departures really shouldn't
be seen as worrisome, Mr. Shaykin adds. "We're all
replaceable," he contends. "Even I am."

   Despite Slowdown and Mideast Unrest,

   The Middle East erupts. Business failures increase. Big
corporations batten down the hatches for recession.
   But small business will fare better than many expect, says
William C. Dunkelberg. "Small businesses have nothing to
worry about. They've seen it all before," he says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 47-year-old Mr. Dunkelberg, one of the country's best
known small-business economists, still sees little to make
him abandon his usual optimistic outlook for small business.
His views enjoy a wide following. Currently dean of Temple
University's School of Business and Management, Mr.
Dunkelberg is also chief economist of the National Federation
of Independent Business, the country's largest small-business
group. He produces the federation's influential quarterly
economic report for small business.
   In a recent interview, Mr. Dunkelberg discussed prospects
for small companies in today's economic climate:
                                                                                                       

   Q. Given the growth in business failures lately, is small
business facing an economic recession?
   A. No. Economic activity among small businesses looks too
strong to produce a recession this year.
   The economy has just gone through an unprecedented
expansion and this growth created an unrealistic exuberance.
When reality set in, many firms found that the markets
weren't big enough to support all of the new entrants and
that the high growth rates, in fact, wouldn't go on forever.
   High rates of growth invariably produce high failure rates
when the economy begins to adjust itself. But that doesn't
mean that small business isn't healthy.
                                                                                                       

   Q. But isn't overall business activity slowing down?
   A. Yes. But the slowdown is relative to peak levels of
activity achieved during eight years of economic expansion.
Most small businesses would probably be happy to freeze
today's performance if they could be guaranteed it for the
next five years. They'd rather do that than take their
chances with an uncertain economy.
   Things look bad only because we've had a decade of
extraordinary growth under the Reagan Administration. What we
are experiencing is a period of slower growth, not a downturn
of cataclysmic proportions.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Still, given the Iraq crisis and its impact on oil
prices, the cost of the savings and loan bailout and
continued economic weakness, small businesses can't be
breathing easy.
   A. Historically, war has always provided a stimulus for
economic growth. War means heavy government spending, more
jobs, higher incomes . . . and small business benefits
greatly in this scenario.
   The major threat the S&amp;L crisis poses to small business is
that interest rates will continue to stay high. Fortunately,
many small businesses have no debt or don't rely heavily on
frequent borrowing.
   {Only 11% of business owners queried in the latest NFIB
survey said financing was harder to arrange than earlier in
the year. Only 12% -- up from 9% in the previous quarter --
said they expected borrowing to be more difficult in the
coming months.}
   What is most worrisome for small businesses is the
continuing weakness in the economy. That translates into
fewer customers through the door, lower cash flow and a
reduction in employment. But a war and the increased spending
that accompanies it should more than counteract the
weaknesses in the economy.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Do small businesses share your vision?
   A. Small-business optimism is the lowest it's been since
1982. We're back at pre-expansion levels. But the bottom
hasn't dropped out of the outlook as it did in 1979.
   In sharp contrast to 1979, small businesses still have
plans to hire. They have no excessive inventory. Most
important, they have been managing their firms in the
expectation of a repeat of the recession they faced between
1980 and 1982.
   {In the NFIB's latest quarterly economic survey, 22% of
those queried said they expected business to worsen, compared
with 14% in the previous quarter.}
                                                                                                       

   Q. How will small business fare over the next five years?
   A. The prospects for small firms are excellent. First, the
outlook for the economy is good. Within that framework, the
successful firm of the future has to be flexible, more
niche-oriented, able to change quickly to changes in demand
and in technology. All these -- characteristics of small
businesses -- favor the smaller size firm.
                                                                                                       

   Q. You feel that small businesses will do better than the
economy as a whole?
   A. I don't think so. One reason is that legislators may
force smaller firms to carry a larger share of the costs of
the social programs in the '90s. Such programs as parental
leave, disability, environment and health care will become
costlier and small businesses will be asked to increase their
contribution. The difficulty of attracting qualified labor --
and the costs of training -- will also raise costs for small
firms. Nonetheless, small businesses will contribute a
greater portion of the new job growth in the next decade.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Will some small businesses benefit more than others?
   A. That's really a guessing game, isn't it? Still, there
are some fundamental factors that help identify those more
likely to succeed.
   Service businesses, which are dominated by small firms,
will continue to demonstrate strong growth, especially in
areas of information processing and services. Manufacturing
also will become attractive because of its high-tech
component and its need for adaptability.
                                                                                                       

   Q. Who's likely to be hurt the most?
   A. Specialized retailers in urban areas. The deterioration
of urban markets means a shrinking customer base and fewer
customers. Small construction firms also face serious
problems for the next five years. We've tremendously
overbuilt and the demographics are turning negative for
further expansion: We have a seven-year supply of office
space, three-year supply of multi-family housing units and an
overabundance of traditional family homes for a decade.
   A rise in oil prices obviously will affect such
fuel-intensive businesses as transportation. But if business
demand stays strong, they can pass it on to the customer.

   Fedders Corp. said it will report a loss for the second
half of 1990 because cooler-than-normal summer weather
reduced demand for air conditioners and left the company with
excess inventory.
   The Peapack, N.J., air conditioner manufacturer declined
to estimate the expected loss. Officials said, however, that
the company will be profitable for the full year. A
spokeswoman said the company will return to profitability in
the first quarter of 1991.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nevertheless, investors appear wary: In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, Fedders shares fell
$1.75 to $7.375.
   For the second half of 1989, Fedders reported profit of
$7.4 million, or 39 cents a share; an extraordinary gain of
$1.5 million made net income $8.9 million, or 47 cents a
share. For 1990's first half, the company reported net of
$15.5 million, or 83 cents a share, on revenue of $215.9
million.

   PARIS -- Rhone-Poulenc S.A. and Lafarge Coppee S.A. said
their joint subsidiary, Clause S.A., sold its wholly owned
Truffaut S.A. unit to the French trading and distribution
concern Cora-Revillon S.A.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but people close to the two
companies said the purchase price was roughly equivalent to
one year's revenue for Truffaut, or about 700 million francs
($133.9 million).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Truffaut has a chain of garden centers throughout France
and is the leader in its sector.
   A spokesman for Lafarge, Europe's biggest cement producer,
said the sale was in line with the stated intention of
Rhone-Poulenc and Lafarge to spin off Clause's assets that
weren't directly related to its core activity of seed
production.
   Separately, state-owned Rhone-Poulenc said it intends to
sell its polyvinyl chloride operations in Spain to Atochem
S.A., a unit of the French state-controlled oil company
Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine.
   On Wednesday, Rhone-Poulenc said its first-half group
profit fell 14% because of the strength of the French franc
and economic austerity in Brazil.

   WASHINGTON -- Americans are hardening their line toward
Iraq and are increasingly optimistic about eventual U.S.
success in the Persian Gulf but believe that the conflict
will be protracted, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC
News poll.
   The survey, conducted Tuesday and Wednesday, found that
68% of the 800 persons polled believe the U.S. has the upper
hand in the conflict, an increase from a Journal/NBC poll 2
1/2 weeks earlier, when 52% said the U.S. held the upper
hand.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the earlier poll, those polled were almost evenly
divided over whether the U.S. will be able to obtain its
objectives without a shooting war. They now say by a margin
of 52% to 36% that the U.S. will prevail without a war.
   Some 84% of those surveyed say the U.S. should respond
militarily if Iraq attacks Saudi Arabia, up from 74% in the
earlier poll; 56%, up from 43%, support military action if
Iraq fails to withdraw from Kuwait. And 72% believe the U.S.
should take military action if hostages are harmed.
   "Resolve and support for the U.S. action is a little
stronger than it was two weeks ago," say pollsters Peter
Hart, a Democrat, and Robert Teeter, a Republican, who
conducted the poll for the Journal and NBC. They ascribe this
to the fact that "all our pieces are now in place in the
Middle East, and there hasn't been some unforeseen blow-up,"
such as a terrorist attack on U.S. targets.
   Those polled don't expect a rapid conclusion to the
crisis. Nearly two out of three believe U.S. troops will be
in Saudi Arabia for at least six months, and four in 10
believe the troops will stay more than a year.
   Only 15% think the mission of the U.S. and its allies
should be limited to protecting Saudi Arabia; 43% say the
U.S. should also regain control in Kuwait, and 31% say the
U.S. should invade Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein.
   Some 50% of those polled say the most important reason the
U.S. is in Saudi Arabia is to protect the world's oil supply.
But they remain strongly opposed to the use of force to
achieve economic goals. Asked whether they support the use of
force if the U.S. develops a shortage that raises gasoline
prices to more than $2 a gallon, 71% say no, up from 64% last
month. And 57%, up from 50%, oppose the use of force even if
oil shortages threaten a major recession and close down some
factories.
   Despite perception that the U.S. will prevail without a
shooting war, two-thirds of those polled believe the worst is
still ahead for the U.S., and they are still closely split on
the question of whether economic sanctions and a blockade
will achieve the nation's objectives. Overall, the poll found
76% support for the deployment of troops to Saudi Arabia and
75% approval of President Bush's handling of the crisis,
small increases from the earlier survey.
   Support for the U.S. action remains strong among
practically all demographic groups. The only exception is
that black voters remain consistently more skeptical of U.S.
action in the Gulf than whites.
   The generally increasing optimism in the poll on the
Mideast didn't extend to the U.S.'s domestic circumstances.
About 58% of those surveyed believe the U.S. is headed for a
recession in the next 12 months, unchanged from last month's
survey, when recession fears sharply increased for the first
time this year.
   By a 45% to 40% margin, voters said things in the U.S. are
generally going in the right direction. That is similar to
the results of a July Journal/NBC poll, but represents a
significant decline in optimism from earlier in the year.
   The poll found no consensus on how to pay for sending U.S.
troops to the Middle East. The most popular option, backed by
38% of voters, is to let the federal budget deficit increase
until the crisis ends. Some 27% say domestic spending should
be cut, and 18% endorse a temporary tax increase. (However,
three in 10 of those favoring spending cuts don't think they
could be big enough to pay for the increased military costs.)
   On the question of defense spending, 61% support keeping
such spending at about the same level, with the remaining
respondents about evenly split between cutting and increasing
defense spending. In a slightly different question asked last
November, 59% of voters supported keeping defense spending
about the same, while 28% favored cutting it and 10% favored
an increase.

   NEW YORK -- AmBase Corp. said it has been asked by the
federal Office of Thrift Supervision to provide a $30 million
capital infusion into its Carteret Savings Bank unit by Dec.
31. The amount is the company's remaining obligation under
the terms of its acquisition of Carteret in 1988.
   The company, which contributed $20 million in December
1989, said it anticipated the request and foresaw no problems
with fulfilling it.

   Britain's ICI Plans
   To Alter Structure
   Of European Units

   Imperial Chemical Industries PLC said it will restructure
its European operations to better position itself for the
single European Community market planned for 1992.
   The British chemical and pharmaceuticals company said the
restructuring will involve creating a new Brussels-based
organization, ICI Europe, to oversee ICI businesses
throughout the 12-nation community and a few other European
countries. Six regional groupings of ICI's European
operations will replace the current 15 national ones.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tom Hutchison, the company's executive director
responsible for Europe, said the move is aimed at cutting
costs and providing better customer service. The company
didn't give any figures on how much it hopes to save and how
many jobs might be eliminated. It said it hopes job losses
will be minimal, considering the further growth it expects in
Europe.
   Mr. Hutchison said ICI's many acquisitions in Europe
during the 1980s left the company with new units that aren't
well integrated into the corporate structure. "We need to
realign and simplify our organization," he said.
   The new structure, to be in place by 1992, would eliminate
current anomalies such as having three ICI companies selling
the same products on the same market, sometimes even to the
same customer, Mr. Hutchison said.
   The move is unlikely to have a major effect on the
company's profitability, according to Richard Henderson, an
analyst at Nomura Securities in London. Mr. Hendersen called
the reorganization "a step in a very sensible direction" that
will transcend national boundaries where necessary or logical
and that should "shake up" the company's large bureaucracy.

   On Sports: `Bigger-Stronger' Footballers

   Football season is upon us again, so brace for the
familiar cliches. We will hear of players who "give 110%" and
others who have a "nose for the football." There will be
quarterbacks with "guns for arms" throwing to receivers who
aren't afraid to "go into traffic" (watch that taxi]). We
will meet coaches who "know their X's and O's" better than
some of their players know their ABCs.
   One cliche, however, deserves more careful consideration.
When we are told that today's players are "bigger, faster and
stronger" than those of any previous era, we should nod our
heads affirmatively, and sadly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The "bigger" part of that proposition should be obvious to
anyone who has watched the TV player introductions during
recent-year autumn Saturday or Sunday afternoons, but one
group has seen fit to quantify it. The College Football
Association, a frankly named assemblage of institutions that
have banded together to promote their interests in the sport,
surveyed the rosters of eight major football factories, uh,
schools, at 10-year intervals and found, among other things,
that their linemen grew from an average of 72.9 inches tall
and 201 pounds in 1959 to 75.3 inches and 253 pounds in 1989.
   National Football League figures show that the average
size of all its players increased to 6-foot-2 and 231 pounds
last year from 6-1 1/2 and 216 in 1958. But they contained no
breakdown by positions, so to focus on offensive linemen, the
true big 'uns, I phoned the Chicago Bears, my friendly,
neighborhood team.
   They couldn't find their rosters from 1958 or 1959, but
came up with one for 1960, which I thought was close enough.
It showed that Bear offensive linemen that year weighed an
average of 239 pounds, against 275 for members of last year's
squad. The biggest fella on the 1960 Chicago line weighed 255
pounds. The smallest of his 1989 counterparts tipped the
scales at 260.
   For the "faster-stronger" part, as well as an explanation
of what's behind the quantum-leap weight boost of the
linemen, et al., I spoke with Frank Katch, professor of
exercise science at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst. He's eminently qualified to comment on these
matters, having studied, and served as a fitness consultant
to, various NFL teams over the years.
   Katch had two things to say in preamble. One was that most
football players he knew were "real athletes," unlike some
others he could name. "I was in a group that studied the
Boston Red Sox baseball team in the early 1980s," he says. "I
was in my 40s, but I could do more situps than anyone on the
entire Sox pitching staff."
   His other view, expressed wryly, was that human evolution
has not advanced sufficiently in the last couple dozen years
to account for the football players' weight gains. "Intensive
weight lifting, increased food intake, and, in some cases,
steroid use, starting at the high school level, account for
it," says he.
   He adds: "I've heard about the steroid testing programs in
the colleges and pros, but I'm not convinced they're
effective. I'll believe it when I see the weight and strength
figures coming down."
   Katch's Exhibit A in the faster-stronger category is
Renaldo Turnbull, a 6-foot-5, 255-pound rookie outside
linebacker for the NFL New Orleans Saints, who, the professor
notes, isn't a steroid user as far as he knows. Before the
1990 draft, in which Turnbull was a first-round choice, Katch
subjected the former U. of West Virginia athlete to a number
of strength tests, including vertical leaps off of a
computerized force plate. He found Turnbull's performance to
be "off the charts" in comparison with past footballers.
   Then he weighed Turnbull in a water tank, and found his
"lean-body weight," defined as muscle and bone minus fat, to
be 225 pounds. That, he says, was four pounds heavier than
the average total weight of the seven linebackers from the
1979 Dallas Cowboys, who, incidentally, won the NFC's Eastern
Division title.
   "Ten years ago, there was no way anyone weighing 255
pounds could be an outside linebacker in the NFL," Katch
declares. "We're talking about an awesome change here -- it
would be like seeing a 6-foot-4 female gymnast. The explosive
power of guys like Turnbull is unprecedented."
   And that, in turn, brings us to the sad part, the wear and
tear caused by -- and to -- these bigger, stronger, faster
footballers. "Football has always been tough physically, but
the conditions of today's game are making it tougher," says
former player Ron Mix. "I'm afraid that a lot of the players
will be paying a price for their participation many years
down the road."
   Mix was an NFL offensive lineman for 12 seasons ending in
1971, and performed well enough to be elected to the league's
Hall of Fame. Now he's a San Diego lawyer, and part of his
practice is representing retired players in workmen's
compensation claims for athletics-related injuries. He
reports that 50% disabilities for things like back, hip,
knee, neck and shoulder injuries are common in the group, and
that total disability for physical work "isn't rare."
   And that might not be the worst of it. Mix, 52, says that
while there are insufficient numbers for proper statistics,
anecdotal information suggests that football veterans might
lose as many as 10 years off their normal life expectancies.
"Too many ex-players are dying in their 40s and 50s for it to
be accidental," he says. "It's pretty scary."
   He continues: "There's no mystery what's behind it. You've
got men who are too heavy for their bodies playing a
much-longer schedule than in the past, in hotter weather, and
on a lot of artificial turf, which is just a sheet of plastic
over concrete. And unless things have changed that I don't
know about, you've still got widespread steroid use, with all
its health dangers. It's not a good prescription for
longevity.
   "You can blame the clubs for creating the conditions, or
the players for allowing them," he concludes. "Either way,
it's nothing to cheer about."

   FTC, as Expected, Files Antitrust Claim
   Against ABC, College Football Group

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Trade Commission, in an
aggressive antitrust action, charged the College Football
Association and Capital Cities/ABC Inc. with illegally
restraining competition in a five-year exclusive broadcast
contract.
   In its administrative complaint, which was expected, the
commission alleged that the contract would hinder competition
in the marketing of football telecasts and deprive viewers of
a broader selection of games to watch.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At a news conference yesterday, FTC antitrust chief Kevin
Arquit said, "As a consequence of the contracts entered into
between ABC and the CFA, rights fees for college football
telecasts are higher, fewer games are telecast, overall
college football viewership is lower and even the selection
of games for telecast is not responsive to consumer
preference."
   The commission's complaint is the first of its sort
brought against a collegiate or professional sports
association, Mr. Arquit said. In a 1984 antitrust decision
stemming from a private lawsuit, the U.S. Supreme Court broke
up the National Collegiate Athletic Association's monopoly on
negotiating broadcast rights on behalf of all college teams.
   The CFA has denied any wrongdoing and said it would fight
the charges. But people familiar with the case said that
private negotiations are likely and could produce a
settlement prior to the Nov. 13 hearing scheduled before an
FTC administrative law judge.
   The FTC complaint threatens the nearly total dominance ABC
Sports would have beginning next year on national primetime
college football telecasts. In February, the CFA and Capital
Cities/ABC signed a contract, which the FTC valued at $300
million, committing 63 of the association's 66 member schools
to broadcast their Saturday afternoon games on the network
from 1991 through 1995. The FTC could seek to have the
contract voided and prohibit any other agreements that it
believes restrain broadcast competition.
   The FTC action is a product of the agency's campaign to
revive its relatively dormant antitrust bureau. During the
Reagan administration, a combination of anti-regulatory
ideology and a reduced staff crippled the commission's
antitrust efforts.
   About eight months ago, however, the FTC established a
nine-lawyer unit to scrutinize transactions that don't
involve mergers, Mr. Arquit said. The case announced
yesterday is the first from the new team to reach the
administrative complaint stage, he added.
   The CFA, which consists of most of the major collegiate
athletic conferences and 20 major independent universities,
has an exclusive broadcasting arrangement with CBS Inc. for
this year's season. Asked about the legality of that
contract, which the FTC hasn't formally challenged, Mr.
Arquit said he couldn't comment on any "possible pending
investigation."
   Capital Cities/ABC already has exclusive broadcast
contracts with the members of two major collegiate
conferences, the Big Ten and Pacific 10. Mr. Arquit also
declined to comment on the legality of those agreements.
   Lewis Engman, the CFA's lawyer, said that the association
"is not a cartel" and pointed out that "today there are
hundreds of college football games televised every season."
   An administrative complaint doesn't mean that the target
companies have acted illegally. The commission has the
authority to issue a complaint when it has "reason to
believe" that antitrust laws have been violated and that
further proceedings are "in the public interest," Mr. Arquit
said.
   The CFA and Capital Cities/ABC may appeal any ruling by
the administrative law judge to the FTC's five commissioners,
who may then reconsider the case.

   WASHINGTON -- The war of words between the U.S. and Iraq
escalated, as the administration condemned the shooting of an
American civilian by Iraqi soldiers and President Bush
accepted an offer to appear on Iraqi television.
   Meanwhile, more Americans left Iraq and Iraqi-controlled
Kuwait. A small group of Americans left on a
Canadian-chartered airplane for Turkey, and an
Iraqi-chartered flight for U.S. citizens is scheduled to
depart today, according to the State Department.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A State Department official said Iraqi authorities have
given the U.S. "reason to believe this will not be the only
flight allowed." He said the flights probably would be
limited to women and children.
   Mark Dillen, a State Department spokesman said, "We plan
to continue this procedure as long as we have U.S. citizens
who want to leave Iraq and Kuwait." He said more than 150
U.S. citizens have departed Iraq by chartered flights.
   At the same time, U.S. efforts to get European allies to
pay the costs of the Persian Gulf crisis made some headway,
but not as much as U.S. officials would like. Foreign
ministers of the 12 European Community nations, meeting
tomorrow in Rome, are expected to approve tentatively aid to
Jordan, Turkey and Egypt, the nations hit hardest by the
embargo on trade with Iraq. But it's far less certain that
the Europeans will contribute cash to defray the costs of the
U.S. deployment of troops and planes to Saudi Arabia.
   For the first time in the confrontation with Iraq, the
administration is having to formulate a response to Iraqi
violence against an American. The State Department confirmed
initial reports that the man, who wasn't identified, was shot
in the forearm as he climbed from the window of his apartment
in Kuwait City in an effort to evade Iraqi soldiers.
   Mr. Dillen, called the shooting "outrageous behavior." He
reiterated that the administration will "hold the Iraqi
government responsible for the health and welfare of all
American citizens held against their will in Kuwait and
Iraq." He declined to "speculate about any future response"
from the U.S. to the incident.
   The State Department summoned Iraq's ambassador to the
U.S. to protest the shooting. The U.S. also demanded the
return of the body of a U.S. citizen who died of a heart
attack last month. The man had been held by Iraq as a
"shield" at one of its military facilities. U.S. officials
also urged Iraq to permit the man who was wounded to depart.
   The U.S. learned of the shooting, Mr. Dillen said, from a
U.S. friend of the wounded man. He said Iraqi officials told
the U.S. that "the injury is not serious" and that the man
would be released from the hospital within 24 hours.
   The Iraqi officials said the man will remain in custody
after being transferred to Baghdad. Mr. Dillen said that the
U.S. expects American diplomats will be able to see the man
at that time.
   The U.S. is concerned about reports that Iraqi soldiers
are using live ammunition in their efforts to round up
foreigners, tactics that could spark more violence. Mr.
Dillen called the reports "extremely disturbing, and yet
another indication of the lengths to which the Iraqis are
willing to go to carry out their inhumane policy of using
innocent foreigners as shields while denying them the right
to leave."
   In the battle of the airwaves, the U.S. moved to try to
gain advantage over Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Iraqi
officials, apparently in response to assertions they aren't
letting the Iraqi people know about the international
response to the invasion of Kuwait, offered to send an Iraqi
television crew to Washington to interview Mr. Bush and to
run the interview on national television.
   The White House has been peeved at the extensive air time
U.S. televison networks have given to Saddam Hussein and
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. President Bush rejected
the interview offer but said he would send a taped message to
Iraq.
   "Although we have not heard from Iraq directly, we accept
their offer of a broadcast to the Iraqi people," said
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. "The president
will tape a message to the Iraqi people in the next few days,
which will be provided to the Iraqi information minister."
   Mr. Fitzwater, who said the message will run 10 to 15
minutes, declared: "We assume the offer means they will
broadcast the message in its entirety." To bar any tampering
with it, the White House plans to make it available here.
It's unclear whether Iraq will run the tape.
   In the propaganda war, Saddam Hussein has portrayed
himself as a reasonable leader under seige by the U.S. The
U.S. administration has portrayed the situation as a
confrontation between Iraqi aggressors and the international
community.
   The U.S. is stitching together an international campaign,
but it's not clear if it will be broad enough to satisfy U.S.
lawmakers who want other nations to bear more of the load.
European nations are trying to decide on the final amount of
aid each will offer to nations hurt by the embargo against
Iraqi trade. The U.S. has suggested that EC nations
contribute a total of as much as $2.5 billion in immediate,
short-term support to be divided among Jordan, Turkey and
Egypt. The U.S. estimates those nations will need a total of
$10.5 billion in aid this year and next.
   European officials aren't sure they should make cash
contributions to the U.S. military effort, as U.S. officials
want. The Europeans point to the growing fleet of European
naval vessels in the Persian Gulf to help enforce the embargo
against Iraq, as well as some French ground troops in the
United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, as a substantial
contribution.

   Firms' Junk Bond Defaults
   Totaling $9.4 Billion in '90

   NEW YORK -- Corporations that issued junk bonds have
defaulted on $9.4 billion principal amount of the securities
so far this year, up from $8.8 billion for all of last year.
   Those figures are among the findings in a Salomon Brothers
Inc. junk bond default study that was released yesterday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The study includes all non-convertible securities issued
in the past 13 years.
   Salomon said that this year's defaults bring the
cumulative principal amount of high-yield defaults and
troubled exchange offers since Jan. 1, 1977 to $27.8 billion.
   The investment firm estimated that through the end of June
1990, defaults have resulted in a $16.4 billion cumulative
loss in principal and interest payments to bondholders.
   The retail industry had the largest number of troubled
issues and accounted for 18.2% of all junk bond defaults
between January 1977 and Aug. 15, 1990. In addition, 35% of
all junk bonds issued by retailers have defaulted during the
13-year period studied.
   The oil and gas industry had the second-largest percentage
of defaults and represented 10.6% of total defaults since
1977, with most of the defaults occuring between 1984 and
1986.
   The study considers a bond in default if the issuer failed
to make a scheduled interest payment before the expiration of
a "grace period" or if the issuer filed for bankruptcy court
protection under Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 of the federal
bankruptcy code.
   The average weighted annual default rate as of Aug. 15 was
3.79% of the total value of outstanding junk bonds, which are
high-yield speculative grade corporate bonds that have low
credit ratings or no credit rating at all.

   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- United Gaming Inc. reported substantial
profit declines for the fiscal fourth quarter and year, and
said it named two new senior executives as part of the
expansion of its casino and gaming-machine route businesses.
   For the fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, the company
reported net income of $72,000, or one cent a share, compared
with $1,449,000, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
was $25,894,000, vs. $18,010,000 a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The quarter included $1,665,000 in charges that stemmed
from several unexpected events, including a customer's
involuntary bankruptcy filing that resulted in a charge of
$667,000 and the withdrawal from another casino project that
resulted in a charge of $630,000. The company also scrapped a
planned public financing because of poor market conditions.
   For fiscal 1990, the company posted net of $3,895,000, or
45 cents a share, vs. $5,779,000 or 70 cents a share for the
prior fiscal year. Revenues was $90,205,000 compared with
$65,389,000 a year earlier. The company said it expects 1991
fiscal firstquarter results to be affected by lower revenue
at one casino that is being remodeled, employee severance
costs, and the elimination of some stops on its gamingmachine
route.
   Also, Carole A. Carter, vice president, was named
president and chief operating officer. She succeeds David A.
Scheinman as president, who remains a director and
consultant. John W. Alderfer, former chief financial officer
of the Bicycle Club in Los Angeles, was named vice president
of finance and chief financial officer. He succeeds Robert E.
Huggins, who continues to head operations at the Plantation
and Mizpah sites.

   Arco Unveils Gasoline
   For California Market
   That Burns Cleaner

   LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co. introduced a
cleaner-burning high-octane gasoline that will replace its
current premium unleaded gasoline in Southern California.
   On a hot, smoggy day at a local gasoline station, Arco
Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook ceremoniously unveiled what the
company calls "EC-Premium," which the station was selling for
$1.359 a gallon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   EC-Premium follows the introduction a year ago of EC-1, a
form of emission-control regular gasoline intended for
pre-1975 cars and pre-1980 trucks. As for unleaded regular,
which represents 60% of Arco's gasoline sales, Mr. Cook said
that it would take four to five years to bring out a
reformulated version, would cost the company about $2 billion
and "depends what the government mandates." Tough new
California regulations and federal legislation are pending.
   Mr. Cook said the new gasoline was costing the company
four cents a gallon more to produce, but he said wholesale
prices would not be increased "in the immediate future"
except to reflect increases in crude prices. He said Arco
hoped to make up the difference by increasing market share.
He said the cost of developing EC-Premium and bringing it to
market was "a few million" because it didn't require major
changes in the refining process.
   EC-Premium reduces benzene emissions by about 55%,
compared with its old unleaded premium, the company said, and
is also lower in aromatics, olefins and evaporative pressure.
Like EC-1, the new gasoline will be sold at stations from
Santa Barbara to the Mexican border, and east to the Arizona
state line. Sales of leaded regular gasoline have increased
3% since EC-1 was introduced, even though the customer base
of cars and trucks without catalytic converters has been
shrinking through attrition.

   Chase Laboratories
   Begins Generic Sales

   NEWARK, N.J. -- Chase Laboratories Inc. said it began
selling the first generic version of Pfizer Inc.'s
big-selling heart medicine, Procardia.
   The action is expected to slice away some sales from one
of Pfizer's most profitable products. But analysts said
damage to Pfizer's Procardia business will be muted by
marketing techniques undertaken by the big New York-based
drug company. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, Pfizer shares fell $1.75 to $69.375.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chase, owned by closely held Andlinger &amp; Co. of Tarrytown,
N.Y., said it began selling yesterday a version of the drug
that is 30% to 40% less expensive than the brand sold by
Pfizer. Chase won the right to sell the generic version of
the drug, also known as nifedipine, following a protracted
legal battle with Pfizer over the validity of a nifedipine
patent that expired in 1989.
   Under terms of the legal settlement filed in federal court
in Newark, Chase will be the only company allowed to sell a
generic version of Procardia until Jan. 8, 1991. At that time
another patent covering Procardia will expire and other
generic drug companies will begin selling versions of the
drug.
   Procardia had sales of about $420 million in 1989. But
last year Pfizer began marketing Procardia XL, which the
company markets as safer, more effective and less expensive
than Procardia. Mark Mayer, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, said Procardia XL sales may rise to $300 million
this year as doctors switch from Procardia.
   Chase officials said they expect to generate sales of $20
million to $25 million in 1990 selling their brand of
Procardia, but analysts said competition from other generic
products and from Procardia XL may sharply reduce Chase's
nifedipine revenue in 1991.

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it will shut the
assembly plant that builds the Buick Reatta for an additional
two weeks because of slow sales. The plant was to have
reopened this past Tuesday after a seven week shutdown. About
600 workers will be laid off temporarily.
   As of July 31, GM had a 97-day supply of Reatta cars,
according to Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade journal. This
level is considerably higher than the 65-to-70 day range
regarded as optimal.

   Overall, the 10 major domestic auto makers planned to
build 111,612 cars this week, up 2.8% from 108,575 made a
year ago.
   Ford Motor Co. said it scheduled Saturday overtime at its
truck plants in Kansas City, Mo., St. Louis, Mo., and
Louisville, Ky.
   Chrysler Corp. said its assembly plant in Newark, Del., is
scheduled to work Saturday overtime.
