   Economy:
   Consumer Spending Rose Scant 0.1%,
   Income Edged Up 0.3% in November

   WASHINGTON -- Consumer spending barely climbed in November
as personal incomes increased only slightly, suggesting that
consumers have hunkered down and won't contribute to economic
strength in the next few months.
   The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending
increased only 0.1% in November to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $3.727 trillion, after remaining flat in
October. Personal income rose a scant 0.3% last month, to a
rate of $4.711 trillion, also after no gain in October. The
department said that almost all of the November increase in
personal income came from higher federal subsidy payments to
farmers.

<TEXT>
   "We are seeing a real retrenchment of the consumer," said
John Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services in
Chicago. Many economists have pointed in recent weeks to
growing consumer fears about the economy as a key factor in
the slowdown in consumer spending. But the report for
November suggested that laggard growth in incomes also is
holding back spending.
   Even more striking, consumer spending after adjustment for
inflation fell 0.2% in November after dropping 0.8% in
October. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of
gross national product -- the nation's output of goods and
services. The recent declines in spending could subtract more
than two percentage points from the inflation-adjusted GNP
growth rate in the fourth quarter, said Michael Penzer, an
economist for San Francisco-based Bank of America.
   The vast majority of economists agree that GNP likely will
shrink in the fourth quarter; estimates of the contraction
range from about 1% to 4% at an annual rate.
   Moreover, the report suggested spending probably won't
climb for at least a few months because real disposable
income -- after-tax income adjusted for inflation -- has
stagnated. This measure of income was flat in November,
following decreases of 0.8% in October and 0.3% in September.
So far, disposable income is falling at a 4.6% annual rate in
the fourth quarter, Mr. Penzer said.
   "There just isn't the income there to support spending,"
he said. "Real disposable income is falling off a cliff. It's
likely to hit first-quarter spending as well."
   The savings rate -- savings as a ratio of disposable
personal income -- totaled 4% in November, compared with 3.7%
in October and 3.8% in September. The rate is still at
relatively low levels compared with the last decade. In the
early years of the 1980s, it hovered around 7%. Last year,
the savings rate was 4.6%.
   Consumer spending on durable goods -- goods intended to
last more than three years -- fell 1.9% after a 2.6% drop in
October. Spending on nondurables was up 0.5% in November,
following a 0.2% rise the previous month. Spending on
services increased 0.3% after a 0.5% gain.
   Wage and salary income decreased a slight 0.1% in November
to a $2.728 trillion annual rate. Manufacturing wages fell
1.7% to a $540.3 billion rate, and wages in
commodity-producing industries dropped 1.5% to a $719.6
billion rate.
                                                                                                       

   Here is the Commerce Department's latest report on
personal income. The figures are at seasonally adjusted
annual rates in trillions of dollars.

   Borland Jazzes Up
   Christmas Presents
   With Gifts of Music

   Chief Executive/Jazz Player
   Recorded CD for Clients;
   Claims `No Time' for Tour

   Chief executives officers, from Lee Iacocca to John
Sculley, have written books to burnish their images. Now,
there's a new twist on such hype-releasing music albums.
   In the spirit of Christmas, Borland International Inc.,
one of the largest suppliers of software for personal
computers, has just released a compact disk containing 72
minutes of music recorded by Philippe Kahn, Borland's chief,
and a group of well-known jazz musicians.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Indeed, Mr. Kahn says the album, called "Pacific High,"
turned out so well that listeners are urging him to go on
tour with his studio-group, which includes guitarist John
Abercrombie, drummer Billy Hart and saxophonist David
Liebman. All three are widely recorded musicians.
   "I don't think I have the time for a tour," says Mr. Kahn,
a mathematician by training, who sees parallels between
writing computer software and playing music.
   "It took a lot of guts for him to stand up in the same
studio with musicians of such accomplishment," says Ron
McClure, bassist on the recording and a popular jazzman
himself.
   And while it isn't likely Mr. Kahn, who plays the flute
and various saxophones, will win a Grammy for his effort, the
critics aren't snickering either. "I thought (Mr. Kahn's)
playing was very good," says Jamey Aebersold, a noted jazz
instructor. "I like the variety of the music too, and his
choice of musicians is superb."
   Mr. Kahn says he's wanted to record a jazz album for
years, and did so this August -- at Borland's expense --
after deciding to break with the practice of giving customers
a bottle of wine for Christmas and issue his album instead.
   "We spent much less money" on this album than the
traditional Christmas gifts, Mr. Kahn says, even with the
costs of paying musicians and a recording studio. Moreover,
he insists that he isn't simply "using Borland for
self-promotion," but hopes to distribute the CD commercially
and donate the proceeds to AIDS research.
   The French-born Mr. Kahn often does the unorthodox. He
founded Borland, which is based in Scotts Valley, Calif.,
while still an illegal alien. Successfully thwarting
Immigration and Naturalization Service efforts to deport him,
he turned the company into a software powerhouse.
   Mr. Kahn has gigged casually for years, often taking time
during his frequent travels to practice in hotel stairways.

   ELK GROVE VILLAGE, Ill. -- AAR Corp., hit by the hard
times plaguing its airline customers, said earnings for its
second quarter ended Nov. 30 plunged 98%, despite an 11%
increase in revenue.
   The supplier of aviation services and parts reported net
income of just $126,000, or one cent a share, compared with
the year-earlier period's $6.8 million, or 42 cents a share.
Sales rose to $115.8 million from $104.6 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   AAR makes and overhauls aircraft parts, and performs
aircraft maintenance for a number of airlines in the U.S. and
abroad. The latest period's results were pulled down in part
by a $3.3 million pretax charge that reflects how the airline
industry's problems have rippled outward to affect industry
suppliers.
   Included in the provision is $1.9 million to cover an
underutilized division's restructuring, a $1 million reserve
established against receivables due from an airline customer
that recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, AAR shares were up 50 cents at $10.125. AAR shares
moved down sharply earlier last week, when the company
disclosed the second-quarter results on a preliminary basis.
   AAR had said the decision to downsize its major airline
airframe maintenance division in Oklahoma City "follows a
weakening demand for scheduled maintenance checks for major
airline aircraft. . . . Without sufficient prospects for full
utilization of existing resources, the company concluded that
(the division's) restructuring was necessary."
   The company said it will continue to "aggressively market"
various other types of service work on major airline
aircraft, and for all types of maintenance for regional and
business aircraft. These businesses, it said, have "typically
been less subject to downturns in the marketplace."

   Computers:
   Shoppers Shun
   New Home PCs
   Despite Ad Blitz

   Home computer buyers have long proved an elusive target.
That hasn't changed this Christmas.
   Only a few months ago, makers of personal computers were
predicting a boom in home computer sales, thanks to a new
generation of low-cost, easy-to-use machines.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. rolled out its new
PS/1 home computer nationwide in the fourth quarter and said
it hoped to sell 200,000 units world-wide during the rest of
the year. The computer giant signed up big mass merchants
Sears and Dillard, along with its regular dealers, to sell
the PS/1. And it backed the machines with millions of dollars
worth of consumer advertising.
   Unfortunately, as the end of this crucial first Christmas
selling season nears, the returns aren't good. According to
analysts, dealers and others who track computer sales, IBM is
expected to sell between 50,000 and 60,000 PS/1s in the U.S.
this quarter and less than that overseas. Sales of Tandy
Corp.'s 1000 RL, another contestant in the home market, are
expected to wind up in that same range, despite an expensive
ad blitz and the marketing clout of the company's 7,000 Radio
Shack dealers. With dealers saying that supplies of the
machine are plentiful, Tandy has started discounting the $750
to $1,300 1000 RL by as much as $200, depending on the model.
   "This is not a home computer Christmas," says Tim Bajarin,
executive vice president of Creative Strategies
International, a market research firm. "These are not
impressive numbers."
   Analysts blame the shortfall on a combination of poor
planning and bad economic timing. Computer makers seem to
have misidentified the type of person who needs a computer at
home, analysts say. They focused on selling simple-minded
machines that store recipes to technological novices. But
those people won't spend $1,000 on a computer. The people who
need computers at home are professionals who do some or all
of their work there. But they need more powerful machines.
   Even if the average person had an interest in owning a
computer, analysts say, they would be unlikely to respond to
computer makers' pitches. "You don't sell clothes to fat
ladies by showing fat ladies in clothes, and you don't sell
computers to beginners by dumbing down the machines," says
Esther Dyson, editor and publisher of Release 1.0, a
newsletter.
   In addition to making these mistakes, computer makers are
suffering from the gloomy U.S. economic climate. With fears
mounting over a war in the Persian Gulf and a recession at
home, sales of home computers, which cost from $750 to
$2,000, are suffering along with other big-ticket items this
Christmas.
   IBM and Tandy don't take as dim a view as the analysts.
While IBM refuses to comment on current sales estimates, it
points out that a last-minute buying frenzy before Christmas
could change the outlook sharply. Meanwhile, Tandy's vice
president of marketing, Lowell C. Duncan Jr., insists the
1000 RL is a resounding success for Radio Shack, calling
analysts' expectations "wildly unrealistic."
   The one company that seems to have sold a significant
number of machines in this low-priced category is the one
that insists it hasn't targeted the home market. Indeed,
analysts say, Apple Computer Inc.'s more-powerful Macintosh
Classic has been selling quite successfully, shipping well
over 100,000 units since its October introduction, with a
backlog of at least that many machines. While schools and
small businesses have purchased the majority, an estimated
one-third to one-half of the machines have been purchased by
people intending to use them at home, analysts say.
   Don Zuckerman, a sales manager in Plano, Texas, says he
bought a Classic for his office and lugs it home to do work
on the weekends. He says that he considered the PS/1 and 1000
RL but opted for the more powerful Classic.
   That seems to be a common decision for computer shoppers.
Analysts say IBM is selling far more of its more advanced,
$2,000 versions of the PS/1 than of its $1,000 beginner
model. Tandy dealers echo that theme. "I have a lot of people
come in for the RL and move up to a better machine," says
Libby Bovent, the owner of a franchised Radio Shack store in
Hermiston, Ore.
   That phenomenon, analysts insist, provides proof that
people buying computers for home use aren't necessarily
looking for the inexpensive machines that sacrifice power and
capabilities; they're buying them to work at home. Indeed,
the number of work-at-home PCs is expected to grow from about
10 million in 1989 to almost 19 million by 1991, says Link
Resources Corp., a market research firm.
   Because of that, analysts predict that computer makers
will be forced to adapt their new machines to this more
demanding market. IBM, for example, is expected to beef up
its PS/1 with more memory and a bigger hard disk, making it
more like the more expensive PS/2. The company wouldn't
comment.
   But the lowball sales estimates this Christmas raise the
specter of past failures for computer makers on the home
front. IBM withdrew from an earlier effort in the mid-1980s
after selling only 500,000 of its underpowered PCjrs. Texas
Instruments Inc. absorbed a painful $624 million writeoff
when it dropped its 99/4A home machine back in 1983.
   But the possibilities keep luring PC makers, who reason
that their markets would expand exponentially if they could
just find a machine that could convert all those technophobes
determined to sit out the computer revolution.
   Unfortunately, the technology dropouts continue to be a
tough crowd to sway. Robert Weis, a human services
professional from Hercules, Calif., isn't dropping hints to
loved ones about a computer this year. "I've seen the ads and
I've ignored them," he says adamantly. "I have no use for a
computer, and I don't understand them. I haven't even
mastered my VCR yet."

   SHEVARDNADZE RESIGNED as foreign minister of the Soviet
Union.
   In an emotional speech to Soviet legislators, Shevardnadze
denounced the political right wing and warned of a new
dictatorship taking shape. His departure deprives Gorbachev
of one of his closest and most liberal allies and dashes the
president's hopes of quickly forging a consensus to deal with
the nation's social and economic crisis.

   Shevardnadze had played a crucial role in helping to end
the Cold War and to establish a cooperative relationship with
the U.S. In his speech yesterday, he attacked attempts by
some deputies at the congress to forbid the sending of Soviet
troops to the Persian Gulf.
   Despite the gloating of hard-liners, most Soviet lawmakers
were dismayed by the resignation. Some said they believe the
nation is at a crossroads, with Gorbachev's restructuring
policy, and perhaps even his own job, at stake.

   The White House budget office wants to pare Medicare
spending next fiscal year by nearly $3 billion beyond the
cuts stipulated in this fall's deficit-reduction accord with
Congress. The new cuts would result from reducing
reimbursements to hospitals and doctors, not from making
beneficiaries pay more, officials said.

   Two research groups found that inheriting specific, but

genes are damaged.

   La-Z-Boy Expects
   Period Net to Meet
   Year-Ago Levels

   MONROE, Mich. -- Despite a recent drop in orders, La-Z-Boy
Chair Co. expects to match last year's profit of $6.1
million, or 34 cents a share, for its third quarter ending in
January, said Treasurer Gene M. Hardy.
   However, Mr. Hardy is expecting a profit "slippage" in the
fourth quarter and Chairman Charles T. Knabusch said it is
unlikely the dividend will be increased this fiscal year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The order rate for the company's products dropped about
four weeks ago but company officials are expecting it to
bounce back in January. If that doesn't happen, the company's
earnings could fall 10% or 15% below analysts' predictions of
a profit of $25 million, or $1.40 a share, for the current
fiscal year ending in April, Mr. Knabusch said. If orders do
bounce back, he expects to meet analysts' expectations.
   In the last fiscal year, La-Z-Boy earned $28.3 million, or
$1.58 a share. Mr. Hardy said it was now "out of the
question" that the company would match these profits. This
would be the first time the company hadn't increased its
annual profits since 1985.
   La-Z-Boy posted a profit of $8.8 million, or 49 cents a
share, in the six months ending Oct. 27. That was down from
year-earlier profit of $11.1 million, or 62 cents a share.
The big drop stemmed largely from one-time costs in the first
quarter to expand and improve several plants, company
officials said.
   The company, which last boosted its dividend in September
1989 to 14 cents a quarter, has traditionally raised its
dividend every "four or five quarters," Mr. Knabusch said.
But he said a dividend increase this year was unlikely if the
company's profit falls short of last year's, as expected.
   La-Z-Boy, which has a 30% share of the reclining chair
market, expects revenue of roughly $620 million in the
current fiscal year, up from $592 million last year. In
recent years, La-Z-Boy has branched out into bedroom sets and
other hardwood furniture through acquisitions.
   However, these new lines of furniture have been harder hit
by the economic slowdown than reclining chairs. In addition,
La-Z-Boy had to take on nearly $50 million in debt to finance
its 1988 purchase of Kincaid Furniture Co. in Hudson, N.C.
The company has since paid down that debt to about $40
million.
   La-Z-Boy's capital spending is expected to drop to between
$13 million and $15 million in the next fiscal year from
about $22 million in the current year, Mr. Hardy said.
   The company expects hardwood furniture sales will rise
faster than its reclining chair sales in an improving
economy.

   European Community's Recent Actions
   Contradict Plans for Economic Unity

   LONDON -- Beyond the recent rhetoric, the European
Community looks less like an international trade bloc than a
block to international trade.
   With Europe's magic 1992 date for unity about to draw
another year closer, this is the time when steps towards a
liberated, open marketplace of 320 million consumers should
be increasingly apparent. In Rome recently, the heads of the
EC's 12 national governments looked beyond reality to an even
more lofty and distant goal for the future: creating a
bustling political federation with a single currency and
monetary policy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the EC's actions have been counter to the
freer-markets and deregulation goals at the nucleus of the
1992 project. This unfortunate development is the source of
increasing worry for thousands of companies -- especially
American and Japanese multinationals -- that hope to expand
in an increasingly open Europe.
   As the politicians embellish lofty visions, Europe slipped
backward into old habits of increasing state control of the
economy, clubbish cronyism and egotistical self-obsession.
   Several recent business examples highlight the trend. They
come against the backdrop of the recent failure of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to make important
changes that would have further reduced commercial barriers
in over 100 countries.
   The EC caused the breakdown by insisting on protecting its
farmers and failing to grapple with its money-losing -- and
eventually unaffordable -- state subsidies for agriculture.
   The stakes resulting from such indifference run high.
Carla Hills, U.S. trade representative, told a conference of
American state legislators that the kind of global
cooperation shown in the Persian Gulf crisis might not be
possible in the future.
   Many of Europe's savviest businessmen realize that this
protectionist bent -- if continued -- could boomerang and
jeopardize Europe's unprecedented post-World War II economic
prosperity as well.
   Consider Air France's ability to acquire control of 97% of
the domestic airline market, apparently proving that
monopolies are going to fly high in the friendly skies of the
new Europe. Earlier this year, the state-owned French airline
agreed to buy its main private-sector competitor L'Union des
Transports Aeriens. The deal also gave Air France control of
the nation's main domestic carrier, UTA's 36%-owned Air Inter
unit.
   One might think that Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's antitrust
commissioner, would scupper such a flagrant violation of EC
rules, ensuring more-open access to markets. He tried -- sort
of. Though some EC commissioners agreed the Air France
transaction appeared to run counter to EC antitrust rules,
Air France has managed to get its way in return for some
promised route concessions.
   Why? Because in Europe, what counts isn't what you say to
but whom you know. In Air France's case, political power
trumped liberal economic principles. Air France's chairman is
Bernard Attali, brother of trusted Mitterrand government
adviser Jacques -- himself the head of the new Bank for
European Reconstruction &amp; Development. And EC Commission
President Jacques Delors, whom many believe hopes to become
France's next president, also backed the deal.
   Italy is increasing state control of the economy and
industry. And thus far, anyway, Brussels doesn't seem to have
raised a peep of protest.
   Last month, the government acquired control of chemical
giant Enimont S.p.A. for an estimated $2.7 billion from its
private-sector owners -- thus increasing the state's
already-important role in industry. For an EC that's supposed
to be concerned about state subsidies, its inability to do
anything in the Enimont saga is a cautionary tale.
   Enimont was supposed to marry the public-sector muscle of
state-owned energy company Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi and the
private-sector entrepreneurship of high-flying businessman
Raul Gardini, head of the Ferruzzi financial and agriculture
empire. Instead, the venture quickly fell apart in a dispute
over goals and tactics.
   Mr. Gardini accepted the Italian government's offer to buy
his 40% stake. The deal leaves the Italian government less
likely to succeed in its plan to create a fast-footed
national chemicals champion able to compete in the global
market.
   As a result of such situations, London stockbrokers UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew expect Italy to fall short of its
once-upon-a-time target of six trillion lira in
privatizations this year and next.
   Also last month, the EC Commission -- despite Sir Leon's
objections -- cleared the merger of two big Dutch coffee
makers. The decision exposes the biggest loophole in
Brussels' merger-control plans: National governments can
still trump the EC when they feel their so-called national
interest at stake.
   For the Dutch, coffee is the national interest. At issue
was Douwe Egberts, a Sara Lee unit, combination with rival
Van Nelle, which gave the firms 70% of the Benelux coffee
market. Never mind, the EC commissioners from Holland and
Belgium argued when the EC Commission initially objected to
the deal: This matters primarily in our home markets, and our
local arbiters should decide. Though the market is small, the
decision underscored the fact that politics, not economics,
at times is running the merger-control process. That raises
some worrying questions in the minds of EC merger
practitioners.
   Such examples may be just a taste of what's to come. For
example, the European auto industry -- pushed largely by such
firms as Peugeot -- seems headed for further restrictions of
Japanese competition through voluntary quotas. And would
Airbus Industrie be such an increasingly potent commercial
rival to Boeing Co. if its heavy government subsidies were
suddenly stopped?
   But initial enthusiasm is giving way to dangerous habits.
Unless Europe takes its head out of the clouds, and puts its
feet on the ground it is on the road to becoming a fortress
to block trade, instead of a trade bloc.

   Revlon's Junk Debt
   Of $828 Million
   Is Downgraded

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Ronald O. Perelman's debt-laden holdings
sustained a blow yesterday when Moody's Investor Service Inc.
downgraded the ratings of $828 million of junk bonds at two
of his companies.
   Affected was the subordinated debt of holding company
Revlon Group Inc., which was downgraded to Caa from
single-B-3. Moody's also downgraded Revlon Inc.'s senior debt
to single-B-2 from single-B-1.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In part, the move was prompted by Revlon's lack of
financial flexibility at a time when the U.S. economy is
weakening, and competition is increasing in global beauty
care and cosmetics, according to the rating service. But
Moody's also attributed the action to the probability that
the company's debt will need to be refinanced beginning in
1992, and further access to the credit markets will be
restricted by the covenants of the company's bank loans.
   Mr. Perelman has operated Revlon with a heavy debt load
since he acquired the cosmetics maker in a hostile takeover
in 1985. A series of asset sales have reduced that debt
somewhat, although the closely held company isn't required to
report the debt of Revlon Group. Moody's said it believed
additional asset sales could result in lower margins and cut
into cash flow.
   A Revlon Group spokesman said an agreement that it made
earlier this year to restructure a $1.8 billion bank loan
required certain asset sales. He added that the company has
identified several assets, including a flavorings company and
real-estate holdings, that could be sold without reducing the
company's cash flow.
   Junk bond analysts said they weren't surprised by Moody's
action, and the prices of Revlon's bonds weren't affected by
the announcement. "Nobody is happy to see it, but it wasn't a
shock," says one high-yield analyst.
   Moody's confirmed the single-B-3 rating for the
subordinated debt of Revlon Inc., as well as the not-prime
rating for its commercial paper.

   Pertamina, Under Revised Plan, to Own
   Petrochemical Plant Slated in Indonesia

   JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Plans for another in a series of big
Indonesian petrochemical projects should fall in place by the
end of the year. But the ownership of this one has turned out
far different than originally planned: Private investors,
including a son of President Suharto, won't have a role.
   Initially, the project was structured as a $916 million
investment that would have included an equity interest held
by Humpuss Group, controlled by Hutomo Mandala Putra, the
youngest of Mr. Suharto's three sons. However, Humpuss
dropped plans to invest with a unit of Thyssen AG of Germany
and M.W. Kellogg Co. of the U.S. in the large upstream
aromatics plant in Sumatra. Instead, Pertamina, the state oil
company, will be sole owner of a scaled-down version of the
plant, on which construction is likely to begin in early
1991.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Humpuss and the other private investors gave up on their
project when they couldn't secure sufficient support from
Pertamina. Earlier this year, the oil company told the
private investors it could guarantee only about half the
volume of feedstock they were seeking, making their aromatics
plan financially unfeasible. Aromatics are chemicals derived
from oil and gas and processed to make fibers, detergents and
other end-products.
   Humpuss distributes one petrochemical for Pertamina, but
has been looking to invest in production. It will do so soon,
though not in nearly as big a fashion as it had hoped: Under
an agreement announced in late October, it will be a partner
in a $200 million venture to use paraxylene supplied by the
aromatics plant to produce purified terepththalic acid, or
PTA, which is used to make synthetic fiber for the textile
industry.
   If current plans proceed, all three of Mr. Suharto's sons
will have a role in Indonesia's petrochemical industry. Sigit
Harjojudanto, the eldest, has a personal stake with a unit of
British Petroleum Co. in a $400 million plant being built to
make polyethylene. Bambang Trihatmodjo, the second son,
expects his Bimantara Citra Group to sign a joint-venture
with foreign concerns led by Royal/Dutch Shell Group for a
$1.7 billion olefins center.
   The inability of the private aromatics venture to proceed
surprised many Jakarta businessmen, who had assumed that with
politically well-connected Humpuss as a partner, the
consortium could get any government assistance it needed.
Some business analysts speculate that Pertamina withheld the
volume of feedstock requested because it didn't want private
investors to control an upstream project.
   Kartiyoso, Pertamina's deputy director for processing,
disagrees. The state oil company was unable to meet the
private investors' request because of changing projections of
total demand for Pertamina's feedstock supply and its
long-term availability, he says. "They started with a very
big project," he says of the private investors. "It's not
viable from our point of view."
   Had it gone ahead, the Humpuss consortium's project would
have become the world's second-largest benzene producer.
"This would have projected Humpuss on the aromatics map,"
says Hasan Soedjono, assistant to the chairman, Mr. Hutomo.
   On the decision to drop the venture, Mr. Hasan says,
"Initially, we thought we had the feedstock. We were wrong."
He describes the change away from a private venture as "`New
Order' pragmatism at work." The New Order is the name
Indonesians give to the government established by Mr. Suharto
in 1966.
   Pertamina already has delivered a letter of intent to a
consortium of Mitsui &amp; Co. and Chiyoda Corp. of Japan and the
Thyssen unit that was to have a stake in the private project
to build the plant, for $700 million, in Sumatra. A
construction contract is expected to be signed before the end
of the year.
   For bankers, the switch to state control of the aromatics
project is also a pragmatic one. A Jakarta-based Japanese
banker says there were "too many problems" in arranging
financing for a private aromatics venture, but with the
proposed plant now belonging to Pertamina, "there's no
problem."
   Pertamina plans to obtain financing for the project on a
non-recourse basis, meaning the state oil company won't be
the borrower and the lenders won't have the right to seize
assets if loans aren't repaid. The borrower likely will be a
new offshore company that services project debt from cash
flow it receives through guaranteed long-term supplies of the
plant's output.
   Even though Pertamina won't be directly liable for loans
related to the project, its ownership of the plant will
comfort bankers. Non-recourse financing will allow Pertamina
to build the plant without adding to the Indonesian
government's large foreign debt -- now more than $35 billion
-- while lenders will regard financing for the project as
being nearly as safe as a sovereign loan.
   Hirotoshi Yokote, Mitsui's manager for development in
Jakarta, says the mechanism of the non-recourse financing for
the aromatics plant will be "quite complicated," but still
"workable."
   In the early 1980s, Pertamina planned to build its own
aromatics plant. But in 1983, the project was shelved along
with other state projects because of financial difficulties.
Lacking funding, Pertamina later indicated that private
investors could undertake the investment.
   In March 1988, Humpuss and Thyssen Rheinstahl Technik
G.m.b.H. won approval from Indonesia's investment board to
invest $916 million in an aromatics venture and Pertamina
agreed to supply the needed condensate.
   Condensate is a byproduct of the natural gas exported from
Sumatra in liquefied form.
   Under tentative plans, Humpuss was to hold 30%, and the
Thyssen unit was to hold 35%. They brought in Kellogg, with
another 35%, and there were plans for giving Pertamina a
nominal share. However, negotiations on the venture bogged
down earlier this year when Pertamina said it could guarantee
feedstock supplies of only about 40,000 barrels of condensate
a day, compared with the 90,000 barrels a day that Humpuss
and its partners were seeking.
   The reduced supply meant the size of the project would
have to be scaled down drastically, making it difficult to
win financial support.
   Thyssen Rheinstahl, the proposed main contractor, began
repackaging the plant to be owned by Pertamina and financed
through non-recourse loans. Japanese banks and trading
companies appeared hopeful of playing a role in exporting the
plant's output.
   Plans to recast the project on a smaller scale eventually
jelled. The plant will use about 45,000 barrels a day of
condensate. Benzene production will be only 150,000 metric
tons a year, compared with plans by the private investors for
output of more than 300,000 tons. But production of
paraxylene, used to make synthetic fiber, will be 335,000
tons, compared with the previous plan of 197,000 tons.
   If Pertamina runs short of condensate, which it exports,
it can use naphtha, a crude-oil derivative, as feedstock.
Pertamina controls naphtha supplies. "They assume that if
push comes to shove, Pertamina will make feedstock available
for its own project," says Mr. Hasan.
   Claudio Clagluena, Thyssen's representative in Jakarta,
says the change to ownership by Pertamina "makes a lot of
sense." Some Jakarta oil industry executives are concerned
that the switch indicates that Pertamina opposes a private
role in upstream petrochemical production, but Mr. Clagluena
says he feels Pertamina is right to hold on to these
activities.
   While it won't enter upstream production as hoped, Humpuss
still comes away with an expanded role in petrochemicals.
Four days after saying its consortium had received
Pertamina's order for construction of the aromatics plant,
Mitsui also announced Indonesian government approval of a
$200 million PTA venture near the site of the planned
aromatics plant at Arun. Humpuss will hold a 10% stake, and
Pertamina will hold 20%. Mitsui Petrochemical Industries Ltd.
will hold 50%, and Mitsui &amp; Co. 20%.
   Competition to sell PTA, unlike that for aromatics, could
be intense. At least four private joint ventures of
Indonesian and foreign concerns are considering PTA
production to provide fiber for the country's booming textile
and garment exports.
   With domestic demand for petrochemical end-products rising
rapidly, several Indonesian groups, including those headed by
Mr. Suharto's sons, have formulated ambitious plans for
involvement in the industry. The two elder sons previously
benefited from a now-abolished monopoly that imported
petrochemical products for making plastics. After the
monopoly was ended in late 1988, industry analysts expected
the sons to move to establish a strong position in domestic
petrochemical production.
   Despite world economic uncertainty caused by the Persian
Gulf crisis, the Indonesian petrochemical industry appears
poised for rapid expansion. Robert Kennedy, chairman of Union
Carbide Corp., told a Jakarta audience earlier this month
that Indonesia should be in the "logical forefront" of world
petrochemical industries for the next 50 years. He noted that
Indonesia has the advantage of oil and coal supplies to make
feedstock and a growing domestic market, and said the country
could become the hub of a regional petrochemicals market.

   U.S. Agencies Get Dividends From Wall Street
   As Hordes of Yuppies Look for Government Jobs

   WASHINGTON -- Is working for the federal government
becoming fashionable again? Or does it just beat not working
at all?
   As brokerage houses and Wall Street-related law firms
suffer through a recession that has seen 50,000 firings,
federal financial agencies are finding droves of
high-powered, would-be staffers knocking at their doors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You wouldn't believe all the applications we're getting,"
marvels Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, which regulates the savings-and-loan industry.
   At the Securities and Exchange Commission, applications by
attorneys jumped 50% in the most recent fiscal year, to
2,400. At the Justice Department, the number of top
law-school applicants to the agency's "honors" program has
jumped 30% since last year. (About 6% of the nearly 3,000
student applicants will be hired.) Applications are up 44% in
the antitrust division, 47% in the environmental unit and a
whopping 72% in the criminal division.
   Moreover, say federal officials, the qualifications of
those applicants are on the rise too. "You used to see a lot
of people two, three or four years out {of law school}
willing to make a switch," says Gary Sundick, who screens
resumes for the SEC's enforcement unit. "Now you're seeing
people six, seven, eight years out. We're seeing a lot of
very senior associate types who are clearly willing to make a
switch."
   The current business climate is certainly a major factor.
Many applicants, officials say, fall into the category of
"yuppie" Wall Streeters -- traders, lawyers, accountants and
others -- who lived the high life in the 1980s but are now
deciding that the stability of a humble five-figure
government salary beats battling thousands of their brethren
in the shrunken private sector.
   But some also suggest that a change in the political
climate may also be contributing to the upsurge. No one is
confusing the current era with the "ask what you can do for
your country" Kennedy administration, but federal officials
say the Reagan era's hostility toward government regulation
has diminished substantially.
   Under George Bush, "to a certain degree, we are viewed
less as being the problem," says William McLucas, the SEC's
enforcement director. "It probably relates to the fact that
the guy in the White House has held a number of jobs in the
government."
   The influx of new people, he adds, is allowing the agency
to be choosier about whom it hires, boosting the overall
quality of its work force. "Now there is the perception that
there are a lot of good, bright people in the system -- not
just shuffling papers but really working hard to solve
problems," he says.
   Christopher Berlew, a 33-year-old attorney with the SEC,
says the '80s excesses of such figures as convicted insider
trader Ivan Boesky "ticked off" him and many others. "It just
bothered me that all these people who had phenomenal amounts
of money would willingly and consciously break the law to
make more money," he says. So last year he traded in his
$79,000 income as an associate at a large Boston firm and
headed for Washington and its $45,000 offer.
   Mr. Berlew's colleague, Michael Dashjian, also 33, shares
the sentiment. "I felt I wasn't really getting any emotional
satisfaction" at his former Connecticut law firm. "I loved
the firm; they were great people. But it didn't satisfy me. I
felt I was spinning my wheels."
   While much of the government is feeling the effects of
budget austerity, the financial-regulatory crises are
providing an expanding opportunity. At the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., the slowdown in financial services is
allowing the agency to fill hundreds of vacant spots.
   "Candidates sometimes indicate that the demand {in the
private sector} for their services isn't high," says Alfred
Byrne, the banking agency's general counsel, who adds he
often receives as many as 150 resumes a day. But he thinks
the interest stems more from professionals' desire to resolve
the messy problems of the banking industry. "Frankly, we
think we're where the action is." The FDIC, he adds, will be
boosting its legal staff by 50% next year, to 1,500 lawyers.
   Gerri Rigby, a 38-year-old Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. veteran, is
running a program for the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency
charged with taking over failed thrifts and selling them off.
In 15 years at the big brokerage house, Ms. Rigby handled a
host of senior trading positions, dealing in specialized,
esoteric products for corporate clients. In her last job, as
an executive director of Merrill Lynch International, she set
up and ran a major trading desk in Tokyo.
   But she says she burned out from the frequent 20-hour days
and wondered what she would do next. When Merrill offered her
a New York assignment, she turned it down, doubting that she
would be challenged enough and worrying about the fragile
state of jobs on Wall Street. "As firms consolidated, I
didn't want to have to go back to fight for a position of
seniority," she recalls. She toyed with the idea of opening
her own investment firm, but fretted about the hours and the
economy in the period after the crash of 1987.
   So after a year off -- spent in part tanning on the Jersey
Shore -- Ms. Rigby got a call from an RTC official -- former
Merrill colleague Elisabeth Spector -- who was looking for
experienced Wall Streeters to run the sale of assets. Ms.
Rigby, enticed by the challenge, now heads a group selling
debt and other assets of thrifts taken over by the federal
government. Her aides on the project are also Wall Street
veterans, savvy in the ways of trading desks, bid-and-asked
spreads and the like.
   In addition to the flood of new applicants, federal
officials say departure rates are declining. The SEC, for
instance, currently projects that the turnover rate in fiscal
1991 will decline to 13.5% from 14.2% last fiscal year and
14.7% the year before. The trend greatly increases output,
because new workers generally don't provide much value to
agencies for the first year or so.
   Despite the flood of new applicants and the lengthening
tenure of existing jobholders, most lawyers and others still
seem to view the government as only a temporary career
stopover -- a place to face a challenge, gain experience or
make a contribution, and then move on. "Once the assets go
away, we will all go back to the private sector in one form
or another," says the RTC's Ms. Rigby. "There should be a
heck of a market out there for people who do a good job at
the RTC."

   Spanish Fashion Designers Finding
   Bankers Are Less Kind Than Critics

   MADRID -- When Mexican-born designer Rene Zamudio arrived
here four years ago, the first thing he did was ask
directions to the garment district.
   "They sent me to a zipper store down the street," says
32-year-old Mr. Zamudio, who came to Madrid after
free-lancing on New York's Seventh Avenue. "That's the way
things were."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although Madrid is a far cry from Milan and Paris, Spanish
fashion has gained growing international recognition in
recent years. Designers such as Mr. Zamudio have become
regulars at fashion shows in Europe and Japan, and their
collections have won world-wide praise. This sudden flurry of
interest has raised government hopes that Spain is on its way
to becoming an important force in European design.
   As the experiences of many Spanish designers illustrate,
however, critical acclaim doesn't always attract the
financial and industrial backing that designers need to
survive in a competitive market. Nor does it necessarily
translate into growing sales, particularly at home where
fashion has traditionally meant French, Italian or German
design.
   "Spain has a strong cultural force that has been a source
of inspiration for many foreign designers," says Maria Jesus
Escribano, director of the government's Center for the
Promotion of Design and Fashion. "But Spain is still in the
process of creating its own fashion culture."
   Glossy advertising campaigns, scholarships abroad and two
annual fashion shows, one in Madrid and the other in
Barcelona, are the mainstay of an eight billion pesetas ($84
million) government plan designed to promote Spanish fashion
at home and abroad. Last year the apparel industry, including
footwear, jewelry, leather goods, textiles, clothing and
accessories, employed 430,000 people and posted sales of
three trillion pesetas, equivalent to 7% of Spain's gross
domestic product. The government hopes quality and design
will ensure a place for Spanish apparel in foreign markets,
just the way low prices have in the past.
   The mixed success of the plan's first five years
underscores many of the problems facing Spanish industry as
it gears up for Europe's single market after 1992. The
government's program has stirred international interest in
Spanish fashion, and some designers have flourished. But it
has failed to smooth out many problems that keep the industry
at a disadvantage with other European countries.
   A shortage of financing, poor quality and a lack of
professionalism on the part of retailers, manufacturers and
some designers have brought several struggling clothes
businesses to their knees.
   "The general rule in Spain is that industry isn't prepared
to sell or produce a quality product," says Jesus del Pozo,
44, one of Spain's veteran designers.
   Antonio Alvarado, wardrobe designer for several movies by
Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar, says debts forced him
to close shop temporarily last year until one of a few
industry backers bailed him out. Now that he has secured
financial and industrial support, Mr. Alvarado hopes he can
produce more at lower prices.
   Mr. Alvarado was one of the lucky ones. In October,
designer Manuel Pina decided to give up the fashion business
due to mounting debts. The move came after a financial battle
with his manufacturer, who prevented him from meeting a 1.5
billion peseta order from a Japanese client. "I'm the first
one to fall," he said. "But I don't think I'll be the last."
Now he is designing uniforms for Spain's postal service.
   In the case of Enrique Loewe, the chairman of Spain's
144-year-old leather goods and clothing store Loewe, it's
often easier to fly to Milan to do business than to deal
directly with Spanish industry.
   But Mr. Loewe, who has worked with top European designers
such as Karl Lagerfeld and Giorgio Armani, doesn't limit his
criticism to industrialists. Many Spanish designers, he says,
don't have sufficient training or discipline to survive in a
competitive market. Others, he says, have lost touch with
their clients. "In Spain many {designers} experiment too
much, they bet too heavily on clothes that are difficult to
wear," he says. "There's a lack of interchange" with clients.
   Adds Mr. Zamudio: "We have a really bad reputation in the
U.S. I know what it's like to work in a store; when you don't
get a delivery it's a disaster, and here they don't
understand the damage it does."
   To avoid problems of quality and late delivery, several
Japanese buyers have expressed interest in acquiring the
rights to produce Spanish designer clothes in Japan, where
Spanish fashion is enjoying an unprecedented boom. Many
designers feel their salvation lies in similar arrangements
abroad, particularly in promising markets such as Germany and
some Asian countries, where they feel appreciated by both
consumers and industrialists.
   For their part, textile manufacturers claim they can't
accept the risks of financing the fashion industry. Not only
are designers often considered inexperienced and
unprofessional, but a strong peseta, high interest rates and
onerous social security payments are said to stack the cards
against them in an increasingly competitive world. Analysts
expect hundreds of Spain's 15,000 textile and clothing
manufacturers to fold in coming years because of growing
costs and slumping sales.
   Niki Bosch of the Barcelona textile company Niki Bosch Mir
says: "The environment is this: a strong peseta and high
interest rates. But we have to make a product that enables us
to overcome these problems."
   Thanks to Spain's import barriers and cheap labor, many
manufacturers expanded rapidly in the past, but have failed
to adapt to new market conditions and changing consumer
tastes.
   Since joining the European Community in 1986, Spain's
economy began to prosper. In that period, its tastes have
evolved rapidly, a fact many manufacturers don't seem to
realize. Spaniards, for example, are once again demanding
natural fabrics, which fell out of use during Spain's
economic boom in the 1960s. At that time, synthetics formed
part of Spain's entry into the modern world of mass
production.
   The weak link between design and industry also has
resulted in a dearth of funding for struggling designers.
Though the government provides scholarships abroad and other
financial help, the fashion industry is still short of funds.
   But designers say they don't expect the government to
clear the way for them. Instead, they say, the key to the
future lies with cementing solid relations with retailers and
industry, and seeking new markets abroad. Although the future
looks difficult, the worst appears to be in the past.
   "We had to work in circumstances that almost nobody else
could have survived," says Roberto Verinno, a designer from
Galicia who is well-known internationally. "Our {experience}
is almost a miracle."

   'Cause the amount of food that we'll consume
   It will cause our bellies to balloon.
   -- "Ain't No Time for Diets"
                                                                                                       

   O.K., so "White Christmas" it isn't. But rhythm and blues
singer Janey Clewer is still hoping her new song about the
travails of dieting during the holidays will help push her
new Christmas album to the top of the charts. "I think
there's a place for both old and new Christmas music," says
Ms. Clewer.
   Fat chance.
   Each December, with visions of dollar signs dancing in
their heads, songwriters and singers come out with new
Christmas tunes to add to the hundreds that already have been
recorded. The 1980s brought such would-be classics as "Wreck
the Malls," "Somebody Stole My Santa Claus Suit," "Funky,
Funky Christmas," "The 12 Pains of Christmas" and "Santa Got
a DWI."
   Most flop, miserably. "Basically, Christmas is etched in
stone as far as the market goes. It's hard to break that,"
says Troy White, national director of progressive music for
Epic Records, a unit of CBS Records Inc. "Artists hope
they'll have the next `White Christmas,' but it doesn't
happen."
   But they keep trying anyway because writing a hit
Christmas tune is the next best thing to cornering the market
on mistletoe and Christmas trees: Each year, different
singers record the hits -- and the royalties flow in. Since
1945, when Mel Torme and Robert Wells wrote "A Christmas
Song" (better known by its first line: "Chestnuts roasting on
an open fire"), more than 550 versions of it have been
recorded, by everyone from Ramsey Lewis to Barbra Streisand
to Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians. Messrs. Torme and
Wells still each receive more than $100,000 a year in
royalties. "It's a bloody king's ransom," says Mr. Torme.
   "Silver Bells," written in 1950 for a Bob Hope movie
called "The Lemon Drop Kid" and since recorded by everyone
from Elvis Presley to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, still
brings in more than $50,000 a year in royalties for each of
its two writers, Ray Evans and Jay Livingston. "We wrote it
very reluctantly because psychologically we believed all the
good Christmas songs had already been written," says Mr.
Evans. "Luckily, it was first sung by Bing Crosby, so it sold
around 125 million records." Bing Crosby also, of course,
sang "White Christmas," the best-selling Christmas single
ever.
   If it's any encouragement to modern-day Christmas song
writers, even unlikely melodies have become classics. It took
Donald Gardner just 30 minutes to write "All I Want for
Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth" in 1944 for a second-grade
class he taught in Smithtown, N.Y. Three years later, he
played the tune at a music teachers' conference for a friend,
a representative of a music-publishing company, who liked it.
It was recorded by Spike Jones, released in 1948 and sold 1.8
million records in seven weeks. Mr. Gardner knows of 25
different versions -- including one by Dread Zepplin, a
reggae-rock band -- but he's sure there are more. "I scout
around every year just to see what's there. On Dec. 26, I
turn into a pumpkin."
   But coming up with a new hit is nearly as hard as spotting
Santa coming down the chimney. The last Christmas singles to
make Billboard Magazine's weekly top 10 list for pop music,
both in December 1958, were "The Chipmunk Song" by David
Seville and the Chipmunks (best known words: "Alvin] ALVIN]")
and "Jingle Bell Rock" by Joe Beal and Jim Boothe. "Chipmunk"
ranked No. 1 and was on the charts for 13 weeks. "Jingle Bell
Rock," sung by Bobby Helms, ranked No. 6 and was on the
charts for 21 weeks.
   A Christmas song hasn't even made it into Billboard's top
100 singles since 1984 ("Do They Know It's Christmas?" which
was part of a charity album to aid the Ethiopian famine, and
"The Greatest Gift of All" by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton.)
One problem is that the topic is awfully well worn. Ms.
Clewer says writing Christmas music is "lyrically confining
because you have to conform to Christmas and find some new
twist." And most folks prefer golden oldies anyway. "Nat King
Cole, Barbra Streisand, Frank Sinatra -- all those lines sell
steadily every year," says Robert Stapleton, district manager
at Tower Records in Boston.
   Moreover, new Christmas songs get little radio air time
because stations have curtailed playing carols. Unlike the
Christmas shopping season, which has expanded, now starting
before Thanksgiving, the Christmas carol season has been
shrinking. Once as long as six weeks, it now is only two or
three weeks.
   KJLH in Los Angeles, for example, began playing 10
Christmas songs a day about 18 days before Christmas. It has
14 carols on its frequent-play list, only four of which were
released in 1990. The top requested carol? "The Christmas
Song," recorded by Nat King Cole in 1946.
   For lesser-known artists, this is bad news. "Lack of
exposure of new songs prevents them from being accepted,"
says Harold Bronson, managing director of Rhino Records Inc.,
a Los Angeles record company. So, to compete with the songs
of Christmases past, many musicians have abandoned schmaltz
for smirks. Consider 1987's "Wreck the Malls:"
                                                                                                       

   Wreck the malls this Xmas season
   Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
   Blow your cash for no good reason
   Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
                                                                                                       

   Such songs irritate purists like Mr. Torme, 65. Of 1986's
"Santa Got a DWI," Mr. Torme says, "How would real Christians
feel if Santa came home drunk?" Adds Clarence James, an
analyst for a Stamford, Conn., finance company who buys a few
Christmas albums every year, "Christmas is not a funny time
of year. It has very serious meaning. Singing `Grandma Got
Run Over by a Reindeer' {a 1979 tune} isn't my idea of
Christmas. . . . Just by the very title, I wouldn't buy it.
If I heard it on the radio, I'd change the station."
   Judging by some recent hits, realism may be in. Barry
Manilow's hot-selling new album, "Because It's Christmas,"
which has sold 600,000 copies in just one month (Billboard's
No. 40 album this week), includes a song he co-wrote with the
late Johnny Mercer titled "I Guess There Ain't No Santa
Claus." Some of the lyrics:
                                                                                                       

   I got evenings to share that nobody will spare.
   I guess there ain't no Santa Claus.
   I don't flirt. I don't dance. 'Cause I don't get a chance.
   I guess there ain't no Santa Claus.
                                                                                                       

   Why so gloomy? "I didn't want to write about `Winter
Wonderland' or `Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.' I think we
have enough of that," says Mr. Manilow. "I wanted to write
more of a jazz album . . . aimed at adult, romantic
feelings."
   Eric Mercury's 1989 song "Christmas Presence" on the
"Christmas Cheers from Motown" album tells about a little
girl longing for her absent father to return home for
Christmas. Mr. Mercury is sure that the song is so close to
reality for many of today's children of divorced parents that
it just might become a classic. "White Christmas, chestnuts
roasting, I love that stuff. But it doesn't exist anymore,"

   AT&amp;T Settles Back Into Waiting Game
   In Its Hostile $6.12 Billion Bid for NCR

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- After a two-week burst of headlines and
excitement, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has settled
back to play a waiting game in its $6.12 billion bid for NCR
Corp.
   AT&amp;T, which launched a proxy fight Monday to back up its
$90-a-share hostile tender offer, is now looking to Jan. 15,
three weeks from now, as the next milestone in its campaign
to acquire the Dayton, Ohio, computer maker.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That's when AT&amp;T expects to announce the percentage of NCR
stock whose holders want to sell despite NCR's determination
to remain independent. Around the same time, AT&amp;T expects to
announce the percentage of shares voting for a special
meeting to oust the NCR board.
   If, as AT&amp;T expects, between 60% and 80% of NCR
shareholders want to sell, and if more than 50% want a
meeting to vote out the board, that could put pressure on NCR
to agree to conduct friendly merger negotiations, instead of
holding out for $125 a share, or $8.5 billion.
   People close to AT&amp;T say executives of the
telecommunications giant have been surprised by the vehemence
of NCR Chairman Charles E. Exley Jr. in rejecting AT&amp;T's
$90-a-share offer. AT&amp;T evidently also has been surprised
that NCR won't hold merger talks.
   "I sense a growing frustration on the part of {AT&amp;T
management} to get this thing done," says Jack Grubman, a
telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber Inc. Mr. Grubman
says AT&amp;T managers may have believed they could acquire NCR
"just by showing up" and may be growing "impatient."
   Mr. Grubman believes that AT&amp;T should raise its bid in
order to reduce the chances that a prolonged takeover battle
will damage NCR's computer business. But other analysts, such
as Maria Lewis of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., applauded
AT&amp;T's "discipline" in holding at $90 instead of bidding
against itself.
   Some people familiar with the situation say AT&amp;T continues
to regard Mr. Exley's rhetoric against the bid as posturing
before an eventual negotiation. They say AT&amp;T remains
committed to the acquisition, realizing it may take time to
complete.
   For its part, NCR seems to be digging in for a long fight,
playing for time in the hope that AT&amp;T may grow discouraged
or impatient between now and April 17, when NCR plans to hold
its annual meeting.
   As hopes have faded for a quick merger accord, NCR's stock
has faded steadily from a post-bid high of $92.875 to
yesterday's close of $87.75, unchanged, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   For now, both sides are keeping the gloves on, refraining
from some of the rougher tactics of proxy fights, such as
personal attacks on individuals or scathing critiques of
corporate track records. AT&amp;T hasn't sued NCR directors
personally. And a series of NCR ads this week has opted for a
restrained, gently mocking tone instead of thundering
denunciations.
   NCR appears to be pinning its legal hopes on a new variant
of the "just-say-no" strategy, saying it wants to remain
independent but is willing to conduct merger talks at a much
higher price level. Lawyers familiar with NCR point to
several cases, such as Universal Foods Corp., in which courts
haven't required boards of targets to drop their "poison
pill" anti-takeover defenses in the face of hostile bids.
   The broadest precedent is a bid by Paramount
Communications Inc. for Time Inc., which planned to merge
with Warner Communications Inc. Delaware courts refused to
force Time to drop its poison-pill defense to let
shareholders accept the Paramount bid, saying Time's board
had broad discretion to execute corporate strategy.
   AT&amp;T may be assuming this contest will resemble two
combined bid-and-proxy battles that ended this spring just
before each target's annual meeting. Great Northern Nekoosa
Corp. agreed to be acquired after a three-month seige by
Georgia-Pacific Corp., and Norton Co. sought a rescuing
acquirer under pressure from a bid-and-proxy battle by BTR
PLC. In each case, the target company agreed to be sold
rather than face overwhelming defeat in a shareholder vote.
   Steven Milunovich, an analyst at First Boston Corp.,
believes NCR executives "truly want to be left alone. The
people who at first thought this was just a negotiating
tactic didn't understand Exley." Still, Mr. Milunovich
considers a negotiated merger highly probable. He explains,
"It doesn't appear that many shareholders are willing to take
NCR's side."

   GE Wins Contract Over Pratt &amp; Whitney
   To Design Engine for Japan Fighter Jet

   TOKYO -- General Electric Co. won an important competition
over rival Pratt &amp; Whitney Co. to design the engine for
Japan's controversial FSX fighter plane.
   The decision, expected to be announced by the Japan
Defense Agency today, ends a three-year battle between the
world's two leading aircraft-engine makers for a share of the
high-profile project. As the U.S. government scales back on
arms allocations, the stakes are growing for U.S. companies
for such military spending overseas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The immediate concrete benefits to GE are small. The
company has a commitment only to sell as many as seven
prototype engines, with a likely total value of about $25
million. But the design work almost certainly gives GE a hand
in subsequent engine production for the full project,
currently planned at 100 to 130 planes, and valued at a
minimum of $100 million for the engine maker.
   Both companies also have wagered that the bragging rights
from a highly publicized victory in Japan could help tip
similar decisions in other countries, such as Egypt, Israel,
Turkey and Greece. "Japan's wisdom in these matters is held
in high regard, and the decision could influence similar
decisions in other major international markets," Robert F.
Daniell, chief executive of Pratt &amp; Whitney's parent,
Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp., said last
month at a Tokyo news conference.
   GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., confirmed it had won the
contract but declined to comment further, pending Japan's
formal announcement.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney said it was "very disappointed" to hear of
the Japanese government's decision. William C. Missimer,
president of the company's government engine business, said,
"We firmly believe the choice is not a reflection on the
technical merits and operational superiority of the PW-229
engine." Despite this setback, Pratt &amp; Whitney said the
international sales potential of its F100-PW-229 fighter
plane is expected to remain strong.
   The FSX, Japan's next-generation fighter, has been
controversial since its inception. The plane is being
co-developed by the U.S. and Japan, and American critics have
alleged that U.S. aircraft companies participating will be
helping Japan catch up in one of the few industrial sectors
where it still lags far behind the U.S.
   Regarding the engine contract as well, critics have
suggested that the U.S. will inevitably end up teaching
potential Japanese competitors how to take on GE and Pratt &amp;
Whitney. Once production starts in the mid to late 1990s, GE
will license engine technology to one of Japan's three major
aircraft companies, yet to be selected, and build the engine
with that Japanese company. The details of exactly how much
GE will make and how much it will license haven't yet been
worked out.
   Defenders of the agreement have countered that GE will
have an even more advanced engine in production in the U.S.
by the time it starts sharing technology for the FSX engine.
   The main U.S. contractor for the project is St.
Louis-based General Dynamics Corp., whose F-16 is the basic
model for the FSX. General Dynamics has been co-designing the
plane with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. since April, but
the two companies have had to wait for an engine selection to
complete part of their work.
   After surviving the political flap in the U.S. Congress
over technology-sharing, the FSX is now caught in a crunch in
the Japanese Diet over cost overruns. The Japan Defense
Agency recently said the total project cost is likely to run
more than 40% higher than initially thought, and is currently
asking the Japanese Diet for more money. Some industry
analysts think the project may be scaled back.
   Still, the win is important for GE in its continuing
competition with Pratt &amp; Whitney. The two companies together
account for two-thirds of all military-engine sales in the
world, and while they were about equal in the early 1980s, GE
says it has pulled to a commanding lead, with 42% of the
world market share against 25% for Pratt &amp; Whitney.
   For many years, Pratt &amp; Whitney has been supplying engines
for the made-in-Japan version of McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s
F-15 fighter.

   SYDNEY -- Nervous investors sent News Corp. shares
plunging 20% as rumors swirled that the flagship of media
mogul Rupert Murdoch is heading for trouble.
   The shares closed at 4.35 Australian dollars, or US$3.36,
apiece on the Australian Stock Exchange, down A$1.09 from
Wednesday's close, prompting a query from the exchange.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Murdoch, who controls about 45% of the company and is
chief executive, told officials that News Corp. "knows of no
reason for the recent variation" in the price, and he tried
to scotch fears about the progress of the proposed
rescheduling of most of the company's A$10.53 billion
(US$8.13 billion) bank debt.
   In a statement, Mr. Murdoch said that News Corp. is "very
pleased" with its bank negotiations and that "a large
majority of banks" in the group "have already indicated
agreement to the terms." News Corp. originally was aiming to
pin the bank rescheduling down by mid-December, but the
company has since indicated that the debt negotiations are
likely to drag into January.
   The rumors -- some of them probably fanned by short
sellers, investors who bet that News Corp.'s stock price will
drop -- included talk that the company would be hit with a
tax bill of A$1 billion by the Australian government.

   NBC Cuts Schedule
   For Daytime, Gives
   Time to Affiliates

   NEW YORK -- The NBC network, running a distant third in
daytime programming, will give one hour back to affiliates to
let them fill the time themselves, beginning in September
1991.
   The move means many of NBC's 209 affiliates will have to
scramble to buy syndicated programs to fill the suddenly
vacant hour. Affiliates generally applauded the move. "It's a
practical solution to a practical problem," given NBC's lack
of success in daytime programming, said Bill Bolster,
president of Multimedia Broadcasting Co., which owns three
NBC affiliates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The decision by NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, reduces
the network's daytime schedule to four-and-a-half hours, the
lowest of any broadcast network. CBS Inc.'s network, rated
No. 1 in the period, programs five-and-a-half hours; and ABC,
a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., programs five hours in
daytime, which runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
   NBC said it is likely to cancel its 10 a.m. block of game
shows -- "Let's Make a Deal" and "Classic Concentration" --
which is cleared by only two-thirds of its affiliates.
   "It's a (part of the day) that's had serious erosion in
ratings," said John Damiano, NBC's senior vice president of
affiliate relations. For the first 13 weeks of the 1990-91 TV
season, NBC's daytime schedule was viewed by 3.1% of the U.S.
homes with television sets. CBS had 5.5%; ABC had 4.6%.
   NBC's move, which had been under consideration for months,
comes as all of broadcasting is suffering from a slump in
national advertising. Kenneth H. MacQueen, vice president at
WHO in Des Moines, Iowa, said he was "less than excited" by
NBC's reduction in daytime. "I wouldn't consider it a
positive move," he said. "You don't see the other networks
throwing back (advertising time) that's hard to sell, do
you?"
   It is the second shake-up in daytime programming at NBC,
which recently canceled the half-hour soap opera
"Generations." NBC News is preparing a half-hour midday
information show, "A Closer Look," anchored by Faith Daniels,
to premiere Jan. 8. NBC is also planning a reality-based
show, "Trial Watch," which will feature videotaped footage of
actual trials; it will probably replace another daytime
program, "The Marsha Warfield Show."
   NBC also has ordered pilots of two female-oriented talk
shows, "Women's Diaries" with Linda Ellerbee and "AM
Assignment," as well as two NBC News productions, "Today's
Women" and "Today's People."

   OTTAWA -- Key Canadian interest rates fell yesterday to
their lowest levels in almost two years amid warnings of a
deepening Canadian economic recession.
   Major commercial banks cut their prime lending rates
one-half percentage point to 12.75%, the lowest level since
February 1989. The prime rate is a benchmark for various
lending rates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian Manufacturers' Association, an industry
group, said Canada's manufacturing sector "will likely remain
in a recession until at least the third quarter of 1991."
   Royal Bank of Canada economist Michael Gregory, warned
that the current economic recession "is going to get worse."
Canada's gross domestic product declined 0.3% in the second
and third quarters.
   Aron Gampel, senior economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said
a cut in U.S. short-term rates this week gave the Bank of
Canada room to lower Canadian rates without weakening the
value of the Canadian dollar. The Canadian currency has been
buoyed by wide spreads between comparable Canadian and U.S.
short-term interest rates.
   Despite yesterday's decline, Canadian short-term interest
rates remain more than 4.5 percentage points above U.S.
rates. "That's still a very tough monetary policy," Mr.
Gampel said.
   The Canadian central bank has maintained a restrictive
economic policy because of inflation concerns.
   Some provincial politicians who met with Canadian Finance
Minister Michael Wilson yesterday warned that failure to cut
interest rates further will prolong the current recession. "I
think interest rates have to come down even further," said
Alberta Treasurer Dick Johnston.
   Mr. Wilson said there are still some lingering inflation
pressures in the Canadian economy, particularly high wage
gains. Interest rates are moving lower, Mr. Wilson said. "How
quickly we can achieve that depends on the inflationary
pressures."
   The Canadian Chamber of Commerce urged the government to
freeze spending over the next two years. The group said a
spending freeze was the "only viable solution" for achieving
"lasting reductions" in interest rates.
   Yesterday's prime rate cut followed a drop in the Bank of
Canada's influential bank rate, which fell to 11.78%
yesterday from 12.01%. The bank rate is the levy charged by
the central bank on loans to financial institutions.
   Royal Bank's Mr. Gregory said Canada's short-term interest
rates will likely continue declining until February and then
level off to offset the inflationary impact of Canada's new
7% value-added tax. The new tax, which received final
approval this week, is expected to boost the consumer price
index by a one-time increase of 1.25%. The tax will take
effect Jan. 1.

during the 1980s, the first decade-long decline since the
1930s, the government reported.
   The Census Bureau said 63.9% of all households owned their
homes in 1989, down from 65.6% in 1980. Nearly all the rest
rented. Homeownership, however, is still much more common
than it was in 1950, when 55% of households owned their
homes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The decline in homeownership during the 1980s was
particularly noticeable among younger Americans, who saw
housing prices in some regions soar beyond reach.
   Some 39.1% of households headed by a person under 35 years
old owned homes in 1989, down from 41.2% in 1982, the first
year for which such data are available. Among households
headed by someone over 50, the figure remained constant at
77.2%.
   Although homeownership rates in the Northeast and West
continue to be consistently lower than the national average,
the Northeast was the only region where a higher fraction of
households owned houses at the end of the decade than at the
beginning.
   Patterns of homeownership vary widely; renting is more
common in urban areas. In the District of Columbia, for
instance, only 38.7% of the households own their own homes.
In New York state, the fraction is 52.3% and in California,
it's 53.6%. But in West Virginia, 74.8% of the households own
their homes; in Maine, 73.6% do.

   UJB FINANCIAL Corp.'s directors sharply reduced the
Princeton, N.J., bank holding company's quarterly dividend
because of concerns about the weak real estate market and the
economy. UJB also said it expects to break even or report a
modest loss for all of 1990. For 1990's first nine months,
UJB reported profit plunged 88% to $11.3 million, or 22 cents
a share. The quarterly payout was cut to 15 cents a common
share from the 29 cents that had been paid for the previous
five quarters. The dividend is payable Feb. 1 to stock of
record Jan. 8. UJB Financial, with assets exceeding $13
billion, has more than 270 offices in New Jersey and eastern
Pennsylvania. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, UJB's shares fell 37.5 cents to $7.625.

   STOCKHOLM -- The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, decided
to allow foreign banks with branches in Sweden to participate
in the Riksbank clearing and to make overnight borrowings in
the Riksbank according to the same rules that apply to
domestic banks.
   The decision means foreign bank branches can operate in
Sweden under the same conditions as Swedish banks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Participation in the Riksbank clearing and permission to
borrow from the Riksbank had been allowed only to Swedish
banking companies.
   The decision further opens the Swedish banking system to
foreign banks. In August, foreign bank branches gained
permission to operate in Sweden. Before that, only
subsidiaries of foreign banks were permitted.

ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)
FORECASTS AND ANALYSIS OF U.S. ECONOMIC INDICATORS (EMJ)
STEEL MANUFACTURERS (STL)
ALUMINUM (ALU)
</IN>
<LP>
   The Big R is beginning to hit Main Street manufacturing.
   Until recently, Midwest manufacturers were largely dodging
the recession bullet that has been trained on East and West
coast financial, real estate and other industries. Lately
though, makers of everything from steel and machine tools to
lift trucks and paper have begun feeling the pinch, and the
wave of layoffs that began on Wall Street has reached the
heartland. U.S. manufacturing employment fell by 200,000 in
November alone, or one-third of the total job loss since
January 1989, when the sector's employment peaked for this
economic cycle.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, industrial production in November plunged 1.7%,
the biggest monthly drop in the index since January 1982.
Economists say the report, coupled with recent increases in
unemployment, clearly played a role in persuading the Federal
Reserve Board this week to further cut interest rates.
   "November was a very, very big hit," says Jill Thompson,
an economist who follows the industrial sector at
DRI/McGraw-Hill. "I don't think anyone anticipated that it
would hit so hard so fast."
   Much of the retraction reflects the chilling effect from
cutbacks in the auto industry, which in November experienced
a whopping 27% decline in production from two months earlier.
Thousands of Midwest manufacturers tied to car makers have
caught Detroit's cold. Earlier this month, three steelmakers
with major auto contracts -- the LTV Steel unit of LTV Corp.,
Armco Inc. and Rouge Steel Co. -- announced that they would
each indefinitely idle furnaces that had accounted for
between 22% and 30% of their capacity. Armco's moves at two
furnaces affected more than 600 employees.
   Other industrial companies are likewise suffering as
skittish consumers sour on major purchases such as
appliances, and businesses postpone nonessential investments.
General Electric Co. plans to eliminate 500 of 9,300 factory
jobs at year end at its appliance division in Louisville, Ky.
That will only worsen already gloomy statistics: The nation's
output of appliances fell 8.9% in October while employment in
the industry dropped 5.4% from year-earlier levels.
   Still, most economists don't expect states like Ohio,
where housing starts have fallen only 1% this year, to see
the same fallout as New Jersey, where they've plunged 40%.
Moreover, they believe a recession will be short-lived, with
manufacturers hitting rock bottom between now and the second
quarter of 1991. And they don't expect a rerun of the early
1980s recession, when multimillion-dollar quarterly losses
were routine. Instead, most manufacturers are expected to
remain profitable on an operating basis throughout a
recession.
   "Manufacturers are very lean," says Priscilla Trumbull,
senior industrial economist with WEFA Group, an economic
forecasting company. "They've continued to cut employment
during fairly good times and managed to maintain output."
Indeed, manufacturers are producing 40% more goods than they
did a decade ago, with 1.9% fewer employee hours.
   John Jacobson, who watches steel for AUS Consultants, says
plant shutdowns aren't necessarily bad news. In the early
1980s recession, he says, manufacturers maintained high
operating rates regardless of demand in a futile effort to
keep plants open and workers employed. "Now they're gearing
back to produce at levels consistent with demand," he says.
   Nacco Industries Inc., for instance, is closing a lift
truck assembly plant at Brunswick, Ga., and consolidating
assembly of the vehicles at Greenville, N.C. President Alfred
M. Rankin Jr. says Nacco's is the world's lowest-cost lift
truck product, but the company wants to ensure that it keeps
that position.
   Such moves are also necessary to maintain lower
inventories, another critical factor in keeping
recession-bound manufacturers afloat. Although consumer
purchases of cars have clearly declined, observers say the
auto makers are throttling back production to pre-empt an
inventory buildup. Says Inland Steel Industries Inc. Chairman
Frank W. Luerssen: "Lower inventories means we should quickly
benefit from any rebound in consumer spending."
   In the meantime, manufacturers can expect bad news. WEFA
believes that spending for durable equipment will fall about
5.5% between the second quarter of 1990 and the second
quarter of 1991. Ms. Trumball noted that, in the last three
months, makers of custom-made machinery that serve specific
industries saw output and employment drop 2.9% and 1.5%,
respectively; the same levels for makers of construction
machines fell 2.1% and 1.5%, respectively.
   Steelmakers, who enjoyed relatively healthy orders and
shipments through October, saw November orders plummet about
17% from October, making deliveries look especially low for
January and February. The big factor: Auto makers have
canceled major orders, leaving piles of now-unwanted steel
sitting on producers' floors.
   Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber, says
steelmakers had already set aside certain days to produce
steel for car makers, and now have holes in their production
schedule. In addition, they're scrambling to get rid of
unwanted auto-related steel products just as demand is
evaporating from the appliance and other consumer
durable-goods industries and the construction sector.
   That, in part, has caused the prices of such products as
hot-rolled band to drop 10% in recent weeks. And although
steelmakers have so far remained firm on a 4% price rise
slated for Jan. 1, chances are that the increase will be
rescinded. Ford Motor Co. has already asked suppliers, such
as steel companies, to cut their prices 1% on Jan. 1, in
spite of yearlong contracts. Mr. Marcus expects steel prices
to continue to fall through the middle of 1991, before
beginning to rise again.
   Still, Charles Bradford, who watches the steel industry
for UBS Securities, expects most steelmakers to remain
largely profitable throughout a recession, barring write-offs
and strikes. "We believe that the steel industry may perform
much better during this recession than during the last one,"
he says. A key reason, he says, is the weak dollar, which has
kept imports down and makes U.S. steelmakers more
competitive.
   The weak dollar has helped all manufacturers. Reynolds
Metals Co. says its shipments were up 11% in November from a
year earlier, thanks mainly to a 29% increase in exports and
strong demand from the U.S. aerospace industry.
   Aluminum is one manufacturing sector that doesn't seem to
have seen a recession yet. Aluminum Co. of America says that
while corporate earnings will continue to reflect low primary
aluminum prices, demand for fabricated products remains
relatively strong. "We're not in the layoff mode and we don't
have plans to curtail production anywhere," asserts President
Fred Fetterolf. "Maybe we're on the rim of the precipice but
we don't see {a big falloff} yet."
   John Tumazos, with Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities,
says a credit squeeze for smaller and midsize companies is
just beginning and may translate in the future into fewer
capital goods projects and investments. "Capital goods
markets typically don't reflect the bad news to its full
extent in the first six months of a recession," he says.

   Tokyo Stocks Fall on Profit-Taking as Investors

   Tokyo stock prices fell back Thursday, finishing just
above their intraday lows under pressure of profit-taking.
   The impact of Tuesday's discount-rate reduction by the
U.S. Federal Reserve Board, which spawned active buying
Wednesday, ebbed as investors were unable to see a clear sign
that the Bank of Japan would ease credit, traders said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In London, share prices finished weaker as the resignation
of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze injected a
note of uncertainty into world financial markets.
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 selected issues was down
351.84 points at 24524.94. In trading early Friday, the
Nikkei Index was down 416.49 to 24108.45.
   Volume on the first section Thursday was estimated at 360
million shares, down from 639 million shares Wednesday.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues 856 to 157,
while 125 issues remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was down 26.04 points, or 1.4%, at 1795.37.
   The second section index was down 23.51 points, or 0.8%,
to close at 2823.27.
   Volume in the second section was estimated at five million
shares, down from 5.6 million shares Wednesday.
   As the yen was weaker against the dollar and the Japanese
bond market softened Thursday despite the U.S. discount-rate
cut Tuesday, stock market participants shared a feeling that
they've already heard the extent of the good news.
   The dollar finished Thursday at 134.58 yen, up from 134.05
yen late Wednesday in New York and above 133.27 yen late
Wednesday in Tokyo.
   Traders said both bond and stock markets had discounted an
expected reduction of the U.S. rate.
   "Participants are already looking for the next news on
interest rates, especially a decline in short-term domestic
interest rates," said Atsushi Koishihara, general manager of
stock trading at Taiheiyo Securities.
   Supporting stock prices at the bottom range Thursday were
investment trust funds, "eager to push up and keep the Nikkei
Index above 25000 until the year end," said a trader at
Yamaichi Securities.
   Strong resistance at 25000 on the Nikkei is discouraging
investors from buying stocks at higher prices, however,
traders said, prompting more investors, including dealers, to
begin reducing positions ahead of the long weekend. The
market will be closed Monday for a national holiday.
   Trading by overseas investors slowed down as many of them
have already left for year-end holidays, traders said.
Foreign participation was also discouraged by continued
reports about the involvement of a ruling party politician,
Toshiyuki Inamura, in the ongoing Koshin stock scandal.
   "Foreigners are more sensitive to such a political
scandal" than the Japanese, as reflected on the yen's
weakness on the foreign-exchange market, a trader at Daiwa
Securities said.
   But overall, the impact remained minimal as it was the
previous day.
   Large-capital shares were sold in a broad range, with
steel manufacturers, shipbuilding companies and electric
power companies ending lower. Their prices, however,
rebounded from intraday lows on buying by investment trust
funds and dealers in the afternoon session, traders said.
   Nippon Steel was the most heavily traded stock for the
day, finishing at 444 yen ($3.31), down 1 yen.
   Mitsubishi Heavy Industries lost 15 yen to 700 yen, while
IHI fell 16 yen to 700 yen.
   High-priced, high-technology shares fell from their midday
highs to end mixed.
   Sony was down 130 yen to 6,100 yen and Pioneer lost 70 yen
to 4,050 yen. TDK was up 50 yen to 4,540 yen, while Kyocera
edged up 10 yen to 5,850 yen.
   Investors took profits from construction shares as Kajima
declined 60 yen to 1,620 yen, Shimizu plummeted 20 yen to
1,580 yen and Taisei dropped 30 yen to 1,000 yen.
   London traders said the impact of Mr. Shevardnadze's
decision to leave the Soviet government was felt extensively
across European equity markets.
   "The fears are widespread," said John Reynolds, equity
strategist at brokerage County NatWest WoodMac in London.
"Europe wants a stable Russia without Soviet people piling
over their borders. (The resignation) does add to the general
economic uncertainty which makes markets nervous."
   Wall Street was also having its share of jitters over the
news. Throughout most of the European afternoon, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average was under pressure, although by the
close of the session in London, Wall Street appeared to be
reversing its negative direction.
   At the closing bell, the broad-based Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-Share Index was off 19.9 points at 2158.8.
   In the futures market, the December FT-SE 100-Share Index
contract settled at 2163.0 on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange, compared with its Wednesday
closing of 2193.0.
   At its final calculation, the narrower FT 30-Share Index
was off 19.9 points at 1687.2. Volume reached a moderate
590.2 million shares compared with the 509.3 million issues
traded Wednesday.
   Shares in Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's largest
chemical concern, slid 24 pence (46 cents) to 886 after
several brokerages cut their full-year pretax profit
forecasts to under #1 billion.
   Glaxo shares continued their week-long slide on
competition worries from Astra AB's anti-ulcer drug Losec.
The stock lost 11 to 823.
   Pharmaceutical maker Wellcome lost 22 to 441, after
gaining 20 pence a day ago, on mixed reaction to an analysts
meeting. The company also announced that it sold its Calmic
hygiene service business to Rentokil Group, an environmental
services and property care concern for #26.2 million.
   Unilever also retreated, dropping 10 to 687 after a
downgrading from brokerage UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew.
   Among featured stocks in the broadly lower market,
retailer Marks &amp; Spencer hardened 2.5 to 226 in a flight to
quality amid recessionary times, dealers said. A robust 4.8
million shares changed hands.
   Composite insurer General Accident advanced 3 to 496. The
company is expected to make an announcement Friday, which
market professionals say will be bullish for the company.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Milan and Madrid.
South African gold stocks closed higher.
   Stocks closed lower in Sydney and Hong Kong, and higher in
Singapore, Taipei and Manila, while they closed little
changed in Wellington and mixed in Seoul.

   Weak Economy and Market
   For Real Estate Blamed;
   Loss for Year Is Certain

   BOSTON -- Bank of Boston Corp., blaming the slumping New
England economy, said it will show a "substantial loss" for
the fourth quarter, ensuring a loss for the year.
   Although the bank didn't give an estimate of the loss, a
spokesman said it would be smaller than the bank's
third-quarter loss of $255 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I expect this quarter's loss to be somewhere between $150
and $200 million and for the losses to continue in 1991,"
said Gerard Cassidy, a bank analyst with Tucker Anthony and
R.L. Day in Portland, Maine. "The bank's dividend will almost
surely disappear next year." The problems at Bank of Boston,
the region's largest bank, underscores the continuing slide
of results at banks throughout New England, many of which
have reported losses in the past year.
   With a weakened real estate market worsened by a sluggish
economy, Bank of Boston was struggling under $1.86 billion of
nonperforming assets, mostly soured commercial real estate
loans, as of Sept. 30.
   "The prolonged deterioration in the commerical real estate
markets and the ongoing downturn in the regional economy
continue to adversely affect our operating results," said Ira
Stepanian, chairman and chief executive officer. "However, we
are unwavering in our commitment in this environment to deal
aggressively with credit issues and to maintain what we
believe to be strong loan-loss reserves."
   The projected fourth-quarter loss means that the Bank of
Boston, which had a loss of $207.8 million for the first nine
months, will post a sizable loss for all of 1990. Last year
it had net income of $70.4 million, or 80 cents a share,
after a one-time pretax gain of $147 million from the sale of
its credit-card business.
   In declaring its third-quarter loss, the bank slashed its
dividend from 31 cents to 10 cents a share. Bank officials
said yesterday that the dividend would be maintained at 10
cents for the payment due in January.
   The company's stock closed at $7 a share in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, down 37.5 cents.
   As with many banks in the region, Bank of Boston is
slashing expenses as earnings fall. The bank announced in
September that it planned to reduce its work force by 8%, or
about 1,500 employees, by offering voluntary severance
packages. So far, only about 800 employees have accepted. The
bank said it will now begin a program to lay off at least 700
more employees by the end of next year's first quarter. As
well, the bank announced a deferral of salary increases
affecting at least 5,000 bank officers.

   The Orlando switchboard lit up with season-ticket orders.
Miami redoubled efforts on stadium renovations. Denver was
flooded with resumes for front-office jobs. And Tampa Bay,
Buffalo and Washington went equally nuts this week over the
prospect of getting one of the two worst teams in baseball.
   The six cities were named finalists for the National
League's first expansion in more than 20 years. The two
winners will be picked by next September and begin play in
1993. The contest will be as heated as a pennant race because
it carries World Series-sized stakes: for aspiring cities,
the chance to be called Big League; for would-be owners, the
chance to join the inner circle of the national pastime.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The quest has already been long and arduous -- Tampa Bay's
dating back 13 years -- but the intensity now ratchets up a
notch. Miami's owner laid plans for a name-the-team contest,
a season-ticket drive and other shows of fan support. Buffalo
will invite National League owners to see its rabid sports
fans at a Bills football playoff game. Washington is looking
for a heavy-hitter to both bolster and burnish its ownership
group. Said the group's leader, John Akridge: "I'm out
looking for a zillionaire."
   Indeed, while the expansion game plays out on many levels
-- market comparisons, political maneuverings, civic
implorings -- above all it is about money. Large sums of
money. When baseball last expanded in 1977, the American
League entry fee was $7 million; now it's $95 million. That
year, the average player salary was $76,000; now it's about
$600,000. In the late 1970s, baseball was a cozy little $300
million industry; today, its revenues top $1.2 billion.
   At one level, the $190 million infusion of franchise fees
is a life buoy to keep the incumbent owners' heads above
water. Though baseball turned a $214 million pretax operating
profit in 1989, salaries are spiraling upward fast and teams
in smaller markets are struggling. And every team has been
jolted by a collusion ruling against baseball's owners that
cost each of them $10.8 million. The expansion fees, divvied
among the 12 existing National League teams, replenish
coffers by $15.8 million apiece. The incumbents do have to
provide players to the expansion teams, but only the dregs of
their rosters.
   It's such a great deal, in fact, that the American League
is deeply jealous. After the four-member expansion committee,
composed of three current owners and National League
President Bill White, makes its recommendations, new teams
must be approved by nine of the National League's 12 owners
and a majority of the American League's 14 owners. American
League owners are demanding a cut of the franchise fees. The
National League is adamantly opposed. If the issue is not
peacefully resolved by Commissioner Fay Vincent, the American
League could eventually act as a spoiler, using its veto
power to block the National League from where it would most
like to go.
   That, clearly, is Florida. Quite beyond short-term
self-interest, baseball has long-term strategic reasons for
expansion. By adding big markets, it can build national TV
ratings. By entering virgin baseball territory, it can expand
its fan base. And if it expands into booming areas, there's
lots of potential for attendance growth. Florida is all of
those. It's the fourth most populous state, the third fastest
growing -- and it has no big-league team. California has
five.
   Florida has one entry, Tampa Bay, that is the nation's
13th largest media market. It has another, Miami, that could
be a great export market for baseball to Latin America. It
has a third, Orlando, that's the fastest growing city in
America. The only real question is whether the National
League will put one of its two new teams in Florida -- or
both. The answer may depend on how the American League
dispute plays out; it may depend on whether the National
League wants more geographic diversity; and it may depend on
whether baseball fears political trouble on Capitol Hill if
one state gets all the action.
   If Florida doesn't make a clean sweep, either Denver or
Washington is likely to get the second team. Denver positions
itself as another virgin-territory candidate, opening up
baseball to a whole swath of the country without it. If only
more people lived there. Washington, D.C., positions itself
as the demographics candidate: ninth largest U.S.
metropolitan area, seventh largest media market, biggest city
without a big-league team -- not to mention home to a lot of
members of Congress who like baseball. If only it weren't so
near Baltimore, the Orioles' home 40 miles away.
   For, above all, baseball doesn't want to cannibalize
present teams' markets. That violates good marketing
principles. More important, it violates present owners'
sensibilities. Indianapolis was an early expansion hopeful,
even mounting a drive that sold 11,000 season tickets. But it
is only about 100 miles from Cincinnati. The drive died when
Reds owner Marge Schott, asked about the city's chances,
replied, "Over my dead body."
   That's also what makes Buffalo a long-shot candidate,
though it made the short list. It's so close to Toronto,
Cleveland and Pittsburgh that some were stunned it got this
far. The cannibal factor definitely contributed to sinking
Sacramento (near the two Bay Area teams), Charlotte (Atlanta)
and Nashville (nestled among Atlanta, Cincinnati and St.
Louis).
   Buffalo is also a place that would look better under
baseball's old economics. It could count on huge fan support.
The Buffalo Bisons have set minor-league attendance records
by drawing more than a million fans each of the past three
seasons. But gate receipts mean a lot less than they used to.
A big local TV deal is essential. Any Florida team would
start out with the advantage of a big market. It could figure
on at least an $8 million a year broadcast deal, or more than
double some existing contracts. Buffalo, only the nation's
38th biggest media market, would be disadvantaged.
   The National League not only wants viable markets but,
more than ever, certainty that the new owners can play this
costly game. It's in National League owners' interest to add
strong teams, even if that means an irksome new competitor
for free agents or pennants. Unlike many other industries,
baseball is only as strong as its weakest links. "If they
`competed' one of the Big Three automakers out of business,
the others wouldn't cry," says former Commissioner Bowie
Kuhn. "But if a team goes out of business in baseball, you've
busted up your league."
   Baseball prefers local owners, who won't be tempted to
move to another city -- and make a mess for baseball -- if
the going gets rough. But that's clearly a secondary
consideration, considering the finalist selection of a Tampa
Bay group bankrolled by non-locals, an Orlando group headed
by Michigan resident and Amway billionaire Richard DeVos and
a Denver group headed by a Youngstown beverage distributor.
Baseball is mostly looking for rich owners; it allows just
40% of a team's purchase price to be financed. The central
question, in expansion parlance, has become, "Can he write
the check?"
   The economy forced several once-aspiring owners to pocket
their pens. The baseball economy, moreover, is ever more
scary to expansion owners. Since the end of the season, teams
have lavished more than $230 million on free agents. That
accelerates the salary spiral, even as CBS's $170 million
write-off of baseball losses portends a skimpier national TV
deal in the future. In an open letter to Buffalo fans last
week, owner candidate Bob Rich Jr. warned that the trends may
make baseball unaffordable there. "We do not believe in
baseball at any cost," he said.
   Making money isn't the sole consideration, of course. Some
are in this for civic pride. "It's a labor of love, although
$100 million is a lot of love," says Mr. Akridge. Some are
drawn by the limelight. "There's a lot of ego in it," says
Abel Holtz, a banker in Miami who led an unsuccessful
ownership group there. Some are rabid baseball fans. While at
a Dodger fantasy camp last year, cousins S. Joel Schur and
Stephen Porter got a lead on buying a minor-league St.
Petersburg team. Hooked on running that, they went after the
Tampa Bay franchise. But, says Mr. Porter, "We made a
decision: If this didn't make economic sense, we wouldn't do
it."
   Baseball does make economic sense as a
capital-appreciation play. One expansion team, the Seattle
Mariners, was bought for a fee of $7 million in 1977, sold
for $13.1 million in 1981 and for $77 million in 1990.
Another, the New York Mets, was bought for $3.75 million in
1962, sold for $26 million in 1980 and for $100 million in
1986.
   For cities, the upside is even greater. Denver figures a
team would generate about $93 million a year for the local
economy. The indirect benefits are far greater. "A big-league
team will bring big-league companies," says Thomas Ferguson,
president of the Beacon Council, a private
economic-development group in Miami. "When companies choose
where to expand operations, they consider baseball and
football as amenities that attract people."
   That's why, when Denver's original owner dropped out,
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer personally scrambled around to
assemble a new investor group. It's why Denver and Orlando
have committed to building stadiums, at $100 million-plus a
pop, if they get teams. It's why Washington has committed $25
million to renovate RFK Stadium. It's why St. Petersburg and
the county it's in spent $110 million building a domed
stadium on speculation to compete for a franchise under the
Tampa Bay banner.
   It's also why there's a Senate task force on expansion,
used by senators to pressure baseball into giving their
constituents teams. Its chairman, Democratic Sen. Tim Wirth
of Colorado, has helped keep Denver's hopes alive. Florida's
Republican Sen. Connie Mack has one of baseball's great
names, as grandson of the longtime Philadelphia Athletics
owner, and has helped the Florida cause. The implicit threat:
Congress could repeal baseball's antitrust exemption if
baseball doesn't expand quickly and in the right places.
   That's just one level of the expansion game, which also
involves back-room politicking, back-alley-style jabbing and
slick marketing. Orlando's video presentation to the National
League was produced by the local Disney studio. Miami owner
candidate H. Wayne Huizenga poured about $500,000 into his
presentation, including leather-bound fact books, Tiffany
paperweight gifts and a slick ode-to-South-Florida video. Mr.
Huizenga has some advantages in that medium as chairman of
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp.
   He also has the advantage of having Pittsburgh Pirates
President Carl Barger on Blockbuster's board and Beacon
Council Chairman Jeb Bush in the Miami corner. Mr. Bush is
the brother of Texas Rangers general partner George W. Bush,
who is the son of the other George Bush. This is the contacts
level of the game, played widely and aggressively. The Tampa
Bay group includes developers Sidney and Allen Kohl,
Wisconsin natives who are close to Milwaukee Brewers owner
Bud Selig, who is close to New York Mets co-owner Fred
Wilpon, who sits on the expansion committee.
   Not that it's always an advantage to be a known quantity.
Larry Schmittou, the leader of Nashville's group, helped
scuttle his slim chances during a recent dispute between the
majors and minors. Mr. Schmittou, who runs two minor league
teams, was a vociferous member of the minors' negotiating
committee.
   Since the National League also is an exclusive club,
personal comportment could be decisive in a close contest.
This is sometimes known as "the O'Malley factor," to wit: Can
the applicant be envisioned at the same table as Peter
O'Malley, the powerful, imposing owner of the Los Angeles
Dodgers?
   Even so, the battle could feature some aspects that would
make Mr. O'Malley blush. Orlando may have offered a preview
when its minor-league team held a "St. Petersburg Night" last
August.
   This "salute" to its expansion competitor included free
admission for people over 60, a cane-throwing contest and
Cream of Wheat and Geritol at the concession stands. Explains
the team president and Orlando expansion chief, Pat Williams:
"I was just trying to bring some life to a town that's so
dull the roosters sleep till noon."

sales managers, Donald Glusgol, 62, of Peabody, Mass.,
offered falsified condominium mortgages as collateral for
obtaining $7 million in loans from First Mutual Bank for

   BONN -- A German court ruled Thursday that an
anti-takeover clause Continental AG adopted in 1989 is
invalid.
   Continental, a German tire maker, is the target of a
takeover attempt by the Italian tire maker Pirelli S.p.A.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The district court in Hanover didn't explain its decision.
It ruled on the matter after a Continental stockholder filed
a complaint against the Hanover-based company. Continental
has rejected the financial terms of Pirelli's offer, but it
insists it still is willing to talk to the Italian company
about a merger. Under the 1989 decision reached at the
company's annual meeting, the limit on voting rights can be
changed only with the support of holders of 75% of company
shares. It had required only a simple majority.
   Many German companies have clauses that limit
stockholders' voting stakes to 5% even if their holdings are
larger. The measure makes it difficult for potential buyers
to take over a company, an obstacle that is heightened by the
need to get 75% of the votes to change the rules.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Sports:
   Kings Coach Dick Motta and His Kids
   ----
   By Frederick C. Klein
</HL>

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A9
</SO>
<LP>
   Sacramento, Calif. -- Dick Motta peered through his tinted
glasses and smiled. "I looked out there in the fourth quarter
and saw I had four rookies on the floor," said the coach of
the National Basketball Association's Sacramento Kings. "I
thought I must be crazy."
   But Motta saved his biggest grin for the Arco Arena
scoreboard here Tuesday night, because, at the end, it had
the Kings beating the Minnesota Timberwolves, 108-99. His
team, which had started the season with 13 losses in 14
games, now had won three in a row and five of its last seven.
That had yet to make a dent on the standings -- the Kings
still were last in the league's Pacific Division. It did make
for some nice internal consumption, though.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You work the kids as hard as I do, you like to see some
positive feedback," said the 59-year-old Motta. "Otherwise,
maybe they start thinking the old coach just has 'em running
in circles."
   Time was when a lot of people thought the "old coach," the
NBA's third-winningest ever, regarded using rookies the way a
vegetarian regards a hamburger. His glory teams, the Chicago
Bulls of the mid-1970s and the 1978 champion Washington
Bullets, were grizzled bunches who thrived on the
hand-in-the-face defense and grinding, half-court offense he
has always taught.
   Motta contends that was a bum rap -- it was just that he'd
never had many rookies he thought could play. Besides, that
was then and this is now. After five seasons of unrelenting
woe in the California capital (they've spent just a few days
above the .500 won-lost mark in all that time), the Kings are
embarked on about as thorough-going a youth movement as any
NBA club has tried.
   Trades involving the surrender of such notables as Rodney
McCray, Danny Ainge and Pervous Ellison helped bring the
Kings an unprecedented four first-round draft choices last
summer. As a further result of the swaps, the Kings have only
three players back from last year. One of them is the
weak-kneed Ralph Sampson, who rarely plays.
   This isn't what Motta had in mind when he ended a 1
1/2-year retirement to become Sacramento's fourth coach in
five seasons about one-third into the 1989-90 campaign. He'd
built winners from meager beginnings in Chicago and Dallas,
but says he'd never found a team so woeful as the Kings. They
were 7-21 when he arrived, and won but 16 of 54 under his
hand.
   "Some of the players were OK individually, but
collectively they had no life," he says. "Jerry Reynolds {the
team's director of player personnel} and I decided it would
be better to change the team than to try to change their
attitude."
   He adds: "I took this job because I wanted it, not because
I needed it, and with the understanding I could shape it to
my own specifications. I tried things the other way once.
Didn't like it at all."
   That "other way" was at Dallas, where Motta quit in 1987
after his team had posted a 55-27 mark, his best in seven
seasons there. "I found myself doing things against my
philosophy -- making compromises I shouldn't have," says the
man from Utah who 22 years ago coached in the first NBA game
he ever saw. "It didn't work for me, and it wouldn't have
worked for anybody for long. No job is worth that.
   "I want from my team what every other coach wants, which
is that they play each game like it was the seventh of a
championship playoff. Maybe the difference is that I expect
it instead of just hoping. People say the pro game has
changed, and it has. The players today are millionaires with
guaranteed contracts, and it's up to the coach to get them to
sacrifice their egos and function as a unit. It's tough, but
it's great when you can do it. I guess that's really why I'm
here."
   The "freshmen" that Motta is molding include 1990
first-round picks Lionel Simmons, a forward from LaSalle;
Travis Mays, a guard from Texas; Duane Causwell, a center
from Temple; and Anthony Bonner, a forward from St. Louis.
Forward Ricky Calloway, signed as a free agent out of Kansas,
gives the Kings five rookies.
   The most useful so far has been the snaky Simmons, who at
LaSalle accumulated the third-highest point tally in NCAA
history. He's been a starter averaging about 15 points a game
despite some erratic shooting. Mays, who some compare with
Joe Dumars of the champion Detroit Pistons, has done well
when back woes permitted. Bonner has had worse luck with
injuries, missing 17 games with a fractured foot, but has
shown exceptional speed and reflexes for a guy who's
6-foot-8. Causwell is a seven-footer who can shoot, but lacks
stamina.
   The Motta that's molding this crew has changed from his
earlier days. His signature tinted specs now are bifocals,
and he has tempered his formerly continual baiting of
officials to a point where he can occasionally joke with
them. ("Hey, Bill, check my guy for tooth marks," he remarked
to referee Bill Saar on Tuesday after he thought a foul had
gone in the wrong direction.) He thinks he's more open with
his players than he used to be, and more likely to pat their
fannies encouragingly than chew them verbally.
   Unchanged, however, is the Motta credo that hard work
cures all: Until last week he'd put the Kings through full
workouts every game day and two such sessions on off days, an
unheard-of regimen in the pros.
   The best return on that effort came Dec. 13, when the
Kings, owners of the league's worst record, upset the
Portland Trailblazers, who had the best. In Tuesday's
contest, which gave the Kings their first three-game win
streak since April 1989, Simmons had 14 third-quarter points,
Bonner had 18 and five steals, and Causwell made some key
plays.
   It was regular-season career victory 830 for Motta,
leaving him 108 behind Boston's Red Auerbach for top spot on
the NBA's coach's list. Motta says he'd like to set that mark
even though "it would be mostly because I coached longer than
Red, not better."
   He notes, wryly, that he's already done something rare in
NBA annals by posting his 800th career loss on Nov. 29
against Denver. "I told my kids we should have had a
champagne party to celebrate," he says. "How many coaches are
going to be in this league long enough to lose 800, and still
be working?"

Hibernia National Bank, New Orleans, offered through First
Boston Corp. at 99 21/32 to yield 8.459%. The yield is 125
basis points above the Treasury's two-year note. Underwriters
expect the offering to be rated triple-A by Moody's based on
the quality of the receivables and a letter of credit from
Union Bank of Switzerland covering 13% of the deal. An
average life of 1.62 years is expected, based on annual
prepayments of 1.3% of the original loan balance. Legal final

   Research Groups Home In on Two Genes
   That Increase the Risk of Breast Cancer
   ----

   Two research groups independently announced they had each
targeted a separate gene that makes some women prone to
developing breast cancer.
   The discoveries of the two genes strongly buttress the
growing belief that women born with one of several genes are
especially vulnerable to the cancer. The researchers said the
genes also are probably involved in noninherited cancers;
cancers can occur if the genes are somehow damaged during
life by exposure to an environmental substance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the scientists haven't actually isolated either of
the culprit genes -- they don't know the genes' chemical
structure, how they cause breast cancer or their normal role
in cells -- the new findings, reported together in this
week's issue of the journal Science, give scientists the
means to track down and identify these genes precisely.
   Someday, doctors may be able to use these genes to
determine whether a patient is at risk of getting breast
cancer, perhaps detecting a cancer at its earliest, most
treatable, stage. The findings may spur research into drugs
that blunt the genes' untoward behavior.
   In one of the studies, scientists at the University of
California, Berkeley found evidence strongly linking a gene
and breast cancer in women under age 45. These women all
belonged to families where the cancer was much more common
than in the general population. In fact, women who inherit
this gene have an 80% risk during their life of developing
cancer, as opposed to a 4% risk of breast cancer developing
for most other women.
   In the second report, researchers at the University of
Utah who also were studying families in which breast cancer
clustered densely, found that many of the women relatives had
a pre-cancerous condition that put them at high risk of
developing full-blown cancer. The condition, characterized by
aberrant but nonmalignant growth of breast tissue cells,
occurred among the women in several generations in a
frequency that was much like the inheritance of a trait
caused by a single gene.
   The new reports add to the bustle of cancer gene
discoveries during 1990. During the year scientists found
that most cancers arise when several genes within a cell
become defective. These genes appear to regulate growth, but
allow a cancer to advance if they are inactivated.
   Just a few weeks ago, scientists found that one of these
"tumor-suppressor" genes, called p53, could be inherited in a
defective state. Although the gene was found in families
where a rare form of cancer occurs in high numbers,
scientists believe the gene also may be involved in the
inheritance of other cancers -- particularly breast cancer.
   The study by Mary-Clare King and colleagues at
UC-Berkeley's School of Public Health uncovered the presence
of a gene located near p53, but unrelated to it. Ms. King
found the gene by studying genetic material from 146 women
with breast cancer in 23 families. Ms. King found that all
the women with cancer had a variation in their gene material,
or DNA, at a site on chromosome 17, while none of a large
group of healthy women in the family had the variation.
(There are 23 chromosomes containing all the genes that lie
in the nucleus of every cell.)
   "It's our sense that a defect to this chromosome 17 gene
is involved in the very early beginnings of a tumor
development," says Ms. King. "It's another patch in the quilt
of cancer genes."
   In the second study, Mark Skolnick and colleagues at the
University of Utah found that many healthy women in families
with frequent breast cancer have a condition called
proliferative breast disease. When the researchers combined
the results of the women with this condition with those of
the women who developed cancer, they found a pattern that
mimicked the inheritance of a single gene.

   CLEVELAND -- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. said it expects to post
a fourth-quarter gain of $47.1 million, or $4.03 a share, as
part of the reorganization of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Co.
   The gain reflects cash and stock payments to both
Cleveland-Cliffs and a Canadian iron ore joint venture
managed by the iron ore concern. In the 1989 fourth quarter,
Cleveland-Cliffs earned $13.3 million, or $1.12 a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh's reorganization plan was confirmed
this week in a federal bankruptcy court. Distributions to
creditors such as Cleveland-Cliffs will follow a 10-day
appeal period.
   Cleveland-Cliffs said pretax receipts are expected to
consist of $56 million in cash and 968,889 new
Wheeling-Pittsburgh common shares valued at $10.9 million.
Wabush Mines, a Canadian iron ore joint venture managed by
Cleveland-Cliffs, is expected to receive $39.7 million,
consisting of $33.3 million in cash and 568,889 shares.
Cleveland-Cliffs' indirect share will be $2.9 million after
tax, which will be retained in Wabush to fund capital
expenditures including a major emission-control project.
   Cleveland-Cliffs said its claims reflect damages incurred
when Wheeling-Pittsburgh rejected certain ore purchase
contracts and partnership obligations at the Tilden mine, a
Michigan iron ore facility managed by Cleveland-Cliffs, in
1985.

<LP>
   DALLAS -- Republic Health Corp. expects to report net
income of $1.1 million, or 19 cents a share, for the fiscal
first quarter ended Nov. 30, said Bryan P. Marsal, the
company's chief executive officer.
   In the year-earlier period, then privately held Republic
Health posted a loss of $38 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company expects to report that revenue increased 22%
to $118 million from $97 million, Mr. Marsal said.
   The company had expected its first-quarter earnings to be
"a little higher," Mr. Marsal said in an interview. But he
said the recent 2% reduction in Medicare reimbursements for
outpatient procedures resulted in narrower margins. Republic
Health owns or leases, and operates 13 acute-care hospitals
in six states, plus one surgery center.
   Looking ahead, Mr. Marsal said he expected the company to
stay profitable and to continue posting gains over last
year's results. But he said smaller-than-expected Medicare
reimbursements would continue putting a strain on earnings.
As a result, he said the company is attempting to cut costs,
as well as increase business from non-Medicare patients.
Medicare patients now account for 50% of the company's
business, Mr. Marsal said.
   The company is planning to open two more surgery centers
in Southern California, where its existing one operates, Mr.
Marsal said.
   The chief executive said he expected his company would
prove to be "recession insensitive." But he did say that in
hard times, patients may choose to do without elective
surgery.
   A year ago this month, Republic Health sought Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection to restructure total debt of about $645
million. When it emerged from bankruptcy court in May, its
total debt was reduced to $379 million, and bondholders owned
nearly 90% of its common; the rest was held by holders of the
old preferred and common stock.
   Now, the company has debt of about $350 million and equity
of about $42 million, Mr. Marsal said. He said the company
has no plans to pay dividends or issue additional stock.

   Scali, McCabe, Sloves, reeling from the loss of the Volvo
account and other client defections, named Patrick Fallon
vice chairman.
   The Minneapolis ad executive thus inherits the daunting
challenge of restoring the agency's tarnished reputation and
luring new clients to its flagship New York office. Mr.
Fallon, 45 years old, will continue as chairman of Fallon
McElligott, the Minneapolis shop that is majority owned by
Scali. But he will move to New York, assuming the role of top
account executive for the New York and Canada offices from
Marvin Sloves, the firm's chairman and chief executive.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Sloves, for his part, said he will now focus on
securing a deal to remove his agency from WPP Group, which
assumed control of Scali in 1989. Although WPP Chief Martin
Sorrell has said publicly that he would allow Scali to buy
itself back, negotiations have stalled repeatedly over
financing details. A newly formed board of directors, staffed
by executives at Scali and some of its U.S. units, is
expected to help get a buy-out completed.
   The decision to bring in Mr. Fallon, co-founder of one of
the hottest creative agencies of the 1980s, as leader of
Scali's rescue mission follows a disastrous year at Scali. By
far the most damaging loss was the $40 million Volvo account,
resigned after it was revealed a Scali-created ad was rigged.
(Scali executives have said they didn't do anything wrong.)
Since then, executives at the company and its U.S.
subsidiaries have had extensive discussions behind closed
doors to determine just what to do next.
   "What New York needs is someone to work with Sam {Scali}
and give the office some fresh perspective," Mr. Sloves said.
"We've all decided that Pat is the guy for the job. We're
going to give him the real authority to do whatever it takes
to make this the great vibrant agency it was a year ago."
(Mr. Scali is the agency's world-wide creative director.)
   That won't be easy. Billings at Scali's New York office
have dropped to about $200 million from $280 million two
years ago, with account losses such as Lotus Development and
Toys "R" Us. The shop also lost Nikon's $12 million account
after the agency inadvertently ran magazine ads for a new
camera before Nikon was able to introduce it to dealers.
   Mr. Sloves stressed, however, that the problems are
limited to the New York office and noted that the other ad
agencies in Scali's self-named "confederation" are healthy.
He noted, for example, that the agency in Mexico doubled its
billings this year and billings in France have grown 50%.
   One of Mr. Fallon's first moves will be to bring in a
big-name creative executive to lead the New York office and
work with Mr. Scali. That person will succeed Bob Levenson,
who will retire at the end of the year. Mr. Fallon said he
believes he will be able to make the moves necessary to put
the agency back on its feet. "I have a record of making tough
decisions and not being equivocal once they're made," he
said.
   Mr. Fallon insisted Fallon McElligott, known for its
clever ads for Rolling Stone magazine and Porsche, can
operate sufficiently with him on a part-time basis, saying
there is other strong management in place. Steven Sjoblad,
for example, has been president of the agency for four years,
he said. Furthermore, Mr. Fallon said he hopes to spend more
time in Minneapolis when a turnaround at Scali materializes.
"I'm not going to abandon Minneapolis," he said.
"Emotionally, I'm not capable of doing that."
   Still, questions remain as to whether taking Mr. Fallon
away from his agency to help save Scali is a smart move.
Fallon McElligott itself suffered a public-relations
nightmare three years ago and has just recently stabilized.
In that instance, the press got hold of some smart-aleck
responses the agency sent to a woman who accused it of
creating a sexist ad for the TV show "Dynasty." Mr. Fallon
said that incident has given him "some experience dealing
with unsettling situations."
   Meanwhile, a Federal Trade Commission investigation of the
Volvo ad continues. The ad showed a pickup truck driving over
the top of a row of cars, crushing the roofs of every one
except the Volvo. The Volvo, though, had a roof reinforced
with lumber and steel and the Texas Attorney General charged
that the pillars of the other cars in the commercial were
severed or weakened.
   Yesterday, Mr. Sloves sent letters -- approved by his
lawyers after the agency's own investigation -- to clients
and agency partners absolving Scali from any wrongdoing. "No
one from Scali, McCabe, Sloves gave instructions for or
authorized any alteration to any car . . . the evidence on
that point is clear," Mr. Sloves wrote.
   Mr. Sloves said that while working out a buy-back
agreement with Mr. Sorrell is his No. 1 priority, he is also
eager to begin further development on the shop's
international network. "Here we are on Dec. 20, and we are
still 80%-owned by Martin Sorrell," Mr. Sloves said. "Action
is required."

   Dollar-Buying Scramble Follows News
   Of Shevardnadze's Sudden Resignation

   NEW YORK -- The dollar rocketed higher in a market shaken
by the prospect of a political crisis in the Soviet Union.
   The mark took the brunt of the selling, as participants
shied away from European currencies and sought the U.S.
currency as a haven.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unnerving what had been a relatively calm market was
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's resignation
announcement early in the European morning. Warning that "a
dictatorship is in the offing" for the Soviet Union, Mr.
Shevardnadze lashed out at the nation's authoritarian
political mood.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.5115 marks, up sharply from 1.4785 marks late Wednesday in
New York. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 135.85
yen, up from 134.05 yen in New York late Wednesday. Sterling
was trading at $1.8930, down from $1.9305.
   In mid-morning trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was
quoted at 135.90 yen, up from its Tokyo close Thursday of
134.58 yen.
   The news of Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation elicited worry
from world leaders as well as from financial markets, which
were forced to focus on the economic, financial and ethnic
problems threatening to undermine Mr. Gorbachev's rule.
   "This is really the spark that reminds the market that
Russia is in very serious trouble," said Ezra Zask, senior
vice president and foreign-exchange manager at Mellon Bank in
Pittsburgh. "It took something like this to remind us, and it
will put a serious dent in the mark's luster for quite a
while," if there are serious repercussions.
   Because of Germany's proximity to the Soviet Union and its
prominent role in the reconstruction of Central and Eastern
Europe, the mark had been the chief beneficiary of optimism
about the region. Consequently, it stands to lose the most
from fears that that the high hopes were premature.
   Beyond the fear that the Soviet Union will experience
difficulties, this upheaval in the Soviet leadership feeds
anxieties that "the whole Eastern Europe thing could be
unwound," said David Gilmore, foreign-exchange analyst at
McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei in New York. Furthermore, if Mr.
Gorbachev's foothold slips, the warmer relationship
established between the superpowers might be called into
question, he said.
   Meanwhile, the Persian Gulf imbroglio continued to
intimidate dollar sellers. White House Spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater reiterated that the Iraqis must be held to the Jan.
15 deadline to withdraw from Kuwait, while the Pentagon
issued a warning to Iraq's Saddam Hussein that U.S. air units
will be ready to attack on Jan. 15, even if all ground forces
aren't. The Pentagon's remarks followed indications from the
deputy commander of the U.S. forces in the Gulf that ground
troops wouldn't be prepared to attack Iraq for several weeks
after Jan. 15.
   While the market continues to consider global
interest-rate differentials and economic fundamentals -- two
factors that make the mark attractive -- unrest in the Soviet
Union and the Gulf situation are eclipsing those
considerations. Exacerbating the sharpness of the move
against the mark was the heavy overload of mark positions
accumulated in the market.
   The market's moves were exaggerated by its thinness. Even
small orders had a disproportionately large effect on
exchange rates, traders said. Technical resistance points,
therefore, had less significance.
   The yen showed less vulnerablility to the dollar's
upswing, with 135.00 yen serving as a strong cap for most of
the global trading day.
   A half-hour before the end of New York trading, however,
the dollar suddenly gained half a yen, bounding from just
below 135.00 yen to around 135.50 yen. By the end of the
trading day, the dollar had risen to its intraday high of
135.85 yen.
   "There were rumors of a large order to sell at 135 yen and
a stop-loss just above it," said a dealer at a Japanese bank
in New York. As soon as 135 level was breached, the stop-loss
order was triggered, sending the dollar shooting up half a
yen in just a few minutes.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $385.20 an ounce, down 80 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was trading at
$382 an ounce.

   One of our recently returned hostages told a story about a
band of Iraqi soldiers who burst into the apartment of an
American official in Kuwait City. Hungry and thirsty after a
hot, sweaty day of pillaging and expropriating, they found
several bottles of white wine loose in the cupboard. They
removed the corks in traditional fashion -- by smashing the
necks off the bottles -- and then ransacked the place for
food, settling at last on a package of Gainesburger dog-food
patties. Peeling off the snug cellophane wrappers, they
gently sauteed the little pucks of horseflesh, adding perhaps
a splash of Worcestershire and a dash of MSG as a tenderizer.
All evidence suggests the young men went away deeply
impressed with Yank cuisine.
   Some people think this story is disgusting, but that's
because some people haven't been reading, as I have, a book
by David Steinman called "Diet for a Poisoned Planet: How to
Choose Safe Foods for You and Your Family" (Harmony, 392
pages, $21.95). The Iraqis' devil-may-care attitude toward
victuals evokes an earlier America. Once there was a country
that wowed the world with its scrapple, its blood sausage,
its head cheese. That country was ours, and it is gone. The
culinary derring-do of our forefathers has been replaced by
the phobias of a new generation of Americans who worry about
calories, chemical additives, pesticides.

<TEXT>
   These are the readers for whom Mr. Steinman writes. "Diet
for a Poisoned Planet" is not, technically speaking, a diet
book; fretful fatties will be disappointed. Nor is it a
cookbook; it contains no recipes. And by no stretch of the
imagination is it a book of science. Ironically, the first
stupid statement in this book is not made by Mr. Steinman but
by one William Marcus, who is a scientist at, God help us,
the Environmental Protection Agency.
   "Cancer, we are told, is decreasing," he writes in the
foreward. This is simply not true . . . Cancer deaths have
risen from less than 1 percent of all deaths in the
nineteenth century to at least one out of five deaths (20
percent) in the U.S. today."
   Now, even an EPA scientist should be able to recognize
that this percentage increase is a slender datum indeed,
accounted for by several factors. Fewer people today die of,
say, tuberculosis and diphtheria than 100 years ago; hence a
proportionately higher number die of cancer. The likelihood
of cancer increases with old age, and as people live longer
the incidence of cancer increases. People smoke more tobacco;
they stay out in the sun too long; morbidity reporting among
doctors has vastly improved . . .
   Blah, blah, blah. Mr. Steinman is having none of it. There
is but a single cause for increased cancer deaths, he has
decided: the pesticides injected into a generous-bosomed
Mother Nature by a species ( Homo sapiens americanus) gone
cockeyed with hubris. The affable apple, the pulchritudinous
peach, the congenial cantaloupe -- all are drenched in long,
unspellable words that have at least one "z" in them. (In Mr.
Steinman's lexicon, plants treated with pesticides are always
"drenched," except in those cases when they're "saturated.")
   Even those among the new generation of Americans who share
his phobias -- who consider a Double Whopper and a
Gainesburger to be brothers under the wrapper -- will find
Mr. Steinman a remorseless counselor. Think you're neat
'cause you eat whole wheat? Guess again. "Wheat is heavily
sprayed both before and after harvest." He recommends
alternative wholegrain breads, which, when properly baked,
taste as if they're molded from birdseed mulch. You're proud
of all those fresh fruits you're eating? Moron. "Peaches are
dangerous. They're right up there with apples." And raisins?
Don't ask.
   "Sometimes," he writes, "it seems that nothing is safe to
eat, and that we live in a constant state of food anxiety."
Perfectly put. Indeed, the first few pages are enough to send
a credulous reader -- Mr. Steinman writes as if he expects no
other kind -- into a mealtime catalepsy. But any number of
biochemists could argue with the science of this book, and
win, by pointing out, for example, that well over 99% of the
pesticides we ingest are produced by plants themselves; or
that the animal-carcinogenicity tests from which Mr. Steinman
claims to draw his anxiety are now regarded as highly
dubious; or that the amount of pesticides taken in by the
average Americano is unimaginably small.
   Alas, Mr. Steinman's anxiety is impervious to scientific
reasoning because it is the science itself that makes him
anxious; his unease over technology is instinctive, a matter
of reflex. And sooner or later, he really wears you down.
Food anxiety is contagious because it plays on the darkest
forces in our personality, bloating the already debilitating
fears of the worry wart, the party pooper, the whiner.
Somewhere between "Plant Foods" and "The NonToxic Home," I
too felt myself succumbing to Mr. Steinman's fears about
"subtle neurotoxic effects." But then I found myself
contemplating a dinner consisting entirely of puffed millet
and mung beans, and snapped out of it quickly enough.

   TOKYO -- Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. said it was so
concerned about U.S. reaction to its purchase of MCA Inc.
that it was prepared to end negotiations if a major political
backlash occurred.
   Masahiko Hirata, the Matsushita executive vice president
who led the company's talks with MCA, said at a news
conference that Matsushita told MCA that if anti-Japanese
sentiment "was going to become a very big issue, we weren't
going to proceed" with the negotiations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Hirata said Matsushita's specific plans for the U.S.
entertainment company, which it agreed last month to acquire
for about $66 a share, or about $6.59 billion, won't be
completed until the takeover is officially finalized,
probably early next month. He reiterated that a main reason
for the MCA purchase was to strengthen development of
Matsushita's high-definition television hardware.
   Matsushita has consistently maintained that it will take a
hands-off approach in managing MCA. While both companies will
form an executive committee to devise strategies, Mr. Hirata
said, only a few Matsushita employees will be transferred to
MCA's California headquarters. Akio Tanii, Matsushita's
62-year-old president, recently said the company won't
interfere with the creative independence of MCA's film
producers.

   MATSUSHITA ELECTRIC INDUSTRIAL Co. had been concerned,
before completing negotiations last month, that a political
backlash in the U.S. could kill its pending acquisition of

   Poor Regions Uneasy on European Unity

   New Policies May Hurt
   Areas Like Southern Italy

   ISERNIA, Italy -- Tucked into the rocky hills of Molise,
the apparel factory of Manifatture Ittierre S.p.A. forms a
monument to the Italian government's generosity.
   Working in marble and glass offices, designers toy with
new fashion concepts on multicolor computer screens.
State-of-the-art cutting machines slice through swaths of
cloth, then feed segments to stitching devices that turn them
into Trussardi jeans and other garments. In a vast packaging
room, robot-assisted assembly lines box shipments destined

<TEXT>
   "The Italian government was responsible for 70% of the
building and expansion costs" over the past decade, says
Antonio Arcaro, the plant's general director. And the
operation is spared all but about 15% of the social-security
taxes other enterprises normally pay. Similar arrangements
proliferate throughout the Mezzogiorno, Italy's
underdeveloped South.
   But whether such largess will continue is in doubt. One
byproduct of the European Community's rapid program of
unification is that the poorer regions are facing new
hardships. Earlier this month, EC leaders met in Rome and
formally launched a treaty-amending conference to pave the
way toward a single currency and central banking authority.
But the push toward unity brings with it a dose of hardship:
Italy will come under pressure to shrink its mammoth budget
deficit and to cut the $10 billion or so it transfers to the
South each year. The Mezzogiorno, like other less developed
regions, could fall even further behind the more prosperous
European economies.
   The ramifications reach well beyond the comparatively
deprived areas themselves. Big disparities in income, living
standards and inflation levels make it harder for the EC to
build a cohesive economic block, bound together by a single
currency and a central monetary policy. As the gaps widen,
the community will face the choice of slowing its push toward
unification or doling out more money to the poorer regions.
   Adding to the potential disruptions in the
monetary-integration effort is the general slowdown in the
world economy and the jolts arising from higher oil prices.
"Discord is fueled by recessions," notes Richard O'Brien,
chief economist with American Express Bank in London. "The
halcyon days of the EC are in times of economic growth.
Remember that when we hit the 1970s, unity disappeared."
   The buzzword for the catch-up therapy the EC's poorer
regions are seeking is "economic convergence." Among those
most in need are southern Italy, Greece and parts of
Portugal, Spain and Ireland.
   Despite Europe's eight-year economic expansion, many
regions, like the Mezzogiorno, still lag behind the EC's
prosperous center. Grants and subsidies from Rome have
enticed such global giants as International Business Machines
Corp., Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. and Unilever PLC into the
Mezzogiorno. Still, Italy remains a divided nation
economically. Unemployment in the South is running at about
21.3% -- more than three times the 5.8% level in Italy's
North. Each year, the Mezzogiorno sees a net outmigration of
50,000 people, as the young flock northward for jobs.
   More broadly, EC figures show a discouraging trend: The 25
richest and 25 poorest regions in the community were slightly
further apart in per-capita income at the end of 1988 than
they were in 1980. (EC officials point out that many of the
neediest areas are in Greece, whose economy deteriorated
during the 1980s and pulled down the average.)
   For the poorer regions -- which have depended on subsidies
and, often, currency devaluations to keep going -- it will be
a shock to shift to an economic and monetary union in which
the staunchly anti-inflationary Bundesbank dictates
priorities. "The South of Italy has a weak economic
structure," says Stefano Micossi, chief economist with
Cofindustria, an industry association in Rome. "It's not
clear how, under current policies, it could stand the impact
of open markets and monetary union."
   By all accounts, efforts to lessen such strains will drive
up the EC's costs. "Poorer countries could find that economic
and monetary union could damage them rather than help them,"
says Bruce Millan, the EC's regional commissioner. Part of
the price of full European integration, he argues, must be a
"greater transfer of resources to the poorer regions."
   To this end, the European Regional Development Fund -- the
EC's main vehicle for helping out poorer areas -- is being
doubled, to about $68 billion. The money will be spent over
the next four years on such projects as roads and industrial
parks. But EC officials say this increase is probably much
too small, and there is talk of another doubling before full
monetary union comes into effect.
   Locking the entire community into a single currency
guarded by staunchly anti-inflationary central bankers is
indeed certain to cause pain in the poorest regions.
Historically, developing economies have kept their currencies
cheap so that they could build up exports while they
modernized their industries. A single currency takes away
that option.
   Meanwhile, there would be a single interest rate for the
EC. If the economy got overheated in the EC's developed core,
the central bank would likely increase interest rates for the
entire community -- even though such a move would hit harder
on the less developed periphery, where unemployment is
already much higher than in the center.
   No one can say how severe these setbacks will be or how
much the EC will end up doling out to alleviate the
hardships. In the Mezzogiorno, there are worries that the EC
won't be as generous as the Italian government has been,
particularly if Portugal, Greece and other regions are
competing for funds.
   Another problem for southern Italy is organized crime,
which often gets involved in how public funds are spent.
   Notwithstanding the tough times that many predict, support
for European integration is strong in Italy. Italians favor
common European policies, including a single currency, by a
wider margin than any other nation, EC polls show.
   "We are optimistic by nature," says Mariano D'Antonio,
head of Monitor Srl, an economic research firm in Naples.
"What is urgent, we do immediately; what is impossible, we do
tomorrow; what requires a miracle -- we try to prepare
ourselves."
   Nonetheless, Mr. D'Antonio thinks the Mezzogiorno and
other less developed regions will be in for a shock when
monetary union actually comes. "Few people are aware," he
says. "Under monetary union, the prevailing view will be the
Bundesbank's. They refuse to finance large government
deficits or to finance governments' transfers to enterprises.
They refuse to finance governments' transfers to poor
households."
   He goes on to predict that under the "dictatorship" of
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl there will be higher
unemployment and reduced government support.
   At the Bank of Italy, officials strongly support the move
to a unified monetary policy dominated by the Bundesbank.
Says one official, "What our politicians haven't been able to
achieve in 20 years, Europe or Mr. Poehl can achieve for us"
-- namely, a smaller budget deficit and a stronger currency.

   FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- General Electric Co. said it is
conducting an internal company investigation in connection
with an alleged kickback scheme involving Israeli purchases
of U.S. weapons.
   As reported in the Washington Post yesterday, police in
Israel are investigating the Israeli air force procurement of
military equipment from U.S. contractors. The allegations are
that millions of dollars in kickbacks were siphoned off to
senior Israeli military officials who helped cover up
procurement fraud.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   General Electric, which supplied jet engines for Israeli
fighter planes, was one U.S. company cited in Israeli press
accounts of the allegations, according to the Washington
Post. The reports identified Herbert B. Steindler, a GE
executive, as having been the manager in charge of company
sales to the Israeli air force.
   "GE has become aware of the investigation by the Israeli
government," said a GE spokesman. "The company has initiated
its own internal investigation concerning the purchase orders
said to be involved in the Israeli investigation." He said GE
has informed the U.S. government of its actions, adding that
"GE is cooperating fully with the U.S. government
investigation."
   The spokesman declined to comment on when GE learned of
the allegations or when it began its own investigation.

   BUSH SHOWS little inclination for bold tax or budget
moves.
   He won't decide till early January whether to push a
package of tax cuts and reduced benefits for the upper class
-- but aides bet he won't do it. Some advisers suggest
waiting until after the budget and State of the Union before
deciding whether to submit a recession-fighting package later
in the spring.

   Darman focuses on changing spending priorities only at the
margin. He rejects NASA's bid for a new shuttle orbiter, but
allows some low-cost pilot projects like a new Justice
anti-violent-crime program. The economic slump and the cost
of Desert Shield will send the deficit soaring, but the new
budget law doesn't require any remedial action -- and neither
Bush nor Congress is in the mood to try.
   "I don't anticipate that 1991 will be a deficit-reduction
year -- happily," says Senate Budget Chairman Sasser.
                                                                                                       

   REPUBLICAN STRIFE spreads to the Senate, depressing Dole.
   The minority leader and his brand of senior,
compromise-oriented lawmakers are under mounting pressure
from conservatives such as Lott, Nickles and Kasten, who want
a more partisan and confrontational approach on issues such
as taxes and spending. Witnesses say an angry exchange
erupted between Dole and Wallop at last month's leadership
elections.
   Dole is so vexed that he has privately talked with other
senators about retiring rather than seeking re-election to
the Senate in 1992. But his aides dismiss the retirement
talk, pointing to his recent forays to Kansas as hardly the
activities of a lame duck.
                                                                                                       

   LATIN LEADERS blow huge holes in Bush's regional anti-drug
strategy.
   Even as he hails progress in the war on drugs, his highly
touted "Andean initiative" is crumbling. Colombia's
government is offering sharply reduced sentences and immunity
from extradition to the U.S. to traffickers who turn
themselves in; U.S. officials watch anxiously to see whether
Medellin cartel leader Fabio Ochoa, who just surrendered,
gets away with a wrist-slap.
   Meanwhile, "we aren't where we want to be" in Peru, admits
acting U.S. drug czar John Walters. The military periodically
blocks police from executing joint raids with American drug
agents; President Fujimori refuses U.S. military aid, saying
his country needs economic help instead. And Bolivia's
president refuses to give a big anti-drug role to his
nation's coup-happy military.
   A House Government Operations Committee report to be
released today says the U.S. strategy is "failing."
                                                                                                       

   A WHITE HOUSE SHUFFLE is likely in the next few months,
aimed both at fixing the staff machinery and at laying the
groundwork for 1992. One big problem: counsel Boyden Gray's
broad interpretation of the ethics law, which helped push
Bennett out of the GOP chairmanship and could hinder some
aides' move to the campaign. A heated internal debate over
Gray's interpretation is under way.
                                                                                                       

   HOUSE DEMOCRATS mull plans to give tax relief to the
middle class through an expanded IRA deduction, an increase
in the standard deduction or cuts in Social Security payroll
taxes. They also consider a possible anti-recession package,
perhaps using as a vehicle the pending reauthorization of the
highway bill.
                                                                                                       

   CONGRESSIONAL ANGER grows over allies' marginal support
for Gulf operations. Both Senate and House budget panels plan
hearings early next year. Wisconsin Rep. Obey notes that
given the extra oil being pumped at inflated prices, "The
Saudis are still going to wind up when this is over having
made money on the whole problem."
                                                                                                       

   CHOPPING BLOCK? House Democrats say Rep. Jacobs may be
ousted from his chairmanship of the Ways and Means Social
Security subcommittee by the House Democratic Caucus. The
reason: to punish him for his support of the proposed
capital-gains tax cut last year.
                                                                                                       

   NO REPRIEVE: Weapons-buyers feel a huge squeeze despite
the Gulf crisis.
   To protect personnel and training accounts, Joint Chiefs
chairman Powell warns the services to slash their five-year
procurement wish-list. Some big projects will have to be
killed in 1992 because money isn't earmarked for them in
later years. The Air Force alone may have to shrink by almost
1,000 planes and cut about $50 billion from its procurement
plans through 1997.
   Weapons likely to face the ax include the Air Force's
F-16, which could face a production cutoff, and the Navy's
proposed high-tech replacement for carrier-based F-14
fighters. The Navy's A-12 attack plane is certain to be
delayed. The Army also faces deep cuts in armored vehicles.
   Florida Rep. Ireland and other Pentagon critics draft a
bill requiring independent audit teams to validate the
services' cost projections.

   Expects Increase
   In Quarter's Net

   Earnings Are Seen Reaching
   $46 Million in 4th Period,
   Lifted by Thrift Results

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
CONTAINERS &amp; PACKAGING, BAGS, CANS, BOXES (CTR)

<LP>
   DIBOLL, Texas -- Temple-Inland Inc., bolstered by its
thrift operations, expects to report net income of $46
million to $50 million, for the fourth quarter, up from $44
million last year, said Clifford J. Grum, president and chief
executive officer.
   Mr. Grum said in an interview that the estimated earnings
gain reflects better performance in its thrift business and
the inclusion, for the first time, of its Guaranty Federal
Savings Bank unit in its results. Temple-Inland's financial
services sector is expected to report a $10 million to $12
million operating profit, compared with a year-ago operating
loss, while the company's manufacturing unit's operating
earnings are expected to decline 30% to 40% from a year ago,
to $44 million to $52 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition to better performance from its thrift
businesses, Temple-Inland also received tax benefits from its
thrift purchases that reduced its 1990 tax rate to about 13%
from 34% last year, Mr. Grum said.
   Temple-Inland is estimating that per-share earnings will
be 83 cents to 90 cents for the quarter, compared with 80
cents last year. The year-ago results have been restated to
exclude two insurance companies that were sold.
   Fourth-quarter revenue is expected to rise about 21%, to
$593 million from $489 million. Manufacturing operations
account for about $500 million, while the inclusion of
Guaranty makes up most of the remainder of the increase, Mr.
Grum said.
   Mr. Grum said that volume has been strong in its
container, containerboard, pulp and paperboard businesses,
but costs have been rising. A $30 price increase early in the
quarter to $410 per ton of linerboard failed to stick,
eroding margins, he said.
   The company's building products division, which includes
lumber and particleboard products, however, has been hurt by
the decline in home building and by a decline in residential
repairs and remodeling. The "building materials {business} is
not just in a recession. It may be in a depression," he said.
   In contrast, Wayne McDonald, Temple-Inland's chief
financial officer, said the company's two thrifts are
growing, and benefiting from a sharp decline in foreclosures
and an increase in loan closings. Mr. McDonald said that
costs related to foreclosures will drop to about $5 million
this year from $11 million last year. At the same time, the
company's thrifts made about $560 million in loans, compared
with less than $300 million in 1989. The thrifts also have
reduced brokered deposits, lowering their cost of funds.
   Mr. Grum said that he can't currently predict that the
company will post another earnings gain in 1991 given the
current state of the economy.
   For 1990, the company is expected to report net income of
$230 million to $234 million, or $4.15 to $4.22 a share,
compared with 1989 net income of $207.4 million, or $3.75 a
share. Financial services operating earnings are expected to
be about $50 million to $52 million, including about $34
million from Guaranty Federal, while manufacturing operating
profit is expected to be $250 million to $258 million.
   Revenue is expected to rise to $2.4 billion from $1.9
billion, largely because of the inclusion of Guaranty
Federal's results.
   Mr. Grum said he believes the financial services group
will have a record year in 1991 that "should allow the
company's overall results to be very favorable compared to
most of our competition." But he said, "if you wired me to
the wall, I think both building products and paper would be
down next year." In addition, because some tax credits were
unique to this year, the company's tax rate will increase to
about 20% next year, he said.
   After next year, the future of those tax credits isn't
clear. Because of criticism that some buyers of failed Texas
thrifts like Temple-Inland got bargains under the so-called
Southwest Plan, Mr. Grum said that he expects "sometime next
year we will sit down with regulators" to discuss the
agreement. However, he said he doesn't know whether anything
will come out of any discussions.
   In 1991, Temple-Inland is expected to spend about $350
million in capital expenditures, up from $325 million this
year. The company will start up its new linerboard and
bleached board product, called White Top, late next year. In
addition, it is expanding its bleached paperboard mill in
Evadale, Texas, scheduled for completion in 1992, and is
building a recycled paper mill in Maysville, Ky., that is
expected to open in 1993.
   Partly because of capital spending and partly because of
thrift acquisitions, Temple-Inland's long-term debt will
increase to about $560 at year-end from about $390 million
last year. Mr. Grum said the company probably will add to its
debt next year, possibly by selling senior debt through
private placements to institutions.

   Disclosure of Current Securities Values
   Held by Firms Is Gaining Momentum

   NEW YORK -- Moves by accounting standard-setters to keep
the public more up-to-date on the value of company assets and
debt are gaining steam.
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board has just proposed
requiring corporations to give current market values in
financial-statement footnotes for securities and investments,
generally starting in 1991. For companies with less than $100
million in assets, the disclosure must begin in 1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Also, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee, a
rule-making unit of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, has just issued a rule requiring
financial institutions to show unrealized gains and losses in
their bond portfolios in financial-statement disclosures.
   Many businessmen, particularly bankers, contend that these
measures, which would cover loans, are too costly and
confusing. They say that the reports will be very difficult
to produce.
   "It's disclosure overkill," says David Locke, president of
the $300 million-asset McFarland State Bank in McFarland,
Wis. "For us to figure out the value of all our 400 loans,
many to local businessmen, would be a ludicrous exercise
hardly worth doing every year."
   Despite such complaints, the standard-setters are still
initiating such disclosure projects because of heavy pressure
from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC wants
all companies and particularly financial institutions to give
more current data on assets to avoid debacles like those in
the thrift industry.
   In January, the FASB, the chief rule-making body for
accountants, plans to begin considering whether to mark to
current market prices certain securities, particularly bonds,
held by financial institutions. This project is particularly
upsetting to banks, many of which have long been trading with
their bond portfolios and using original-cost values to keep
losses down.
   Current accounting rules say that if a financial
institution is holding debt to maturity, it may hold that
debt at original cost. But if the debt is held in a trading
account, it must be marked to market, which could produce big
losses or gains when the market moves sharply.
   Pat McConnell, managing director of Bear Stearns &amp; Co.,
who writes an accounting newsletter for the securities firm,
says the efforts to force companies and banks to mark
securities and other assets to market "will bring a firestorm
of protest." She adds: "That's because some assets, such as
private placements, are very difficult to value."
   Bankers say that such disclosures for local bond issues,
loans and other bank assets can be a "nightmare." Small
bankers "are very opposed to such disclosure rules because
they're too costly and would be devastating to banks, which
already are beset with many economic problems," says Diane
Casey, executive director of the 6,200-member Independent
Bankers Association of America in Washington, D.C.
   The latest FASB proposal requiring current market value
disclosure in footnotes is set to be made a rule by the 1991
fourth quarter, after public comment, officials of the
Norwalk, Conn.-based FASB say.

   Former Hizzoner Ed Koch didn't think much of "The Bonfire
of the Vanities" in his movie review on our Leisure &amp; Arts
page. As the movie opens today, don't expect to see many
testimonials from the other suspected models for characters
in the book. The real-life tough Bronx Judge Burton Roberts
calls the movie a "farce." The Rev. Al Sharpton (Rev.
Reginald Bacon in the book) told the New York Post it was a
"perfect racist plot." There are no reports so far from any
of the likely models for the Wall Street Master of the
Universe or from any overzealous former prosecutors.
   For his part, author Tom Wolfe has kept mum about what
Hollywood in the 1990s did to his vision of New York in the
'80s. He apparently took the sage advice to book authors on
how to sell movie rights: Make an appointment at the Nevada
border, toss the manuscript over, never set foot in
California, and go back to writing.

   BankAmerica Looks to Dominate West

   Acquisition of Thrifts Expected
   In New Mexico, Other States

   BankAmerica Corp. is preparing for a holiday feast
featuring some of the biggest turkeys in the savings and loan
industry.
   The resurgent banking company, which all year has been
gobbling up small banks and defunct thrifts, now is shopping
around in Texas and New Mexico as well as its home turf of
California, senior BankAmerica executives say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The current offerings on the menu consist of the
Resolution Trust Corp.'s list of failed thrifts. Among the
candidates being eyed by BankAmerica officials are such
thrift disasters as Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan
Association in Irvine, Calif.; Dallas-based Southwest Savings
Association, which failed twice, and New Mexico's biggest
dud, ABQ Bank. Some officials say BankAmerica may strike a
deal in the next few weeks.
   BankAmerica's moves into Texas and New Mexico would be its
first major thrusts into those states. Together with its
continued search for California institutions, the actions
signal a marked escalation of BankAmerica's expansionist
policy. They also indicate that BankAmerica isn't very
worried about possible losses on its California construction
loans, an exposure that troubles some bank analysts.
   BankAmerica already has shown it is willing to outspend
its rivals to buy out-of-state market share. It paid rich
premiums -- some say too rich -- in outgunning competitors
such as Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Security Pacific Corp. in
recent bidding over the remains of failed thrifts in
Washington and Arizona. Just last week, it bought a failed
thrift in Nevada.
   "We see an opportunity, and we are seizing it," says Frank
Newman, BankAmerica's chief financial officer. Adds another
BankAmerica senior officer: "Just take the RTC list, and
circle every one in the West or Southwest, and the odds are
probably three-to-one that BankAmerica has a bid in on it."
   Driving BankAmerica's binge is chief executive officer
Richard Rosenberg's belief that the failed thrifts present
BankAmerica with a chance to dominate the West, something it
lost during the mid-1980s, when BankAmerica's own problems
forced it to shrink significantly to survive. Between 1985
and 1987, BankAmerica had losses of $1.8 billion, and its
regional ambitions stalled. For instance, it was pressured by
regulators to abandon an agreement to buy an Oregon bank.
   But Mr. Rosenberg, who as head of the bank's retail
operations was instrumental in restoring the bank to
profitability before becoming chief executive in April, sees
an aggressive acquisition campaign as pivotal to his plan to
make BankAmerica the West's retail banking powerhouse.
   "The goal is to extend our reach throughout the West,"
says Mr. Newman. "We want to be pre-eminent."
   Some bankers see risk in BankAmerica's approach. For one
thing, many of the areas into which BankAmerica is moving --
Arizona, for example -- still are economically weak. And
Nevada, though among the fastest-growing states, has the kind
of one-horse economy that makes some bankers nervous.
   "If the casino and tourist trade fades there, poof, there
goes Nevada's economy," says one West Coast banker.
   Rivals such as First Interstate and Security Pacific
already have bought the banks with number one or number two
market share in one or two states. Others have such low
populations that market share might not mean much. Mr.
Rosenberg himself once professed little interest in
low-population states such as Oregon, noting that the average
increase in California's population every two years equaled
Oregon's entire population.
   Moreover, some industry executives believe BankAmerica is
paying too much for its acquisitions. Robert H. Smith,
Security Pacific's chief executive, has said it doesn't make
economic sense to pay more than 4% of the total deposits
purchased when buying failed thrifts. BankAmerica paid a
so-called deposit premium of 4.3%, or $81 million, to buy the
remains of Phoenix-based Merabank. Its premium on its $162.3
million acquisition of Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings &amp;
Loan Association, Portland, Ore., amounted to 6.85% of that
institution's core deposits. People familiar with the bidding
for Benjamin Franklin say BankAmerica's offer topped Security
Pacific's by $50 million.
   BankAmerica's Mr. Newman dismisses such criticism. "We've
lost the bidding on some institutions, so some people might
say we underpaid in those cases," he says. "We analyzed the
expected profit stream very carefully, and our capital
strength and financial position puts us in position to do
these deals."
   Indeed, BankAmerica has built its tangible common equity
ratio to 4.67% of assets, the second-highest capital ratio
among the nation's ten largest banks. Its profits remain
robust. For the nine months, it earned $828 million, or $3.66
a share.
   Beyond that, BankAmerica's cash outlays in these
acquisitions are tiny compared to its $109 billion of assets.
And Mr. Newman notes that its risks are reduced by retaining
few if any of the failed thrift's problem assets. The
government retains most such assets in these deals.
   BankAmerica's current prospects, bank executives say,
include New Mexico's largest defunct thrifts, ABQ Bank and
Sandia Federal Savings Association. Both are based in
Albuquerque. ABQ has $970 million of deposits; Sandia has
$950 million of deposits. Investment bankers expect bids for
the two institutions to come in at about $40 million for
each.
   In Texas, BankAmerica is believed to be eyeing Southwest,
notorious in thrift lore for being bailed out twice because
regulators' first effort to fix it didn't hold. It has $3.9
billion of deposits.
   Among other potential Texas targets:
   Commonwealth Federal Savings Association of Houston, which
has $1.71 billion of deposits; and Benjamin Franklin FSA of
Houston, which has $1.66 billion of deposits. The bidding in
Texas is expected to be spirited because of the state's size
and its slow but apparently steady rebound from the statewide
depression triggered by the collapse of oil prices beginning
in 1985. BankAmerica executives say it is also looking to
shore up its California base by mulling bids on what's left
of Lincoln, and Imperial Federal Savings Association, San
Diego, another spectacular California thrift failure. Lincoln
has deposits of about $2.4 billion and Imperial has deposits
of $4.8 billion.

   Chevron to Take
   A $220 Million
   Charge for Quarter

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Chevron Corp. said it expects to take a
$220 million special after-tax charge related to the planned
disposal of its fertilizer operations against fourth-quarter
profit.
   The oil giant said last month that it began actively
seeking offers for the operations, which had 1989 revenue of
$287 million. Chevron wants to sell the operations because
they are only "marginally profitable" and growth is likely to
be "low to zero," spokesmen said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chevron hasn't disclosed any other charges or profit
estimates for the quarter. The $220 million charge is equal
to about 62 cents a share, based on the company's 353 million
shares outstanding at Sept. 30.
   In the year-earlier fourth quarter, the company had a $1.2
billion charge, resulting in a net loss of $883 million, or
$2.58 a share. The largest part of the charge was a
write-down of producing and nonproducing oil and gas
properties.
   Analysts said they were mildly surprised by the size of
the anticipated charge for the fertilizer operations,
especially in view of their revenue. "It isn't an
insignificant number, but overall it's another positive step
in the company's restructuring effort," said Eugene Nowak, an
oil analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Several analysts said they don't expect any other large
unusual items in the quarter. Analysts' estimates for
fourth-quarter operating profits cover a huge range from as
little as $1 a share to about $2.55 a share, mainly because
of recent large swings in crude oil prices.
   Chevron shares rose $1 to $72 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   Chevron's fertilizer operations include a phosphate mine
near Vernal, Utah, connected by a 90-mile pipeline to a plant
in Rock Springs, Wyo., that opened in 1986. The company also
owns three nitrogen fertilizer plants and a half interest in
a fourth plant. The division employs about 600 people.

   Focus on Business Basics Spells Success for Invacare

   Wheelchair Concern Catered to
   Dealers and Its Sales Have Soared

   Eleven years ago, Invacare Corp. made and sold
clunky-looking wheelchairs -- much as it did back in 1885.
   The Elyria, Ohio, concern didn't have a business plan or
any new products on its drawing boards, and rival Everest &amp;
Jennings International Ltd. dominated the market. "Invacare
was a real pig's ear," declares Dan Moore, a Cleveland
entrepreneur who looked at its books.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But a new owner discovered how to save dealers time and
money, and in little more than a decade increased Invacare's
sales from about $19 million to an estimated $225 million
this year. What's more, Invacare's wheelchairs now outsell
Everest &amp; Jennings, and the former leader is mired in red ink
after launching a price war in an unsuccessful attempt to win
back market share.
   The health-care industry is known for its breakthrough
products and lavish research spending, but Invacare favored a
more basic approach. It broadened its offering of home
health-care products, found out what its customers' needs
were and made sure they were met. Its success illustrates how
painstaking attention to simple marketing and distribution
can revitalize a company sputtering along on stale, almost
forgotten products.
   A. Malachi Mixon III, who assembled a group that purchased
the company in 1979 and took it public in 1984, says he
"recognized that there was a heck of an opportunity with a
sleepy company in a relatively sleepy industry." Mr. Mixon,
now 49 years old, remains its chairman, chief executive and
president.
   The company hopes to further capitalize on the general
aging of the population and the trend toward administering
more health care at home.
   In 1979, however, Invacare had been for sale for two years
when Mr. Mixon led the group that purchased it for $7.8
million from health-care giant Johnson &amp; Johnson. Mr. Mixon
had no experience running a company; he had marketed
diagnostic scanners at J&amp;J's Technicare unit in Cleveland.
   Mr. Mixon, a Harvard-educated Vietnam veteran, says he
believed that if he could increase Invacare's annual sales,
"everything else would fall into place."
   He ousted 17 of the company's 20 salespeople and began
paying the replacements double the industry's going rate in
an effort to stimulate sales. Then he gambled, raising prices
5%. Within a year, those combined moves helped boost annual
revenue by $6 million -- enough to generate a profit after
hefty interest payments.
   But Mr. Mixon felt Invacare would have to move much closer
to its customers if it wanted to expand on a grand scale. At
the time, Invacare's competitors were selling large volumes
at reduced prices. The snag for dealers, however, was that
they often had to wait three weeks for deliveries. For many
of them, that meant a lot of cash tied up in excess
inventory.
   So Invacare countered by opening warehouses in larger
cities closer to dealers, many of which are cash-strapped
mom-and-pop operations. The dealers now get daily deliveries,
saving them money.
   Invacare also offers incentives such as free freight
charges that competitors are reluctant to match.
   From a single warehouse in 1979, Invacare now has 32
scattered across the U.S., and is using them not only for its
own products but to distribute health-care goods made by
other companies. That outside business adds $12 million to
annual revenue.
   It also has branched out from wheelchairs. It now makes
hospital beds, respiratory devices, rehabilitation equipment
and other patient aids. By selling a long list of products,
ranging from mattresses to scooter batteries, for other
companies, Invacare can offer wider variety than its
competitors and reduce ordering and handling costs.
   "Instead of going to 30 different manufacturers, the
dealers are coming to Invacare," says Vivian Wohl, an analyst
at Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co., San Francisco. Ms. Wohl, who
has been recommending the stock since earlier this year, says
the warehouse concept gives the company a pricing advantage
over competitors. Invacare common closed at $19.75 a share in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday, near its 52-week
high.
   Warren Nelson, chief financial officer at rival Everest &amp;
Jennings, Los Angeles, says the people at Invacare "are very
tough players. All we're trying to do is work out our own
problems. I still believe we make the best product, but I do
like their stock price better than ours." In composite
trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday, Everest &amp;
Jennings class B shares closed at $1.50, up 25 cents.
   It's not that Invacare hasn't had setbacks along the way.
In 1984, it was hurt by manufacturing problems, and the next
year it spent about $1 million replacing respiratory devices
that didn't work properly. Mr. Mixon says the company learned
from its mistakes. Now, he says, Invacare makes one of the
most reliable breathing devices, and has sharply lowered the
cost of producing its wheelchairs and hospital beds.
   Mr. Mixon says technology has broadened the market by
making wheelchairs easier to manuever. And Invacare, seeking
to build on its lead, has brought out 53 new products this
year, more than the combined total of the two previous years.
   It also is dabbling in mass advertising, a rarity among
companies in its field. The first ad, in USA Today, featured
a motorized three-wheeled scooter and targeted older people
who might have trouble getting around on foot, yet balk at
the idea of sitting in a wheelchair.
   One recent introduction is Invacare's sporty wheelchair
line aimed at what Mr. Mixon believes is a potential $50
million market. He says the chairs, made from lighter
materials and featuring colors like "red hot" and "jungle
lime," should appeal to active people who play basketball or
tennis or compete in road races. Some look more like chariots
than wheelchairs. "We have these wild and crazy colors," says
Mr. Mixon, "just like when you buy a car or tennis shoes."

   From Dec. 4 remarks to the Australian Parliament by Prime
Minister Bob Hawke defending Australia's decision to send
ships to join the international fleet in the Persian Gulf:

   I know there will be some who will ask why we should
contribute in the Gulf when others do not. The essential
answer is this -- that what others do or don't do does not
obviate our responsibility to judge for ourselves what is
right, and what is in our interests, and to act accordingly.
We also need to recognize that not only should we contribute,
but unlike many others, we can contribute -- we have a
relevant capability to contribute.
   I know there will be some who will cavil at the leading
role being played in the Gulf by the United States. They will
suspect that other nations who participate will only be
serving American interests. That view is profoundly mistaken.
   The U.S. is certainly playing a leading role, as we would
expect from a nation as wealthy and powerful as the U.S.
Indeed, we would be disappointed if the U.S. did not. . . .
But the U.S. role has been clearly at one in this case with
the wider interests of the international community, as
demonstrated by the support for Resolution 678 in the
Security Council.
   There are even those who have purported to base their
assessment of the Gulf situation on the presumption of moral
equivalence between the U.S. and Iraqi positions. . . . Let
there be no ambiguity here -- no "mindless muddying" of the
waters. If it comes to conflict, the international community
will not be the aggressor. The United States and the other
allies will not be the aggressor. The aggressor is the nation
that took, occupied and annexed Kuwait in August.

   Prudential-Bache Projects $250 Million '90 Loss

   NEW YORK -- Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said it will
post a larger-than-expected loss of $250 million for 1990,
which would be one of the worst earnings performances on
record for a U.S. brokerage firm.
   To bolster the sagging firm, Prudential-Bache's parent,
Prudential Insurance Co. of America, said it is adding more
than $200 million in new capital to the brokerage firm. That
comes on top of the $1 billion the big insurer has already
poured in since acquiring Prudential-Bache in 1981 in a
failed attempt to create a "financial supermarket" offering a
wide range of financial services and advice.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The projected $250 million loss would be
Prudential-Bache's third in the past four years. On Wall
Street, it raised new questions of how long George L. Ball,
Prudential-Bache's chairman since 1982, will remain in his
job. So far, the parent firm has given Mr. Ball its full
support despite the brokerage firm's continued losses.
   Prudential Insurance's infusion, amid one of Wall Street's
worst slumps, is the latest instance in which a deep-pocketed
parent has had to shore up a struggling Wall Street
securities firm. CS First Boston Inc., Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. and Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. this year all have
needed cash infusions of hundreds of millions of dollars
apiece.
   At the same time, Prudential Insurance took yet another
step to shrink Prudential-Bache and get it out of its riskier
businesses. Yesterday, the Newark, N.J., insurance company
said it is taking over about $600 million of
Prudential-Bache's leveraged buy-out investments and other
merchant-banking assets, as well as its interest-rate and
currency-swap portfolios.
   That will add two more businesses to the lines that
Prudential-Bache has left this year, including closing down
its takeover-stock speculation department and selling its
Canadian brokerage unit. It has also severely shrunk its
investment banking and limited-partnership departments. In
November, Prudential-Bache laid off at least two-thirds of
its investment bankers.
   Prudential-Bache asserted yesterday that it will be
profitable in a smaller form, now that it has taken steps to
pare itself down and given up aspirations of being a major
investment bank.
   "We have taken very strong steps, very major steps, very
wrenching steps to try to put ourselves in a place that
recognizes the future," Mr. Ball said in an interview. "It's
never fun to do that. For better or worse we've decided Wall
Street is a different street than it used to be, and that
we'd do whatever necessary to configure the firm for tomorrow
rather than yesterday."
   Prudential-Bache said its remaining core businesses,
brokerage for individual investors and money management, are
still profitable and are "expected to produce a very adequate
return on equity in 1991." The projected $250 million loss
reflects $370 million in costs of the major retrenchment
plan, the firm said. Among major brokerage firms, the
Prudential-Bache loss is likely to be exceeded only by the
projected 1990 loss of $800 million to $900 million at
Shearson, a unit of American Express Co. That loss reflects
Shearson's big retrenchment efforts. The Prudential-Bache
results are comparable to those last year at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., the nation's biggest brokerage firm, which posted a
$213.4 million loss reflecting its own retrenchment efforts.
   Prudential-Bache, while never a power in investment
banking, has the nation's fourth-biggest army of brokers,
with about 6,500. The brokerage firm had 19,000 employees a
year ago, but now is down to about 17,500. More than 1,200
employees were trimmed through the sale of its Canadian
operation, and another 300 or so through the pullback from
limited partnerships, takeover stocks and investment banking.
   Like many Wall Street firms, Prudential-Bache has suffered
from the slowdown in trading by individual investors and
others that began with the 1987 stock-market crash. Despite
that slowdown, the firm expanded its brokerage business by
buying the brokerage network of Thomson McKinnon Securities
Inc. last year. That acquisition contributed to
Prudential-Bache's 1989 loss of $51 million.
   Some analysts predict that Prudential-Bache will
eventually be sold or merged with another firm. This week,
Prudential-Bache confirmed that it was talking with Shearson
about combining the two firms' back-office, or
trade-processing, operations. But the firms denied the talks
would lead to any type of full-scale merger.
   Prudential-Bache is "not a great firm" right now, said
Perrin Long, veteran Wall Street analyst at Lipper Analytical
Securities Corp. "They lost a hell of a lot in merchant
banking and risk arbitrage," or takeover speculation, he
said. But Mr. Long said Prudential-Bache appears to be
"taking the necessary steps" to make money if the brokerage
business rebounds.
   Even without the $200 million equity infusion,
Prudential-Bache's capital base would still be "well in
excess of regulatory requirements," Prudential Insurance said
in a statement. Mr. Ball, in a 12-page memo to employees,
said the infusion was made so that no one questions
Prudential-Bache's "continuing rock-solidness."
   While Prudential-Bache's 1990 results are a blow to
Prudential Insurance's image, some analysts say the unit's
troubles won't hurt the parent that much financially. The
unit's loss is "only about 3% of Prudential's capital" of
$7.9 billion, said William Cavanagh, a vice president at
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   Prudential Insurance's chairman, Robert C. Winters, said
Prudential-Bache's loss "will certainly have an impact" on
the insurer's results. But with success in several other of
the parent's business units, including record sales of
individual insurance, "we believe we will be posting better
results than most of our competitors," he said.
   Along with acquiring Prudential-Bache's merchant banking
portfolio, Prudential Insurance said that "in the future,
merchant banking activity will be closely coordinated with
the parent."
   Mr. Cavanagh of S&amp;P said an important benefit is that "the
risk profile at Pru-Bache is less" because of the businesses
it has jettisoned. "When you look at the risk of the business
going forward, Prudential-Bache will have less risk and thus
the need for less net capital really," Mr. Cavanagh said.

   Economy:
   Businesses, Seeing Recession Deepening,
   Scale Back '91 Capital Spending Plans

   WASHINGTON -- Amid signs of a deepening recession,
businesses are scaling back their capital investment plans,
the Commerce Department reported.
   In the government's first survey of capital spending plans
for next year, businesses told the department that they
planned to increase their spending for new plant and
equipment a cautious 2.4% in 1991 over 1990.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to the survey taken in October and November,
businesses expected to increase capital spending 5.2% in 1990
over 1989. That estimate has headed steadily downward this
year along with the outlook for the economy, according to the
quarterly surveys.
   In the January-to-March survey, capital spending in 1990
was expected to increase 8.1%. In the second quarter,
businesses told the department they expected a 6.8% increase
in investment. By the third quarter, a 5.4% gain was
predicted.
   The 5.2% increase now expected would put plant and
equipment spending for the year at $533.91 billion. In 1989,
spending rose 11.4%, following an 11% jump in 1988.
   After adjustment for inflation, the spending figures
evince even less confidence on the part of businesses: The
increase in 1990 would be 4.1% and the increase in 1991 would
be a tiny 0.4%.
   "These are all slumpy, recessionary numbers," said
Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. in
New York.
   In fact, some economists said actual spending in 1990 and
plans for 1991 may well come down from the October and
November survey estimates. A spate of economic reports in
recent weeks have suggested that the economy took a serious
tumble in the fourth quarter. Manufacturing slowdowns have
pushed up unemployment, the trade deficit has worsened and
consumer spending has risen only slightly.
   The October-to-November survey is "still an optimistic
reading," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co. He
said the downturn in the economy has been so sharp in the
fourth quarter that inflation-adjusted capital spending plans
for 1991 likely would turn down in the next quarterly survey.
   The 2.4% increase anticipated next year would be the
smallest capital investment increase since a 2.6% decline in
1986.
   Manufacturers, in particular, were planning to restrict
their capital spending sharply from previous years. They said
they planned a 0.7% increase in 1991, following an expected
4.6% increase this year and gains of 12.5% in 1989 and 15.9%
in 1988. Within the manufacturing category, makers of durable
goods -- more expensive items intended to last at least three
years -- expected to decrease spending 0.8% next year after
an increase this year of 1.4%. Nondurable goods makers were
planning a 1.8% increase next year, following a 7.3% rise
this year.
   Nonmanufacturing businesses said they expected to boost
spending 3.4% next year, compared with an expected 5.6%
increase in 1990 and increases of 10.8% in 1989 and 8.4% in
1988.
   The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.

   HONG KONG -- Sir Run Run Shaw views his plan to buy a
stake in the R.H. Macy &amp; Co. as only an investment, and he
doesn't intend to participate in running the closely held New
York retailer, a spokesman for the movie investor said.
   He is mulling, however, "other forms of participation,"
such as board representation, said the spokesman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The spokesman acknowledged Macy's problems, including
relatively heavy debt, but he said Sir Run Run regards these
as short-term difficulties. "The company is well-managed.
It's got fine franchises," he said. "We're confident in its
longer-term prospects."
   Macy said this week that it had attracted as much as
US$187.6 million in new equity capital to be used to buy back
some of its depressed high-yield junk bonds. Sir Run Run has
agreed to buy $25 million of Macy's Series III preferred
stock, with an option to invest $25 million more by March 31.
He would become Macy's fourth-largest shareholder if the
option is executed.
   Macy also said that its nonmanagement investors have
agreed to purchase $119 million of Series III preferred stock
and that it has sold $18.6 million of Series II preferred
stock to several shopping-center developers.
   Sir Run Run, 83 years old, is among Hong Kong's wealthiest
individuals. His fortune is founded on the entertainment
business, but he also invests heavily in real estate. Macy is
his first major investment in the retail business.
   The Macy stake, like much of his wealth, is held
privately. His principal listed vehicle, Shaw Brothers (Hong
Kong) Ltd., owns movie theaters, produces movies and licenses
film releases. His about 67% stake in the company, at current
market prices, is valued at about HK$1 billion, or US$128.2
million).
   Through Shaw Brothers, Sir Run Run also controls
Television Broadcasts Ltd., which dominates Hong Kong's
television-broadcasting industry.
   The spokesman says Sir Run Run has no plans to boost his
Macy stake beyond what has been provided for in the option.

   Disney's Star Is Foreign to U.S. Audiences

   HOLLYWOOD -- What Pele was to soccer, Gerard Depardieu is
to movies. In much of the world, particularly in Western
Europe, he is acclaimed as the greatest living screen actor,
a French Brando, a legend.
   But in the U.S., people ask "Who?"
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, as Walt Disney Co. film executives found when
testing brief TV ads with audiences, many Americans' initial
impression of the shaggy, beefy, big-nosed actor was that he
was a "fat slob."
   The female lead in the coming film "Green Card" has the
same reaction, but after a while she falls madly in love.
Disney's vaunted marketing machine must ensure that audiences
do the same.
   But first, they have to get people to show up. The main
thing people ask when they hear that a film is a love story
is "Who's in it?" But the movie's co-star, Andie MacDowell of
"sex, lies, and videotape," is also relatively unknown.
   The subject matter of this small-scale romantic comedy
won't help sell it either, even if the idea is easy to sum up
on a poster: "The story of two people who got married, met,
and then fell in love." Hollywood generally loves concepts
that can be explained in a sentence: Two strangers, a scruffy
Frenchman and a slightly priggish American horticulturist,
get married, he to gain residency status, she to get an
apartment she covets. But however packageable the idea seems,
it doesn't hold any special allure.
   "It's outside most people's experience," concedes Peter
Weir, who wrote, produced and directed "Green Card."
   The marketing difficulties are especially frustrating
because Disney executives are proud of the film. Disney
Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg has taken it as a
personal challenge to successfully open the movie, which some
Disney wags are calling "`Pretty Woman' for people who
think." The poster for "Green Card" bears more than a passing
resemblance to the one used for "Pretty Woman," Disney's
biggest hit ever.
   Christmas is a crowded, competitive time, especially for
fragile movies, but "Green Card" is being released Sunday to
qualify it for Academy Award consideration. Most reviews
aren't out yet, but they're likely to be generally favorable.
Rolling Stone called it "captivating" but with "all the heft
of a potato chip." Mr. Weir, the Australian director who made
"The Year of Living Dangerously" and "Witness," is highly
regarded. Disney gets prestige points no matter what, but a
success would help redeem a winter season when Disney's
"Three Men and a Little Lady" and "Rescuers Down Under" were
snowed under by Fox's "Home Alone."
   It would surpass Disney executives' wildest dreams if the
film won the kind of audience attracted by other urban fare
like "Moonstruck" and "When Harry Met Sally." But the
marketing of the film is a slow and arduous process; it's
definitely not just a matter of buying the right TV time. Mr.
Katzenberg has criss-crossed the country to be the host at
upscale screenings followed by receptions at New York's 21
Club, Hollywood's Morton's and the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art.
   This is an effort to reach "opinionmakers," says Disney
marketing chief Robert Levin. Through word-of-mouth, he hopes
the film will do well in New York and Los Angeles, then build
gradually as it goes to a still-selective 100 screens Jan 11.
If any kind of buzz continues and if other Christmas movies
wither, Disney hopes theater owners will make room for "Green
Card" on more and more screens.
   Disney is walking a tightrope. It needs Mr. Depardieu's
tiny art-house following to help launch the picture, but if
the film is perceived as too arty, it could turn off wider
segments of the audience.
   "When someone is confronted with a piece of material, they
can say, `I get it, but I think you have to be smart,'" says
Mr. Levin. "They're afraid that they're going to wind up in
the audience and not get the joke when everyone else does."
   So the TV spots and theatrical trailer rather mundanely
explain the idea and show a little romance and comedy. Mr.
Levin says the only reason the trailer even mentions that Mr.
Depardieu is "the most acclaimed actor in France" is so the
handful of people who know this will be reassured that Disney
is aware of it. "The rest of the people will say, `Big
deal.'"
   Disney hasn't been too proud to try some Hollywood
gimmicks, but they, too, have been problematic. The marketing
people placed classified ads seeking couples who got married
so one partner could get a green card to stay in the U.S.,
thinking they would be fodder for talk shows that would also
mention the film. "But it appears only to have generated the
interest of the INS," says Mr. Levin. As in the film, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service doesn't care if the
couple are in love and want to live happily ever after; the
initial act is still fraud.
   Mr. Weir thought up the movie's premise three years ago
after returning to Australia to take a year off, licking his
wounds from the disappointing opening of "The Mosquito
Coast." He wound up writing the script with Mr. Depardieu in
mind, even though he had never met him and didn't know
whether Mr. Depardieu could speak English. (He can, sort of.)
   Disney has an aggressively hands-on attitude about its
films and generally steers clear of renowned directors for
this reason, but Mr. Weir and Mr. Katzenberg, who did "Dead
Poets Society" together, get along well. Although Mr. Weir
says Disney shows "excessive zeal" about enforcing budgetary
constraints and can be "bureaucratic," he was left alone on
"Green Card" because the $12 million film was independently
produced. Mr. Depardieu and Mr. Weir accepted reduced fees to
meet the budget, nothing new for the French actor who once
starred in a movie for a struggling director in return for a
bottle of wine. (He did stipulate that it be a very good
bottle.)
   Disney executives seemed resigned to allowing Mr. Weir to
make the film his way. They couldn't get him to cast a bigger
name than Ms. MacDowell or to broaden the comedy elements.
They didn't push too hard about Mr. Weir's refusal to give
the film a "Pretty Woman" fairy-tale ending. They would just
say, "Don't you realize that if you recut this, you could buy
a new house?" Mr. Weir recalls.
   But now Mr. Weir needs Disney to get people into theaters,
and the director sees some irony in this. The movie industry,
he says, "has trained audiences to respond to a siren song:
`Come and get it, you'll like it,' and it's turned into a
Frankenstein monster. They release all these dumb movies, and
then when they have one they like -- one everybody likes,
that's simple and honest -- it turns out to be difficult to
sell."

   Mutual Funds:
   Does Wave of Muni Mania
   Mean Now Is Time to Sell?

BOND MARKET NEWS (BON)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Mutual fund investors, shrugging off the
recent spate of bad news about state and city budgets, are
throwing money at municipal bond funds at a feverish pace.
   Investors are eager to minimize taxes and they "sense that
this is the last game in town," says Dale Rabiner, manager of
the $160 million Bartlett Fixed Income Fund, a no-load mutual
fund based in Cincinnati.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mutual fund investors are notoriously bad at guessing
market swings. So the municipal-bond buying binge is
prompting some nervousness. "Time and time again, contrarian
thinking pays off," Mr. Rabiner notes.
   Single-state municipal bond funds were the best-selling
category of mutual funds in 1989. And they are on track for
another chart-topping year.
   According to the Investment Company Institute, the trade
group for the mutual fund industry, $5.3 billion flooded into
single-state funds in the first 10 months of this year. That
inflow outstripped any other mutual fund category except
money market funds. General municipal bond funds also did
well, pulling in $3.2 billion. These figures represent sales
minus redemptions, plus the net effect of switches involving
other funds in the same family; reinvested dividends are
excluded.
   Some fund managers believe the current muni mania is
entirely justified. "The municipals haven't rallied as much
as Treasurys," Ian MacKinnon, Vanguard Group's head of fixed
income, says. "Clearly, munis are at the cheap end of their
trading range, compared to Treasurys. We think it's a smart
idea to buy munis right now."
   But if fund investors' current enthusiasm for municipal
bonds does foretell a coming decline, it wouldn't be the
first time.
   Fund investors bought stock funds heavily prior to both
the 1987 and 1990 bear markets. They also poured money into
U.S. government and tax-free bond funds right up until the
April 1987 bond market slump. In 1988, high-yield "junk" bond
funds pulled in more money than any other mutual fund
category. The following year, the junk bond market started
unraveling.
   Why are fund investors such poor market-timers? Mr.
Rabiner says that when it comes to bonds, the problem arises
because many fund investors buy based on yield. What they
should really look at, he says, is total return, which
includes both the share-price change and the yield. This is
because prices for older bonds will slump whenever yields are
rising.
   Lately, few investments have matched the yield offered by
municipal bond funds. According to Lipper Analytical
Services, general municipal bond funds have yielded 6.7% over
the past 12 months. Figure in a top 33% tax rate, and this
yield is worth 10% on a pretax basis. Among the major fund
categories tracked by Lipper, only two groups have offered a
higher yield, junk bond funds and short-term world income
funds.
   So far, municipal bond investors have done pretty well.
Over the past 12 months, there hasn't been too much disparity
between the yields on municipal funds and the total return.
   "Compared to stocks, owning municipals has been
brilliant," Guy Wickwire, manager of Fidelity High Yield
Tax-Free Portfolio, says. "There have been isolated, small
defaults over the last few years, and if the economy
continues to be bad, we will probably have more. But I don't
think the defaults will pick up any."
   Bartlett's Mr. Rabiner, however, reckons problems may lie
ahead. He notes that many state and local governments are
struggling with budget deficits, and yet the yield spread
between the highest-rated and lowest-rated municipal bonds is
still relatively narrow.
   Mr. Rabiner says investors should make sure it really
makes sense for them to be in a municipal bond fund, given
their income levels. He suggests fund investors might want to
switch out of high-yield municipal bond funds and
state-specific funds and into a high-quality general
municipal bond fund. Even people in high-quality funds should
be prepared to sit tight in the face of short-term losses
caused as credit problems hurt the price of all municipal
bonds, he believes.
   But others see little reason to worry. "I think it's a
myth that fund investors are generally wrong," Avi Nachmany,
a fund analyst with Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co., says. He points
out that the recent returns of municipal bonds haven't been
lavish enough to prompt speculative buying. Mr. Nachmany
reckons that investors have been buying municipal bond funds
simply to shelter income.

   For First Investors Consolidated Corp., the bad news keeps
on coming.
   The New York-based mutual fund company, which is already
battling charges of sales abuse brought against it by New
York and Massachusetts, has just lost its top fund manager.
Daniel Duane, who used to run the top-performing First
Investors Global Fund, has left to run three funds managed by
Prudential Equity Management Associates, a subsidiary of
Prudential Insurance Co. of America, Newark, N.J.
   "We don't like to lose anybody," says David Grayson, First
Investors president. "But we do have his {Mr. Duane's}
righthand person, who worked with him, taking over the fund."

   In his thoughtful review of Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson's
book "Final Analysis," Lee Lescaze briefly refers to Mr.
Masson's libel suit against the New Yorker, Alfred Knopf Inc.
and me, arising from the publication of my book "In the Freud
Archives" (Leisure &amp; Arts, Oct. 30). Mr. Lescaze writes, "He
has sued for libel, charging that Ms. Malcolm put words in
his mouth that made him appear egotistical, irresponsible,
and sexually promiscuous. Ms. Malcolm conceded she altered
some of Mr. Masson's quotes, but insisted the changes were
minor." In fact, I have never "conceded" any such thing or
"insisted" on anything of the sort. On the contrary, I have
steadfastly maintained that I quoted Mr. Masson accurately.
Nowhere in the mountain of documents that has formed during
the six years of the lawsuit can any such "concession" be
found.
   However, I cannot blame Mr. Lescaze for such a mistake. A
smaller but, in its way, more impassable mountain of
documents has accreted side by side with the legal one: the
press commentary about the lawsuit. In the writings forming
this mountain, the facts of the case have gotten so balled up
that even lawyers are beginning to lose their bearings and
are writing about the case with incomprehension. I believe
the confusion has arisen largely out of the fact that the
case never came to trial, but was disposed of under the rules
of a little-understood and rather arcane procedure known as
"summary judgment." (To date, two courts have dismissed the
suit; an appeal of the dismissal is pending before the
Supreme Court.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This procedure (if I may quote from a stab at describing
it that I made in an afterword to my book "The Journalist and
the Murderer") is "an expedient the law provides for
defendants who wish to avoid the expense of a trial. In
summary judgment, the defendant must demonstrate that the
plaintiff could not possibly win his case at trial. To make
this demonstration fit within the confines of Rule 56(c) of
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure -- which stipulates that
summary judgment may be granted only when `there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact' -- the defendant is
often obliged to leave unchallenged dire accusations which,
at trial, the plaintiff would have to back up with evidence."
   To comply with Rule 56(c) in the Masson-Malcolm suit, the
court could not consider four pages of notes that I had
submitted as the source of certain quotations in my book,
because Mr. Masson contended they were "fabrications" --
i.e., had made them an "issue as to material fact." It was
the "as if" rules of the exercise that constrained it from
considering these notes, which show that Mr. Masson had
actually uttered words he denied uttering, as in one
frequently cited example, when he said that if he had moved
into Anna Freud's house after her death, "Maresfield Gardens
would have been a center of scholarship, but it also would
have been a place of sex, women, fun." (The quotation, which
appears on page 33 of my book, also appears almost word for
word in the contested notes.) Instead, it considered
corroborating quotations from 40 hours of taped interviews
(which Mr. Masson was obliged to accept as genuine) --
quotations in which, time and time again, over many months of
interviews, he returns to the same subject: "We were going to
pass women on to each other, and we were going to have a
great time together when I lived in the Freud house," and
"They're going to be calling the police on me every time I
give a party or something," and "It would take an Act of
Congress to get me out of Anna Freud's house." The court,
required by Rule 56(c) to pretend that the notes did not
exist, then ruled that even if the quotations in the book
were altered versions of statements in the tapes, the suit
could not prevail.
   Unfortunately, however, the "even if" formula of summary
judgment was taken by the press to mean "it is so." It is now
widely believed that I altered "We would pass women on to
each other . . ." to read "It also would have been a place of
sex, women, fun . . ." In fact, I made no such alteration.
What, in heaven's name, would have been my reason for doing
so? But, as I said earlier, summary judgment is devilishly
hard to grasp.

   Acquisition of PS
   Of New Hampshire
   Is Cleared by SEC

   WASHINGTON -- Public Service Co. of New Hampshire cleared
a major regulatory hurdle in its plan to be acquired by
Northeast Utilities and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection.
   The embattled utility's plan was unanimously approved by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has partial
control over the accord because Northeast is a holding
company for utilities and must register with the agency.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The transaction, which required nine federal and state
regulatory clearances, also received the conditional blessing
yesterday of an administrative law judge at the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission. The acquisition now requires
the energy commission's approval.
   The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manchester, N.H., has
approved the accord, but that decision is being appealed. The
Nuclear Regulatory Commission also needs to allow the
transfer of the license for the Seabrook Nuclear Power
Project to Northeast, Hartford, Conn. Still standing in the
way of the deal is the final permission of several states,
including New Hampshire, a state in which a rate increase
recently was approved and is being appealed.
   Despite those remaining hurdles, yesterday's actions are a
boost for PS New Hampshire, which filed for bankruptcy-court
protection in January 1988 after drowning in debt related to
its 35.6% holding in the controversial Seabrook plant.
Northeast then proposed to buy the Manchester utility for
$2.3 billion, setting the regulatory steps in motion.
   In examining the proposed acquisition, the SEC staff
looked at the financing of the accord, the schedule of rate
increases, the proposed savings to the utilities of combining
their overhead, and how the move would change the
concentration of electric-power generation in New England.
The commission followed the staff recommendation to approve
the deal.
   In doing so, the agency rejected a proposal by several
intervenors to hold a hearing on the plan at the SEC, said
William Weeden, the SEC official most closely involved in the
proposal. He said their objections centered on whether the
acquisition by Northeast would create a near monopoly for
electric power in the region.
   Separately, the SEC voted to put out for public comment a
proposal designed to help overseas underwriters make
offerings in the U.S. The plan, already in place for U.S.
underwriters, would allow the overseas underwriting firm
making an offering in the U.S. to support the stock price.
   "The commission has always recognized that as a form of
manipulation, but a form of manipulation that is needed,"
said Larry Bergmann, the agency's associate director for
market regulation. He said that the SEC has been giving
exemptions for these "stabilizations" to foreign underwriters
but that the agency is looking to "codify" those exemptions.

   GLOOMIER OECD PREDICTIONS

<TEXT>
   Worse-than-expected U.S. economic data have caused the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to
revise downward already gloomy predictions about the world
economy.
   Scrapping forecasts compiled just a month ago, the OECD
now says the U.S. economy probably didn't grow at all in the
second half of this year, and the total output of growth and
services may decline during the first half of next year.
Previous projections were for 0.6% growth in each of those
periods.
   The only good news in the 24-nation organization's
prognosis is that the stagnant U.S. economy won't drag down
other industrial economies as much as in past recessions. "We
don't see an OECD-wide recession coming," said Stephen
Potter, an OECD economist. Continued growth in Germany and
Japan is the main factor keeping the broader group of nations
from sinking further economically.
   Factoring in the worsening outlook in the U.S., OECD chief
economist David Henderson estimated that growth in 1990 for
the 24 nations would come to 2.7%.
                                                                                                       

   AUSTRALIA VS. INSIDER TRADING
                                                                                                       

   Penalties for insider trading in Australia will be
increased sharply under draft legislation made public
yesterday. Attorney General Michael Duffy said the
legislation would see the maximum penalty for individuals
convicted of insider trading lifted to 200,000 Australian
dollars (US$154,340) from A$20,000 currently. The maximum
penalty for corporations would increase to A$1 million from
A$50,000 currently. Mr. Duffy said the higher penalties
"signaled in no uncertain terms . . . that insider trading
won't be tolerated."
                                                                                                       

   PRIVATIZING PORTUGAL'S PRESS
                                                                                                       

   Portugal announced plans to complete its privatization of
the press, with the sale of the prestigious daily newspaper
Diario de Noticias. The sale of two million of the paper's
shares is expected to bring the state about 10 billion
escudos ($75 million). The real-estate value of the paper's
offices in downtown Lisbon accounts for almost half the
price.
                                                                                                       

   ISRAEL-CHINA TIES
                                                                                                       

   Israel may send three diplomats to Beijing to upgrade the
status of an academicliaison office in the Chinese capital.
The three would be the first Israeli diplomats sent to China,
the Jerusalem Post reported. The Foreign Ministry declined
comment on the report. But a government source said the
dispatch of diplomats to China was "a major possibility" that
required only final approval.
                                                                                                       

   GROWING THREAT TO WORLD HEALTH
                                                                                                       

   An estimated 250 million or more sexually transmitted
infections -- including syphilis, genital herpes, gonorrhea
and the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV -- occur
annually around the world, and the number is increasing,
according to the World Health Organization. "Sexually
transmitted infections are not under control, either in the
developed or developing world," said Andre Meheus, chief
medical officer of the WHO Program of Sexually Transmitted
Diseases. WHO said, "Prevention of sexually transmitted
diseases and infections is rendered difficult by a variety of
factors, including the relative ease of transmission, the
difficulties of changing sexual behavior {and} the lack of
vaccines or, in some cases, curative treatments."
                                                                                                       

   REPEAL OF APARTHEID LAWS?
                                                                                                       

   A leading South African newspaper reported that the South
African government would announce plans to repeal major
apartheid laws when Parliament opens Feb. 1. Business Day
said President F.W. de Klerk is expected to call for the
scrapping of the Group Areas Act, which segregates
neighborhoods by race, and the Land Acts, which reserve 87%
of the country's land for the white minority.
                                                                                                       

   LARGEST OVERSEAS INVESTOR
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN became the world's largest investor in overseas
industry and property in 1989, surpassing Britain, the Japan
External Trade Organization said in its annual report on
direct investment.
   The U.S. remained the largest recipient of
direct-investment funds in the year. But the report shows
increasing flows of funds to Europe, and large cross-border
investment within both that region and Southeast Asia.
   A total of $197.878 billion was spent in direct investment
in 1989, an increase of 21.5% from the previous year, the
organization said. It estimated that the total amount of
outstanding cross-border investment was $1.263 trillion at
the end of the year. Direct investment includes investment in
companies, factories and property, but not securities
purchases or similar purely financial transactions.
   Japan invested $44.13 billion overseas in 1989, up 29%
from the previous year, the organization said, bringing its
total direct investment overseas to $154.4 billion. Behind
Japan were Britain, in 1988 the largest investing country,
with $31.753 billion, down 13.8%, for a total of 191.9
billion; and the U.S., with $31.722 billion, up 80.9%, for a
total of 373.4 billion.

   In London, Christie's auctioned the Jewish marriage
certificate of Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller for $13,700.
. . . Twenty-eight art masterpieces seized from French
citizens by the Nazis have been found in a cupboard at a
Berlin museum, the French magazine L'Express reported. The
trove is said to include works by Monet, Renoir and Gauguin.

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. plan to
keep four more car and truck assembly plants idle after the
traditional holiday closings end Jan. 2, meaning that a total
of 10 U.S. assembly plants won't be working during the first
weeks of 1991.
   GM said it will idle until Jan. 14 the Detroit assembly
plant that builds recreational and special vehicle chassis
and the Flint, Mich., plant that builds Chevrolet Blazer and
GMC Jimmy sport-utility vehicles, Chevrolet and GMC Suburban
truckwagons, and crew-cab chassis. A total of 4,870 workers
will be laid off because of slow sales.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler will temporarily halt production at two more
plants and extend the shutdown of a third to cut backlogs of
unsold vehicles. About 1,600 workers will be laid off until
Jan. 21 at Chrysler's St. Louis No. 1 plant, which builds the
Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Daytona models. The Toledo, Ohio,
plant that makes Jeep Cherokee sport-utility vehicles will be
closed until the week of Jan. 28, affecting about 4,500
employees. And Chrysler said it will extend the planned
shutdown of its Sterling Heights, Mich., subcompact car plant
for one week, until Jan. 28.
   Chrysler also said it has scheduled two shifts of overtime
tomorrow at the Windsor assembly plant that builds the Dodge
Caravan and Plymouth Voyager minivans. The auto maker's St.
Louis No. 2 plant, which builds larger minivan models, will
work two nine-hour shifts daily.
   Overall, the 10 U.S. auto makers plan to build a total of
90,195 cars this week, down 28% from 125,242 in the
comparable 1989 week.

   SEOUL -- South Korean government officials find themselves
facing a credibility gap as they try to assure the U.S. that
Seoul isn't reverting to an anti-import trade policy.
   Korean trade officials in Seoul and Washington complain
that U.S. officials no longer believe them. U.S. officials
say their perception is correct. Ambassador Donald Gregg said
in a recent speech here to the Korean Council on Foreign
Relations: "Unfortunately, I cannot stand here today and tell
you truthfully that all is well with the relationship. It is
not."

   The result is that South Korea, which two years ago was
considered the most cooperative nation in correcting trade
wrongs, is now far down the list, way below Japan.
   "That is the funny thing when confidence erodes," says
Sandra J. Kristoff, assistant U.S. trade representative in
charge of Korea. "It takes a long time, but when it is gone,
it is gone with a vengeance. It takes a long time to get it
back."
   The reason for the loss of confidence is an anti-import
campaign that the South Korean government supported, yet
continued to deny was occurring even after U.S. and European
executives in Seoul compiled massive evidence.
   Mars Co. recently had a major problem getting its holiday
candy off the docks in Pusan. The Koreans insisted it be
thoroughly inspected for sugar content. Marriott Corp. has
been asking for two years to set up an airline-food facility
near Seoul's international airport, but the permission has
been delayed even after domestic competitors have set up
their kitchens. The South Korean government is now
strong-arming fast-food makers into using domestic frozen
french fries instead of imported ones.
   To help with Korea's credibility problem, President Roh
Tae Wo sent Cho Soon, the former deputy prime minister, as a
special envoy to Washington.
   Mr. Cho tried to smooth ruffled feathers in Washington by
saying that there was no anti-import campaign, but rather "a
series of rather irritating incidents" and a
misunderstanding.
   "It has been so obvious and so intense, they can't buy out
of it by saying it is all a misunderstanding," replies one
State Department official. Ms. Kristoff calls the Korean
response disingenuous.
   Bridging the credibility gap is all the more difficult
because Korean newspapers are taking an increasingly
anti-foreign, and particularly anti-American, tone. A
presidential adviser says, "Newspapers are playing up the
anti-American feeling and it spreads very easily."
   Officials, who once denied that the government was behind
an anti-import campaign, now admit that the government did
want to moderate consumption and therefore targeted the
consumption of imports. Now, they cannot make a public
distinction between opposition to consumption and opposition
to imports.
   "Within the government there is a consensus now that the
anti-consumption campaign is different from an anti-import
campaign," says an official with the Ministry of Trade and
Industry. But like scores of government officials interviewed
for this article, he wouldn't let his name be used for fear
that the media would criticize him for "caving in" to the
U.S.
   When the American Chamber of Commerce complained in a
private meeting with government officials that the
anti-consumption campaign was being used by some bureaucrats
to restrict imports, the complaints were leaked by the
government to the Korean press. That set off a firestorm of
protest in the press. The respected Chosun Ilbo ran a
front-page story headlined, "Indiscriminate U.S. trade
pressure interferes in domestic affairs."
   Radical students and the main opposition party seized on
the issue. The Fraternity of Bereaved Families of Korean
Independence Fighters and Love-The-Motherland Movement
Council announced it would start a nationwide boycott of
U.S.-made goods in retaliation.
   In his tough speech, Ambassador Gregg spoke out against
the "emotionalism" in every sector of Korean life,
particularly the press.
   The reaction was predictable. One politician accused him
of treating Korea as if it were the 51st state. The newspaper
Kukmin Ilbo said the feelings expressed in the Ambassador's
speech, "were something like the feelings one experiences if
one's face is scratched by his sweetheart or if slapped by a
younger brother."

   In the review of the Gerard Depardieu film of "Cyrano de
Bergerac" (Leisure &amp; Arts, Nov. 29), Julie Salamon claims
that Edmond Rostand wrote the play in 1870. That would make
the author two years old at the time, as he was born in 1868.
The right date should have been given as 1897. Andre Gide, in
an entry in his journal about that time, wrote that some
people in France were comparing Rostand with Shakespeare,
adding the quip, "Every generation has the Shakespeare it
deserves." Perhaps Gide, who later recommended rejecting
Proust's great novel when he was a reader for a publishing
house, was too harsh in judging Rostand, who after all wrote
one of the few 19th-century plays still performed frequently
in France.
   Incidentally, in connection with the current French film
several newspaper articles have referred to the Jose Ferrer
English-language version without mentioning the earlier
French film with Claude Dauphin (which I saw in Montreal in
1949 and probably was not shown commercially in the U.S.).

   I hope those who prattle about proposed capital-gains tax
reductions being a "break for the rich" read your story about
John Kling and his wife ("Autumn Years," page one, Nov. 13)
and have some insight about what those levies really do. When
Mr. Kling had to surrender his Gulf stock, (the backbone of
his life savings) he saw capital-gains taxes chew away the
nest egg he was counting on for retirement.
   The upshot of making capital-gains taxes oppressive is to
penalize those frugal enough to make even a modest investment
or two during their lifetime. Not just the "rich." (And I'm
amazed at what some people call rich.) But considering the
credit-card-junkie mentality of this country, our illustrious
leaders included, I guess penalizing the prudent among us is
right in line with reality.

   Your article consisted primarily of anecdotes, including a
bleak portrayal of elderly people who might be considered
"poor." There was no mention of just how rare such people
are. The official poverty rate for the elderly is only 6%,
yet the rate is 20% for American children. Ours is the only
developed country in the world with such a generational
reversal.
   People over age 65 constitute the wealthiest social class
in the country, with more than $8 trillion in net worth, not
counting pensions and Social Security. Today's retirees who
receive Social Security have higher incomes than those paying
the tax. They're receiving two to seven times what they put
in. Medicare recipients are receiving five to 20 times the
actuarial value of prior contributions. Significant cuts are
prevented by the most powerful lobby in the country, the
American Association of Retired Persons.
   As this politically powerful and self-interested portion
of our population continues to swell, their benefits are paid
for by young workers who will never see the same benefits.

   As an Elderlaw practitioner, I am reminded constantly that
the difference between the (well-off) Brethauers and the
(downtrodden) Klings and Macons is, basically, luck -- the
former are apparently healthy, and the latter are not. We
don't have a national health-care system in this country, a
fact that doesn't really confront many people until
retirement, when their incomes are fixed and their bodies are
more likely to be deteriorating. When they come to see me
about a potential nursinghome placement they are astonished
to find out that they have lost in the draw if they have an
illness for which neither insurance nor Medicare will pay,
and they must exhaust their assets to receive assistance from
Medicaid, often leaving their spouses impoverished.
   When there is no national leadership in a problem area, no
rational planning is done, and whatever emerges is a result
of many political compromises and has almost nothing
whatsoever to do with what the real needs are.

   ST. LOUIS -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics
Corp. said they are notifying a total of 8,000 employees --
as early as Jan. 2 if the troubled A-12 Navy attack plane
program is canceled.
   The announcements came as the two aerospace concerns
negotiate with the Navy and aides to Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney to try to salvage the program, which has been plagued
by engineering snafus and cost overruns. The Pentagon
threatened to cancel the program, and earlier this week gave
the contractors until Jan. 2 to come up with a plan to solve
the problems.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yet despite the public threats, all parties appear to be
working toward a compromise that would probably slow
development of the A-12 and impose some kind of financial
penalty on the two companies for past mistakes, but still
keep the plane alive.
   McDonnell Douglas's McDonnell Aircraft Co. unit has about
6,000 employees in the program, mostly in St. Louis, and
General Dynamics has 4,000, mostly in Fort Worth, Texas. Both
companies said the employees being notified of the potential
layoffs won't be limited to those working on the A-12.

   Airline Shakeout: Who Will Benefit?

   The airline industry suddenly is in another buying frenzy.
   In recent weeks, a number of prize assets have been sold
or put on the block: United Airlines snapped up Pan Am's
London business; American acquired international operations
from Trans World Airlines and picked up Continental Airlines'
Seattle-Tokyo route authority; USAir acquired Midway
Airline's Philadelphia real estate; and Northwest got key
Pacific routes and a 25% stake of Hawaiian Airlines.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Many industry observers believe there is more to come. But
as the industry becomes increasingly divided between buyers
and sellers, more questions are being raised about whether
all this is a good thing.
   Will consumers suffer if the airline industry is
eventually dominated by three or four big carriers? Will
competition disappear if smaller carriers can't enter new
markets? Or will having a few strong carriers make the U.S.
industry more competitive on a global scale?
   The top executives of the nation's airlines are at odds on
those points. Here is a sampling of some of their comments
from interviews conducted this week:
                                                                                                       

   THOMAS PLASKETT
   Chairman, Pan Am Corp.
   Pan American World Airways
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Plaskett is one of the few voices among airline
executives questioning the shakeout: "I don't think you can
say consolidation is a good thing unless at the same time you
talk about the risk to competition and the possible
anti-competitive aspects of only having three airlines. I've
not yet reached the conclusion that the concentration is in
the best interest of the consumer."
   The sale of Midway's Philadelphia operations to USAir
Group "is clearly eliminating a low-cost, low-price
competitor," he says. USAir dominates in Philadelphia. This
week's proposed sale of 40 takeoff and landing slots by TWA
at Chicago's O'Hare airport reduces competition, he says. "In
the long run, prices will be higher."
   "The bottom line is that the price of entry for new
competitors will be out of reach. It will be impossibly high.
The architects of deregulation had this vision of all this
new competition which would keep fares and costs down. It
hasn't developed the way the architects originally
envisioned."
   He says: "Once you get the concentration of major
carriers, the days of new entry will be over."
                                                                                                       

                                                                                                       

   CARL ICAHN
   Chairman, Trans World Airlines
                                                                                                       

   "This industry is screwed up," says Mr. Icahn. "It's
terrible. The industry is in awful shape."
   Mr. Icahn blames competitors' airplane buying sprees of
the late 1980s for today's overcapacity. "I said there would
be a day of reckoning, and the day has come," he says.
"There's way too much capacity in the industry. It's just a
disease that was accelerated with the Kuwait" crisis.
   Mr. Icahn says it is wrong for troubled carriers to seek
government help through tax deferrals or release of the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. "It's not the function of the
government to save us," he says. "It's a free enterprise
system and we can't depend on running to our mothers if
things go bad."
                                                                                                       

   DAVE HINSON
   Chairman, Midway Airlines
                                                                                                       

   Midway is a child of deregulation, started in 1979. Today,
it is scaling back its operations and selling assets to
giants such as USAir and American in a struggle to survive.
"There is excess capacity. There's no capital. You have to
monetize your assets. The big carriers are financing the weak
carriers," says Midway's Mr. Hinson. "We did the things we
need to do to survive."
   The consolidation is a natural outcome of deregulation, he
says. "If you were going to run a computer model in 1978,
then this is a fairly predictable outcome. It's occurred in
every other industry," he says. "There is no practical
alternative to consolidation. It's either a free market or it
isn't." He doesn't consider government restraint the answer.
"The worst thing that could happen is any form of
re-regulation. It would be a disaster for the consumer, the
industry and the country."
                                                                                                       

   ED BEAUVAIS
   Chairman, America West Airlines
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Beauvais has no problem with natural market forces
pushing the shakeout in the airline industry. "The more
balanced the competitive atmosphere is, the better off
America West is." But given that his airline is one of the
few carriers started since deregulation that is still flying,
"there's something wrong. There's got to be something wrong."
The result, he says, is an oligopoly, and that hurts
consumers.
   "If we're part of an oligopoly, we're going to have high
fares," says Mr. Beauvais. "Heck, we're going to make a lot
of money. We have a responsibility to our shareholders. But
I'm not so sure that's good for the traveling public. But if
we're one of the oligopolists, we'll laugh all the way to the
bank."
                                                                                                       

   ROBERT CRANDALL
   Chairman, AMR Corp.,
   American Airlines
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Crandall is a big backer of deregulation and of the
free market forces it unleashed on the airline industry.
"Most of us are better companies because of the intensity of
competition that has emerged," he says.
   But he does see problems ahead, "I'm not at all sure that
if only two or three or four of us survive, we're not going
to get very oppressive regulation because only three or four
of us continue to exist. Now I don't think that's an
appropriate response. . . . Competition may be even more
intense if there are only three or four of us than if there
are only six or seven of us."
                                                                                                       

   ALFRED CHECCHI
   Chairman, NWA Inc., Northwest Airlines
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Checchi says he started hearing about possible
transactions shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.
"Within a couple weeks, the phone calls started. What you end
up with are calls saying, `Have you thought of . . .'" he
says. "You saw certain assets being put on the market. People
were soliciting interest.
   "This consolidation process is upon us," says Mr. Checchi.
"Everyone is talking to everyone. You're seeing an awful lot
of transactions." He says his investor group acquired
Northwest in August 1989 because "the attraction was the
industry was going to go into consolidation over the next ten
years. The process is being sped up by the financial
dislocation caused by the Gulf."
   By the end of the decade, he figures there will be four to
five airlines, at the most. "I think it's the nature of the
airline business that its economics argue for larger
companies rather than smaller ones," he says.
                                                                                                       

   HERB KELLEHER
   Chairman, Southwest Airlines
                                                                                                       

   The recent moves in the industry are no suprise to Mr.
Kelleher. "A lot of people have been saying for a goodly
number of years that with a downturn, there'd be a lot of
consolidation in the industry. We're just going through the
second round now."
   Mr. Kelleher pooh-poohs the notion that consolidation on
this scale leads inexorably to re-regulation. "If you were to
say having a few carriers is a reason why the airline
industry should be regulated again, there are about 42 other
industries that should come first because they have even less
competition," he says. "You can have very strong competition
between a relatively few firms."
   Does this mean the big players will buy everything? "They
ain't gonna buy us," Mr. Kelleher maintains.

   Marketing and Stations, Delta Air Lines
                                                                                                       

   Although Delta is the only major healthy airline not to
enter into a transaction yet, Mr. Hawkins says the carrier is
ready to buy. "Anything that looks good to us, we'll do it,"
he says. "We've made it known we'd like to have gates on the
north side of B concourse" at the Atlanta airport. Those
currently belong to troubled Eastern Airlines, which shares a
hub with Delta in Atlanta. "And we've made no secret about
talking to Continental about Pacific routes."
   Mr. Hawkins says the recent shakeout is good for the
industry: "We probably could use a little settling in our
industry. There's a lot of chaos. And a lot of people going
broke, knee-jerk reactions. It has an unsettling effect on
our people and the traveling public."

   Senior Vice President of Finance
   UAL Corp.'s United Airlines
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Valerio says the sudden rise in jet fuel prices
following the Iraqi invasion "accelerated the need for the
weaker carriers to do something."
   Mr. Valerio says "weak balance sheets" will continue to
drive the financially troubled carriers to sell assets, and
the industry to consolidate. Calling the current
consolidation the "first cut," he adds: "There are some
carriers that are clearly not going to make it." He figures
consumers will benefit because they will get "stronger"
carriers to fly.

   Fiscal 1992 Cuts of Nearly
   $3 Billion Beyond Pact
   Are Envisioned in Plan

   WASHINGTON -- The White House budget office wants to pare
Medicare spending next fiscal year by nearly $3 billion
beyond the cuts stipulated in this fall's deficit-reduction
accord with Congress.
   The additional cuts would result from reducing
reimbursements to hospitals and physicians, not from making
beneficiaries pay more, according to Bush administration
officials and documents describing the budget office's
recommendations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Medicare changes are among those being considered as
the administration drafts its fiscal 1992 budget proposal, to
be released in February. Senior administration officials said
that President Bush appears unlikely to push a major package
of tax cuts and reductions in government benefits programs,
but that he still could decide to do so.
   For fiscal 1992 through 1995, the remaining four years of
the five-year deficit-cutting accord, the administration
plans to seek about $14.1 billion in Medicare cuts beyond the
$39 billion agreed to for those years in the budget
legislation. Medicare spending amounts to nearly $100 billion
a year.
   No major changes in Medicare are included in the
recommendations presented by the budget office this week to
the Health and Human Services Department. The administration
plans only minor changes in the Medicaid health-insurance
program, which serves the poor and was expanded significantly
by Congress earlier this year.
   The budget office decisions aren't final. HHS officials
said they expect to appeal some parts of the proposed budget
for their agency, but declined to say if they will contest
the Medicare change.
   The $3 billion in Medicare savings could be used to
finance increases in other government benefits or tax cuts --
or could simply be used to reduce the deficit. The budget
documents don't say, and administration officials said a
final decision hasn't been made.
   For fiscal 1992, which begins next Oct. 1, the budget
office wants to slice Medicare spending by an additional $2.7
billion beyond the $5.8 billion required by the
deficit-reduction accord. The proposed cuts include reducing
the rate of subsidies to large research hospitals. Most of
the new proposals were brought up in this year's budget
negotiations.
   The budget office also is seeking to trim payments to
doctors by $250 million in fiscal 1992 and $2.7 billion over
five years, and plans to offer Congress a list of suggested
ways to meet the goal, a summary of the budget office
recommendation indicates.
   The new budget proposals call for no further cuts in
Medicare reimbursements to hospitals for construction or
equipment purchases.
   To improve enforcement of laws requiring private insurers
and employers to cover certain expenses of Medicare
beneficiaries, the budget office suggested setting up a
clearing house with a $5 million budget to gather information
on employer-provided or other outside health-insurance
coverage. It recommended adding a line to W-2 forms -- which
employers provide to the Internal Revenue Service for each
employee -- to disclose if employees have insurance coverage.
   One of the most controversial parts of the nearly $500
billion deficit-cutting plan was the provision slicing more
than $42 billion from Medicare, the federal government's
insurance program for the elderly and disabled, from fiscal
1991 through fiscal 1995. To achieve the savings, the
administration and Congress hit beneficiaries by raising
premiums and increasing the deductible. They also cut
reimbursements to doctors, hospitals and other health-care
providers.
   The summary of the budget office recommendations also
details an explosion in costs of the Medicaid program, which
is administered by the states. In the past four months, the
estimated cost of Medicaid for fiscal 1992 has grown by $3.2
billion, to $57.2 billion. The budget office recommended
improvements in state Medicaid reporting and estimating
practices.

   Merck Develops Drug to Combat Virus
   Causing AIDS; Human Tests Begun

   Merck &amp; Co. disclosed that it has developed a novel type
of drug for fighting the AIDS virus, and that it started
pilot tests of the drug in humans last month.
   The drug was developed with unusual swiftness in less than
six months. It marks the first entry by the Rahway, N.J.,
drug maker into the world-wide effort to develop medicines to
defuse the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV-1, the virus
that causes AIDS.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The drug works by deactivating an enzyme called reverse
transcriptase that is necessary for HIV-1 to reproduce. The
pharmaceutical company said its new drug is different from a
drug reported just two weeks ago by researchers at Boehringer
Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals. The Boehringer and Merck drugs,
however, both work against the reverse transcriptase enzyme
in a manner that differs significantly from AZT, the only
drug now approved for use against the virus.
   While officials at Boehringer in Ridgefield, Conn., and at
Merck said that laboratory tests of their enzyme-blockers
show the drugs are more potent than AZT, officials aren't
certain that the new drugs are less toxic than AZT, or that
the drugs will work in people.
   Merck, however, appears to be ahead of Boehringer in
finding those answers since it began human-safety tests of
its new compound in an unnamed site in Europe last month.
Just last week, Merck began similar safety tests at the
National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., administering
the drug to people who are infected by HIV-1 but who have not
yet developed problems in their immune systems.
   Actually, Merck said it is testing two separate, but
closely related, compounds, hoping that one of them works.
   Even so, officials at Merck were reluctant to talk about
the drugs or their prospects. "We never before have discussed
drugs this early because development at this stage is
completely unpredictable," said Edward M. Scolnick, head of
Merck's research operations. "One in five drugs at this stage
fail, and that could happen to these."
   Merck released information about the drug after it began
receiving recent inquiries. The company had hoped to keep its
research quiet until current tests indicate effectiveness.
   Dr. Scolnick said that in April, Merck found a chemical
that blocked the enzyme after testing about a thousand
compounds developed over the years. "We realized right away
we might have something," Dr. Scolnick said.
   He said the company's chemists and other researchers
performed a "heroically fast job" of developing the compounds
into drugs that could be absorbed into the bloodstream, and
then testing the drugs for toxicity in animals.
   Merck said the early animal tests suggest the drug has
minimal toxicity problems. It declined to comment on early
results from the human tests, but did acknowledge that tests
in Europe were continuing, an indication that the drugs
aren't causing major problems.
   News of the Merck drug is the most recent in a flurry of
reports by drug makers who are racing after ways of fighting
the AIDS virus, although none of these new drugs have yet
shown to be effective or safe. A Merck spokesman said the
company plans to publish the new drug discovery, but that the
finding is so recent it hasn't yet been accepted by a
research publication.

   NEW YORK -- The dollar rocketed higher and Europe's
financial markets reeled as a growing threat of political
instability in the Soviet Union stunned international
investors.
   The U.S. currency gained as international investors sought
safety in the face of probable political turmoil. At one
point, the dollar was up 2.5% on the day against the mark,
and it remained nearly that high late in the New York trading
session. The rush to dollars was triggered by the sudden
resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, a
move that called into question the stability of the Soviet
Union.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   European financial markets were shaken by the news. The
German stock market plummeted 3.3%. Prices of German 10-year
government bonds, or bunds, fell nearly 1%. Italian stocks
were off 3%, Norway's market lost 2.8%, and both the French
and Austrian stock markets were down 2.3%. The London stock
market, Europe's largest and most liquid, fared better than
most others. It was off slightly less than 1%.
   U.S. financial markets tended to shrug off the Soviet
Union's problems. Treasury bond prices were off for the day,
but the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.73 points to
close at 2629.46 in active trading.
   Some analysts suggested that the lingering Persian Gulf
crisis is taking a back seat, at least in European investors'
minds, to the Soviet Union's internal problems.
   "The Soviet risk is the real political risk," said Anne
Parker Mills, a currency strategist at Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   Yesterday's rush to the dollar went a long way toward
restoring the U.S. currency's tarnished reputation as a
haven. The dollar's failure to gain significantly after
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait led many analysts to
question that traditional role for the currency. But its
sharp rise yesterday, coupled with drops in both the Swiss
franc and gold, indicated that the dollar still commands the
respect of international investors despite a weak U.S.
economy and falling U.S. interest rates. If the Soviet
Union's political situation deteriorates further, analysts
predict, the dollar will continue to climb.
   "At some point," Ms. Mills said, "the European investor
will say, `I don't care whether I get a lower rate of return
on dollar assets, and I don't care if the U.S. is in a
recession. I want to increase my holdings in the U.S. because
the dollar is the only real safe haven currency.' That move
may have begun in earnest."
   Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation is important because of his
close association with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and
with Mr. Gorbachev's program to liberalize the Soviet Union
internally and conduct a more accommodating foreign policy.
Mr. Shevardnadze also is well known and respected outside the
Soviet Union. Analysts said his resignation raises the
possibility of two dangerous scenarios: either a return to a
hard-line dictatorship in Moscow or the ultimate breakup of
the Soviet Union.
   Turmoil in the Soviet Union has a direct and pronounced
effect on European markets, particularly Germany's, because
of Germany's proximity to Eastern Europe and the fact that
Germany is Moscow's largest trading partner in the West.
   "Germany was the market that benefited the most" from the
political and economic changes in Eastern Europe, said Steven
Keddell, a first vice president at Deutsche Bank Capital
Corp. in New York. Therefore, German markets stand to suffer
most from a reversal of those changes, he said.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   U.S. stock prices were mixed. Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange totaled 174.7 million shares. Declining issues on
the Big Board were ahead of gainers, 813726.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
lost 5/8 of a point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount.
The yield on the issue rose to 8.23%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar rose sharply. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.5115 marks and 135.85 yen, compared
with 1.4785 marks and 134.05 yen late Wednesday.

   Soviet politics are byzantine, so yesterday's resignation
of Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze needs careful
interpretation. One hard-line Communist in the Congress of
People's Deputies called it a "maneuver," obviously meaning
that he suspects Mikhail Gorbachev himself staged it as a
jolt against the right, which has been disturbing his
balancing act lately.
   Any such guess, however, is overwhelmed by one certainty:
Time is running out on Mikhail Gorbachev. Serious forces --
some with guns -- are lined up on left and right. This
dangerous political confrontation has a backdrop of economic
chaos. Production and exports are falling, foreign debt
service costs are rising and creditors are dismayed. The
Soviets are courting the IMF and World Bank, but even those
institutions exercise some prudence.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These powerful forces cannot be contained forever. Had Mr.
Gorbachev been as wise as his Western admirers believed, he
would have recognized long ago that the Soviet Union's future
-- if it has one -- lies in the center yielding to a
voluntary confederation of the separate republics. That
process already has begun in defiance of the Kremlin.
   Instead, he drafted a union treaty designed to preserve
the center's power, only to stir cries of outrage from the
republics. In a New York Times article this week, Izvestia
political columnist Melor Sturua, now a Harvard fellow,
called on Mr. Gorbachev to resign while his place in history
is secure, saying, "There is no wind left in his sails, and
the promised land is as far away as before."
   Mr. Gorbachev's popularity rating has fallen drastically
-- one poll puts it at just over 20%. Public backing has been
rising for Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin, who is
crafting a new Russian constitution that contains genuine
economic reforms. As his popularity grows, Mr. Yeltsin
becomes more assertive, as he was after Mr. Gorbachev, in a
speech to the congress on Wednesday, once again threatened
"direct presidential rule" -- or martial law, if you prefer
-- in Soviet trouble spots.
   "The time of commands from the Kremlin is past," declared
Mr. Yeltsin. Mr. Gorbachev, who unlike Mr. Yeltsin has never
faced a popular election, could only bluster in reply about
"rotten roots" of populism, a remark unlikely to endear him
to the Soviet people.
   Of course it would be imprudent to ignore the political
forces of the right. While it's hard to read the Gorbachev
mind, his tough talk is surely designed in part to appease
the hardliners who are demanding the use of internal security
troops in what could be a bloody, last-ditch effort to save
the union and the Communist Party. He seems only to have
whetted their appetites, however.
   Mr. Shevardnadze singled out the hard right in his
resignation speech. Referring to parliamentarians "with
colonels' shoulder-stripes," he said that they "have been
able to remove the interior minister and now it's time to
settle scores with the foreign minister." He was referring to
Mr. Gorbachev's appointment late last month of hard-liners
Boris Pugo and Boris Gromov as Nos. 1 and 2 in the ministry
responsible for internal security. General Gromov, a hero of
Afghanistan, has since been recruiting army units for
internal security duty, an ominous sign.
   The "colonel" cited by Mr. Shevardnadze apparently was
Nikolai Petrushenko, one of the leaders of the hard-line
Soyuz faction credited with forcing the interior
appointments. When this Congress opened, Mr. Gorbachev was
presented with a demand by 53 leading conservatives,
including Armed Forces Chief of Staff Mikhail A. Moiseyev,
that he employ direct rule against secessionist forces. Mr.
Shevardnadze also spoke at length of opposition to his
cooperation with the U.S. over the Persian Gulf, suggesting
military uneasiness over giving up overseas adventures.
   And before that, KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov had
appeared on TV -- unprecedented for a KGB chief -- to demand
restoration of "law and order." He later expanded his brief
TV message in an interview with Izvestia (excerpted nearby),
raising Stalinist images. For example, he deplored "economic
sabotage," which he described as a term that "people
understand." Indeed they do. "Economic crimes" sometimes were
punished by death in the good old days. The KGB chief
blatantly called on Soviet citizens to once again indulge in
that old Stalinist sport, denouncing one's neighbors.
   Mr. Gorbachev has prevailed on Mr. Shevardnadze to stay on
for a while, though a Foreign Ministry spokesman says the
resignation is "irreversible." But clearly Western leaders,
George Bush in particular, should be worried. As Mr.
Shevardnadze pointedly warned, if you create a dictatorship
you can never be sure who the next dictator will be. What
would you think of Vladimir Kryuchkov as the next candidate
to help the West dismantle the Cold War?

   College Bowl Sponsors
   Changing Games' Names

   IN COLLEGE bowl games, sponsors grapple with how to score
in the name game.
   Over the past four years, corporate sponsors have rushed
to put their names on 12 of 19 college football bowl games.
Despite spending millions of dollars, companies find their
names often slip through the cracks because of inconsistent
media treatment.
   For example, Chrysler calls the game to be played on
Christmas Day the Eagle Aloha Bowl, after its Jeep/Eagle
division. That's also how USA Today and the Gannett News
Service refer to it. But in Associated Press stories and this
week's TV Guide, it's simply the Aloha Bowl.
   This year, marketers will be closely watching the results
of two so-called sole-title sponsorships. Blockbuster
Entertainment, the video-rental chain, is spending $2.5
million to create the first Blockbuster Bowl. And for the
second year, the former Sun Bowl will be called strictly the
John Hancock Bowl. "We're in this for one thing: visibility,"
says Jack Mahoney, who directs sports marketing for John
Hancock Financial Services.
   "This kind of exclusivity may be the focus of the future,"
says Frank Potter, director of marketing for Joyce Julius &amp;
Associates, publisher of Sponsors Report, which monitors
sponsor exposure in televised sports events.

   Scrambling to Reach
   Yanks Working Abroad
                                                                                                       

   EXPATRIATE executives have to be one of the most
attractive yet elusive targets in marketing. Now, a handful
of companies are developing new ways to reach this mostly
scattered audience.
   It's no easy task. Ads, for example, won't help much -- no
single periodical or television or radio station effectively
reaches the estimated three million Americans working abroad.
   But for some companies, it's worth the effort. Executives
abroad represent a demographic gold mine. According to
Citibank, the typical U.S. executive working overseas is a
41-year-old married man with children and an annual income of
at least $100,000.
   Enter Living Abroad Publishing, a company based in New
York that's preparing to launch two guidebooks for executives
living and working in Europe and Asia. The $45 guides include
information on tax and financial services, travel, children's
education and medical services, such as lists of hospitals
abroad that accept U.S. insurance policies.
   Citibank, one of the guide's sponsors, hopes to get a
boost for its own program, Personal Banking for Overseas
Executives. The service, which evolved out of the bank's
in-house program for international staffers, handles
transactions such as paying mortgages for U.S. homes and
insurance premiums. Citibank found that people about to ship
out rarely give much thought to banking. So the bank has been
working with providers of more obvious expatriate services,
such as relocation consultants and language schools, to boost
its program's visibility.
   Says Jon B. Clements, president of Clements &amp; Co., a
Washington, D.C., firm that specializes in insurance for
foreign service workers and is increasingly targeting
executives abroad: "The market is endless."
                                                                                                       

   Coke Wins a Round
   In Fight With FTC
                                                                                                       

   THE SOFT-DRINK industry has emerged from under a cloud, at
least for now.
   In a case stemming from its aborted attempt to acquire Dr
Pepper in 1986, Coca-Cola last week was handed a victory in
an antitrust battle with the Federal Trade Commission.
Administrative Law Judge Lewis Parker could have ordered
Coca-Cola, the nation's No. 1 soft-drink company, to seek FTC
clearance to acquire any soft-drink or bottling operation for
10 years.
   Such a ruling, which the FTC sought, could have profoundly
reshaped the nature of competition in the
marketing-intensive, $44 billion soft-drink business. An
unfettered PepsiCo, for instance, could have scanned the
beverage landscape and cherry-picked bottlers or smaller
root-beer or specialty soft-drink companies, while Coca-Cola
would have to wade through the federal bureaucracy to pull
off any deals.
   Coca-Cola won't comment on the ruling, which the FTC says
it may appeal.
   The ruling "could have handcuffed Coke's abilities to deal
in a hotly competitive marketplace," says Jesse Meyers,
publisher of Beverage Digest newsletter. Also, industry
executives fretted that the case could have led to
governmental interference with other soda companies.
                                                                                                       

   Odds &amp; Ends
                                                                                                       

   CARRYOUT rip-offs were uncovered in an undercover sweep of
254 delis, salad bars, bakeries and supermarkets in New York.
City inspectors estimate that paying for the weight of salad
containers alone costs New Yorkers $12 million a year. . . .

   REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   Kansas City Plantation

   The Liberal Plantation is fighting back in Kansas City.
Last month, 57% of voters passed a draconian retroactive
two-term limit on the mayor and city council. Some city
council members sued to keep their jobs on the grounds that
term limits are racist, an argument a federal judge threw out
this week. The sponsor of the initiative, black businessman
Henry Lyons, now hopes to carry the term-limit message to
other cities with large minority populations.
   Kansas City has a history of machine politics: The
whites-only Pendergast machine of the 1930s had such
efficient "ghost" voting that in one election it recorded
more votes than the number of registered voters. Today, the
minority areas of Kansas City are dominated by Freedom Inc.,
which began as part of the civil-rights movement in the
1960s, but has since become a political machine dependent on
government patronage jobs and sweetheart public contracts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Lyons challenged its viselike grip on the polls with a
term-limit measure that will force nine of the 13 city
council members to leave office in March. Councilmen Charles
Hazley and Robert Hernandez filed suit in federal court
charging that term limits will elect only "safe" minorities
who will not challenge the status quo. Using an argument
certain to be echoed by other officeholders, they claimed in
court that while "they are not indispensable to their
constituents, their experience is." Mr. Lyons's attorney,
Terry Brady, replied that term limits allow voters to elect
other qualified minorities or to elect a city council
incumbent to another office.
   Federal Judge Howard F. Sachs ruled that while he thought
term limits were bad public policy, they violated neither the
Constitution nor the Voting Rights Act. In court, Mr. Brady
had asked Mr. Hazley, a five-term councilman who is temporary
chairman of Freedom Inc., if Mr. Lyons was black. "To the
best of my knowledge," Mr. Hazley replied. Mr. Hernandez
answered by saying there was "some question" about Mr.
Lyons's race. After a pause he added, "He's black, he's
black. I'm just angry and nervous."
   Mr. Hazley admitted that term limits are "race neutral,"
but argued that in practice they discriminate. He said the
campaign for term limits was racially motivated, but produced
no real evidence. Indeed, he admitted that Freedom Inc. had
circulated flyers calling term limits "a racist, bossist,
plantation-style effort to destroy our community." Despite
such tactics, term limits won 44% of the vote in heavily
black areas. Nationwide, polls show blacks are likelier to
support term limits than are whites.
   Mr. Lyons says that far from being racist, term limits
will allow "other voices in the minority community to be
heard." In some cases, term limits could mean more minority
representation, since white incumbents often hold on to
districts that have changed demographically simply because of
incumbent advantages.
   Of course, none of this matters to the proprietors of the
Liberal Plantation of Kansas City. Their only response is to
cry "racism" at every turn. Their arguments instead have the
familiar ring of attempts to maintain a system of
paternalistic political power.

   Spending on Health Care
   Climbed 11.1% Last Year

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. health-care spending climbed more than
11% last year, according to a government report.
   A Department of Health and Human Services report showed
that health-care spending totaled $604.1 billion in 1989, an
11.1% increase from $544 billion in 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan said in a statement that the
numbers disclosed a continuing but alarming trend. "Steep
increases in health costs are limiting access to health care
and imposing a heavy burden on individuals, industries and
government," he said.
   "It doesn't come as a surprise," said Gail Wilensky,
administrator of the department's Health Care Financing
Administration. "It shows our continuing inability to reduce
high rates of spending on health care."
   In 1989, Americans spent $530.7 billion on personal
health-care services directly benefiting the patient -- an
increase of 10.6% from 1988. The U.S. inflation rate during
the same period was only 4.8%.
   "It may be incredible, but its been the same incredible
numbers for years," said Mark Pauly, professor of health-care
systems at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
   The report attributed the increased spending to inflation,
including health-care-related costs, as well as to the
growing number of older Americans.
   Health-care expenditures grew to 11.6% of the nation's
gross national product in 1989 from 11.2% in 1988. In 1979,
heath-care spending made up only 8.6% of GNP.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Democrats Drop Surtax on Millionaires
   As No. 1 Order of Business in January

EXECUTIVE (EXE)

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- House Democratic leaders no longer plan to
make a proposed surtax on millionaires the top order of
business when Congress returns in January.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee, said he told President Bush Tuesday
that he wouldn't reintroduce the bill immediately, as he had
planned. "I am not interested in pushing it," the Illinios
Democrat said yesterday. "I don't want to talk about these
things until I see what's in the president's budget."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For his part, the president indicated to Rep. Rostenkowski
that he wouldn't include his twice-failed proposal to reduce
capital-gains taxes as part of his fiscal 1992 budget request
early next year. He told Rep. Rostenkowski he didn't know how
the tax cut could be paid for under the new pay-as-you-go
budget law. Mr. Bush publicly made similar comments the same
day. But administration officials are split on whether to
include the proposal in his budget, and top aides say the
president hasn't made a final decision.
   The shelving of the two issues would defuse for the short
term the conflict between the parties over tax fairness. In
this year's budget fight, Democrats scored political points
by contrasting their own support for taxing the rich with
Republicans' drive for lower taxes on capital gains, which
mostly benefit top-income taxpayers.
   In October, the House approved a budget plan that included
Rep. Rostenkowski's provision for a 10% surtax on individuals
with taxable income of more than $1 million, which would
raise an estimated $7.6 billion over five years. Neither the
surtax nor the capital-gains proposal were included in the
final budget compromise.
   Rep. Rostenkowski previously had said that he wanted to
reintroduce a proposed surtax on millionaires and that it
would be tagged as the House's first bill, HR 1, a mainly
symbolic designation that Democratic leaders reserve for
their top-priority legislation. Yesterday he said, "I think
the American people are tired of taxes," whether it's a
millionaires' tax or a general surtax to pay for the Persian
Gulf deployment -- an idea Rep. Rostenkowski raised earlier
this month.
   His change of mind on the millionaires' surtax -- and the
president's on capital gains -- would mark a sort of truce
between the two old friends. But some House Democrats also
are concerned that spotlighting higher taxes as a party
priority, even when those taxes are targeted to wealthier
Americans, could boomerang politically.
   Nevertheless, the surtax is all but certain to resurface
eventually. Democratic leaders, and House members generally,
still believe the issue is potent politically. Also, under
the new pay-as-you-go budget rules, more revenues are
essential to cover any spending initiatives or tax cuts.
House Democratic leaders are considering the surtax as a way
to offset some tax cut for the middle class.
   The surtax "will be appended to any proposal to spend
money," predicted Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.), a Ways and
Means member who favors using any such revenues for
children's programs. "It is everybody's first, favorite way
to increase taxes to pay for things."

   California Rulings May Limit Worker Suits

   In three closely watched labor-law cases, the California
Supreme Court delivered two rulings that favor employers and
one that aids employees.
   The court issued two rulings that could limit employees'
ability to seek damages for emotional distress stemming from
wrongful discharge. But in a third case, the court ruled that
an employee can bypass the state civil-rights agency to sue
in the courts for wrongful-discharge damages in sexual
harassment cases.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The cases were important to businesses because they speak
to an expensive problem: employees seeking increasingly large
damages for "pain and suffering" caused by wrongful
termination.
   The court's rulings were "a mixed bag," said Paul
Grossman, general counsel for the California Employment Law
Council, an association of major businesses. But they
"indicate that California isn't going to be way out in crazy
land by itself with respect to compensatory and punitive
damages in routine discharge disputes."
   In one case, Shoemaker vs. Myers, the court ruled that, if
an employee sues for damages stemming from wrongful
termination, any disabling injuries -- mental or physical --
fall under the coverage of workers' compensation, which
strictly limits the amount of money that can be awarded. But
the court ruled that an employee can sue for damages outside
workers' compensation if there are statutory exceptions or if
the discharge resulted from risks that aren't within the
compensation bargain.
   Jack Shoemaker, an investigator with the state health
department, was fired in 1981 after he reported a superior's
illegal activities. Reinstated the next year, Mr. Shoemaker
sued for damages for emotional distress and humiliation. The
court ruled that, under the state's statutes to protect
"whistle blowers," Mr. Shoemaker is allowed to sue for
damages outside the provisions of workers' compensation.
   Although it is a victory for whistleblowers, the ruling
was seen as a confirmation of the increasingly conservative
tone taken by California's high court, which has eviscerated
thousands of lawsuits by employees seeking punitive damages
for wrongful discharge. Until now, though, the use of
compensatory damages for "pain and suffering" remained "the
one area of possible tort recovery that could really sting
employers," said Stanford University labor-law Prof. William
Gould. With the Shoemaker ruling, "they've deprived
plaintiffs of one of their most important weapons."
   In a second case, the Court ruled that the state civil
rights commission doesn't have the right to award damages for
emotional distress for employment discrimination. In the
case, a temporary secretary, Rose Brown, charged that she was
sexually harassed by a superior at Peralta Community College
where she worked in 1981 and 1982. The Fair Employment and
Housing commission awarded Ms. Brown $20,000 in damages, an
award that was overruled by a trial court, which argued that
the commission couldn't award damages for trauma and
humiliation. Overturned in an appeal, the ruling was
reinstated by the Supreme Court.
   The third case, Rojo vs. Kliger, involved an employee,
Emma Rojo, who charged that she refused her employer's
demands for sexual favors, which ultimately forced her to
quit the job. The Court ruled that the sexual harassment
involved violated Ms. Rojo's common law rights and therefore
that Ms. Rojo can bypass the provisions of the state civil
rights act and sue for damages in court.

   PHILIPPINES SETTLES litigation over Marcos properties in
Manhattan.
   The Philippine government sued Ferdinand Marcos and his
wife, Imelda, in 1986, accusing them of buying four Manhattan
buildings with funds stolen from the Philippines. Mr. Marcos
was ousted as president of the Philippines in 1986, and he
and his family fled to the U.S. Mr. Marcos died in 1989.
   The settlement also ends other related litigation,
including a lawsuit brought by Joseph and Ralph Bernstein
seeking money from the Marcos buildings. The Bernsteins are
real estate developers who managed some of the Marcos
properties.
   Under the terms of the settlement, the Philippines
apparently will get far less than the $160 million of
allegedly stolen money that it claims the Marcoses spent to
acquire the buildings. Two of the buildings have already been
sold, but delays resulted in a much lower price than the
Philippine government had expected.
   The settlement states that if the money from the sale of
the buildings totals $10.8 million or less, the Philippines
will receive 47% of the total, and the Bernstein interests
will receive 20%. The rest will go to Karl Peterson, an
attorney who works for Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi, who
was acquitted last year of illegally helping Mrs. Marcos
conceal her ownership of the buildings. Mr. Peterson's
company also claimed a stake in the buildings. At trial in
federal court in Manhattan, Mrs. Marcos also was cleared of
any wrongdoing in the transactions.
   If the buildings bring more than $10.8 million, the
additional money will be divided with 55% going to the
Philippines, 40% to the Bernstein interests, and 5% to Mr.
Peterson.
   The settlement doesn't state how much money actually will
be available from the sale of the buildings, after
maintenance costs and other expenses. The total amount,
however, is expected to be between $10 million and $11
million.
   The settlement says that the money turned over to the
Philippines "will be paid in recognition of its claim . . .
for monies stolen from the Philippines by Ferdinand Marcos,
Imelda Marcos and certain other non-settling parties."
   Jeffrey Greenbaum, an attorney for the Philippines, said
the settlement was a "moral vindication" of the Philippine
government's position.

   CASINO UNION SAYS it is outraged by government charges of
mob domination.
   "Any allegations that individuals other than {the union's}
membership have influence on our activities are totally
false," said Roy Silbert, the president of New Jersey Local
54 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Union,
at a news conference yesterday.
   The Justice Department filed a civil racketeering suit on
Wednesday against the local, union officers and organized
crime figures. Filed in federal court in Trenton, N.J., the
suit alleges that for the last 20 years the 22,000-member
local has been controlled by a Philadelphia-based organized
crime family and that the family's head, Nicodemo Scarfo, is
running the local now from his federal prison cell.
   The suit calls for a court-appointed trustee to take
control of union affairs. Local 54 represents bartenders,
hotel employees and casino workers in Atlantic City and other
New Jersey towns.
   Mr. Silbert, the local's president for six years, called
the suit "an attempt at government takeover, reflecting the
worst in totalitarianism."
   The union, he said, has told its lawyers at the
Philadelphia law firm Meranze &amp; Katz "to do whatever is
necessary to stop this inexplicable government attempt to
create a media circus."

   MICHAEL MILKEN APPEALS 10-year prison sentence.
   As expected, attorneys for Mr. Milken asked the U.S.
Second Circuit Court of Appeals to review the sentence,
handed down last month by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood. Mr.
Milken, formerly head of the junk-bond operation at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., pleaded guilty in April to six felonies
related to securities transactions.
   Judge Wood said she would consider reducing the sentence
if Mr. Milken cooperated. At the time of his guilty plea, Mr.
Milken also agreed to pay $600 million in fines and
restitution.
   Oral arguments on the appeal are scheduled for the week of
March 18.

   PICTURE-TAKING in federal court in Manhattan will begin in
July.
   The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S.
district court in Manhattan have been selected as test courts
for plans to allow still and video cameras in the federal
courts. Although some state courts allow cameras in
courtrooms, they currently aren't permitted in federal court.
   Another federal appeals court and five other district
courts are expected to take part in the three-year program,
which will apply only to civil cases.

   Concern to Take a Charge,

   Sun Electric Corp. said it plans to report a
fourth-quarter loss and will post a $2.2 million charge in
the quarter to restructure its U.S. automotive diagnostic and
test equipment business.
   In the year-ago fourth quarter, Sun Electric had a loss of
$2.4 million, or 31 cents a share, on sales of $46.7 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Crystal Lake, Ill., maker of auto test and diagnostic
equipment said the restructuring will involve the
reorganization of the company's manufacturing and
distribution operations and a restructuring of its field
sales, service and training organization.
   Sun Electric said it expects that the productivity
improvements and cost reduction measures should help to
offset the effects of competitive pricing pressure in the
domestic marketplace. However, it said, as a result of
current competitive pressures on margins, expenses associated
with establishing a new service industry training program and
certain start-up activities, the company expects a loss in
the fourth quarter prior to the inclusion of the charge and a
$700,000 tax expense.

   LONDON (AP) -- Angola, a major diamond producing nation,
is re-entering the De Beers Centenary AG diamond powerhouse,
ending a five-year absence, De Beers said.
   Endiama, the Angolan state diamond company, and De Beers
agreed to re-establish their relationship, De Beers said.
Angola has been marketing its diamonds independently since
1985, after civil war prompted De Beers to pull out, a De
Beers spokesman said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the agreement, De Beer's London-based Central
Selling Organization will market Angola's diamonds from its
Cuango region, or about three-quarters of the country's
annual production of one million carats, the De Beers
spokesman said.
   De Beers also will provide Endiama with a $50 million loan
to increase production in the Cuango area, and an additional
$50 million over the next five years to develop other diamond
sources in Angola.
   About 80% of the world's annual diamond production is
sorted and sold by De Beers's Central Selling Organization,
which had diamond sales of $4.1 billion in 1989.

   NEW YORK -- Kent A. Logan, PaineWebber Group Inc.'s
managing director in charge of institutional customers,
resigned from the firm.
   Mr. Logan, who couldn't immediately be reached for
comment, in recent years made a name for himself among
institutional investors. PaineWebber has been one of the main
Wall Street brokerage firms to overhaul the way it charges
big institutional investors for stock trading and research --
for example, by taking away free amenities from less-active
investors. Mr. Logan had emerged as one of Wall Street's
spokesmen on such changes in the institutional equity
business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   PaineWebber this year overhauled its capital markets
operations, consolidating all its sales, trading and research
operations for stocks and bonds under one umbrella headed by
Charles Milligan and Margo Alexander. As a result, the
authority of some employees was cut. In August, PaineWebber's
head of takeover-stock trading, William Kaye, resigned partly
for this reason.
   A PaineWebber spokeswoman confirmed Mr. Logan has left the
firm this week, but declined further comment. A successor to
Mr. Logan hasn't been named.

   Tighter Conflict
   Of Interest Rule

   WASHINGTON -- An influential member of the House Banking
Committee said he will seek tougher conflict-of-interest
rules in the financial system, following an investigation of
a director of the quasi-government Topeka Home Loan Bank, who
borrowed $6 million from thrifts he regulated.
   Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) released a report by a
House task force that outlined how Richard H. Hughes, the
director, defaulted on $2.8 million of $6 million in loans.
Mr. Hughes, who served on the Topeka, Kan., bank's board from
1979 until a week ago, also unsuccessfully sought to acquire
two thrifts under the management of the Topeka bank.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Hughes's failure to disclose that he moved from Topeka
to Dallas while he was still a director of the Topeka bank
apparently was his only violation of government regulations.
Rep. Schumer asserted that because Mr. Hughes didn't
specifically violate thrift regulations, his actions clearly
make tougher conflict-of-interest rules necessary.
   "Even the possibility that a government official could own
a thrift for which he might also oversee credit decisions is
extremely troubling," said Rep. Schumer. He added that Mr.
Hughes "epitomizes the inherent potential for
conflict-of-interest that fueled the ongoing thrift crisis."
   Mr. Hughes, also the president of Hinderliter Industries
Inc., Dallas, was removed from his position at the Topeka
bank a week ago, following the conclusion of the
investigation. He was out of his office yesterday and
couldn't be reached for comment.
   Under previous S&amp;L laws, the 12 regional home loan banks
were both a source of housing funds for the S&amp;L industry and
served as thrift examiners and regulators. Last year's
savings-and-loan cleanup law severed that link.
   The home loan banks are currently under the direction of
the Federal Housing Finance Board, an arm of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development. A spokesman for the Finance
Board said that after learning of the House investigation,
HUD Secretary Jack Kemp delayed roughly 25 appointments to
the regional home loan banks, pending review. The Finance
Board will also require more extensive financial disclosure
of the regional bank directors, a spokesman said.
   The actions of Mr. Hughes, first reported in regional and
trade publications, had been challenged by several Topeka
bank employees, the report said. Those concerns particularly
stemmed from his attempt to acquire two S&amp;Ls that were
regulated by the Topeka bank, Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Association of Claremore, Okla., and Valley Federal Savings &amp;
Loan Association of Hutchinson, Kan. Mr. Hughes had borrowed
$1.1 million from Valley Federal that became delinquent. The
thrift was later seized by the government.
   According to the report, Mr. Hughes was asked to resign in
1988 and 1989, and refused. The Federal Housing Finance Board
fired Mr. Hughes the day after receiving a copy of the House
task force report. He was succeeded by Sister Lillian Murphy
of Mercy Housing Inc. in Denver.

   One Man's Mettle
   Proved by Muddle
   In White House

   An administration is supposed to be greater than the sum
of its parts. This is the week the Bush administration proved
that one of its parts -- Michael Williams -- is much greater
than the sum of its principles.
   Mr. Williams is the 37-year-old Education Department
lawyer who advised the Fiesta Bowl that college scholarships
conditioned on race break the law. The resulting uproar, and
partial White House reversal, has proved the mettle of Mr.
Williams, even as it's exposed the intellectual muddle in
this White House.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The reversal had Chief of Staff John Sununu's elbow-prints
all over it. Somehow he concluded that colleges could finance
race-based scholarships with private money after all, though
still not with their own money. By several accounts, Justice
and White House lawyers told him this position was "legally
indefensible." But law gave way to politics.
   The last time Mr. Sununu tried to pretend he was a
civil-rights attorney, he was out-negotiated by Sen. Ted
Kennedy. This time he merely compounded the White House's
legal and political problems. Liberals claimed to be angrier
than ever after the new position, while conservatives spied
another sellout. They were both right. By week's end, senior
aides were hunkered down, says one source, "just hoping the
thing would go away." There's nothing like having the courage
of your convictions.
   All of which must have left the only honest person in this
flap, Michael Williams, asking why he'd taken the education
job. A prosecutor by training, Mr. Williams's real ambition
is to be a U.S. attorney. On Monday morning, he was called to
the White House and later took part in a telephone
conference. But the Sununu Doctrine was created without him.
The "revised" legal opinion was presented to him in the form
of, "How distasteful is it?"
   The answer was very. Yet he still walked the plank with
grace. He purged his own name from the press release but
bravely carried on with a Tuesday press conference. He
admitted to being "politically naive," but he defended the
indefensible as well as possible. In a wonderful irony, Mr.
Sununu was impressed enough to call and congratulate him.
   A few sophists want to blame both Mr. Williams and the
White House. They argue that since scholarships are reserved
for all kinds of categories (such as "colonial descent"), why
not for race too? One answer is that race is especially
combustible. No one riots over scholarships for piccolo
players or Daughters of the American Revolution; the U.S.
fought a war over the rights of blacks. The principle of
"colorblindness" may be unattainable, but as a matter of law
it is the only way to organize a just and stable society.
   Mr. Williams knows this better than rich, white columnists
because he has lived with the consequences of race-conscious
social "remedies." He grew up in Midland, Texas, says friend
Jesse Gaines, "on the other side of the tracks." His parents
taught at segregated schools. Busing forced their
integration, but at the price of shattering the black
community ties of parents with teachers, and parents with
children. That experience made him skeptical of social
engineering of all types.
   Such heresies are said to make Mr. Williams a
"conservative," which only shows how little that label means.
(He has not, so far as I know, declared his views on SDI.)
It's more accurate to say that he is one of those younger
blacks who, like author Shelby Steele, doubt racial
preference really helps the supposed beneficiaries, blacks
themselves.
   They are asking why every black achievement should be
tainted with the stigma of "racial preference." In his
eighth-grade parochial school, Mr. Williams was the only
black; yet he won the math prize, the spelling bee, and was
the best athlete too. "I don't remember us even discussing
issues in terms of race," says his father, John, who still
lives and coaches in Midland. "That may sound odd, but we
just didn't."
   Such thinking puts his son at odds with liberals devoted
to state paternalism. One "journalist" asked him, Wasn't he
"a lackey of the white power structure?" Another accused him
of having accepted a scholarship to the University of
Southern California. He hadn't, so the caller said, Ah,
that's the problem. You didn't need a scholarship. (In truth,
his scholarship ruling would not have denied financing to
needy minorities, only the well-to-do.)
   But Mr. Williams is also an enemy of those Republican
cynics who would exploit the racial preference issue --
"quotas" -- merely to inflame white resentments (and votes).
One of his first official acts was to write a letter opening
the legal way for Polly Williams to begin her educational
choice experiment in Milwaukee. He also has actively opposed
anti-Asian quotas in college admissions in California.
   Mr. Williams supported Mr. Bush's veto of the Kennedy
quota bill, but he wishes the White House would assert a
"positive" civil-rights agenda based on self-help and
economic opportunity. Mr. Williams's legal ruling could have
started that new debate, but the White House muzzled him
instead.
   The U.S. needs an honest debate about civil rights and
racial preference, and somehow they will be debated. If the
White House shrinks from that argument, the vacuum will be
filled by the destructive likes of the just-announced
candidate for Louisiana governor, David Duke.

   NEW YORK -- Program trading accounted for 7.8%, or 15.5
million daily shares, of New York Stock Exchange trading for
the week ended Dec. 7, down from 11.9% the previous week.
General Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. unit and
Susquehanna Investment Group did most or all their trading
for themselves rather than customers, accounting for 40% of
all principal program trading. Bear Stearns Cos., Nomura
Securities, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Daiwa Securities also
traded mostly for themselves. The other firms traded mostly
for customers. Program trading is the purchase or sale of at
least 15 different stocks with a total value of at least $1
million. In the latest week, 42.3% of program trading
involved index arbitrage, in which traders juggle stocks and
stock-index options and futures to capture fleeting price
differences between the markets. About 67.5% of program
trading took place on the Big Board, 28.5% in foreign markets
and 4% in other U.S. markets such as the over-the-counter
market.

   HANCOCK, Mich. -- D&amp;N Financial Corp. said it will post a
large loss for the year and cancel its dividend for the
fourth quarter.
   D&amp;N officials said the company's net loss for 1990 could
be as high as $5.75 million, or about $1.54 a share. The loss
stems from increases in loan-loss reserves that the company
must make largely because of declining real estate values.
The company, whose sole subsidiary is D&amp;N Bank, also said it
will realize losses from sales of certain parts of its
investment portfolio.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   D&amp;N reported a net loss for 1989 of $10.4 million, or
$2.84 a share, as a result of charges to earnings in the
fourth quarter for additions to loan-loss reserves and
balance sheet restructuring. Through the first nine months of
this year, D&amp;N reported net of $800,000, or 21 cents a share,
compared with earnings of $2.3 million, or 63 cents a share,
a year earlier.
   D&amp;N officials said they canceled the dividend in response
to the company's financial position and prevailing economic
problems. "It is the unanimous position of the board that the
long-term interests of all stockholders are best served by
conserving capital, and by entering the new year with a
stronger loss-reserve position in the face of the general
economic downturn and declining commercial real estate
values," said Kenneth D. Seaton, D&amp;N chairman and chief
executive officer.
   The company's third-quarter dividend had been reduced to
7.5 cents a share from a high of 15 cents for several
quarters prior to that. D&amp;N officials said its board will
make decisions about future dividends from quarter to
quarter, as they have in the past.
   But D&amp;N officials added that D&amp;N Bank will report capital
ratios that exceed the higher regulatory minimums that become
effective Dec. 31.
   D&amp;N has financial services offices throughout Michigan's
Upper Peninsula and in mid-Michigan, as well as mortgage
banking operations in Arizona, Illinois, Michigan, North
Carolina and Texas.

   Eastern Airlines
   Loses Court Round
   On Striking Pilots

   Eastern Airlines should have reinstated striking pilots
who returned to work before it put some replacement pilots in
its cockpits, a federal appeals court ruled.
   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that said Eastern, a
Miami-based unit of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.,
shouldn't have favored pilots in training in August 1989 when
returning strikers were available.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for the pilots union said Eastern might have to
pay tens of millions of dollars in back pay. But Eastern said
the ruling won't have any immediate impact, according to a
spokeswoman, because the airline plans to appeal for a
rehearing before the entire 11th circuit. Only about 200
pilots could be affected, she said.
   Eastern was nearly grounded in March 1989 after most of
its 3,600 unionized pilots walked out in support of striking
machinists. But many members of the Air Line Pilots
Association started returning to work several months later
after Eastern began hiring replacement pilots and it became
clear the strike was no longer effective.
   Eastern, however, said it had no jobs for returning
strikers. Instead, it put them on a recall list for pilot
jobs that could become available later. Then, the airline
went to court to have the trainees declared permanent
employees. For a year, Eastern filled vacant pilot jobs by
giving preference to the new-hire list, rather than the
returning striker list.
   The ALPA contended the trainees can't be permanent
replacements under the federal laws that govern airline labor
relations. The 11th Circuit, upholding the district court in
Miami, agreed, saying the trainees hadn't completed the
Federal Aviation Administration-mandated examinations and
hadn't operated any regular revenue flights. "Eastern's
trainees were not actually performing the work ordinarily
discharged by the former strikers," the court said in its
opinion.
   Separately, BHA Aviation Inc., Miami, said it agreed to
acquire an Eastern unit for more than $15 million in cash
plus assumption of debt. The unit, Eastern Express, a small
commuter carrier that flies only in Florida and the Bahamas,
is expected to change hands in January 1991, if the
bankruptcy court overseeing Eastern's Chapter 11 case
approves.
   BHA Aviation is an investor group led by Jack E. Robinson,
who was briefly president of Eastern Express earlier this
year. Eastern Express was formerly Bar Harbor Airways until
August.

   Quits Amid Reports
   Of Pentagon Fraud

   BETHPAGE, N.Y. -- The president of Grumman Corp.'s
military electronics group, Thomas A. Guarino, resigned amid
news reports of defense-procurement fraud allegedly involving
him, a now deceased Long Island businessman, and former
Grumman Chairman John O'Brien, who resigned in July.
   Mr. Guarino's resignation came one day after a Newsday
cover story titled "The Favored" detailed Messrs. Gaurino's
and O'Brien's alleged involvement with the late James T.
Kane, a Long Island businessman who helped run a
now-disgraced political lobbying group representing area
defense firms. Among other things, the article alleged that
Mr. Kane "showered gifts and favors worth hundreds of
thousands of dollars" on Messrs. Guarino and O'Brien while he
did business with Grumman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Although I am innocent of any wrongdoing, suggestions
created by Newsday articles may undermine the confidence
people must feel in me as president of the systems group,"
Mr. Guarino, 52 years old, said in a company-issued
statement. "I reached this painful decision out of the
respect that I feel for the people of Grumman and others, in
government and industry, with whom I have worked. I have
always sought the constructive solution; in this case, I
believe that requires my resignation."
   An attorney said to be representing Mr. O'Brien declined
to comment.
   Grumman systems group, established in April, 1989,
comprises the electronics systems division in Great River,
N.Y, Melbourne systems in Melbourne, Fla., and space systems
in Bethpage. Presidents of those divisions will now report to
Grumman Chairman and Chief Executive Renso L.Caporali, who
succeeded Mr. O'Brien in July.
   Mr. Guarino's stated reason for resigning was in contrast
to that of Mr. O'Brien's, who said only that he was leaving
for personal reasons. As previously reported, before his
resignation, Mr. O'Brien became embroiled in the federal
criminal investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud and
corruption involving Long Island companies, as investigators
stepped up their interest in his ties to Mr. Kane, who died
in February. Federal investigators are trying to determine
whether Grumman officials or their families received loans or
other benefits from Mr. Kane or his firms, according to law
enforcement officials.
   In May, a former shipping manager at Grumman's aerospace
unit pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to defraud the
government by submitting to the Pentagon $300,000 of bogus
bills submitted by a subcontractor controlled by Mr. Kane.
The former Grumman manager is cooperating with prosecutors.

   OMAHA, Neb. -- ConAgra Inc., its results swollen by its
recent $1.34 billion acquisition of Beatrice Co., reported a
38% jump in both earnings and sales for the second quarter
ended Nov. 25.
   The food concern said net income rose to $88.3 million, or
60 cents a share, from the year-earlier $63.9 million, or 52
cents a share. Sales climbed to $5.33 billion from $3.86
billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Per-share earnings reflect an increase in the number of
common and equivalent shares to 137 million from the year-ago
122.7 million. ConAgra, as part of the Beatrice acquisition,
issued seller Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. more than 11
million common shares, along with 142,000 shares of
convertible preferred.
   In addition, per-share figures in the latest period also
reflect the payment of $6.1 million in preferred dividends:
such payments are deducted before per-share earnings are
calculated. In the year-ago quarter, ConAgra had only a
nominal $147,000 in preferred payments.
   The company said its latest earnings were "highlighted by
good earnings balance, aggressive activity in new consumer
products and excellent progress bringing the Beatrice
businesses on board."
   Beatrice earnings, only two weeks of which were included
in the fiscal first quarter results, "to date have been ahead
of plan," ConAgra said.

   AUSTIN, Texas -- The Prodigy electronic network has agreed
to pay $12,500 to the Texas Attorney General's office and
refund money to certain Texas subscribers who may have been
misled by its ads.
   Prodigy, a White Plains, N.Y., joint venture of the
Armonk, N.Y., computer company International Business
Machines Corp. and the Chicago retailer Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,
said in September that it would charge subscribers a fee of
25 cents for each personal electronic mail message in excess
of 30 per month. In the same month, Prodigy mailed about
700,000 ads to Texans, saying electronic mail was free, the
attorney general's office said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Prodigy spokesman said the increased fees were
accurately portrayed to customers and necessary because some
network users were sending out thousands of promotional
messages. Prodigy agreed to settle because charges filed
under the state's deceptive trade practices act would have
been too expensive to defend against, the spokesman said.
Prodigy expects to refund only a few thousand dollars to
users. The payment to the Attorney General's office is
intended to reimburse the agency for investigative costs.
   Last month, Prodigy banned at least seven people who had
protested an increase in its electronic-mail charges. Several
of the banned individuals organized a dissident group that
collected 19,000 supporters.

   SANTA CRUZ, Calif. -- All across the country, universities
have been confronting the problems posed by an increasingly
diverse and contentious society. The future may have already
arrived at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
   Two years ago, at one of Santa Cruz's eight residential
colleges, there was what came to be known as the "Asian Food
Affair." A dinner with Asian (some say, Philippine) food and
themes was planned for early December. A staff member noticed
that the date coincided with Pearl Harbor Day and, following
her suggestion, the Asian celebration was postponed and the
menu changed. When word of the change got out, there were
demonstrations by students in another college, and letters
were written to the press charging racial insensitivity and
racism (for grouping all Asians together, and for seemingly
blaming the living for the actions of certain Japanese long
ago).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite apologies, claims of good intentions and the fact
that the staff member who had recommended the change was
herself of Japanese descent, the champions of tolerance
showed little tolerance. Charges and counter-charges
proliferated, there were resignations, lawsuits and serious
illness induced by stress. The memory lingers.
   Last year, five professors of good will, with diverse
backgrounds and from different fields (biology, philosophy,
literature, linguistics and sociology), got together in an
effort to design an innovative course to meet the challenge
of growing ethnic diversity in the student body and the
growing need for multicultural understanding in the society
at large. They put together a two-quarter "World Culture"
course that studies a number of different societies from a
number of different perspectives. Now a required "core"
course for freshmen at one of Santa Cruz's colleges, the
course is meant to be a model for new multicultural
campus-wide courses. It is being taught this year for the
first time.
   Signs of trouble emerged early. One professor, a
biologist, began a lecture about Darwin with an apology for
speaking about the work of a "dead white male." The same
professor (himself a living white male, originally from
Canada) choked with emotion at a session with other
professors and graduate teaching assistants over the fact
that he was not a member of any oppressed minority.
   A few weeks into the course, another of the professors (a
former Jesuit from Spain) spoke about Islam. As his final
topic, he considered the role of women in Islam, reading
passages from the Koran and from the statutes enacted in Iran
with the coming of the Ayatollah Khomeini. As might be
guessed, the depiction was rather grim.
   After the class, the lecturer received a letter from
another professor in the course (self-described as a "scholar
of color," he is a sociologist who studies race and is
himself black) complaining that he was "deeply disturbed" by
the lecture. He asked for half of the next lecture to
respond. The lecturer refused to yield his time.
   Then there came another of the sessions of professors with
graduate student teaching assistants. The scholar of color
rose and announced that he had been "deeply disturbed" by the
lecture on Islam. He proceeded to spell out what had
disturbed him. It turned out that he did not disagree with
any of the statements the lecturer had made. He believed that
all of the quotations from texts were accurate. Rather, he
was upset at what had been left out. In particular, he noted,
no mention had been made of the fact that the U.S. kills
people in the electric chair, that it had dropped the atom
bomb on people of another race, that for a long period it had
practiced slavery and so on.
   One might have expected the professor who had lectured on
Islam to acknowledge that the U.S. had indeed committed
atrocities in its time, and that it was in many ways as harsh
in its treatment of certain people as some less secularized
Islamic societies may be in their treatment of women, and
then perhaps to have gone on to indicate that it is not
possible to say everything (however true and important) all
the time and in every context.
   But he did not. Instead, he said that while he formerly
had respected the scholar of color, he felt that what was
going on here was a "power play." He charged that the scholar
of color was attempting to set himself up as a standard of
political correctness and conscientious pluralism, allowing
no leeway for those who would make criticisms of another
society (especially if they could not themselves claim to be
among the oppressed). He particularly resented that the
criticism of his lecture had been aimed not at what was said
but at what was not said. When would such bullying criticism
not be in place? Never mind that the two might well agree
about the problems and even horrors of American society. The
ex-Jesuit then walked out.
   Animosities and recriminations flew. People took sides. It
happened that the scholar of color was scheduled to give the
next lecture. Since all the professors (as part of this
innovative model course) regularly attended each other's
lectures (to help establish recurring themes), the ex-Jesuit
threatened that he would walk out in as noticeable a way as
possible if the scholar of color used the occasion to
criticize him before the undergraduates for what he had not
said in his lecture on Islam. The ex-Jesuit was persuaded not
to attend -- but had someone record the lecture for him. The
scholar of color also had the lecture recorded. Apparently
nothing untoward was said.
   While there have been meetings and reconciliations since,
the scholar of color subsequently announced his resignation
from the course, and will not be participating next quarter.
All this in a model course designed to teach students new
approaches to cross-cultural understanding and pluralistic
sensitivity. The former Jesuit, who had grown up in Spain and
taught in Germany and Japan before coming to California,
concluded: "These days, it is not possible to be pluralistic
enough."
   Most recently, two residential colleges pooled resources
to have a "Native American College Night." One might have
thought that this pre-Thanksgiving event was a nicely timed
effort to look at things from another side. It produced an
angry letter to the campus paper from the "Student Alliance
of North American Indians," complaining of the failure of the
colleges to "fully involve" the organization in the planning
of the event. The performance was described as "mediocre,"
and the alliance declared "we cannot support or condone
events which do not involve Native-Americans in the planning
process."
   Does one have to be a member of a given minority in order
to understand that minority, or to say anything about it? In
a university?
   I mentioned at the beginning that the World Culture course
is being offered as a "core" course at one of Santa Cruz's
residential colleges. It is the same college that was the
site of the "Asian Food Affair" (and thus was presumably in
special need of multicultural sensitivity and understanding).
There is now apparently a question about whether the college
will sponsor the World Culture core course for its originally
planned second quarter. The second quarter was supposed to
include consideration of Japanese culture. People are
nervous. . . .

   FRANKFURT -- Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz AG,
said the group's confidence was never greater than it is now
despite "clouds looming in the business sky."
   Mr. Reuter, who oversees Germany's largest industrial
group, said he expects the group's 1990 net income to exceed
last year's net of 6.8 billion marks ($4.6 billion).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The group's 1990 sales are expected to have risen about 5%
to 86 billion marks from 76 billion marks a year ago, the
chairman said. Daimler is scheduled to release its 1990
financial results sometime in February.
   Mr. Reuter also expects 1991 will be a good year, but
declined to elaborate. However, he said he is concerned about
the strong mark, which has led to currency conversion losses
on dollar- and yen-denominated sales, and economic weakness
among Germany's trading partners.
   Germany's economy is expected to grow, but Mr. Reuter
warned of excessive wage demands by workers throughout former
West Germany.
   He said that in the long term, the company might have to
switch some of its production into the "dollar realm" so that
production costs and sales are made in the same currency and
less revenue is lost in the conversion.
   Deutsche Airbus G.m.b.H., the German partner in the Airbus
Industrie consortium, is making losses on its airplane sales.
The results of Deutsche Airbus aren't factored into the
consolidated group results. Mr. Reuter said that talks will
be held with the German government to discuss the losses. The
German government subsidizes currency-related losses on
Airbus jets.
   Mercedes-Benz AG, the vehicle-making arm of the concern,
increased passenger car production by 6% to 572,000 vehicles
this year. In the U.S., despite economic weakness there, the
company sold 75,000 cars in the year, an improvement on last
year. Japanese sales of Mercedes vehicles rose 25% to 40,000.
For 1991, about the same production level as 1990 is planned.
   At AEG AG, the big electronics subsidiary of Daimler-Benz,
1990 sales rose 9% to 13 billion marks in certain key growth
areas like electronics, automation and railroad systems.

   HARTFORD, Conn. -- Standard &amp; Poors Corp. said it lowered
its rating on the claims-paying ability of Travelers
Indemnity Co. Intercompany Pool, the property-casualty
company of Travelers Corp., to double-A from double-A-plus.
   The rating concern said the action on the insurer reflects
S&amp;P's view that "property-casualty conditions will continue
to deteriorate over the near term."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   S&amp;P also downgraded to double-A from double-A-plus its
rating on the subsidiaries of the property-casualty company,
including Charter Oak Fire Insurance Co., Phoenix Insurance
Co., Travelers Indemnity Co. of America, Travelers Indemnity
Co. of Illinois and Travelers Indemnity Co. of Rhode Island.
   This marked the third S&amp;P downgrading of Travelers Corp.'s
businesses since the company announced a $650 million
addition to loss reserves for mortgage loans and real estate
investments and a dividend cut on Oct. 5. S&amp;P has since
reduced its ratings on the senior debt and commercial paper
of the holding company, and the claims-paying ability of
Travelers Insurance Co., the life insurance company, to
single-A-plus from double-A-minus.
   In the property-casualty company's downgrading, S&amp;P cited
its expectation that Travelers Corp.'s problems with its real
estate and mortgage portfolios will leave the
property-casualty business less flexible financially.
   A Travelers spokesman said that the rating action was
expected and that a double-A rating is "considered very
strong."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Travelers shares closed at $17.125, up 12.5 cents, on volume
of more than 1.9 million shares.

   Following are excerpts from an interview with KGB Chairman
Vladimir Kryuchkov that ran in the Dec. 15 issue of Izvestia.
A related editorial appears today:
                                                                                                       

</LP>
<TEXT>
   Izvestia: In public debates, including in the country's
Parliament, it has been repeatedly stressed that most of our
economic and social ills stem from our system, which needs to
be radically changed. Judging from what you have said,
dealers in the shadow economy and saboteurs backed by Western
specialists are chiefly responsible for the shortages and
other irregularities.
   Mr. Kryuchkov: I agree that most of our economic and
social ills stem one way or another from our socioeconomic
system. Not surprisingly, five years ago, we started
wondering whether we could go on like that. Political,
economic and legal reforms began. But, as is known, those who
use unscrupulous means to attain their own ends, often remote
from the people's interests, tend to latch on to any healthy
process -- and people are already trying to exploit certain
weaknesses, certain loopholes in the laws.
   On the one hand, the rapid enrichment of a comparatively
small number of people; on the other hand, a deterioration in
the lives of a substantial stratum of our society. I believe
that those who have dared to exploit the situation should
feel the full force of state and public control. This does
not mean, of course, that we must revert to leveling, to the
system that did immense harm to our economy.
   But can one tolerate sabotage, for instance? There is no
such term as "economic sabotage" in our jurisprudence.
However, the phenomenon exists.
                                                                                                       

   Izvestia: A Supreme Soviet resolution was adopted on Nov.
23. In particular, it gives the KGB the task of combating
sabotage, and many specific instances of exposure by KGB
officers of abuses and thefts could be cited. We report this
in the press -- unsatisfactory transport services, an
enormous number of railway wagons and other transport
standing idle, late deliveries, abuses in sales through the
"tradebotage" -- bearing in mind the phenomenon that existed
70 years ago. But what are the particular features of today's
economic sabotage? How is it being combated in the absence of
an appropriate law?
   Mr. Kryuchkov: do not have in our criminal legislation a
legal norm defining a crime as economic sabotage. In using
the expression economic sabotage, the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet
employed a term that people understand. As far as the
description of the actions embraced by this term is
concerned, that is already a task for the investigation
service and the court, which will, of course, be strictly
governed by the law. I think that those who sabotage the
population's supply of food and industrial goods and allow
them to deteriorate -- either by their own inactivity or
negligent attitude toward their official duties, or who do
this with manifest intent, seeking thereby to obtain selfish
advantage, and those who deliberately create shortages of
goods -- are to be held to account for their actions.
   At any rate, I would like to stress once again that in any
event one should act according to the law, and that no matter
how difficult the situation, it is impermissible to act
outside the law.
   We do not investigate tattletales or tales, though they do
come our way. If anyone wants to cause his neighbors
heartache, that comes within the sphere of purely domestic,
social relations and the state security bodies should not be
involved. The private businessman (not the rogue) can work in
peace, following the laws and norms of human society.
                                                                                                       

   Izvestia: You have spoken about the "destructive role" of
certain newspapers. Which ones precisely?
   Mr. Kryuchkov: Well, what do you think: Do all the mass
media play a constructive role?
   The mass media sometimes give space to those who have
caused serious harm to the state. And the concept of honesty,
justice and purely ethical concepts is eroded. Just see how
the arguments of those who once embarked on a path of
treachery are relished in the mass media. They are portrayed
almost as heroes. A very cautious approach is needed here.
After all, there are concepts of "patriot" and
"anti-patriot." No one has expunged them from life.
                                                                                                       

   Izvestia: Incidentally, the diverse newspapers of the "new
generation" include ones that openly call themselves
"anticommunist" and do not recognize the existing social
system, although they do not advocate its forcible overthrow,
relying on democratic changes. Well, are they to be closed
down? And who is to close them?
   Mr. Kryuchkov: There is nothing criminal in the fact that
someone does not recognize the existing system.
Non-recognition in itself is not an element of a crime. Our
legislation presupposes this possibility. If newspapers do
not campaign for the forcible overthrow of the existing
system but, at the same time, are critical of the system, why
close them down? God forbid that the KGB should take this
function on itself again.
                                                                                                       

   Izvestia: How specifically will chekists control imported
products, for you cannot post a KGB officer at every trade
base or on every train?
   Mr. Kryuchkov: Quite right. Chekists alone will not
resolve the task. Therefore we have turned to society and
asked the Soviet people to report to us information that, in
their view, merits attention. We will make selective checks,
at key moments. We are not thinking of monitoring every trade
base, but I believe that the workers' control groups that
will be set up will get the chekists' support. We are ready
to cooperate with them.

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- NCNB Corp. said it will add about $180
million to $190 million to its loan-loss provision in the
fourth quarter, which it said will cut earnings to the $25
million to $35 million range.
   The banking company's fourth-quarter earnings estimate is
equivalent to 24 to 34 cents a share. A year earlier, NCNB
had net income of $136.2 million, or $1.30 a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The aggressive banking company said net charge-offs in the
current quarter will be $125 million to $135 million. Wall
Street analysts had been expecting a substantially smaller
number around the third-quarter level of $79 million.
   NCNB said the charge-offs cover troubled loans not only in
real estate but in commercial lending, including some of what
are called highly leveraged transactions. Frank Anderson, an
analyst with Stephens Inc. in Little Rock, Ark., predicted
further problems for NCNB despite the large charge-offs and
provision. "I don't think this means a clean-up," Mr.
Anderson said.
   NCNB itself, like other banks that have been forecasting
large provisions for the quarter, said it couldn't be sure
the end of its problems are in sight. "If economic conditions
continue to deteriorate, we anticipate there will be further
additions to loan losses," the company's spokesman said.
   He pointed out, however, that the company still will show
a profit for the quarter and said its dividend is safe. For
all of 1990, NCNB expects to earn $360 million to $370
million, or $3.53 to $3.63 a share.
   The company expects its allowance for loan and lease
losses to rise to about $650 million or $660 million from
$593 million at the end of the third quarter. Nonperforming
assets are expected to rise to a range of $970 million to $1
billion at year's end from $847 million at the end of the
third quarter.
   NCNB, which faces substantial problems on large commercial
real estate portfolios in Florida and North Carolina, said it
also is taking a charge related to a credit card portfolio
that it acquired.

   MOSCOW -- President Mikhail Gorbachev has paid an enormous
price for his attempt to impose more authoritarian rule on
the U.S.S.R.
   Yesterday, in an emotional public speech, Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze resigned, excoriating the political right
wing and warning darkly of a new "dictatorship" taking shape
in his country. His move deprives Mr. Gorbachev of one of his
closest and most liberal allies and dashes the president's
hopes of quickly forging a consensus between left and right
to deal with the social and economic crisis seizing the
nation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though Soviet officials say the resignation won't change
the course of the country's foreign policy, the sudden
resignation is likely to affect Soviet relations with the
West, particularly the U.S. At the very least, it deals a
blow to the twin pillars of George Bush's foreign policy --
his new relationship with the Soviet Union and his coalition
arrayed against Iraq. Mr. Shevardnadze said he quit partly
because his tough stance against Baghdad was being severely
criticized at home. The resignation also points up the
vulnerability of the highly personal diplomacy of Mr. Bush
and Secretary of State James Baker, who in less than two
years in office met with Mr. Shevardnadze more than 25 times.
   For both the Soviet Union and the West, the question yet
to be answered is whether Mr. Shevardnadze's departure will
strengthen the hand of reactionary Soviet conservatives,
particularly in the military, or whether it will pull Mr.
Gorbachev back to a more conciliatory position with his
liberal critics. The former could usher in a dark new era
that would make the Soviet Union a far more unreliable
international partner, while the latter would speed a breakup
of the U.S.S.R. by forcing the Soviet president to cede many
of his powers to the 15 republics.
   "This is a very serious crisis for the president, the
country, and the whole of perestroika," said Sergei
Stankevich, a liberal democrat who is deputy mayor of Moscow.
"I think Gorbachev should take Shevardnadze's step as a very
serious signal that he's too far from the mainstream of the
real reform process."
   Sergei Blagovolin, a military expert at a leading Moscow
think tank, described the resignation as "a tragedy not just
for us, but for everyone."
   Mr. Shevardnadze made his surprise announcement in a
speech before the Congress of People's Deputies, the nation's
supreme legislature. Many of the legislators immediately
asked him to reconsider. But his spokesman, Vitaly Churkin,
called the decision irreversible, adding that only two
people, whom he didn't identify, had known about it.
   Mr. Gorbachev wasn't one of them. Looking grim, the Soviet
president told deputies: "Personally I condemn Comrade
Shevardnadze for acting so without consulting the president."
He said he had held two telephone conversations with Mr.
Shevardnadze following the speech, but still needed time to
analyze the reasons for his resignation. He seemed
particularly upset because, as he revealed, he had been about
to nominate Mr. Shevardnadze to be his vice president, a new
post that he wants to establish as a way to strengthen his
executive powers.
   The resignation may well not spell the end of Mr.
Shevardnadze's public role, however. It may not be accepted
by the congress, and if it is he could wind up back in
government, perhaps as vice president, should Mr. Gorbachev
change tack. A commentator for the TASS news agency even
suggested the decision was more of a tactic aimed at shifting
the domestic political debate rather than a serious showdown
with Mr. Gorbachev.
   Mr. Shevardnadze, 62 years old, gave a variety of
explanations for his action. By far the most damaging to Mr.
Gorbachev, with whom he has worked closely for almost six
years, was his bitter indictment of the nation's increasingly
authoritarian political mood -- a mood fostered by the
president himself. He warned: "A dictatorship is in the
offing -- I tell you that with full awareness. No one knows
what this dictatorship will be like." At the same time, he
called Mr. Gorbachev his friend and pledged continued support
for perestroika, the policy of reform that he helped
implement.
   In recent weeks, Mr. Gorbachev has adopted a harder line
toward the problems of economic decline and national
disarray. In numerous decrees, he has sought to recentralize
economic management and restore law and order, even replacing
his liberal interior minister with a hard-line KGB official.
But most of his instructions have been ignored or
contradicted by the nation's republics, which consider
themselves "sovereign" states in charge of their own affairs.
   Such conflicts have come to a head over a new "union
treaty," which Mr. Gorbachev originally wanted to have
completed by the end of this year, and over a new political
structure that would give the president much greater
executive powers. Four of the 15 republics have explicitly
refused to sign the union treaty, and at least six others,
including Russia, say they have severe reservations about so
much power being centralized in the Kremlin. Likewise, the
new presidential power structure has been attacked by many
republic leaders. Boris Yeltsin, the powerful president of
the Russian republic, on Tuesday accused Mr. Gorbachev of
trying to accumulate more power than even Joseph Stalin.
   Infuriated, Mr. Gorbachev has insisted he isn't a
dictator, though at the same time he has threatened to
overrule decisions made by the republics. Top military
officials and the KGB secret police have strongly supported
him, raising widespread fears that a crackdown could be
imminent.
   But until Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation, the Soviet
president was still attempting to forge a consensus on the
need for stronger central rule and his own more authoritarian
stance. It isn't clear how Mr. Shevardnadze dissented. But
many Soviet analysts say his decision to quit is aimed at
moving the pendulum the other wayforcing Mr. Gorbachev to
reconsider his new alliance with the military and other
hard-liners.
   Galina Sidorova, a foreign-policy commentator for the
Soviet magazine New Times who has covered many of Mr.
Shevardnadze's foreign trips, said she believed he resigned
in order to galvanize moderates into action against the
conservative wave. Others, including Mr. Yeltsin, said they
now expect Mr. Gorbachev to shift ground back to the center,
and thus regain some of his diminishing authority. Still,
many fear that the momentum for a crackdown has now grown too
strong to stop.
   Whatever the domestic repercussions, Mr. Shevardnadze's
departure seems bound to affect Soviet foreign policy. The
soft-spoken minister has played a crucial role in helping to
end the Cold War, allow Eastern Europe to go its own way and,
above all, establish a warm and cooperative relationship with
the U.S. Spurning the traditional ideology and dourness of
his predecessors, he has also frequently denounced the Soviet
military for its past adventures in places such as
Afghanistan. His support of the alliance against Saddam
Hussein, a former Soviet ally, further enraged the military.
In his speech yesterday, Mr. Shevardnadze called the fight
with conservatives over Gulf policy "the last straw" in his
decision to quit.
   In Washington, news of the resignation stunned Bush
administration officials, who have been preoccupied with the
Gulf crisis. Secretary of State Baker tried and failed to
reach Mr. Shevardnadze by phone and hurried to the White
House to discuss the event with President Bush.
   Mr. Baker also scrambled to minimize the damage of the
announcement. In a rare on-camera press conference, he
repeatedly cited Mr. Gorbachev's pledge that Soviet foreign
policy won't change, insisted he wasn't concerned that Iraq
would take comfort from the move, and said that he, like Mr.
Shevardnadze, worried about repression in the U.S.S.R.
Reflecting on Mr. Shevardnadze, Mr. Baker added, "I am proud
to call this man a friend. . . . I'm going to miss him."
   Nonetheless, many officials in Washington worry that Mr.
Shevardnadze's resignation is sure to be read in Baghdad as a
sign that the coalition is weakening, that Iraq still has
powerful friends in the Soviet military and that Moscow might
not support an American-led military strike. So it may
encourage Saddam Hussein to stay in Kuwait, increasing the
chance that the White House would have to resort to war to
oust him.
   "It's a victory for Saddam Hussein," said Marshall
Goldman, a leading Soviet scholar at Harvard University. "It
puts our Persian Gulf policy into doubt because the {Soviet}
military was out to get Shevardnadze and many in the military
have supported Iraq."
   The close relationship Messrs. Bush and Baker had with Mr.
Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, forged in meetings in Moscow,
Malta and Jackson Hole, Wyo., and in many telephone calls,
became the fulcrum of U.S.-Soviet policy. Until now, those
ties pushed into the background concerns over Mr. Gorbachev's
recent embrace of repressive figures and tactics at home.
   Even though Mr. Gorbachev said foreign policy won't
change, he may be forced by exultant hard-liners to install a
more hostile figure in the foreign ministry. "It'll be
surprising if we get a clone of Shevardnadze," said Harvard's
Prof. Goldman. "Gorbachev is probably going to have to find
somebody less accommodating to the U.S."
   One man getting mentioned as a candidate for the job is
Yevgeny Primakov, an ambitious academic and Arabist who is
one of Mr. Gorbachev's advisers. The Saudi Government is
known to dislike Mr. Primakov, which could complicate matters
in the Gulf.
   Beyond the Gulf crisis, the resignation casts doubt upon
the future of broader diplomatic issues such as the strategic
nuclear arms treaty now being wrapped up. Earlier this year,
the military leadership forced Mr. Shevardnadze to withdraw
some Soviet concessions on the treaty, but they were later
largely restored. Now, the generals may be emboldened again,
even though the arms pact is largely complete.
   In any case, if Mr. Bush travels to Moscow as planned Feb.
11 for a summit meeting, the focus is no longer likely to be
on signing the arms treaty, but on finding out where Mr.
Gorbachev stands. In resigning, Mr. Shevardnadze implicitly
asked Mr. Gorbachev whether he is siding with the forces of
democracy or dictatorship.
   The summit may also be forced to dwell on the prospect of
an internal crackdown by Mr. Gorbachev. Any move of this sort
would almost certainly force the White House to shun the
Soviet leader, no matter how agreeable he remains on issues
beyond Soviet borders.
   The Bush administration for months has ignored and even
played down Mr. Gorbachev's efforts to assuage the military
and KGB by acting tougher with dissenters. Last week, Mr.
Bush went ahead with an aid package for the Soviet Union
solely on Mr. Shevardnadze's pledge that any crackdown would
be strictly aimed at quelling crime and ethnic violence, and
wouldn't be used to quash peaceful dissent or fledgling
capitalism.
   But the resignation is sparking wide suspicion among U.S.
experts that, even as he publicly assured the Americans, Mr.
Shevardnadze privately feared a tough crackdown was coming,
including one in his native republic of Georgia.
   "It looks like the deal Gorbachev wanted to impose on the
republics wasn't acceptable to Shevardnadze," says Jerry
Hough of Duke University. "Shevardnadze may have a clear
sense that ugliness is going to occur in Georgia and he wants
history to know he opposed it."
   Within hours of the resignation, Mr. Baker began placing a
new emphasis on concerns about a crackdown. "Our new
relationship with the Soviet Union depends on its continuing
commitment to democratization and to reform," he said at his
press conference. "We would obviously be foolish, I think,
not to take the warning in Minister Shevardnadze's
resignation statement seriously."
   Officials in Washington consider the resignation a
profound event partly because Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr.
Gorbachev have until now generally seen eye to eye. Only last
month, Mr. Gorbachev himself disclosed in a speech that his
foreign minister had been a key figure in initiating the
entire policy of perestroika. Mr. Gorbachev recalled how the
two had met on vacation during the dark days of Leonid
Brezhnev, and had talked frankly about their concerns -- at a
time when such discussions were politically dangerous. "This
is when Shevardnadze said that everything was rotten," Mr.
Gorbachev said.
   After a career spent mainly in the republic of Georgia,
where he eventually rose to head the ruling Communist Party,
Mr. Shevardnadze leapt to national prominence in July 1985,
when Mr. Gorbachev took office. In two days he was promoted
twice, to full membership in the party's Politburo and then
to foreign minister, a field in which he had no prior
experience but excelled.
   Outside the legislative hall yesterday, the public seemed
to sympathize with the man and his decision to resign.
"Shevardnadze fought a good struggle," said Alexander
Chernoshyov, a 21-year-old industrial worker, "but he
understood that it was in vain because an individual depends
on the state, not the state on an individual, so there was
nothing he could do."

   ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said the cost of
inspecting and replacing underground fuel storage tanks to
meet federal environmental guidelines will total $71 million,
far higher than an earlier estimate of $12 million.
   The company, a major Coca-Cola bottler that is 49%-owned
by Coca-Cola Co., made the disclosure yesterday in
conjunction with a new common-share buy-back program,
covering as many as 15 million shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises said the $71 million cost to replace
tanks and clean up the surroundings will be spread out
between 1990 and 1993. It said an earlier $12 million
estimate, covering only 1990 and 1991, was made in its annual
report in March, before the company had completed soil
testing and tank extraction.
   The bottler has a large number of underground tanks around
the nation at various distribution centers for storing
gasoline and diesel fuel for its truck fleet. Under a 1988
federal law, companies with underground fuel storage tanks
must inspect them, replace them as needed, and clean up
leakage.
   Margaret Carton, a spokeswoman, declined to say how many
tanks the company has, how many have been or will be
replaced, or how many were discovered to be leaking fuel.
However, she said all those that had been leaking fuel have
already been replaced and the company is "completely in
compliance with all federal, state and local laws." Company
spokesmen said the concern had discovered some soil and water
contamination, but didn't know the extent.
   Separately, the company said it will buy back shares with
funds from excess cash flow. The period of time for the
buy-back wasn't specified.

   STOCKHOLM -- The chief executive officer of Sweden's
second-largest bank resigned suddenly, intensifying questions
about its recent lackluster financial performance.
   Nordbanken's Rune Barneus, 52, was respected as an
unorthodox but successful banker. But his reputation had been
tarnished in recent months by an acrimonious public battle
with the Swedish Post Office and ballooning loan losses that
forced Nordbanken to slash its forecast for fullyear pretax
profit by 1.2 billion Swedish kronor ($214.9 million), or
37%, late last month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a statement, Nordbanken's chairman Tony Hagstroem
called those credit losses "disturbing" and added that they
made Mr. Barneus's position "difficult." But the bank, which
is 71%-controlled by the Swedish government, offered no other
explanation for the resignation.
   Nordbanken's board was scheduled to meet this afternoon to
discuss a possible successor.
   A year ago, Mr. Barneus reached the pinnacle of his career
to date. Nordbanken, under its previous name PK Banken, paid
5.6 billion kronor to acquire Nordbanken, a medium-sized
regional bank of which Mr. Barneus was president. PK Banken's
previous president, Christer Zetterberg, has been lured away
to head automaker AB Volvo. And gaining the services of Mr.
Barneus -- a former senior executive at PK Banken -- was a
key to the Nordbanken purchase.

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. reserve assets rose $207 million in
November to $83.06 billion.
   The latest figure compares with the $72.57 billion level
of reserve assets in November 1989, the Treasury said. Last
month's rise followed a $2.83 billion rise in October.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   U.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies, gold,
special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund and
the U.S. reserve position at the IMF.
   The Treasury report showed U.S. holdings of foreign
currencies rose $220 million in November to $52.07 billion.
That's up $9.37 billion from November 1989.
   The U.S. gold stock was down $1 million in November to
$11.06 billion from the prior month. A year earlier, it was
at about the same level.
   The country's ability to draw foreign currency from the
International Monetary Fund decreased $195 million in
November to $8.87 billion. That is down from $9.06 billion a
year earlier.
   U.S. holdings of IMF special drawing rights were up $183
million last month to $11.06 billion. That compares with
$9.75 billion a year earlier.

   STOCKHOLM -- SKF AB, the Swedish rolling bearing group,
said it doesn't anticipate any profit for the last quarter of
1990, following a decline in industrial production and
weakened sales.
   A statement from the group said the "fourth quarter is not
expected to contribute to the group's income for 1990." The
company said adverse market conditions had prompted the
company to substantially reduce production in order to adjust
to the lower level of demand.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the nine-month interim period, the company reported
earnings after financial items of 1.78 billion kronor ($318.7
million), which, following the group's announcement, is
probably what the group expects full-year results to be. The
figure represents a 31% drop from 1989, when the group's
profit after financial items was 2.59 billion kronor.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department said it would
review a proposed $625 million deal between TWA and American
Airlines to determine whether the sale of international
routes and airport facilities would violate antitrust laws.
   The department made its announcement after receiving a
request for an antitrust inquiry from Sen. John Danforth (R.,
Mo.) who opposes the sale.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Danforth, in a letter to Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, said the proposed deal "inevitably will lead to a
dramatic reduction in domestic airline competition."
   Danforth is the senior Republican on the Senate Commerce
Committee, which handles airline issues, and has been a
leading critic of consolidation in the airline industry.
Trans World Airlines Inc. has a major hub of operation at the
St. Louis airport.
   AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit earlier this week
proposed buying all of TWA's routes from the U.S. to London
and TWA's takeoff and landing rights at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport. It also would acquire TWA's gates at
the Chicago airport.
   The route sales must be approved by the Transportation
Department, but Sen. Danforth said the Justice Department has
the power under antitrust laws to "investigate and remedy
market practices and structures that deny low-priced
competitive air service to the traveling public."

   BOSTON -- Paul Quirk, executive director of Massachusetts'
public-employee pension fund for six years, announced plans
to resign amid a ruckus over his role in a possible proxy
fight for USX Corp.
   Mr. Quirk, 49 years old, said he would resign effective
Jan. 15, but would continue working on a contract basis until
March 15 to aid the transition to his successor, who hasn't
been named.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Quirk earlier this week withdrew from a five-member
group backed by New York investor Carl Icahn that may launch
a proxy fight against USX next spring. Mr. Quirk also
returned the $15,000 plus 300 shares of USX stock Mr. Icahn
agreed to pay each group member.
   While Mr. Quirk's role in the Icahn group had been cleared
by the Massachusetts fund's lawyers, it drew fire as
inappropriate from some of the fund's nine-member governing
board.
   Mr. Quirk said the latest controversy accelerated
departure plans he disclosed to the fund's governing board
last summer. With a new governor taking office in January,
Mr. Quirk said he had, in any event, intended to leave his
post by the July start of the fund's new fiscal year. He said
he had no job plans yet.
   Mr. Quirk, as executive director of the fund, known
formally as Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment
Management Board, oversaw the retirement system's growth to
nearly $3 billion in assets from about $400 million in 1984.

   BSD Bancorp said it plans to increase its loan-loss

fourth-quarter profit.
   For the full year, the San Diego bank holding company
expects profit to be about equal to nine-month profit of $3.4
million. Fourth-quarter profit last year was $1.4 million, or
40 cents a share; full-year profit was $4 million, or $1.13 a
share.
</LP>

   The company said its reserve increases include $721,000 in
commercial loan write-offs at Bank of San Diego and other
"special reserves" to provide "additional cushion for the
anticipated recessionary environment" next year.
   BSD said its three major banks, including Bank of San
Diego, recently underwent examinations by representatives of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and that "all charge-offs
directed by the regulators have been taken."

   Newmont Mining Corp. told analysts in New York that its

about 200,000 ounces from this year.
   The company had estimated it would produce 1.54 million
ounces of gold in 1990, but that projection was increased to
1.7 million ounces in July. Production in 1990 rose because
an old leach pad at the Gold Quarry mine produced more than
the company expected in 1990. Gordon R. Parker, chairman and
chief executive officer, told analysts that the leach pad
can't be expected to do the same in 1991.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Parker said 1991 cash costs for gold production will
be under $240 an ounce, compared with $215 in 1990. Energy,
labor and material costs will increase, he said.

   A Piranha Fishing Trip Would Do

   If shopping for that special someone is a trying
experience, how about trying an experience as your gift?
   Like a four-day llama trek in the Apache-Sitgreaves
National Forest near Pinetop, Ariz. Or a day at the beach --
with the sand and a professional sand sculptor brought to
you.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Neiman Marcus, of course, is known for offering a few such
enticing -- and expensive -- gift ideas (along with more
traditional fare) in its Christmas catalog. But the llama and
beach offerings are two of dozens in a mail-order catalog
titled "A World of Special Experiences."
   The experiences catalog is the brainchild of Debra Keyes
Denniston, a Los Angeles lawyer-turned-entrepreneur, who
contends that gift recipients tire of "things they can
collect." She and her husband last year formed a company,
Experientia Ltd., to test the market for gifts not easily
tied up with a fancy bow.
   This year's 48-page catalog offers an array of ideas, from
around $10 to $27,500. The llama trip goes for $599 a person.
And the "anytime, anywhere" beach party is only $3,199. (That
includes the sand artist -- and a butler to provide a gourmet
picnic for two.)
   For the musical-theater lover on your list, underwrite a
show at the Goodspeed Opera House, East Haddam, Conn. -- for
$15,000. There are no takers yet for the most-expensive item:
underwriting a production by the Miami City Ballet. (Neiman
Marcus says its $5,898-a-person Mardi Gras trip isn't sold
out yet, either.)
   What's popular? "Anything to do with flying," says Ms.
Denniston, such as a hot-air-balloon ride ($132 a person).
Jerry R. Gossel, a Bozeman, Mont., real-estate appraiser,
ordered the sailplane ride for two -- for his ex-wife in
Washington, D.C. The out-of-the-ordinary gift, he says, "will
leave some very good memories."
   Ms. Denniston brokers each gift arrangement after a
customer has paid for it. She gets an undisclosed commission;
the recipient must schedule the experience. This year, she
says, customers are more cost-conscious than last year,
preferring moderately priced offerings. A $47 canoe trip for
two on Northern California's Russian River is moving well.
But orders like that don't generate hefty commissions.
Consequently, she says, "we haven't reached our projections
for this year."
   But she can relieve any frustrations during an $8,999
weekend -- helping a demolition team blow up a building.

   CSC Industries Inc. said it has more than doubled the
number of shares outstanding, resulting in $17.5 million of
new equity and a change in the ownership structure of the
company.
   The steelmaker, based in Warren, Ohio, said it sold 11.6
million newly issues common shares for $14.5 million. Of that
total, Daido Steel Co., a principal shareholder of CSC,
purchased 5,840,000 shares, and C. Itoh &amp; Co., Marubeni
Corp., and Okaya &amp; Co., each purchased 1,920,000 shares. CSC
generated an additional $3 million of equity by converting $3
million of debt with Imetal of Paris into 2.4 million new
common shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The transactions boosted the number of CSC's shares
outstanding to 22,744,915 from 8,744,915. It also boosts
Daido's ownership to 38.2% from 32.5% and ownership by each
of the three Japanese trading companies to 8.4%. Imetal's
ownership was reduced to 23% from 32.5%. The stake held by
remaining shareholders was reduced to 13.5% from 35%.
   The company said the additional equity would be used to
finance improvements at its 35-inch rolling mill complex and
its 12-inch bar mill.

   A company spokeswoman said the price increases are the

50 cents for daily copies of its national edition in the
Midwest and 60 cents in the Southwest.

   The price for the national edition in the Southeast was
raised to 75 cents last September, but the national edition
on the West Coast will remain at 50 cents. The daily paper
costs 50 cents in the Northeast, except in the tri-state area
near New York, where it is 40 cents.
   Major newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal, have
for the first time in years raised their daily price. Last
week, Times executives said they would study "pricing
strategies" for the New York Times, but no price increase was

   Denison Mines Ltd., facing a possible cash shortage next
month, said it was in discussions with two separate parties
interested in acquiring the uranium mining concern.
   William James, who was appointed president and chief
executive officer of Denison last week, said the talks were
at a "very preliminary" stage. Mr. James wouldn't identify
the potential buyers, but said the talks were continuing.

   "We'll talk to anybody {about acquiring Denison}. We need
the money. We're tight," he said.
   Mr. James said Denison, which has been plagued by low
uranium prices for several years, could still sell some of
its assets to raise cash. The company has been unable to sell
its overseas oil and gas assets since putting them up for
sale last year. Denison, based in Toronto, also has interests
in potash and coal mining.
   Denison must repay 150 million Canadian dollars (US$129.4
million) in bank loans next month. Mr. James said the company
is seeking an extension. Denison also faces a deadline next
March to retract C$175 million in preferred shares.
   On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Denison Class B, nonvoting
shares closed yesterday at 70 Canadian cents, up six Canadian
cents. The Class A shares gained five Canadian cents to 75
Canadian cents.

   Last month, the company's sole operating unit,
Metropolitan Circuits of California, sought bankruptcy-law
protection. Both petitions were filed in bankruptcy court in
Santa Ana. In recent months, the companies have tried to

   EC Stumbles on a Standard for HDTV

   Economics, Technology
   Throw Effort Into Disarray

   BRUSSELS -- The European Community's much-heralded attempt
to beam super-sharp television pictures to a new generation
of television sets is experiencing static interference.
   The plan for high-definition television, or HDTV, is aimed
at giving EC companies a head start on replacing the world's
650 million television sets with new, more expensive models
that would deliver movie-theater quality to the living room.
The 625 million-European-currency-unit ($860 million)
project, considered by some a model for public-private
cooperation, would show how EC companies could meet the
Japanese challenge.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But technology and economics have conspired to throw the
community's HDTV strategy into disarray. The confusion, many
consumer electronics experts believe, is likely to increase
HDTV development costs and lengthen the time required to
create a marketable new generation of television sets and
programs.
   "It will be another 10 years or so before the HDTV market
takes off," says Sjef Stoop, a researcher at the SOBE
research institute in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, which
specializes in consumer electronics. Dataquest Europe in
London also projects that sales of HDTV sets in Europe won't
begin to take off before the end of the decade.
   That could be more bad news for Europe's struggling
electronics giants N.V. Philips and Thomson S.A., which are
betting a big part of their future on HDTV.
   Before the most recent European troubles with HDTV,
electronics companies here were struggling to catch up with
Japan. Sony Corp. has had a working version of HDTV for five
years and has been selling professional HDTV equipment for
video film makers for more than two years. And last week,
Sony became the first company to sell $18,000 HDTV sets in
Japan.
   However, the Japanese standard is incompatible with the
planned European one and is said by technical experts to have
other disadvantages that could limit its world-wide
acceptability.
   While the EC industry had been making impressive progress
in its attempt to compete with the Japanese, that effort
received a setback last month linked to the merger between
two U.K.-based broadcasters, British Satellite Broadcasting
Ltd. and Sky Television. BSB was one of the few EC
broadcasters already using an early version of the European
standard, known as MAC (for multiplexed analog components),
which was to evolve into the European version of HDTV. Now
that BSB has merged with Sky, the new company, British Sky
Broadcasting, plans to drop BSB's experiment with MAC and to
connect the 120,000 BSB subscribers to the conventional
satellite broadcasting system now used by Sky.
   That means that a new potential market for MAC television
sets, which both Philips and Thomson were planning to launch
next year, has been lost. Both companies have invested
heavily in developing and marketing MAC receivers, though
neither will say how much, and they had been counting on a
growing EC market. The European Community in 1986 passed a
directive requiring all direct-broadcast satellites, such as
the one used by BSB, to use MAC broadcasting technology.
British Sky Broadcasting, the new company, will broadcast on
a satellite that escapes the jurisdiction of the 1986
directive.
   Both companies say they will go ahead as planned and
launch the $7,000 MAC TV sets, uncertain exactly when
programs will be available.
   Philips declines to discuss how the British merger affects
the prospects for HDTV, but the company last week announced
that it had filed a suit against BSB and Sky charging breach
of agreements involving the technology. Philips also declines
to discuss the effect of the loss of the British market for
MAC television sets.
   A spokeswoman for British Sky Broadcasting Ltd. declined
to comment on the Philips suit.
   But failure to ignite much consumer interest in its MAC
equipment and lack of a significant improvement in picture
quality are the reasons that BSB found itself unable to
continue as an independent company, according to officials of
the newly merged one. Even those who eventually do buy MAC
television sets will see very little difference, British Sky
Broadcasting officials said.
   Moroever, BSB had spent so much on technology that it was
unable to invest adequately on programming.
   "This market wants more TV programs, not more technology,"
says a spokeswoman for British Sky Broadcasting in London.
   But television marketing experts and broadcasting
companies argue that the blow to the MAC system in Britain is
just a taste of the market rejection it will experience in
other countries. If Europe's electronics companies continue
to pursue MAC, they could end up pouring money into another
bottomless technological pit, these critics say.
   "European companies still have every chance to succeed in
the HDTV market," says Jean-Luc Renaud, a senior consultant
at Logica Communications Ltd. in London. "But that requires
that they accept that the MAC system is dead and move quickly
to develop other alternatives."
   Other experts also say that the EC's standard for HDTV
stands little chance of winning acceptance outside Europe
unless it is further perfected. HDTV experts in the U.S.
Federal Communications Commission, for example, have refused
to adopt the European standard for U.S. broadcasts, arguing
that it has limitations.
   Instead, because of the limited availability of
broadcasting satellites, many U.S. researchers favor a
digital HDTV system that is delivered to homes on telephone
cables. If European companies want a chance at capturing more
than just the EC market, Mr. Renaud says, European
manufacturers need to cooperate with Japanese companies to
come up with a more flexible and more widely accepted world
standard.
   European MAC broadcasts can be received by a regular
television set by adding a decoder, costing around $400. MAC
televison sets would be sold for the limited number of
top-of-the-market consumers who wanted immediate improvements
in picture and sound quality. MAC television sets will appear
much like the final HDTV set, featuring a ratio of length to
height of 16 to 9, similar to that of movie theater screens.
   Once enough MAC broadcasts are launched, the HD-MAC
standard, creating full-fledged HDTV, would be introduced.
(At that point, consumers who wanted to receive the full
effect of the HDTV broadcasts would have to buy an HDTV set.
Without a new HDTV set, viewers wouldn't see improved
pictures.)
   This strategy initially was considered attractive because
it allowed a phased-in development of HDTV, much as color
broadcasting gradually replaced black and white. The
competing Japanese standard for HDTV wouldn't allow such
phased-in development.
   But even before the BSB-Sky merger, this EC strategy was
being undermined by fast-moving technology and entrepreneurs
who saw opportunities in bucking the system.
   First, Societe Europeene des Satellites, an innovative
Luxembourg-based company, launched Astra, a low-powered
satellite that found a legal way to escape the EC's 1986
directive. Astra now broadcasts 16 channels across Europe,
only two of which use the MAC system.
   Jonathan Drazin of Dataquest Europe says the demise of the
MAC system wouldn't necessarily be a major blow to HDTV in
Europe. He argues that going through the interim step could
even harm the prospects of HDTV in the long run. Consumers
who bought decoders to receive the MAC broadcasts might be
happy enough with that and not want to buy HDTV at all, he
says.
   Some analysts say the whole HDTV program needs to be
rethought, with more imput from broadcasters, program-makers,
consumers and private investors. "Let's hope that this time,
technologists and politicians will share the platform with
entrepreneurs and consumers," says Logica's Mr. Renaud.

   Federal Express Corp. reported a slight increase in
earnings for the second quarter ended Nov. 30, surprising
analysts who had expected a drop of as much as 25%.
   The Memphis, Tenn., express-delivery company reported net
income edged up 1.3% to $37.5 million, or 71 cents a share,
from $37 million, or 70 cents a share, in the year-earlier
period. Revenue rose 16% to $1.99 billion from $1.72 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earnings rose despite slower volume growth, continued
losses from its overseas operations, and a $73 million, or
54%, rise in fuel costs from last year.
   "The quarter was better than expected, but given the
economy and the very muddled outlook for petroleum prices,
they're not out of the woods yet," said David M. Guthrie,
analyst with Morgan, Keegan Inc. in Memphis.
   Indeed, after releasing earnings late yesterday afternoon,
FedEx reported that its average daily volume during November
was up a scant 3.8% from the year before. That growth rate
compares with 9% in October and 16% to 20% earlier this year.
   The company said cost cutting, including reduced overtime
and fewer part-time workers' hours, helped offset the
overseas losses and slower revenue growth. Salaries and
benefits dropped to $846 million from $861 million in the
first quarter.
   The results "reflect the concerted efforts of all of our
employees to improve productivity and reduce expenses in a
very difficult environment," said Frederick W. Smith, chief
executive officer.
   Federal Express also was helped by its participation in
the Operation Desert Shield buildup of military forces in the
Middle East, though the company wouldn't specify how much
that contributed to earnings. A spokesman said the charter
business added "at least" $10 million more to revenue than it
did last year.
   George V. Robertson, analyst with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc.
in Baltimore, said that by diverting four 747s to Desert
Shield, Federal Express likely gained efficiency in the rest
of its fleet, since the company had extra capacity.
   "If you get extra hours out of each plane, that's all to
the good, especially if the planes are flying full," he said.
   Also helping FedEx was a lower tax rate, which the
spokesman said resulted from the reorganization of the
company's international corporate structure. Second-quarter
profit before tax dropped to $76.6 million from $80.8 million
a year earlier.
   The company didn't quantify its international losses, but
Morgan Keegan's Mr. Guthrie said FedEx officials told
analysts that results didn't improve from a year ago.

acquisitions," said Herb Kelleher, Southwest's chairman. He
added that the company doesn't have any current plans to use
the credit.

   Asea Brown Boveri Inc. said a unit revised its agreement
to sell its Georgia Kaolin business to ECC Group PLC, after
discussions with the U.S. Justice Department.
   The Justice Department had been reviewing the agreement in
light of antitrust regulations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The revised agreement calls for the ABB unit to sell the
major part of the Georgia Kaolin business to ECC for about
$340 million, with ABB retaining one facility known as Dry
Branch. The Dry Branch facility will have a capacity to
produce 800,000 tons of kaolin a year. Its 1991 revenue is
estimated at about $80 million; ABB said profitability is
expected to increase when the plant is operated as an
independent unit. Kaolin is used as a coating and filler in
producing high quality paper.
   As reported, the initial purchase price last May was about
$520 million for the entire Georgia Kaolin business. ABB
acquired the Georgia Kaolin business when it acquired
Combustion Engineering Inc. about one year ago. Georgia
Kaolin had 1989 revenue of $170 million.
   Asea Brown Boveri, Stamford, Conn., is part of ABB Group,
Zurich, the world's largest electrical engineering concern
with annual sales of about $25 billion. Asea Brown Boveri's
products and services include those for the power, process,
industrial automation and environmental control markets. It
has about $6 billion in sales in the U.S.
   ECC Group, Cornwall, England, is a producer of white
pigments with annual sales of about $1.6 billion.

   Nalco, a Naperville, Ill., specialty chemical maker, now

Canada and Catoleum in Australia. The ventures, which have
total annual sales of about $185 million, make specialty

   A Nalco spokesman said the agreement fits its strategy of
international growth. The spokesman said one-third of Nalco's
1989 sales of $1.07 billion came from abroad, and that the

of the decade.
   The transaction, subject to regulatory approval, is
expected to close in the first quarter of 1991.

   Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs has sold his entire
position, approximately 930,000 shares or 14.6% of the common
stock, in CML Group Inc., a direct marketer of consumer
products.
   Mr. Jacobs, who abandoned his bid to take over the company
in April, said he sold his stake before year end for tax
purposes, according to a statement issued by CML. The
purchaser, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., then resold the
stock to retail and institutional customers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "For CML, it takes care of two concerns," said Mark
Perlgut, a spokesman for CML. "Many investors have stayed
away from the stock because they were unsure about what Irwin
Jacobs would do with his shares and some were concerned about
what it would do to the Acton, Mass., company's liquidity if
Mr. Jacobs had to unload the stock in a large block at a low
price."
   Sources involved in the transaction said Mr. Jacobs sold
the stock for approximately the average price of his
purchases over the past year, about $18 dollars a share. Mr.
Jacobs representatives would not comment on the sale.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, CML shares closed at $18.375, down $62.5 cents.

   NEW YORK -- For anyone starting to feel good about banks
-- good enough, perhaps, to invest in them -- even a modest
decline in the banks' profits from consumer lending would be
a jolt.
   And such a decline appears increasingly likely. Although
nobody expects to see big write-offs such as those being
generated on the real estate and leveraged buy-out fronts,
there are growing signs that consumer lending -- thus far the
one bright area in bank portfolios -- is weakening.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Credit card losses and delinquencies are up. Charge-offs
for bad personal and auto loans are up. And as the country's
economy sours, the leverage of individual households is at
its highest point in decades.
   "If you think about the 1980s, the two biggest profit
centers were real estate and consumer banking," says Charles
Peabody, bank analyst at Kidder Peabody. "In real estate,
banks went from being profitable to often losing a lot. In
consumer banking, they will still earn money, but I think
they will earn less." He argues that loan growth will slow --
or perhaps even turn negative -- and loan losses will rise,
doubly affecting bank profits.
   Although consumer lending "won't exactly retrace the
footsteps of real estate" and LBO lending, Mr. Peabody writes
in a recent report, consumer loans will -- far from bailing
out troubled banks -- "likely compound their woes."
   The report, chillingly titled "The Next Wave? Focus on
Consumer Credit," specifically urges investors to steer clear
of Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Barnett Banks and Valley
National (Arizona). But its broader message applies to the
many banks that, having been burned on real estate, are
counting on the consumer to bail them out.
   In past recessions, consumers who lost jobs or income
reduced their level of borrowings, and analysts expect this
to happen next year as well. "It's inevitable," says Charles
Clough, chief strategist with Merrill Lynch. "Consumers are
slowing their borrowing."
   He says that credit cards -- the most expensive form of
debt -- are also the fastest growing line of consumer credit.
Since people don't borrow at high rates except when forced by
circumstances, Mr. Clough says consumers are distressed.
"People are borrowing to pay interest. They are up against
the wall," he says.
   As of June 30, the total of non-credit-card personal loans
outstanding with banks was $278 billion -- up only a meager
1.5% from a year earlier, according to Veribanc, a Wakefield,
Mass., bank rating firm. At the time those figures were
compiled, the word recession was barely being mentioned in
polite company. Now that employment is turning down, will
consumer debt be far behind?
   Consumers may well retrench more than in past downturns,
because their level of leverage is higher. Kidder say
consumer interest payments are 8.2% of after-tax income,
steady for several years but up significantly from the level
during past recessions.
   And loan losses are already rising. In the year ended June
30, according to Veribanc, banks charged off 3.19% of credit
card loans, up from 3.02% in the previous year. For other
personal loans (not including mortgages), charge-offs were
0.93%, up from 0.75%. And yesterday, Moody's Investors
Service reported a big rise in both charge-offs and
delinquencies for the credit card obligations that serve as
the backing for rated credit card securities.
   Banks say they expect consumer-lending profits to continue
rising, but their tone is cautious. John Lucking, chief
economist at Valley National, says, "Clearly, in any sort of
downturn consumer debt is more at risk. There is room for
some marginal growth {in 1991}; I'm not expecting phenomenal
growth."
   Citicorp says growth rates "are clearly slowing." The bank
won't forecast profits, but an official says the bank's
geographic diversity and superior systems for "tracking"
credit card debt should keep charge-offs in hand. The company
offered some of the same defenses last year, when analysts
began to question its exposure to commercial real estate.
Barnett also says growth is slowing, but it adds that its
older, affluent consumers in Florida are relatively good
credits. It says consumer profits should keep rising.
   David Cornell, chief financial officer for Chase's credit
card and related operations, says he has yet to see any
evidence of reduced consumer borrowing. But, he adds, "we are
seeing some increase in delinquencies and charge-off rates in
a number of East Coast states. I don't know how deep that
trend will go." Chase also expects consumer profits to
continue upward.
   The extent to which consumer loans go bad, says
Prudential-Bache analyst George Salem, will depend on the
credit culture of individual banks. "What degree of care went
into approving loans? To what extent were bankers seeking
market share at the expense of being prudent?"
   On that score, the evidence is grim -- especially in
credit card and in auto loans, probably the two biggest
potential trouble spots. (Mortgage loans are considered the
safest form of personal credit.)
   Since the end of the previous recession, Kidder says
credit card debt grew at an annual 17% rate -- and such debt
held by banks grew at a 19% clip. However, the personal
after-tax income available to service that debt grew at only
a 7% rate, Kidder says.
   Moreover, new accounts proliferated. At Chase, for
instance, close to one third of all credit card accounts were
established within the past two years. The bank has no record
of how those accounts will fare in tough times, although so
far, Mr. Cornell says, those accounts are performing as
expected.
   Car loans are suspect because the terms of such loans have
grown, and because banks have increasingly bought bundles of
such loans from dealers. These so-called indirect loans tend
to produce higher loss rates than loans generated by banks.
   If a changing credit culture at banks made credit more
accessible, the culture of consumers has also changed.
Personal bankruptcies are rising, analysts say, partly
because consumers seem to be losing their fear of making such
filings.
   "We're seeing some spikes in bankruptcies in some areas,"
says Thomas P. Johnson, Barnett's chief executive officer of
retail banking. "I'm concerned about it; there seems to be a
cultural shift."
   Even Newsweek recently counseled readers who lost their
jobs to "make no payments on postponable bills, including
credit card bills, if doing so means that you'll run out of
money within a few months." Lest its readers worry, the
magazine added, "Forget about hurting your credit rating;
it's repairable."
   Not exactly music to a banker's ears.

   Stocks Close Mixed After Dropping

   NEW YORK -- The stock market ended little changed, having
recovered from an opening drop on news of Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's sudden resignation.
   Mr. Shevardnadze quit amid growing domestic turmoil in the
Soviet Union, warning that the country was slipping toward
dictatorship.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   European markets tumbled on the news, and the stock market
here opened on a sharp downdraft. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average plummeted 26 points before stabilizing and then
climbing back to positive territory by noon.
   The average ended with a 2.73-point gain at 2629.46.
   "They keep driving the market down but it snaps right
back," said Richard Eakle, president of Eakle Associates.
   While the Shevardnadze news darkened the political
backdrop, traders say the market recovered as implacable
portfolio managers continued their year-end buying.
   "A lot of people are doing a little dressing up today,"
said Edward J. Shopkorn, director of equity trading at Mabon
Nugent. Mr. Shopkorn said the money managers were putting
excess cash to work by buying highly liquid large-capitalized
stocks such as International Business Machines, which in turn
helped send the industrial average higher. IBM rose 1 to 113
3/4.
   The broader market remained fractionally lower, however.
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index eased 0.08 to 330.12 and
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slipped 0.03 to
180.32.
   Decliners led advancers, 813 to 726, with 507 stocks
ending unchanged. Volume totaled 174,700,000 shares, compared
with 180.4 million Wednesday.
   Dudley A. Eppel, senior vice president of equity trading
at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said trading volume should
jump today as monthly futures contracts and options expire.
Otherwise, said Mr. Eppel, the market should continue to
drift as the end of the year approaches.
   Aside from mounting war worries over the Middle East, Mr.
Eakle of Eakle Associates said the stock market has some
things working in its favor that mitigate the downside risk
in share prices.
   "Oil is still headed south, as are interest rates, and
there is a perception that inflation is receding," he said.
   Crude oil for February delivery fell 54 cents yesterday to
$26.39 a barrel.
   Mr. Eakle also said that the internal dynamics of the
stock market are showing signs of strength. Trading volume is
increasing on days that the market rises, he said, while the
number of stocks that hit new lows each day is decreasing.
   Some banking shares rallied again. The group has been
strong since the Federal Reserve Board cut the discount rate
to 6.5% from 7% on Tuesday.
   Manufacturers Hanover jumped 1 5/8 to 24 1/8 on heavy
volume that included some dividend-related trading.
Manufacturers said on Tuesday that it would pay its regular
82-cent dividend to stock of record Jan. 2.
   Citicorp gained 1/2 to 13 3/4, BankAmerica rose 1 3/8 to
28, J.P. Morgan added 7/8 to 46, and Bankers Trust rose 5/8
to 45 1/4.
   First Chicago, whose First National Bank of Chicago unit
cut its prime lending rate by 50 basis points to 9.5%, closed
unchanged at 18 1/2.
   Chase Manhattan was left behind, however. The stock fell
3/8 to 10 3/4.
   Travelers finished up 1/8 to 17 1/8 on volume of almost
two million shares. Property/casualty insurer Continental
Corp. has acquired at least 3% to 3.5% of Travelers' stock,
according to USA Today. A 634,500-share block, representing
about 0.6% of Travelers' outstanding shares, changed hands
shortly after noon.
   Sprague Technologies added 3/8 to 3 7/8. The company said
it completed the sale of its semiconductor group to Sanken
Electric for $58 million in cash. Sprague said the sale will
result in a charge of about $49 million in the fourth
quarter. Proceeds will be used to repay bank borrowings and
free up capital for further investment.
   Symbol Technologies added 7/8 to 12 1/4. NCR decided to
withdraw from the market a hand-held laser scanner that
Symbol claimed infringed on its patents. Symbol said it
dismissed its pending patent-infringement suit against NCR.
   Convex Computer rose 7/8 to 11 5/8. The company said it
installed one of its supercomputers at the University of
Houston.
   Urcarco fell 3/4 to 3 7/8. Merrill Lynch downgraded its
rating on the stock Wednesday and cut earnings estimates for
the company.
   Rollins Environmental Services added 5/8 to 9 3/8. First
Boston is recommending that its clients buy the stock.
Rollins says maintenance at its Deer Park, Texas, incinerator
has been completed and the facility became operational
Wednesday.
   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. dropped 7/8 to 7 1/2. An
article in yesterday's New York Times highlighted the
company's efforts to reschedule a mountain of short-term
debt. A number of small banks are refusing to go along,
raising fears a settlement could be weeks, even months, away,
the Times said.
   L.A. Gear closed unchanged at 15. The company said late
Wednesday that it completed a $360 million credit facility
arranged by Bank of America as agent for itself and a
syndicate of domestic and international banks.
   Hunt Manufacturing added 1 5/8 to 12 1/4. The company
boosted its quarterly dividend to eight cents a share from
7.75 cents.
   Coca-Cola Enterprises added 1/4 to 15 3/8. The company
said its board approved a program to buy back as many as 15
million common shares. The company said, however, that it
doesn't expect to buy back any shares under the program until
the second or third quarter of 1991.
   The American Stock Exchange Index fell 0.16 to 306.49.

   Shaw Brothers (Hong Kong) Ltd. said net income for the six
months ended Sept. 30 tumbled 27% to 54 million Hong Kong
dollars (US$6.9 million) from HK$74 million a year earlier.
   For the period, the film and property group controlled by
Sir Run Run Shaw had a write-down of HK$34 million on its
investment in Hong Kong Cable Communications Ltd., the local
cable-TV franchise that was abandoned last month by its five
partners.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Excluding the write-down, the company said profit climbed
19% to HK$88 million. Earnings per share dropped to 13.62
Hong Kong cents a share from 18.46 Hong Kong cents a share,
while revenue grew 8.7% to HK$100 million from HK$92 million.
   Group directors proposed an interim dividend of seven
cents a share, unchanged from a year earlier.
   Shaw Brothers attributed the growth in operating profit to
an increased contribution from its Singapore property arm,
following the renovation of a commercial building it owns
there.

   CHICAGO -- Grain and soybean prices sank on worries that
the surprise resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze might slow trade between Moscow and the U.S.
   The resignation might complicate top-level discussions
about how Moscow will use the $1 billion in food credit
guarantees granted by the Bush administration earlier this
month, traders said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the soybean
contract for January delivery sank 5.5 cents a bushel to
settle at $5.7075 a bushel. The price of the corn contract
for December delivery slipped 1.25 cents a bushel to settle
at $2.4975 a bushel.
   U.S. grain officials had expected the Soviet Union to
quickly use the guarantees to arrange bank credit to purchase
as much as 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat, as well as
quantities of soybeans and corn. However, snags were
developing before Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation.
   Earlier this week, the U.S. government reportedly balked
at a request by Moscow to use part of the U.S.-backed credit
to pay for the expense of shipping the U.S. foodstuffs to
Soviet ports. The U.S. government apparently wants Moscow to
use the credit solely to buy U.S. goods.
   "The resignation casts a further pall on the outlook for
any quick shipments to the Soviet Union," said Robert
Lekberg, an analyst at Farmers Grain &amp; Livestock Corp.,
Chicago. "We don't know who is in charge."
   Soybean prices also were depressed by reports that the
Soviet Union bought a large amount of soybean meal from South
American sources instead of the U.S.
   The U.S. credit guarantees were granted in part because
credit problems had prompted the Soviet Union to slash its
purchases of U.S. crops, which in turn had depressed the
prices received by U.S. farmers for corn, wheat and soybeans.
   Some U.S. traders are speculating that prices of corn and
soybean futures contracts will approach their
life-of-contract lows unless U.S. exports increase soon.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Petroleum futures trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange was extremely thin in a session traders
termed "dead." Market players seemed more focused on holiday
parties than on the Persian Gulf crisis that has dominated
oil market news in recent months. Generally, prices fell with
the only exception being the two nearest months of heating
oil futures contracts. Spurred by forecasts of harsh weather
encroaching upon the northeastern U.S., January heating oil
prices rose 1.04 cents a gallon to settle at 78.88 cents. The
Northeast, the nation's principal heating oil market, has
seen unseasonably warm weather so far this winter. And some
traders doubt that the Northeast will see quite as severe a
cold wave as some of the rest of the country has. Still,
dropping temperatures forced analysts and others to take note
of the supply picture for heating oil, which reflects the
halting of certain exports from Saudi Arabia. In crude,
February contracts lost 54 cents a barrel to end the day at
$26.39.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices were strong, with the March
contract trading as high as $1.1130 a pound. It ended at
$1.1005, up 1.15 cents a pound. The March contract traded at
a low of $1.0550 on Dec. 7, but has since been locked in a
range between $1.06 and $1.09, noted Richard Hirsch, metals
trader for Sharps Pixley Inc., New York metals brokers. The
fact that the contract rose above $1.10, a key resistance
level, and retained the gain yesterday indicates that the
copper market is strong, despite the continued buildup of
copper supplies, Mr. Hirsch said. One factor that enabled the
market to rise sharply was that traders who had previously
sold short had to buy contracts to cover their positions as
prices rose, he said.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed, with silver
strong, gold easier and platinum slightly higher. March
delivery silver ended with a gain of $10.30 cents an ounce at
$4.2630, after rising as high as $4.40 (an intraday gain of
24 cents) in early trading. February gold was off $1.30 an
ounce at $386.70. April platinum ended with a gain of $2 an
ounce at $423.90, but was well off its high for the day of
$429. The thinness of the pre-holiday market contributed to
silver's strong advance, analysts said. The advance also was
accelerated as the March contract rose through several key
resistance levels until it reached its high of the day, they
said. The fact that it fell back so sharply from its best
level indicated that it was mostly a technical market, one
analyst said. Continued uncertainty in the Persian Gulf was
also a price-firming factor, according to analysts. The
resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
should have had more impact on platinum than on silver
because the Soviet Union is the world's second-largest
producer of platinum, and any internal unrest could affect
that nation's output, one analyst said.

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices shot up on concern about a
forecast of a cold front moving into California's citrus
producing areas. The January contract ended with a gain of
9.95 cents a pound at $1.20, just under its intraday high of
$1.2005. Wayne Barnes, a meteorologist at Weather Services
Corp., in Bedford, Mass., said an Arctic cold wave that
brought heavy snow to Seattle late Tuesday was moving down
into California. Frost advisories have been issued for
Southern California, including the citrus-growing areas, and
temperatures are expected to drop into the 20s tonight,
tomorrow night and Sunday night. The coldest readings, in the
mid-20s, are expected tomorrow night and Sunday night, Mr.
Barnes said. The anticipated cold wave is apparently evoking
memories of the devastating freeze that hit Florida around
this time last year and severely damaged the citrus crop
there, analysts said. But the California orange crop is minor
compared with Florida's, and the amount of oranges processed
for juice is even significantly smaller, said Merrill Lynch
analyst Judith Ganes. California is expected to produce only
about 20 million gallons of juice, while Florida's output is
expected to amount to 236 million gallons, Ms. Ganes said.
She also noted that minor damage to the California crop could
be more significant for the market than major damage that
made some oranges unsuitable for picking and hauling. If only
cosmetic damage occurred, she said, it could result in more
oranges than normal going into processing for juice, adding
an unexpected increase in the total orange juice supply.

   Pan Am's Talks
   With TWA Seek
   Special Financing

   Pan Am Corp. appears to be intensifying its efforts to
receive needed financing.
   It is talking to Trans World Airlines about a special type
of financing that is usually arranged only for bankruptcy
court proceedings, people familiar with the talks said. The
special terms are said to provide for so-called
"debtor-in-possession" backing by TWA.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This type of financing is arranged for a company that is
seeking reorganization. It normally becomes effective after
the filing of a petition for bankruptcy, subject to
bankruptcy court approval. The lender gets priority liens on
unencumbered assets of the company and typically gets paid
back before other creditors.
   Asked whether the company is seeking such a type of
financing, a Pan Am spokesman said, "we are not commenting on
any such speculation." Mark Buckstein, general counsel at
TWA, said, "While we've had discussions with Pan Am, it's
premature to comment further on those discussions."
   Pan Am's board is said to have discussed filing for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection during a morning
meeting this past Wednesday. Thus far, Pan Am has confirmed
only that its board met and that it discussed the TWA
proposal, as well as developments in the $400 million sale of
Pan Am's London operations and other assets to UAL Corp.'s
United Airlines.
   Pan Am is said also to be asking United to extend it some
financing, but the larger carrier is skittish about giving
the struggling line any money for fear it will be at risk if
Pan Am ceases operations.
   People familiar with Pan Am agreed the airline desperately
needs cash to cover daily costs and other debts. Like the
rest of the industry, Pan Am is being pinched by high jet
fuel costs, the company's second-largest expense behind
labor.
   It has outstanding bills to Airbus Industrie, the European
aircraft consortium; United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp;
Whitney engine-making unit and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp., a government agency that insures pension plans.
   The TWA talks pertain to a merger proposal TWA owner Carl
Icahn sent Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett this past Sunday.
Mr. Icahn proposed buying Pan Am's 150 million shares
outstanding for $1.50 a share in cash and $1 a share in
preferred stock or notes. That amounts to $225 million in
cash and $100 million, at the most, in subordinated notes.
The offer is slated to expire today, though Mr. Icahn may
extend it.
   Pan Am executives are said to have told Mr. Icahn that Pan
Am needed some sort of bridge loan as part of any merger
proposal. A bridge loan is a type of short-term financing
that borrowers repay after they get a longer-term loan or
cash from the sale of assets.

   Donaldson Seeks
   To Make Big Board
   More International

   NEW YORK -- William H. Donaldson, chairman-designate of
the New York Stock Exchange, wants to greatly expand the
number of foreign stocks trading on the Big Board to make it
"pre-eminent on the international stage."
   Mr. Donaldson's program, sketched out in an interview
yesterday, marks a new era for the exchange and the U.S.
securities markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For years, the Big Board has been content with being home
to the stocks of the biggest U.S. companies. But with the
rapid internationalization of investing, Mr. Donaldson
forsees a new role for the Big Board. He wants to capitalize
on the exchange's powerful franchise as a central,
well-regulated market and make shares of top companies around
the world easily available to U.S. investors.
   Mr. Donaldson, who takes office Jan. 1., indicated that he
will tackle the major issue that has impeded the trading of
large numbers of foreign stocks on the Big Board -- the fact
that most big foreign corporations don't meet stringent U.S.
financial disclosure and accounting rules.
   "We have to work with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Congress and try and get some some rules here
that will allow the listing of these securities," Mr.
Donaldson said.
   The Big Board currently lists about 100 foreign stocks for
trading, many in the form of American depositary receipts, or
ADRs, which represent an interest in shares that are kept in
the custody of a foreign bank.
   But many of the biggest foreign corporations, like
Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank AG, cannot trade on
major U.S. exchanges.
   "There's a lot more international investing by U.S.
citizens," Mr. Donaldson said. "I think the challenge is {for
the Big Board} to maintain and become the premier exchange in
the world. You are going to see U.S. portfolios more evenly
divided between U.S., European and Far East securities. I
hope to move in that direction in terms of listings.
   "We can't do that overnight," Mr. Donaldson added. "There
are rules and regulations against it. But that's on the top
of the agenda."
   Mr. Donaldson appears to be trying to head off
developments that some traders say could gradually erode the
Big Board's status as one of the few major world stock
exchanges. Some traders point to the success of the London
stock exchange's Seaq International system, a lightly
regulated, computerized market that now accounts for about
40% of the volume in many major European stocks.
   Mr. Donaldson said he remains committed to the Big Board's
auction-style market, where buyers meet sellers on the floor
of the exchange. "I believe the best market is the auction
market," he said, criticizing the lack of order and price
disclosure in off-exchange markets.
   Mr. Donaldson, the 59-year-old co-founder of Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, will succeed John J. Phelan Jr. as
chairman of the nation's largest stock exchange. He indicated
that he will count on a staff that will be given larger
responsibilities, on the exchange's power as a regulator, and
on his years of contacts with the top professionals in the
securities industry.
   In his first years at his own firm, DLJ, Mr. Donaldson's
signature phrases were, "Let's sleep on it," and "Let's wear
the white hat," recalls co-founder Richard Jenrette, now
chairman of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.,
the big insurer which bought DLJ in 1984 for $423 million.
"He's not likely to preside over the status quo," Mr.
Jenrette says, but "he's not a hip shooter. Deep down, he's a
pretty conservative person."
   Indeed, at a time when a lot of foreign investing is
taking place through bets on derivative securities -- such as
the popular put warrants based on the Nikkei index of 225
Japanese stocks -- Mr. Donaldson indicated that he would
rather see investors gain overseas access on Big Board by
buying actual shares of companies.
   Still, he would like to see the exchange cautiously
embrace derivative securities, recognizing them as
legitimate, but possibly risky, hedging and investment
vehicles.
   "The way to make money is to select companies that are
doing things and growing," he said. "Short-term orientation
is counter-productive to that. . . . We have to go slow on
some of these {derivative} instruments. I don't mean to
condemn derivatives, I just want to make sure people who have
manufactured derivatives have assessed the risk."
   Mr. Phelan is stepping down as Big Board chairman after an
influential 19-year tenure as an exchange policymaker,
including 5 1/2 years as chairman. He guided the exchange
through a turbulent decade, which included the 1987
stock-market crash, the disappearance of several securities
firms and the rapid growth in stock trading.
   Initially, Mr. Donaldson's toughest job will be mediating
between the warring interests that have battled over
commission rates, trading rules and regulations for years.
   Another high priority will be stemming the exchange's loss
of market share. Through November, the Big Board handled
66.3% of all trades in its own stocks, and 82.3% of total
shares traded.

   Stocks Edge Up After an Early Decline
   Blamed on Shevardnadze Resignation

   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks rose despite the
uncertainty of Soviet politics to post yet another gain.
   The advance represented a reversal from a rapid morning
fall. Traders took stock prices sharply lower in the first
hour on worries about how the resignation of Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze would affect international
relations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The resignation of the widely respected minister cast
additional concern into a world searching for new order while
the communist empire dismantles and new allies assemble to
oppose Iraq.
   The Nasdaq composite index was more than 2 points lower as
the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26 points at the
opening. But before that upset could translate into a broad
retreat, buyers came into the market and slowly took prices
higher.
   When the day was done, the Nasdaq composite index gained
1.08 points, or 0.29%, to close at 372.30. The New York Stock
Exchange composite index was down just 0.03 point to 180.32.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2.73 points to close
at 2629.46.
   Opposite forces had their turn with the market yesterday.
Traders looking for a correction took the market lower while
institutions looking to upgrade their portfolios brought it
back up.
   "Traders are generally looking for a little correction on
the downside. It doesn't seem to be happening," said Ron
Catalano, executive vice president for trading at Prescott
Ball &amp; Turben.
   The Shevardnadze news prompted those anticipating a
correction to mark down prices.
   "We're at the high end of a trading range, and everybody's
a little gun shy," Mr. Catalano said.
   Lower prices, however, enticed many institutions looking
to improve their portfolios before year end to start buying,
said Ralph Costanza, head of OTC trading at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham.
   Mr. Constanza said the institutions confined their
shopping primarily to larger issues. Among the institutional
targets were Apple Computer, up 2 1/8 to 44, and Intel, up 1
1/4 to 39.
   In the broader market, advancers edged out decliners, 967
to 943. National Market System volume was active at 131.9
million shares, well ahead of Wednesday's 114 million.
   Apple Computer's 5% rise continues a recent trend. Apple
shares have climbed almost 18 points in the past two months.
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons gave the stock another endorsement,
upgrading its rating to "strong buy" on the strength of good
demand for Apple products.
   Interim Systems was the most active stock. H&amp;R Block began
a previously announced $1.66-a-share, or $45 million, tender
offer for Interim Systems. Trading more than four million
shares, Interim was up 1/16 to 1 5/8.
   Office Depot agreed to acquire Office Club in a stock
swap. The proposed transaction provides for each Office Club
share to be exchanged for 1.194 shares of Office Depot.
Office Club shares were 4 5/8 higher to 18 1/8. Office Depot
fell 3/4 to 16.
   Among other office supply retailers, BizMart was up 5/8 to
8 1/8 while Staples added 3/4 to 18.
   First Florida Banks tumbled 2 points to 9 1/4 after the
company projected a 1990 loss of $8 million compared with
earnings of more than $39 million for 1989. The bank's
management also will recommend suspension of the
first-quarter dividend.
   Topps was up 1 to 16 3/4. The stock gave up some ground
after reaching a new high at 17 1/4 earlier in the day.
Shares in the baseball card distributor have been strong
since the company reported favorable fiscal third-quarter
earnings on Monday.
   SciMed Life Systems climbed 3/4 to 29 as investors awaited
fiscal third-quarter earnings. After the close, SciMed said
net income improved to 50 cents a share from 37 cents a share
a year ago.
   MCI Communications was up 1/4 to 19 5/8. MCI and British
Telecom are soliciting bids for construction of an undersea
fiber optic cable linking Europe and North America.
   Quantum slipped 1 point to 18 1/8. This newspaper reported
Wednesday that seven Quantum insiders, including the
company's chairman and its chief financial officer, have been
reducing their stakes in Quantum.
   Midlantic lost 7/8 to 5 1/4 after the bank holding company
decided to omit its regular dividend of 25 cents a share.
Although it expects to show a profit for the quarter,
Midlantic said the dividend omission reflects expectations
for continued weakness in the local and national economies.
   Spiegel dropped 7/8 to 13 7/8. After the market close
Wednesday, Spiegel said customers are responding to
promotions but are putting more pressure than expected on
holiday sales margins.
   National Health Laboratories fell 1 3/8 to 11 3/8 on heavy
volume. The company acknowledged Wednesday that its pricing
policies have been the subject of inquiries by a federal
grand jury. National Health Labs said its policies conform
with relevant laws and regulations.
   Sunrise Technology added 3/4 to 6 1/2 bid, 6 3/4 asked.
The company said the Food and Drug Administration has given
it approval to market its glaucoma treatment.

fiscal third-quarter net income on a 22% drop in revenue.
   Net income in the quarter, ended Nov. 30, was $2.1
million, or 22 cents a share, down from $2.8 million, or 29
cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue fell to
$22.8 million from $29.3 million.

Revenue rose 4% to $83.1 million from $79.9 million.
   The brokerage company blamed the decline on lower
commission and interest income, because of investor caution
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Quick &amp;

   Short Interest

   NEW YORK -- Short interest was about flat on the New York
Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange, as more short
sellers apparently covered their positions and more investors
relaxed.
   The figure for the Big Board for the month ended Dec. 14
edged higher from the mid-November period and totaled nearly
1% of the total shares listed on the exchange. The Amex
figure was fractionally lower and totaled about 0.8% of all
Amex-listed shares. Until this last trading month, short
interest had increased almost relentlessly, up 54% from a
year ago.

   "The loss of momentum is very interesting. Lots of shorts
must have covered," said Jack Solomon, technical analyst at
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. But he also thinks a "growing
complacency" among investors about the recent rally from the
market's low point could set them up for another market
retreat. Short positions then could take off again, he said.
   But Mr. Solomon also echoed the prevalent view about short
interest. "Everyone's agreed that we'll slough it off"
because it has lost its significance as a market indicator.
The growth of derivative products such as options and
warrants, and arbitrage, have acted as hedges on short
positions. Previously, short interest was a clearer
barometer, but with the offsetting effect of other
stock-related products, "you can't tell easily where the
smart money is," Mr. Solomon said.
   Citicorp continued with the highest individual short
volume, more than 17.1 million shares. In the previous
trading month, ended Nov. 15, its short interest shot up from
next to nothing as investors and analysts anticipated further
problems for the New York banking giant, including a cut in
the dividend. This week, Citicorp announced such a cut and
significant staff reduction.
   First Chicago Corp., another major banking company, saw
short interest soar to 12.8 million shares from only 565,651
the month before. Analysts had speculated that it also would
cut its dividend. Last month, however, it declared its
regularly quarterly dividend.
   Again following Citicorp on the Big Board list were the
Indianapolis drug company Eli Lilly &amp; Co., at 14.3 million
shares; the Stamford, Conn., telecommunications concern GTE
Corp., 13.5 million, and the Toronto holding company Varity
Corp., 12.8 million. They have been among short interest
leaders for some time.
   New York exchange short interest rose at the Dec. 14
settlement date to a record 855,767,642 shares from the
previous record 850,807,721 at mid-November. On the Amex,
short interest fell to 83,229,058 shares from an adjusted
83,535,467 shares, which was a record. The month included the
22 trading days through Dec. 7.
   At mid-December 1989, short volume was 555,872,159 shares
on the Big Board, indicating a 54% advance over 12 months,
and an adjusted 58,785,285 shares on the Amex, indicating a
41.6% rise.
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet been
purchased for return to lenders.
   Although a substantial short position reflects heavy
speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors
consider an increase in short interest bullish because the
borrowed shares eventually must be bought back.
   Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may
be caused partly by arbitraging. The figures occasionally
include incomplete transactions in restricted stock.
   The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board
short interest ratio rose to 5.58 from mid-November's 5.42.
The ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange's
average daily trading volume that would be required to
convert the total short interest position. Average daily New
York exchange volume for the 22 trading days was 153,286,778
shares. Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio also
has weakened in value as an indicator because of hedging
strategies.
   Among bellwether issues, the Pittsburgh industrial giant
Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s short interest rose about 58%
to five million shares; Johnson &amp; Johnson, the New Brunswick,
N.J., health-care company, saw its short volume rise about
36% to nearly three million shares; and at the Armonk, N.Y.,
computer company International Business Machines Corp., the
total rose 17% to 5.5 million. NWNL Cos., a Minneapolis life
insurance concern, had short interest of nearly 2.2 million
shares; it had none the month before.

   World Bond Prices Fall on News of Resignation
   Of Shevardnadze, Hint of More Soviet Turmoil

   NEW YORK -- Perceptions of growing political turmoil in
the Soviet Union roiled international bond markets yesterday,
hammering prices and boosting yields.
   Early yesterday, Eduard Shevardnadze resigned his position
as Soviet Foreign Minister and warned that "dictatorship was
coming" to the Soviet Union. His departure is seen creating
more problems for Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The hint of anarchy is very unnerving to the bond
market," said David McClean, a proprietary trader at Credit
Lyonnais Securities USA, a unit of the big French bank.
   Erick Muller, bond market economist at Credit Commercial
de France, said the Shevardnadze resignation brought the
Soviet Union's problems to the forefront and "showed
{investors} what a big problem the U.S.S.R. can become."
   Analysts worry that should the Soviet Union disintegrate
into chaos, others countries in Europe -- especially Germany
-- could be faced with a flood of refugees. To finance the
potentially enormous cost of absorbing the refugees, along
with other costs associated with helping to stabilize the
Soviet Union, European governments will be forced to borrow
enormous amounts of money in the credit markets. Such
borrowing, in turn, would put upward pressure on European
interest rates.
   Even before the Shevardnadze resignation hit the news
wires, bond market sentiment in Europe was bearish due to
speculation that the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, may
soon raise interest rates another notch in an effort to wring
out inflation. In turn, that could force other European
countries, such as France, to raise rates also.
   Klaus Baader, a bond market analyst with UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew in London, said that while political uncertainty in the
Soviet Union "is bad news for bonds all around" the world,
it's particularly bad for Germany because German banks have
lent the Soviet Union billions of marks, all of which are
guaranteed by the Bonn government. The latest loan, for 1.2
billion marks ($811.9 million), was signed Tuesday.
   In addition, trade with the Soviet Union remains important
for industries in eastern Germany. "If you take away that
last bit of demand for eastern German industry, it's going to
make the adjustment process that much more difficult."
   In trading yesterday, bonds issued by Germany and France
were hardest hit of the major government bond markets,
followed by Britain and the U.S.
   Germany's benchmark 10-year government bond, or bund, fell
nearly one point to a price of 100.3 to yield 8.83%. France's
8.5% 10-year bond also fell nearly a point to 91.32 to yield
9.99% while the 8.5% 30-year bond fell 1 7/8 points to 85.65
to yield 10.04%.
   In Britain, the benchmark 11.75% gilt due 2003/2007 was
quoted at 106 27/32, down 26/32 from late Wednesday to yield
10.72%.
   Meanwhile, First Chicago Corp. said its First National
Bank of Chicago subsidiary lowered its prime, or base lending
rate, to 9.5% from 10%. American National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of
Chicago, also a First Chicago unit, was the only other bank
to follow suit. On Wednesday, several regional banks lowered
the prime rate, although no major money center bank has yet
done so.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of U.S. Treasury securities followed the European
markets yesterday, posting modest losses on news of Mr.
Shevardnadze's resignation.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 5/8 point
lower, a decline of $6.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, rose to 8.23% from 8.17% on
Wednesday.
   Rates on Treasury bills were modestly lower. The discount
rate on three-month bills ended at 6.55% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 6.73%, down from Wednesday when the
discount rate ended at 6.59% to yield 6.77%.
   Yesterday's loss followed even sharper declines on
Wednesday, when investors sold bonds in an effort to capture
profits as the year end approaches.
   But trading activity has been light because many investors
have moved to the sidelines, where they will remain until the
new year begins.
   Market players "want no risk, and any political turmoil
that may take place outside or even in the domestic market
will have a magnified impact," said Maria Ramirez, who heads
Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc.
   Recent declines in interest rates and news of political
strife in the Middle East and Soviet Union has prompted
investors to "assume the opportunity to take profits, to lock
in profits before they totally evaporate," said Ms. Ramirez.
At this juncture, "there's no reason to take risk."
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Most investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1/4 point
lower. In the junk bond market, prices of speculative-grade
bonds, or securities with low credit ratings or no credit
ratings at all, finished little changed.
   There were no new issues.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Securities
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended steady to 1/4 point lower.
   In ratings action, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. placed the
triple-B rating of the Philadelphia International Airport's
airport revenue bonds on its Credit-Watch surveillance list
with negative implications.
   According to S&amp;P, the action reflects "the city's
inability to access the note market," and possible
repercussions relating to the airport's capital funds.
   The bonds are rated B-a by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   A total of $154 million of outstanding debt is affected by
the action. Philadelphia traders report that the bonds were
unaffected by the news and continue to trade at yields in the
9% range, similar to those of the city's general obligation
bonds.
   In secondary trading, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 were 1/4 lower at 98 7/8 to yield
7.27%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities ended with losses of 6/32 to 8/32.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
January delivery were down 8/32 at 99 5/32. Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. Mac Gold 9% securities and Federal National
Mortgage Association 9% securities were down 6/32 at 98 29/32
and 98 21/32, respectively.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the government-sponsored
thrift bailout organization, sold approximately $750 million
of mortgage securities.
   According to one Freddie Mac trader, the issues were very
well received.
   In the primary market, no new issues were announced.

   The Office of Thrift Supervision permanently banned Yerkes

from serving any thrift, thrift-holding company or subsidiary
that is federally regulated.
   Under a consent order in connection with the firm's audit
of First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Independence,
the thrift office charged that the 1988 and 1989 audits
weren't conducted by qualified public accountants. The thrift
office also said that Yerkes &amp; Michels reported the true
financial condition of First Federal, which meets all capital
requirements, but that it relied on government examiners'
paperwork, and didn't independently review the thrift.
</LP>

   Yerkes &amp; Michels couldn't be reached for comment. Under
the consent order, the firm neither admits nor denies the
grounds of the order.
   The thrift office also issued a cease-and-desist order
requiring Yerkes &amp; Michels to correct its auditing practices,
and repay audit fees of $51,000 that the firm charged First
Federal. It must also establish minimum credentials for any
partners and staff assigned to bank or credit union audits.

   Black &amp; Decker Corp. said it agreed to sell its North
American Mallory Controls business for $90 million but
expects to report fourth-quarter earnings lower than
previously estimated.
   The Towson, Md., power-tool maker said it sold Mallory
Controls, which it acquired as part of last year's
acquisition of Emhart Corp., to Emerson Electric Co. It said
the Brazilian portion of the business is being offered for
sale separately.

   Emerson Electric, a St. Louis-based maker of electronic
products, couldn't be reached for comment.
   Black &amp; Decker has been selling assets in order to meet
payments on the $2.8 billion loan it used to buy Emhart. Last
month it sold its U.S. and Canadian assets in True Temper
Hardware as well as capital stock in True Temper Ltd. in
Ireland to Huffy Corp. for $55 million.
   The company also said it expects lower earnings due to
lower sales in the U.S. and deteriorating business conditions
in Brazil. "While we expect to offset most of the
sluggishness in the U.S. through aggressive cost-containment
programs, the difficulties in Brazil will result in
lower-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter," said
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Nolan D. Archibald.
However, he also noted that the company expects a profitable
fourth quarter compared with the net loss it reported last
year.
   Mr. Archibald said the company is actively pursuing the
sale of the Brazilian Mallory Controls business and will
implement major cost reductions in all Brazil operations.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Black
&amp; Decker shares closed down 25 cents to $10.75.

tar sands in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt.
   New Brunswick Power, owned by New Brunswick province,
signed a multimillion-dollar contract with Bitor America
Corp., a unit of state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, to
purchase as much as 16,000 barrels a day of liquid bitumen
for 20 years. The utility will use the fuel, which has the

   New Brunswick Power said it will spend 338 million
Canadian dollars (US$291.6 million) over the next four years

a new smokestack scrubber to reduce emissions produced from
burning the bitumen, which has a high sulfur content.
Orimulsion is a mixture of water and extra-heavy bitumen, a
tarlike crude. Like conventional crude, Orimulsion can be
shipped by tanker or pipeline, but costs less than half the
price.

   Bank of New England Tentatively Sets
   Debt-for-Equity Swap With Bondholders

BUYBACKS, REDEMPTIONS, SWAP OFFERS (BBK)

<LP>
   BOSTON -- Bondholders of Bank of New England Corp.
tentatively agreed to a debt-for-equity swap that would give
them 92% of the company's common stock and give the bank
breathing room in its effort to survive.
   By reducing bank's debt payments, the swap of $706 million
in debentures for almost all newly issued stock would ease a
squeeze on the bank's cash while it struggles to recover from
bad real estate loans that have resulted in steep losses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The swap is a necessary but not sufficient condition for
survival," said Don Kauth, an analyst with First Albany Corp.
"The added capital would certainly buy them some time, maybe
three or four quarters of time."
   Even with a successful swap, "the bank needs economic
growth in the region so it can begin booking good loans and
grow out of its problems, just like Bank of America did a few
years ago," says Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker,
Anthony and R.L. Day in Portland, Maine. "Of course, the New
England economy might not turn up for another year. The
bank's destiny is, at this point, not within their control."
   BNE has some 69,545,000 common shares outstanding now. In
composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange,
BNE common closed at $1.125, up 12.5 cents.
   The tentative agreement, following months of negotiations,
was reached by committees representing bondholders and must
still be approved by the Bank of New England's directors,
according to people familiar with the negotiations. The
bank's shareholders -- whose stake would be severely diluted
-- also must approve the swap. In addition, at least 90% of
the bonds must be tendered for the swap to proceed.
   Bondholders had initially hoped to get a combination of
cash and stock for their bonds, but the bank is cash-starved
and according to bank officials, regulators have directed the
bank to apply cash gleaned from recent asset sales to other
needs.
   Bank of New England's current capital cushion is a thin
$255 million, or 1.1% of its total assets of $23 billion. The
swap, if it moves forward, will save the bank about $60
million a year in interest payments and boost its capital to
nearly 3%, a level regulators mandated the bank reach by last
spring. Healthy banks have capital levels of 6% or more.
   The arrangement would split the bank's 92% ownership
almost evenly between holders of $181 million of senior debt
and holders of $525 million of subordinated debt. Under the
plan, bondholders also would receive another $100 million in
newly issued debt; the new bonds won't pay interest but are
eventually redeemable for cash or stock in five years.
Committees representing bondholders want new bonds issued so
that they will have some contractual claims on assets if the
bank fails or is purchased; debt holders' claims take
priority to stockholders in cases of bankruptcies or
failures. Bank officials declined to comment.
   The bank is currently burdened by $2.84 billion in
nonperforming assets -- mostly commercial real estate loans
-- that have been rising steadily through 1990 as the New
England economy continues to slump. The carrying costs of
such bad assets, estimated at $250 million annually, are
largely responsible for the bank losing $203 million in the
first nine months of this year.
   If the swap were to fail because not enough bondholders
participate, most analysts agree that the bank would be
unable to survive for long.

   It's a question that home buyers and homeowners alike are
wondering about in these perilous economic times: What's
happening to house prices: Or, to put the question in
slightly didfferent form: How much house does $250,000 buy
these days in various parts of the country?
   Regional variations are still very large, but they may be
dwindling slightly. All through the 1970s and 1980s, housing
prices on the East Coast and in California far outstripped
the national averages. Today the trend is beginning to
reverse. Prices are holding up better in the heartland.
Following are reports from six communities, which generally
support the idea of slowly converging prices:

   SEATTLE:
   Roller-Coaster Prices
                                                                                                       

   Seattle real estate has had a roller-coaster ride over the
past couple of years. Prices skyrocketed in the late 1980s,
but have recently begun falling back to earth.
   "The Seattle area is a fascinating market because things
are happening so fast, it's like a decade being crammed into
two years," says Jim Hebert, the president of Hebert Research
Inc., a research firm in Bellevue, Wash.
   Redmond, Wash., is an eastside suburban Seattle community
of about 33,000 that is typical of the way prices have risen
and fallen. Real-estate agents point to one house, on the
market for $244,000. But over the past year, agents say, the
value of such a house has gone from $225,000 to $280,000 and
back down again to the current level.
   It is a 3,060-square-foot two-year-old eight-room house
with four bedrooms, a terrace deck, a kitchen with European
cabinets, digital appliances and a walk-in pantry. It has a
three-car garage, a formal dining room, 2 1/2 baths, a family
room with a fireplace, gas heat and a spacious lawn.
   Over the past several years, rapid population growth,
particularly from equity-rich Californians, and job growth in
the business sector fueled real-estate speculation in the
Seattle suburbs that inflated most homes well beyond their
sustainable value, according to Barbara McElveny, the second
vice president of the Seattle King County Association of
Realtors.
   "When the market rose 37% in 1989, people jumped on the
bandwagon to take advantage of the appreciation," says Mrs.
McElveny.
   The price fall is particularly evident at the high end,
because there was more speculation in that market segment.
For example, Mrs. McElveny says a Realtor she knows just
purchased a waterfront home on Lake Washington in an
exclusive neighborhood. It sold for $900,000, but the listed
price for the home was $1.4 million, she says.
   On the east side, $250,000 will buy much more than it did
eight months ago. Typically, it will get you, at minimum, a
three-bedroom home, she says. At the low end, there is still
a shortage of housing in the under-$200,000 price range, but
if the buyer psychology continues to worsen, houses may come
available for first-time buyers.
   "The housing market just turned a somersault from the
first quarter and continued to decline throughout the year,"
says Mr. Hebert of the research firm.
   Mr. Hebert says the suburban Seattle housing market will
decline as much as 20% between now and the late spring before
leveling out and starting to reflect "normal" real-estate
prices in the area.

   NAPERVILLE, ILL.:
   Slow but Steady
                                                                                                       

   In Naperville, Ill., a distant suburb of Chicago, prices
have held fairly steady over the past year, although the
market is beginning to feel a glut of higher-end houses. Here
in Naperville, a $250,000 house is at the upper end of the
housing spectrum.
   A typical $250,000 house would be a four-bedroom, 2
1/2-bath, 3,000-square-foot Georgian or colonial home on a
quarter-acre lot in an upscale subdivision. It would almost
certainly have a master bedroom suite including a bath with a
whirlpool and seperate shower; brick fireplace, central air
conditioning, first-floor den and family room, large kitchen
with custom cabinets and ceramic-tile floors, a full basement
and a three-car garage.
   Prices for this type of home are about unchanged from late
1989. In Du Page County, where Naperville is located, prices
for all detached, single-family houses are up 3.23% -- less
than the rate of inflation -- compared with annual price
increases of about 5% to 13% from 1984 through 1988,
according to the Du Page Association of Realtors.
   "We're far better off here in the Midwest than the rest of
the nation," says Richard Gardner, a Realtor with ERA Dupreef
Realty in Naperville. "The rate of {market} growth has slowed
down a little, but there's no decrease in value here."
   One reason is that the market was relatively stable during
the 1980s real-estate boom, with price rises of about 40%
versus 100% in, say, New Jersey.
   Lately, however, traffic at the high end has slowed. It
takes 60 to 90 days to sell a house now, compared with 50 to
60 days a year earlier. Upper- and middle-management layoffs
and a slowdown in employee transfers at corporate offices in
the area have thrust more houses in the $250,000-and-up range
onto the market. (Naperville, which locals call "the fastest
growing noncoastal community in the U.S.," is home to dozens
of major corporate offices, including an AT&amp;T regional center
with more than 8,000 employees.)
   "In our office, we have noticed a lot of upper-end homes
starting to sell," says Dan Shanahan, branch manager at
Coldwell Banker's Naperville office. "But this is not a
disaster. It's nowhere near a disaster."
   The slowdown has pinched builders of more expensive homes,
particularly those that sold houses contingent on the sale of
the buyers current residence. Prices have fallen on builders'
models and custom-built homes in some subdivisions. Two
Naperville homes sold in a real-estate auction last month
were sharply reduced from their original listing-price. A
builder's model priced at $699,000 sold for $485,000, and a
home listed at $395,000 went for $295,000.

   RIDGEWOOD, N.J.:
   After the Free Fall
                                                                                                       

   Housing prices in this largely white-collar commuter town
have fallen about 30% in the last three years, but real
estate agents say they should stabilize this year.
   "We've almost leveled off," says William Gilsenan Jr.,
owner of Gilsenan Co., a local real-estate firm. "With
interest rates coming down, we should see greater activity
this year."
   At the moment, bargains abound in Ridgewood, a quiet town
of 25,000 located 12 miles outside New York City. "Basically
for $250,000 you get a nice little house on a nice little
lot. Nothing fancy," says Catherine Sperte, a representative
of Century 21. That's in marked contrast to a couple of years
ago, when anyone with less than $300,000 to spend was told to
look somewhere else.
   While it will hardly buy a mansion, $250,000 clearly goes
a lot further in Ridgewood today than a year ago. Then,
sellers were still determined to hold out for the fat profits
that rolled in during the boom market of the 1980s. More
often than not, they found their homes sitting on the market
for months.
   Generally, real estate brokers say $250,000 will now buy a
colonial-style house with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a
one-car garage, on a 50-foot-by-130 foot lot. Cape style or
split-level homes, considered somewhat less desirable,
generally offer more house (say an additional bedroom or
bathroom) for the same money.
   In a typical example, one colonial style, stone frame
house with four bedrooms and 2 1/2 bathrooms went on the
market last August for just under $300,000. Months passed and
there were no serious nibbles, so the sellers recently
slashed the asking price to $249,000. Although the house
hasn't sold yet, real-estate agents say that now that the
price is more realistic it should go fairly quickly. "Houses
that are priced right sell well," says Arlene Dodd, a sales
representative with Schlott Realtors in Ridgewood.
   To a great extent, Ridgewood's housing market mirrors the
fortunes of New York City, particularly Wall Street. Soaring
for most of the 1980s, housing prices started tumbling after
the stock market crash of 1987, falling by some estimates at
a rate of 1% per month.
   Brokers here like to argue that since the area took its
lumps earlier than the rest of the country, the worst is
over. Despite their relatively upbeat tone now, there are no
guarantees that the Ridgewood market has bottomed, especially
given the uncertain economic situation.
   Already, prices have fallen enough to encourage first-time
buyers, who once couldn't dream of house-hunting in
Ridgewood. In fact, most of the recent activity has been in
houses costing under $300,000, while more expensive homes
languish on the market.

   ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:
   Slightly Cheaper
                                                                                                       

   Home buyers looking for a $250,000 home in the Orange
County region of Southern California will find that their
money buys them more this year --  although not a huge amount
more.
   "It looks like people are getting better deals in 1990
compared with 1989. In terms of square footage, they're
getting more house for the money," says Martin C. Dee,
spokesman for TRW Real Estate Information Services in
Anaheim, Calif.
   A TRW survey of homes sold in Orange County in October
shows more houses in the larger 1,500- to 2,000-square-foot
category than a year ago. Likewise, prices have dropped. The
average sale price of a home in October was $236,421, a 9.1%
drop from the year-earlier $260,180.
   "Part of what we're telling owners is that if you don't
have to sell, don't." The market just isn't good. It's that
simple," says Realtor Pat Neal of Copper Penny Real Estate in
Garden Grove, Calif.
   Still, the softness is a matter of perception. In the
tree-lined Garden Park tract of Garden Grove, about 30 miles
south of Los Angeles, $250,000 will get you a 26-year-old
California ranch style home with four bedrooms and 1 3/4
baths. Total square footage is a smallish 1,450. A year ago,
that same home would have cost just $10,000 more.
   "In the higher price ranges, we've seen more of a drop in
price because of the slower market, but it hasn't affected
home in the $250,000 range that much," says Marnie O'Brien,
senior marketing consultant for Grubb &amp; Ellis in Irvine,
where prices in that range have only dropped about 2% to 5%.
In Irvine, $250,000 will buy a five-year-old home with three
bedrooms and 1,500 square feet.
   What has changed more is the amount of time properties
spend on the market. The selling time for a $250,000 home in
Irvine is around 60 days now, half that of a year ago. In
Garden Grove, Ms. Neal says, the average time on the market
has been as high as 122 days. Overall, the housing market is
slowing in Orange County: from July to September, 1,712 units
were sold, compared with 2,037 in the second quarter, a 16%
in the second quarter, a 16% drop, according to Meyers Group
real-estate consultants in Corona, Calif.
   The biggest markdowns have occurred in homes priced over
$300,000. "You start seeing the sticker spread as you move up
in price. That's where you have the real softness and the
longer times to sell," says Ms. Neal. At the other end of the
spectrum, many more houses are listed below $200,000 these
days -- hardly enough to buy much more than a condo a year
ago.
   Tentatively, most Realtors say they expect flat to
slightly higher prices this time next year.

   HOUSTON:
   Recovery at Last
                                                                                                       

   In Houston, a quarter of a million dollars practically
buys a mansion. The Woodlands is a large new community 27
miles north of downtown Houston, a favorite of managers in
high-technology and energy companies. The landscape is
heavily wooded, and the money goes a lot farther here than in
New York or California.
   A typical $250,000 house has about 3,200 to 3,800 square
feet, four bedrooms, 3 1/2 baths and at least a two-car
garage. Quarter-acre lots are common. A few of the houses
have swimming pools, and the majority have a Jacuzzi tub as
standard equipment in the master bedroom. The house probably
will have two fireplaces.
   The two-story dwelling will likely have a family room or
game room and a den or study downstairs.
   Although prices have been rising lately, the gains have
been slow. The building excesses of the 1980s were so large
that it will still take years to work off inventory.
   "Our problem was that we simply built too much, we had an
oversupply of real estate," says Barton Smith, professor of
economics at the University of Houston. He adds, however,
that "in the past three years the economy has accelerated the
pace of the real-estate recovery."
   In Houston the housing market is probably balanced now,
although if there is any slant, it's on the side of the
seller.
   "This is a fairly balanced market, although demand is so
good that it's turning into a seller's market," David M.
Weekley of Weekley Homes Inc., a Texas homebuilder, says.
   "In Houston you have about seven years' worth of people
that have been held captive in a current house, but the value
is returning now," he adds. About 10% of the estimated 800
homes Mr. Weekley has built this year have been in the
$250,000 range, with an average price tag of aobut $300,000.
His company has been building homes in the city since 1976.
   During its worst times, the Houston real-estate market
depended heavily upon corporate transferees that could pretty
much be counted on, even as economic and market conditions
worsened.
   "It's still a good transferee buyer market," the
37-year-old Mr. Weekley says, "but people are able to move
now. There is a greater demand for move-up homes."
   John A. Daugherty, who estimates that his John Daugherty
Realtors has sold about 1,000 houses this year, about 250 of
which were in the $250,000 range, thinks that the market is
more balanced today than it has been in 20 years.
   There isn't an oversupply or undersupply, but an adequate
supply of housing, Mr Daugherty says.

   GWINNETT COUNTY, GA.:
   A Buyer's Market
                                                                                                       

   In Gwinnett Conty, Ga., the home buyer is king. Shoppers
are finding lower prices, a huge inventory of properties, and
willing -- even desperate -- sellers.
   In the Atlanta suburb, which in the late 1980s was among
the fastest-growing counties in the nation, $250,000 will buy
a large and well-appointed new two-story all-brick home with
four large bedrooms and as many baths on a half-acre to a
full-acre wooded lot with lots of extras. In that price
range, most homes feature a Jacuzzi bath, an outsized deck,
and sprinkler and security systems. Vaulted ceilings and
stained glass are popular, as are open floor plans and lots
of light.
   Buyers in Gwinnett hold all the cards. And they know it.
Overbuilding has left the area with a glut of unsold new
properties. Buyers are demanding -- and getting -- lowered
sales prices, extras such as high-priced appliances,
customized draperies, hardwood floors and favorable
financing.
   Closings on homes in Gwinnett fell 21.6% in the three
months ended Nov. 30 to 791 homes from 1,009 homes in the
same period of 1989, according to data from Metropolitan
Multi-List Inc. in Atlanta. While homes in Gwinnett fetched
97.2% of the asking price during the 1989 period, they
brought only 95.7% of it for the 1990 period. "They're
cutting the prices this year and selling fewer homes," says
John Hanes, a broker at Century 21 in Lilburn in Gwinnett.
   Ida Shelton, an agent with Sports Realty Inc., remembers
the glory days of 1986, when homes in Gwinnett were selling
as fast as they could be built. "We were sitting back taking
orders. We had more than we could cope with. People would ask
us to take a house in trade, and we'd laugh. We were
arrogant. You're seeing humble now."
   Chances are buyers will be able to get at least as much
home next December as they can now. Agents who used to stress
the virtual guarantee of appreciation now market homes more
for their comforts, the pride of ownership and the tax
write-offs.
   "It's something to enjoy. And there are tax advantages,"
says Mr. Ballard. "I don't see any appreciation for two or
three years."
   Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting
Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta, says anecdotal
information suggests land prices in Gwinnett have tumbled
"15% to 20% in the past year" and housing prices have
declined "5% to 10%" in the same period. "It's still falling.
Nobody sees firmness yet," he adds.
   "We'll still see a glut developing until the end of next
year," says Mr. Ratajczak, who predicts housing prices will
stabilize in 1992 and start to rebound in 1993.

   Among luxury items this season, champagne may prove to be
the holiday's biggest bargain. While people have begun to
balk at $40,000-$50,000 for a BMW, $10,000 for a Swiss watch
or $3,500 for a case of 1988 La Tache red burgundy, prestige
champagnes like Dom Perignon, Krug, Taittinger Comte de
Champagnes and Bollinger R.D. go for well under $1,000 a
case. These champagnes, in fact, appear to be less affected
by recession quivers in some parts of the country.
   "These wines are insulated," said Larry Shapiro of
Marty's, a leading chain of wine shops in Dallas. "Our
biggest dollar volume by far is Dom Perignon $90, and we
still can't get as much Roederer Cristal $100 as we can
sell."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Los Angeles, truckloads of Dom Perignon and Dom
Perignon Rose are sold to the Japanese. "I have Japanese
customers who buy 50 cases of Dom Rose and Cristal Rose at a
time," said Steve Wallace of Wally's on Westwood in Los
Angeles, noting that they're the most expensive he sells
($175 and $250 a bottle, respectively). "They ship it to
Japan, where it sells for $400 or $500 a bottle."
   California has the Japanese; Texas, having suffered
recession longer than the rest of the country, is on the
rebound and feeling celebratory. Other parts of the country,
however, are seeing a shift away from the prestige blends to
vintage and non-vintage champagne. "This is the first year we
didn't use up our allocations of Dom Perignon and Cristal,"
said Johnson Ho, owner of Knightsbridge Wine Shoppe in
Deerfield, Ill., a North Shore suburb of Chicago. Part of it
has to do with the disappearance of lavish holiday parties
given by investment bankers and brokerage houses in previous
years. "They've pulled back a lot," said Mr. Ho, "but
champagne still has the quality image and continues to be a
big gift item."
   Ninety percent of champagne sales are non-vintage brut or
extra dry (brut is actually drier than extra dry). The
personality of an individual brand, or "house style," is most
pronounced in the non-vintage blend that makes up 75% to 85%
of each shipper's production. Some are light and fruity, like
Perrier-Jouet, Lanson or Taittinger; others are deeper,
drier, more classicly structured, such as Bollinger, Pommery
or Veuve Clicquot.
   The popularity of individual brands fluctuates widely
around the country. Perrier-Jouet has high visibility on the
East Coast, perhaps because its importer, Seagram Chateau &amp;
Estates, is headquartered in New York, but it is not a hot
item in the west, where champagnes like Pol Roger,
Billecart-Salmon Rose and, lately, Veuve Clicquot have proved
more popular. Moet et Chandon has long been the leader in
Texas and much of the South with its White Star Extra Dry,
but several markets report plummeting demand since Moet
changed the style (it's fruitier and sweeter), upped the
price and dropped the term extra dry from the label. "People
just don't feel it's the same product," said Mr. Shapiro.
   The champagne that is gaining ground in virtually every
market, however, is Veuve Clicquot, in top restaurants around
the country as well as in leading wine shops. "Clicquot has
really hit California big in the past two years," said Mr.
Wallace. "It's one of our hottest items this year, that and
Billecart-Salmon." In San Francisco, where Pol Roger and
Bollinger were especially strong in previous years, Veuve
Clicquot has jumped in front. "It's really stolen their
thunder," reports Wilfred Wong of Ashbury Market. "Veuve
Clicquot at $25 a bottle outsells Pol Roger at $18.99 two to
one."
   Most of the country's top restaurants stock it; they have
to, they claim, because their customers ask for it. "In the
past year Veuve Clicquot has become our bestselling champagne
by far," says Faith Stewart Gordon, owner of the Russian Tea
Room in New York, where champagne and vodka are top choices
with the restaurant's caviar and smoked salmon.
   How does a single brand become the sudden favorite?
   "It's more than just cachet," said Mr. Wong. "It's known
as a quality product, very consistent in style, which is
fairly rich. But that bright orange label has helped make it
immediately identifiable. I recently brought Veuve Clicquot
to a tailgate dinner before a 49ers game and people eight or
10 cars away called out, `How's the Clicquot?' "
   Veuve Clicquot has always been a major player among the
leading houses of Champagne, especially popular in Europe but
less so in the U.S. until recently. Prior to the mid-'80s the
brand sold roughly 10,000 cases a year in the U.S. Today the
number is 60,000. At a time when most other brands are off 2%
to 8% from last year, Clicquot sales are up 15% this year,
according to Mireille Guiliano, executive vice president and
chief operating officer for Clicquot Inc. in America. Ms.
Guiliano, formerly with the Champagne Information Bureau, a
promotional organization in New York, always felt that Veuve
Clicquot was underrated in the U.S. and had the most
potential because of the company's commitment to quality.
Since 1984 hers has been the guiding hand behind Clicquot's
steady gains.
   "We took the long road and built the brand slowly over
seven years," said Ms. Guiliano. "Not everyone is willing to
do that, or can afford to." It doesn't hurt, of course, when
bottles with the familiar pumpkin labels flash across movie
screens in the hands of glamourous women like Michele
Pfeiffer ("The Fabulous Baker Boys"), or that its praises are
sung in the wine-bibber's cult film "Babette's Feast." You'll
catch a glimpse of it as well in "Godfather III," because
it's Francis Ford Coppola's favorite champagne.
   Still, every wave must crest. Champagne producers expect a
sharp drop in sales in early 1991 when prices for all
champagne will increase 20% to 30%, reflecting the weak
dollar and higher prices for grapes in Champagne. That will
boost the price for non-vintage brut to $30 a bottle or more,
but Ms. Guiliano is more sanguine than most. "We still have
so many untapped markets," she said, "and Japan is our next
baby."

   Adelaide Steamship announced in November a plan to cut
debt by A$3 billion and restructure. It had been criticized
by analysts for its complex holdings among associate
companies and said it would eliminate the cross-ownership.
   Bob Cumberlidge, managing director of Petersville Sleigh,
said the sale price reflects current market value and gives
the company A$1.5 million in net proceeds that will be used
to reduce debt.

   With Violating Patent

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Intel Corp. said it sued Cyrix
Corp. in a Texas federal court, charging that the small Texas
chip maker violated an Intel patent in a chip that mimics a
popular Intel computer chip.
   Intel said its suit, filed in U.S. District Court in
Dallas, charges that a Cyrix "co-processor" chip duplicates
the function of a patent that Intel has held since 1982.
Co-processor chips are used in personal computers to speed up
certain calculations, and work together with the computer's
main microprocessor, or "brain," chip.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cyrix's chip mimics Intel's 80387 co-processor, which is
designed to work alongside Intel's popular 80386
microprocessor. Intel said it filed the suit after it failed
to reach agreement with Cyrix after several months of
negotiations over the disputed chip. Intel said its suit
requests unspecified damages and an injunction to prevent
Cyrix from continued infringement.
   Cyrix President Jerry Rogers said that Cyrix is
"absolutely not" infringing on the Intel patent and that the
Intel suit is probably a reaction to suits filed by Cyrix.
Cyrix, based in Richardson, Texas, last week filed antitrust
lawsuits against Intel in federal and state courts in Texas,
Mr. Rogers said, charging that Intel "has been trying to keep
us out of the market and hinder our business" by intimidating
Cyrix's suppliers and customers, among other things.
   Intel's suit illustrates the tough time chip makers have
in developing components that clone popular established chips
without sparking legal challenges. Intel has a separate suit
pending against Advanced Micro Devices Inc., whose
co-processor chip Intel claims violates Intel copyrights.
Intel has a history of suing companies that try to clone its
chips.

   CMS Charge
   Of $450 Million

   DEARBORN, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp. said it will take a
charge of about $450 million against fourth-quarter earnings
and post a loss for the year because of a regulatory ruling
yesterday affecting a failed nuclear power plant.
   Analysts said the charge had been expected, in light of
actions by the Michigan Public Service Commission. In the
first nine months of 1990, CMS earned $145 million, or $1.78
a share. In 1989, net income was $312 million, or $3.80 a
share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
CMS jumped $1.75 to closed at $27 a share.
   CMS announced the charge after an administrative law judge
for Michigan's Public Service Commission proposed yesterday
that CMS Energy be allowed to recoup $1.34 billion of the
$2.14 billion it hasn't recovered from its abandoned nuclear
plant in Midland, Mich. CMS had asked for rate increases that
would allow it to recover the full $2.14 billion.
   The judge's recommendation won't become final until the
full commission issues a final order, which is expected in
the latter half of next year. But CMS opted to take a charge
now, based on the judge's recommendation.
   CMS's Consumer's Power Co. utility abandoned its effort to
build the Midland nuclear plant in 1984 after spending $4.1
billion. The ruling relates to the amount CMS hasn't
recovered after converting part of the plant to a gas-fired
cogeneration facility.
   The recommended recovery would occur over a 10-year period
and would provide the company an annual electric rate
increase of $111.5 million during that time.
   CMS is still in litigation over the amount it may recover
through electric rates for the costs of the cogeneration
facility that began operation in March.

   New York Area
   Lost 100,000 Jobs
   In 1990, Data Say

   NEW YORK -- The New York-northeastern New Jersey area lost
some 100,000 private sector jobs in 1990, and the employment
outlook is expected to remain bleak in 1991, the U.S.
Department of Labor's Middle Atlantic Regional office said.
   Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of labor
statistics for the U.S. Department of Labor, said "1990 is
the year the slowdown turned into a substantial downturn." He
added, "We're not seeing any let up in 1991."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a year-end review of labor market conditions in the
23-county area, labor officials said that job losses in key
industries such as manufacturing, construction, finance and
insurance accelerated in 1990, with New York City,
particularly Manhattan, suffering the worst blows.
   Once a major source of employment for the area,
manufacturing jobs are now quickly disappearing. Some 50,000
manufacturing jobs were cut in the first 10 months of this
year, a faster rate than the average decline of 30,000 a year
in the 1980s. Since 1979, the region has lost 360,000
manufacturing jobs.
   The construction industry also took a serious hit as jobs
declined by 37,000 during the first 10 months of 1990, after
dropping by 8,000 in 1989 and 4,000 in 1988. The 50,000-plus
jobs lost in the last three years reversed a substantial rise
of 130,000 construction jobs from 1979 to 1987.
   Mr. Ehrenhalt traced the beginning of the decline to the
October 1987 stock market crash. Since then, the financial
services industry has been forced to undergo a major
restructuring. According to the bureau of labor's statistics,
the securities industry declined by 10,000 jobs in 1990.
Since the peak in late 1987, Wall Street alone has lost some
29,000 jobs. That was after it added 93,000 jobs in the prior
10 years. Another 10,000 jobs were cut this year in banking
and nondeposit credit institutions.
   While much of the job growth during the 1980s took place
in the service sector, the rate of growth of those jobs
slowed significantly in the past year, Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
Service jobs rose by 55,000 in 1990, but the increase falls
short of the 60,000 to 75,000 yearly gains posted during the
1980s.
   Mr. Ehrenhalt noted, however, that the loss of jobs hasn't
resulted in significantly higher unemployment rates. The
region's unemployment rate averaged 5.3% in the first 10
months of this year, close to the national average of 5.4%.
In part, that's because there has been a reduction in the
growth of the labor force, or simply, there are fewer people
in the area looking for work. Mr. Ehrenhalt said another
factor might be that in difficult economic times, women and
other minorities are discouraged from applying for jobs.
   For those who do work in the area, wages aren't rising as
fast as they used to. Payroll earnings in the region rose
3.4% in 1989, lower than the national increase of 5.7% and
far below the 9.3% rise the previous year.
   While the report mostly contained dismal news on the job
situation, the one mildly bright spot was the slowing of
inflation. Consumer prices in the region rose 6.2% for the
10-month period ending in October, only slightly higher than
the 5.8% rate in 1989. A big jump in energy prices accounted
for most of the increases. Excluding energy, consumer prices
actually declined 0.3% to 5.4% this year, reflecting lower
housing costs.
   Even so, the prospects for 1991 don't look good. Given the
weakness in the national economy and recently announced job
slashing at major New York banks, the region's job market
isn't likely to come back anytime soon. "The growth engines
have run out of steam," says Mr. Ehrenhalt. "This is going to
be a tough year for the regional economy."

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it will begin a
special program to buy back shares of its Class H common
stock from GM executives who receive them as part of their
compensation.
   About 4,800 GM employees own approximately 2.7 million
Class H shares that are eligible for the one-year program. GM
Class H shares represent a dividend interest in GM's GM
Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary. That unit contains the
defense operations of Hughes Aircraft Co. and the automotive
electronics operations of Delco Electronics Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A GM spokesman said the company will buy the Class H
shares back at market prices, beginning in January. GM Class
H shares closed yesterday at $18.75, up 25 cents in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   GM said the program will benefit employees by providing a
ready buyer for the thinly traded Class H shares. The program
also will help GM meet a goal of buying back 10 million Class
H shares. That repurchase was supposed to be finished by the
end of this year, but GM is still about 5.4 million shares
short of the target.
   Approximately 88 million Class H shares are outstanding,
but about 65 million of those are held by the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute, which sold Hughes Aircraft to GM in 1985
in return for cash and Class H stock then valued at $5.2
billion.
   In 1989, GM and the Hughes Institute agreed to a complex
restructuring of the original purchase. As part of that
restructuring, GM paid the Institute an additional $975
million in cash and notes, and received 35 million Class H
shares from the Institute. GM agreed to buy back the bulk of
the Institute's remaining Class H shares by 1995 at $30 a
share. GM also got the option to repurchase still more Class
H shares from the Institute at $35 a share, even if the
market price is higher.

   USX Corp. Accepts
   Fine of $3.3 Million
   To End OSHA Case

   WASHINGTON -- USX Corp. agreed to pay fines of $3.3
million to settle charges of workplace health and safety
violations at its Fairless Hills, Pa., steel mill and its
Clairton, Pa., coke works.
   The settlement was the largest in the history of the Labor
Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
far exceeding the $1.6 million that Chrysler Corp. agreed to
pay in April 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the USX amount was scaled down sharply from the $7.3
million in fines OSHA had proposed in November 1989. Besides
agreeing to the fines, USX pledged to end violations related
to hearing-impairment, electricity, communications with
workers about hazards, crane operation, and recordkeeping at
the Fairless and Clairton facilities. The company also agreed
to undertake corporatewide programs for abating those health
and safety hazards.
   USX agreed to the settlement without admitting guilt as to
the allegations.
   "There are other provisions of this settlement agreement
far more important to worker safety and health than the
penalties," said Gerard Scannell, assistant secretary of
labor for OSHA.
   OSHA had said three workers have died at the Fairless and
Clairton plants in the previous two years and 17 have died
since 1972. The agency charged that USX managers knew about
many safety deficiencies at the plants for years and failed
to take action to counteract them. OSHA also said USX didn't
properly record injuries at the Fairless plant despite
pledging to do so in April 1987.
   In addition to extending the safety effort to other plants
in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Alabama, USX's USS steelmaking
division promised to meet with the Indiana state officials to
seek a similar agreement covering the Gary, Ind., steel
plant. Indiana runs its own OSHA-approved occupational safety
and health program.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
USX closed at $30.50 a share, unchanged.
   The company agreed to the settlement partly to avoid long
and costly litigation, said Thomas Sterling, vice president,
employee relations, for USS. But he said the company has
"many areas of substantial disagreement over the OSHA
allegations." He said the Fairless and Clairton works are
"safe plants," and the USS division has set "a superb safety
record."
   The settlement was backed by United Steelworkers of
America Locals 1557 and 4889, which represent workers at the
two plants. While applauding the fines, the union said the
agreement confirms its contention that USX "willfully allowed
the safety and health conditions in its facilities to
deteriorate to such a point that workers were in serious
danger."
   The company continues to refuse to give the union reports
that it sent to OSHA describing its plans for correcting the
violations, the Steelworkers said. That signals "more battles
over safety and health at a time when other steel companies
have joined with the union in a variety of safety-related
programs," the union said.
   Responding to the union allegation, the USS division said
it and the union have safety committees at various plants,
which it said work together cooperatively and effectively.
   The USX fines don't reflect new maximum penalties for
workplace health and safety violations. Set by Congress in
the recently enacted budget law, those fines can be as much
as seven times earlier maximums; they provide for penalties
of as much as $70,000 for each "willful" violation.
   The new schedule will be applied to violations occuring on
or after Nov. 5, 1990, the effective date of the legislation,
and involving OSHA inspections begun after March 1, 1991.

   BOCA RATON, Fla. -- Office Depot Inc. and Office Club Inc.
said they agreed to merge in a transaction valued at about
$137 million.
   The two providers of office supplies said Office Club,
based in San Francisco, would become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Office Depot and would continue to operate
under its own name with its current format.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts generally applauded the agreement, saying that,
while there would be some short-term dilution in Office
Depot's earnings, the match will give Office Depot both a
large presence on the West Coast and a stronger management
team.
   The combined companies will have sales of about $1.3
billion in 1991, analysts said, further strengthening Office
Depot's position as the No. 1 player in the so-called
super-store segment of office-supply sales. That segment may
account for as much as 5% of the total U.S. market for office
supplies.
   The two companies said Office Club holders will receive
1.194 shares of Office Depot common stock for each share of
Office Club stock. There are approximately 7.2 million shares
outstanding of Office Club common. In addition, Office Depot
will assume Office Club's outstanding options, currently
representing approximately 675,000 shares of Office Club
stock.
   The transaction, which will be accounted for on a
pooling-of-interests basis, is subject to shareholder and
regulatory approval. The two companies said they anticipated
closing the transaction next spring.
   David I. Fuente will continue to serve as chairman and
chief executive officer of Office Depot, which will remain
based in Boca Raton. Mark D. Begelman, Office Club's chairman
and chief executive, will become president and chief
operating officer of Office Depot.

<LP>
   DALLAS -- Edwin T. McBirney III, former owner of Sunbelt
Savings Association of Texas, has agreed to plead guilty to
federal criminal charges and the agreement will be filed
today, his defense attorney said. The filing would come less
than 24 hours after a jury convicted Don R. Dixon, ex-owner
of Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association.
   Messrs. McBirney and Dixon have been among the
highest-priority targets of the U.S. Justice Department's war
on thrift fraud because of their gaudy life styles and the
millions of dollars in losses racked up by their thrifts.
Winning the cases against two such high-profile defendants is
a major coup for the Justice Department's oft-criticized
Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Dixon was convicted yesterday of 23 federal criminal
charges, most of them related to the use of Vernon funds to
lease a California beach house for the thrift owner. Three of
the charges related to thrift funds that paid for prostitutes
for Vernon board members. The charges carry a maximum
possible prison term of 120 years.
   Mr. Dixon was acquitted of 15 other charges relating to
the use of thrift funds to reimburse Vernon employees for
political campaign contributions and out-of-state trips with
the former commissioner of the Texas Savings and Loan
Department.
   None of the charges against Mr. Dixon dealt with any of
the questionable loans and real estate transactions that led
to Vernon's losses of almost $2 billion and its collapse in
1987. Because the charges against Mr. Dixon dealt with
relatively low-dollar expenditures, his attorney, William M.
Ravkind, predicted throughout the trial and almost nine days
of jury deliberations that Mr. Dixon would be acquitted.
   After the verdict yesterday, Mr. Dixon was ordered jailed
without bond until his sentencing in February, and an
embittered Mr. Ravkind said, "I should have pleaded him
guilty."
   The possibility of a substantial prison term following a
guilty verdict may have prompted Mr. McBirney's expected plea
agreement. The former Sunbelt Savings owner faced a maximum
possible sentence of 85 years in prison if convicted of all
17 charges filed against him in his July 11 indictment.
   Mr. McBirney's attorney, Paul E. Coggins of Dallas, said
the plea agreement will be filed in federal court in Dallas
today. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. It
wasn't known what specific charges Mr. McBirney was expected
to admit or what the terms of his plea would be.
   But in previous plea agreements with thrift executives,
the Justice Department has required defendants to cooperate
in other investigations. Mr. McBirney's cooperation, if
required, could be extremely valuable to prosecutors because
of his extensive dealings with other thrifts and their
executives.
   Among the now-failed thrifts that were involved in real
estate and loan transactions with Sunbelt and Mr. McBirney
were San Jacinto Savings Association of Houston, a unit of
Southmark Corp. until its recent seizure by thrift
regulators; Independent American Savings Assocation, which
was owned by Thomas R. Gaubert of Dallas; and Western Savings
Association of Dallas, formerly owned by Jarrett E. Woods Jr.
   The Federal Bureau of Investigation has acknowledged an
ongoing criminal investigation of San Jacinto, and Mr.
Gaubert has remained a target of federal prosecutors despite
his acquittal in October 1988 on charges related to loans
from an Iowa thrift. Mr. Woods is scheduled for trial in
January on 37 charges related to the failure of Western
Savings. If convicted, he would face a maximum possible
sentence of 185 years in prison.

   IRS Pulls Plug
   On New ESOP
   Financing Plan

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- In the figure-an-angle world of corporate
finance, sometimes even the Internal Revenue Service has a
hard time keeping up with Wall Street's deal designers.
   That's apparently what happened in a recent innovative $1
billion debt offering for Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s employee
stock ownership plan. This offering, which was devised by
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the nation's largest securities firm,
received the IRS's blessing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   P&amp;G sold the 30-year debt securities to finance the plan,
which offered a unique structure: It blended an ESOP with
retiree health liability, and was the first time such a
vehicle was used to fund retiree health benefits.
   This offering was created because of recent regulatory and
accounting requirements that called for future costs of
retiree medical benefits to be charged as a current expense.
For many large firms, that cost could be huge. The structure
Merrill devised in effect shifts the legal liability for
retiree medical benefits from P&amp;G to its ESOP. And the
dividends and interest that P&amp;G pays to the ESOP are
tax-deductible.
   The deal wasn't structured primarily to cut taxes,
according to Tax Notes magazine, but to minimize the amount
of retiree health liabilities that have to be accounted for
currently. P&amp;G's $1 billion trust holding employer securities
will be used to offset a $250 billion retiree health benefits
liability, the magazine said.
   But now the IRS is pulling back from its seal of approval
on this offering, apparently because it wants to plug the tax
loophole in Merrill's financing tactic. The agency recently
told its field offices that it was indefinitely suspending
the issuance of similar "determination letters" -- that is,
brief form letters in which the agency tells an applicant
whether a proposed plan meets the standard for tax exemption.
   The IRS's stance makes it unlikely that other securities
firms will be able to copy the structure and serves as a
warning signal to others looking to devise similar
structures, tax specialists said.
   "The IRS is saying that you proceed at your own risk,"
says David Kautter, a partner at Ernst &amp; Young in Washington.
   The tax-collection agency said, in a statement, that the
"IRS is not currently issuing any determination letters on
ESOPs where the stock is used for other than retirement
benefits. The IRS currently is reviewing the issue." The
agency refused to elaborate.
   But Richard M. Daly, an IRS employee-benefits expert who
spoke at a recent meeting of tax accountants in Orlando,
Fla., said the agency wants time to consider a number of
issues raised by plans such as P&amp;G's.
   Mr. Daly told members of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants that the issues include "whether
Congress ever intended that" ESOPs be used to finance
retiree-health plans.
   Mary Oppenheimer, IRS deputy assistant chief counsel, told
members of the New York Employee Benefits Group late last
month that any IRS challenge to transactions such as
Merrill's P&amp;G deal would be based on health and tax policy,
in addition to technical questions, according to Tax Notes.
The IRS refused to confirm or deny Ms. Oppenheimer's
statements; she couldn't be reached to comment.
   Tax specialists said the IRS is concerned that allowing
these kinds of transactions as a primary vehicle for funding
retiree medical benefits could be potentially dangerous.
"People retire and they expect they have money set aside for
retiree medical claims, but it could turn out that the
company's stock could be worth a fraction of what they had
thought," says Mr. Kautter, of Ernst &amp; Young.
   Merrill Lynch officials declined to comment.

   PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE Co.'s retiree health benefits liability
is less than $2 billion, and the company says it retains
legal liability for the retiree medical benefits of its
employee stock ownership plan. P&amp;G's benefits liability was
misstated in the Dec. 13 edition. While the IRS is

   GEVEVA, Switzerland -- The lead administrator of Polly
Peck International PLC, an embattled U.K. electronics, fruit
and leisure group, said injunctions preventing an
investigation into funds in Cyprus have been lifted.
   Michael Jordan of the accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand de
Loitte, one of three administrators appointed by a U.K. high
court to run Polly Peck, said that "an awful lot" of the
company's funds "seems to have found its way into Cyprus."

   Speaking to Polly Peck's Swiss franc bondholders here, Mr.
Jordan declined to give exact figures, saying, "In the coming
weeks, we hope to understand the situation much better."
Until it was placed into receivership Oct. 25, Polly Peck was
run by Asil Nadir, a Turkish Cypriot.
   Mr. Jordan's two fellow administrators are Richard Stone,
also of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and Christopher Morris, an
accountant with Touche Ross &amp; Co.
   Mr. Jordan said injunctions preventing review of the books
of Japan's Sansui Electric Co., in which Polly Peck holds a
72% stake, also were lifted recently.
   Regarding Del Monte Foods Inc., a San Francisco-based
canned fruit and vegetable unit of Polly Peck, Mr. Jordan
said he expects 1991 profit to exceed forecasts of 1990
earnings. He said he is convinced the company is well run and
said it is unlikely the administrators would sell Del Monte
to satisfy Polly Peck creditor demands.
   Under U.K. bankruptcy rules, the administrators must issue
a report of their findings three months after being
appointed. Mr. Jordan said that their work has been hindered
because of the injunctions and that he will ask for a
three-month extension of the deadline. He estimated debt of
the Polly Peck PLC holding company at #1 billion ($1.94
billion) and total group debt at #1.4 billion. Of that total,
Polly Peck has issued 600 million Swiss francs ($471 million)
in bonds.
   Mr. Jordan said the administrators are looking into
selling some of what he called small non-core businesses. The
Polly Peck group encompasses around 200 separate companies,
he said.

   DEL MONTE FOODS Inc. of San Francisco, a privately owned
company, was incorrectly identified in the Dec. 10 edition as
a subsidiary of Polly Peck International PLC, which has a
subsidiary named PPI Del Monte Tropical Fruit Co.
