   I enjoyed two articles on Japan in your Aug. 20 issue. The
first, "Guiding Hand: In Asia, the Japanese Hope to
`Coordinate' What Nations Produce" by Bernard Wysocki Jr.
(page one), described Japan as a lead goose leading a flock
of its Asian neighbors. Equally interesting was Stephen
Duthie's article on the bitter memories harbored by many
Asians who still remember the harsh rule by imperial Japan of
its Asian colonies before the end of World War II.
   Japan's metamorphosis from a ferocious wolf devouring its
neighbors to a docile goose assisting them deserves an
explanation. To understand Japan's past behavior, one must
remember that for centuries it was a feudal country dominated
by the Tokugawa regime and the Daimyo warlords. In the words
of a Japanese historian, it was by "the edge of the sword"
that "the virtues of hard work, thrift, self-discipline,
obedience and selfless service had been instilled in the
Japanese people." And even after the Meiji transformation in
1868, the right to vote was not universal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As late as 1918, only the Japanese taxpayers who paid a
tax of at least 10 yen had the right to vote. They
represented just 2.6% of the population. True democracy was
not introduced in Japan until the arrival of Gen. Douglas
MacArthur in 1945. Once introduced, the Japanese political
institutions have proved themselves to be as dynamic and
vibrant as the economy itself. Currently, many Asian nations
in charting their economic policies look to Japan as the
model to emulate. However, when it comes to politics, many of
these nations still bear the burden of totalitarian regimes.
Japan should impress on its neighbors the fact that
free-market economics works better in a democratic setting.
This may be a tall order, given Japan's past meddling in its
neighbors' affairs.
   However, times have changed. The new Japan can utilize its
considerable economic weight to nudge its neighbors toward
representative democracy. If this would happen, then Tokyo
would deserve credit for the spread of democracy in Southeast
Asia, the same way the U.S. deserves credit for the spread of
democracy in Japan.

   Las Vegas -- In the lobby and casino of the new Mirage
Hotel, Las Vegas's version of Grand Central Station, people
in amazing numbers mill and churn, but James "Buster"
Douglas, the undisputed heavyweight boxing champion of the
world, has a spacious mezzanine area to himself in which to
prepare for his Oct. 25 title fight with Evander Holyfield.
   Douglas's training has been closed to the public, but not,
he avers, to keep prying eyes from glimpsing an unseemly
spare tire around his waist. "I want to be with just my own
people, gettin' serious," he says. "I read where I weigh
250-260 pounds, but that's not true. I'm at 240, 241. I'll be
down to 230 easy by fight time." He was wearing a bulky sweat
shirt when he said it, so I couldn't attempt to confirm his
assertion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As for the fact that the sports book downstairs has him --
the champ -- an almost-2-to-1 underdog to the former Olympic
medalist, Buster widens his eyes, the way Ali used to.
   "Oh yes]" he exclaims. "Holyfield's a tremendous fighter]
He's always in wonderful shape. Unbeaten and untied. Very
strong. Throws combinations. Great chin."
   And how about you, Buster?
   "You ain't supposed to look at me," grins the big,
soft-faced man who will outweigh his foe at fight time by
about 20 pounds, and significantly outreach him with his
83-inch arm span. "Just keep your eyes on him for now."
   But it has been hard to keep one's eyes off Buster Douglas
of late. First came that February evening in Toyko when he
shocked the known universe by knocking out Mike Tyson, who
was not only unbeaten and untied but also virtually unscored
upon, to capture sport's most prestigious crown.
   Then came a bout that won't appear on his record, but was
tougher than many that do. His opponent was Don King,
boxing's octopus, who, having done his best to nullify the
outcome of the Tokyo tiff in favor of preferred-client Tyson,
turned his attention to enforcing the ever-after clause he
extracts from fighters he controls.
   Douglas got a draw with King, which is as good as anyone
has done since the state of Ohio nailed King for
manslaughter. King's suit to retain promotional links with
Douglas was settled out of court, with the promoter receiving
a reported $3 million. That seems like a lot until one notes
that the projected take from the Douglas-Holyfield fight,
which King won't be promoting, is $35 million, and that
Buster's share will come to $24 million.
   "It's been a fight since the fight," observes Douglas of
his legal scrap with King, but he says he never doubted its
outcome, or that of the ring battle that preceded it.
"Sometimes I can be, like, outside myself, watching what's
going on. It's like watching a TV show with me in it. I knew
the Tyson fight and the King thing would come out all right
for me. And that's the way it happened."
   The 30-year-old Douglas's premonition about the Tyson
match wasn't reflected in the odds, which were 40-or-50-to-1
in favor of Tyson in establishments that deigned to accept
wagers, or in Douglas's record. Buster entered that fray with
a 29-4-1 mark, the losses coming from fights with such
non-luminaries as David Bey, Mike White, Jesse Ferguson and
Tony Tucker.
   Douglas has labored as a pro since 1981, but since 1984
had fought no more than three times a year, partly because
few fellow pugilists lusted to tangle with a long-armed,
6-foot-4 guy who could punch. His biggest pre-Tyson paycheck
was the $200,000 he earned against Tucker in a 1987 match for
the IBF belt. He led early in that one, but faded and was
stopped in 10 rounds.
   All the while, though, he was learning. Douglas took up
boxing as a pre-teen in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, under
the tutelage of his father, Billy, an ex-pug, but he gave it
up at 15 for other sports. When the need to make a living
arose, he returned to the ring at age 21.
   "I didn't have many amateur fights, and no money behind
me. Nobody was finding guys for me to fight who'd fit my
style," he says. "I fought anybody who'd fight me. I'd sign
blank contracts and let the promoter fill in the opponent's
name. Sometimes I didn't know who I'd be fighting until the
day of the fight. Sometimes I was the opponent, if you get my
meaning.
   "But I learned what I could and couldn't do, and how I
should and shouldn't train. And I had a plan for Tyson. It
was to face him like a man. Nobody'd done that before."
   Douglas did more than face up to the intimidating Iron
Mike. He popped him with long lefts and rights, and tied him
up when he lunged in. He wobbled Tyson with combinations in
the fifth and ninth rounds before finishing him in the 10th.
Arguably, Douglas won every round, including the eighth until
he was floored by the uppercut that sparked the "long count"
flap that King, Tyson's pal, promoter and de facto manager,
fanned so energetically.
   "I was more surprised than hurt" by the knockdown punch,
recalls Douglas. He adds: "Things were going so good I found
myself watching, thinking `Look at me, I'm beatin' him up]'
The knockdown got my mind back on business."
   Douglas shrugs off questions about his plan for Holyfield,
remarking "I know he comes in and I like that. I like an
opponent to be there." He leaves the expected opponent-abuse
to his trainer, John Russell, who happily obliges. Holyfield,
declares Russell, is a "pumped-up light heavy, a 210-pound
guy with skinny legs and a 32-inch waist. Put him next to
Buster, it's like a boy next to a man. You can believe your
eyes about this one."
   Buster smiles and turns to possible future outings. Yes,
he says, he'd like to fight Tyson again one day, despite the
ex-champ's King connection, but first he wants to meet George
Foreman, the 42-year-old, 260-pound, ex-ex-champ.
   "I've seen films of George, and he's improving," says
Buster, eyes atwinkle. "He does things he never did before.
He used to load up for one big punch, but now he throws
combinations. If I don't get to him soon, he'll be too good
for me. Maybe too good for anybody."

   Regarding your Aug. 27 page-one article on Hartmarx and
men's clothing, I wonder how your writer could take such a
skewed approach. According to him, soon I shall be called
upon by men robed in mustard-colored, Italian-cut $1,000
suits. No doubt I'll be so disarmed and distracted that I'll
fail to concentrate on their salesmanship. Enter the dowdy
fellow in an American-made Hartmarx or Brooks Brothers -- the
poor guy; his appearance is so ordinary that he actually
closes the deal with me.

   ST. LOUIS -- Laclede Gas Co. said that its president and
chief operating officer Donald A. Novatny, 55 years old,
resigned from the company, effective Monday, for personal
reasons.
   Succeeding Mr. Novatny in both positions at the natural
gas distributor is Robert C. Jaudes, 56, executive vice
president-operations and marketing.

<TEXT>
   Lee Liberman, chairman and chief executive officer, said
in a written statement that Mr. Novatny's resignation was
unexpected.
   "I had intended to recommend his promotion to chief
executive officer of the company at our annual meeting next
January. However, he told me he had decided after much
thought that he simply did not want the responsibilities and
pressures" associated with that job, Mr. Liberman said.
   A Laclede spokesman said that Mr. Novatny was unavailable
to comment on his resignation.

   Harley-Davidson is often cited as an example of
"industrial policy that worked." Over the longer term,
however, the company is more likely to make it into textbooks
as a classic case study on the follies of protectionism.
   Your Aug. 31 story on Harley notes that the market for
smaller motorcycles has shrunk to a fraction of its former
self. But your writer ignores the significance of this fact.
Buyers of smaller bikes traditionally have honed their riding
skills on the less powerful machines, then "stepped up" to
ride Harleys. The motorcycle tariffs of the 1980s destroyed
this junior market. As a result, there is no younger
generation of bikers being weaned on Hondas. When
trend-conscious baby boomers eventually tire of Harleys, the
company may be hard pressed to find replacement customers.

   Iberia Airlines Targets Latin America,
   Charter Flights for Its Expansion Plans

   MADRID -- Iberia Airlines has set its sights on Latin
America for expansion as part of a global strategy aimed at
boosting profits and strengthening cooperation with other
European airlines.
   Chairman Miguel Aguilo said Latin America is "a market
where Iberia is already very strong. We intend to consolidate
that position."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Europe, Iberia will build its Viva subsidiary into a
second-tier airline to compete with the rapidly restructuring
charter business, he added.
   Thanks to lower overheads, Viva, whose full name is Vuelos
Internacionales de Vacaciones, will be able to offer
discounted flights without upsetting Iberia's tariff
structure.
   Since his June appointment, the chairman, an engineer, has
mapped out a strategy for Iberia that is based on internal
reorganization and international expansion. For the moment,
his plans appear to meet the approval of outside analysts.
   "It's a very good thing to put senior executives closer to
the marketplace and be more flexible on the marketplace,"
said Richard Bond, vice president in charge of aviation
consulting at London-based consultancy Cresap Telesis,
commenting on Iberia's internal restructuring.
   As for Viva, Mr. Bond added, "it gives a means of
competing in the transforming charter market that perhaps
Iberia itself couldn't do very well."
   Last year, Iberia's net profit plunged 74% to 6.22 billion
pesetas ($65 million) from P24.26 billion ($246 million)
because of a lengthy strike by mechanics, higher operating
costs and a drop in tourist spending.
   This year, strikes by cabin staff, combined with the
effects of the peseta's strength against the dollar, higher
fuel prices and an accentuated slump in the Spanish tourist
trade will further chop Iberia's earnings.
   Mr. Aguilo makes no effort to hide Iberia's problems. Like
other airlines, he says, "we're going into a cyclical
downturn. This year is going to be worse for us than previous
years. Profit will be reduced."
   The prospect of European deregulation, moreover, promises
"a future full of uncertainties and complexities. The only
way to face up to these challenges is through
decentralization and delegation of responsibility," he said.
   One of Mr. Aguilo's first acts since his appointment has
been to trim head-office staff and separate operating units
into individual profit centers. The process may take several
more months to complete. The goal is to improve vertical
communications, reduce staffing, and cut costs, at the same
time as giving each sector greater flexibility.
   In addition, Mr. Aguilo has put Iberia on track for
expansion in Latin America, mirroring a general trend by
Spanish companies to seek closer business links with the
continent, building on their common language and close
cultural ties.
   One of his first steps, in July, was to make what turned
out to be the only bid for 85% of Argentina's Aerolineas
Argentinas, as leader of a consortium including local
businessmen and a unit of CS First Boston Inc. Under the
plan, Iberia will take 20% of Aerolineas with an option to
raise its stake to 30%.
   In a parallel move, he said, Iberia is at an advanced
stage in negotiations with two airlines in the Caribbean for
the purchase of a shareholding in one or the other of them.
One is the Dominican Republic's Cia. Dominicana de Aviacion.
Mr. Aguilo declined to identify the other carrier, but
Spanish press reports have referred to contacts between
Iberia and the national airlines of Venezuela and Colombia.
   In Argentina, the Aerolineas acquisition has been slowed
by problems that Mr. Aguilo said appear to be related to
local political opposition to President Carlos Menem's
privatization plans. Though Iberia is ready to make a
scheduled first payment of $130 million, problems have been
raised by banks over how the funds should be channeled in
relation to existing debts.
   Mr. Aguilo warned that Iberia can't wait indefinitely for
these problems to be sorted out, but he doesn't consider the
project to be in danger.
   Through this link-up and the planned tie-up in the
Caribbean, Iberia's aim is to operate two hub systems to
serve both business and tourist traffic in Latin America.
   In both cases, the link-ups would be designed to allow
Iberia and its prospective partner airlines to rationalize
flight schedules both to and from Latin America and within
Latin America and Europe.
   In Buenos Aires, Iberia plans to locate small planes for
use on its own flights within Latin America, instead of
continuing on local flight-legs with costly trans-Atlantic
jumbo jets, as at present. In addition to boosting profits,
the project is designed to make Iberia a more attractive
partner for cooperation with other European airlines.
   Rather than provoking a series of mergers, Mr. Aguilo
predicts, deregulation will cause European airlines to
cooperate in a series of small ways, gradually building up
closer links.
   Iberia already has taken a series of steps in that
direction, for example, through participation in the Amadeus
computer reservations system, which groups several European
airlines.
   Earlier this summer, the carrier launched a code-sharing
accord with Alitalia under which Iberia carries the Italian
airline's passengers on its Madrid-Mexico City flights and
Alitalia does the same for Iberia on its Rome-Bangkok route.
   Mr. Aguilo said that this agreement is working well and
that cooperation between the two airlines is likely to be
expanded "providing it's in the interests of both partners."
   Similarly, he said, Iberia is waiting for the European
Community Commission to give its clearance for a planned
cooperation pact between West Germany's Lufthansa and Air
France to see whether it can join that project. Lufthansa and
Air France have proposed cooperating in such areas as pilot
training, catering and executive exchanges. EC officials are
examining the plan to see whether it conflicts with
competition rules.
   Starting next summer, Viva -- originally set up with
Lufthansa as a joint venture for charters -- will serve as
Iberia's second-tier carrier for flights between smaller
cities in Spain and other European countries, mainly Britain
and West Germany.
   With younger staff, newer planes and lower operating
overheads, Viva will be able to offer tariffs competing with
the charter market. Ultimately, Mr. Aguilo predicted, the
European charter market will die out and charter companies
will convert to scheduled flights.
   "Viva will aim less at business traffic and more at
tourism. It's a question of adjusting products to their
markets."

   Seoul Changes
   Position on Travel
   To North Korea

   SEOUL, South Korea -- The South Korean government is
 making a significant shift in its position on travel to
 North Korea, in an effort to introduce subtle pressure
 within the country for change.
                                                                                                       

   Seoul is turning to the millions of Koreans, by birth or
 heritage, who live overseas, sending signals that it no
 longer opposes visits to the communist North. Because most
 overseas Koreans speak the country's language, they are more
 apt to have contact with ordinary North Koreans when they
 visit, Seoul reasons. And the more North Koreans learn about
 the world, the greater the chance they will pressure their
 government for change, as Eastern Europeans did.
                                                                                                       

   "There are many ways to induce change into North Korea,"
 says Choi Chang Yoon, a senior secretary to President Roh
 Tae Woo. "Our efforts to have direct contacts is just one
 way."
                                                                                                       

   Mr. Choi says that when the new policy becomes known, "We
 expect there will be an overseas rush." But no one expects
 overnight change in North Korea. "Unification is a long-term
 project," he says.
                                                                                                       

   The North Korean government discourages contacts between
 its people and South Korean citizens, despite high-level
 government talks this month. The only contact between
 ordinary citizens occurred back in 1985 for a few separated
 families. Pyongyang doesn't even allow newspapers, mail or
 media contact between the two countries.
                                                                                                       

   In the past, South Korea has made it difficult for
 overseas Koreans, especially those in the U.S., to travel to

 traveler would be forbidden future entry to South Korea,
 harassment of a traveler's family in South Korea, or even
 surveillance in the traveler's home country. Government
 officials admit such tactics were once used but say they
 have since been abandoned.
                                                                                                       

   But that message hasn't gotten through to
 Korean-Americans: They have listened for so long to
 propaganda that they would be kidnapped or murdered in North
 Korea that many still won't consider traveling there. "The
 South Korean government doesn't want people to go there,"
 says Marsha Choon Ja Kim, who runs the AllGold Travel &amp;
 Tours agency in Los Angeles. And under U.S. laws, she says,
 North Korea is off-limits.
                                                                                                       

   Mrs. Kim says contact is made difficult because the U.S.
 prevents phone calls, telexes and telegrams to North Korea.
 Indeed, the State Department still has a stern warning in
 effect against travel to North Korea. Still, she says, "More
 and more people want to go there." She can't directly
 arrange a trip because of U.S. regulations, but steers
 clients to agents overseas who can.
                                                                                                       

   The North Koreans are likely to be enthusiastic about an
 increase in visitors because of the hard currency entering
 the country. (South Koreans could provide hard cash, too,
 but their visits carry political implications that make the
 North Korean government uncomfortable.)
                                                                                                       

   About 20,000 people visit North Korea each year, as many
 as half of them from the East bloc. Pyongyang is building
 hotels and encouraging tourism, but is reluctant to grant
 visas to Americans who aren't of Korean extraction, travel
 agents say.
                                                                                                       

   South Korea estimates that 1.2 million Koreans live in
 the U.S. and 670,000 in Japan (Koreans in Japan who are
 affiliated with North Korea aren't included in that number).
 There are an estimated 1.6 million ethnic Koreans in China,
 which borders North Korea. And about 450,000 live in the
 Soviet Union, some as far away as Tashkent, near
 Afghanistan, where they were forcibly moved during the
 Stalin era.
                                                                                                       

   The South Korean government is also trying to foster a
 sense of a "Korean commonwealth" among overseas Koreans,
 particularly in the Soviet Union and China, who have easier
 access to North Korea. South Korean business ventures, such
 as a Siberian logging operation by the giant Hyundai group,
 use ethnic Koreans.
                                                                                                       

   "We will open a small hole with business that will create
 more change," says Lee Hong Koo, a South Korean adviser.
 "Build a national community through business, and political
 solution will naturally follow," he says.
                                                                                                       

   Soviet music and athletic coaches of Korean heritage have
 been invited to South Korea. The government also sponsored
 an Olympic-style Pan-Korean athletic competition in late
 1989 that drew 1,326 Korean competitors from 50 nations.
 Diplomats in Seoul say the event seems to have created a
 feeling of belonging among Koreans that may translate into
 pressure on North Korea as well.

   Airlines Resort to Penny-Pinching Ploys
   To Bring Their Fuel Bills Back to Earth

   Going easy on the gas pedal now that it takes a twenty
dollar bill to fill up your Toyota? What would you do if you
were buying the fuel for a DC-10?
   The answer, the nation's airlines say, is just about
everything imaginable. Since one of those jumbo jets averages
less than half a mile a gallon, your bill for a jaunt from
New York to Los Angeles would be somewhere around seven
grand.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For starters, you'd probably do what you do in your car --
spare the throttle, coast a lot, cut engine idling time and
avoid unnecessary miles. But there are many more tricks than
that, airlines say, from intentionally enduring bumpy rides
and foregoing early arrivals to keeping the outside of
aircraft paint-free. And these days, they're all being used
-- including at least one trick, carrying less fuel, that
makes some industry people nervous.
   Jet fuel is the second-biggest day-to-day expense for most
airlines, behind labor. AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, the
nation's largest carrier, burns 2.5 billion gallons each
year. So the 65% price jump since the Middle East crisis
began on Aug. 2 has raised its annual fuel bill by about $875
million.
   Cost increases like that, coupled with softening travel,
have the industry headed for a record $1 billion loss this
year, analysts say. To cope, carriers are cutting employment,
reducing schedules, raising fares -- and pinching pennies on
fuel.
   American Airlines recently sent its cockpit crews and
dispatchers a detailed, 13-point bulletin on conserving fuel,
"the lifeblood of our operation." Says William Syblon, a
pilot and American's flight operations technical manager:
"We've redoubled our efforts. . . . It is a very critical
issue." Similarly, Pan American World Airways has
"rejuvenated" its fuel-saving program. "It's worth a
considerable amount of money," says chief pilot Norm Davies.
The Pan Am Corp. unit may even dump some of its biggest,
least-economical jets altogether.
   While airlines have been fuel-conscious since the first
energy crunch in the 1970s, "it's more important now," agrees
Donald J. Breeding, Continental Airlines' senior vice
president of operations. "We're looking at a potential
downturn next year and at the same time an increase in fuel
expense," he says.
   Continental pays quarterly bonuses to pilots and other
employees for cutting fuel costs. The program dates to the
mid-1980s, but it's being pushed anew. "We're trying to make
our people more sensitive," Mr. Breeding says. The carrier
splits its savings with 4,000 eligible employees. Last year,
when the plan yielded $20 million, captains got $4,500 each.
This year's pool is likely to be much higher.
   Basically, airlines are re-examining anything that uses
fuel. Among American's recommendations to pilots: Cruise at
the optimum altitude suggested by the plane's on-board
performance computer, even if passengers must endure "some
degree of light chop."
   That means a pilot might not opt for the smoothest ride
anymore if a slightly bumpier one is more fuel-efficient,
says Mr. Syblon. Planes burn less fuel at higher levels
because the air is thinner. So now, "if it's not too choppy,
we encourage pilots to stay there and save fuel," he says.
   The payoff would seem hardly worth the bother at first. A
Boeing 757 flying at 35,000 feet on a transcontinental trip
might save 200 gallons -- about $200 -- by moving up to its
optimum altitude, 39,000 feet. But "if you could do it every
day on thousands of trips, it's pretty easy to see why you
would," Mr. Syblon says. Indeed, if American Airlines could
save $200 on each of its 2,300 daily flights, it would
recover some $460,000 a day, or more than 20% of the increase
in its fuel bill.
   Besides encouraging pilots to fly high, airlines are
admonishing them to fly straight. The most direct route can
shave two to three minutes off a two-hour flight, and as much
as 10 minutes off a five-hour one, says Mr. Syblon. In 10
minutes, a 757 burns $180 worth of fuel.
   On the other hand, deciding how fast to fly gets tricky.
After takeoff, it may pay to hit the throttles harder than
usual to reach a money-saving cruising altitude as soon as
possible. Once there, however, a lighter touch than usual
might be in order.
   Pan Am encourages pilots running ahead of schedule on
long-distance routes to back off rather than to arrive at
their destinations early. Slowing a Rome-to-New York flight
by 14 miles an hour, for example, can save $368 -- though it
makes the trip 14 minutes longer.
   American Airlines urges its pilots to ask air controllers
for permission to slow down rather than to change course when
maneuvering into line for landing at busy airports. Changing
course burns more fuel by adding distance.
   But there's such a thing as being too poky. Pan Am says
slowing a flight beyond its allotted time could trigger
overtime pay for crews, wiping out any fuel saving. "In
general, you save fuel if you fly slower, but time costs
money, so we try to seek a balance," agrees American's Mr.
Syblon.
   And sometimes, slowing down isn't feasible. "The area
where we are going to save more fuel is in a well-planned
descent," Mr. Breeding says. In the perfect descent, the
plane glides down from its cruising altitude with the engines
at idle. But controllers can order pilots to kick in the
power and speed up because traffic may be stacking up behind
them.
   While skillful flying saves money, there may be even more
to be made on the ground. Some tricks are obvious: Use
electricity from the terminal to run lights and air
conditioning while at the gate; delay engine start-up until
the last minute and taxi on only one engine.
   Some are not so obvious: Mesa Airlines, a 38-plane
regional carrier, hired 14 tanker trucks last month to haul
120,000 gallons of jet fuel 450 miles from Denver to its
Albuquerque, N.M., hub because it discovered fuel was much
cheaper in Denver. Mesa came out 10 cents a gallon ahead even
after trucking costs, says Vice President Jonathan Ornstein.
   Some tactics are controversial. Carriers are taking a hard
look at the amount of fuel loaded into planes. Crews don't
simply fill up each trip. Extra fuel makes a plane heavier,
which in turn makes it burn more fuel. American Airlines
calculates that a plane constantly carrying around an
unnecessary 1,000 pounds of fuel-just under 150 gallons-would
boost its costs by $15,045 a year.
   Currently, most airlines load enough fuel to fly a given
route, plus a safety allowance required by federal
regulations, plus an additional cushion beyond that. The idea
of scrimping on that cushion bothers the Air Line Pilots
Association, the union representing most airline pilots.
   Cutting back "shrinks somewhat the safety buffer that we
have built into the airline business," an ALPA spokesman
worries. He concedes carrying a bit less probably wouldn't by
itself cause an accident, but he contends it might complicate
other problems that could arise. "You always want to maximize
the safety buffer," he says.
   Airlines insist they don't take any fuel-saving steps
without first weighing safety. "There will be no instances in
which Delta will compromise safety. That's our No. 1
priority," declares a Delta Air Lines spokesman. At
Continental, Mr. Breeding says, "That's the first question we
ask ourselves: `Is it safe?' If the answer is no, we drop it
right there."
   Weight-watching extends way beyond fuel loads. American
Airlines seems to have its planes on a constant diet. A few
years ago, it took 1,500 pounds off each of its Boeing 727s
by making seats lighter, changing metal food carts to
reinforced plastic and redesigning the structure of the
galley. It has even calculated the relative efficiency of
painted and unpainted planes -- and opted for no paint except
red, white and blue stripes. An unpainted DC-10 is about 400
pounds lighter and about $12,000 a year cheaper to fly,
American Airlines says.
   It pays to be flexible on weight matters, however. Pan Am
has at times recently pumped an extra 5,400 gallons of fuel
into planes leaving Los Angeles for Washington, because the
California fuel was 22 cents a gallon cheaper. Even with the
extra weight, the airline came out $387 ahead each flight.
"It's the same concept as if you drove to New Jersey and
filled up there and then drove back to Manhattan," a

   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission plans to let
Japanese auto makers have as much as 11% of the French and
Italian markets by the end of 1998, more than triple their
current share, a senior EC official said.
   The figure is part of a so-called voluntary agreement for
Japanese auto makers to gradually increase their potential
share in the protected EC market after the planned
unification of the 12 EC nations' markets in 1992. The
tentative accord was worked out in private talks in recent
months between the EC Commission and Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Spain, the commission intends to allow Japanese makers
as much as 19% of the auto market.
   The French and Italian governments have objected to the
allotment as too generous. But the EC official said the 11%
figure represents the upper limit that Japanese car makers
would be likely to reach eight years from now. If European
car makers become more competitive, the official said, the
Japanese share could be lower.
   Japanese auto makers currently are restricted to less than
3% of the market in France, 1.5% in Italy and 1.2% in Spain.
In EC nations that haven't imposed such curbs, Japanese car
makers already have significant market shares. For example,
Japanese manufacturers have 15% of the auto market in West
Germany, 20% in Belgium and 40% in Ireland.

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the
Supreme Court nomination of Judge David Souter by a 13-1
vote, and approval by the full Senate is expected next week.
   At least five of the eight Democrats on the committee
expressed reservations about the views of the 51-year-old New
Hampshire judge, but only Sen. Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts voted against him.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), the committee chairman, said
his support for the nominee "is a very close call." He said
he has questions about Judge Souter's commitment to
separation of church and state, eliminating race and sex
discrimination, and protecting the right to privacy and
abortion. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) said he was
unsure but was voting his instincts. "My sense is that David
Souter is a fair and open-minded jurist," he said.
   Including Sen. Kennedy, six senators, all Democrats, have
announced their opposition to Judge Souter thus far. And
Senate aides say there aren't likely to be more than a dozen
votes against the nomination. The opponents are Sens. Bill
Bradley and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, Alan Cranston of
California, Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Brock Adams of
Washington.
   Yesterday, Sen. Kennedy warned that Judge Souter might
"solidify a 5-4 anti-civil rights, anti-privacy majority
inclined to turn back the clock. . ."

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The Finance Ministry set a 25.8
billion mark ($16.48 billion) additional borrowing
requirement for 1990, as part of West Germany's third, and
largest, supplementary budget for the year.
   Ministry officials said the new borrowing will bring the
all-German federal spending deficit to 66.8 billion marks for
this year, a 63% jump from the combined 41 billion-mark
deficit previously planned for both German states, which will
reunite next Wednesday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel today will present a new
budget outline, requiring the additional borrowing to cover
20.1 billion marks in new federal spending and about five
billion marks in new credits pledged to East German
municipalities last July. Officials said the supplementary
budget, which is to become the first budget of a united
Germany, was crafted after an effort to siphon funds from
Bonn programs.
   The new strains on West German capital markets don't end
there. Including off-budget financing for the agency trying
to salvage East Germany's inefficient industries, and deficit
spending of West German states and municipalities, the total
public-sector deficit of a united Germany will total about
100 billion marks this year, even after a 20 billion mark
surplus in West Germany's social security system. In 1989,
West Germany had a public-sector deficit of 21.6 billion
marks.
   The newly budgeted all-German federal spending of 20.1
billion marks is added to the previously budgeted outlays of
311.8 billion marks for the West German federal government,
and 64.2 billion marks for the central government of East
Germany.

   Bank Stocks Sink on Fears Loan Problems Understated

   NEW YORK -- Wall Street is killing the banks.
   Money managers dumped bank stocks for the fifth session in
a row yesterday, amid rising fear that the banking industry's
exposure to problem domestic loans is worse than bankers
believe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp shares fell 75 cents, to close at $13.75, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, bringing its loss for
the past week to $2.875. Chemical Banking Corp. shares took
much the same hit, and fell 87.5 cents to $14.125 yesterday,
while Manufacturers Hanover Corp. shares have plunged $5.625
since last Thursday's close, finishing yesterday at $20.25,
off $1.
   And it isn't just the money-center banks in New York that
are being bludgeoned.
   NCNB Corp., after reporting late Wednesday that it will
increase its allowance for loan losses and post sharply lower
third-quarter earnings, yesterday was driven down $3.125 a
share to $20.125 on the Big Board.
   "There's a real serious question of confidence in the
banking system," Jack Conlon, head of trading at Rothschild
Inc., said. "Banks have become totally disfavored by
institutional investors and are under heavy liquidation."
Another trader said this was the first week in nearly two
months that Iraq and the price of oil took a back seat in the
stock market to concern about the health of big banks.
   The catalyst for the current sell-off was Chase Manhattan
Corp.'s stunning announcement last Friday that it would lay
off 5,000 employees, take $1 billion in charges and slash the
quarterly dividend from 62 cents a share to 30 cents.
   What has unnerved many investors is that the latest
declines come after months of steady price erosion in the
shares of large banks. Before this past week, the shares of
most large banks had declined 45% or more since last October.
   And as the end of the third quarter approaches, many money
managers don't want to have their reports to clients showing
large stockholdings of banks that may further disappoint
investors.
   To be sure, some Wall Street analysts suggest that fears
of dividend cuts, at least among the biggest and best-known
banks, such as Citicorp, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover,
are overblown.
   "The market is pointing a finger at those institutions,"
said James McDermott, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette
&amp; Woods, a securities firm that specializes in banks. "But I
wouldn't draw a straight line from Chase's action to those
banks without taking a hard look at cash generation and
overall asset quality. At this stage, we have no reason to
believe any similar action is imminent."
   In any event, the big question plaguing bank investors now
is how bad can it get, said Judah Kraushaar, a bank analyst
at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "The tremendous pressure on the bank
stocks reflects a crisis of confidence and an inability of
anyone to quantify the banks' exposure to nonperforming
assets," he said.
   Prices of bank stock prices have fallen so far that many
of them now sport dividend yields -- the ratio of the
dividend to the stock's market price -- well into double
digits. But few money managers are being lured by the
attractive yields. They fear that bigger problems, and
perhaps dividend cuts, may be announced next month, along
with third-quarter earnings.
   "I suspect you've got another round of dividend cuts still
to come," said Brett Brubaker, a money manager at Abraham &amp;
Sons in Chicago.
   The prospect of dividend cuts looms for many banks because
of reduced earnings. Indeed, bank specialists say any bank at
which earnings fail to cover its dividend for two quarters
will be forced by regulators to cut or eliminate the
dividend. When a bank announces a large provision against
losses for problem loans, the charge is taken against
earnings and, for accounting purposes, a dividend may not be
covered.
   But inadequate earnings aren't the only threat to payouts.
Capital levels are becoming more important, too. As
deteriorating real estate portfolios force bigger charge-offs
and reserves for loan losses, many banks will find their
capital sagging enough to trigger the attention of
regulators.
   While sick real estate markets have a lot to do with the
beating that banks are taking among investors, Merrill
Lynch's Mr. Kraushaar suggested that investors are looking
beyond the economic cycle to the banking industry's more
fundamental problem: There are simply too many banks.
   "Everybody is so focused on overcapacity in this industry,
and there's no good gauge to measure that capacity," he said.
"The only thing I could foresee to shake people up on the
positive side would be two large banks announcing a merger.
But in this environment, I wouldn't hang my hat on that."
   Still, amid all the gloom, some investors are beginning to
sense that bank stocks are approaching attractive levels.
Ralph Blair, a trader at Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco, said he saw evidence yesterday for the first time
this week that some bargain hunters were beginning to buy
battered bank stocks.
   And while Mr. Brubaker of Abraham still is wary of more
dividend cuts, he said the banking industry's tendency to
lead the stock market both down and up will eventually make
bank issues attractive.
   "They're getting to the point where you've got to think
about owning them," he said. "It's just a matter of when do
you pull the trigger?"
   Frank DeSantis, a bank analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said
his chief worry isn't so much that economic fundamentals will
force dividend cuts, but that nervous regulators may press
the issue.
   "The wild card is the political pressure of the regulatory
agencies," he said. "There's definite regulatory pressure to
raise capital, and the only thing that will ease that
pressure is if banks continue to comfortably earn the
dividend and maintain stability in loan performance."

   OSLO -- Norway's unemployment rate fell to 4% in late
September from 4.8% at the end of August, largely because of
government work programs, but the rate was up from 3.6% a
year earlier, the state Labor Directorate said.
   Unemployment has more than doubled since 1987, when the
annual unemployment figure was 2%.

   The directorate said 86,800 people in Norway were without
work in September, 17,600 fewer than in August but up 7,300
from September 1989.
   Provisional figures showed that the total of people
employed in government work and training programs in
September was about 43,300, up 15,400 from August. The total
was 57,300 in September 1989.

management, as part of its succession plan.
   Vincent A. Gierer Jr., formerly executive vice president
and chief financial officer, was named president and chief
operating officer. As president, the 42-year-old Mr. Gierer
succeeds Louis F. Bantle, chairman and chief executive
officer, who had assumed the additional post after Nicolas A.
Buoniconti resigned as president and chief operating officer
last December. Mr. Bantle, 61, had left the operating chief's
post vacant.

   Jack Africk, 61, formerly executive vice president and
president of UST's U.S. Tobacco Co. unit, was elected a vice
chairman of the parent. He will oversee legal and government
relations and a new corporate development department.
   Succeeding Mr. Africk as U.S. Tobacco president is Joseph
R. Taddeo, who was senior vice president of the unit. Mr.
Taddeo also was elected a UST director, increasing board
membership to nine.
   UST said much of Mr. Gierer's former responsibilities as
chief financial officer will be assumed by John J.
Bucchignano, who was named principal financial officer and
senior vice president, and will remain principal accounting
officer and controller.
   UST produces smokeless tobacco sold under brand names such
as Copenhagen and Skoal. It also markets wines and makes
tobacco-related products, such as pipes and pipe tobacco.

   WASHINGTON -- Continued real estate lending woes have
moved the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to increase loss
projections for its bank insurance fund this year to $3
billion from the $2 billion it was predicting earlier this
month.
   The forecast was the latest in a flurry of gloomy
assessments about the decline in the health of the nation's
banks. While failures on the scale of the savings and loan
mess aren't expected, the news has been sour enough to push
Congress, regulatory agencies and the Bush administration to
plow ahead with plans to reform the nation's deposit
insurance system and restructure the industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "These reports create a healthy sense of alarm," said
Robert Litan, a banking expert with the Brookings Institution
who said the sense of urgency also has prompted legislators
and lobbyists to show greater flexibility as reform proposals
move through Congress.
   "There has been a remarkable degree of consensus in some
areas," he said. All the pending proposals would, to some
degree, shift risk from the insurance fund to depositors and
the banks.
   Even before the new loss forecasts were announced, the
FDIC planned to raise insurance premiums that banks pay to
19.5 cents per $100 of deposits from 12 cents per $100.
Yesterday, the agency approved that regulation, proposed one
month ago; the increase will take effect in January.
   The FDIC loss projection was based on worse-than-expected
financial results for the first half of the year for the
banking industry and the fund. While the FDIC originally
predicted a fund loss of $2 billion for the entire year, it
reported yesterday that the fund posted losses of $1.8
billion in the first half alone. In all of 1989, its losses
totalled $851 million.
   If the insurance fund falls by the $3 billion now
projected, the fund will close the year at about $10 billion,
compared with $18 billion only two years ago. The fund will
drop to a level equal to just 0.5% of insured deposits, its
thinnest margin ever.
   The new projection assumes the failure of 35 unidentified
banks and savings banks that were cited by the General
Accounting Office in its recent assessment of the bank fund,
according to FDIC Chairman William Seidman. The FDIC
previously had assumed that some of these institutions would
collapse, and in fact, 15 already have been closed. All of
the institutions have, or had, more than $100 million in
assets.
   Failure of all 35 of the institutions could add $2 billion
in net cost to the fund. Reserving for those possible
failures is the most conservative course to follow, Mr.
Seidman said, but it's too soon to know what final losses
will be. "The estimate we made may well be wrong again," he
warned. "It may even be too high."
   Indeed, most analysts remain relatively sanguine about the
fund, even if they are more pessimistic about the industry.
"As far as insuring the broad base of the country's banks,
the numbers still work," said Alex Sheshunoff, who closely
tracks financial industry data for Sheshunoff Information
Services Inc., in San Antonio, Texas.
   The House has passed legislation that would give the FDIC
authority to raise insurance premiums as necessary. The
Senate may take up a version of the bill today. Mr. Seidman
said yesterday that the FDIC would consider increasing
assessments again if Congress grants the authority. "But I
don't think we can fix the fund solely by raising premiums,"
he added.
   Various congressional committees continue to hold hearings
on a variety of proposals to restructure the banking system,
but no action is likely until after Jan. 1, when the Bush
administration is expected to unveil a proposal of its own.
   With the savings and loan disaster fresh in mind, every
pending proposal calls for closer supervision of banks and
thrifts, early intervention by regulators -- possibly in the
form of restricting dividends -- if bank capital slips, and
controls to discourage financial institutions away from
taking large risks with insured deposits. In addition, there
are proposals to reduce insurance coverage for pension funds
and other big depositors.
   But regulators worry that Congress will push through
proposals that would inject new instability into the
already-rattled industry. "The last thing we need are
political or private interests masquerading as public
policy," warned Robert Clarke, comptroller of the currency.

class-action suit related to Mr. Pickens's 1984 bid to
acquire Phillips Petroleum Co. Mesa will contribute almost $5
million, and the other defendants, including Phillips, will
contribute a total of about $1.7 million for payments to
shareholders who bought Phillips stock during the two weeks
that Mr. Pickens's takeover bid was pending. Mesa and the
other defendants said they aren't admitting wrongdoing.
   The shareholders, in a suit in Delaware federal court,
claimed that they relied on Mr. Pickens's statements at the
time that he wouldn't sell any of his Phillips stock back to
Phillips "except on an equal basis with all other
shareholders." The holders claimed that Mr. Pickens received
cash for his stock plus reimbursement for his expenses that
was worth more than the securities and notes offered other
holders.
   Mesa financial adviser Sidney Tassin said the
partnership's share of both settlements will be paid from
cash reserves and isn't expected to have an impact on the
company's earnings.
   A spokesman for Mr. Pickens said there was little
connection between the two cases. "The only link is these are
two outstanding legal issues he wants to get rid of," the
spokesman said. "He wants to put all his energies into the
energy business."
   But both cases clearly raise questions involving
statements -- or lack of statements -- about Mr. Pickens's
intentions regarding stock he controlled. In both cases,
smaller investors followed Mr. Pickens in buying the
companies' shares and, in both cases, allegedly suffered
losses.
   In the SEC's case against Mr. Pickens, the agency alleged
that Mesa and partners acquired 3.8% of Homestake, or 3.5
million common shares in 1987 and 1988. Mr. Pickens and
others at Mesa decided on Feb. 28, 1988, to issue a news
release disclosing the stake and announcing an acquisition
bid for Homestake, the SEC said.
   At the same meeting, Mr. Pickens and the others discussed
a strategy where they might sell part of the Homestake
holding after the news of the Mesa acquisition bid was
disseminated, the SEC alleged.
   The next morning, Mesa announced that it was launching a
$20-a-share bid for Homestake. Homestake shares jumped on the
news, rising to more than $18 a share from about $14 a share.
But just hours later, Mesa sold 107,300 shares of Homestake
and more than 2,000 of the mining company's call options,
which become more valuable when the common stock rises, the
agency charged.
   Over the next week, without issuing any other news
release, Mesa sold more than a million Homestake shares and
1,200 more options contracts, the SEC contended. In the days
after Homestake publicly announced that it had rejected
Mesa's bid on March 7, Mesa sold an additional 2,158,600
Homestake shares, the SEC said.
   Spokesmen for Mr. Pickens and Mesa said they agreed to
settle the charges "to avoid the time, distraction and
expense of protracted litigation."
   The case is a bit of a departure for the SEC because Mesa
didn't own more than 5% of Homestake stock and, therefore,
wasn't required to file any disclosure documents with the
SEC. But once Mesa decided to issue the news release, SEC
enforcement officials said, it made a false and misleading
public statement.
   "Once you choose to speak and decide to make statements to
the market that may affect a market for a security, you have
an obligation to disclose things accurately and completely,"
said SEC enforcement director William McLucas.

   WINTERSBURG, Ariz. -- The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission proposed a $75,000 civil penalty against the Palo
Verde Nuclear Generating Station for two apparent violations
of NRC rules on medical examinations for operators.
   The station is owned by a consortium of seven utilities,
including the Arizona Public Service Co. unit of Pinnacle
West Capital Corp., Phoenix.

<TEXT>
   Licensed operators of nuclear power plants are required to
have biannual medical exams. The commission said the station
apparently failed to notify the NRC about four licensed
operators who had developed potentially incapacitating
medical conditions. It also cited apparent inaccuracies in
certification to the NRC that candidates for operator
licenses had received complete medical exams.
   The apparent violations occurred between May 1987 and last
August. Palo Verde said the safety of the plant wasn't
affected. Palo Verde has 30 days to respond to the notice.

salmon from Norway are being sold in the U.S. at less than
their home-market prices or production costs.
   The department recommended anti-dumping duties of 1.66% to
4.90% to be imposed on the imports to offset their alleged
price advantage over salmon harvested by U.S. fleets.

   The duties are to be collected if the finding is verified

   PARIS -- Pechiney S.A. reported that first-half
consolidated profit, after payments to minority interests,
more than doubled to 3.94 billion francs ($752 million) from
1.75 billion francs a year earlier.
   But the state-controlled metals and packaging concern said
that, excluding one-time gains, earnings would have risen
only 6% to 1.25 billion francs from 1.18 billion francs. The
latest results included a gain of 2.69 billion francs from
the sale of Pechiney's headquarters in central Paris; a year
earlier, the company had a gain of 575 million francs from
the initial public offering of 25% of its Pechiney
International unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On an operating level, first-half results were hurt by
lower aluminum prices and the franc's firm tone against the
dollar.
   Gross operating profit declined to 3.49 billion francs
from 4.82 billion francs, and profit from current operations
eased to 2.12 billion francs from 2.99 billion francs.
   Consolidated revenue fell 11% to 40.1 billion francs from
44.69 billion francs.

   In reprinting an article by Yossi Sarid of the Israeli
Ratz-CRM Party (editorial page, Sept. 10), you editorialized
that the article "touched off an outpouring of similar
statements from the Israeli left doubting whether compromise
with Palestinians is possible."
   Your readers should know that Shulamith Aloni, head of
CRM, and CRM Knesset member Dedi Zucker both criticized Mr.
Sarid. Mr. Zucker said Mr. Sarid's statement that the
Palestinians will now have to "look for me" when they want to
talk is in fact a classic right-wing argument. "Anyone who
conditions negotiations on the Palestinians changing their
leadership is speaking with the Likud's mouth, because the
Likud, too, is unwilling to talk to them unless they change
their leadership," Mr. Zucker said. Said Mr. Aloni: "Never
has the enemy dictated our moral criteria or determined what
was good and right for the State of Israel."

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Gulf Crisis, by Shifting Spotlight From Problems
   At Home, Already Is Affecting Politics in U.S.

   WASHINGTON -- By diverting voters' attention from
President Bush's mounting domestic problems, events in the
Persian Gulf already are having a significant short-term
impact on domestic politics, The Wall Street Journal's panel
of political experts agrees.
   "Before this happened {the crisis in the Gulf}, all the
chickens were coming home to roost -- the budget deficit, an
impending recession, the S&amp;L crisis," says Democratic
consultant Greg Schneiders. "This has stopped the slide."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The whole international equation is a major plus" for Mr.
Bush, says GOP theoretician Kevin Phillips. "Without the
combination of Panama and the Middle East, without Noriega
and Saddam Hussein, his {job-approval ratings} would be
somewhere between 48% and 55%," instead of 75% as measured in
the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.
   The other two members of the panel, Republican strategist
John Sears and Democratic consultant Alan Baron, also agree
the rally-round fervor for the deployment of U.S. armed
forces adds up to a political plus for Mr. Bush as voters
prepare to cast ballots in the Nov. 6 off-year elections.
   Yet, it isn't all bad news for the Democrats. The
panelists agree that the drama of the events in the Middle
East, with Democrats offering enthusiastic support to Mr.
Bush, will tend to "freeze" incumbents in office in the House
and Senate.
   The Journal's panelists aren't nearly so confident in
trying to estimate the long-range implications of Mr. Bush's
Mideast policy, except to agree that it will turn out to be
markedly decisive one way or another. They do agree that
there is almost no chance of a neat solution in which the
well-guarded Saddam Hussein would be overthrown or
assassinated.
   The panelists also made these other points in a meeting
with Journal reporters and editors:
   -- Republicans may be more likely to split over the events
in the Persian Gulf than Democrats.
   -- Whatever the outcome in the Middle East, the likely
Democratic nominee in 1992 is New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, but
he would be hard-pressed to defeat Mr. Bush without a sharp
economic decline.
   -- And, finally, Mr. Bush is going to allow Vice President
Quayle to remain on the ticket in 1992, with a slight
possibility he might be dumped if the economy were to take a
horrific downturn.
   Nothing unnerves politicians more than uncertainty, and
these campaign veterans are stunned by the doubts that now
engulf domestic politics in the wake of Mr. Bush's decision
to send troops to halt Saddam Hussein's aggression.
   "It's such a high-wire act," says Mr. Schneiders. "You can
come up with scenarios in which he {Mr. Bush} loses terribly
in 1992 or wins easily."
   Mr. Sears says President Bush is betting on nothing less
than a new world order "to create effective policy against
aggression." The administration "is stacking its political
future on the belief the alliance can hold together and the
means undertaken will be effective enough to solve the
problem in the Middle East," he says. If it works, says Mr.
Sears, the president wins. If it fails, Democrats and
Republicans will line up to criticize what he has tried to
do.
   Mr. Baron raises the question of U.S. casualties.
   "If we get into fighting," he says, "it will not be a
matter of losing a hundred lives. There will be serious
losses over there." He envisions questions being raised about
the fact that U.S. troops would be bearing the brunt of the
fighting. "You can already see in Congress some of this
criticism of our allies for not putting as much at stake as
we are. Opposition could develop fast."
   Mr. Sears says voters would be especially outraged if "the
bodies come home as a result of terrorist acts against people
driving trucks in American military camps. Even a few people
killed like that is a problem for us."
   Generally, though, Mr. Sears believes the American people
support the president. "They sense that something should be
done about it. They don't like this man {Saddam Hussein} they
see from Iraq on television."
   Mr. Baron and Mr. Phillips worry that public opinion could
change if voters see what's happening in the Persian Gulf
strictly in economic terms. "All of a sudden," says Mr.
Phillips, "if you've got bodies coming home and it's an
economic war, you get into one of the questions that's been
so difficult for American jurisprudence in the '80s. How do
you value a life? That's going to be an awful thing to have
to explain."
   The panelists all agree Mr. Bush needs to do a better job
in defining the country's mission in the Persian Gulf.
   Especially striking is the panelists' belief that the
events unfolding in the Middle East are more apt to divide
the Republicans than the Democrats.
   "In the war in Vietnam," notes Mr. Baron, "we were
fighting communists, and Russia was on the other side. We
don't have that here, and Russia's on our side." What's
happening, says Mr. Baron, is that the Republican Party is
splitting along one of its oldest divides -- "between
right-wing isolationism and old-fashioned, Thomas Dewey
Republicanism."
   "Obviously," says Mr. Schneiders, "the lack of a communist
element in this makes it more difficult for Republicans, and
the result is the political landscape gets that more
confusing."
   Republicans are also dividing on other questions, says Mr.
Phillips -- abortion, taxes, religion, the environment. It's
happening after 25 years in which most of the divisiveness
took place inside the Democratic Party, where, Mr. Phillips
believes, "divisions are actually being mitigated."
   The Journal's experts agree that New York's Gov. Cuomo is
the likely nominee in 1992. "Even if events developed that
encouraged others to jump in, he's helped by the fact he's
not from Washington," says Mr. Schneiders. "And he's got $10
million or $12 million in the bank."
   Mr. Baron argues that Mr. Cuomo would run forcefully in
the Democratic primaries and caucuses if President Bush
remained popular, because "the kind of people who participate
would be looking for someone to run on moralistic-sounding
issues. That fires them up."
   Mr. Phillips argues that even in the event of a
hair-curling recession, Mr. Cuomo would run well because he
"has the sort of neo-New Deal policies that are likely to be
salable."
   Of the four panelists, only Mr. Phillips believes there is
any faint possibility that Mr. Bush would dump his vice
president in 1992. "You've got an international crisis," he
says. "The whole notion that Dan Quayle should be within a
city block, to say nothing of a heartbeat, to the presidency
is disturbing to people." Mr. Phillips thinks it might happen
if Mr. Bush figured he was in a close contest.
   "The big problem is trying to decide who his replacement
is," says Mr. Baron. "That's the trouble," says Mr. Sears.

   FILIPINOS IN THE MIDEAST

<TEXT>
   While thousands of Filipinos are fleeing the Persian Gulf
area, thousands more are still flocking to the Mideast
searching for jobs.
   Over the last year, an average of 15,000 Filipinos a month
left for jobs in the Gulf area, and that figure still holds
true despite the crisis precipitated by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, according to the state-run Philippine Overseas
Employment Agency. Chartered jets that recently flew hundreds
of refugees home from Jordan have been returning to the
Mideast packed with new job-seekers.
   Statistics show why Filipinos leave families behind to
work in the Mideast. The Philippine unemployment rate stands
at more than 8% and is expected to increase. Before the
crisis, an estimated 90,000 Filipinos were working in Kuwait
and Iraq; about 16,500 have returned to the Philippines.
   President Corazon Aquino's government has promised to help
workers who fled Kuwait and Iraq find other jobs abroad. But
fewer than 100 of the workers who have come home have found
new jobs overseas through government efforts.
                                                                                                       

   HELPING FRENCH FARMERS
                                                                                                       

   France's farm bank Credit Agricole has agreed to set aside
a large amount of money to help farmers restructure their
debts. Last week, government ministers warned the formerly
state-owned bank that it could lose lucrative privileges if
it didn't do more for the farmers, who have been hit by
drought and a fall in meat prices. Now the bank has said it
will raise its earlier offer of 200 million francs ($38.2
million) by 1.4 billion francs. This money, to be paid over
three years, will be placed in a new fund to help the
worst-hit farmers restructure their debts.
                                                                                                       

   SOUVENIRS OF A JOINT VENTURE
                                                                                                       

   Soviet customs authorities said they had seized 22
paintings, some stolen from Leningrad's Hermitage gallery,
and other valuables as they were being transported to West
Germany. The haul, valued at about $1.8 million, was seized
by officials in Lithuania. The Tass news agency, quoting
customs officials, said the haul included icons, coins, gold
and silver objects and a large amount of rubles and dollars.
It said the haul was being moved by an employee of a joint
venture who was heading for West Germany. It did not give the
nationality of the employee.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREA SHOPS ABROAD
                                                                                                       

   South Korea will choose a foreign contractor by next June
for its first high-speed electric-train service, projected to
begin in 1998. Transportation Minister Kim Chang Shik said
South Korea needs to obtain foreign high technology for the
train service linking Seoul with the port city of Pusan.
France, West Germany and Japan reportedly have been lobbying
for the project, which Mr. Kim said would cost an estimated
$8.1 billion.
                                                                                                       

   SOVIETS MAKE A PAYMENT
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. and three other Japanese
steelmakers decided to resume production of steel pipes for
export to the Soviet Union, a Japanese news agency reported,
quoting industry sources. The decision came after the Soviet
Union paid Japanese trading companies $207 million for its
steel imports. The four companies suspended production of the
pipes in late May because they hadn't received any payment
since the beginning of the year.
                                                                                                       

   ITALY'S ANTITRUST LAW
                                                                                                       

   Italy's first antitrust law cleared its last hurdle when
it won Senate approval. The measure, which brings Italy into
line with regulations laid down recently by the European
Community, is designed to ensure free-competition principles
and prohibit the formation of monopolies or agreements among
companies that create dominant market positions.
                                                                                                       

   AID FOR EAST GERMANY
                                                                                                       

   The European Community said it would give 20 million
European currency units ($26.2 million) to East Germany to
help the country tackle its environmental problems.
   Announcing an aid package worth a total of 35 million ECUs
for East Germany, the EC said it would, for the moment at
least, continue to give aid to East Germany even though the
country will cease to exist after Oct. 3.
   The EC said years of reliance on heavy and chemical
industries, coupled with the burning of low-grade coal, has
left East Germany with one of the most polluted environments
in Europe. Only 42% of the population has access to an
adequate sewerage system, the EC said.

million children still die from these diseases each year, and
some two million are disabled, WHO said. . . . Italy's

   Plans to Market
   PCs in Early '91

   Venture Formed With Acer
   To Sell Home Computer
   Priced `Competitively'

   NEW CANAAN, Conn. -- After years of resisting market
pressures to develop personal computers, Smith Corona Corp.
is finally taking the plunge.
   The maker of electronic typewriters and personal word
processors said it formed a joint venture with the U.S. arm
of Taiwan-based Acer Group to develop and market personal
computers, expected to be on the market in early 1991.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're extending our product line at the right time, just
as the home and small computer market is taking off," said G.
Lee Thompson, chairman and chief executive officer of Smith
Corona.
   Indeed, the home and small office segment of the personal
computer market is considered the fastest growing in the
computer industry. According to LINK Resources Corp. a
market-research firm, the number of U.S. households with a
personal computer is growing 10% a year.
   Smith Corona is hoping to tap into that potentially
lucrative market with the help of a company that is already a
major player in the personal computer industry. Acer, a maker
of IBM-compatible computers, is Taiwan's largest computer
maker, with more than $700 million in revenue. It also has a
network of 10,000 dealers in more than 70 countries.
   But Smith Corona is also leaping into what is becoming an
increasingly crowded business environment. International
Business Machines Corp. and Tandy Corp., both eyeing a
potentially huge growth market, announced this summer new
computers aimed at the home market. IBM's PS/1 lists for
$1,000 to $2,000 while Tandy's 1000RL sells for $750 to
$1,300.
   "It's a crowded market, but it's also a market that
unlikely competitors have had success," says G. Barry Nelson,
analyst with Louis Nicoud &amp; Associates. "So I wouldn't write
them off."
   In development for about a year, Smith Corona said the
computers will be sold under the Smith Corona/Acer brand
name, taking advantage of Smith Corona's brand awareness in
the U.S. and Acer's recognition overseas.
   Initially, the computers will be manufactured in Taiwan by
Acer. The later will be made in Smith Corona's Cortland,
N.Y., plant, where the company currently makes high-end word
processors.
   Although Smith Corona said that the computer would be able
to operate MSDOS application software, the most widely used
operating system for personal computers, it provided few
additional details about features and price other than to say
that the product would be "competitive." Smith Corona did not
indicate what type of computer processor, such as Intel's
Corp's 80286 or 80386, the computer would use.
   Addressing concerns raised by analysts, the company
maintained that the computer won't eat into its existing word
processor business. "Customers are still looking for
task-specific products," Mr. Thompson said. "The word
processor fills that demand."
   The home computer is a "evolutionary" extension of Smith
Corona's electronic typewriters and word processors, Mr.
Thompson added. Indeed, its higher-end models can do
virtually most functions that PCs can do, such as spell
checking and financial spreadsheets, and at a lower cost. Its
most expensive word processor lists for $599.
   But growth in that market, which fills a very specific
demand, has been slow and has been basically sustained by a
loyal following of high school students and people who work
at home. The company is hoping the latest venture will boost
its sluggish profit growth.
   Since going public last year, the company's stock has
plunged more than $17 a share, buffeted by lower than
expected earnings, foreign competition and sluggish demand
for its traditional products.
   Smith Corona went public in mid-1989; it remains 47% owned
by Britain's Hanson PLC.

   LONDON -- Malaysian financier Tan Sri Khoo Teck Puat has
boosted his stake in U.K.-based Standard Chartered Bank PLC
to 5.48%, a move that follows a sharp drop in its share price
on talk he had sold his holding.
   Tan Sri Khoo, who was among three prominent international
financiers drafted by Standard Chartered in 1986 to help it
fight off a potential bid by Lloyds Bank PLC, acquired
600,000 shares, Standard Chartered said in a statement to the
London Stock Exchange.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The acquisition raised his total shareholding to
12,225,000 shares. His previous stake had stood at 5.04% of
the bank's issued share capital.
   A Standard Chartered spokesman added that "we're not aware
of his motives for the purchase."
   U.K. equity dealers saw the acquisition largely as
opportunistic, noting that the bank's share price fell more
than 10% in rumor-driven trading Wednesday. Dealers noted
that unconfirmed rumors had driven the share price down. The
rumors included speculation over future profitability and
dividends and talk that Tan Sri Khoo had sold his stake in
the bank.

   NEW YORK -- The Bloomingdale's department store chain
received court permission to proceed with a new store at the
Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn.
   Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. made his ruling in U.S.
bankruptcy court in Ohio. His approval was necessary because
Bloomingdale's, together with the Federated and Allied retail
units of Campeau Corp., Toronto, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law protection Jan. 15.

   "We're very excited. You can't deny the magic of their
name," said Herbert Simon, president of Melvin Simon &amp;
Associates Inc., Indianapolis. He is in charge of daily
operations at the mall, expected to open in September 1992.
The $625 million project is a joint venture between
affiliates of Melvin Simon &amp; Associates and Triple Five Corp.
of Edmonton, Alberta.
   Separately, Judge Aug ruled that attorneys for the Allied
Stores Corp. bondholders committee could conduct a
fact-finding interview, or deposition, with former Campeau
Chairman Robert Campeau. The issue will be heard by a court
in Ontario.
   Attorneys for bondholders want to question Mr. Campeau in
connection with a suit for fraudulent conveyance they hope to
file against Federated Stores Inc., Campeau Corp. and other
parties involved in Allied's sale of Ann Taylor and Brooks
Brothers. The bondholders want to recover between $700
million and $1 billion they say belongs to Allied and its
creditors.
   Judge Aug hasn't ruled on whether he will allow the
bondholders to sue.
   An attorney for Mr. Campeau said he didn't know how his
client would respond to the ruling.

   Iraq Can Survive Winter

   WASHINGTON -- A Congressional Research Service study says
Iraq can survive the winter's embargoes by shifting to a
vegetarian diet, rationing food and smuggling in whatever it
can.
   The assessment came as Baghdad announced its intentions to
cut off food to non-Arabs and extend rationing to rice,
flour, sugar, tea and cooking oil. Bread has been rationed
since Sept. 1.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a report to Congress, an agriculture-policy analyst for
the Library of Congress's research arm said Iraq's chances of
holding out against trade sanctions depend largely on how
quickly it turns toward subsistence farming and substitutes
domestic crops for food imports. Until its invasion of
Kuwait, Iraq imported 75% of its food, including feed grain
for egg and poultry production.
   "Locally grown potatoes can be substituted for imported
rice," the analyst, Susan Epstein, said. "Locally grown dates
can be pressed to obtain a sweetener to replace imported
sugar, and locally grown barley can replace imported wheat
for bread." In addition, the Iraqis can switch to beans and
lentils as a protein alternative to meat, she said.
   Shortages, Ms. Epstein said, will be offset somewhat by a
fall harvest of vegetables and the slaughter of livestock as
farmers run out of feed grain. Iraqi farmers will begin
planting their barley and wheat crops next month, for harvest
in May and June. In the meantime, rationing of dwindling
wheat and rice stockpiles must be strictly enforced.
   Over the long term, Ms. Epstein said, efforts to increase
production will be limited by the lack of seed and
farm-equipment parts and the exodus of foreign technicians
who had repaired irrigation rigs.

from a year earlier.
   For the first eight months of the year, the industry group
estimated that consumption rose 1% to 8,034,531 metric tons.
A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.

   The association said U.S. daily newspapers used 735,722
metric tons of newsprint in August, slightly lower than
742,642 metric tons used a year earlier. Daily newspapers'
consumption in the first eight months was little changed at
5,980,211 metric tons.
   Newsprint inventories of newspapers in the association's
statistical sample averaged a 41-day supply in August,
compared with a 40-day supply a year earlier. The association
said stocks of North American mills were down 17%.
   The association said Canadian newsprint mills operated at
90% of rated capacity in August and at 94% in the first eight
months. U.S. mills operated at 98.7% in August and at 97.1%
in the year-to-date.

   Julia Goes to Oxford

   Oxford, England -- This pleasant university town has
always relished its visits from American notables. The big
noise last academic year was Stephen Sondheim's stint as the
brand-new professor of drama. Just before the beginning of
the university term this autumn, Oxford had a visit from
Julia Child.
   America's best-known television cook was here to attend
what may well have been the 10th Oxford Symposium on Food.
(There is a question as to whether to count the first meeting
in 1979, as it was not open to the public.) The symposiums --
organized by Alan Davidson, a former British ambassador to
Laos who is now writing the several-million-word "Oxford
Companion to Food," and Theodore Zeldin, the eminent
historian of France and star of French television -- have
been copied and emulated all over the globe, from Turkey to
Norway and from Sydney to Boston.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Eccentricity is the hallmark of the Oxford meeting. Past
symposiasts have been treated to a lecture in which an
archaeologist claimed to have found the first loaf of bread
ever baked; to a taste of the soup Count Rumford invented to
feed the obstreperous professional beggars of Bavaria whose
demands were undermining the social order; to accounts of
cannibalism replete with tasting notes on the flesh of
different races; and to learned disquisitions on the origins
of cooking vessels, table manners, food taboos, nutritional
fads and farming practices. The participants take an especial
delight in apparent pedantry; for the most specific, arcanely
titled, off-the-wall papers almost always turn out to be the
most exciting and interesting.
   Connoisseurs remember the paper delivered by Charles
Perry, once a rock-music journalist, on medieval Persian
rotted condiments, which were lethal to consume. Mr. Perry
appeared again this year, but his learned and literate
disquisition on "Elements of Arab Feasting," though not
disappointing, lacked the night-of-the-living-dead luridness
of his classic performances.
   "Feasting and Fasting" was the theme of this year's
meeting, and, true to form, contributions on "The Way the
Contemporary Western Assyrians Take Food in the Middle East
During Fasts and Church Holidays" and "Fasting and Feasting
among Oregon's Russian Old Believers" were among the most
stirring. Mrs. Child (who had begun her first visit to the
Oxford Symposium with a dinner at Oxfordshire's best
restaurant, Raymond Blanc's Manoir aux Quat' Saisons) seemed
particularly amused by the paper on "The Black or Hell
Banquet," presented by Phyllis P. Bober of Bryn Mawr College.
   But the great event for Mrs. Child, as for everyone else
who attended the session, was the very last paper, "The
Bayeux Tapestry Sish-Kebab Mystery," by Robert Chenciner, an
associate member of St. Antony's College, the perennial site
of the symposium. Mr. Chenciner, by profession a financial
consultant, also is an art historian specializing in carpets
and ancient textiles. His interest in food is purely
avocational.
   He set himself the subject of examining the panel in the
Bayeux Tapestry (actually "a wool embroidery on fine linen
tabby," which is a fabric in plain weave) -- depicting an
11th-century Norman feast. Mr. Chenciner was at first
intrigued by the fact that "one of the cooks is looking after
shish kebabs of meat cubes and small fowl, spread out like a
spring chicken, being grilled over a box-shaped container
with three shelves and rings protruding on each side of the
top supported by a low (about eight-inch) tripod over a
fire."
   This barbecue was Mr. Chenciner's first puzzle. How had
kebabs traveled from the Near East to Norman France and
England? As other symposium participants quickly pointed out
(and as Mr. Chenciner was clearly aware), the kebabs were a
red herring. Since cooking bits of meat on a stick over an
open fire was almost certainly the chief culinary standby of
primitive man, one cannot assume that, because the technique
is at present associated with the Middle East, it must have
originated there.
   Indeed, as Mr. Chenciner made clear, the kebabs soon
became merely an excuse for discussing the embroidery itself
in front of a conclave of gastronomes. By a series of elegant
arguments, he prepared his audience for the bombshell he then
dropped. Everyone who has ever seen the Bayeux Tapestry has
remarked on how fresh, even new, it looks, and on its good
state of repair.
   The reason for this, Mr. Chenciner argued cogently, is
that it is a modern copy, probably made in the early 18th
century about 1710, and possibly incorporating the original
tapestry. There is no outline drawing in the Bayeux Tapestry,
"just pricked through holes,"Mr. Chenciner points out, "a
usual method of copying, though not necessarily of designing
embroidery." This led him to speculate that the original
might have been mounted onto the linen backing and used as a
template for the copy.
   Despite the lack of slide-projection equipment (as well as
amplification, which caused Mrs. Child, a daughter of
Southern California, to remark that the "production values"
of the symposium could have been higher), Mr. Chenciner's
remarks achieved the dramatic effect intended, and the
audience was electrified.
   It was duly noted that the authorities have thus far
refused to allow the Bayeux Tapestry to be carbon-dated, a
fact that seemed outrageous to veteran symposiast Nicholas
Kurti, emeritus professor of physics at Oxford.
   After it was all over, I asked Mrs. Child -- who had been
a guest of honor at the symposium, and who had made a brief
and charming speech at the Saturday-night dinner that
featured English food (with a main course of boiled mutton)
-- if she had enjoyed the proceedings. "I have never," she
replied in her familiar, slightly breathless voice,
"experienced a conference quite like this." Lest this be open
to misinterpretation, she immediately added, "and I am
definitely coming back next year."

   Some Imports Bucking
   Dwindling Sales Trend

   THANKS TO clever marketing, some foreign brewers are
managing to swim against a receding tide of U.S. sales by
imports.
   For the second year running, sales of imported beers are
declining, down 2.7% through May compared with the same
period last year, according to Beer Marketer's Insights.
   But sales of Warsteiner, Germany's largest-selling beer,
rose 28% in the first half, without advertising. Its sales
are still dwarfed by Heineken, the No. 1 import. But
Warsteiner, which came to the U.S. in 1983 through Warsteiner
Importers Agency in Denver, projects sales will reach 320,000
cases this year, up 34% from about 239,000 last year.
   Warsteiner enters its markets with sales of drafts at posh
locations, hoping to build package sales from such sampling
at bars and restaurants. Most importers go straight to the
supermarket.
   Grolsch has also gained ground, with sales up 12.2% to
750,000 cases through August, compared with the same period
last year, estimates Jim Gollhofer, president of Grolsch
Importers, a unit of Grolsch Breweries of the Netherlands.
   As other imports have slumped, Grolsch has beefed up its
sales force to increase the number of contacts it makes with
beer distributors, who are responsible for putting beer on
trucks and store shelves. And the company has reduced its TV
ads in favor of print ads in upscale magazines more likely to
reach its target audience, says Mr. Gollhofer.
                                                                                                       

   Marketing May Explain
   Alcohol-Labeling Push
                                                                                                       

   DOES THE PUSH by G. Heileman Brewing to require the
disclosure of alcohol content on beer labels have as much to
do with marketing as the public's right to know?
   Heileman is lobbying for the requirement in states across
the country, despite opposition by federal and state
governments, which fear that it might encourage people to buy
more potent beer. Heileman's aim may be just the opposite.
Heileman brews two of the five U.S. beers with the least
alcohol, Rainier Light and Henry Weinhard's Light, and may
see this as an advantage in marketing to today's
health-conscious consumers. Its other brands include Old
Style, Schmidt, Lone Star, Blatz and Special Export.
   Last month, the La Crosse, Wis., brewer finally struck pay
dirt when the Washington state liquor commission decided to
require the percentage of alcohol to be printed on all malt
beverage labels. Washington state, where Heileman has a 30%
market share, was a logical place for the brewer to take a
high-profile stand on the issue. Washington is Heileman's
second-biggest market, largely due to its Rainier brand.
Rainier's light version has an alcohol content of 2.6%, while
the regular version has 4.6%. Heileman's sales, however, have
been declining there, down about 7% through May of this year
from the same period last year.
   But a company spokesman insists Heileman's motive in
making the labeling push is that President Murray Cutbush,
who hails from Australia, grew up with alcohol labeling and
thinks the public has a right to know how much alcohol is in
each beer.
   Other big brewers are split. Adolph Coors, which says it
"philosophically" agrees with Heileman, won't join the
state-by-state fight, calling that an "inefficient" approach.
Miller Brewing and Anheuser-Busch are opposed.
                                                                                                       

   Brewers Are Cultivating
   Environmental Image
                                                                                                       

   GREEN MARKETING has become big with brewers.
   Miller Brewing sponsors the "Sack It To Me Saturday"
citywide cleanup every spring in Milwaukee. And Canada's
Moosehead Breweries donates money to the National Fish and
Wildlife Foundation in the U.S. But some environmental
do-gooding seems to be aimed at atoning for brewers' own
environmental ills.
   The most obvious example is Adolph Coors, which is under
criminal investigation by the state of Colorado for dumping
contaminated water from a well under its can plant into a
nearby creek. The company's water pollution problem convinced
Coors officials its environmental spending should go to a
water pollution cleanup effort, a spokesman says. As noted in
the company's television commercials, Coors gave $1 million
to Pure Water 2000, which backs hundreds of projects across
the country and is run by Robert Redford's Institute for
Resource Management. The company also agreed recently to
sponsor a Hudson River pollution patrol boat run by
riverkeeper John Cronin.
   Then there's Anheuser-Busch's $5 million contribution to
the Don't Mess With Texas campaign, a state anti-litter
project. About 40 beer and other beverage cans and bottles
litter every mile of Texas highways, says Dan Syrek of the
Institute for Applied Research. Still, the brewer's grant
outweighs its contribution to litter, he says. "They're doing
more than their fair share."
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends:
                                                                                                       

   COORS receives the first kosher approval ever granted an
American beer. . . . After six months in Tulsa, Okla.,
Anheuser-Busch still isn't ready to expand its one-city test
of Busch Cold-Filtered Draft. . . . Beer's percentage of
alcohol business rose to 56.5% in 1989 from 50.2% in 1979,
Beer Marketer's Insights says.

   WYOMISSING, Pa. -- VF Corp., hurt by substantially lower
orders and shipments in its Lee jeans division, said
financial results for the third and fourth quarters will be
"well below recent estimates."
   The apparel maker expressed "serious concerns about
general economic and industry conditions." The company said
current sluggishness appears to be linked to a decline in
sales for jeans during the back-to-school season. Business at
other VF divisions "appears to be meeting expectations," the
company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company also indicated that fourth-quarter results
would suffer from the slump even more than third-quarter
performance. VF didn't say what its recent estimates for the
third and fourth periods had been, and wouldn't specify its
revised estimates.
   In the year-ago third quarter the company earned $52
million, or 80 cents a share, on sales of $695.4 million.
   VF said several alternatives are being explored to respond
to the unexpected shortfall. The company didn't elaborate.

   30% in 1990's 1st Half;

   PARIS -- Cie. Financiere de Paribas said consolidated
profit jumped 30% in the first half of 1990, largely on the
strength of capital gains on its portfolio of securities and
real estate.
   The French bank and financial holding company said
consolidated profit after payments to minority interests rose
to 2.49 billion francs ($474.7 million), or 39.10 francs a
share, from 1.91 billion francs ($364.5 million), or 35.50
francs a share, in the first half of 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Paribas said the rise was led by capital gains and
dividends from minority-held industrial affiliates. A company
official said much of the increase came from the sale of an
office building in Paris for a pretax capital gain of 1.3
billion francs.
   On the other hand, income from traditional banking
operations and dividends from financial units fell to 168
million francs from 1.04 billion francs a year earlier.
Paribas said one reason was heavy spending on new portfolio
investment, profit from which was recorded as securities
income. It didn't give details of the new investment,
although an official suggested that much of it came in a 2.7
billion franc outlay for 54% of the French food group
Guyomarch S.A. in February.
   The group's main bank units, Banque Paribas, Credit du
Nord and Cie. Bancaire, generated profit of 1.06 billion
francs, up 15%. The rise included the 1.3 billion franc
pretax capital gain on the Paris real estate sale, which was
made by Banque Paribas. The company said Credit du Nord and
Cie. Bancaire posted small profit gains but didn't disclose
details.
   Otherwise, it said profitability in the banking sector was
held back by rising interest rates and efforts to boost
provisions for loan risks. Paribas said new provisions for
the first half totaled 2.3 billion francs, compared with 1.8
billion in the first half of 1989. It didn't make any new
provisions for its sovereign, or government, debt exposure,
which is covered by insurance it took out last year.
   Profit from Paribas's non-banking units, mostly in the
portfolio sector, rose 43% in the first half to 1.43 billion
francs.

   Goldman Secures
   Capital to Invest
   In Troubled Firms

MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- In the latest sign of Wall Street's rush to
profit from companies in financial distress, Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co. said it finished raising a $750 million fund that will
invest in troubled corporations.
   Goldman's fund is the second biggest of more than 20
"restructuring" or "turnaround" investment pools being raised
this year, according to pension consultants. The Goldman
fund, known as Water Street Recovery Fund I, is exceeded in
size only by a $1 billion pool raised earlier this year by
Chicago investors Samuel Zell and David Schulte.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Goldman figures there is plenty of money to be made from
turnaround investing. In the four years prior to setting up
the Water Street fund, the firm says it made 22 investments
of its own in distressed companies' bonds, bank debt or
equity, usually at cut-rate prices. Eleven of those
investments produced annual returns of 35% or better, says
Goldman partner Mikael Salovaara. Mr. Salovaara is managing
the new fund.
   In a memo to investors, the Water Street fund states that
it is seeking annual returns of 25% to 35%. If that goal is
achieved, Goldman will benefit richly. Goldman has $100
million of its own money in the fund; it also is entitled to
as much as 20% of the profits earned by its other investors,
which include corporate pension funds, university endowments
and foreign banks, mostly Japanese.
   Running the Water Street fund, however, may clash with
Goldman's reputation of doing friendly work for blue-chip
clients. Turnaround investing often requires tough tactics,
such as pressuring managers of ailing companies to quit or
liquidate their businesses.
   In its investors' memo, however, Goldman itself notes that
conflicts of interest with existing clients may limit
Goldman's ability to pursue some investments.
   In previous investing for its own account, Goldman scored
a coup in 1988 and 1989 by buying junk bonds of Fruehauf
Corp. at 60 cents on the dollar. Goldman successfully pressed
Fruehauf to sell its major trailer-making unit and was able
to cash out its bond position at nearly 90 cents on the
dollar.
   In previous investing for its own account, Goldman scored
a coup in 1988 and 1989 by buying junk bonds of Fruehauf
Corp. at about 65 cents on the dollar. Goldman successfully
pressed Fruehauf to sell its major trailer-making unit and
was able to cash out its bond position at nearly 90 cents on
the dollar.
   One of Goldman's best-known turnaround plays, however, has
backfired. The firm in early 1989 bought a one-third equity
stake in Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp., a steelmaker operating
under bankruptcy-law protection. Goldman paid $8 a share; the
stock currently trades at $3.50. "We made a mistake," Mr.
Salovaara concedes. Goldman should have bought debt in
Wheeling-Pittsburgh first, before buying equity, he says.
   In the past few months, Mr. Salovaara says, Goldman has
already invested $195 million of the Water Street fund,
primarily buying junk bonds at 40% to 50% of their face
value.
   Both the U.S. economy and the market for distressed
companies' securities probably have "a ways further to go
down," Mr. Salovaara says. But he contends that by careful
buying, he can pick out profitable investments even in a
slumping market.
   Others aren't so sure. Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
mergers chief Leon Black, who this summer raised a $400
million fund that can make turnaround investments, says he is
inclined to wait six to nine months before putting much of
his money to work. With oil prices soaring, the economy
weakening, and bank stocks in free-fall, "it's pretty scary
now," Mr. Black says.

   Loses McElligott

   NEW YORK -- In another blow to Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc., Thomas
McElligott quit yesterday as executive vice president and
executive creative director to open his own advertising
agency in Minneapolis.
   Mr. McElligott, a highly regarded but eccentric creative
executive who cofounded Minneapolis's Fallon McElligott
agency, was brought in to Chiat just nine months ago to
oversee creative work in the New York office, as well as its
offices in Toronto and London. Chiat's headquarters are in
Venice, Calif.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   His departure comes at a difficult time for the agency,
which is defending the $30 million to $35 million Royal
Caribbean Cruise Line Inc. account. That account is under
review, and Chiat has pulled out all the stops to save the
business. In an unusual move the agency offered up Mr.
McElligott to personally act as the top creative executive on
the account.
   Mr. McElligott couldn't be reached yesterday. In a
statement, he didn't discuss his reasons for leaving, but
said he felt it was a good time to start his own agency. And
in an interview yesterday, Jay Chiat, chairman and chief
executive officer, said Mr. McElligott told him that he
wanted to live in Minneapolis once again and run his own
shop.
   "He had pretty much made up his mind to start an agency
and he was getting somewhat concerned about getting more and
more deeply involved here," Mr. Chiat said.
   Mr. McElligott did help to bring in a couple of clients to
Chiat's Toronto operations, but he failed in his bid to win
the $13 million Haagen-Dazs account for the New York office,
which earlier this week was awarded to BBDO, the only other
competitor. Meanwhile, the shop lost many accounts and fired
numerous staffers.
   Mr. McElligott, 47 years old, will now be chairman and
creative director of a new agency, called McElligott Wright
Morrison White. Two partners, Tony Wright, 30, and Rob White,
34, are currently executives at Chiat. John Morrison, 38,
currently works at Carmichael Lynch, a Minneapolis agency.
   "We simply are going to make very smart ads . . . and we
hope to make them for very smart advertisers," said Mr.
Morrison, who said the new shop will open Nov. 1. He said he
and his partners want the agency, although based in
Minneapolis, to become regarded as a national agency. "We
will go where the work is," he said.
   Mr. Morrison said the agency doesn't yet have any clients.
   Mr. Chiat said Mr. McElligott won't be replaced, but that
Lee Clow, the shop's president who shared the executive
creative director title with Mr. McElligott, will hold that
position alone.
   Mr. Chiat said he will now devote even more time to the
New York operations, having recently been spending most of
his time building a European network. "I plan to be much more
active in the agency's operations," he said. "We've just got
to get some new business in here."

   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange barred 12 people
from the securities industry for alleged violations of
exchange rules and federal securities laws.
   The NYSE charged that John Joseph Leadem of Normandy
Beach, N.J., a former broker at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., stole
$250,000 from a customer. Also barred was Joseph Patrick
Michael Desposito of Brooklyn, N.Y. The exchange alleged that
he stole funds from Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co., where he was an
assistant controller.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Eight individuals consented to a bar from the securities
industry, but didn't admit or deny wrongdoing: Michael R.
Freglette, Marietta, Ga.; Ralph Edgar Howard, Daly City,
Calif.; Amen S. Kahwajy, Richmond, Va.; Laurel Darlyne Lopez,
Waco, Texas; Michael John Pavkovich, Flint, Mich.; Michaele
P. Quinn, Winnetka, Ill.; Dorothy Kay Smith, Olympia, Wash.;
and James F. Wallace, Akron, Ohio.
   Two others, Harvey M. Bassin of Miami and Mark Muenster of
Clifton, N.J., were barred until they provide information the
exchange has requested.
   Four firms settled Big Board charges without admitting or
denying wrongdoing: Ferris, Baker Watts Inc., Washington;
Financial Clearing &amp; Services Corp. and Lepercq, De Neuflize
Securities Inc., both New York, and Rose &amp; Co. Investment
Brokers, Chicago. Financial Clearing was fined $45,000, while
the three others were assessed $20,000 each.
   The exchange took disciplinary action against a number of
individuals. Suspensions and fines are noted:
   Richard Baker Lohrer Jr., New York, 10 years; Thomas Lewis
Desmond Jr., Louisville, Ky., and Richard A. Wilburn, New
York, 30 months each; Robert M. Fanning, Newport Beach,
Calif., 18 months; and Lynn T. Shaw, Memphis, Tenn., one
month.
   The following neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing:
   Michael S. Penfield, Billings, Mont., six years; Timothy
Harrington, Grenada Hills, Calif., three years; Ronald Harry,
Salt Lake City, one year; Robert Leslie Fell, Mineola, N.Y.,
six months; John P. Aquino, Clifton Park, N.Y., five months;
Rodney Dee Aftuck, Atlanta, three months and must complete a
course.
   And Howard R. Knapp, Sanibel, Fla., five weeks; Steven J.
Aquino, Latham, N.Y., and Jeffrey Eric Susskind, Santa
Monica, Calif., each one month and $10,000; Bruce E.
Piccirillo, Robstown, Texas, two weeks and $5,000; Salvatore
Guerrieri Jr., North Chili, N.Y., one week; Andrew Racz, New
York, $25,000; and Thomas M. McDonald, Hudson, Ohio, and
Jeffrey M. Tauber, Darien, Conn., censure only.
   Except as noted below, the firms and individuals involved
in New York Stock Exchange disciplinary proceedings couldn't
be reached for comment.
   At Ferris Baker Watts, General Counsel Theodore Urban
referred to the exchange's remarks in the matter, which say
in part that the firm's failure to fully comply with an NYSE
rule "reflected a systems-related problem at the firm's
clearing broker," and that the firm's "procedures in place
are adequate to handle the normal stream of {account}
transfers within the specified time frame." He said that at
any firm handling a large volume of account transfers, "there
are going to be slip-ups," and that the exchange hasn't
spelled out a standard of how many such errors might be
acceptable.
   Mr. Susskind said, "It was something that took place years
ago. It's unfortunate that it took so long to get it
resolved. I'm happy that it's been resolved."
   Messrs. Penfield and Harry and Ms. Quinn declined comment.

   Windows Tips
   Software Firms'
   Power Balance

<LP>
   The rapid acceptance of a new version of Microsoft Corp.'s
Windows is changing the balance of power in the $6.5 billion
business of supplying software applications for personal
computers.
   Windows is expanding the domain of Microsoft while
constraining the growth of Lotus Development Corp. and
WordPerfect Corp., currently the two largest applications
suppliers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Microsoft's Windows program adds a set of graphical
commands to DOS, the basic software that controls the
operations of International Business Machines Co.'s personal
computers and compatibles. Instead of controlling
applications through keystrokes and strings of letters, users
of Windows can choose commands from menus and point at icons
to launch operations, such as a picture of scissors standing
for a command to delete information. However, new
applications -- such as spreadsheets or word processing
programs -- are required to take full advantage of Windows.
   Lotus and WordPerfect were caught without their flagship
products tailored to the new version of Windows when
Microsoft introduced it in May. Now they are starting to pay
a price as sales of both Windows and Microsoft's applications
for it are taking off.
   "They're losing some of the new market for applications
because they didn't realize how important Windows would be or
how quickly it would catch on," said Andrew Seybold, an
analyst at Dataquest Inc., a market researcher. Both Lotus
and WordPerfect say they'll ship Windows versions of their
most popular applications in the first half of next year.
   WordPerfect, which supplies the most popular DOS word
processing program, acknowledges that it is losing business
because it lacks a Windows version of its word-processing
program. "Windows is taking away incremental growth we would
have had through the end of the year," said Willard E.
Peterson, executive vice president at WordPerfect, a closely
held firm that expects $425 million in revenue this year.
   Mr. Peterson added that he believes he can regain lost
share with a solid Windows product next year, but "if we
should do a bad job, our sales will level off or drift down."
   Lotus, which has a networking product called Notes but
none of its popular spreadsheets on Windows, said it is too
soon to gauge the effect of Windows on its business. But Jim
Manzi, Lotus's chief executive officer, said "getting out our
Windows applications is the most important project at the
company."
   Other software suppliers without Windows applications also
are feeling the pressure.
   "It's very clear that every major account is evaluating
Windows, and they've all called me in to explain my Windows
strategy," said Fred Gibbons, chief executive officer at
Software Publishing Corp.
   Mr. Gibbons said his concern, one of the 10 largest
suppliers of PC software, plans in its coming fiscal year to
spend more money on Windows development than any other
applications projects. In the year ending Sunday, the company
spent virtually nothing on Windows development.
   With interest in Windows running high, companies that
offer Windows applications are drawing buy-out offers from
larger competitors. Earlier this year, for instance, Mr.
Gibbons offered to acquire Micrografx Inc., which supplies
two Windows graphics programs, for $80 million in stock,
according to J. Paul Grayson, Micrografx's chairman. Mr.
Grayson said he refused the offer and his firm later
completed a public stock offering. Mr. Gibbons declined to
comment.
   Some customers are so enthusiastic about Windows that
they've even stopped entertaining sales pitches from software
companies that don't offer Windows applications.
   "If a company doesn't have any Windows applications, I
don't even want them to visit," said Darrell Owen, who heads
an office automation group for the Bonneville Power
Administration in Portland, Ore. Mr. Owen said he recently
refused to see salespeople from Lotus and Ashton-Tate because
neither were peddling Windows applications.
   Prospects for a sea-change in the word processing and
spreadsheet markets -- the two biggest in PC applications --
isn't likely, however, provided Lotus, WordPerfect and other
suppliers of popular DOS applications can quickly deliver
Windows versions of their products. Most customers say they
don't want to abandon products with huge followings, but "the
day will come when we will switch vendors if Windows
applications aren't available," warns Sheldon Laube, national
director of information and technology at Price Waterhouse.
   A new study by International Data Corp. underscores this.
In a poll of 200 corporate PC users, the company found that
more than 60% plan to buy both word processing and
spreadsheet software tailored to Windows.
   In the meantime, Microsoft hopes to expand its own
applications business, which in recent years has grown more
rapidly than its bread-and-butter operating software
business. William Gates, Microsoft's chief executive, said
the company posted "a significant increase" in applications
sales in July and August, and he hopes to increase the
pressure on competitors next week by offering a bundle of
three Microsoft Windows applications at a 50% discount.
   Prior to the introduction of the new Windows version in
May, many Microsoft competitors were skeptical about its
prospects, asserting that OS/2 would emerge as a stronger
alternative. But in the past four months, Microsoft has
shipped more than one million copies of Windows while OS/2,
another Microsoft operating system, flounders. Last week,
IBM, one of the staunchest advocates of OS/2, even agreed to
license Windows.

<LP>
   CHICAGO -- The commercial printing industry, plagued by
overcapacity, is currently "very weak, fragile, and very
vulnerable," R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. Chairman John R.
Walter said.
   But the nation's largest commercial printer, protected to
an extent by its diversity, technical acumen and sheer size,
sees "significant opportunities" ahead, Mr. Walter added.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "All of our core businesses are growing," despite the
pinch of what appears to be "the roughest year in the
magazine industry in 25 years," Mr. Walter said.
   In an interview, the 43-year-old executive outlined his
efforts to boost Donnelley's international posture, and
talked about the once-staid concern's more aggressive
acquisition policy. Donnelly recently closed its biggest-ever
purchase, the $487.5 million acquisition of a printing joint
venture between Meredith Corp. and West Germany's Burda
family.
   Donnelley is bigger than its next three or four largest
competitors combined and historically has spent heavily on
technology. Those outlays, which initially drew criticism
from analysts who wanted to see the funds go to the company's
bottom line, are now paying off, Mr. Walter said.
   The industry has seen "more technological change in the
past five years than in the previous 50," he says. Those
changes "bode well for the industry" overall, but pose a
threat to those companies that are too small or financially
strapped to adopt the changes.
   Donnelley's size (1989 revenue of $3.12 billion) and its
solid balance sheet thus "can give an advantage" by
permitting the costly pursuit of technical enhancements, he
said.
   Mr. Walter is an unabashed booster of what he sees as
print's bright future as a medium, even in an era of
broadcast and computer-accessible information. "Successful
printing companies in the '90s won't simply put ink on paper.
. . . It's not a race to run printing presses faster," he
said. "We're in the business of delivering information. Our
real competition isn't other printers, but other media."
   Donnelley prints hard and softbound books, numerous
national magazines, catalogs and phone directories. In recent
years, it has also grown into the second-largest financial
printer in the U.S., and managed a profit, although the 1987
market crash turned that specialized market into a quagmire
for most other players.
   The softness in advertising that has badly hurt magazines
hurts Donnelley, too, Mr. Walter said. "That's a very strong
franchise for us, 17% to 18% of our revenue." But although "I
don't see {the current downturn} getting any better in the
next nine months," he remains "very optimistic" about the
magazine industry's future.
   Donnelley's technical push has produced its "Selectronic"
technology, which allows high-speed insertion of personalized
advertising or editorial content in catalogs or magazines.
The content can be targeted by demographic information culled
from Donnelley's extensive mailing-list database, or combined
with customer-supplied information.
   Donnelley is also fine-tuning a "print-on-demand"
technique that will permit textbook customers, such as
university professors, to customize book content.
   The moves are part of Mr. Walter's efforts to make
Donnelley more responsive to its customers' needs. By
decentralizing operations and trimming its work force, Mr.
Walter says Donnelly has "worked hard to change from a
manufacturing concern to a customer-service company."
   Donnelley is also pushing to achieve a more global
posture. Last year, it acquired an Irish printer to increase
its presence in Western Europe, and is currently building a
plant in Singapore. Donnelley is also constructing a plant in
Reynoso, Mexico, that will move it into the field of
professional and juvenile-book production, now dominated by
low-cost Asian printers.
   Donnelley's agreement to buy the Meredith-Burda joint
venture was announced late last year but had been stalled by
antitrust regulators' unsuccessful efforts to block the deal.
While analysts have interpreted the acquisition as signifying
a more aggressive acquisition posture for Donnelley under Mr.
Walter's leadership, the exescutive plays down the
significance of the acquisition in that respect.
   "In the first 115 years of this company's history," he
said, "we carried out one acquisition. But we've done 14 or
15 in the past 10 years." Donnelley sees "very good
opportunities for acquisitions" in the distressed industry,
Mr. Walter said. "We'll grow by buying or investing in new
assets," he said.

   Par Urges Holders
   To Rally Around
   New Management

DRUG MANUFACTURERS (DRG)

<LP>
   SPRING VALLEY, N.Y. -- Par Pharmaceutical Inc. is asking
shareholders to close ranks around its new managers and
directors as they try to reverse the company's fortunes.
   The generic-drug maker holds its first annual meeting in 2
1/2 years today. In that time, the generic-drug industry has
been rocked by a scandal involving illegal substitutions of
drugs for federal approval and payoffs to federal regulators.
Par and its Quad Pharmaceuticals subsidiary, caught in the
scandal, are pressing to re-establish their reputations and
get their products back to market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Par largely makes drugs taken orally and topical products.
Quad makes injectable drugs. They have a large product line
of generic equivalents of brand-name prescription drugs.
   The hurdles are numerous. Beginning in August 1989, Par
pulled almost all of its products off the market voluntarily
to review them. It has since reintroduced 70% to 75% of its
oral drugs and 15% to 20% of its injectables.
   Its 1989 annual report says it is among companies that are
barred from getting federal clearance on new drugs. And just
last Wednesday, Quad was barred from doing business with the
federal government until Aug. 31, 1992.
   Previously, Par and Quad were fined and some former
officers were convicted in connection with allegations of
payoffs to Federal Drug Administration inspectors in
Maryland. Quad admitted that it improperly changed certain
manufacturing processes. The federal investigation in
Maryland is continuing and a number of lawsuits alleging
racketeering and securities violations related to the
company's stock price.
   A year ago, amid all of this, Par revamped management,
with the aim of restoring the confidence of regulators and
investors in its products. It retained Kenneth I. Sawyer, an
attorney with experience in the generic-drug industry, to be
president and chief executive officer. And it later brought
in various executives to oversee product quality, regulatory
compliance and research and technology.
   Par also is asking shareholders to approve a number of
measures designed to ensure that management isn't disturbed
in its efforts to revitalize the company. The company says in
its proxy material, though, that it doesn't know of any
current efforts to take over Par.
   The company also seeks staggered terms for its directors,
which makes it more difficult for a hostile investor to take
control of the board. Previously, Par directors enacted a
poison-pill measure, and Mr. Sawyer has the right to vote
more than 19% of the company's shares, largely as a result of
proxies he received from major shareholders.
   Par is "highly vulnerable" to a takeover, says Hemant K.
Shah, analyst at HKS &amp; Co., Warren, N.J. "They have terrific
facilities in oral drugs and injectables," he says.
   The analyst adds, however, that Par still is "going to go
through some very difficult times." The company's inherent
value "doesn't mean it won't go down before it goes up," he
says.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Gannett Will Use Cross-Media Ads Again

   Gannett Co.'s first foray into the sale of cross-media
packages -- offering advertisers the chance to tap
simultaneously into its vast newspaper, television, radio and
billboard properties -- was a colossal failure in 1984.
   But now, five years after Gannett pulled the plug on the
plan, the media giant is gearing up to make another run at
the business. It has set up a task force to study the idea
and says it wants to have "a few" advertisers try the
cross-media program in 1991.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It was really an idea before its time," says Cathleen
Black, publisher of USA Today and executive vice president of
marketing at Gannett. "But we've had some internal
discussions, and we think it's time again to rethink this."
   But Gannett's idea isn't unique anymore, and it may find
that the market is already glutted with media companies that
have recently gotten into the cross-media ad package
business. Earlier this week, Washington Post Co.'s Newsweek
and Times Mirror Corp. announced a multimedia ad package.
Time Warner Inc., with its diverse interests from publishing
to cable TV, is also testing the waters, as is Hearst Corp.,
which owns magazines and the Lifetime cable network. Meredith
Corp. offers cross-media ad deals, too.
   Gannett, though, says its programs will be different
because its regional media outlets would allow advertisers to
target their messages at very narrow local segments.
Advertisers that sign up could tap its 10 TV stations, 15
radio stations, 83 newspapers, USA Today and its outdoor
billboard network. Ms. Black says the company might even link
with non-Gannett media, such as a magazine or in-store media,
if an advertiser wanted that.
   Still, some ad agency media directors aren't sure how big
a market there is for such deals. They warn that the programs
may appeal only to a very small group of big-spending
advertisers. And there are other concerns: "Media companies
have difficulty because they don't understand the needs of
the clients," says John Belfiore, senior vice president of
media planning services at ad agency BBDO.
   Gannett acknowledges that it stumbled the first time
because it forced advertisers to select from rigid ad
packages that Gannett itself created. One package, for
example, might have offered billboard and radio ads -- but
not TV. Now Gannett is demonstrating a flexibility common to
more and more media companies these days. Programs now will
be created one-on-one with advertisers, Gannett says.
   Ms. Black says Gannett decided to give the program a
second try in part because of interest from advertisers,
which said their marketing departments were facing cuts. The
advertisers, she says, were looking to Gannett and other
media companies not just for ad pages, but for marketing
advice.
   "We do know that the easier you make it for them, the
better your chance of selling a program," Ms. Black says. "In
this day and age, the closer you are to your customer's
thinking, the better off you will be in creating ideas and
programs that match their objectives."
   While Ms. Black touts the benefits of such packages, she
warns that advertisers who sign up won't get the big volume
discount some other programs offer. The program was primarily
developed, she says, to "get incremental dollars for
Gannett."
   Although they're taking a wait-and-see approach, some
media directors at ad agencies say corporate advertisers,
particulary the big spenders, might be interested in looking
into the packages if media companies can convince them that
they have the know-how to offer individualized, tailored
service.
   "The kinds of group deals or buys that were offered in the
past weren't flexible enough, and as a result, there wasn't
much business that grew out of them," says Rich Hamilton,
senior vice president at D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles. "The
media companies are recognizing the need to be more flexibile
. . . and that's a positive thing," he says.

   Alaska Launches Ad Blitz
                                                                                                       

   Do you think Alaska's shoreline is still awash in oil? The
Alaska Visitors Association, using $7 million from Exxon, is
mounting a TV ad blitz to convince you otherwise.
   The 30-second spots, which will run about 60 times a week
for four weeks, broke yesterday in 35 major markets. Each of
the three spots features new footage of Prince William Sound
-- and its mammal and marine life -- with no visible effects
from the Exxon Valdez spill last year. A typical line: "The
sapphire of Prince William Sound nearly recovered from the
spill."
   "Our research showed there is a substantial misperception
about the effects of the spill," says Robert Dindinger,
president of the 600-member trade association. "Nobody is
going to come to Alaska and see dead animals on the beach."
   Mr. Dindinger said the number of tourists visiting Alaska
has actually risen slightly since the spill. But that growth,
at an annual rate of 2% to 3%, is a far cry from the
double-digit growth the state had seen in the 1980s.
   Exxon, whose funding was termed voluntary by both parties,
shared creative control of the commercials. The oil company
"will benefit by dispelling misperceptions about conditions
in Prince William Sound," an Exxon spokesman said.

   European Car Sales
   Fell 3.4% in August;
   '90 Outlook Still Soft

   LONDON -- Car sales in Europe fell 3.4% to about 1,110,000
in August from 1,149,000 million a year earlier, largely
because of sluggish British demand, but rose 16% from 959,722
in July.
   The industry statistics are based on new-car registrations
in 12 countries that normally account for 94% of sales from
Western Europe. Analysts were reluctant to draw many
conclusions from August and its implications for the year
because of seasonal distortions in Britain. But they
generally stuck with earlier predictions that 1990 car sales
will range from unchanged to down 2% from 12.6 million units
in 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Britain, August sales surged more than eightfold to
432,867 from July, and though the total represented the
third-highest for the country, it was still down 13% from the
year-earlier record 500,112. Britain usually has a big
seasonal upswing in auto sales in August, as consumers there
try to buy cars at the start of the auto registration year.
   Had Britain's car sales been excluded from the
year-to-year total, European sales in August would have risen
4.3%.
   Also, August sales in Italy and France usually decline
from the previous month, as consumer interest fades at the
height of the summer holidays.
   "Of any one month of the year, August is the one you have
to be most careful about," as part of the measurement for the
year's trend, said Gavin Launder, a European car analyst at
Kleinwort Benson Securities Ltd.
   Analysts said the August data weren't influenced by the
rise in crude oil prices springing from the Persian Gulf
crisis. This effect might not be felt in the car market until
next year, Mr. Launder said, though production plans might be
reduced in this year's fourth quarter to prepare for an
economic downturn, owing to the oil factor.
   The West German market, where August sales climbed 16% to
224,088 cars from a year earlier, continues to be
"exceptionally strong," said Philip Ayton, European car
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. Recently released East
German savings continue to be sunk into the West German car
market, analysts said.
   Analysts also said France is among the main markets
bucking the trend and showing strength in the face of what
they expect will be a dismal year overall in Europe. French
sales continue to be helped by a reduction in taxes on new
cars. In the past three years, France has reduced taxes on
consumer goods to 22% from 28%; the latest cut took effect
this month. The tax cuts brighten the outlook for sales for
the rest of this year, analysts said. France's August sales
rose 3.6% to 178,500 from a year earlier but fell 22% from
July.

   Campbell Soup Director Quits Abruptly,
   Dimming Prospects of Takeover of Firm

   Dorrance "Dodo" Hamilton, the only director of Campbell
Soup Co. to have pushed publicly for a sale of the troubled
company, quit the board abruptly "for personal reasons."
   Her departure and other fresh developments appear likely
to reduce tensions among Dorrance family members, who
together own about 59% of Campbell's stock. The events also
dim the prospects for a takeover of Campbell, which has been
the target of Wall Street speculators ever since former
chairman John T. Dorrance Jr. died in April 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Today, Charles Norris Jr., another dissident, is expected
to disclose in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that he is resigning as a trustee of the dissident
group's block of Campbell shares, which constitutes a
combined 17.4% stake. Mr. Norris, husband of Mr. Dorrance's
niece Diana, is stepping down because of continuing marital
problems, according to family associates.
   Mrs. Hamilton, 62 years old, is a granddaughter of the
company's founder, and controls about 7% of Campbell's stock.
Her husband, Samuel, has been ill with emphysema for some
time.
   "She has been on the board for more than 10 years, and she
basically feels she's had enough," said a person close to
Mrs. Hamilton. The dissident group includes Mrs. Hamilton's
sister, Hope van Beuren, and her husband, as well as Mr.
Hamilton and the Norrises.
   Mrs. Hamilton's departure, effective next Monday, is a
symbolic blow to dissidents. Her seat will be filled by
Charles H. Mott, investment adviser to the van Beurens and
chief executive of John W. Bristol &amp; Co., a New York-based
investment management firm. Mr. Mott also is expected to be
named a trustee of the dissident stake, along with Mrs.
Hamilton.
   Her quitting the Campbell board "has to be viewed as a
modest negative for the takeover story," said John McMillin,
a food industry analyst for Prudential Bache Securities. "She
was the true flag waver among the dissidents, but she's no
longer in the right frame of mind to fight."
   But a spokesman for the dissidents said the fight would
continue through Mr. Mott. "The group feels that Mott will be
an effective advocate for the group's interests," the
spokesman said. "The position hasn't changed. It's just going
to be represented on the board by a professional money
manager."
   Campbell also announced the retirement of another
director, William S. Cashel Jr., the 70-year-old former
chairman of the company, who had an uneasy relationship with
some of the Dorrances for several years. Mr. Cashel's seat on
the 16-member board will be filled by Edmund M. Carpenter,
48, chairman and chief executive of General Signal Corp.,
based in Stamford, Conn.
   The confluence of these developments buys time for David
W. Johnson, Campbell's president and chief executive, who was
hired away from Gerber Products Co. in January to improve
Campbell's mediocre financial performance. Mr. Johnson has
vowed to keep the Camden, N.J., food company independent,
backed by the late Mr. Dorrance's three children and their
cousin George Strawbridge Jr.
   But Mr. Johnson may never preside over peace among the
Dorrances. A spokesman for the dissidents said they still
favor the ultimate sale of Campbell, despite their current
support of Mr. Johnson. And in another twist, the ill health
of Mr. Strawbridge, a family conciliator, may weaken the
prospects for a lasting harmony.
   Mr. Strawbridge, who was recently diagnosed with
intestinal cancer, is recovering from surgery at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Although his
prognosis is good, says a Campbell spokesman, Mr. Strawbridge
is still undergoing chemotherapy and is unlikely to play an
active role in company affairs for some time.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Campbell shares closed unchanged at $45.375.

   Will Castro Survive if Cuba Is Forced to Pay Its Bills?

   One cold day in January the news arrived at the Cuban
Embassy in Moscow: The Soviet government had decided that
beginning in 1991, all of Cuba's transactions with Comecon
members (the now-loose economic confederation of the U.S.S.R.
and Eastern Europe) would be conducted in hard currency and
at current world-market prices. A message was sent directly
to Fidel Castro, explaining the new terms. Mr. Castro
convened an urgent meeting with his principal economic
advisers, top party officials and some ministers.
   A tense and disgusted Mr. Castro said that the Soviets
would now join the capitalist countries in the exploitation
of the underdeveloped countries, and of course of Cuba. "We
have to discuss and convince them to concede special prices
and special terms of trade," he said. "But in the meantime we
have to be prepared for the worst: a virtual blockade of Cuba
-- now from our traditional friends."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   During Fidel Castro's 31-year reign, Soviet economic
assistance to Cuba has become the most important source of
supplies and financial support for his regime. More than
that, the trend and level of Soviet aid actually determine
the level of the Cuban economy. There are problems in trying
to determine the exact value of Soviet aid to Cuba in dollar
terms. The ruble has no real exchange rate vs. the dollar,
and Cuba has been applying an outdated price system
established in 1981. Thus, we can calculate only very rough
estimates in dollar terms. Because the Cuban gross national
product is undervalued, I would argue that Soviet assistance
represents about 25% of the Cuban economy -- less than other
estimates. Still, it's fair to say that without Soviet aid it
would be almost impossible for the Castro regime to survive.
   However difficult it is to fix an exact dollar amount on
Soviet aid to Cuba, the methods of delivery of Soviet aid and
how those delivery channels are being affected by changing
Soviet attitudes can be charted.
   -- The first and main source of Soviet aid is channeled
through so-called direct "commercial aid." This heading
refers to the preferential prices the Soviet Union pays for
the principal exports of Cuba -- raw sugar, citrus fruits and
nickel. These products receive higher prices than the current
world-market level. Of course, the main product is raw sugar,
for which the Soviets agreed to pay 950 rubles a ton in
1988-90.
   Cuba is supposed to deliver 4.4 million tons of sugar a
year. In fact, it has been unable to deliver this allotment
for the past three years because of inefficient domestic
production. This has forced Cuba to purchase large quantities
of sugar in the world market and deliver it to the Soviets.
Cuba also has been unable to fulfill the export agreements of
citrus and, on a minor scale, nickel.
   In a 1989 meeting at which I was present, the export
situation was revised (realistically), and Mr. Castro was
infuriated, blaming some ministers and top production
officials for the failure. He demanded unrealistic
achievements and set new, impossible goals. Such unrealistic
planning is an endless source of frustration for the Soviets.
   -- One area of Soviet support of Cuba likely to be
affected by current events in the Middle East is the
re-export concessions of crude oil and oil products. During
the past five or six years, Cuba re-exported substantial
quantities of Soviet oil through Soviet organizations, thus
obtaining additional "income" in hard currency. From 1985-88,
this channel represented one of the main sources of hard
currency -- in some years even more than the sugar crop. At
its peak, revenue from this channel amounted to $500 million
dollars. If the crisis in Iraq continues to lead to a
shortage of world crude oil, the Soviets are likely to cut
back substantially on Cuba's allotment.
   -- Another channel of Soviet aid to Cuba consists of the
supply of products previously bought by the Soviets for hard
currency abroad and later delivered to Cuba, payable in
rubles. For example, this applies to wheat flour regularly
purchased in Canada and directly sent to Cuba.
   -- Direct financial aid to Cuba covering the deficit of
the trade balance amounts to 2.5 billion rubles on a
five-year basis. In the 1985-90 period this sum was not
sufficient and Cuba asked for -- and received --
supplementary aid. The same amount has been allocated to
finance new projects and capital investments on a five-year
basis (in the past, such investments rarely proved
profitable).
   -- The concession of special or zero interest rates on
loans or credits granted to Cuba apply to what can be termed
short- and long-term support. Some weeks ago, for the first
time, the Soviet press released information of a well-kept
secret: the amount of the Cuban external debt. A Soviet
Finance Ministry release said that the Cuban debt was a
little more than 15.7 billion rubles. That leak was a bitter
surprise for the Cuban government, which refused to give this
information to the Paris Club when the discussions of the
Cuban external debt were carried out.
   In fact, in an internal discussion in May between Soviet
and Cuban officials at the commercial office of the Cuban
Embassy (at which I was also present), the debt was revealed
to be even higher -- about 17 billion rubles. The ability of
the Cuban government to pay or even begin paying installments
of this debt are remote, and the Soviet authorities are
perfectly aware of the real rating of this debt.
   Nevertheless, one of the points set by the Soviets before
a joint commision (established after the spring visit to Cuba
by the Soviet prime minister) was the conversion of the debt
to hard currency. Top Cuban officials reacted with alarm to
this proposal. But Nicoli Katushev, the main Soviet
negotiator, very firmly expressed that the matter will be on
the agenda when future agreements between the countries are
discussed.
   Top Soviet officials are fully aware that necessary cuts
in aid to Cuba will create hardships. That was one of the
main concerns of A. Abalkin, Soviet vice prime minister,
during his recent trip to Cuba. He said that the Soviets
would do their best to fulfill the trade and economic
agreements, but, "the Cubans have to re-adapt to the new
situation, find a new way of associating with Soviet
organizations and enterprises and overall begin to act in
accordance with economic market conditions."
   Until now, the Cuban position has not been flexible. In
fact, this week the regime reacted to further decreases in
Soviet aid not by opening the economy, but by imposing yet
more price controls, extending rationing of food, clothing
and household articles and restricting the sale of prized
electrical goods. An official statement published in the
Communist Party daily Granma outlined the new restrictions
and warned: "We repeat that we must be ready to face even
more difficult circumstances than the present ones." How many
more deprivations the Cuban people are willing to face is
uncertain.

   Canada Proposes
   Easing Ownership
   For Banks, Insurers

   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government proposed to allow
Canadian financial institutions greater scope for
diversification, raising the prospect of a new round of
acquisitions in the financial industry.
   At the same time, the government, mindful of the U.S.
savings and loan company failures, said it will tighten its
supervision of banks and other financial concerns.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government's plan would permit banks to own insurance
companies and trust companies, which are similar to U.S.
savings and loan companies. Trust companies and insurance
companies are to be allowed to own each other.
   Trust companies also are to be given full powers to lend
to business and consumers, allowing them to compete more
aggressively with banks. John Evans, president of the Trust
Companies Association, said the trust industry was "very
pleased" with the government plan.
   He said the tighter supervisory powers would guard against
any further failures of financial institutions, such as
occurred in the early 1980s when several small trust
companies collapsed. The new rules impose further
requirements on financial institutions to furnish federal
regulators with information on their financial health.
   The government's proposals require parliamentary approval.
Legislation to implement the proposed trust company changes
was introduced yesterday and legislation on banks and
insurance companies will be introduced later. All the new
laws are to take effect on the same date.
   The government proposed that at least 35% of the shares of
a large trust or insurance company be widely held within five
years. This requirement would apply to companies with at
least 750 million Canadian dollars (US$650 million) of
capital. The only trust company believed to be immediately
affected by the decision is Canada Trust, 98% owned by Imasco
Ltd., a Montreal-based holding company.
   An Imasco spokesman said the company was prepared to
comply with a 65% ownership ceiling in Canada Trust, provided
that the new legislation strengthens, as it appears to do,
the trust company's competitive position in the lending
business.
   Canada's major banks had urged the government to limit to
10% the trust company shareholding of any group or
individual. This would be the same rigorous ownership rule
that applies to banks. But the government decided that
federal trust and insurance companies could retain the right
to be closely held.
   Helen Sinclair, president of the Canadian Bankers'
Association, said she hoped the differences on the trust
company ownership issue "will receive full and thoughtful
scrutiny during the upcoming public debate" on the
government's plan.
   The government's proposals would allow the completion of
some proposed transactions, including Royal Bank of Canada's
planned purchase of International Trust Co. of Toronto. The
transaction was conditional on a lifting of the prohibition
of bank ownership of trust companies.
   Canadian banks are expected to move quickly to take
advantange of the new investment opportunities once the new
legislation is passed by Parliament. Five of Canada's six
major banks purchased securities companies after restrictions
on the ownership of securities firms were lifted in 1987.
   The government said restrictions on foreign ownership of
Canadian banks will be relaxed to permit entry into Canadian
banking of such institutions as insurance companies and
securities dealers.

   All I can say is thank goodness Ken Bode (former NBC News
political correspondent) and Sam Donaldson (ABC News) were
nonexistent reporters during World War II or we'd still be
trying to figure out a way to "negotiate" with Nazi Germany.
   According to your Aug. 28 article "Test for TV: Dodging
Gulf Propaganda," Mr. Bode says that "television isn't
exhibiting the kind of skepticism it should." And Sam
Donaldson doesn't think "the media has been as skeptical as
it could be."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since when was "skepticism" the major purpose of
journalism? I thought the journalist's job was to report the
news, get the facts straight and let the chips fall where
they may. If that were still today's definition of journalism
(which, for a change, most network reporters are adhering to)
the TV networks would not feel it necessary to present every
evening's newscast as though it were a point-counterpoint
production featuring Messrs. Bush and Hussein with equal-time
allotments.
   How skeptical does one have to be in the face of Iraqi
tanks and troops blitzkrieging their way into Kuwait,
followed by Saddam Hussein's massive roundup of the entire
international community -- men, women and children.
   I suppose it has become automatic for so-called reporters
such as Messrs. Donaldson and Bode to try to undercut
American confidence in any actions taken by their government,
even when taken in response to the barbaric events of the
past months.
   As a youngster I listened every day to truly great
reporting during World War II by men such as Edward R.
Murrow, Elmer Davis and William Shirer, none of whom tried to
plant seeds of doubt as to the motives of those who led our
country against the Axis powers. It was their reporting that
motivated me to go into journalism.
   All that Messrs. Donaldson and Bode (and a few others, to
be sure) motivate me to do is to flip to another channel.

   I've become more concerned over the media's perception of
responsible broadcasting. In your article, Mr. Donaldson's
statement that "playing devil's advocate is the press's
proper role" disturbs me. Where did he ever get the idea that
the public is interested in his or his network's opinion
during a news broadcast? His job is to report the facts and
let the public draw its own conclusions.
   In their zeal to beat each other in the ratings war, the
networks have lost some of their objectiveness and
impartiality. I have boycotted all news broadcasting of those
networks and exclusively rely on CNN and C-SPAN's objective
reporting.

   Kaifu Will Try to Assuage
   Public Opinion on U.S. Trip

   TOKYO -- "America-handling" has been Toshiki Kaifu's
strong point during his 13 months as prime minister. But
today he arrives in New York for a four-day visit that will
test that ability. It could make his subsequent six-day trip
to the tense Middle East seem like rest and relaxation.
   The irritants to U.S.-Japan relations that Mr. Kaifu faces
go beyond the usual trade squabbles. While Mr. Kaifu has
developed a strong relationship with President Bush, with
whom he will meet tomorrow, the real challenge for him will
be to use speech, news conference and interview opportunities
to assuage U.S. public opinion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Japan's delay in contributing to the Gulf crisis still
upsets some Americans, even though Japan has agreed to give
$4 billion. Talk of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. taking
over entertainment conglomerate MCA Inc. is exacerbating
fears by some that Japan is buying up the U.S.
   Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama's slur against U.S.
blacks, the latest by Japanese politicians in recent years,
raises anew the issues of Japan's alleged racism and
arrogance. And if all that weren't enough, another trade
squabble -- this one over Japan's ban on imported rice -- is
building.
   Mr. Kaifu will bring with him a new proposal on
agricultural trade. But analysts say it will be minimal and
isn't likely to satisfy U.S. demands.
   He also will lay out for U.S. officials the outlines of
legislation that would allow Japan to dispatch personnel for
strictly non-military duties in such emergencies as the Gulf
crisis, within the framework of United Nations peacekeeping
resolutions. But the "general view" is that "it will be a
matter of months" before the outlined legislation is
implemented, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo
Watanabe.
   Under the proposed legislation, members of Japan's Self
Defense Forces who are sent overseas would be under civilian
control, would serve only in non-combat roles such as
communications, transportation and medical support, and would
have to adhere to Japan's war-renouncing Constitution.
   Mr. Kaifu needs a diplomatic triumph. He gets high ratings
from the Japanese public, but his many enemies among fellow
Liberal Democratic Party politicians have picked up their
sniping, especially at his seemingly passive management of
Japan's response to the Gulf crisis.
   Mr. Kaifu's close ties with Mr. Bush, one of the sources
of his popularity, have to some extent turned into a
liability. There are titillating references in popular
magazines to Mr. Kaifu's "Bush phone," a play on the Japanese
word for a push-button phone that implies he makes no move
without consulting the president.
   "He's probably saying, `Yes sir, yes sir, yes George,' "
speculates one bureaucrat. "This is a leader-less country,
but now it looks especially leader-less."
   Foreign Ministry officials accompanying Mr. Kaifu to the
U.S. are sensitive to these charges and worry that Americans
may be getting the impression that Japan only acts under
pressure. This impression may have been fed, they fear, when
a $3 billion addition to Japan's initial contribution to the
Gulf was announced the day after the U.S. House of
Representatives demanded Japanese action.
   "The prime minister has the important task to make the
American people understand that this is really Japan's own
decision, that Japan is doing it for herself," a Foreign
Ministry official says. He argues that Japan can act without
U.S. pressure, but has so little experience responding to
security problems that it took time to debate questions
arising from Japan's Constitution, which renounces the use of
force in international relations, except for Self-defense.
   "We responded to the crisis with unusually fast speed {for
Japan}, but the level of expectation of the international
community for Japan with its size was way beyond our actual
capability, so frustration began to stir up {overseas}," the
official says.
   The U.S. has been hoping that Japan would help lead this
year's round of multilateral trade talks to a successful
conclusion by agreeing to ease its ban on rice imports.
Agricultural issues are a key element in the negotiations,
which enter their final stage next month. And a Japanese
concession on the politically sensitive rice issue would
increase pressure on the European Community to lower its
controversial farm subsidies.
   But it doesn't look like Mr. Kaifu will be able to please
Mr. Bush on this score. While some prominent Japanese
bureaucrats and politicians have recently argued for
liberalizing the rice market, government officials outlined a
proposal that calls for only a 30% decrease, over 10 years,
in overall agricultural subsidies from their high 1986
levels. The proposal, which is much closer to the EC position
than that of U.S., doesn't address the ban on rice imports.
   Mr. Kaifu leaves New York Monday evening for six days in
Cairo, Amman, Ankara, Jidda and Muscat. The goodwill trip,
scheduled before Iraq's attack on Kuwait, had been planned
for late August, but was postponed because Japan hadn't come
up with its Gulf contribution. Mr. Kaifu is expected to
emphasize Japan's solidarity with the anti-Iraq forces and to
explain the nature of Japan's contributions to the area.

   CML Group to Take
   A Charge, Post Losses
   For Quarter and Year

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
SPECIALTY RETAILERS (OTS)
</IN>
<LP>
   ACTON, Mass. -- CML Group Inc. said it expects to take a
pretax charge of $24 million to $25 million in the fourth
quarter, resulting in losses for the quarter and fiscal 1990.
   The charge stems from write-downs of the Carroll Reed
division, which was sold to a Hong Kong concern last month.
As a result, the company expects to report a net loss of $13
million to $14 million for the fourth quarter ended July 31,
Charles M. Leighton, chairman and chief executive officer
said. A year earlier, CML posted a loss of $43 million, or
$6.70 a share, after write-down charges.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It is also anticipated that the direct marketer of
consumer goods will report sales of about $61 million, up 30%
from $46.8 million.
   For the full year, CML said its net loss narrowed to $12.9
million from $31.9 million, or $4.92 a share, which includes
a loss of $26.3 million, or $4.07 a share, from discontinued
businesses. The company said it will report financial results
Monday.
   Excluding the Carroll Reed write-down, the company expects
to post a profit from continuing operations for the year of
about $13 million, or $1.95 a share, compared with a $5.5
million, or 85 cents a share, loss from continuing operations
in fiscal 1989.
   The company also expects to report that full-year sales
increased 19% to $278.8 million from $234.6 million.
   Leighton attributed CML's sales growth to brisk business
at its Nature Co. and NordicTrack divisions. Fiscal 1990
sales at Nature Co., a retailer that sells telescopes, maps
and outdoor instruments, increased 39% to more than $70
million; sales at NordickTrack, a maker of home exercise
equipment, rose 16% to about $85 million.
   Gains at Britches, the company's clothing retail-chain
division, were more modest. Hampered by a soft apparel
market, sales at its Britches stores division grew 11% to
$117 million from $105.7 million.
   Leighton said the company whittled its long-term bank debt
$17 million in fiscal 1990 to $68 million. Part of the money
came from proceeds from the sale of its Syber Vision and
Gokeys units, the rest from company cash. In fiscal 1991, CML
plans to further reduce that debt $20 million, using money it
received from the sale of Carroll Reed, Leighton said.
   The Carroll Reed sale was the last of CML's efforts to rid
itself of four businesses over the past fiscal year. "We've
sold off everything we want to sell, and from now on we think
our growth potential is outstanding," Leighton said.
   Its streamlined operations, reduced inventories and debt
will help the company gear up for a lackluster economy
expected in fiscal 1991, Leighton noted.

   NEW YORK -- Program trading rose to 10.1% of New York
Stock Exchange volume, or 12.5 million shares a day, for the
week ended Sept. 14.
   In the previous week, program trading amounted to 9.8% of
daily volume, the Big Board said in its regular report on the
computer-aided trading strategies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bear Stearns Cos. was the most active program-trading firm
for the latest week, trading 14.6 million shares in program
strategies; it also did more than one-third of all
stock-index arbitrage volume, mostly for its own account.
   Index arbitrage -- in which baskets of stocks are bought
and sold with offsetting trades in futures and options --
accounted for an unusually high 64.7% of program trading
volume. Arbitrage generally accounts for only about half of
overall program volume.
   Next to Bear Stearns, the next most-active firms were
Morgan Stanley Group Inc. (11.5 million shares), General
Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. unit (10.4 million),
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. (5.4 million) and PaineWebber Group Inc.
(5 million).
   "Buy" programs accounted for an average 2.6 million shares
daily and "sell" programs for 9.9 million, during a week in
which the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 55.44 points, or
2.1%.
   Program trading is the purchase or sale of a basket of at
least 15, and often hundreds of stocks worth at least $1
million.

   The Spy Who Came in From Canada

<LP>
   Victor Ostrovsky is an intelligence agency's worst
nightmare: a former agent with a book contract.
   By now, the most sensational revelations contained in his
chronicle of greed, lust and ambition at the Israeli
intelligence service, the Mossad, have been well publicized.
Among the charges: that a top-secret arm of the Mossad with
24 to 27 veteran officers is spying in the U.S. and that the
Mossad failed to give the U.S. a detailed warning about an
impending truck-bomb attack that killed 241 Marines in Beirut
in 1983.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And yet, even if Mr. Ostrovsky's charges prove true, they
are hardly surprising. After all, it's not unusual even for
friendly nations to spy on one another and refuse to share
information. (In the case of the Marines, the Israelis did
apparently pass on a tip, without many specifics so as not to
endanger their sources.) Instead, Mr. Ostrovsky's burst of
celebrity has largely come as the result of a heavy-handed
attempt by the Israeli government to ban the publication of
his book, "By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a
Mossad Officer" (St. Martin's Press, 336 pages, $22.95).
   According to Mr. Ostrovsky, two Mossad agents visited him
at his home in Ottawa in the hopes of persuading him not to
publish. First they appealed to his patriotism; then they
offered to bribe him. Finally, he says, they threatened to
kill him.
   As a last resort, the Mossad headed for courtrooms in
Canada and the U.S., winning a temporary order barring St.
Martin's from selling the book. It was a publicist's dream.
The first printing of 50,000 copies sold like Le Carre, after
an appeals court overturned the order. All this seems to be
propelling what is essentially a clumsily written tale,
co-authored by Canadian journalist Claire Hoy, to the
best-seller lists.
   It is not that the Mossad didn't have some reason for
concern. Mr. Ostrovsky liberally names Israeli agents and
reveals details about the Mossad's communication codes. But
some of the fuss is probably distress at Mr. Ostrovsky's
timing. Created in the wake of Israel's 1948 War of
Independence, the Mossad was seen as ruthlessly devoted to
the survival of a country surrounded by hostile neighbors. In
recent years that reputation has been tarnished by political
scandal and the spectacle of former Israeli operatives
selling their services to the highest foreign bidder,
including Colombia's Medellin drug cartel and Panama's Manuel
Noriega.
   Mr. Ostrovsky's is not an isolated voice in the call for
greater public accountability and openness by the Mossad. But
as a raconteur of the agency's misdeeds his credibility is
open to question. The first scene, in which the Mossad plies
an Iraqi scientist with money and prostitutes in an attempt
to get information about Iraq's nuclear complex, takes place
eight months before the Mossad even attempts to recruit Mr.
Ostrovsky.
   It is never satisfactorily explained how Mr. Ostrovsky
came by his intimate knowledge of events with which he had no
direct contact. Apparently, he had access to classified
Mossad computer files. But that doesn't explain how Mr.
Ostrovsky reconstructed entire conversations and the
innermost thoughts of agents luring targets into their traps.
   Mr. Ostrovsky inspires more confidence with his fact-heavy
front-line view of agent training. The story lumbers, but you
believe it when he describes how aspiring spies learn
discipline from beatings and other forms of humiliation.
There is practical training, too; the cadets learn how to
write secret messages, develop covers and follow people. They
spend their evenings scattered in apartments around Tel Aviv,
building secret cubbies for their documents and practicing
cover stories.
   These earnest Mossad agents are no James Bonds, although
some of their sexual exploits as recounted by Mr. Ostrovsky
suggest a high degree of physical fitness. They don't even
get to play with high-tech gadgets, but are taught how to
exploit human weaknesses, using money, sex or pressure to get
what they want.
   What's missing from the account is any sense of how Mr.
Ostrovsky feels as he slowly becomes, in his words, a con
artist for his country. Perhaps spies not inhabiting a Le
Carre novel are not introspective by nature, but Mr.
Ostrovsky claims to have kept a daily journal of his
experiences. Instead, he offers what read like transcripts of
every lecture he heard during the lengthy training.
   Mr. Ostrovsky is equally cursory when describing his
ouster from the Mossad. The "unmaking" of Mr. Ostrovsky takes
only a few pages as he describes how he was made a scapegoat
for a failed 1986 attempt by Israel to capture PLO leaders by
forcing down a private jet flying to Libya. That's
unfortunate because Mr. Ostrovsky manages to sidestep the
larger issue of whether he, or any spy, can ever be truly
"unmade." He merely offers a sly admonishment near the end of
the tale: "You can't always take a spy at his word."

   PARIS -- The Gulf crisis has knocked Euro-optimism for a
loop, and the staggering may continue for some time.
   The jump in oil prices, a looming U.S. recession, and
continuing worry about the costs and effects of German
unification all mean that Europe, especially Eastern Europe,
"is passing through the tunnel at the end of the light," says
Lawrence Freedman, professor of war studies at King's College
in London. He warns that a deep global recession could derail
East European and Soviet reforms, perhaps "leading to chaos,
social explosions and large migrations of people."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The immediate economic consequences of higher oil prices
are much greater in the East than in the West. Most East
European countries already face a major problem, knowing they
would have to start paying the world price, in dollars, for
Soviet oil by the end of the year. The doubling of world oil
prices only worsens their plight. "We don't see prosperity
anywhere on the horizon," says Bronislaw Geremek, a leader of
the Polish parliament. For Western Europe, economists have
trimmed as much as one percentage point off growth
expectations, but that still leaves West Europe growing by 2%
or more next year. Only in Britain, struggling with 10%
inflation, is a recession likely.
   More worrying, uncertainties over the Gulf crisis and its
long-term effects on the world economy have widened cracks in
European Community unity that had seemed to be narrowing.
Several EC countries are now expressing reservations about
the details and timing of establishing a single European
currency managed by a Europewide system of central banks,
although only Britain remains opposed to the end goals.
Doubts on the currency union expressed by Bundesbank
President KarlOtto Poehl and German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel have particularly irritated the French and the
Brussels EC bureaucracy. EC Commission President Jacques
Delors this week chided the Germans, asking "What do the
Germans want? Frankly, I often ask myself." Mr. Delors is
also miffed at the Spanish, who until recently have been big
EC unity backers.
   Meanwhile, the tardy, timid and fractured response of EC
countries to U.S. calls for money and men to aid the
anti-Iraq military buildup has demonstrated, to the
embarrassment of many here, that political unity is a long
way off. Most decisions about the Gulf continue to come from
national capitals, not Brussels. The French dispatched
thousands of soldiers to Saudi Arabia only after Iraqi
soldiers raided their embassy in Kuwait.
   "The Gulf shows us clearly that Eurocentrism is very
fragile," says Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French
Institute for International Relations. "The reality is that
the world remains dominated by military power," not economic
cohesion.
   But dogged optimists say the Gulf crisis illustrates the
urgency of greater, not less, European unity. "Only a sense
of cohesion and solidarity can protect Europeans from
large-scale external shocks," says Catherine Lalumiere,
secretary-general of the 23-nation Council of Europe. Europe
"has been drawn along by the U.S. in the Gulf crisis," says
Roger Fauroux, the French minister of industry. "If we want
to exist in future conflicts, and not have the Americans run
our affairs, we need rapid economic and monetary union, and
then political union."
   Indeed, with a summit meeting of the 35-nation Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe (also known as the
Helsinki process) scheduled for November, and two EC
treaty-writing conferences on economic and political unity
slated for December, momentum toward a more-united Europe
should be rekindled. "The machinery is there to give the
process its final push," says Gianni de Michelis, Italy's
foreign minister. "We're all going to need to make the tough
decisions on unity next year, because of the deadlines set by
these conferences," adds Elisabeth Guigou, who handles
European cooperation matters for French President Francois
Mitterrand.
   But the Gulf hangover persists. "It would be a tragedy if
the dramatic events in the Gulf obscured or halted the
incredible events that are leading to a united Europe," says
Robert Badinter, president of the French equivalent of the
U.S. Supreme Court. "And it would be criminal for the EC to
miss the chance to help Eastern Europe, for example, just
because of financial reasons. The end result would be worse
for everybody than before the Berlin Wall came down."

   Carnival Cruise Lines
   Expects Rise in Profit
   For Third Quarter

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
RECREATION, ENTERTAINMENT, TOYS, MOVIES, PHOTOGRAPHY, SPORTS (REC)
</IN>
<LP>
   MIAMI -- Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. said it expects to
report fiscal third-quarter per-share earnings in line with
analysts' estimates of 79 cents to 81 cents, up from the
year-earlier 63 cents, said Micky Arison, president and chief
executive officer.
   Net income will be between $105 million and $110 million,
Mr. Arison estimated, compared with the year-earlier
quarter's $84.4 million. Revenue for the quarter, ended Aug.
31, will approximate $500 million compared with $405.2
million a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Arison attributed the improved results to new business
generated from the Fantasy cruise ship, added to the fleet in
March. Extra capacity also came from the addition of 490
berths to the Westerdam this year. Carnival is the world's
largest cruise line based on passengers carried.
   In recent weeks, amid investor concerns about a recession
and rising fuel prices, Carnival's stock has had the wind
blown out of its sails. Recent analyst reports have reflected
some of the caution. Since early August, Carnival's stock
price has fallen about 34%. "Our stock has taken a pretty
good hammering," said Mr. Arinson.
   But the president said the concerns are overblown. On
fuel, he said, there was "very little impact" on
third-quarter earnings. And fuel costs are proportionally
much lower for the cruise industry, he said, than for others
in the travel business, such as airlines. When Iraq invaded
Kuwait, said Mr. Arison, fuel represented less than 3% of
Carnival's cost of sales -- a figure that has now only
climbed to about 4%. While conceding some small negative
impact on earnings in the future, he said, "We don't believe
that these fuel rates are sustainable." He added that "some
percentage of our going-forward fuel needs have been hedged."
   As to the possibility of a recession, Mr. Arison says
investors need only look at history. In the 1982 recession,
he said, Carnival's bookings didn't decline. "We offer a good
value, all-inclusive vacation," that people who already plan
to go on vacation flock to in penny-pinching times, he said.
   In the third quarter, occupancy levels were slightly
higher than the year-earlier quarter's 112.2%. (In the cruise
business, two passengers in a room count as 100% occupancy;
if kids or others stay, too, it rises above 100%.)
   For the nine months, net will approximate $184 million to
$189 million, or $1.38 to $1.40 a share, compared with the
year-earlier period's $172.3 million, or $1.28 a share.
Revenue will be about $1 billion, up from the $921.6 million
in the year-earlier period.

   Critic Says Japan
   Is Too Subservient
   To U.S. in Gulf

   TOKYO -- If Shintaro Ishihara, Japan's best known
nationalist, were prime minister Japan's Persian Gulf policy
would be very different indeed.
   Mr. Ishihara dismisses Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu as "an
innocent boy" and calls Japan's management of the current
crisis "childish." He favors a posture that's both more
reliant on the United Nations, on the one hand, but
potentially more willing to commit Japanese military force to
the region, on the other. While completely unsympathetic with
Saddam Hussein and his aggression on Kuwait, Mr. Ishihara is
very sympathetic with Arab nationalism.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They {the Arabs} still have a sense of colonial
domination by white people," Mr. Ishihara said in an
interview. "Japan can sympathize with them. We too are
colored in a way. Japanese have a different mentality from
white people."
   Mr. Ishihara, a Liberal Democratic Party member of
parliament and co-author of the controversial book "The Japan
That Can Say No," doesn't necessarily speak for anyone but
himself.
   But he is one of Japan's most popular politicians. Many
Japanese admire his outspoken views, even though they
wouldn't dare say such radical things themselves. In
particular, many Japanese agree with Mr. Ishihara that Japan
is too subservient to the U.S.
   "I'm not saying Japan should say `no' to the U.S. 100%" in
the Gulf situation, he says. But he would like Japan's Gulf
policy to be "a bit aloof" from the U.S.'s. The countries
whose stances he most admires include the Soviet Union, which
is broadly supportive of the multinational forces in the Gulf
but wants a stronger role for the United Nations.
   Mr. Ishihara believes the U.S. was too hasty in
dispatching forces to the Gulf. He would have advised making
more use of the United Nations first. Now that U.S. forces
are present, he says, the U.S. runs enormous risks. If Saddam
Hussein emerges from the situation with any part of his
initial aims achieved, the most radical elements in the
region will be inspired to try to topple all moderate Arab
regimes friendly to Washington. So if war ensues, Mr.
Ishihara muses, the U.S. had better not stop at recovering
Kuwait; it had better "go all the way to Baghdad."
   By totally subscribing to the U.S. line, Mr. Ishihara
believes, Japan gives away one of its most important "cards,"
the chance to play a mediating role in the crisis. He says
73% of Iraq's foreign aid -- but none of its armaments --
came from Japan, which could have given Japan both leverage
and a strong moral platform for playing a mediating role.

   Destroying the Banks to Save Them

   There's a simple way to describe Washington's current
response to financial weakness in the banking industry:
panic. Fearful that banks may be going the way of the S&amp;Ls,
policymakers are uncritically advancing solutions that will
bring about the result they are hoping to avert.
   In July, several officials called for higher capital
requirements for banks -- a goal that was widely endorsed in
Congress and the press. In August, the FDIC proposed raising
deposit insurance premiums for banks by the maximum allowable
amount -- to almost 20 cents on every $100 of deposits --
again to resounding applause. In September, the Comptroller
General of the United States, in testimony before the Senate
Banking committee, reported that the FDIC's bank insurance
fund was near depletion and recommended that the FDIC be
permitted to raise deposit insurance rates without limit in
order to restore the integrity of the fund. This idea was
endorsed even by the Treasury Department and legislation to
bring it about was passed by the House and introduced in the
Senate by Donald Riegle, the Chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   How would banks that are required to raise their capital
be expected to do so? There are basically three ways: sell
shares, retain earnings or sell off assets (and shed
corresponding liabilities). The success of the first two
obviously depends on the ability of management to earn
profits. The sale of shares is heavily disfavored because it
dilutes the ownership of current shareholders -- but it is
unlikely to be a viable option in any case because (as the
S&amp;Ls have discovered) there is no market for the shares of a
depository institution that is only marginally profitable.
   Increasing profitability, on the other hand, means
increasing risk, since the more profitable loans and
investments are those that have the greatest inherent risk.
Selling assets and shedding liabilities is a viable course,
but in practical terms it also means increasing risk because
the market is interested only in buying the banks' least
risky assets. Thus, it is not necessarily true that raising
capital standards for banks will leave them stronger; in
fact, if banks must strive to meet higher capital
requirements they may weaken themselves by increasing the
relative riskiness of their portfolios.
   Then there is the issue of deposit insurance premiums.
Obviously, an increase in these premiums will reduce the
profitability of banks, making it harder for them to increase
capital or to maintain the capital levels they already have.
And although a deposit insurance premium of almost 20 cents
on every $100 of deposits does not sound very large, it is
important to remember that a reasonably well-managed U.S.
bank earns about $1 on every $100 of assets, with money
center banks generally below this level. Since banks fund
about 75% of their assets with deposits, a deposit insurance
premium even at the current level represents about 15% of
pretax earnings and is thus a significant amount. An increase
in this obligation will obviously further reduce the earnings
of banks and cause them -- if they are to remain profitable
-- to take on greater risk even if they don't have to
increase their capital.
   Thus, not only is there a contradiction between higher
deposit insurance premiums and requiring banks to increase
their capital, but both steps -- together and separately --
will weaken the financial condition of banks by causing them
to take on more portfolio risk. Why, then, have both ideas --
together and separately -- been so widely applauded in
Washington?
   The reason seems to be that Washington policymakers have
mistakenly assumed that the best protection for the taxpayers
is the health of the deposit insurance funds. This is
completely wrong. As clearly shown by the S&amp;L debacle, the
best protection for the taxpayers is not the size of the
deposit insurance funds; it is the health of the institutions
these funds insure.
   Once a substantial portion of a whole industry begins to
slip toward insolvency, the deposit insurance funds have no
meaning. The liability of the taxpayers for the S&amp;L
industry's massive losses goes far beyond the size of the
insurance fund that once guaranteed the deposits in S&amp;Ls,
even when the insurance fund was at its healthiest. For this
reason, the current debate about the optimum size of the bank
insurance fund is a sideshow -- except to the extent that the
policies chosen to rescue the fund contribute further to the
weakness of the industry the fund insures.
   To some extent, Washington is confused by its own
rhetoric. Deposit insurance was presented as insurance, in
much the same way and for much the same reason that Social
Security was. But deposit insurance is insurance in name
only. The size of the deposit insurance fund bears no
relationship to the risks it is intended to cover. The
premiums paid by insureds bear no relationship to the risks
they impose on the fund, and are not intended to -- and do
not -- affect the riskiness of their behavior.
   It is important to make this distinction, because if
deposit insurance were in fact insurance then the proper
response to a decline in the size of the deposit insurance
fund would be higher premiums on banks -- since higher
premiums in a true insurance scheme would discourage the
behavior insured against. But deposit insurance premiums are
not insurance premiums; they are a tax on the banking
industry, levied for the privilege of receiving federal
government and ultimately taxpayer backing for certain
liabilities. If there were ever any doubt about this
proposition, it was removed by the S&amp;L bailout, in which the
presence or absence of an insurance fund was largely
irrelevant. Depositors were bailed out by the taxpayers; the
FSLIC fund served at most as a small deduction from the
taxpayers' total bill.
   Looked at in this way, it becomes far less clear that an
increase in deposit insurance premiums is the appropriate
response to a decline in the size of the deposit insurance
fund. Clearly, there is growing financial weakness in the
banking industry. This weakness has already caused a
substantial decline in the size of the deposit insurance fund
administered by the FDIC. The relevant question, however, is
not how to shore up the fund but how to address the banking
industry's weakness. It cannot seriously be contended that
banking or any other industry will be strengthened when
higher taxes are levied on it.
   When Congress was considering the S&amp;L bailout legislation
last year, it was warned that the S&amp;L industry could not
survive increased capital requirements, increased deposit
insurance premiums, reduced investment opportunities and
lower earnings from its investment in the Home Loan Bank
System. Although this would seem fairly obvious to most
people, the purpose of the legislation was not the survival
of the industry but the survival of the legislators. A year
later, we can only hope that policymakers will take a longer
term view.

   Unlisted Shares Continue Slide on Oil;

   NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks slipped on oil again
yesterday.
   Crude oil prices increased nearly 90 cents a barrel,
sending stock prices lower again as investors continued to
grapple with the inflationary impact of higher oil prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The losses left the Nasdaq Composite Index at its lowest
level since January 1988. The index closed at 341.19, down
8.84 or 2.5%.
   New York Stock Exchange issues faired somewhat better; the
Big Board composite index lost 2.16, or 1.3%, and the Dow
Jones Industrial Average shed 32.17, or 1.3%.
   While oil price movements largely dictated the stock
markets' direction, traders say other issues also continue to
influence the market. Rumors about the military standoff in
the Persian Gulf and the ongoing federal budget talks in
Washington also affected stocks, traders say.
   "The tone of the market is definitely bearish right now
and there's really nothing that's going to turn that around,"
says Len Hefter, managing director of Jefferies &amp; Co.'s OTC
desk in Dallas.
   "Until something definitive starts to happen in the Middle
East, it's going to be the same thing -- a lot of
nervousness," Mr. Hefter says.
   Nasdaq decliners overwhelmed advancers, 1,486 to 561.
Volume climbed to 153.3 million shares, up sharply from
Wednesday's 118.7 million shares.
   Traders agree that even if a budget accord is reached, it
will be only a short-term positive for stocks with the Middle
East crisis continuing to loom.
   "There are just too many negatives, too many rumors and
stories. You just can't operate intelligently in a market
when that's going on," says Robert Antolini, head of OTC
trading at Donaldson Lukfin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   Oracle fell 5/8 to 5 5/8 in heavy trading yesterday after
gyrating wildly on two apparently fabricated documents
alleging Oracle is the target of a takeover bid. Oracle, a
highflying supplier of database software that has fallen on
hard times, declined to comment on the documents.
   One of the documents, which appeared to be an internal
memo from Prudential-Bache Securities, declared that "an
offshore concern is about to file its intention to acquire
Oracle as early as next week." But an official at
Prudential-Bache insisted the document was fraudulent.
   The other document, purporting to be a press release from
Hitachi Ltd., stated it was Hitachi's intention to acquire
five million of Oracle's shares. But the document contained
numerous errors and misstated Hitachi's formal name.
   On Tuesday, Oracle announced a quarterly loss that was
one-third larger than the company predicted three weeks ago.
The loss, the company's first ever, comes on the heels of
disclosures of accounting "glitches" and financial
restatements at the company. The string of disclosures has
torpedoed the company's stock, which peaked late last year at
more than $28. Oracle was the day's most active issue, as
4.77 million shares were traded.
   Other active stocks included Intel, down 3/4 to 32 on 4.2
million shares; Conner Peripherals, down 1 3/8 to 16 1/8 on
2.7 million-shares; and Sun Microsystems, down 2 to 25 3/4 on
1.6 million shares.
   NovaCare Inc. lost 1/2 to 14 5/8 as 3.2 million of its
common shares came to market at $15 each. A total of 2.2
million NovaCare shares changed hands on the day.
   Dain Bosworth equity trader Dennis Murray says that some
of the few sectors of the market that have maintained their
favored status are finally falling out of grace. "We are
seeing more and more darling stocks being taken out and
getting shot," he says.
   Among these fallen angels are health care and
biotechnology stocks, he says. In those areas yesterday,
Amgen lost 2 3/8 to 46 1/4, St. Jude Medical lost 3/4 to 26
3/4, U.S. HealthCare shed 1 3/4 to 17 7/8 and Biomet dropped
1/4 to 27 3/4.
   Pop Radio's shares lost more than a third of their value,
shedding 5 1/8 to 10 after Heritage Media suggested that the
firms' merger pact may be in jeopardy.
   Heritage Media, in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing, said it doesn't expect all conditions of the merger
to be satisified by an Oct. 31 deadline, at which time both
companies can back out of the transaction. Heritage said it
hasn't yet decided whether to proceed with the merger after
the deadline.
   Meanwhile, Nike shares fell 3 3/4 to 60 3/4. A Nike
spokesman said the firm doesn't have any news pending. He
indicated that Nike is "very comfortable" with analysts'
estimates in the range of $7.50 to $8.25 a share for the
fiscal year ending in May 1991. Nike earned $6.42 a share in
fiscal 1990.
   Action Auto Rental gained 3/4 to 2 5/8 after the company
announced plans to buy back up to three million shares.
   Software Toolworks fell 1 1/4 to 6 1/4 after Piper Jaffray
&amp; Hopwood analyst Bob Kleiber lowered his earnings estimates
for the company's 1991 and 1992 fiscal years.
   Mr. Kleiber cut his forecast for the fiscal year ending
March 31, 1991, to a range of between $1.20 and $1.40 a share
and lowered his fiscal 1992 estimate to between $1.85 to
$2.15.
   Network General shed 1 7/8 to 4 1/4 after disclosing that
it expects second quarter net income to be below its first
quarter level of 13 cents a share, as adjusted for a
two-for-one stock split. Additionally, the company said that
shipments of its "WatchMaster" product have been deferred.
   Network General's disclosures prompted Alex. Brown &amp; Sons
Inc. analyst, John Rohal, to downgrade his investment rating
on the stock to "hold" from "buy" and to trim his earnings
estimate for the firm.
   OTC financial stocks continued to founder, including
insurer Cincinnati Financial, which fell 1/4 to 73 after
trading as low as 66 3/4. While a company spokesman Wednesday
said the firm knew of no reason to account for the fall,
earlier this week analysts blamed the drop on short sellers.
The stock fell 4 7/8 Wednesday.
   Among other insurance firms, Ohio Casualty dropped 1 3/4
to 29 1/4, St. Paul Cos. lost 3 to 48, Safeco dropped 1 to 26
7/8 and Provident Life shed 3/4 to 16 3/4.
   The banking sector was hit with more negative news as New
York Stock Exchange-traded Bank of Boston joined the ranks of
institutions projecting losses and reducing their quarterly
dividend payouts.
   Midlantic lost 1/2 to 7 3/8, BayBanks dropped 1 1/4 to 12
1/4, Michigan National lost 3/4 to 22 and State Street Boston
fell 7/8 to 29 1/8.
   U.S. Trust Corp. fell 3/4 to 28 3/4 on top of its 3/8 loss
Wednesday. The company said Wednesday that $16.2 million in
special charges in the third quarter would result in a loss
of about $7 million, or 77 cents a share, for the period.
Last year, U.S. Trust earned $10.5 million, or $1.05, in the
third quarter.

   FDA Is Hindered
   By Funds Shortage,
   Task Force Asserts

   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration is "an
agency under stress" whose shortage of funds could cast doubt
on its "ability to perform its many tasks satisfactorily,"
according to an interim report by a blue-ribbon task force.
   The task force was appointed by Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan earlier this year in the wake of
much unfavorable publicity for the agency, including
disclosures of fraud in the generic-drug approval process.
Several FDA officials were convicted for accepting bribes
from drug companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The interim report didn't address the generic-drug scandal
itself, but it did refer to "weakened public confidence" in
the agency's ability to do its job.
   The panel is chaired by Charles C. Edwards, a former FDA
commissioner. Another panel member is David Kessler, who is
widely believed to be Dr. Sullivan's choice to head the FDA,
which has been leaderless since the departure of Frank Young
in November. No formal nomination has been made for the post,
which requires Senate confirmation.
   Because the task force isn't expected to finish its
inquiry until next year, the findings of this report are
tentative. Nevertheless, the report did note that the FDA is
"hampered in many areas by shaken morale," and is "short of
equipment, facilities, and basic infrastructure."
   The report also said the FDA's ability to rapidly develop
new regulations and propose new laws was hampered by
"multiple review procedures," an apparent reference to
current requirements that FDA actions be approved by
officials at HHS, of which the FDA is a division. Among the
solutions the panel pledged to consider is to allow the FDA
commissioner to issue regulations on his own, as was the case
before 1981.
   Although the FDA regulates 25% of the nation's gross
national product, its fiscal 1990 appropriation is a
comparatively small $601 million. During the past decade,
Congress substantially added to the FDA's responsibilities
over items ranging from artificial heart valves to eye
shadow, but the agency's budget didn't grow significantly
larger, after inflation, than it was in 1980.
   In a letter to Dr. Edwards, Dr. Sullivan wrote that he
supports "additional resources in selected areas for the FDA"
but noted "significant limitations we can expect on the
federal budget." He also urged the committee to look into the
areas of product review and regulatory enforcement.

   Experiments on Rats May Solve Problem
   Of Baldness Induced by Chemotherapy

   Scientists experimenting with rats may have stumbled on a
potential answer to the temporary baldness that plagues
cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
   Researchers at the University of Miami School of Medicine
in Florida said they came across two surprises in experiments
in which powerful anti-cancer drugs were administered to
week-old rats.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One surprise was that many of the rats went bald in the
few days after receiving the anti-cancer drugs. Heretofore,
this chemotherapy-induced baldness has been seen only in
humans.
   The second surprise was that some of the young rats
receiving a combination of two anti-cancer drugs didn't go
bald. These hirsute rodents were receiving a combination of
an older drug called ARA-C, which is known to induce
baldness, along with a new, still-experimental anti-cancer
drug called ImuVert.
   The researchers' conclusion, backed by subsequent
experiments, is that ImuVert somehow prevents the baldness
induced by older cancer drugs -- at least it does that in
young rats.
   "We don't know if it also works in humans and, even it
does, there might be better agents than ImuVert" that would
prevent baldness in patients, said Dr. Adel A. Yunis, the
oncologist and biochemist who heads the research team that
reported the discovery in this week's Science.
   Temporary baldness is such a severe psychological problem
for many patients, particularly women, undergoing
chemotherapy that some may even refuse treatment because of
it, Dr. Yunis and his colleagues said. Little or no progress
has been made in preventing, or treating, the baldness --
partly because there hasn't been an animal model for
experiments.
   The discovery in the rats "opens a whole, wide area of
research on this problem," Dr. Yunis said.
   The discovery "was a surprise to us," said William
Critchfield, chief financial officer of Cell Technology Inc.
in Boulder, Colo., a small research company founded in the
mid-1970s to develop ImuVert as a potential cancer treatment.
ImuVert is extracted from a common bacterium, called
"Serratia marcescens", and is considered a "biological
response modifier," a drug that enhances the immune reaction
to cancer. Human trials are under way to see if it is
effective in adult brain cancer, Mr. Critchfield said.
   The Miami researchers were testing the drug's effects,
alone and in combination with older drugs, against leukemia
cells transplanted in young rats. In these experiments, only
five of 20 who received ARA-C plus ImuVert had a mild hair
loss. In contrast, 16 of 23 rats receiving only ARA-C went
totally bald. ImuVert alone doesn't cause baldness in humans
or animals.
   The researchers saw the same baldness prevention when
ImuVert was used in rats treated with doxorubicin or
cyclophosphamide, two widely used anti-cancer drugs that also
induce baldness in patients.

   BLOOMFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich. -- Erhard Dahm's sparkling new
BMW dealership in this well-heeled Detroit suburb doesn't
sell lemons. But you can get egg rolls there.
   Under the same roof as Erhard BMW's stone-floored
showroom, and right behind its floor-to-ceiling smoked-glass
windows, sits the Golden Phoenix, a Chinese restaurant. In
the west wing of Erhard's Ushaped building you can buy a jet
black BMW 750 iL for $72,870. In the east wing you can buy
the Golden Phoenix's house favorite -- sweet and sour shrimp
-- for $9.75. Take out or eat in.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A charming juxtaposition, perhaps, even though it was
accidental. But it won't last much longer.
   "Having a Chinese restaurant in your building isn't part
of BMW's corporate standards," says Chris Consiglio, the
dealership's general manager.
   These strange bedfellows got together last year, when Mr.
Dahm bought the building that housed the Strike &amp; Spare
bowling alley along with the Golden Phoenix. Mr. Dahm then
began converting the 50,000 square-foot structure for his car
dealership. Shortly thereafter the owners of the Golden
Phoenix exercised an option to extend their lease, despite
the sale of the building. Erhard BMW has made it clear that,
come July, the Golden Phoenix will have to whip up its egg
foo yong somewhere else.
   But if the restaurant's patrons had their way, it would be
Erhard BMW that would have to hit the road. "I don't want
{the restaurant} to move," says James Howard of nearby
Bloomfield Hills, who owns a small steel company. "It's a
family, neighborhood restaurant." Other patrons are
considering a petition drive to keep the Golden Phoenix where
it has been since 1972.
   Erhard BMW, meanwhile, is trying to avoid looking like the
bad guy in all this. Dealership officials explain that they
moved to the upscale neighborhood "to be nearer our
clientele." And it's certainly not the food. "I eat there
once a week," Mr. Consiglio says.
   Yee Ting, manager of the Golden Phoenix, is discouraging a
petition drive. He thinks that could only lead to trouble.
Mr. Yee came to the U.S. from Hong Kong 15 years ago, and he
feels he has learned some of life's important lessons.
   "Who has more money, has the power," he says. "Money
talks."

   Herd on the Street: U.S. Plans
   To Produce Its Own Beef
   From the Storied Wagyu

   GEORGETOWN, Texas -- Sitting quietly in thin vials in Don
Lively's dusty barn here, guarded by two growling dogs, is
something you can't buy anywhere else in America. It is pure
Japanese bull semen.
   Mr. Lively's store of the stuff is worth $2 million. No
bull.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Semen is all that remains of four bulls spirited out of
Japan 14 years ago. Their names were Judo, Mazda, Fuji and
Ryusho, and they are believed to have been the only cattle of
the Wagyu breed ever to leave Japan.
   The bulls died natural deaths after 12 years in the U.S.,
but in the meantime they left behind enough semen for
thousands of progeny.
   American cattlemen used to consider the Wagyu breed puny
and pitifully ugly. Then, in 1988, Japan agreed to end quotas
by 1991 that have stifled imports of beef from America.
   Suddenly, Wagyus looked a lot prettier to U.S. ranchers,
who saw a way to horn in on a market.
   The Japanese have a special love for Wagyu meat, often
called Kobe Beef in the U.S. They say the way fat is marbled
into the meat produces a divine taste, buttery texture and
perfect appearance. They pay up to $180 a pound for it, and
the idea of capturing even a small slice of this has kindled
acute interest in American Wagyu.
   Mr. Lively's liquid assets have become immensely valuable.
Ranchers from Idaho to Australia looking for a stake in the
market have begun draining his semen stockpile, paying $250 a
vial -- enough to impregnate one cow. Even though that's
about 10 times the cost of normal high-grade semen, Mr.
Lively has sold $1 million worth already.
   Not only that, but some also pay up to $25,000 each for
Mr. Lively's nearly full-blooded Wagyu bulls, which he
created by inbreeding generations of cattle with Japanese
semen.
   Under normal circumstances, ranchers simply would import
Wagyus from Japan to populate their feed lots. But
circumstances aren't normal with Japan. While Japanese
farmers freely import cattle, they won't let Wagyus out.
   Japanese cattlemen say Wagyus and their seed are national
treasures. Exporting them, they say, would be like smuggling
out defense secrets. The informal export ban is enforced by
pressure from powerful farm cooperatives.
   Japanese cattlemen "think that if they export Wagyu semen
they may be immediately menaced by wide-scale reproduction in
the U.S.," says livestock professor Shozo Watanabe of
Kagoshima University.
   They may have a point. Today, the four exported bulls'
genetic pool -- semen and hundreds of mixed-blood Wagyu
cattle -- gives U.S. ranchers a rare opportunity to take a
lesson from Japan's industrial success: reverse engineering.
   U.S. breeders have raised cattle that are as much as
63/64ths Wagyu (more than the 15/16ths is considered
purebred). Because of a shortage of Wagyu cows, Texas A&amp;M
University is even cloning them, implanting identical embryos
in non-Wagyu cows.
   "We can reverse-engineer this and end up better than
them," says Robert Rebholtz, president of Agri Beef Co. of
Boise, Idaho, who is crossing Wagyus with black Angus cattle.
   Agri Beef, like most U.S. producers, plans to make the
beef both for export to Japan and for the U.S. Producers say
it not only tastes better, but is lower in the kind of fats
that raise cholesterol levels. (It will also be more
expensive. One reason: Wagyu beef are fed less each day for a
much longer period than U.S. cattle, which are fed huge
amounts quickly so they can be fattened up and processed in a
hurry.)
   The circumstances of the bulls' exodus from Japan are
still a dark mystery and discussion of their departure is
still like waving a red flag to the Japanese. The bulls
"shouldn't have been let out," says Umeo Oikawa, a Wagyu
raiser in northern Japan. "Those cattle weren't any one
person's property. They were raised through the efforts of
Japanese farmers over thousands of years."
   And indeed, for a long time the bulls seemed to carry a
Tut-like curse.
   In 1975, Texas cattleman Morris Whitney heard of Wagyu
meat from friends in the military and decided that Americans
were ready for Kobe Beef. He linked up with a mysterious
Japanese businessman who somehow got the bulls onto a plane
to New Jersey faster than the Japanese could say, "Where's
the beef?"
   Then partnerships collapsed, deals soured, the Japanese
businessman disappeared and Mr. Whitney ended up with four
bulls on his farm, some set loose among the cacti on the open
range.
   While his bulls dined on prickly pear, Mr. Whitney courted
stores such as Neiman Marcus, which he hoped would sell his
Wagyu beef in high-priced gift boxes much as Japanese stores
do.
   But there weren't any bites from stores or other ranchers,
who didn't care to raise the homely beast. A Wagyu is
everything an American rancher disdains, what with its dainty
bones, thin-skinned torso and narrow, pointed rump that makes
it look swaybacked.
   Ranchers, who are fond of macho cattle, complain that
Wagyus are nervous, hyperactive animals that irritatingly
walk with tiny little mincing steps.
   The bulls survived the open range, but for Mr. Whitney,
the years were lean. After sinking $300,000 into breeding the
cattle, he sold out to a partner for $6,500 and went into the
real estate business. "I was ahead of my time," he sighs.
   The buyer, a veterinarian named Dennis Wendt, apparently
had big dreams of becoming king of the Wagyu business.
Drawing in friends and relatives as investors with what could
be called a tender offer, he mimicked the legendary nurturing
of the Japanese, who have sometimes attributed their beef's
marbling to beer feedings and individual massage sessions,
although those methods are not actually practiced widely in
Japan.
   Mr. Wendt rubbed down his cattle and trucked in 6,000
cases of beer, popping open cans into troughs.
   The main effect? "Just what you'd expect," says Mr. Wendt,
"Drunk, lazy cattle."
   The bovine bacchanalia didn't create any better meat, and
the venture folded in bitterness in 1983. The assets were
carved up among partners. Some got cattle. Others got nearly
worthless semen.
   That any survived may be a minor miracle. Last year, Mr.
Lively says, a large-scale rancher visiting his LoDo Ranch
confessed that he unknowingly dumped out 6,000 units of Wagyu
semen, worth about $1.5 million at Mr. Lively's prices.
   Mr. Lively ended up with the four bulls on LoDo Ranch
after his partner sued Mr. Wendt's venture. For years, his
rancher friends ribbed him for raising his "uglies." Mr.
Lively, a 62-year-old retired stone carver, had little to do
but quietly breed his herd. "They all thought I was crazy,"
he says. "All I had was these stinking cows. And they weren't
even pretty."
   He is clearly getting the last laugh now because anyone
who wants the prime semen has no other choice. The stuff is
expensive, says Jerry Reeves, a Washington State University
professor who buys it for the Wagyu cattle the school breeds,
"but he's the only choice we've got."
   Moreover, Japanese companies are aggressively buying U.S.
ranches and are eager to stock them with Wagyus. Mr. Lively,
who keeps a Japanese flag on a crooked flagpole near his
barn, has sold animals to a U.S. unit of Japan's big Itoham
Foods Inc.
   Executives of Toyota's trading subsidiary visited LoDo
Ranch this year with a mind to buying most of the operation.
The deal collapsed after Toyota balked at the price -- which
Mr. Lively won't reveal -- but Mr. Lively says they'll be
back after they chew it over.
   Japan's ranchers contend that U.S. Wagyu meat isn't the
real thing, but the big test will come next January: That's
when Texas A&amp;M plans to ship beef from 10 of its Wagyus to
Japan for blind taste tests. A&amp;M officials aren't predicting
the outcome of the head-to-head competition, but they're sure
they won't be slaughtered.

   Property, Bank Stocks Weigh on Tokyo

   TOKYO -- The Japanese stock market seems to be signaling
the worst fears of people in pricey Osaka suburbs and
downtown Tokyo boardrooms: Japan's sky-high land prices are
poised for a plunge.
   At least, that's what some market analysts are concluding.
If they're right, big troubles lie ahead for banks and
securities companies with exposure to real estate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since Jan.1, property-related stocks listed on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange have lost 55% of their value, according to
Credit Lyonnais Securities (Japan) Ltd., compared with a
decline of 44% for the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues.
   Banks are down 49% and securities companies -- their
profits already crushed by the stock market's steep reversals
-- are off 59%.
   On Thursday, the Nikkei index closed at 21771.91, off
478.71.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei sagged another 548.77 points
to close the morning session at 21223.14.
   "From these numbers, one is tempted to think land prices
are likely to come down," says Credit Lyonnais's Benedicte
Ivey. Adds Stuart Matthews, a financial analyst in Tokyo for
Britain's Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd.: "These
(property and financial companies) are the guys who suffer
the pain earliest, and the market is reflecting their
prospects."
   Like the stock market when it closed 1989 at a record
high, Japan's property market has been bloated by years of
easy money -- big trade surpluses, low interest rates and a
high exchange rate. A shift in those fundamentals snapped the
stock market's rise earlier this year. Yet land prices in
Japan remain the highest in the world: The market value of
the land in metropolitan Tokyo already exceeds the value of
all the property in the continental U.S., and land prices in
Japan are still soaring.
   Just last week, the National Land Agency reported that
residential land prices rose 13.2% on average during the 12
months ended June 30, the fastest rate in two decades.
Commercial land prices were up 13.4%. The average price of a
square meter (1.2 square yards) in Tokyo was 858,600 yen
($6,237.48).
   The only indication in the survey that land prices might
be cooling was that property prices in Osaka and other cities
outside Tokyo had stopped rising. Some real estate firms in
Tokyo also have reported anecdotal evidence of declining
prices.
   While many observers, including some senior finance
officials, believe property prices will hold or at worst
decline slowly, some in the stock market now are latching
onto the recent reports as evidence that prices will head
south, and maybe in a hurry.
   "I definitely think there will be a fall in land prices,"
says Bernard Siman, a real estate analyst at Jardine Fleming
Securities Co. He predicts that the decline will occur mainly
outside of Tokyo, and will carry land prices nationwide down
about 20%. In the capital, where demand is still high, prices
may fall only around 7%, he adds.
   In part, he ascribes the containment of land prices to
moves by both the Bank of Japan and the Finance Ministry to
persuade banks, insurance companies and even some other
finance companies to cut their lending to the property
market.
   More significant, he says, is the drop in share prices.
"That hurts capital formation," Mr. Siman says. "It's hard to
raise money."
   Mr. Siman says the stock market's warnings of a crash in
property prices really might foreshadow a crisis in the
banking industry that could trigger a drop in property
prices. Japan's banks, anxious to meet international
capital-adequacy ratios coming into effect in March 1993,
recently have flooded the world's capital markets with about
$7 billion in subordinated loans and bonds. If the banks find
they can't raise enough capital, they could start pulling in
loans to the property market.
   The consequences for Japan's -- and the world's -- economy
could be devastating. Capital from Japan already is in short
supply; the country's investors pulled $8.9 billion out of
U.S. stocks and bonds in the first half of the year. A major
reason they did so was to cover losses from the stock-market
decline at home: So far this year, the drop in Tokyo share
prices has wiped out close to 300 trillion yen in stock
values, the biggest loss ever in a stock market decline.
   Some analysts say the ties between the stock and property
market suggest that property prices should decline now, too.
In the past, Japanese investors often borrowed against rising
property holdings to raise money they then invested in the
stock market. If they can't now repay the borrowings, their
recourse -- or the banks' -- may be to sell property.
   But so far foreclosures have been rare. Any indication
that a bank is trying to cash out of the property market
could trigger a collapse in land prices.
   Nobuyuki Ueda, an economist for LongTerm Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd., compares the banks' position to the developing
world's debt crisis. "If they try to pull out their money, it
will result in very serious problems to them," he says.
   The crux of the problems is the huge exposure of Japanese
banks. At Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., for instance, planners say
that while loans to land or real estate companies comprise
less than a fifth of the bank's $357 billion in assets, as
much as a half of all the bank's assets are in some way land
related. Much of the lending is collateralized -- but only at
about half of current property values, which provides some
security, the bank argues.
   "We are not so pessimistic that we are going to lose a lot
of money if the bubble bursts," says Kyota Ohmori, a planning
official. The stock market is less sure; Mitsubishi's share
prices has dropped to 1,550 yen from 3,310 yen at the end of
1989.
   Besides, others warn, if banks try to sell property, they
will unleash an avalanche of stock and property selling by
nervous investors, who want to avoid being caught with big
losses. "The Japanese financial institutions are locked in a
trap because of mismanagement, and mismanagement of economic
policy," says LTCB's Mr. Ueda.
   Indeed, even officials at the Bank of Japan, who take some
of the blame for the "easy money" environment that fueled the
boom in land prices, fret about the implications for Japan's
financial system. "If there is a too-steep decline (in land
prices), there is . . . a problem" for financial
institutions, one senior central bank official says. But, he
adds, higher interest rates are beginning to bring land
prices under control, though he emphasizes they are not yet
to the point of causing a property-market crash.
   In addition, the government is considering proposals to
modify its land-tax policies to discourage land-hoarding and
increase the supply of property on the market. The Bank of
Japan official says there is "considerable pressure" on
politicians to bring land prices under control, before there
is a crash.
   Ironically, those very proposals are now being cited by
some in the stock market as the reason land-related stocks
aren't recovering.
   Still, says Kermit L. Schoenholtz, an economist at Salomon
Brothers Asia Inc., a real crash of the property market --
and not just property stocks -- is still a ways off.
"People's expectations are getting ahead of reality," he
says.

   GM's New Contract
   With UAW May Be
   Ratified by Sunday

   FLINT, Mich. -- The tentative labor pact between General
Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union is sailing
through ratification by the union's rank and file, and could
win final approval by Sunday.
   Ratification of the GM pact will likely trigger the start
of negotiations between the union and Ford Motor Co. On
Monday, the UAW is expected to discuss its next moves in
talks with Ford and Chrysler Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though many of the 155 locals haven't voted on the pact
yet, the outlook for passage is good. UAW members were
approving the accord by majorities in excess of 90% at some
plants. Even in the strongholds of factions opposed to the
current UAW leadership, the pact is passing by wide margins.
Workers at a Pontiac complex voted nearly 4-to-1 in favor of
the pact, even though their dissident leadership opposed the
agreement.
   The strong support for the proposed GM pact shows that GM
and the UAW may be moving away from the strained relations
that marked the past several years and toward an era of
relative peace.
   But GM will pay handsomely for smoother relations with its
blue-collar work force. Under the pact, GM is pledging up to
$4 billion to pay wages and benefits for workers it lays off
during the life of the agreement. The auto maker will also
spend heavily to sweeten pension and early retirement
benefits aimed at encouraging its older workers to retire.
   GM officials acknowledge the pact is in part a bet that
the No. 1 auto maker's U.S. sales won't drop substantially
more than they have in the past decade. "If sales are
maintained, it's a liveable agreement," said a GM executive.
If not, "Then we're going to be in a hurt," he added.
   GM workers, however, seem satisfied that the agreement
gives them protection regardless of what happens to sales.
   "There is no doubt that this is going to pass
overwhelmingly," said Kenneth Scott, the top UAW official at
GM's Buick City auto complex. Mr. Scott said that he's
certain the 13,000 members in his local will vote in favor of
the pact, despite a large dissident presence in the local's
factories.
   Mr. Scott said the new pact is finding favor among workers
because it has something for all classes of workers: Bigger
pensions for current and future retirees; more income
security for younger workers, who often endure lengthy
layoffs; and a small wage increase plus future cost of living
increases.
   After GM workers ratify the pact, UAW bargainers are
expected to ask Ford to accept nearly identical terms.
Negotiations with Ford could start early next week. Ford
officials have said they could accept an agreement similar to
the GM pact, but want modifications allowing them to run
their plants on overtime schedules without having to pay the
steep penalty the GM agreement requires.
   The UAW is expected to save Chrysler for last and thus
defer a possible showdown with the No. 3 auto maker. Chrysler
has insisted that it can't afford a pact modeled on the GM
agreement. UAW officials have said they won't break their
pattern bargaining strategy to benefit Chrysler.

   SE Banken's Ramfors Thrives on Change

   STOCKHOLM -- Bo Ramfors says he spent a decade as a senior
executive at Scandinavia's biggest bank "moving very
comfortably in the shadow of big men."
   So much so that the affable 54-year-old banker was an
unknown quantity when management upheaval catapulted him last
year into the chief executive officer's job at Sweden's
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. Many analysts viewed Mr.
Ramfors as an interim choice to head the bank. After all, it
was well known among Stockholm's tight-knit financial
fraternity that he had reserved the right to retire from the
bank at age 55.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Mr. Ramfors has surprised just about everybody, and
right now retirement is the last thing on his mind. Seizing
the reins with obvious relish, he pushed through a sweeping
management shake-up, scrapping SE Banken's unwieldy
collective management and taking over executive power
himself.
   With assets of 360 billion Swedish kronor ($62.4 billion),
SE Banken is one of the world's 100 biggest banks. For three
consecutive years, beginning in 1986, it was the world's most
profitable, according to annual rankings prepared by London
rating agency IBCA Banking Analysis Ltd.
   However, profitability has slipped during the past 18
months, and Mr. Ramfors frets that times are about to get
even tougher. So he's ordered a cost-cutting drive aimed at
slashing overhead in the bank's domestic operations between
8% and 12% during the next 18 months.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Ramfors is stepping up the pace of SE
Banken's international expansion. Three months ago, the bank
agreed to pay #153 million ($286.1 million) for the 78% it
didn't already own of Scandinavian Bank Group PLC of London.
SE Banken's biggest acquisition in years, it also was an
important step toward broadening the operational base of
Enskilda Securities, SE Banken's London-based merchant
banking unit and the spearhead for Mr. Ramfors's
international ambitions.
   For all that activity, Mr. Ramfors has kept quiet about
what some consider his most impressive accomplishment so far
-- healing a longtime breach between SE Banken's dominant
shareholders. Relations have been sour between the bank's
biggest owners -- Sweden's Wallenberg group and the corporate
alliance of automaker AB Volvo and contracting group Skanska
AB -- since a bitter power struggle in the early 1980s.
   The big owners have become increasingly worried about the
bank's sluggish profitability -- and appalled by the
plummeting price of SE Banken shares. In a series of secret
meetings this summer, Mr. Ramfors and his major shareholders
huddled to hone the management restructuring plan. That
cooperation smoothed acceptance of the plan from the bank's
full 43-member board, as well as the quartet of managing
directors, who saw much of their previous power usurped.
   Staunch support from the big owners promises to be a trump
card as Mr. Ramfors struggles to squeeze better performance
from the bank.
   SE Banken's management woes turned acute last autumn.
Jacob Palmstierna, an urbane aristocrat hand-picked to run
the bank, resigned under pressure of allegations of tax
evasion after serving as chief executive officer less than
six months. (A Stockholm appeals court acquitted Mr.
Palmstierna of tax evasion charges earlier this month. Mr.
Palmstierna isn't expected to return to the bank.)
   The loss of Mr. Palmstierna was a double blow. He had been
expected to run the bank through the 1990s. More importantly,
his departure upset the balance among the four managing
directors who made up the bank's executive committee.
   The committee wielded power collectively. The system, and
veto powers granted each managing director, dated from the
1970 merger that created SE Banken. The system prevented
either merger partner from steamrolling the other.
   Unfortunately, the consensus system proved virtually
impossible to dismantle. One reason was the bank's ponderous
board structure: 36 directors and deputies elected by
shareholders plus seven more state appointees. The bottleneck
choked decision-making.
   The atmosphere of crisis stirred by Mr. Palmstierna's
forced departure helped pave the way for change at the bank,
SE Banken insiders say. "But Mr. Ramfors surprised everyone
by really bulldozing this through. He went to the big owners
with an ultimatum -- make changes or he'd leave," says a
senior SE Banken official.
   The owners couldn't afford to lose another chief executive
officer so soon after Mr. Palmstierna's departure. Moreover,
they shared Mr. Ramfors's concern about the bank's prospects.
   Operating profit at the parent bank climbed a modest 6%
during this year's first four months after remaining flat
last year at about 3.6 billion Swedish kronor. Reflecting the
problems, SE Banken's Series A shares -- the most traded
class of equity -- have plunged 33% over the past 12 months.
   "SE Banken just hasn't been professionally run," says a
senior official at a rival Stockholm bank. "If you look at
their client base, by far the strongest in Sweden, it's
obvious that if they were well managed, annual profit would
be at least 50% higher."
   Mr. Ramfors is concerned that the bank's hefty profit in
recent years was swelled by unique, windfall factors.
Sweeping market deregulation enabled Swedish banks to post
huge bond trading profits, he says. In addition, abolition of
longtime quotas on bank lending ushered in a burst of
unprecedented credit expansion, and favorable interest rate
movements swelled margins on banks' lending.
   The coming decade, he insists, will be a different story.
SE Banken still earns virtually all its profit from
traditional commercial banking inside Sweden. Yet Mr. Ramfors
expects Sweden's economy to reap only marginal benefits from
the European Community's 1992 single-market plan. Meanwhile,
political constraints and Sweden's huge public sector will
continue to damp economic growth at home.
   Credit expansion, he adds, probably will slow to about the
same rate as Swedish inflation from its heady 20% to 30%
annual growth rates in recent years. And the current
segregation of banks and insurers will cease, sharpening
competition for insurance and other consumer-oriented
financial services, which Mr. Ramfors expects to be virtually
the only source of growth for domestic operations.
   "That sets the '90s for us," he says. "We won't see growth
in the economy, and we won't see growth in banks."
   Operations outside Sweden will have to pick up the slack.
Though wary of fierce competition in many segments of
international banking, Mr. Ramfors says SE Banken "will
follow our customers abroad in the profitable segments where
we have competence." He cites two potential areas in
particular -- fund management and corporate finance,
including cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Enskilda
Securities has gradually carved out profitable international
niches in both fields.
   "We know there's a hell of a battle underway in Europe,"
Mr. Ramfors says. And at least for the time being, he rules
out interest in a major acquisition within the EC. "But since
we've got a first-class customer base, which not too many
banks have, we'd be stupid not to try. As long as it doesn't
take too much capital, why can't Swedes do it? That's my
approach."

   Weak Orders in Second Half
   Of 1989, Early 1990 Led
   To Depressed Shipments

   Machine-tool producers will report dismal third quarter
profits. Shipments were depressed because of weak orders in
1989's second half and the first few months of 1990.
   Machine tools are large, complex machines that shape metal
parts, and there often is a lead time of several months to a
year between receipt of an order and shipment of the machine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The industry also is beset by intensely competitive
pricing. There's excess capacity in the U.S. machine-tool
industry, and foreign producers are shipping in machines from
abroad and adding plant capacity in the U.S.
   Nonetheless, "the tone at the recent machine tool show in
Chicago was quite upbeat," said Eli S. Lustgarten, machinery
analyst with PaineWebber. "Industry orders for 1990 will be
up 4% to 6% from last year, and they'll rise another 5% to
10% next year," he said. That's far from a boom, he added,
but it should produce improved industry profits in 1991.
   For one thing, automotive companies are expected to place
some long-deferred orders for equipment to produce new
engines and other basic parts for 1993 and 1994 model cars.
"The stumbling blocks that delayed the orders are falling,"
Mr. Lustgarten said, and auto makers don't have much more
time, if they want to avoid slipping another year behind the
Japanese in car design.
   Order deferral by car and truck makers was a major reason
for the machine tool order drop that began in the spring of
1989.
   The declining value of the dollar is one of this year's
few plus factors. Machine-tool exports in 1990's first half
rose 17% from a year earlier, and may set a record for the
full year, exceeding the $1 billion of 1981, according to the
NMTBA -- the Association for Manufacturing Technology, a
McLean, Va., trade group.
   The machine-tool industry isn't energy-intensive, and
won't be hurt directly by higher oil prices. However, orders
would drop if rising oil prices and uncertainty about the
threat of war in the Middle East bring on a recession in the
U.S. and slow economic activity abroad.
   On the other hand, machine-tool companies are receiving
more orders from makers of oilfield drilling equipment, pumps
and valves as oil prices rise and demand for natural gas
increases.
   In addition, higher gasoline prices may increase auto
company purchases of equipment to make new 16-valve,
four-cylinder engines and four-speed automatic transmissions.
The auto industry has been undecided about whether to make
more six-cylinder engines for larger, higher performance
cars, or to tool up for fuel-efficient models.
   Government fuel-economy regulations pressure the companies
to emphasize economy, but consumer demand was tilting
strongly toward performance. Higher gasoline prices could
resolve the issue in favor of economy.
   Longer term, if oil prices remain high, U.S. industry will
renew efforts to conserve energy, such as operating more
fuel-efficient trucks, airplanes and heavy machinery. That
would boost orders for machine tools in 1991 and beyond.
   In the third quarter, negatives outweighed the positives.
Cincinnati Milacron Inc. said it's too early to make a
precise third-quarter earnings estimate, but that profit
probably will be in the ballpark of the disappointing 12
cents a share earned in the second quarter. In 1989's third
period, when Milacron was feeling the brunt of restructuring
problems, profit from continuing operations was $3.3 million,
or 13 cents a share, on sales of $233.8 million. Net income
was $2.5 million, or 10 cents a share.
   Milacron's profit in recent quarters has suffered from
reduced shipments of some of its higher margin products, such
as plastics-injection molding machines. Also, the company is
shipping some machines that carry inadequate profit margins,
reflecting competitive pricing. Milacron has become more
selective about the business it accepts, a spokesman said,
but still has some low-margin business on the books.
   Monarch Machine Tool Co., Sidney, Ohio, also is having a
disappointing third quarter, mainly because of reduced orders
during the spring and summer, said Robert J. Siewert,
president. The producer of lathes, machining centers and
equipment for processing coils of sheet metal will be
profitable for the quarter, he said, but it's too early to
say whether net will exceed the modest $271,942, or seven
cents a share, Monarch earned a year ago on $24 million
revenue.
   Monarch began the year expecting sharply higher profit in
1990, but second and third-quarter earnings fell far below
expectations, Mr. Siewert said. The company's British lathe
operation had lower shipments at the same time that domestic
machine-tool business was in a slump. Orders have improved
recently, he said, and the fourth quarter will be the best
earnings period for the year.
   Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc., Fond du Lac, Wis., is faring better
than most other machine-tool builders this year; it expects
to approximate last year's third-quarter net of $4.8 million,
or 46 cents a share. "Our bookings have held up, and we have
a good backlog," said Richard Kleinfeldt, vice president and
chief financial officer. He doesn't quarrel with analyst
estimates that the company will earn $1.80 to $1.85 a share
for the year, up from $17.1 million, or $1.65 a share, in
1989, when sales were $233.1 million.
   Cross &amp; Trecker Corp. concedes that it won't realize a
previously announced goal of turning profitable in fiscal
1990, which ends Sunday. The Bloomfield Hills, Mich., company
expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter larger than
the year-ago quarter's loss of $1 million, or eight cents a
share. However, fiscal 1990's loss will be far smaller than
the loss of $46.5 million, or $3.76 a share, for all of
fiscal 1989, which included a restructuring charge of $21.3
million.
   Reduced orders at the KT-Swasey unit, which produces
machining centers and lathes, and at the Sheffield measuring
machine unit, are major factors in the expected
fourth-quarter loss, Cross &amp; Trecker said. Sheffield is
profitable, but will earn less than a year ago.
   In addition, Cross has had difficulty in arranging
financing for a large Soviet order. Last March, Cross
received Soviet orders totaling $63 million for machinery to
equip a Soviet auto plant. West German banks agreed to
finance the $28 million portion of the order placed with the
Cross plant in West Germany. However, U.S. banks won't
finance the $35 million part that was to be produced in
Michigan, delaying the program, Cross said. U.S. banks are
skittish about whether the Soviets would make the repayments.
   The company accounts for large contracts on a percentage
of completion basis, and had expected to book as much as
$700,000 of operating profit from the Soviet order in the
Sept. 30 quarter. Cross may transfer production to another
country to obtain financing, possibly reopening a Canadian
facility.
   The order slowdown hit Hurco Cos., Indianapolis, just as
the producer of machining centers and electronic controls was
increasing spending on new-product development and its
marketing and customer-service organization. This year, Hurco
introduced a new generation of machine-tool controls and will
market five new machine tools, said Michael K. Campbell,
senior vice president and chief financial officer.
   Hurco's profit in the third quarter, ended July 31,
plunged to $1.1 million, or 19 cents a share, from $2.2
million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. The company
expects net for the Oct. 31 fourth quarter to approximate the
third period's, which would be less than half the $2.9
million, or 51 cents a share, earned in the year-ago quarter.
   However, Hurco could exceed a fiscal 1990 earnings
estimate of $1.20 a share if sales in the final weeks of the
year keep pace with a recent increase in customer inquiries,
Mr. Campbell said.
   For fiscal 1989, Hurco earned a record $8.2 million, or
$1.70 a share, on sales of $93.7 million.

   In what was heralded as a landmark step, Governor Mario
Cuomo and New York City Mayor David N. Dinkins recently
announced a new plan to aid the mentally ill homeless.
Nowadays when politicians announce progressive new programs
for the mentally ill, sensible people start to worry -- with
cause.
   The track record of such programs, beginning with the
catastrophic one that "liberated" the mentally ill by
removing them from institutions that cared for them, is not
reassuring. Thanks to this grand remedy conceived in the name
of progress in the late 1960s, a huge army of severely sick
and dependent people now make their home in the streets. How
they got there is no mystery.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Public-interest attorneys and civil libertarians, rushing
to the barricades of what they saw as a great new
civil-rights movement, mounted a war of lawsuits against
state mental hospitals all through the '70s. Such advocates
pressed demands for patient liberation, and for rights
including a mentally ill person's right to refuse treatment.
The result of these efforts was the phenomenon known as
deinstitutionalization.
   The mental hospitals emptied out while the nation's bus
terminals, parks and subway gratings filled up with hordes of
the afflicted now free to wander where they would, untended.
An army of psychotic and delusional people had been released
to a freedom that was, in effect, their abandonment.
   The architects of deinstitutionalization now concede that
it has been a calamitous failure but argue that this is only
because of the government's failure to provide supporting
funds for outpatient clinics and group homes. It is an
argument that fails to address the core problem of the
mentally ill.
   That problem, simply put, is that the mentally ill require
treatment which they are incapable of seeking for themselves.
All the funds and group homes in the world are of no avail so
long as residents can wander as they please and refuse
medication. A new book titled "Madness In the Street" by Rael
Jean Isaac and Virginia C. Armat argues that when the
diseased organ is the brain, afflicted individuals can't be
expected to make reasoned decisions regarding treatment. As
author Isaac told us, "at least half the mentally ill don't
think there is anything wrong with them."
   Governor Cuomo and Mayor Dinkins now have introduced a
housing program for the mentally ill, based on the model of
residences run by Franciscan priests. They are models well
worth emulating. A visitor to their residences discovers
clean, cheery homes closely supervised by caretaker priests
and medical attendants who make it a priority to see that the
residents take their anti-psychotic drugs. The priests remove
and try to hospitalize anyone who refuses to take the
stablizing medication.
   The question posed by the Cuomo-Dinkins plan is whether
state-run bureaucracies hamstrung by worries about lawsuits
can or will emulate the successful voluntary efforts of the
Franciscans. Those who favor publicly administered support
for such problems must answer the question of whether
government has become so encumbered -- by politicians,
lawyers, pressure groups, TV cameras -- that it simply can no
longer perform these tasks effectively.
   The legal tangle produced by the patients' rights
advocates is such that it is now nearly impossible to commit
patients involuntarily, without offering the most compelling
and extreme proof that they pose a danger to themselves or
others. State hospitals now can hardly be persuaded even to
take people who wish to be committed, unless they can prove
they are dangerous to themselves or others. Mental illness is
apparently the only disease requiring the sufferer to reach
the worst stage before he is considered eligible for
treatment. There is something wrong with this situation.
   The chaos in the homeless shelters and terminals where the
mentally ill gather testifies to the results. Most of the
mentally ill are not violence prone, but the segment that is
poses dangers not to be ignored. Arrest rates for violent
crimes are now consistently higher for the mentally ill than
for that of the general population. This can hardly be
surprising in a wandering population no longer in a position
where they can be given the anti-psychotic medication needed
to help and stabilize them.
   It is clearly time to start reordering priorities and to
begin rethinking the complex of recently litigated legal
rights whose primary effect is to prevent gravely ill people
from receiving treatment. It's time to start hospitalizing
people who need it, and to recognize that creating a right
that allows extremely disturbed people to refuse treatment
amounts to the right to live in degradation.

   NEW YORK -- Recession fears intensified in the financial
markets, and investors bought up Treasury securities and
dumped stocks, especially bank issues.
   The dollar closed narrowly mixed against key currencies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 32.17 points lower
to 2427.48, the lowest close since May 1989. New York Stock
Exchange volume of 182,690,000 shares was the heaviest this
week.
   The stock market's decline sent some investors into
short-term Treasury securities, whose prices remained firm.
But long-term U.S. bonds jumped -- the 30-year Treasury bond
rose 1 point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount -- as some
traders decided the shock of sharply higher oil prices will
eventually deepen a recession that will bring about low
inflation and lower interest rates.
   Stocks swung widely, reflecting an equally volatile crude
oil market. Most stocks opened higher as traders anticipated
a decline in energy prices following President Bush's pledge
to draw oil from strategic reserves to cool the price
advance. Oil prices did drop at first, but rumors about a
Mideast shooting war caused prices to start climbing,
knocking stocks into a steep slide; the Dow Jones industrials
fell as many as 50 points. November crude oil futures closed
87 cents higher at $39.54 a barrel.
   Traders and investors were transfixed by the big declines
and heavy volume in stocks of many of the largest U.S. banks.
   Citicorp, for example, fell 3/4 to 13 3/4 with 4.2 million
shares changing hands, making it the most active issue on the
Big Board.
   Besides large New York bank issues, shares of regional
banks and insurance companies were hit, too. The selling
wasn't panicky, but traders said it reflected investors'
deepening pessimism about the U.S. financial sector.
   Institutional investors have been shedding financial
issues "for months, not days," said John Conlon, managing
director in charge of equity trading at Rothschild Inc. But
dividend cuts by Chase Manhattan last week and by Bank of
Boston yesterday have intensified investors' cynicism.
   "This market is taking down pretty stocks and ugly
stocks," said William Kufta, senior vice president at
Pitcairn Financial Management. "There is a meltdown of
confidence."
   Even stalwart "safe growth" stocks such as Becton
Dickinson were hit with selling pressure. Shares of the
medical supplies concern fell 1 3/4 to 65.
   Currency trading was thin as institutions began to close
their books for the third quarter, traders said.
   In major market activity:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks closed sharply lower. The Big Board's composite
index of all its listed shares fell 2.16 to 165.36, the
lowest close since March 1989. Only 395 issues gained on the
Big Board while 1,182 declined.
                                                                                                       

   Bonds finished sharply higher. The yield on the benchmark
30-year bond slid to 9.01%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar finished mixed. In late New York trading, the
dollar was quoted at 1.5612 marks and 138.00 yen compared
with 1.5650 marks and 136.84 yen Wednesday.

   Colonial Realty Corp., the embattled West Hartford, Conn.,
real estate syndicator, got a reprieve yesterday when a
petition for involuntary bankruptcy-court liquidation of the
company was converted into a Chapter 11 reorganization.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Robert Krechevsky approved a
request by Colonial's lawyers to convert the Chapter 7
petition, which was filed on Sept. 14 by six banks. The
banks, including a unit of Bank of New England Corp. and
People's Bank of Bridgeport, did not oppose the conversion.

   Colonial, which is closely held, has marketed limited

billion.
   "Obviously, this is in the best interests of the investors
and of the company," said Colonial spokesman Tom Drohan.
   John Nolan, a Hartford lawyer who represents one of the
banks, said that a creditors commitee had been formed, which
would seek court approval to hire Coopers &amp; Lybrand to
examine the company's books.

   Your Money Matters:
   Short Sellers Making Tall Profits
   In Stock Market's Current Decline

   With stock prices drifting lower almost daily, an
increasing number of investors are trying to cash in by
"selling short."
   That's a strategy for making money on bad news. Instead of
buying a stock and hoping that the price will rise, short
sellers borrow a stock and immediately sell it, hoping the
price will decline. Eventually, these "shorts" have to buy
shares to replace the ones they borrowed, but if the price
drops enough in the meantime, they make a profit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some short sellers "are making a great deal of money" in
the current market, says Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice
president at Charles Schwab &amp; Co. The discount brokerage firm
reports that its number of shares of stock borrowed, an
indicator of short selling, is up 15% since July.
"Sophisticated investors are shorting more stocks," says Mr.
Quackenbush.
   Short selling isn't for everyone, however. The danger is
that the price of the stock will rise instead fall, causing
investors to lose money -- and the size of the loss is
potentially unlimited. If, for instance, an investor shorts a
stock at $20 and it rises instead to $100 or $200, the
investor will eventually have to "cover" the short sale by
purchasing the stock at the higher price.
   That makes short selling especially risky in volatile
markets, when stock prices are moving up and down sharply.
Even now, at a time when the direction of prices has been
mostly down, some advisers see danger.
   Stan Weinstein, editor of the Professional Tape Reader, a
Hollywood, Fla., newsletter, says it doesn't make sense "to
do aggressive shorting" after a 500-point decline in the
market. "There are bound to be some oversold rallies in this
bear market," he says, advising would-be short sellers to
wait until the market moves higher.
   The nature of short selling also eliminates a usual
benefit of stocks -- receiving a dividend. Indeed, dividends
are an additional expense because the short seller must pay
any dividends that the company declares to the person he
borrowed the stock from.
   Still a number of investment professionals say that short
selling can be worth a try for someone willing to take the
risks, do the homework, and stay on top of daily
developments. "Selling short makes fantastic money in down
markets," says Neil Dolinsky, a portfolio manager at C.C.
Dunnavan &amp; Co., a Minneapolis money management firm.
   "We always say the trend is your friend," says John
Brooks, a technical analyst at Davis Mendel &amp; Regenstein, an
Atlanta brokerage firm. "Well the trend is down, and
{investors} should go with the flow -- at least for part of
their portfolio."
   Mr. Brooks suggests looking for short-sale candidates
among companies with weak earnings, heavy insider selling and
share prices below their 200-day moving averages. "In this
kind of market, the weak get weaker. You will have plenty of
candidates. Very few fish will swim upstream," Mr. Brooks
says.
   Sifting through the short-sale candidates requires
investors to do more of their own research than if they were
looking for stocks to buy, or "go long," says Michael Murphy,
editor of Overpriced Stock Service, a San Francisco short
selling newsletter. "On the long side, companies, brokerage
firms, public relations agencies and investment bankers will
give you all kinds of help in finding underpriced stocks."
But on the short side, "they will give you no help."
   But that's also a plus, Mr. Murphy says. Instead of
competing with thousands of analysts, brokers and money
managers searching for underpriced stocks, individuals are
operating in "a relatively inefficient part of the stock
market" competing with a small group of short selling pros,
he says.
   For those who want try to make some money on the short
side, here are some tips on minimizing the risks involved:
                                                                                                       

   DON'T GO OVERBOARD. Mr. Murphy recommends that individual
investors devote only a small percentage of their capital to
short selling. Mr. Weinstein suggests that investors
diversify their short sales with six to 10 different stocks.
                                                                                                       

   LIMIT LOSSES. To reduce the potential loss if the price of
a shorted stock goes up instead of down, some pros suggest
"stop-buy" orders. These are instructions to your broker to
buy the stock when it reaches a price of, say 10% to 25% over
the price you shorted the stock at. "You have to be able to
protect yourself if the stock runs away on the upside," says
Mr. Quackenbush of Charles Schwab.
   Mr. Murphy says he sets a 25% stop-buy order on his
shorts. "If our analysis is wrong or our timing is off, we
are better off taking a 25% loss, coming back later with
fresh eyes, and seeing what we want to do about it," he says.
                                                                                                       

   DODGE "SHORT SQUEEZES." A short squeeze is what happens
when the price of a heavily shorted stock rises and short
sellers have to compete against each other to buy enough
shares to cover their positions. The result can be a buying
frenzy that drives the stock price even higher with short
sellers taking heavier and heavier losses.
   In a typical short sale, brokers require investors to
deposit 50% of the market value of the shares borrowed in a
margin, or credit account, to cover potential losses. If the
stock's price rises, investors will get "margin" calls to put
in more money whenever the deposit falls below a certain
percentage of the stock's market value.
   One way to dodge a short squeeze is to avoid thinly traded
stocks, says Mr. Quackenbush. "Individuals should stay away
from a stock with {only} 200,000 shares outstanding, for
example," he adds.
   Mr. Murphy says it's also a good idea for individual
investors to avoid trying to short the stocks with the
largest "short interest" -- the number of shares that haven't
yet been purchased for return to lenders. "That's a
professional's game -- a war between the shorts and longs,"
he says, and "it's best to say out of those contests."
                                                                                                       

   AVOID EMOTIONAL HANGUPS. Finally, the pros say, investors
who short a stock shouldn't feel that they are doing
something unethical. "When you buy a stock long, you feel
like you've purchased a piece of America," says Mr. Brooks,
the Atlanta brokerage-firm analyst. But that doesn't mean
that shorting a stock is un-American, he and others say.
   Indeed, Mr. Murphy adds, "By pushing overpriced stocks
down, short selling makes capital markets more efficient."

   A federal judge in Birmingham, Ala., fined USX Corp. $4.1
million for conspiring to influence unfairly a concessionary
labor contract in 1983.
   The fine was the maximum penalty USX could have received
after its conviction in July on 14 criminal counts in
connection with its talks with the United Steelworkers union
to reopen its idled Fairfield works near Birmingham.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government said USX influenced two union officials by
arranging for their pensions to be enriched beyond what they
would have received as regular company employees.
   The case stemmed from 1983 labor negotiations when USX,
then U.S. Steel Corp., sought substantial concessions from
steelworkers to reopen the idled Fairfield works. A number of
workers allege that they lost income because of the pact.
   The convictions have been seen as a strain on tense
negotiations between the union and USX, the nation's largest
steelmaker. They also could hurt the union's credibility
among some rank and file members.
   USX was also ordered to pay restitution of $289,995 to two
pension funds that prosecutors claimed were depleted because
of the pension increases.
   The two union officials, E.B. Rich, 60, and Thermon
Phillips, 62, who were also convicted in July, were
sentenced, but remain free on bond pending their appeals. Mr.
Rich received three years in jail plus three years probation
and a $6,000 fine. Mr. Phillips received 30 months in jail
plus two years probation and a $6,000 fine.
   A USX spokesman said the company plans to appeal. USX has
said there was "clear error in the conduct of the trial which
will lead to a reversal of the verdicts."
   Steelworkers president Lynn R. Williams said "we believe
the conviction will be reversed." The union has said the
practice of providing such pensions for union representatives
is widespread in U.S. industry. A Department of Labor survey
has found that 62% of U.S. manufacturers provide such
benefits to labor representatives even though they are
employed by unions.
   The union said Mr. Phillips's post as director of
Steelworkers' District 36 will be temporarily filled by
Richard H. Davis, an administrative assistant at the
international union, pending Mr. Phillips's appeal. Mr. Rich,
a subdistrict director in Alabama, is retiring from his post.
No successor was named.

   JURORS CHOSEN in Mapplethorpe obscenity case.
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys in the obscenity and
child nudity case against Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts
Center and its director settled on a jury of four men and
four women, ending four days of jury selection.
   The case is the first ever in the U.S. in which a museum
has been charged with obscenity. The charges center on seven
photographs in an exhibit of 175 works by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe.
   None of the eight jurors or the two alternate jurors
selected had heard of the artist before April or seen his
retrospective exhibit. Only two, a sales associate at a
sporting goods outlet and an export coordinator for Procter &amp;
Gamble, live in the city. The rest, including a warehouse
manager, a data processor, an electrical engineer, a
secretary, hospital quality control specialist and a systems
technician for Cincinnnati Bell Telephone Co. live in the
conservative suburbs. At least four have been active church
members.
   Hamilton County Municipal Judge David H. Albanese has
asked reporters covering the trial not to publish the names
of the jurors because of possible harassment. Defense lawyers
declined to comment on the jury pool.
   Jury selection is considered by many trial lawyers to be
the most important part of a trial, but the makeup of the
jury will have added significance in this case. The law
regarding obscenity hinges on whether the material in
question falls within average and acceptable community
standards or whether it appeals purely to prurient interest
and has no redeeming literary or artistic merit. Jurors in
this case will act as the conscience of their community and
pass judgment on what their community's standards should be.
   Throughout the jury selection, Hamilton County's chief
prosecutor, Frank Prouty, systematically weeded out potential
jurors who indicated an interest in art or in visiting art
galleries and museums.
   None of the jurors has ever been to the Center for
Contemporary Arts, and one hasn't been to an art gallery or
museum since grade school.
   Opening arguments in the case are set to begin this
morning.
   The photos in question -- five depicting homoerotic and
sadomasochistic images and two in which children posed with
their genitals exposed -- caused a furor here when the show
opened in April. The center and its director, Dennis Barrie,
are each charged with one misdemeanor count of pandering and
one misdemeanor count of using a minor in material with
nudity.

   FORMER S&amp;L EXECUTIVE pleads guilty to federal bank fraud
and tax evasion.
   Donald Moskowitz, former president, chief executive
officer and chairman of United Savings Bank in Paterson,
N.J., admitted in federal court in Newark, N.J., that he used
bank funds to pay for personal expenses, took kickbacks from
loan customers and bank suppliers and evaded more than
$40,000 in personal income taxes. Judge Alfred M. Wolin
accepted his plea.
   Mr. Moskowitz, who faces a maximum of 30 years in prison,
restitution and $1,350,000 in fines, misappropriated $325,000
in bank funds for personal use. He also estimated that the
fraud cost the bank between $2 million to $2.5 million.
   According to Stuart Rabner, an assistant U.S. attorney,
United Savings Bank is one of the nation's top 100
fraud-ridden thrifts. The Resolution Trust Corporation took
over the bank in May.
   "Obviously, his misappropriation of bank funds . . .

Moskowitz's attorney, Edward Fitzpatrick, could not be

   JUDGE REFUSES to limit SEC's questioning of German broker.
   The broker, Hans-Jurgen Klisch, is a defendant in the
Securities and Exchange Commission's civil suit alleging
insider-trading in connection with GTE Corp.'s merger with
Contel Corp. The $6.2 billion merger was announced July 12.
Mr. Klisch and others are charged with trading Contel
securities based on inside information about the merger.
   Mr. Klisch, a broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Dusseldorf, West Germany, had asked federal Judge Charles
Haight in Manhattan to restrict the scope of the SEC's
questioning. Mr. Klisch said he feared the SEC would ask him
about his brokerage clients, which he said could lead to
violations of German law on disclosing information about bank
customers.
   Judge Haight, however, ruled that because Mr. Klisch would
face civil, rather than criminal, penalties for such
disclosures, the SEC couldn't be restricted.
   The deposition of Mr. Klisch was scheduled for today in
Dusseldorf.

"helps the firm meet its responsibilities to the community
and helps younger lawyers improve their skills as advocates."

   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- In 1981, Lemmie Ruffin sold an
insurance policy to Cleopatra Haslip's employer. Now, that
simple transaction has led the Supreme Court to confront one
of the most critical legal issues involving American
business: whether the Constitution requires limits on
punitive damages.
   On one side is Mr. Ruffin's former employer, Pacific
Mutual Life Insurance Co., located in stylish Newport Beach,
Calif., with $1.58 billion in premiums last year. On the
other is 59-year-old Mrs. Haslip, the former $8,800-a-year
librarian for Roosevelt City, a poor, largely black suburb in
the old steel mill region west of here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In 1982, only months after the insurance policy was
purchased, Mrs. Haslip found herself with a kidney infection
-- and uninsured for $3,500 in medical bills. In a lawsuit
charging that Mr. Ruffin, as a Pacific Mutual agent, had
defrauded her and three co-workers, a Birmingham jury ordered
Pacific Mutual to pay $1,077,978, with most of it intended to
punish the company.
   In its new term, which begins Monday, the Supreme Court
will use the case to decide whether, under the 14th
Amendment's "due process" guarantee, juries must be given
standards to guide their decisions on when and how much
punitive damages are appropriate. The case is scheduled to be
argued next Wednesday.
   For business, which complains bitterly that unreasonable
punitive jury verdicts are running rampant, the case will be
one of the most closely watched of the year. Briefs have been
filed by the pharmaceutical, wholesale, insurance, medical,
accounting and news industries, as well as the Business
Roundtable, U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Corporate
Counsel Association.
   "American business faces a world of unended, unbounded
threat of punitive damages with no guidelines that are really
tangible," says Victor Schwartz, a Washington lawyer who is
counsel to the Product Liability Alliance, a coalition of
manufacturers, wholesalers and trade groups.
   Mr. Schwartz argues that "the threat of punitive damages
keeps good products off the market," even slowing development
and marketing of an AIDS vaccine, defibrillators and other
medical devices. And, he says, companies find "their credit
is threatened if they have big damage judgments pending
against them," because in most states insurance doesn't cover
punitive damages, and companies must cover the expense
themselves. In a small company, that could be fatal.
   But consumer groups and lawyers who represent plaintiffs
in lawsuits for damages say they see no need for the Supreme
Court to meddle in the laws of the 50 states. "You do not
talk to companies unless you talk to their pocketbooks," John
Whitaker, a Birmingham lawyer for Mrs. Haslip, told the jury
in her case.
   "Punitive damages are a very effective tool to curb
outrageous misconduct by companies," says Linda Lipsen of
Consumers Union of United States. "We recognize that these
awards can hurt, and they should hurt because they are
punishment. You can't tell a major corporation to go to its
room." Far from deterring major new products, she contends,
"Punitive damages drive from the market dangerous products.
They encourage innovation and responsibility for creating
better products."
   Business interests cite numerous examples of big punitive
damage awards as evidence of problems in the system. Last
year, an insurance salesman in Clearwater, Fla., won $1
million in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive
damages from John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. for
defaming him, according to Lawyers Alert, a Boston magazine.
In July, a research scientist who was fired for protesting
the alleged failure of Syntex Corp. to disclose side effects
of an anti-ulcer drug won $15 million in punitive damages, on
top of $2.5 million in compensatory damages.
   But if the persistence of business complaints about
punitive damages provides anecdotal evidence of a widespread
problem, a study published this year by the American Bar
Foundation, a research arm of the American Bar Association,
suggests the opposite. The study, which examined a total of
25,627 jury verdicts in 47 counties in 11 states from 1981
through 1985, found that punitive damages were awarded in
only 4.9% of those cases, and in 8.8% of cases won by
plaintiffs.
   The study also examined the median size of punitive
awards, rather than oft-cited averages, which it said can be
skewed by one large award. Its conclusion: in 15 of the 20
counties that had more than 10 punitive-damages awards, the
median punitive award was under $40,000; the other five
counties, all in California, had higher medians.
   But one element that makes this case especially worth
watching is that business seems to have a sympathetic ear in
the Supreme Court, which has grappled with the issue
previously but never decided it.
   Last year, in a case unsuccessfully challenging punitive
damages on other constitutional grounds, four justices --
Sandra O'Connor, John Stevens, Thurgood Marshall and the
since-retired William Brennan -- expressed concern that
juries' unlimited discretion to make awards might violate the
due-process guarantee, which requires some standards and
procedural fairness before people and companies can be
deprived of their property. And in another case, decided in
1988, Justice Antonin Scalia joined a concurring opinion by
Justice O'Connor that questioned juries' "wholly standardless
discretion."
   If the justices find themselves deadlocked 4-4 on the
Pacific Mutual case, they might order it reargued after the
arrival of David Souter, whose nomination to the court is
expected to win Senate approval next week. Little is known
about his view of punitive damages.
   In some ways, the Pacific Mutual case seems an unlikely
vehicle for the court to use to decide the punitive-damages
issue. The complex events don't give the court a "clean" case
that turns solely on the due-process issue.
   Yet to Mrs. Haslip, the case is less about legal
abstractions than about real-life concerns. More than eight
years after the story began, she still faces more than $3,500
in unpaid medical bills, has court judgments against her for
the debt and thus has difficulty obtaining credit. "I didn't
see any alternative to the lawsuit," she says. "They weren't
going to pay my bills."
   In 1981, Mrs. Haslip, a mother of five, was the librarian
and assistant town clerk at Roosevelt City's two-story, white
stucco town hall, where she had worked for nine years. The
town, which has since been annexed by Birmingham, had lost
its old employees' insurance policy and was shopping for a
new one when it was contacted by Mr. Ruffin, the Pacific
Mutual agent.
   Mr. Ruffin signed up the employees with Pacific Mutual for
their life insurance. But because the company didn't issue
municipal group health insurance, he placed the health policy
-- with the approval of Pacific Mutual's local manager --
with a different company, Union Fidelity Life Insurance Co.,
a unit of Aon Corp.
   Mrs. Haslip testified at the 1987 trial that if she and
her fellow workers knew about Union Fidelity at all, they
believed it was part of Pacific Mutual. Every two weeks, the
town deducted $52.95 from Mrs. Haslip's take-home pay of $280
for the life and health policies.
   Using unorthodox practices described at the trial, Mr.
Ruffin presented only one bill on Pacific Mutual stationery
for both policies, collected the payments himself, and after
two months had the town make the checks out to him
personally. He also had the insurance companies send all mail
about the policies to him rather than to the policyholders.
(Mr. Ruffin hasn't been heard from by other parties in the
case for several years, and frequent calls to his last known
phone number have gone unanswered.)
   What the town and workers apparently never knew is that
after one month on the health policy and two months on the
life policy, Mr. Ruffin stopped sending in the premiums, and
the policies were canceled. "Instead of forwarding these
collected premiums to the insurers, Ruffin pocketed the
money," Bruce Ennis, a Washington lawyer for Mrs. Haslip,
says in a Supreme Court brief. Mr. Ruffin said in a
deposition and Pacific Mutual said at the trial that the town
was told that the policy was canceled, but town officials and
workers testified they never knew.
   For five months, the Roosevelt City workers continued
paying premiums on the nonexistent policies. Then, in the
middle of the night on Jan. 23, 1982, Mrs. Haslip was
admitted to the emergency room at Baptist Medical
Center-Princeton for what turned into a weeklong stay for a
kidney infection and hiatal hernia. She couldn't leave
without paying a $600 deposit on the bill, after discovering
that she was uninsured.
   "That accounted for almost everything I had," she says in
an interview. "You don't have much savings on my salary." At
first, Mrs. Haslip says, "I thought it was a mistake." But
when she called Mr. Ruffin again, he insisted there was no
mistake. "I got so angry, I was shouting at him, crying and
everything," she says.
   In May 1982, Mrs. Haslip sued Mr. Ruffin and Pacific
Mutual, on the theory that the company was responsible for
its agent's actions. The jury's verdict in her favor was
upheld both by the trial judge and, last September, by the
Alabama Supreme Court.
   But Washington lawyer Andrew Frey, who filed a brief in
the case for the Business Roundtable, argues that punitive
damages are like criminal penalties, and "there must be fair
procedures for deciding that someone can be punished and for
setting the amount." The award against Pacific Mutual, he
says, is excessive because it wasn't based on any comparable
criminal fines or on the severity of the actions.
   Because of the peculiar facts of the case, it is possible
that the court won't address the broad question of whether
limits should be placed on punitive awards; instead, the
justices could focus on the narrower question of whether the
Constitution allows an employer to be held liable for
punitive damages for an employee's actions that weren't in
line with company policy.
   But even if the justices go that route, the issue won't
fade away. Nearly a dozen more appeals of punitive-damages
cases have been filed in the Supreme Court; they are
currently on hold, awaiting the outcome of the Alabama case,
and indicate just how far-reaching the challenges to punitive
damages are. They include:
   -- An appeal by Reserve Life Insurance Co., a Sammons
Enterprises Inc. unit, of a Mississippi jury's award of
$500,000 in punitive damages for the company's failure to pay
a $6,658 medical claim;
   -- A challenge by Clayton Brokerage Co. of St. Louis, a
Garnac Grain Co. unit, to a $400,000 punitive award for
allegedly causing a $7,923 loss in a commodities-trading
account;
   -- And a petition by the Church of Scientology of
California to overturn a $2 million punitive award and
$500,000 compensatory award to a former church member who
sued, charging that church practices intentionally caused him
emotional distress.
   Among lawyers in these heated debates, there are few
disinterested parties. Plaintiffs' lawyers profit from big
damage verdicts because they typically take the cases for a
sizable percentage of the total award. But battling against
punitive damages, both in court and in the legislative arena,
has become a profitable industry for defense lawyers, who are
paid well by businesses and trade groups.
   As for Mrs. Haslip, she is still having money problems and
has yet to see a cent of the judgment. She plans to attend
the oral arguments on Wednesday, but says she hasn't much
thought about what she will do with the money if her victory
is upheld. "I try not to think that far ahead," she says,
"because I might not get it."

   American Waste's Pricing Plan
   Resisted As Mood Alters in a Few Months

   Many entrepreneurs dream of making a killing on Wall
Street by taking their firms public. But even in glamour
industries, those dreams seem more remote now than just a few
months ago.
   Consider the contrasting experiences of Mid-American Waste
Systems Inc. and American Waste Services Inc. Both are in
waste management; as public concern mounts over waste
disposal, the industry has been a Wall Street darling.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Only last May, Mid-American, based in Canal Winchester,
Ohio, had no trouble going public at $24 a share, a premium
over the underwriters' initial estimate of $19 to $21 a
share. The offering totaled $82.8 million. It gave the
company -- which earned only $1.8 million in 1989 on revenue
of $48.4 million -- an initial market valuation of more than
$220 million.
   But two-year-old American Waste, based in Youngstown,
Ohio, is meeting with resistance as it circulates a
preliminary prospectus for its offering, aimed at raising $84
million to $114 million.
   The anticipated price, according to the document, is $14
to $17 a share -- some 100 times "pro forma" earnings for
1989 (figures that factor -- in the increased number of
shares from the projected offering and the earnings from
expected acquisitions). With revenue of $37.4 million in
1989, American Waste would have a total market valuation of
more than $500 million.
   But many investors and analysts doubt the issue will fly
in that price range, even though prestigious Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co. is leading the underwriters. Several report that Goldman,
recognizing the resistance, has begun talking about a
possible price slash, perhaps to $11 a share. (Goldman
declined to comment publicly on this or other aspects of this
article.)
   Late yesterday afternoon, American Waste acknowledged the
pressure. Chairman Ronald E. Klingle said, "We're in the
process of rethinking the pricing, but we're anticipating a
successful initial public offering in the very near future."
   The underwriters issued the prospectus last month. But
until early this week, neither American Waste nor Goldman
Sachs seemed willing to lower the price. One New England
money manager complained about this; but he added that on
Tuesday Goldman asked him if he would be interested in
American Waste at $11 a share. He said no.
   A more reasonable price for the company would be $9 a
share, said Brian Stansky, an industry analyst with T. Rowe
Price Associates, a Baltimore manager of mutual funds.
Assuming American Waste in 1991 earns 65 cents a share, the
number being kicked around by analysts, the company would
have a price multiple roughly in line with the current
multiple for Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., an established
leader in the field.
   Any setback would be rare for American Waste, which has
been growing fast, largely because of financing from such
institutional investors as First Analysis Corp., Robertson,
Stephens &amp; Co. and Hambro International Venture Fund. Net
income soared to $5.3 million last year from $1.1 million in
1988. Most attractive to investors, American Waste has
sizable landfill capacity, at a time of declining overall
waste-disposal capacity in the U.S. Besides operating
landfills, the company transports waste and brokers
waste-management services.
   American Waste would use the proceeds from going public to
finance acquisitions it has negotiated, to repay debt and to
purchase equipment, among other purposes.
   But existing shareholders paid only $1.04 a share, on
average, for their stock, the prospectus concedes; and any
new shares sold at $17 would have a book value of only $3.05
apiece.
   In a stronger stock market, investors might easily
overlook such numbers. "There's no question that American
Waste could have had an easier time six months ago," said
Larry Greenberg, manager of Fidelity Select Environmental
Service Portfolio, a Boston mutual fund. Indeed, the
confrontation with Iraq, the sagging economy and other
factors have battered the stock market. And the formerly
high-flying waste issues have retreated. "When there's a
market correction, they tend to correct more than the
market," Mr. Greenberg said.
   So investors are balking at the $14-to-$17 range quoted in
the prospectus."If someone pinned me down, I'd say we'd buy
it at $10," said Nicholas Stephens, managing director of
research at Edgewood Management Co., New York, a
money-management firm.
   At $14 to $17 a share, however, "I heard people saying
it's just too pricey right now," added Mr. Stephens, who
along with other prospective investors attended an American
Waste presentation Tuesday in Manhattan. (Goldman Sachs
turned away reporters who sought to attend the meeting.)
   The jittery market has highlighted the risks that go along
with the possible rewards in new waste-management stocks.
After soaring to $40.25 a share in July, even Mid-American
shares have undergone a trashing. In part, that's because
Jacksonville, Fla., will negotiate first with industry leader
Waste Management Inc. over a planned disposal site coveted by
Mid-American. Yesterday, Mid-American shares rose 50 cents to
close at $20.25 a share in national over-the-counter trading.
   Joseph McNay, chairman of Essex Investment Management Co.
in Boston, said he is adamant about not buying American Waste
at $14 to $17 a share. Relative to more-experienced companies
in the business, such as Waste Management and
Browning-Ferris, "the filing price is out of range," he said.
While Waste Management is selling at about 15 times projected
earnings for 1991, American Waste is seeking a multiple of 20
times projected earnings. Moreover, the smaller company is
"unseasoned," Mr. McNay said.
   If the proposed offering doesn't fly at a high price, the
issue would be an unusual reversal for the management of
American Waste, as well as for the company itself.
   American Waste's founders -- led by the 42-year-old Mr.
Klingle and President Darrell D. Wilson, 39 -- have completed
a series of lucrative transactions. For example, along with
other investors, Mr. Klingle and Mr. Wilson acquired a small
trucking company for $57,600 in 1988, the prospectus says; a
year later they sold it to American Waste for $2.8 million.
And the company paid $4.4 million in executive bonuses last
year when net income was $5.3 million.
   Mr. Klingle declined to comment on those disclosures. But
the prospectus says the trucking-company transactions and
other insider deals were negotiated "at arm's length" with
the existing non-management shareholders. And the prospectus
suggests that the bonuses reflected the success of the
company.
   Though the disclosures in the prospectus raised some
eyebrows, several potential investors stressed that their
resistance to the offering is a matter of price.

   OTTAWA -- Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney named
eight additional government supporters to the Senate to try
to push through the government's proposed value-added tax.
   The move increased the size of the Senate to 112 seats
from 104 seats. It was the first time in Canadian history
that a prime minister has taken such action.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The highly unpopular tax bill has encountered stormy
resistance from the Liberal Party opposition in the appointed
chamber.
   The appointments give the ruling Progressive Conservatives
54 seats in the Senate. The Liberals have 52 seats. The
Conservatives will need the support of independent senators
to get the tax bill passed. The 7% tax is to take effect Jan.
1 if it is approved by the Senate.
   The appointments required the approval of Britain's
monarch who is Canada's titular head of state. Mr. Mulroney
said the queen authorized the appointments.
   Mr. Mulroney's action doesn't assure the passage of the
proposed value-added tax. The Liberal leadership in the
Senate said it will use various parliamentary tactics to
delay a vote on the tax.

   DETROIT -- Rising gasoline prices and fears of recession
may be taking a toll on what has been the hottest segment of
the auto market for the past five years: light trucks.
   General Motors Corp. said yesterday that it's temporarily
idling four factories or assembly lines that make pickup
trucks, sport-utility vehicles and chassis for recreational
and commercial vehicles because of slow sales. The company
didn't announce the shutting of any car-assembly plants.

   Ford Motor Co. said it is closing its Edison, N.J., plant
that assembles Ranger pickup trucks for one week, starting
Monday. But the company said the shutdown comes from
production considerations, not slow sales.
   Still, while domestic car sales have climbed about 1% so
far this month from a year earlier, sales of trucks dropped
8.2%. It's just the reverse of the dominant sales pattern of
recent years, as consumers have shifted from cars to minivans
and other trucks, many of which consume more gas than all but
the biggest cars.
   Many dealers say they have seen a slowdown in light-truck
business since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in early August sent
energy prices soaring. "Showroom traffic has dropped
considerably since oil prices went up," says Darrell McClure,
GMC trucks sales manager at Bill Farley Pontiac-GMC in
Birmingham, Ala.
   "You got to be a real true-blue truck buyer to buy one at
this point," says Dave Bacon, a sales manager for the Forest
Lake Ford and Chrysler dealerships in Minnesota. "Before we
were just selling them to people who liked the looks of the
trucks."
   Many analysts say it's too early to declare that soaring
gasoline prices are the main culprit. "Higher gas prices
certainly hurt new vehicles sales, but the overriding factor
is just the drop in consumer confidence in general," says
analyst John Casesa of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.
   Still, some dealers report strong sales for certain big
trucks. For example, Friendly Chevrolet in Dallas still is
selling plenty of its big Suburban passenger vans, says Steve
Fly, the dealership's retail truck manager.
   GM plans to idle the four truck operations for between a
week and four weeks. The longest shutdown is planned at the
Detroit plant that assembles chassis for recreational and
commercial vehicles. That plant closed last Monday and isn't
expected to reopen until Oct. 22. A GM plant in Ohio that
assembles compact pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles
also closed Monday and will reopen Oct. 8.
   In addition, GM plans to idle an assembly line in Flint,
Mich., that assembles chassis for crew cabs for one week,
starting Monday. And a second GM assembly line in Flint that
makes full-sized Jimmy models and Chevrolet Blazers is slated
to close for two weeks, starting Monday.
   Overall, the 10 major U.S. auto makers planned to build
137,288 cars this week, down 9.2% from 151,228 a year
earlier.
   Ford said it scheduled Saturday overtime at its Wayne,
Mich., car-assembly plant that builds the Escort and at its
Kansas City and St. Louis truck plants.
   GM said it scheduled Saturday overtime at its Bowling
Green, Ky., assembly plant that builds the Chevrolet
Corvette. In addition, GM said it will work overtime today at
its Janesville, Wis., plant that builds the Chevrolet
Cavalier.
   Chrysler Corp. said it is cutting its St. Louis 1 plant
down to a single shift for one week, instead of the normal
two shifts, because of slow sales for the Dodge Daytona and
Chrysler LeBaron.

   If the whale called Washington wriggles off the
sequestration hook, it will be a pity for at least one good
reason. Such an event would at least pierce the walls
Washington has erected around Castle Status Quo. We read, for
instance, that the federal air-traffic control system would
be the first "victim" of sequestration. Where are the holy
tablets on which it is written that air-traffic control must
be run by a publicly funded agency for all time?
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which operates
air-traffic control, has failed to keep up with the massive
growth in airline traffic. The FAA's $12 billion, 10-year
plan to modernize traffic control is six or seven years
behind schedule and billions over budget. The results are
frequent and increasing delays. Counting the value of
passengers' lost time, the Department of Transportation
estimates airline delays now cost the public some $5 billion
a year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The FAA is not completely to blame for the system's
systemic failures. It has been starved for money because of
its absurd funding structure. Revenues from the 8% user tax
on airline tickets are supposed to fund air-traffic control,
but most of the money is put into a mythical "trust fund"
that is often drained for spending on other programs.
Cumbersome procurement regulations mean that it takes an
airport four to seven years to acquire an upgraded radar
system. Federal civil-service laws lead to understaffing in
many areas and a rigid, worker-unfriendly management style.
   There is an alternative, favored even by many of the
air-traffic controllers themselves -- privatization. PATCO
proposed the idea in 1969, and the AFL-CIO's Lane Kirkland
has frequently endorsed it. Switzerland, Britain and New
Zealand have already turned air-traffic control over to
nonprofit, user-owned corporations. Bendix and Lockheed have
long provided traffic-control services to developing
countries.
   In 1988, Jim Burnley, Ronald Reagan's last Secretary of
Transportation, proposed creating a federally chartered
corporation that would handle air safety, much as Comsat now
handles satellite telecommunications. Various safeguards to
prevent strikes from shutting down the system were included.
   Mr. Burnley's successor, Sam Skinner, seems sometimes to
want to actively thwart privatization. He has been slow to
advocate the changes that would allow Albany, N.Y., and other
cities to sell their airports to private companies, along
with appropriate safeguards. His department's report on the
subject is said to endorse airport privatization rhetorically
but makes the specious argument that current law prevents the
government from allowing any airport privatizations.
   Whatever threat a sequester might have posed to the smooth
functioning of commercial aviation should convince President
Bush to take responsibility for the nation's airline policy
away from self-interested bureaucrats and place it where
someone can rethink it. A good suggestion would be Vice
President Quayle's Task Force on Competitiveness, once
chaired by George Bush. That task force on regulatory relief
accomplished much during its eight years. Look closely at
what any sequester would touch, and you'll see how much work
remains to be done on making this fat government more
efficient.

   Dole, Despite Budget-Cutter Image, Seeks
   Tax Break Aiding Company Tied to Him

   WASHINGTON -- Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole has
publicly paraded as a big deficit cutter, but privately has
been pressing for a half-billion-dollar-a-year tax break,
with the biggest benefit going to a single company with close
ties to him.
   According to people close to the talks, the Kansas
Republican has argued forcefully behind closed doors to
extend revenue-losing tax incentives that prop up the
fledgling ethanol-fuels industry. About 70% of the nation's
ethanol is produced by Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., a giant
commodities company based in Decatur, Ill. Ethanol, a
corn-distilled alcohol, is mixed with gasoline to make
gasohol.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's uncertain whether the tax credits will make it into
the budget package being negotiated by the White House and
Congress. But Sen. Dole's advocacy of them has drawn
criticism, even among members of his own party. Opponents
question their inclusion in a deficit-cutting plan, and note
that they aren't even scheduled to expire until the end of
1992. And though Sen. Dole says political contributions have
nothing to do with his support for the provisions, ADM and
its chairman, Dwayne Andreas, are longtime backers of his and
are big-time players in Washington in general.
   Over the years, Mr. Andreas, his relatives and ADM's
political action committee have contributed $81,000 to Sen.
Dole's political efforts. Since 1987, they've given more than
$300,000 to an array of Republican and Democratic members of
Congress. In 1988, Mr. Andreas gave $100,000 to Team 100, the
so-called soft money fund of George Bush's presidential
campaign that was exempt from federal election law limits.
   Personal ties also bind Sen. Dole with Mr. Andreas. In
1982, Mrs. Dole and her brother purchased an oceanfront
apartment in Bal Harbour, Fla., at a favorable price from the
ADM chairman. The Archer-Daniels-Midland Foundation also has
given $185,000 to the Dole Foundation, a charitable
organization set up by the senator.
   The tax credits, one for excise taxes and another for
income taxes, amount to a 60-cent subsidy on each gallon of
alcohol used for fuel. Although the credits go to companies
that mix ethanol with gasoline and not to ADM, they still
provide a boon to the company by creating a market for
ethanol.
   Sen. Dole and other backers of the ethanol breaks contend
that the hefty tax subsidies are essential for the survival
of the alcohol-fuels industry. They assert that ethanol
production is important because it provides a market for
U.S.-grown corn, which is in chronic oversupply, and helps
expand U.S.-produced motor fuels, which are chronically
scarce.
   For his part, Sen. Dole acknowledges that he spoke in
support of the credits' extension during recent budget talks
at Andrews Air Force Base. But he says his motives have been
misconstrued. "I'm getting tired of all this Andreas stuff,"
he complains. A Dole aide said the senator has even explored
giving more benefit to small, start-up ethanol companies, and
less to big companies such as ADM, though the plan hasn't
been completed.
   "This is an energy issue and Dole represents a lot of
farmers," a Dole spokesman says. "Why can't people understand
that?"
   A good number of people don't understand."It shouldn't be
in there," argues Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel, the senior
Republican on the House Budget Committee and a high-level
budget negotiator. "I assume it's in there because Bob Dole
wants it. He's always wanted tax breaks for ethanol."
   "It is not worthwhile in the context of deficit
reduction," he adds. "We have probably oversubsidized that
industry, particularly since that industry is largely one
company."
   The Sierra Club questions whether the credits are
necessary, especially given the recent jump in energy prices.
And a renegade farmers' lobby called the American Corn
Growers Association denounces Sen. Dole's maneuvers. "The man
has no shame," says the corn group's chief lobbyist, John
Ford. "He's a go-fer for Dwayne Andreas."
   A spokesman for ADM says the company isn't lobbying for
extension of the credits, and that there isn't anything
unusual -- or untoward -- about its support of Sen. Dole.
   The current round of budget talks is only the latest
opportunity Sen. Dole has taken to try to extend the credits.
Over the past year or so, the senator has delayed at least
two trade bills trying to gain leverage for the extensions.
   The next move depends on the outcome of the budget summit.
Sen. Thomas Daschle (D., S.D.), for example, also is eager to
extend the credits, but would phase them out eventually.
"I've been waiting," he says, "to see what success Sen. Dole
has."

   Pier 1 Shelves 18 New Stores

   The day after Iraq invaded Kuwait, Clark Johnson, chairman
of the fast-growing Pier 1 Imports retail chain, noticed a
marked drop-off in his stores' business. One week later, when
President Bush ordered troops to the Persian Gulf, store
traffic tumbled again.
   As a result, yellow lights are blinking at the successful
Fort Worth, Texas, retailer of furniture and home
furnishings, and 18 of the 84 new stores it had planned to
open in coming months have been put on hold. "I am much less
sanguine about our prospects than earlier this year," says
Mr. Johnson.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis contributed to a change in plans
at Heritage Communications of Des Moines, Iowa. The company
is trying to buy six radio and TV stations but recently cut
back its planned offering price by 20%. "We aren't willing to
stretch as we might have been a few months ago," says
Heritage Chairman James Hoak.
   National Graphics Co. of Atlanta has also gone into a
state of suspended animation. The company needs a new
printing press but has delayed the purchase "until the
economy has some better predictability to it," says Tim
Combs, the chief executive.
   The three companies illustrate one of the most troublesome
economic casualties of the Iraqi crisis. Economists have been
cranking up models that show how the spike in oil prices will
affect utilities, trucking companies, chemical companies and
others that directly depend on petroleum. But prospects of
Mideast mayhem have also dealt a psychological blow to
thousands of businesses that don't depend heavily on oil.
   U.S. business, in short, has a bad case of Iraqnophobia.
   "This makes what was already an uncertain business
environment even more uncertain," says Eastman Kodak Co.
Chairman Kay Whitmore. "It heaps uncertainty on top of
uncertainty." And businessmen hate uncertainty.
   In better economic times, the problems in the Persian Gulf
might have been less of a jolt to business confidence. But
they follow a litany of economic ills: the breakdown of the
savings and loan industry, a sharp downturn in regional
real-estate markets, bankruptcy and consolidation in the
retail industry, federal budgetary gridlock, rising problems
in the banking industry and a growing credit squeeze.
   For many business people, skyrocketing oil prices and the
possibility of war are too much. "I think everybody said
that's the last straw," says Thomas Darden, chief executive
of the Cherokee Sanford Group, a North Carolina brick maker.
"Most people wouldn't conceive of taking a risk in this
environment."
   To be sure, the businesses most affected are still those
directly connected to oil. The airline industry, for
instance, has been thrown into confusion because fuel is such
a huge portion of airlines' costs. Rising oil prices also are
starting to ooze into other parts of the economy, as
manufacturers of chemicals, plastics, and other products made
of petroleum try to raise prices.
   "There are a lot of legitimate price increases on resins
and chemicals," says Carroll Britt, director of purchasing
for Hatteras Yachts in North Carolina, "and then there are a
lot of people using the Middle East as an excuse to put
prices through that have no relation to oil."
   But the economic impact is by no means limited to those
direct effects. Polls show that public attitudes changed
sharply after the Iraqi invasion Aug. 2, with fears of
recession soaring. Confidence is clearly declining among
consumers and business people.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management, for
instance, found "a wait-and-see attitude" in its September
survey, says Robert Bretz, chairman of the group's business
survey committee.
   The wariness, though most evident in manufacturing, is
present in all sectors. "I don't care whether you are in
manufacturing, retailing, restaurants or services, you are
feeling the effect of uncertainty," says Thomas Skala,
president of Fleet National Bank in Providence, R.I.
   The result could be a sharp decline in planned capital
outlays for the coming months. The latest Commerce Department
survey of business spending plans, conducted in July, before
the Iraqi invasion, showed U.S. companies expected a modest
5.4% increase in business spending next year. That was down
substantially from the first of the year, and the Iraq crisis
is nearly certain to pull it down further.
   Some companies have already announced changes in spending
plans. Marriott Corp. this week said it is putting on hold
most of its plans to build hotels next year. Champion
International has said it will defer a new pulp mill in
Brazil and the conversion of a paper mill in the U.S.
   "With the likelihood of a softer economy ahead, this was a
logical place to defer," says Champion's chairman, Andrew
Sigler.
   Consultants are watching clients hunker down. "I've been
making calls to industrial clients, and they are seeing
either hesitation among their customers, or they are
themselves cutting back," says Gary Shilling, an economic
consultant in New York. "Some are really in the bomb
shelters, pulling the metal doors down."
   Advertising spending, one of the first areas to feel the
effects of changing business sentiment, is also taking a
blow. "People are more concerned about the economic outlook,"
says Richard Winger, a partner at Boston Consulting Group and
an advertising specialist. "Advertising expenses are one of
the really easy things for businesses to cut." Mr. Winger
speculates that the actual onset of a recession might help
the advertising business, by ending the current uncertainty.
"Everyone is very cautious because we don't know what's going
to happen," he says. "As soon as you say the recession's
here, people may breathe a sigh of relief."
   The prospect of less advertising spending has caused
Heritage Communications to cut its offering price for new
radio and TV stations. Mr. Hoak says the company's
advertisers are no longer willing to commit to buying time in
advance. "People are making decisions at the last possible
moment," he says, "and some are trying to cancel previous
commitments."
   The result: "You have to live more hand-to-mouth,
day-to-day," he says. "You can't plan your business out."
   National Graphics illustrates that new, day-to-day
business existence. A small commercial printing company with
about $6 million in sales, the Atlanta company had decided
last year to buy a new press for $750,000 to $1 million. But
Mr. Combs, the chief executive, fears customers hit by higher
oil prices may cut back their orders. "We just don't think we
have enough confidence in the next six months" to invest in
the new press, he says.
   With the Mideast conflict casting so many unknowns across
the economy, business people are finding it difficult even to
formulate budgets. "We are trying to do our budget for 1991,"
says Mr. Britt of Hatteras Yachts, "but it is very tough."
   Some business people say questions about government policy
compound the confusion caused by the Mideast crisis. With oil
prices rising and the economy slumping, they say it is
unclear whether the Federal Reserve's next move on interest
rates will be up or down.
   "In my opinion, the single most important uncertainty is
Federal Reserve policy," says Walter Joelson, chief economist
at General Electric Co. "It's unclear whether the Fed is
going to conduct an anti-inflation policy, or respond with a
fairly liberal policy to preserve the integrity of the
banking system. That makes an enormous difference."
   The continued grappling over the federal budget deficit
has also worsened the problem. "I've never known a time when
the obvious question of how to manage the economy was so
clear, and yet we aren't doing anything about it," complains
Kodak Chairman Whitmore. "I'm sure a lot of the capital
markets of the world are looking to the budget negotiations."
If a credible budget agreement is reached, he predicts,
interest rates would probably drop and business confidence be
bolstered.
   The combination of budget and Middle East worries is
causing double trouble for Versar Inc., an environmental
risk-management firm in Springfield, Va. With environmental
concerns on the rise, it had expected 1990 to be a "banner
year."
   But Versar depends heavily on business with the federal
government. And Michael Markels, Versar's president, fears
the Persian Gulf crisis could cause the Pentagon to cut back
work in the environmental area to pay for operations in the
Mideast.
   Even companies staying the course wonder how long the
Mideast conflict will permit them to continue doing so. "We
see no effects that I'm aware of at the moment, but we feel
quite certain there are going to be some in the near future,"
says Philip Rollhaus, chief executive of Chicago-based
Quixote Corp., the parent of a group of high-tech companies.
"We're not quite sure in what shape or form they are going to
arrive, but we certainly are wondering and expecting."

   LONDON -- London's stock market has taken its share of
battering from the Persian Gulf crisis, but some big British
investors are keeping a stiff upper lip. Several money
managers and analysts expect that, although the market still
faces rocky times, a recovery is only a few months away.
   Betting that any fighting in the Gulf will be over quickly
and that oil prices will drop, some institutions are buying
blue chips they consider undervalued.

   "There's general belief that there will be war in the
Gulf," says Alistair McLennan, senior fund manager at Norwich
Insurance Group. "There then would be a {downward} reaction
in Wall Street and a knee-jerk reaction here. But if it's
over quickly, that could lead to a very, very sharp upward
movement -- greater than 20% before the end of January."
   Mr. McLennan says that Norwich remains fully invested, and
recently has been buying certain internationally oriented
stocks. They are shares that, he reasons, should rise if oil
prices decline and sterling, currently propped up by
Britain's oil-producing capacity, starts to weaken. (A weaker
pound makes British exports cheaper.)
   The stocks include Grand Metropolitan, BTR, B.A.T
Industries and Imperial Chemical Industries. Norwich also has
been buying defense-oriented stocks, including General
Electric, which isn't related to the U.S. company, and GKN.
"The peace dividend has been omitted," quips Mr. McLennan.
   At Edinburgh-based Standard Life Assurance Co., "we
haven't exactly been filling our boots, but we're still
supportive of U.K. equities," says John K. Thomson, senior
investment manager. Britain's largest mutual insurer is still
buying stocks at its pre-Gulf clip of #14 million ($26.2
million) a week, he says.
   Adds Mr. Thomson: "Short-term, the Gulf, inflation and
worries about a recession make for a nervous market. But
long-term, the market looks cheap. Once people are convinced
that Saudi oil is secure, the market will recover. When the
market turns, you won't be able to get any money in at all."
   Mick Brewis, who manages money at Baillie Gifford &amp; Co.,
says the Edinburgh fund manager's cash position is double its
usual level, mainly because of U.S. share sales. He thinks
the U.K. market "is oversold" and he has been picking up
shares of Racal Telecom, the cellular-phone maker.
   Says Mr. Brewis: "Racal is pretty cheap at the moment. A
lot of Americans have been selling the stock, but we think
its medium-term prospects are pretty good. Its product
definitely is a productivity tool -- there will be a need for
it."
   With the British economy staggering under high inflation,
high interest rates and low growth, shares already were
sliding when Saddam Hussein blind sided world financial
markets with the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. The general view
before the crisis was that the market would turn around by
year end. The crisis has accelerated the decline and, say
many market pros, has delayed the recovery until the first
quarter of 1991, although there are some sanguine souls who
still think the snapback will come right on schedule.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index was in the
low 2300s just prior to the Iraqi invasion. Many in the
London market had expected the index to fall to about 2200 by
year end purely as a result of Britain's economic woes. Then
the Gulf crisis hammered shares by hyping U.K. inflation to
10.6% just when many thought the rate would peak. The FT-SE
100 closed at 2009.1, up 9.1 points yesterday. The Financial
Times 30 Share Index gained 15.5 points to 1548.1. Volume was
428.8 million shares, up from 410.3 million shares Wednesday.
   Midsummer predictions for a year-end market turnaround
were based on the belief that Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government would begin to loosen Britain's
stifling 15% base interest rate when inflation showed signs
of receding.
   Money managers and analysts also thought that a rate cut
would be coupled with British entry into the European
Monetary System's exchange-rate mechanism, or ERM. Membership
would tie sterling to a narrow band with other European
currencies and act as a stabilizing force against inflation.
   But Mrs. Thatcher this week strongly stated that Britons
shouldn't expect a rate cut soon. Still, the London market
has been buoyed in recent days by indications that Britain
may join the ERM soon, without a rate cut.
   "You could see a 15% to 20% rise in the market on the back
of ERM entry," says Mike Young, director of European
investment strategy at Merrill Lynch. Until then, he adds,
"things remain fairly gloomy -- we're in a period of very
slow economic growth, disappointing corporate earnings, a
housing market that's in a state of collapse and where the
cost of financing inventories is enormous."
   In the current environment, it's best to be defensive,
says Richard Kersley, U.K. equity strategist at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd. He recommends purchase of food retailer Tesco,
pharmaceuticals maker Wellcome, and Reckitt &amp; Colman, which
is in both fields. He also favors BTR "because of its proven
record" and General Electric, which he says has "a strong
balance sheet and prudent management."
   The wild card, of course, is the Gulf. A prolonged war
with damage to Saudi oil production facilities would raise
havoc with world stock markets and economies. "We could have
a 15% inflation rate in a year {in Britain} if oil prices
really got out of hand," says Mike Payne, senior investment
strategist at Legal &amp; General Group, a major insurer.
   Observes Standard Life's Mr. Thomson: "You need to be a
military strategist as well as a market strategist to try to
judge this market."
   Elsewhere, shares yesterday ended higher in Paris, Zurich,
Helsinki, Milan, Madrid; lower in Frankfurt, Stockholm, Oslo;
and mixed in Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed
higher.
   And stocks closed higher in Taipei and Sydney, mixed in
Seoul, Singapore and Hong Kong, and lower in Manila and

   Mexico Concerned Over Canadian Role
   In Talks With U.S. on Free-Trade Pact

   WASHINGTON -- Mexico has voiced concerns about Canada's
bid to participate in Mexico's negotiations with the U.S.
over a free-trade agreement.
   In a classified letter to President Bush, White House
Trade Representative Carla Hills said Mexico is worried that
Canadian participation "could delay a U.S.-Mexico free-trade
agreement or jeopardize consideration by the U.S. Congress."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Canada, whose own free-trade pact with the U.S. took
effect last year, maintains that excluding it from the
U.S.-Mexico negotiations wouldn't be "politically
acceptable," according to Mrs. Hills. But, she added, the
Canadians don't want to be "a spoiler and would bow out
diplomatically" if their participation is seen "as delaying
or jeopardizing the achievement of a U.S.Mexican free-trade
agreement."
   Mrs. Hills, the nation's top trade negotiator, sent the
letter Sept. 21, after meeting the previous evening with
Mexican Commerce Minister Jaime Serra Puche and Canadian
Trade Minister John Crosbie.
   Canadian involvement undoubtedly would complicate
U.S.-Mexico talks. "Two's company, three may be a crowd,"
said Jim Moore, a former assistant secretary at the Commerce
Department during the Reagan administration. "To be able to
bring a third party -- Canada -- into the middle of these
U.S.-Mexican negotiations makes a much more delicate
situation." Mr. Moore, now a private consultant, added that
"there are many enormous complex bilateral issues" between
the U.S. and Mexico that don't closely involve Canada.
   The U.S. push for a Mexican free-trade pact is part of the
Bush administration's strategy to boost commerce in the
Western hemisphere. In addition to the proposed agreement
with Mexico, President Bush called this summer for Latin
American nations to work toward establishing a free-trade
area throughout the Western hemisphere.
   Already, Chile, which has done much to liberalize its
economy and trade over the past eight years, is eager to
start negotiating a bilateral trade pact with the U.S. Mrs.
Hills's aides say they welcome Chile's enthusiasm, but they
warn that the process takes time.
   Mrs. Hills said in her letter that she and her Canadian
and Mexican counterparts will hold informal talks in the
coming months to devise a structure for the U.S.-Mexico
free-trade talks. She said the three trade ministers set next
Jan. 31 as "an unannounced deadline for determining whether
the negotiations would proceed bilaterally or trilaterally."
Formal negotiations between the U.S. and Mexico on the trade
pact are unlikely to start before that date.
   Mr. Bush notified Congress earlier this week of his plans
to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico. Mrs. Hills
suggested in her letter to the president that the
administration encourage the three nations to consult in the
coming months "to see if the trilateral approach was workable
and satisfactory for all sides, with the understanding that
Canada would depart gracefully" if its participation seemed
likely to upset the negotiating schedule or jeopardize
congressional approval.
   The president sought to ease Canadian concerns in his
letter notifying Congress of his intentions to negotiate with
Mexico. He said the U.S. would consult with both Canada and
Mexico during the U.S.-Mexico negotiations, with a view to
eventually achieving a three-way agreement on free trade.

   STOCKHOLM -- Big banks and market regulators are
scrambling to head off a crisis that has crippled Sweden's
high-flying commercial paper market and called into question
the survival of several big finance companies.
   The trouble started Monday, when sour property loans
forced Nyckeln Holding AB, one of Sweden's biggest finance
companies, to slash its full-year profit forecast. The news
sent shares of Nyckeln and its parent Beijer Capital AB into
a free fall on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Even worse, as investors shunned its commercial paper in
Stockholm markets Nyckeln sank into a liquidity squeeze.
Problems swiftly spread to other finance companies, which
like Nyckeln had been big dispensers of real estate credits.
   By yesterday morning, when the Gamlestaden AB unit of
Nobel Industries AB announced it no longer could meet payment
obligations because of acute liquidity woes, the exchange had
halted trading in six companies' shares.
   Trading reached a virtual standstill in commercial paper
issued by about 30 Swedish finance companies. The companies
rely heavily on those corporate IOU's with maturities of as
much as six months for the bulk of their normal financing
needs. Alarmed regulatory authorities huddled with big
Stockholm banks, trying to arrange emergency financing and
avert bankruptcies.

   H-2 Fire Is Latest
   Setback for Japan's
   Space Program

   TOKYO -- Japan's space program, like its U.S. counterpart,
is struggling with a series of embarrassing setbacks.
   The National Space Development Agency said Thursday that
the engine for its H-2 rocket, the centerpiece of Japan's
space effort for the 1990s, caught fire Wednesday during
tests at the Tanegashima Space Center off the southern tip of
Japan. It was the fourth test fire in the past year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman said the agency was discussing whether to
delay yet again the first voyage of the H-2, which is slated
for early 1993. That date was set last year after previous
glitches forced a one-year lapse from the original target
date of early 1992. The rocket is also already running 10%
over its original 200 billion yen ($1.46 billion) budget.
   Japan's space program lags years behind those of other
industrialized nations, and the H-2 is its first 100%
domestically made rocket. The H-2 is also supposed to launch
a variety of other Japanese space projects, such as
satellites and an unmanned space shuttle.
   Delays in the H-2 could force the embarrassing choice of
either pushing those projects back further or seeking foreign
assistance. Analysts have said Japan is also hoping the H-2
ultimately will compete with organizations like Europe's
Arianespace for commercial launches.
   Japanese engine makers, led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
Ltd., are struggling in part because this is their first
attempt to build an engine for the first stage of a rocket,
which is the heaviest phase and carries the most fuel.
   This is also their first cryogenic engine, a complex
technology that runs on liquid hydrogen. It has more power
for its size and runs at higher temperatures than traditional
engines fueled by petroleum.
   The previous major test problems were the result of
difficulties with the turbine blade, which cracked, or with
the starting mechanism, the spokesman said. He added that
those problems had been solved.
   But the fire this week, which started in the engine's
turbo pump, apparently had a different cause, the spokesman
said, and the agency is conducting tests.
   Last Saturday, the engine had its most successful test so
far, running for 200 seconds. The space agency was aiming for
350 seconds on Wednesday. But 16 seconds after ignition, the
fire started, damaging the engine and the test facility
before it was put out more than 15 minutes later.

   OTTAWA -- Canada's National Energy Board conditionally
approved electricity exports valued at 24 billion Canadian
dollars (US$20.8 billion) by Hydro-Quebec to Vermont and New
York over the next 30 years.
   The board said the exports will be subject to an
environmental review by the federal government of two big
hydroelectric dams, planned by Hydro-Quebec partly to meet
the export requirements.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dams are to be built in the James Bay and Hudson Bay
areas of northern Quebec.
   Hydro-Quebec proposed to export 450,000 kilowatts of
electricity to Vermont Joint Owners, a group of nine
utilities in Vermont, over a 30-year period starting Nov. 1.
The provincial government-owned utility also proposed to
export to New York Power Authority one million kilowatts of
electricity from May 1, 1995, to April 30, 2016.
   Jacques Guevremont, a Hydro-Quebec vice president, said
the board's conditions are acceptable and shouldn't be an
obstacle to the exports.
   Several native and environmental groups have opposed the
construction of the dams, because they claim the facilities
will pollute the air and water and destroy the hunting
grounds of the Cree Indians living in the area.
   Hydro-Quebec's electricity exports totaled about C$190
million last year.

   Sotheby's Near
   Agreement to Sell
   Ford Estate Art

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Sotheby's Inc. is negotiating with the estate
of Henry Ford II to auction art works valued at an estimated
$50 million to $70 million from the late auto magnate's
collection.
   The New York-based auction unit of Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
beat out Christie's International PLC of London in a bidding
war for the right to sell the prestigious collection,
according to people in the art world and an internal memo
circulated by Christie's.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Christie's memo said that the firm had lost the collection
purely on financial grounds and that matching or out-bidding
Sotheby's offer to guarantee a minimum sale price for the
collection would have "put the company at risk." Christopher
Burge, president of the Christie's USA unit, said the art
works are "jolly nice paintings," but "our rivals were
prepared to offer a higher guarantee in this uncertain
market."
   Sotheby's declined to comment on the sale. Frank Chopin,
attorney for Kathleen DuRoss Ford, widow of Mr. Ford, said
"some part of his collection will, in fact, be sold, probably
in November and probably at Sotheby's."
   The collection includes works by Paul Cezanne, Amedeo
Modigliani and Pierre Auguste Renoir that haven't been on the
market in over 30 years.
   The Ford works would be the first major single-owner art
collection to come on the market this fall in a sales season
for which the auction houses have been trying to lower public
expectations. (Sotheby's upcoming sale of the Greta Garbo
estate, though a big name collection, features mostly
midrange paintings and furniture.)
   Both Sotheby's and Christie's have said they are trimming
the size of the auctions in an attempt to rein in the
substantial percentage of unsold works that marked some of
last spring's auctions in New York and London. The high
unsold, or buy-in, rates at some of those auctions raised
doubts about the strength of the art market.
   The prestigious Ford name, plus the fact that most of the
estate's paintings are fresh to the market, made this
collection extremely desirable to both houses, sources said.
   The $50 million to $70 million that the collection is
expected to fetch would nearly double the $80 million
Sotheby's had earlier estimated its major fall Impressionist
auction would take in. At last spring's Impressionist
auction, the firm took in $286 million, an amount that was
boosted by the $78.1 million paid by a Japanese collector for
a Renoir similar to one hanging in the Musee d'Orsay in
Paris.
   Sotheby's is expected to announce next week that a special
sale of the Ford collection will be held on Monday, Nov. 13.
The sale would kick off the fall Impressionist sale week that
brings the major auction houses a substantial chunk of their
annual revenue.
   In an eleventh-hour race for the right to sell the
collection, Sotheby's and Christie's were given only days to
estimate prices on all the works, many of which are in
Detroit, and prepare their bids and financial statements,
people familiar with the bidding said. Any delay would have
postponed the sale until the December auctions in London.
   Competition between Sotheby's and Christie's was
particularly keen because both houses have close ties to the
Ford family. Henry Ford II was formerly vice chairman of
Sotheby's, and his widow, Kathleen, is a friend of Judy
Taubman, wife of Sotheby's chairman A. Alfred Taubman. Mr.
Ford had also previously sold art at Christie's, and his
first wife, Anne Ford Johnson, works in international
relations at Christie's.
   While negotiations aren't final, the arrangement being
worked out would essentially be an underwriting of the
collection, with Sotheby's putting its own capital at risk,
people close to the negotiations said. They said Ford heirs
would be guaranteed a total take -- even if buyers don't bid
that high -- plus a percentage of any proceeds above that
total.
   Through a guarantee arrangement, an auction house,
normally an impartial go-between, accepts some of the
downside risk of an auction. An auction house normally sets
the guarantee at about 80% of the lower estimated price for
the work in order to protect itself. But people familiar with
the bidding between Sotheby's and Christie's said competition
was so keen that Sotheby's proposed guarantee was even more
aggressive than the 80%.
   Henry Ford II died in 1987, and a feud over his $350
million estate quickly ensued. The primary heir to the Ford
trust, Kathleen DuRoss Ford, is a former model who married
Mr. Ford in 1980. Upon her death, the trust flows to Mr.
Ford's six grandchildren. Since Mr. Ford's death, the Ford
heirs have repeatedly gone to court over issues of
trusteeship.

   This weekend, the United Nations will convene one of its
most highly publicized gatherings in years: The World Summit
for Children. Largely organized by Unicef, one of the U.N.'s
more respected agencies, the meeting now promises to be
attended by as many as 70 heads of state or government,
including President Bush.
   According to its sponsors, "the Summit will focus upon
universal problems affecting children." The U.S. has reviewed
and indicated its approval of one item on the agenda -- a
proposed Convention on the Rights of the Child. Were other
aspects of the conference's agenda as carefully examined,
however, it is by no means clear they would meet with the
approval of the president, or of the American public.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The conference's main background report is Unicef's "The
World Summit for Children," an updated adaptation of its
"State of the World's Children 1990." The report does indeed
contain proposals for a number of worthy initiatives --
diffusion of low-cost technologies for reducing child
mortality, for example. Yet much, if not most, of the
report's argumentation is given over to a rather different
purpose -- to making the case that Western creditors should
forgive the international debts owed by Third World
governments in the name of the world's children.
   Ever since the advent of the "Third World debt crisis" in
the early 1980s, Unicef says, the transfer of resources from
poor countries to rich ones has caused hardship in many areas
of the world. To protect their credit standing and meet their
international debt-service payments, it argues, the
governments of many low-income countries have undertaken
harsh adjustment policies. These have routinely included
cutbacks in social services upon which the vulnerable depend.
As a result, it concludes, "the poorest and most vulnerable
children have paid the third world's debt with their health .
. . {and} with the loss of their opportunity to be educated."
   "Infant mortality," it says, "is known to have risen in
parts of Latin America and Africa," and "the proportion of
children enrolled {in school} began to fall" for developing
regions as a whole. Thus, "the sine qua non of a resumption
of human progress" is said to be "some significant reduction
in debt servicing" -- preferably through "writing off of most
of the remaining debts of Africa . . . {and} further
reductions in the commercial debts of Latin America."
   This is not the first time that Unicef has suggested that
creditors in affluent Western countries were killing babies
by insisting upon debt repayments. In 1988, for instance, its
annual report announced that 500,000 children in low-income
countries had died in the previous year due to conditions
associated with the debt crisis. Yet each major component of
Unicef's argument is either debatable or demonstrably
inaccurate. Taken together, they constitute a serious
misdiagnosis of the problems facing children and other
vulnerable groups in most of the world.
   The notion that the "Third World" is being drained of
resources by rich countries is not a new one. To document its
assertions, however, Unicef relies upon a specific set of
numbers produced by the World Bank. Those data indicate that
poor countries, on balance, have been transferring resources
to rich ones since 1982, and that the magnitude of the net
transfer approached $40 billion a year in the late 1980s. Yet
even the World Bank has discarded those estimates as
unreliable. In response to criticism from the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Bank
itself now uses a substantially revised set of figures.
   The OECD's estimates, incidentally, indicate that the net
transfer of resources to developing countries as a whole has
remained strongly positive during the years of the debt
crisis, albeit at a lower absolute level than in the years
leading up to it. Between 1983 and 1987, for example, the
OECD estimates that the developing countries enjoyed a net
transfer from abroad of more than $130 billion (not adjusted
for inflation or exchange-rate fluctuations). The "least
developed" countries -- a group including much of sub-Saharan
Africa -- are estimated to have received a net (unadjusted)
transfer from the West and its funding agencies of more than
$50 billion during that period alone.
   Unicef's claims about the adjustment policies of highly
indebted governments are scarcely more convincing. The most
comprehensive and reliable figures on public finance in the
Third World are those of the International Monetary Fund,
which serves as a creditor to many of these governments.
According to its data and estimates, central government
expenditures accounted for a greater fraction of national
output in developing countries in 1987 (the most recent year
available) than in 1982 -- the year the debt crisis broke.
   The same is true of central government expenditures net of
lending and repayments -- in other words, after the impact of
the debt crisis is specifically taken into account. Even in
Africa and Latin America, government spending, adjusted for
lending and repayments, appears to account for a greater
share of gross domestic product today than before the debt
crisis. Only against an expectation of even more rapid
government growth could current spending be characterized as
generally austere.
   What about the charges that infant mortality rates are
rising, and educational enrollment rates are dropping, in
regions of the Third World? In its report for the summit,
Unicef does not attempt to explain how it would document its
infant mortality assertions. It is difficult, in fact, to
imagine how anyone would do so.
   To measure year-to-year changes in infant mortality rates,
one would need reasonably complete figures on births and
infant deaths. According to the U.N. Population Division,
there are today only 14 countries or territories in the
developing regions with populations of a million or more and
infant mortality registration 90% or more complete. By the
U.N.'s reckoning, these places account for less than 3% of
the developing world's population. None is in sub-Saharan
Africa.
   That these places publish annual figures on infant
mortality, of course, makes them atypical. For what it is
worth, however, two of them -- Chile and Uruguay -- have been
through rescheduling of their government debt. Debt crisis
notwithstanding, infant mortality in Uruguay was more than
35% lower in 1987 than in 1980; in Chile, more than 40%
lower.
   Unicef's postulated drop in Third World school enrollment
is equally elusive. Unesco's data are considered to be
authoritative on this topic. According to Unesco's most
recent figures, net enrollment ratios for developing
countries as a group have risen steadily throughout the
1980s, and are higher than ever before.
   At first exposure, Unicef's intricate and energetic
attempt to equate Third World debt to the distress of
children may seem rather peculiar. But, reduced to its
basics, the viewpoint bears distinct resemblance to earlier
calls for the "New International Economic Order." Those
proposals, in vogue in the 1970s at the U.N. and elsewhere,
envisioned massive and unconditional transfers from taxpayers
in the West to governments in the Third World.
   The World Summit for Children, it appears, will
reintroduce this rhetoric and reasoning to respectable
audiences in a new and improved format. No longer will the
appeal for vast transfers be couched in terms of the desire
of Third World rulers to assume their rightful place at the
international table. It will be cast in terms of helpless,
powerless and manifestly innocent victims in those same
countries.
   It is ironic that Unicef and others should be making the
case for the New International Economic Order into a
children's issue. In its original variant, the essence of the
proposal was unaccountability. In the ambitious new world to
come, Third World governments would be unanswerable to their
Western benefactors -- and to the populations they themselves
rule.
   There is a connection between the debt crisis and the
plight of children. The very states that request, and
require, large-scale and continuous concessional transfers
from abroad to sustain them seem, during times of financial
difficulty, to be among those least averse to exposing
children and other vulnerable groups under their authority.
That, however, is one threat to children that summiteers are
unlikely to hear about at their weekend conference.

   Some People Want
   To Pay More Taxes

   Funds From Innovative Plan
   Would Be Used to Make
   Downtown Cleaner, Safer

   PHILADELPHIA -- Believe it or not, some merchants and
restaurant owners here actually want to pay higher property
taxes.
   Their motives are selfish: They want to appoint themselves
tax collectors and see that the extra money gets spent
strictly to help their own businesses, by making their
streets cleaner and safer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These property owners, whose shops, cafes and restaurants
are sprinkled throughout an 80-block downtown area, say they
are fed up with inadequate city services. They're also
frustrated by vagrants, vandals and armed robbers, and afraid
of losing more business to the suburbs. So they propose
increasing their property taxes by 4.5%, creating about $6.2
million a year in supplemental funds for security and
sanitation services.
   A bookstore operator tells of the time police took 45
minutes to respond to an armed robbery. A clothing-store
owner describes winos who stare while customers try on suits.
Sam Talucci, who owns the Magnolia Cafe, complains of bricks
thrown through his front window and vagrants sleeping on the
sidewalk.
   Business at the Magnolia is down 10% to 15% from last
year, Mr. Talucci says. He's willing to pay more in taxes if
it will help bring customers back. "Why should customers want
to put themselves through Dante's Inferno?" he asks.
   David Mink, an owner of the Sansom Street Oyster House,
doesn't object to the extra $500 a year the new plan would
cost him. "The city administration has lost control of the
streets," Mr. Mink says. "The perception is not healthy from
outside the city, and the perception is the reality."
   Hundreds of municipal governments around the country have
allowed and even encouraged the formation of
business-improvement districts as a means to pay for big
capital improvements. More recently, these special-services
districts have started to address issues of safety and
sanitation management.
   New York City has about 20 business-improvement districts,
the largest being Grand Central Partnership. The Downtown
Seattle Association has been sweeping streets since 1985. In
Oregon, the Association for Portland Progress charges the
city for services it provides. Similar programs are under way
in such cities as Dallas, Houston and Washington, D.C.
   In Philadelphia, the need is especially urgent. The city
government faces a fiscal crisis and says it expects to run
out of operating funds by Dec. 1. Deep cuts in many city
services, including police and sanitation, may soon be
unavoidable.
   But the plan for Philadelphia's business-improvement
district hatched long before the fiscal crisis flared. A
private, not-for-profit group, Central Philadelphia
Development Corp., came up with the idea in 1985. The concept
picked up momentum last fall when the group recruited Ronald
Rubin, a prominent downtown developer, to become a spokesman
and rally support for the district in the business community.
   (Mr. Rubin has 13 properties in the district, including
two that are tax-abated. He has promised to pay the full tax
on both abated properties, about $100,000 extra.)
   In March, Philadelphia's City Council voted to allow Mr.
Rubin's group of self-appointed board members to form a
quasi-governmental, private authority, called the Special
Services District. They crafted a plan and a budget for the
district. Then, at a public hearing in August, the group
presented its ideas and solicited comment from affected
property owners.
   Philadelphia's special-services district would be the
nation's largest in area covered. The police already
allocated to the zone would be redeployed through a new,
centrally located facility. The district would hire 40
"community service representatives" equipped with two-way
radios linked to the police hub. These people would serve as
extra security and a source for tourist information. The
district also plans to hire 115 laborers to sweep and wash
the sidewalks.
   But many downtown residents aren't interested in sharing
the cost of improving business conditions. At hearings, they
complained that they had no way to pass on the higher
charges, unlike merchants and building owners.
   To avoid jeopardizing passage of its plan, the district
developed a special account, funded by voluntary
contributions from tax-exempt properties, such as hospitals,
universities, religious institutions and tax-abated real
estate. Owner-occupants can opt to charge their assessed tax
to the special account. The district says it already has
several promised donations.
   "We get all the benefits and we don't have to pay
anything" extra, said Samuel Berlin, president of Kennedy
House, where 75% of the residents are retired or on a fixed
income.
   The city council will probably vote on the measure by the
end of October, and the authority hopes to start collecting
the new tax by the end of the year. Billing and collecting
will be left to the authority; no money will pass through
city coffers. But the city has offered its enforcement
resources to the private tax collectors. In the event of
delinquencies, the city would file liens and judgments
against properties that are one year behind in payment.
   Councilman John F. Street represents most of the people
who live in the proposed district, and he still has some
doubts about the plan. Since the authority is to be an
extension of the municipal government, he questions why the
authority has budgeted a $75,000 salary for the district
administrator. Notes Mr. Street: "The mayor makes only
$70,000."

   WASHINGTON -- The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission
charging that its GOP rival is violating federal contribution
limits in Senate races through a fund-raising program called
the Inner Circle.
   Set up earlier this year as a separate fund-raising
committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is
using the Inner Circle to funnel $11 million to its Senate
candidates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Federal law places limits on the contributions that party
committees can make to candidates. Each can contribute
$17,500 directly to candidates and make certain additional
expenditures on their behalf. Because the Inner Circle is set
up independently from the Republican committee, the
Republicans contend that those contributions to candidates
don't fall under these limits. In its complaint, the
Democratic committee says they should. Robert Bauer, general
counsel to the Democratic committee, says the Republican
committee is "trying to buy Senate seats."
   In a news release, the GOP defended the Inner Circle
program as legal and ethical.
   Earlier this year, a federal judge here ruled that the
Republican committee had illegally circumvented spending
limits by routing $2.7 million to its Senate candidates in
1986.

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. counterterrorism and intelligence
experts are combing the details of a break-in at the Brussels
home of an American general to see if it was a terrorist
attack connected in any way with Iraq.
   The incident, believed to have been an attempt at murder
or kidnapping, was aimed at Gen. John Douglass, who works on
the military committee at North Atlantic Treaty Organization
headquarters. Gen. Douglass wasn't home, so the attack
failed. No group has publicly claimed responsibility for the
raid Tuesday.

   Recently, U.S. intelligence has spotted agents of several
Arab terror groups with links to Iraq conducting surveillance
in Europe at American military installations. No attacks have
resulted from the surveillance, but the Bush administration
has warned Baghdad it will hold Iraq responsible for
terrorist attacks that occur during the Gulf crisis.
   In the Brussels incident, several men broke into Gen.
Douglass's house and knocked out his aide, while confederates
waited outside. The dazed aide, who said he was also drugged
by the attackers, has been unable so far to provide a full,
detailed account of the incident.

   Neil Bush Concedes He Stood to Benefit
   From Silverado's Credit Line to Partner

   WASHINGTON -- Neil Bush conceded that while he was a
director of Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association, he
stood to benefit financially from a $900,000 line of credit
he sought from the thrift for a business partner.
   The president's son, testifying in a hearing on the Office
of Thrift Supervision's conflict-of-interest charges against
him, also acknowledged that other aspects of the proposed
line of credit for Good International Inc., run by real
estate developer Kenneth Good, were "unusual." Mr. Bush
agreed with OTS lawyers that it was abnormal that no
collateral was sought to back the line of credit, but
insisted that wasn't important because "there was never any
intention that the line of credit be funded."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bush also conceded that it was unclear whether Mr.
Good even had that much collateral because the ailing Western
real estate markets had hurt his business. Silverado failed
in December 1988, and the government says it will cost
taxpayers about $1 billion to bail out its depositors.
   Mr. Bush, who didn't attend the previous two days of
hearings here, was feisty and impatient through three hours
of testimony. He veered from the questions posed to him to
deliver a broad defense of his actions, saying he "never had
a doubt" that he had no conflict of interest despite his
business ties to Mr. Good and another large Silverado
borrower, Bill Walters.
   Mr. Bush, an outside director for Silverado from 1985 to
1988, argued that Silverado was the victim of an economic
downturn. "When real estate values go from X to one-third of
X, the success of the institution is impaired," Mr. Bush
said. "Not for any wrongdoing, not because the board of
directors didn't act properly, but because of the
circumstances."
   Mr. Good was an investor in Mr. Bush's oil and gas
company, JNB Exploration Co. He formed Good International to
participate with another company of Mr. Bush's, JNB
International Inc., in a consortium to seek oil and gas
business in Argentina. The Argentine government originally
requested the line of credit as proof of financial viability,
but later agreed to accept Mr. Good's personal guarantee, Mr.
Bush said. The line of credit was approved by the Silervado
board, with Mr. Bush abstaining, but was never extended.
   The OTS has charged that the credit line would have
benefited Mr. Bush and would have violated restrictions on
the size of loans to thrift employees. Mr. Bush maintained in
written testimony in August that he never expected any
benefit because the credit line wasn't to be drawn on.
   But under questioning yesterday, Mr. Bush said that
because the line of credit was intended to help Good
International and JNB International gain oil and gas
business, he could have benefited. "I had hoped that as a
result of bidding and as a result of getting qualified and as
a result of drilling wells, that there would be some
benefit," he said.
   Mr. Bush's statement could prove to be a significant
weapon for the OTS, because it specifically has charged him
with "attempting to bring about a transaction that, if
consummated, would have resulted in benefit to himself."
   Under questioning from OTS attorney Stephen Hershkowitz,
Mr. Bush insisted that the Argentine government was willing
to accept the letter of credit as proof of financial strength
even though it was made clear it wouldn't be funded. "It was
bells and whistles," Mr. Bush said. "I know it sounds like
complete and utter nonsense."
   The OTS has charged Mr. Bush with violating
conflict-of-interest regulations in two other instances. Only
a month after the board approved the line of credit,
Silverado accepted $3 million from Mr. Good in exchange for
releasing more than $11.5 million in collateral because Mr.
Good claimed he was almost insolvent. The OTS says Mr. Bush
erred in not telling the Silverado board that at the time Mr.
Good had an option to invest $3 million in JNB Exploration.
Mr. Bush said yesterday he would have made the disclosure,
but the option to invest the $3 million wasn't "firm."
   OTS also has charged that Mr. Bush shouldn't have voted on
more than $100 million in loans to Mr. Walters, another real
estate developer, because a bank controlled by Mr. Walters
had loaned JNB Exploration $1,750,000. Mr. Good and Mr.
Walters had at least $130 million in loans and other
transactions from Silverado, and the thrift had a loss of at
least $60 million on the loans.
   Mr. Bush yesterday reiterated his argument that he had no
conflict of interest in the Walters transactions because he
didn't invest in Mr. Walters' companies and thus wouldn't
benefit from the loans. "He never once asked me, `Neil, how
are we going to get this deal through?'" Mr. Bush said. "My
loyalty was to Silverado."
   The OTS is seeking a cease-and-desist order against Mr.
Bush, a mild sanction that would bar him from violating
conflict-of-interest regulations in the future.
   Mr. Bush was the last of 11 witnesses to testify in three
days of hearings here. The administrative law judge who
presided over the hearing, Daniel Davidson, will consider the
case and make a recommendation to the OTS director in early
January. OTS Director Timothy Ryan then has until early May
to make a final decision.
   Last week, Mr. Bush and 11 other officials of Silverado or
its holding company were named in a separate $200 million
civil lawsuit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
alleged "gross negligence" in operating the thrift.

   Blasting Northrop
   Comes to Light

   LOS ANGELES -- Northrop Corp.'s new chairman, Kent Kresa,
tried to dig out from the avalanche of controversy descending
on the defense contractor, saying his mandate is to make the
company's businesses "world class."
   But the chairman's rosy comments to a group of reporters
here came as a letter from the Air Force surfaced blasting
Northrop for "recurring program problems," and a trade
publication said Northrop's Tacit Rainbow missile has failed
a number of recent tests. Consequently, Defense Week reported
in its latest editions, the $3.7 billion program is in
jeopardy of seeing its funding canceled on Capitol Hill.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The letter, dated June 5, was sent to Mr. Kresa by Jack
Welch Jr., the Air Force acquisition chief. It said a review
of the company's programs disclosed some of them to have
"shown improvement," but "others, including Tacit Rainbow and
key classified programs, continue to reflect poor
performance."
   "Because these problems have been occurring at multiple
Northrop divisions, we are doing an in-depth review . . . to
assess whether root causes are in corporate policies,
procedures and management practices, relevant to all of your
business."
   Calling the problems "most serious," Mr. Welch indicated
he would meet with Mr. Kresa in July to go over the review
and "consider your next steps." A copy of the letter, which
is stamped "Competition Sensitive," was obtained by The Wall
Street Journal.
   Mr. Kresa declined to comment on the specifics of the
letter or the review, which he said has been completed. He
did concede that there were "some suggestions of things we
could do better," and that the company has "a lot of actions
under way" to shore up its military projects.
   Nonetheless, he called the Air Force's overall findings
"very favorable" and said he "had no quarrels with the
report."
   A spokesman for Mr. Welch's office at the Pentagon
declined to comment immediately on either the letter or the
review. But an investigator for Rep. John Dingell (D.,
Mich.), who is planning to hold follow-up congressional
hearings soon into Northrop's contracting activities, said he
has been briefed on the review and termed it "devastating."
Told that Mr. Kresa had said its conclusions were generally
favorable, he added: "That's diametrically opposed to what I
understand."
   As for Tacit Rainbow, Defense Week reported that the
missile recently failed to hit its target for the ninth time
in 15 test flights, and the program is at least three years
behind schedule. The Air Force yesterday confirmed those test
results and said it was now conducting "a thorough
engineering review" to get to the bottom of the trouble.
   Mr. Kresa played down the problems with the weapon, which
is designed to be launched by a B-52 bomber and then loiter
in the air before zeroing in on an enemy's radar. "We're
trying to do a very sophisticated job at a very low cost," he
said.
   Mr. Kresa, who has been Northrop's chief executive officer
since January and president since 1987, was named chairman
last week, when Thomas V. Jones announced he was stepping
down. Mr. Jones's departure was clouded, however, by an
international arbitrator's ruling that Northrop tried to
bribe South Korean officials to buy the company's F-20
fighter planes.
   Northrop also has been excoriated on Capitol Hill lately,
with the Government Operations and the Energy and Commerce
committees of the House holding hearings to attack Northrop's
work on the MX missile, B-2 Stealth bomber, AV-8B Harrier jet
and air-launched cruise missile.
   Both panels also are planning for more hearings and have
pledged to subpoena Northrop officials to testify, if need
be. Meanwhile, the House Judiciary subcommittee on criminal
justice announced that it would focus on Northrop's conduct
while holding a hearing next month on the Pentagon's
debarment process.
   Mr. Kresa said that, although he anticipates "adversarial"
proceedings with Congress, he would gladly appear provided
that he was given ample time to prepare. "We don't want to
face a hearing where we don't know what's going on," he said,
explaining why Northrop executives had declined to show up at
the most recent round of hearings.
   He contended that Northrop mainly will have to answer to
"problems the company has already addressed . . . a long time
ago," adding that it has taken a number of steps to "operate
the entire business at the highest ethical level we can."
   "First we have to gain the confidence of our customer,"
the Defense Department, Mr. Kresa acknowledged, "and then the
confidence of Congress."

   Management:
   Lure of Legacies Perks Up Directors
   ----

INSURANCE (INS)
</IN>
<LP>
   Charity, it's said, begins at home. But for a growing
number of corporate directors, it is being bankrolled in the
board room.
   Some of the nation's largest corporations are quietly
giving their directors the ability to leave handsome nest
eggs to the charity or charities of their choice -- at no
cost to the directors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's the new million-dollar board perquisite. There's one
big catch: The gift isn't given until the director dies.
Payable to the designated charities upon death, the gift is
financed by insurance policies taken out by the company on
the director's life.
   Typically, the policies will mean an eventual tax-free
windfall of between $500,000 and $2 million for the board
member's alma mater, favorite disease-fighting effort or
other worthy cause. The average legacy is $1 million.
   "This allows a person to have an eternal impact, to really
leave something for generations to come," says E. Webb
Bassick IV, an executive compensation partner at Hewitt &amp;
Associates, management consultants based in Chicago.
   Companies say the perk helps them to lure the most
desirable directors and keep them on board. Attracting and
retaining directors isn't an easy task these days, say
executive recruiters. Mere cash doesn't cut it any longer, as
increased responsibilities and liability concerns prompt many
prospective directors to reject board invitations and many
incumbents to leave sooner. A recent Korn/Ferry International
survey finds that nearly half of the major companies it
polled expect at least one director to leave this year.
   "If you're having difficulty getting directors to sit on
your board, this could make the difference," says Mr.
Bassick.
   While the beneficiaries of the legacies will have to wait
for their money, the companies can take the cost of premiums
as an expense. More significantly, when the director does
die, the policy payoff can be included in the company's
charitable gift tax deduction since the money actually flows
from the insurer through the company and on to the intended
beneficiary.
   Still, many companies are reluctant to publicize the perk.
While promoters of the million-dollar legacies say more than
two dozen major companies offer it to their directors,
General Electric Co., PPG Industries Inc. and Westinghouse
Electric Corp., among others, don't disclose it. "We did not
deem this to be compensation," a Westinghouse spokesman says.
   "Corporations find there's a lot of focus on the magnitude
of director benefits, and they'd just like to avoid the issue
if they could," says Louis R. Richey, a vice president of
Ayco Corp., an American Express Co. unit that markets the
legacy perk.
   Some companies also worry that shareholders will think
such plans enrich directors, or look on any eleemosynary
activity as a misuse of corporate assets.
   But other companies see charitable giving as a public
relations plus. Waste Management Inc.'s proxy statement views
the perk as part of the company's "overall program to promote
charitable giving as a means to enhance the quality of life
in the many communities" in which it operates.
   Because the perk doesn't compensate the individual --
although a grateful college may send him or her some choice
game tickets -- there is no requirement that it be disclosed
as a board benefit. Lawyers also say disclosure can be ducked
since, during the director's lifetime, his or her legacy
isn't irrevocable. The corporation could decide to
countermand the bequest wishes.
   So far that hasn't happened. Insurers say no director
covered by such a policy has yet died.
   Alexander Trowbridge, former president of the National
Association of Manufacturers who sits on Waste Management's
board, says his intended beneficiary is Phillips Academy in
Andover, Mass., where he chairs the planned-giving committee.
Mr. Trowbridge, who calls the legacy benefit "a brilliant
idea," says he has urged the school's leadership to recommend
it to other directors-alumni.
   H. Brewster Atwater Jr., General Mills Inc.'s chairman and
chief executive officer, is on two boards with the perk --
his own and GE's. And while he says he intends to leave a
"good portion to education and a good portion to cultural
activities," Mr. Atwater hasn't notified the prospective
recipients "because I might find I may be more interested in
something else five years from now."
   Legacy policies for directors are so new that only a
handful of insurers offer them. Thus, some companies find it
cheaper to bid out the coverage themselves.
   Similar insurance has been available for well-to-do
individuals. But until recently, such policies haven't been
used as corporate benefits.
   Initially the program isn't cheap: annual premiums can
cost upwards of $25,000 per director. "You've really got to
dig behind the numbers and see if you agree with all the
assumptions," says Hewitt's Mr. Bassick, noting that
dividend, tax and interest rates should be considered. "As
with any life insurance product, you have to look at it in
the same decision process as building a new factory: Should
we be using the funds in another way?"
   A company should also ask what the buying power of today's
dollars will be decades from now. "We're looking at a face
value of $1.5 million and saying, `Boy, what a lasting gift.'
But in 30 years it may not buy the tribute we think of
today," notes Mr. Bassick.
   Health is always an important factor in buying life
insurance. But some companies are getting around that by
pairing older directors who may be poor risks with younger,
healthier board members. Under such "survivorship" policies,
the insurer doesn't pay out either director's benefits until
both are dead. That could complicate the selection of
would-be beneficiaries.
   "There's a lot of flexibility in policies. Premiums depend
on how long a company wants to pay out," says Amy Kalkbrenner
of Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co., a Hartford, Conn.,
insurer specializing in the "survivorship" policies.
   But this perk isn't for everyone. Smaller companies may
find the cost too great, or alternative uses of the money
preferable. And some large companies -- among them apparel
maker Hartmarx Corp. and pharmaceuticals giant Merck &amp; Co. --
say they've studied the legacy perk program but passed, for
various reasons.
   Some companies let directors pick the beneficiary. But PPG
asks directors to use their legacies to support education,
partly to foster a smarter work force for the future.
American Express and Union Pacific Corp. also have a say.
They split the proceeds between designated recipients and
their in-house charitable foundations.
   A few companies that offer the plan to directors are
expanding it to include senior executives. Usually in those
cases, though, employees share the insurance cost with the
company, and their coverage may be considerably less than
that afforded directors. At Bell Atlantic Corp., only outside
directors with at least five years' service are eligible for
the perk. Raymond W. Smith, the company's chairman, says
directors may decide to increase the $500,000 maximum legacy
in lieu of more cash.
   The legacy idea wins plaudits from many in the financial
planning and executive-compensation fields. "I don't think
that in the decade just past we were ready for this,"
Hewitt's Mr. Bassick says. "We were too cash-driven. Today,
charitable giving fits."

   L.A. Gear's Profit
   In Third Quarter
   Declined by 35%

   LOS ANGELES -- L.A. Gear Inc.'s fiscal third-quarter
profit fell 35% to $14.3 million, or 71 cents a share,
disappointing most analysts.
   The athletic-shoe maker said earlier this month it would
report lower profit in the quarter ended Aug. 31. Sales
climbed 40% to $300.3 million from $215 million. Net income
in the year-ago quarter was $22 million, or $1.21 a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   L.A. Gear said it expects fourth-quarter and full fiscal
year profit to fall from year-ago levels, in part because of
higher advertising expenses. Analysts had already been
predicting lower net so the forecast didn't come as any
surprise.
   Gross margins in the third quarter improved to 35.6% from
34.85%, less than some analysts expected. Faster sales growth
overseas than in the U.S., where sales produce higher
margins, restricted the gain, L.A. Gear said. In the quarter,
domestic sales grew only about 10% to $220 million.
   Advertising and promotional expense of $26.5 million in
the quarter included $9.3 million of expenses that had been
deferred from earlier in the year. L.A. Gear said it didn't
have any deferred advertising expense as of Aug. 31.
   To bolster market share, the company announced it is
boosting fourth-quarter advertising by about $2.5 million to
roughly $17 million. L.A. Gear's share has been increasing
since last year when it stood at about 10% of the $5 billion
athletic footwear market.
   Despite a difficult retail environment, "we continue to be
optimistic with regard to our potential and are enthusiastic
about our new products," said Robert Greenberg, chairman and
chief executive officer. The bigger advertising budget "is
intended to give us the greatest possible platform from which
to market our exciting new styles."
   In particular, L.A. Gear said it is launching a multimedia
campaign featuring San Francisco 49ers' quarterback Joe
Montana, to sell the company's Street Hiker shoe. L.A. Gear
didn't mention its new line advertised by singer Michael
Jackson. Some retailers have indicated that the shoe, which
costs up to $80 in some stores, is a flop.
   The shoe isn't a large percentage of projected sales or
inventory, said Kevin Ventrudo, chief financial officer.
"International sales have been good." A television commercial
with Mr. Jackson has helped the company's brand awareness
independent of the shoe's sales, he said.
   L.A. Gear fell 87.5 cents to $11.25 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday. The profit report was
issued after the close of trading.

   Figgie Chief's
   Son Is Named
   Vice Chairman

   Harry E. Figgie Jr., chairman and chief executive officer
of Figgie International Inc., brought his son, Harry E.
Figgie III, into the company as vice chairman, with the
assignment of speeding the adoption of new technology.
   The Figgies said during a joint interview that there isn't
any understanding that the move places Dr. Figgie, who is 37
years old, in position to succeed his 66-year-old father as
chief of the diversified company the senior Mr. Figgie
founded 26 years ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There has been speculation since Dr. Figgie joined the
Figgie International board in 1985 that the senior Mr. Figgie
would keep the top job in the family. However, when asked
whether he plans to retire at any given date, Mr. Figgie
responded, "Hell, no. This is an exciting time. Things I've
waited my whole career to see are happening now."
   The senior Mr. Figgie said the Willoughby, Ohio, company
has "a five-year window of opportunity to integrate new
technology" into its divisions. "There's been a technological
revolution," in machining, welding, assembly, product design
and other functions, he said, and in some industries the
company that successfully employs the new methods first "will
own the business."
   Figgie, which expects 1990 sales of nearly $1.4 billion,
supplies fire-protection and security systems and services;
produces sporting goods, electronics systems and industrial
products, and is involved in real estate development and
other activities.
   Dr. Figgie, who is an orthopedic surgeon as well as a
manufacturing executive, will phase out of his medical
practice over the next 18 to 36 months to head technology and
strategic planning at Figgie. He will be a member of a new
three-member office of the chairman, which will include the
senior Mr. Figgie and Vincent A. Chiarucci, 60, the company's
president and chief operating officer.
   The senior Mr. Figgie said those divisions serving the
construction industry have experienced a rapid drop in orders
during the current quarter. The company is cutting employment
and speeding up the previously planned consolidation of
certain units to adjust to the lower business volume, he
said. He declined to make an earnings forecast.
   Dr. Figgie has headed Clark-Reliance Co., a family-owned
manufacturer of valves, controls and instrumentation since
1975, when he was entering Case Western University's School
of Medicine. In addition to his medical degree, Dr. Figgie
has undergraduate degrees in bio-medical engineering and
accounting and a master's degree in factory automation. He
currently is an assistant clinical professor of medicine at
Case and has a surgical practice specializing in artificial
joint replacement.
   Dr. Figgie said he had "reached a fork in the road" where
he had to concentrate exclusively on business or medicine. He
said he chose business because he finds the application of
new manufacturing technologies exciting and challenging.

   Heard on the Street:
   Mideast Crisis Paradox: Prices of Big Oil Firms'
   Stocks Are Down Since Aug. 2 Kuwait Invasion
   ----

OIL, INTEGRATED MAJORS (OIL)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- In its rush to analyze the effects of the
Middle East crisis, the stock market seems to be all but
ignoring the most glaringly obvious beneficiary.
   Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the price of crude
oil has almost doubled and that of gasoline has spurted about
30%. Not surprisingly, stocks of oil consumers, such as
chemical companies and airlines, are down, and those of
oil-service firms are up.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the stocks of companies feeling the most immediate and
significant effects -- the major "integrated" oil companies
-- haven't risen at all. In fact, they have fallen.
   Shares of Mobil, Exxon, Kerr-McGee, Phillips Petroleum and
Chevron, among others, are all down from their Aug. 2
invasion-day price. Others, such as Arco, British Petroleum
and Unocal, are up, but none by more than a few percentage
points. And this is so even though the earnings outlook for
the integrated majors has brightened considerably.
   "As far as the oil stocks are concerned, the invasion of
Kuwait never took place," says PaineWebber analyst Bryan
Jacoboski.
   In fact, the Dow Jones index of major integrated oil
companies is actually down by 3% since Aug. 1. "I've been
mystified that they haven't gone up," says First Boston's
William Randol.
   Analysts have a great many reasons for this -- but none of
them really explain the failure of stocks to reflect the
improved outlook for oil-industry profits. Indeed, they have
so many reasons, one suspects that they, too, are groping for
an answer. "The market has its own logic," says Salomon
Brothers' Bernard Picchi.
   The logic, in this case, is as follows: Oil companies reap
significant profits from chemicals, which have been hurt by
developments in the Middle East. And the price of gasoline,
analysts note, hasn't risen by as much as crude -- thus,
profit margins at the marketing end of the business have all
but disappeared.
   Still others make the point that because the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stock index is down by 15% since Aug. 1, oil
stocks haven't done all that badly in relative terms. And
then there is the argument of Alan Gaines, president of
institutional broker Gaines &amp; Berland -- that a higher oil
price will cause a broad recession and thus lower demand for
oil in the future.
   All of these points are worthy of thought, but none change
a simple fact: Earnings of the integrated oil majors should
be up -- way up, unless oil prices collapse almost
immediately. Mr. Picchi, of Salomon, says "we're looking for
a 25% to 30% upward revision in profits for 1991 versus our
previous forecast," assuming that the average price of oil
next year is $27 a barrel.
   William Brown, of Kidder, Peabody, assumes an oil price of
only $25 a barrel in 1991. His earnings estimates are up by
about 20%. The magnitude of the trend may not be clear, but
the direction is.
   Mr. Picchi argues that even before the invasion, he and
some others were predicting that oil's price would rise --
though much more gradually -- and that stocks may have
already reflected that view.
   "The five-year improvement we expected in the price of oil
took place in five weeks," he says. But, Mr. Picchi concedes,
it is one thing to predict higher oil prices; it is another
to experience them. And, he adds, oil companies now are
trading at a relatively modest five or six times projected
cash flow.
   Analysts make the point that no one is sure how long the
Mideast crisis will last. And eventually, according to the
common wisdom, oil prices will retreat -- perhaps severely.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for future delivery
in April 1992 is priced at $26.54 a barrel -- $13 less than
oil for immediate delivery, reflecting the view that prices
are bound to fall off sharply.
   But it is also true that if war breaks out, oil prices may
rise. And whatever happens, everyone's estimate for future
oil prices is higher than it was on Aug. 1.
   "A lot of other factors are involved," PaineWebber's Mr.
Jacoboski explains. Government, he says, may mandate
conservation, or raise taxes on fuels, or encourage people
who burn gasoline to switch to windmills, and so forth.
   But none of these factors overly discouraged Mr. Jacoboski
when it was time to advise his clients. Before the invasion
he was touting five of the 17 companies he follows; now, he
recommends 15.
   His and other people's clients don't seem to be listening.
"Fund managers hate to be blindsided," he says, adding: "If
you accept that oil prices will be higher, you are accepting
that the economy will be weak. You have to restructure your
entire portfolio."

   Industrials Fall 32.17 to Year's Low

   NEW YORK -- The stock market retreated again as crude oil
prices surged as high as $40 a barrel.
   An early softening in the price of oil had fueled hopes
for a rally in stocks. But an opening burst of stock buying
proved briefer than many investors expected.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After advancing more than 22 points in the first 10
minutes of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average quickly
headed lower. The index hit a 50-point loss shortly after
noon EDT, triggering the New York Stock Exchange's "uptick
rule" restricting computer-driven program selling.
   The industrial average ended with a 32.17-point loss at
2427.48, a new low for the year. Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock
Index dropped 4.09 to 300.97, and the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index fell 2.16 to 165.36.
   Declining stocks totaled 1,182 and advancing issues 395.
   "This morning was a classic bear trap," sucking investors
in on false hopes, said James C. Andrews, first vice
president in charge of institutional trading at Janney
Montgomery Scott.
   Those hopes were pinned on falling oil prices, which were
expected to open as much as $1 a barrel lower in New York
trading. Oil prices had declined sharply in European trading
after President Bush announced late Wednesday that he would
release five million barrels of oil from the nation's
strategic petroleum reserves.
   But light sweet crude oil for November delivery opened
only about 87 cents a barrel lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, and soon recovered to surge past Wednesday's
closing levels -- moving briefly above $40 a barrel. The
spike in oil prices drove stock prices to their lows for the
day. By the end of the day, the November crude oil contract
had settled to $39.54 a barrel, up 87 cents from Wednesday.
   Big Board volume totaled 182,690,000 shares, up from
Wednesday's 155,570,000.
   Bank stocks led the decline in what Ralph Bloch, chief
market analyst at Raymond James &amp; Associates, called
quarterend "window undressing."
   So-called window dressing has often been cited as a cause
for gains in stock prices at the end of previous quarters as
portfolio managers bought winning stocks to enhance their
portfolios before the quarter-end review.
   Mr. Bloch said portfolio managers may be dumping the worst
performers now -- primarily the bank stocks -- to get them
off the books before the quarter ends.
   But there were plenty of other reasons to sell bank shares
yesterday.
   NCNB dropped 3 1/8 to 20 1/8 after announcing late
Wednesday that it is increasing its loan and lease loss
allowance by $65 million. The increased provision will slash
the bank holding company's third-quarter profit to between 50
cents and 60 cents a share, down from $1.45 a share in the
like quarter last year.
   Bank of Boston said its third-quarter loss would total
between $200 million and $250 million, including the addition
of $150 million to $200 million to its loan-loss provisions.
The bank, whose stock dropped 3/8 to 7 1/8, also cut its
dividend to 10 cents a share from 31 cents.
   Landmark Bancshares fell 1 to 7 after it said its
third-quarter earnings would fall to as little as 12 cents a
share from 51 cents a share a year ago.
   Other bank stocks were also down. Citicorp led the
most-active list with a 3/4point loss to 13 3/4. Wells Fargo
lost 3 5/8 to 42 3/4, Chase Manhattan eased 1/8 to 11,
Chemical Banking lost 7/8 to 14 1/8, BankAmerica dropped 3/4
to 19 1/4, and Security Pacific lost 1 1/2 to 19 1/2.
   Market players have been saying all week that the stock
market is due for a technical bounce. And while the market's
inability to support a 22-point advance by the Dow
industrials yesterday morning discouraged some, others are
still saying the bottom is near.
   "At some point the market will have largely discounted a
war," as well as a recession, said Oppenheimer market
strategist Michael Metz. "At that point {the market} will
turn." Mr. Metz believes the market is just about there.
   The stock market wasn't without its winners yesterday.
Among the 30 Dow industrials, PepsiCo added 1/8 to 22 1/8,
while Procter &amp; Gamble rose 1/4 to 72 3/8.
   Union Carbide added 5/8 to 14 7/8. The company's board
authorized a series of initiatives designed to enhance value
for stockholders and strengthen its businesses. The moves
include the repurchase of about 14% of its shares outstanding
through a "Dutch auction" tender offer.
   MCA, which jumped more than 25 points in the previous two
sessions on expectations of an acquisition agreement with
Matsushita Electric, retreated 2 1/4 to 59 in heavy trading.
   General Electric lost 3 3/8 to 51 5/8. A federal ruling in
June removed limitations on the damages for which GE is
liable under a 1971 contract with Washington Public Power
Supply System. The ruling, which was unsealed Tuesday, found
that GE had hidden serious doubts about its design of a giant
nuclear-containment vessel for a WPPSS power plant. A trial
this summer brought by WPPSS against GE ended in a mistrial.
WPPSS has requested a new trial without a jury on the issue
of GE's liability in the case.
   USAir tumbled 7/8 to 15 1/8. The airline operator said
late Wednesday that it is suspending its quarterly dividend
indefinitely and deferring delivery of 16 new Boeing jets for
several years. Boeing fell 1 1/4 to 39 5/8.
   Unisys lost 1 5/8, to 5 3/8. The company suspended its
dividend and said it expects to report a loss in the current
third quarter. Unisys lost $4.25 a share in the third quarter
last year, including the effect of restructuring charges.
   Whitman added 1/2 to 18 3/4 on heavy volume. Goldman Sachs
made positive comments about the stock yesterday. The
Chicago-based company has announced a restructuring program
to transform itself into an operating company focused on
foods and soft drinks, from a diversified holding company.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index slid 4.63
to 305.43. Volume totaled 16,780,000 shares.

   Chase Manhattan Corp. said it was firing 98 workers in its
foreign-exchange and money-market operations in London in the
first wave of a plan to trim its non-U.S. operations by 1,600
employees.
   The bank holding company said it also had trimmed five
workers from its Frankfurt foreign-exchange operations and
closed its Zurich dealing room, eliminating 20 jobs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The cuts are part of a decision, which Chase announced a
week ago, to trim costs by shedding 5,000 employees
world-wide. Chase has about 2,600 remaining U.K. employees
and 4,500 throughout Europe. A spokesman declined to say how
many more of the planned non-U.S. reductions would come from
its London and European pool of workers. Chase intends to
complete all of its the staff reductions by year end, the
spokesman added.
   The cutbacks stem from the company's deteriorating
commercial real estate loan portfolio.

   Bondholders of Australia-based Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.
approved the sale of its brewery assets to its 58%-owned Bell
Resources Ltd. unit.
   The holders of US$200 million of 10-year 5 3/4%
subordinated convertible bonds carried the resolution in
London to sell the division. Bell plans to sell a 50% stake
in the breweries to Lion Nathan Ltd., a New Zealand-based
brewer, and operate them as a joint venture.

   The clearance followed by a day Alan Bond's resignation as
chairman and a director of the company, to pave the way for
the financially troubled concern to be restructured. Mr. Bond
foreshadowed his departure in July, saying he would step down
if European holders of some Bond Corp.-related securities
approved the sale of the company's Australian brewing
interests. Even though European investors cleared the brewery
sale yesterday, the deal could still collapse unless a group
of investors who hold US$510 million of debentures issued by
Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd. in the U.S. agree to sell their
securities back to the company at a discount.

   Car Maker's Pretax Profit
   Fell Almost 13% in 1st Half

   Consolidated pretax profit at Fiat S.p.A. fell almost 13%
in the first half, reflecting increased competition in its
home market and weakening demand for new cars in Europe
generally.
   The Italian car maker forecast a tough second half, saying
the Gulf crisis, higher inflation and the country's
continuing budgetary problems were likely to hurt business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consolidated pretax profit fell to 2.45 trillion lire
($2.09 billion) in the first half from 2.81 trillion lire in
the same period of 1989, while consolidated net revenue rose
to 30.31 trillion lire from 27.11 trillion.
   Fiat's market share in Italy fell to 54% in the first six
months from 58% a year earlier. Fiat has encountered strong
competition on its own turf from Ford Motor Co., which has
doubled its market share in Italy to 7% this year following a
strong marketing campaign for its new-style Fiesta model,
which competes head-on with Fiat's top-selling Uno.
   In the wider European market, Fiat's sales rose to
1,080,000 vehicles in the first half from 1,040,000 vehicles
a year earlier, but its market share slipped to 15% from
15.5%.
   Another factor in the fall in the group's profitability
was heavy losses by Fiat's Brazilian subsidiaries, totaling
more than 300 billion lire.

   Au Printemps S.A. said it had consolidated net profit of
57 million French francs ($10.9 million) for the first half
of 1990, compared with a year-earlier loss of 50 million
francs.
   The French retailing group said that part of the
improvement reflected its decision to no longer include in
its results its 25% stake in the distribution group
Euromarche S.A. During the first half of 1989, Euromarche cut
about 30 million francs off Printemps' earnings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Printemps said earnings were also helped by the use of
proceeds from 1989 asset sales -- totaling about 800 million
francs -- to pay down its debt and reduce costs.
   Revenue climbed 2% to 13.96 billion francs from 13.66
billion. Pretax profit from current operations surged to 192
million francs from 92 million.
   Printemps wouldn't forecast full-year earnings because of
the unknown impact of the Persian Gulf crisis on demand
during the second half. However, it said it expects a
significant improvement in its current operating profit for
the year.
   For 1989, Printemps had consolidated net profit of 524
million francs on revenue of 28.5 billion francs.

   International Energy Agency to Urge
   Members to Be Ready to Use Oil Stocks

   The International Energy Agency will urge its members at a
meeting in Paris today to be ready to dip into oil
stockpiles, but it won't call for a coordinated release of
emergency supplies at this time.
   Officials of the IEA, made up of 21 major oil consuming
nations, still don't see any real evidence of oil shortages,
and as a result are unlikely to recommend the group initiate
its standing emergency oil-sharing mechanism. The IEA
governing board is meeting to review the world oil-supply
picture in the wake of disruptions caused by the Middle East
crisis. The meeting will be its third since Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We are not pulling the trigger," George Quincy Lumsden
Jr., the IEA's director of oil market developments, said in
an interview.
   Nor is it likely members of the group will act
individually to follow the U.S. in releasing oil from
emergency storage to try to hold down runaway prices.
Government officials of both Germany and Japan said, in fact,
they had no such plans.
   Oil prices resumed their run-up, meanwhile, after falling
briefly in the wake of President Bush's announcement that the
U.S. will withdraw five million barrels as a "test" of the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The U.S. futures price of
November crude reached a record $40.10 a barrel, before
settling at $39.54, up 87 cents.
   Oil prices softened $1 a barrel as European and Asian
markets opened yesterday on the basis of the scheduled
drawdown from the U.S. reserve. But after traders focused on
the token size of the withdrawalless than 10% of the world's
oil needs for one day -- and new rumors of a Middle East war,
prices turned up again.
   The turnabout dashed hopes of a rally in the U.S. stock
market, and helped drive down stock and bond prices. On the
International Petroleum Exchange in London, Brent crude for
November delivery settled 60 cents higher at $38.55 a barrel,
after being as low as $36.40. On the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the surge in crude pushed October heating oil above
$1.04 a gallon, up 1.8 cents. October gasoline closed 2.59
cents a gallon higher at nearly $1.03.
   In testimony before a House Energy subcommittee, U.S.
Energy Secretary James Watkins tried to damp expectations
that the SPR test would lower oil prices. He said that the
"psychological impact" of the test is significant, but "we're
not going into the test with the idea that oil prices will go
down $8 a barrel."
   Mr. Watkins explained that there is a danger in implying
to the public that prices will drop after a test drawdown,
because they might not fall. "If Saddam Hussein makes another
threat, the market would shoot up again," he said. The oil
reserve "is not the only thing affecting the marketplace."
   But he said the test "shows we're serious," and he
characterized it as a "first step" toward possible broader
use, if the situation warrants.
   Several lawmakers urged Mr. Watkins to push U.S. allies to
tap their reserves, too.
   But IEA officials were told yesterday by the U.S.
government that the step it was taking "does not signify any
decision to draw down the SPR." Such a decision, IEA
officials were told in a communication from Washington, would
be made only in coordination with other nations in the group.
   "This test is a unilateral action to ensure the SPR system
is operational," the U.S. message to the IEA said. It added
that the U.S. isn't seeking similar tests by other countries
with strategic oil reserves.
   Government oil in storage in consuming nations totals
about one billion barrels, with the bulk -- 590 million
barrels -- in the U.S. facility. Japan and Germany share most
of the remainder. Other nations of the IEA require oil
companies that are selling fuels within their borders to
maintain certain levels of commercial inventories, which
serve as their national reserves.
   IEA officials said the governing board could recommend
that other countries test their systems. At the very least,
the officials said, the member-nations will be urged to go
through final preparations to make sure they could quickly
release oil from stockpiles, if actual shortages do develop.
   Also, IEA officials said other steps may be recommended,
including government calls to oil companies to buy less oil
and use up some excess inventories. Member countries likely
will be encouraged to intensify energy conservation as well.
   In the oil industry, it's generally expected that the IEA
will conclude today's meeting by issuing a statement similar
to previous ones. It would state that supplies currently are
adequate and that drawdowns of strategic inventories aren't
necessary at this time. "Nonetheless, for the first time, the
IEA might begin to warm to the idea that measures could
eventually be used to address price movements," reported
Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
   An IEA official appeared to agree. "All the tools we've
got are written on a supply basis," he said. "Nevertheless,
the price problem is a supply problem, if the market never
lies."

   Senate Clears Bill
   Giving the SEC
   Greater Powers

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed legislation that would
give the Securities and Exchange Commission controversial new
enforcement powers, expanding the agency's fining authority
beyond insider-trading cases.
   The bill, approved by voice vote, also would give the
agency "cease and desist" power to stop alleged wrongdoers.
Moreover, it contains a provision that would better protect
penny-stock investors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The legislation, expected to be approved soon by the
House, is expected to allow the SEC to handle more cases
in-house through its own administrative law judges rather
than in federal courts. While the administrative law judges
are forced to use identical burdens of proof as federal court
judges, they are seen by some as being more sympathetic to
the SEC.
   That has made some defense lawyers skittish that clients
won't get the same treatment they can expect now. But the SEC
dismisses that complaint, contending that the bill would
allow the agency to better tailor the punishment to the
crime. "It is not an unreasonable conclusion for people to
say the enforcement program in the '80s has uncovered enough
problems that we need more flexibility and to add some
economic deterrence," said SEC enforcement director William
McLucas. "My view is that's what this bill does."
   The bill was proposed by the SEC two years ago in an
effort to fill what it saw were holes in its enforcement
program. The legislation also would give the agency the
authority to ask courts to bar people from serving public
companies as officers and directors if they have violated
securities laws.
   Under the fining authority, the agency could impose
maximum penalties of as much as $100,000 per violation for
individuals, $500,000 for corporations or the amount gained
through illegal activities.
   The penny-stock provision would give the commission the
power to take enforcement action against penny-stock
promoters, many of whom are not registered with the
commission. Promoters found to be wrongdoers could be barred
from being associated with a brokerage in the future. The
bill also features new risk-disclosure requirements telling
customers the nature and level of risks in the penny-stock
area. Those requirements also extend to the way brokers deal
with their customers.
   The penny-stock provision also would give the SEC the
power to place new limitations on so-called blank-check
pools, which solicit investor funds without identifying the
use of the proceeds. Moreover, the bill instructs the SEC to
press exchanges to create an improved pricing system for
penny stocks.
   Separately, the Senate Banking Committee unanimously
approved the nomination of Richard Roberts to the SEC. Mr.
Roberts is a lawyer who was a former aide to Sen. Richard
Shelby (D., Ala.), a member of the committee. Mr. Roberts,
who was nominated to fill a Democratic slot on the
commission, is expected to be approved soon by the full
Senate.

   Rowan Cos. said third-quarter net of about 10 cents a

   In the year-earlier third quarter, the energy service
concern had a net loss of about $211,000, or five cents a
share, on revenue of about $31.4 million. A spokesman said
the latest third-quarter net will be about $7.2 million, but
would say only that revenue "will definitely be better" than
last quarter -- referring to second-quarter revenue of about
$36 million.

In 1984, its last profitable year, Rowan had restated net of

$198.4 million.

   Phony War:
   Sturm und Drang

   After Poland fell to Hitler in 1939, the stalemate in
Europe became known as "the phony war." The phrase could just
as well describe the Great Budget Showdown of 1990: It's more
sitzkrieg than blitzkrieg.
   The rhetoric is flying, everyone is rattling sabers,
there's a great cry over potential casualties, but none of
the central players really wants a war. They all want a deal.
The rank-and-file politicians are treating the rest of us to
great theater, but it's mostly just uniforms and parades. The
real debate is going on, behind closed doors, among eight
middle-aged white men who will almost certainly soon emerge
with what they hope will be an immaculate conception. Both
sides want an agreement too badly to let Gramm-Rudman's
budget cuts strike this Monday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While most budget details remain cloistered, the spectacle
is too rich to let pass by. Everyone outside is nervous,
edgy. Some of the Democratic Study Group, the Central
Committee for House liberals, held a meeting and talked of
mutiny. When GOP House leader Bob Michel said he wanted to
give up a capital-gains cut, he was besieged by complaining
members. A few spoke of mounting a petition to challenge his
leadership at a GOP caucus.
   The metaphors grew more florid by the day. Rep. Steve
Gunderson (R., Wis.) staged a "countdown to Armageddon"; he
kept it up despite editorial ridicule. Others spoke of
"Judgment Day." Members lined up one-after-another in the
House to inoculate themselves from political blame. "It's an
Alice-in-Wonderland World," declared Connecticut Rep. Nancy
Johnson, who at least captured the essence of the spectacle.
They all want a deal so they can say the dread "sequester"
isn't their fault.
   When President Bush finally blamed Democrats for the
impasse this Wednesday, Democrats exploded. Rep. Bill Gray of
Philadelphia replied that the president "should stop playing
politics with the nation's economy." An odd accusation,
coming from a politician.
   Much of this drama is the political direction of White
House budget director Dick Darman, the David Lynch of
American politics. He's long believed in the immaculate
conception theory of the budget. The "sequester" time bomb is
his way to force the politicians to act. So he ordered
federal departments to come up with painful layoffs.
Apocalypse Darman: Carnage. Widows without grocery money.
   Mr. Darman may even have avoided a splendid chance to make
budget cuts go down more easily. The potential evasion was
provided by the so-called Civiletti memo, the Carter-era
judgment on shutting down the government. The memo, based on
an obscure federal law, arguably gives Mr. Bush power to
continue essential federal services even with a sequester. In
other words, an apocalypse seems avoidable. Airplanes can
keep flying after all.
   But Mr. Darman didn't bring this stunning news to the
budget table until this week. If he'd done it several months
ago, President Bush might have had more bargaining leverage.
He could have kept the pressure on Congress for budget cuts,
without having to spend weeks threatening a sequester
catastrophe that he too would be blamed for.
   The charitable speculation is that Mr. Darman didn't know
about the memo until recently. He distrusts lawyers (nothing
wrong with that) and has kept both the Justice Department and
the White House counsel's office isolated from his planning.
The less charitable (and unproven) inference, made by some in
the White House, is that Mr. Darman knew the memo's
importance but thought it might interfere with his summit
strategy.
   Mr. Darman's conceit is that a budget summit can settle
basic political questions by removing them from politics. (He
didn't even want Mr. Bush to make his partisan speech this
week.) GOP Sen. Phil Gramm says the agreement will determine
the country's spending "blueprint" for the next five years.
But why should so much be settled by eight men in one room?
   Those of us who've doubted the Brady-Darman strategy
aren't confrontationists for the sport of it. A real
political war has the best chance of breaking the political
stalemate at the root of Washington's budget impasse. Sooner
or later the country needs another debate, to be settled by
voters, on just how much taxation and government Americans
want.
   Mr. Darman prefers the Perrier-filled room (no one smokes
anymore) that maximizes his own operating room but obscures
public understanding. And it looks like he's on the verge of
winning. Sequester paranoia is having its desired effect. By
all accounts the summiteers are close to a deal. The White
House has backed down on capital gains to accept indexing for
inflation (on future but apparently not past gains). It hopes
that indexing, plus other still murky "growth incentives,"
will protect its conservative flank.
   It will be fascinating to see if the elected rank-and-file
in Congress go along. House Republicans will need to be
persuaded about capital gains, while liberals will roar if
Social Security is cut (it was still on the table yesterday).
Of course, it is also part of the sitzkrieg strategy that
members won't get very much time to look. And that if they do
vote against it, they will be labeled "irresponsible" for
risking the collapse of government.
   It's a long shot, but the phony budget war might yet
become a real one.

   Union Carbide Authorizes Buy-Back
   Of 14% of Stocks to Halt Price Erosion

   Union Carbide Corp., hoping to check the steady erosion of
its stock price, announced a plan to buy back as much as 14%
of its shares, reduce debt and reap roughly $300 million from
certain asset sales.
   Although this year the Danbury, Conn., company decided
against a radical restructuring, it left open the possibility
of the kind of moves it disclosed yesterday as it sought to
regain investors' confidence. The company, whose emphasis on
petrochemicals makes it vulnerable to rising oil prices, also
took pains to say its quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share
is solid.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "What we're trying to do is send a message to investors
and potential investors that we are as concerned about our
share price as they are -- more so, I hope -- and intend to
do something about it," Robert D. Kennedy, Carbide's chairman
and chief executive officer, said in an interview. He added,
"The trading value of our shares is ludicrous."
   The announcement bolstered Carbide shares in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange as the overall market
continued to falter. Carbide rose 62.5 cents to close at
$14.875. The previous day's closing price had been a new
52-week low, down by more than half from the 52-week high of
$28.625.
   "We're encouraged to see management do some of the things
we thought they might do when we bought" the stock in the
first place, said James R. Ullman, a trustee at Batterymarch
Financial Management. He said the investment concern
currently holds 910,000 Carbide shares.
   But the details of the plan confirm that Carbide will
stick with its core businesses in chemicals and industrial
gases. One of the planned asset sales would shed 50% of the
company's carbon products business, but that accounted for
only 8.3% of Carbide's sales in the first half of 1990.
   "What it looks like is that the board is united behind
what are really very minor moves," said Paul C.
Christopherson, a chemicals industry analyst at Bear, Stearns
&amp; Co.
   The battering of Carbide's shares partly reflects
uncertainties about how the company will fare as it heads
into what may be a recession and a period of sustained higher
oil prices. Additional industrywide production capacity will
make it more difficult for petrochemical makers to recover
their higher oil-related raw material costs through higher
prices to their customers.
   But Mr. Kennedy insisted that Carbide will benefit over
the long haul by continuing to invest in what he called its
"aces," its chemicals and industrial gas segments. He said
the company's strengths would warrant an increase in the
dividend were it not for the turmoil in the Mideast and
instability in the economy.
   Mr. Kennedy said Carbide expects net "proceeds" from its
asset sales to total about $600 million, roughly half of it
cash, the remainder representing debt assumed by others. The
divestitures should result in a "small, nonrecurring charge"
to earnings in the 1990 fourth quarter or the 1991 first
quarter, he said.
   Carbide said it is in negotiations with several potential
partners over the sale of as much as a 50% stake in its
carbon products business. The business, which makes graphite
electrodes for the steel industry, had pretax operating
profit of $22 million in the first half of this year on sales
of $359 million.
   Carbide said it will divest itself of its 50% stakes in
Kemet Electronics Corp., which makes capacitors for the
electronics industry, and in Lincare Inc., which provides
oxygen tanks for medical needs in the home. The company also
plans certain asset sales in its retail gases business, where
it will transfer majority control to employees through a
stock ownership plan. A broader ownership plan will be
established for employees throughout Carbide.
   To buy back stock, Carbide will hold a so-called Dutch
auction for 20 million of its 143 million shares. Holders can
tender their shares within a range of prices to be specified
Oct. 1.

   Laura Ashley Holdings PLC, the troubled British apparel
and home-furnishings concern, said it would cut 18% of its
work force and close or sell seven United Kingdom
manufacturing plants in an effort to reduce overcapacity and
shift most of its production to foreign contract
manufacturing plants. Analysts have said the company's recent
slide in earnings, brought on in part by a slump in its U.S.
retail operations, has been exacerbated by high labor costs
in the U.K.
   The factory closings, which will eliminate about 1,000
jobs, will reduce Laura Ashley's in-house manufacturing
output to about 15% of all products, from 55% now, a company
spokesman said. The company also will cut an additional 500
employees from its world-wide retail operations, reducing the
total company work force to 6,600 from 8,100 at present.
</LP>

   Laura Ashley reported a pretax loss of #4.6 million ($8.6
million) for the year ended Jan. 27, despite an 18% rise in
sales. The company's worsening financial straits prompted
Laura Ashley last month to sell a 15% stake in the company to
Jusco Co., a Japanese chain-store operator.

   U.S. to Subsidize
   Wheat-Flour Sales
   To Soviet Union

   WASHINGTON -- The Agriculture Department, seeking to meet
the competitive challenge of the European Community, said it
will for the first time subsidize the sale of wheat flour to
the Soviet Union.
   The U.S. is prepared to offer export subsidies on 500,000
metric tons of flour under the department's Export
Enhancement Program, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
said. If the Soviets take advantage of the offer, the
business could keep U.S. flour mills busy for many months.
What's more, a 500,000 metric-ton sale, comparable to about
700,000 metric tons of wheat, would help boost sagging wheat
futures prices, according to industry officials and market
analysts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The department has been going to unprecedented lengths
lately to counter export subsidies being offered by France
and other EC countries at a time of bumper grain crops, huge
stockpiles and weak export demand. Earlier this month,
so-called U.S. export bonuses topped $50 a ton for the first
time, but that still was far short of the $150-a-ton French
subsidies.
   Under the Export Enhancement Program, exporters sell wheat
and other commodities at the world-market price and collect
bonuses in the form of surplus, government-owned commodities.
The bonuses make up the difference between higher U.S. prices
and world-market prices.
   The Bush administration has been under intense political
pressure from Wheat Belt lawmakers to do whatever it can to
shore up wheat prices. At the same time, the Soviets,
strapped for hard currency, have expressed interest in
obtaining $2 billion in U.S. credit for commodity purchases.
The administration has taken the position, however, that
Moscow must liberalize Soviet immigration law to qualify for
most-favored-nation status and export credit guarantees.
   Wheat sales to Moscow have been slow lately. The Soviets
have bought only 693,000 metric tons in the marketing year
that began June 1. "Right now we have no sales on the books,"
said Vincent Peterson, marketing director for U.S. Wheat
Associates, a trade promotion group. In the previous year,
the Soviets bought 4.3 million metric tons.
   The Soviets are expected to harvest a bumper grain crop of
230 million metric tons in 1990, including 104 million tons
of wheat. But they are losing much of the harvest to spoilage
and are having trouble transporting it to markets. At the
same time, there have been bread lines and sporadic bread
shortages in Moscow and other Soviet cities. A 500,000-ton
flour purchase would help mollify disgruntled Soviet
consumers.
   "That's a lot of flour," said Mr. Peterson. "We don't have
a lot of excess milling capacity. It will take U.S. mills the
better part of a year to produce that much."

   Chemical group Montedison S.p.A., Milan, Italy, said it
plans a capital increase of up to 2.5 trillion lire ($2.13
billion), in the event it decides to buy the 40% stake in its
Enimont S.p.A. joint venture currently held by Italian state
energy group Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, or ENI.
   Montedison also reported an 18% drop in consolidated
profit for the first half of this year, reflecting worsening
business conditions in the chemical sector.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The announcements came at a critical time for the group,
as it faces the decision whether to pay out the huge sums
required to achieve the control it has long sought over
Enimont, or whether to cut its losses, sell its stake to ENI
and effectively pull out of the Italian chemical business.
   Enimont was formed last year when ENI and Montedison
merged their base chemical businesses. But the joint venture,
in which each holds 40%, has been plagued by fundamental
disagreements over long-term strategy. Now the Italian
government has proposed that the venture should effectively
be auctioned between the partners, with ENI having the right
to name a price and Montedison the right of first refusal.

   U.S. OFFICIALS FEAR growing calls for a deal with Iraq.
   They believe Mitterrand's U.N. proposal is only the first
of many calls for negotiations with Saddam Hussein --
possibly trading withdrawal from Kuwait for access to a
Kuwaiti island in the Gulf, greater control of a rich border
oil field, and forgiveness of Iraq's $10 billion debt to
Kuwait.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Iraq probably could have had such an accord without
invading and bringing world opprobrium down on itself. But
the U.S. remains adamantly opposed to granting even symbolic
concessions, saying it could accept Iraq-Kuwait talks on
these issues only after an unconditional withdrawal.
   Meanwhile, officials privately worry that Kuwait's exiled
emir might cut a secret deal with Iraq, offering concessions
himself in return for restoration of his government.
                                                                                                       

   POLITICAL PRESSURES keep building on Bush as energy prices
rise. While officials hope the decision to tap the strategic
reserve will damp psychological pressures pushing prices up,
lawmakers criticize the White House refusal to take
additional measures. Democratic Sen. Lieberman calls for
prohibiting companies from charging "excessive prices" during
emergencies. GOP Sen. Packwood urges readoption of the
windfall-profits tax.
   Administration officials fear an abnormally cold winter or
a major refinery accident could send prices -- and political
pressure -- spiraling anew. Even as Bush jawbones oil
companies to keep prices down, Energy Department officials
complain there's nothing they can do to prevent the firms
from exporting gasoline and heating oil to Europe, where
prices are higher.
                                                                                                       

   WHOSE RECESSION? Officials seek a scapegoat in Greenspan.
   Bush aides continue to mute their criticism of the Fed
chairman in public, fearing that too much recession talk will
alarm consumers and further weaken the economy. But they step
up behind-the-scenes criticism of the Fed's reluctance to
lower interest rates in the face of worsening indicators.
   Many business economists share that view. Nearly 60% in a
recent survey say the Fed is being too stingy; normally, 60%
to 70% of the economists endorse whatever policy the Fed is
following. But Greenspan defenders warn the Fed can't offset
the damage that higher oil prices are doing.
   Despite its impatience with the Fed, the administration is
nowhere near choosing a replacement for Vice Chairman Manuel
Johnson, who quit almost four months ago.
                                                                                                       

   OFFICIALS DISMISS private suggestions from Syrian dictator
Assad that an Iraqi coup is possible soon; they say Saddam
Hussein's network of informers and habit of killing rather
than exiling foes make a successful plot unlikely. But the
administration, as well as Turkey's Ozal, say a coup might
occur if war breaks out.
                                                                                                       

   HONORARIUM HONEYMOON: Disclosure forms show that the day
after Illinois Rep. and GOP Senate candidate Lynn Martin was
married in 1987, she and her husband, a judge, traveled to
Orlando, where she pocketed $2,000 plus expenses for a
speech. Next they headed for Jamaica, where she attended a
five-day expenses-paid seminar, after which she went alone to
San Diego for another $2,000 speech. Her spokesman attributes
the busy schedule to the press of being a two-career couple.

   THE SLEAZE SWEEPSTAKES focuses on ethics complaints, money
givebacks.
   The House Democratic campaign committee -- itself
criticized in the past for fund raising on the yachts of S&amp;L
kingpins -- files an S&amp;L-related ethics committee complaint
against Oregon GOP Rep. Denny Smith. It also complains about
a loan to the GOP challenger to California Rep. George Brown.
Republicans counter with a complaint against Sen. Simon.
   Under pressure from his GOP opponent, Sen. Heflin returns
$2,000 to a PAC controlled by Sen. Cranston, one of the
Keating Five. GOP Rep. Pashayan, who has already returned
$26,000 in Keating-related contributions, gives back $1,000
from a Washington lobbyist who represented Iraq. In New
Hampshire, ex-Sen. Durkin hammers GOP candidate Bob Smith for
$31,000 in oil-industry contributions.
   The links get ever-more tenuous: Sen. Levin gives back a
donation from the PAC of a New York law firm that once
represented Charles Keating.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Quayle says he supports efforts "to limit the
terms of members of Congress, especially members of the House
and members of the Senate." . . . No limousine liberal,
former top Mondale aide and new Fannie Mae Chairman Jim
Johnson is spotted riding a school bus with his four-year-old
son. . . . Some House members, frustrated because they aren't
involved in either the Iraqi crisis or the budget talks, form

   MONTREAL -- BCE Inc. and Nynex Corp. are joining with a
Mexican financial concern to bid for control of Telefonos de
Mexico.
   The joint venture is the first group to announce it will
make an offer for a 20.4% TelMex equity stake held by the
Mexican government. The 20.4% block represents just over half
of TelMex's full-voting shares. Three other groups are
expected to join the bidding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Henri Roy, a BCE senior vice president, said that based on
the current stock price TelMex is worth about $7 billion,
giving the 20.4% stake an indicated value of about $1.4
billion.
   Mr. Roy wouldn't say if the joint venture expects to offer
a premium for the control block. The Mexican government
currently holds about 56% of TelMex while the remainder is
publicly held.
   BCE and Nynex will each own about 25% of the venture and
Casa de Bolsa Inverlat Associates, a Mexican financial
concern, will own at least 50.1%. Mr. Roy said the partners
are still working on the details of their bid, which must
include a detailed operating plan for TelMex.
   Under rules established by the Mexican government, groups
making bids must be at least 50.1%-owned by Mexican investors
and must include at least one foreign telephone company. The
bidding process is only open to concerns approved by the
government. Four Mexican groups (a fifth dropped out) and 12
foreign telephone concerns have been accepted as possible
bidders by the government, Mr. Roy said.
   The bidding deadline is Nov. 15 and the government expects
to make a decision by the end of the year, Mr. Roy said.
   The winning bidder faces a massive job modernizing TelMex,
Mr. Roy said. But for BCE and Nynex the Mexican telephone
monopoly also represents a "tremendous opportunity." He said
there is the potential for "double-digit annual growth" at
TelMex. He said the telephone monopoly only has about five
million telephone lines in operation now and the Mexican
economy could support twice that number.
   Mr. Roy said the Mexican government has guaranteed TelMex
a monoply on basic phone service until 1996. He said the
telephone monopoly is profitable and has annual revenue of
about $5 billion.
   BCE, parent of Bell Canada, is a Montreal-based holding
company. Nynex is the New York-based Baby Bell. Inverlat is
based in Mexico City. The joint venture's announcement was
made after the market closed yesterday.

equipment maker, reported that first-half consolidated pretax
profit fell 41% to 60.9 billion lire ($51.9 million) from
102.6 billion lire a year earlier, continuing a 3 1/2-year
earnings slide.
   Operating profit fell 35% to 102.1 billion lire from 156.4
billion lire.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue rose 5.8% to 4.167 trillion lire from 3.938
trillion lire.
   Carlo De Benedetti, chairman and the controlling
shareholder, blamed the earnings drop on tough market
conditions, a continuing squeeze in profit margins and an
unfavorable exchange rate for the lira. But the company
claimed it fared much better than most of its European and
U.S. competitors, and predicted it will continue to outpace
other computer makers for the rest of the year, though it
didn't give a specific earnings forecast.

   Platinum's Decline Deepens as October Contract
   Falls $10.70; Loss Since Aug. 21 Stands at 15%

   NEW YORK -- The slide in platinum prices accelerated into
a plunge, as they dropped for the fourth consecutive session.
Silver and gold also declined.
   Platinum for October delivery fell $10.70 an ounce to
$437.30, the lowest level since July 14, 1986, when the July
contract traded at $435.30. Since Aug. 21, when October
traded at $514.00, its price has fallen 15%, or $76.70 an
ounce.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts have pointed out that platinum, like silver and
palladium, is actually more an industrial metal than a
precious one. The price reflects a world-wide economic
slowdown, particularly in the automobile industry, where
platinum is used in catalytic converters to reduce pollution
from auto emissions.
   South Africa, which produces about 85% of the world's
platinum, and the Soviet Union, which accounts for about 10%,
have been reported to be selling. Also pressuring prices,
analysts say, is that consumption is easing while production
is increasing.
   According to Nina Lipton, research manager for the
Platinum Guild International, an industry group, traders and
analysts have been looking far and wide to account for the
price plunge.
   "Yes, there has been a technical breakdown in the charts,"
she said, "but some of the fundamentals people are citing
aren't necessarily valid."
   For example, she said, auto production overall is going
up, not down: "Automobile companies around the world are
producing more cars this year than last. U.S. auto makers
recently reported that they expect to turn out 9.6% more cars
in the fourth quarter than last year."
   In addition, she said, catalytic converters are becoming
more widespread -- Brazil and Mexico will begin equipping new
cars with them next year -- and regulations both in the U.S.
and elsewhere are becoming more stringent, calling for more
platinum in each converter.
   Analysts and traders are on firmer ground when they note
an absence of Japanese demand for platinum, she said.
Japanese investors are a pivotal factor in platinum -- it's
their favorite metal for jewelry -- but they have other
things on their minds now, she said.
   "Their stock market is down, their interest rates are
rising, and they're concerned about the cost of oil because
they import 99% of their oil," Ms. Lipton said. "The Japanese
understand and like to invest in platinum, but at the moment
they're neither buying nor selling it."
   There have been Japanese offerings of platinum, Ms. Lipton
said, "but there is some question if they are on behalf of
Japanese sellers. It is thought more likely that the business
is being done for the Soviet Union."
   Ms. Lipton acknowledged that many analysts and traders
have long expected the price of platinum to boom because of
the world's heavy dependence on South Africa for supplies.
The turbulent political situation in that country has been
expected to affect production.
   "First of all, there have been no reports that the tribal
violence has affected mine production," she said. "If that
were to happen, there would be a sound basis for that belief.
Secondly, the world is now focused on the Middle East, and
South African news has been shoved aside, so the current
violence isn't having the psychological impact that it could
have had, say, a couple of months ago."
   The sharp price decline is also causing potential buyers
to stand aside, as they wait to see when the market will
bottom out, she said. And there is a widespread desire at
present not to invest in any kind of market -- stocks,
precious metals or any other -- and to hold cash, she said.
   "It will become clear soon enough that, when the platinum
price bottoms out, it will be cheap in relation to its
underlying fundamentals," Ms. Lipton said.
   Recession fears caused by the rise in oil prices depressed
platinum, said Ian MacDonald, a vice president of Credit
Suisse in New York. "If there is a recession, the auto
industry is the first one that's going to be hit, and that's
on people's minds. The recession won't be good for silver,
either. The spread between that metal and gold is widening."
   December delivery gold ended with a $2 loss at $410.80 an
ounce. December silver was down 2.8 cents an ounce to
$4.8450.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices rose yesterday
and are expected to open still higher this morning as a
result of a crop report showing smaller-than-expected soybean
stockpiles carried over from the 1989-90 crop year. The
Agriculture Department said that as of Sept. 1, soybean
stockpiles from last season's crop totaled 239 million
bushels, which was 11 million to 13 million fewer than many
analysts had expected. Continued uncertainty in the Persian
Gulf and the risk that high oil prices will stoke an
inflationary fire in other commodities, also are supporting
soybean futures, said Steven Freed, a futures analyst with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. Yesterday, soybean
futures for November delivery gained 3.75 cents a bushel to
close at $6.1925. Prices were supported by rumors that the
Soviet Union had purchased soybean meal from Argentina,
analysts said. Wheat futures may also gain this morning after
the release of a smaller-than-expected stockpile figure. The
government said wheat stockpiles as of Sept. 1 were 2.4
billion bushels, compared with analyst expectations of about
2.47 billion bushels, said Richard Loewy, president of
AgResource Co. in Chicago. The lower figure reflected the
increased use of wheat as livestock feed during the summer,
Mr. Loewy said. December wheat futures gained one cent a
bushel yesterday to close at $2.775. Corn stockpiles totaled
1.34 billion bushels, roughly in line with market
expectations. December corn futures slipped 0.75 cent a
bushel to close at $2.275.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices rose, mostly reflecting tightness
of immediately available supplies, analysts said. The October
contract was up 2.65 cents a pound to $1.2755. The most
active contract, December, advanced 2.25 cents to $1.1985.
But overall, the world's supply and demand are about in
balance, with a tilt to the bearish side, Fred Demler, metals
economist at Paine Webber, said. World-wide consumption is
weaker, and supplies have risen, Mr. Demler said. The drop in
usage has been particularly notable in the U.S., he said,
where it fell 13% in August from July. Global deliveries of
copper as of the end of July were down 12% from a year
earlier, he said. This more than offset a 7% drop in world
output in July from a year earlier, he said.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices were easier. The October contract,
which ceases trading today, ended with a loss of 0.30 cent a
pound at 10.52 cents. The March contract showed a loss of
only 0.04 cent a pound at 10.54 cents. A private report that
projected a rise in global output of sugar caused selling in
both contracts, but the greater pressure in the October
delivery came from producers who sold contracts to fix prices
for their sugar, according to a dealer. F.O. Licht, the West
German sugar statistical firm, in its first estimate of the
1990-91 world sugar harvest, placed output at 111.5 million
metric tons, or 2.8 million tons more than in the 1989-90
season. A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds.

   Davis Offers Help

   Unions to Buy Carrier

   CHICAGO -- Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis offered to
help United Airlines' unions acquire the carrier if the
employees' current offer for United parent UAL Corp. fails.
   Gerald Greenwald, who is leading the employee buy-out
effort, rejected Mr. Davis's offer for now, saying the labor
group expects to complete the buy-out on its own. "We do not
expect any action will be taken" on the Davis offer, Mr.
Greenwald said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The buy-out group said it received an unsolicited letter
from Mr. Davis, dated Wednesday, in which he offered to
provide as much as $750 million in equity for a joint bid.
Mr. Davis proposed giving the employees a 20% interest in
UAL, with the right to buy out his position after two years.
   Mr. Davis didn't specify a purchase price, but said he
would be willing to negotiate one with UAL's board.
   It is unlikely UAL's unions would want to work with Mr.
Davis, even if their offer fails. United's pilots union
refused to join him in a bid last year because he insisted on
majority control of the company. The unions have continued to
discourage other potential equity investors who sought
control as the price of their involvement.
   By raising the possiblity that Mr. Davis might return, the
unions may be trying to shore up support for the employee
effort within their own ranks. Earlier this week, the pilots
union accused UAL management and chairman Stephen M. Wolf of
trying to foment dissent.
   Indeed, in their latest letter to UAL pilots, union
leaders warned that "raiders remain a threat" and
specifically singled out Mr. Davis. "Only employee
ownership," the union cautioned, "would end the threat of
raiders."
   UAL's three principal unions are working on an offer of
$175 a share for 85% of UAL's stock after failing to obtain
financing for the $201-a-share, $4.38 billion offer the board
accepted last April. Some traders value the latest offer at
only about $160 a share, or $3.49 billion.
   The unions have until Oct. 9 to present the board with a
financed offer. It is still unclear whether the board will
accept a lower bid or whether this bid can gain bank
financing. Mr. Davis said his offer of help stands if the
unions fail to get the financing, or if the board rejects
their latest offer.

merger agreement.
   The amended agreement would change the share exchange
ratio in the stock swap merger so that Louisiana General
shareholders would receive from 0.6719 to 0.8 share of
Citizens Utilities common Series B for each Louisiana General
common share held.
</LP>

   The exchange was originally set at 0.6719 share. The
actual figure will depend on the average share price of
Citizens shares during a period prior to the merger.
   The amendment to the merger agreement is subject to
approval by the shareholders of both companies. Citizens is a
public utility, providing telecommunications, electric, gas
and water services in 12 states. Louisiana General is
primarily involved in residential and commercial gas
operations and industrial gas operations in Louisiana.

   SAN DIEGO -- A federal court jury awarded Brooktree Corp.
$26 million in damages for infringements Advanced Micro
Devices made on the tiny chip maker's patents and copyrights.
   The award comes two weeks after the U.S. District Court
ruled that Advanced Micro, a Sunnyvale, Calif., chip maker,
illegally used three Brooktree patents in computer chips
called "color palettes," which control the display of colors
on computer screens. The court also ruled that Advanced Micro
infringed on Brooktree "mask work" rights, the rights to
circuit layouts on chips.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The award is a big one for Brooktree, a private company
that expects revenue of just over $60 million this year.
Brooktree charged that offending Advanced Micro chips cut
deeply into the smaller company's revenue. Advanced Micro's
color palette chips comprised less than 1% of its $1.1
billion revenue in 1989.
   An Advanced Micro spokesman said the company will appeal
the damage award as well as the ruling. "This a shocking and
unsupportable amount of damages," the spokesman said. He
added Advanced Micro didn't copy Brooktree's chips and that
patent violation, if there was any, was inadvertent because
Advanced Micro's product was on the market before the patents
were issued.
   The federal judge in the case issued an injunction calling
for Advanced Micro to stop making, using or selling any
infringing products. The court stayed the injunction for 10
days, but Advanced Micro says it will comply by immediately
ceasing sales of the product in question.
   Advanced Micro has a patent-infringement case pending
against Brooktree, and says its patents are broader than
Brooktree's.

   Bank of Boston Reduces Its Dividend
   And Plans to Trim Work Force by 8%

   BOSTON -- Bank of Boston Corp., struggling in the sinking
New England ecomony, cut its dividend for the first time in
at least 30 years.
   The bank, plagued by a huge portfolio of nonperforming
assets, said that it will add about $175 million to its loan
loss reserves to offset continuing problems in the soft New
England real estate market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The third-quarter numbers, according to bank officials,
will be bleak: it will lose up to $250 million. In the
year-earlier quarter, the company had a loss of $125 million.
In the next few months, 1,500 employees, 8% of the bank's
work force, are expected to leave under a voluntary program
of severance enhancements. The dividend, which the bank
claims is the longest standing in North America, continuously
paid since 1785, will drop from 31 cents a share to a dime.
   "This corporation is clearly in a position to absorb these
kinds of problems -- even if they continue for a while," said
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ira Stepanian. He added
that the bank's actions yesterday, especially in terms of
increasing loan loss reserves, "ought to give people a sense
of comfort. Will it? Probably not."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bank of Boston shares closed at $7.125, down 37.5 cents.
   The crux of the bank's problems are in its portfolio of
nonperforming assets. The bank's reduction of nonperforming
assets by $100 million to $1.85 billion was due to
charge-offs of about $175 million in bad loans and another
$35 million in real estate now owned by the bank. Chief
Financial Officer Peter Manning says that the inflow of fresh
nonperformers has been slowing a bit, although it is still in
the hundreds of millions for the quarter.
   "Their nonperforming asset total has been kept level, but
at a painful level," said James Moynihan, an analyst with
Advest Inc. "When you realize the cost of those
nonperformers, in legal fees, much less the interest you must
still pay to depositers for holding their money, it's just
astounding." Carrying nonperformers costs the bank about $180
million annually.
   The bank has also put aside $50 million in restructuring
costs, most of which will be paid in severance packages to
the 1,500 employees slated to leave by early 1991. Bank
officials said those employed for at least 10 years will be
offered the severance package, though it won't be extended to
senior management.
   The bank said the moves it is making will reduce its
noninterest expense level by at least $100 million annually.
   "These are very disturbing numbers, not just for Bank of
Boston but for all banks in the country with an exposure in
commerical real estate," said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with
Tucker, Anthony &amp; R.L. Day in Portland, Maine. "It shows bad
loans are still flowing in the front door -- that we haven't
hit bottom yet. To keep things under control, the bank will
have to continue to eat into its capital position."
   Richard Syron, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston, said recently that the region's economic slide is
still a year away from hitting bottom. The concern among
bankers in New England is that another year of high real
estate exposure, weak earnings and deteriorating credit
quality will eat away at the capital that serves as a bank's
financial cushion.
   On that score, the Bank of Boston, the region's largest
bank with $37 billion in assets, has few worries. Its capital
level is strong, at over 9% of total assets.

   Teradata Corp. said it sees a fiscal first-quarter loss of
between 40 cents a share and 50 cents a share on
lower-than-expected revenue of about $50 million.
   In the year-ago quarter, the Los Angeles computer systems
concern earned $2.4 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue
of $43 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Teradata said it is "taking a number of actions to
significantly reduce operating expense levels in anticipation
of lower-than-expected revenue growth" for the fiscal year
ending June 30. Some of these actions will result in a
"modest" first-quarter charge, the company said.
   "We intend to reduce our operating expenses . . .
sufficiently to provide year-over-year earnings growth" in
fiscal year 1991, Teradata said. This year, the company had
net income of $16.3 million, or $1.15 a share.
   Teradata attributed the revenue shortfall to slow sales in
Germany and Europe, including postponement of purchases by a
large European customer. The company said orders had been
disappointing from bank customers, particularly in the
Northeast.

Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. plan to meet late next
week to begin negotiating the possible $7.3 billion to $8.7
billion acquisition of the U.S. entertainment company, people
close to the situation say.
   The two sides haven't had formal talks before, and
accounts vary on how much work awaits them. Sources on the
Matsushita side stress that talks to date have been
preliminary; sources in the MCA camp say the parameters have
already been established by go-between Michael Ovitz,
chairman of Creative Artists, a talent agency, who is
representing Matsushita.

<TEXT>
   Separately, it was learned that MCA Music Entertainment
Group has agreed to form a joint venture with Victor Co. of
Japan Ltd., 51%-owned by Matsushita, to market and distribute
all MCA records as well as its Geffen and GRP labels in
Japan. Al Teller, chairman of MCA Music, wouldn't comment,
but he is said to have been working on the deal -- and
another distribution agreement with West German media concern
Bertelsmann AG -- months before initial discussions began
between MCA and Matsushita.
   In the MCA-Matsushita talks, which may begin as late as
next Sunday, numerous issues have yet to be worked out.
According to sources close to MCA, the basic terms of the
arrangement -- that management will remain in place and that
the price will be from $80-$95 a share for all of the
approximately 91.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding
-- have been worked out. But advisers at the Japanese
consumer electronics concern are expected to recommend a
lower price, closer to $60 to $70 a share.
   Likely participants in the talks will be representatives
from the two companies, plus, for Matsushita: Mr. Ovitz;
Herbert Allen of the investment advisory firm of Allen & Co.;
the law firm of Simpson, Thacher &amp; Bartlett; and a major
investment bank -- possibly Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. -- which is
being retained.
   MCA will be represented by Felix Rohatyn of Lazard Freres
& Co.; Martin Lipton of the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton,
Rosen & Katz; and Robert Strauss of the Washington law firm
of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld. Mr. Strauss and Mr.
Rohatyn are MCA directors, and Mr. Strauss is said to have
played a key role in preliminary talks.
   None of the advisers would comment on the talks. Mr. Allen
and Mr. Ovitz worked together on last year's Sony Corp.
acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment. Mr. Ovitz had
negotiated with Sony to head Columbia, but talks broke down.
Hollywood speculates that Mr. Ovitz wants a role in MCA, but
people close to MCA and Creative Artists deny any immediate
plan for him to run the company.
   One key issue of the negotiations is said to be
tax-related. MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman, 77 years old, and
the estate of the company's late founder Jules Stein, along
with various charitable trusts which Mr. Wasserman controls,
hold about 12% of MCA stock at an extremely low cost basis.
Capital gains and estate taxes could be extensive if the
acquisition takes place.
   Individuals close to the situation say negotiators would
seek an arrangement under which this tax bite could be
deferred, perhaps through some non-cash component or other
mechanism -- such as a premium or specially -- created
security. The remaining shareholders would be paid in cash.
This could complicate the acquisition structure, but tax
experts say a solution probably could be found.
   The meeting was originally planned for this weekend. But
the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur, and the fact that a key
Matsushita player reportedly would have had to return to
Japan by Wednesday, postponed the plan. In addition,
"Everybody just needed more time to get all the numbers
together," one source said.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday MCA
stock closed at $59 a share, down $2.25 a share, buffeted by
conflicting reports of the meeting schedule.
   The MCA-Victor Co. music pact is designed to solve a
strategic weakness for MCA: It lacks international
distribution for its music outside the U.S., Canada and the
U.K. Instead, it contracts with a unit of Time Warner Inc.
for distribution. MCA wants its own piece of this growing $20
billion business and wants to develop its own roster of
overseas artists.
   MCA and Geffen's agreements with Time Warner expire in
April and January, respectively. Mr. Teller wouldn't comment
on either agreement, but it's known that since MCA acquired
Geffen Records for 10 million shares of MCA stock in March,
Mr. Teller has been pursuing new distribution agreements. A
Victor Co. spokesman was unavailable for comment.
   Separately, shareholder suits seeking class action status
have been filed in Delaware Chancery Court and in Los Angeles
Superior Court, charging MCA with denying shareholders the
chance to get a higher price for their shares by spurning
other suitors, negotiating preferentially with Matsushita,
seeking to preserve MCA management and entering talks when
the shares were trading at the comparatively low price of
$34. MCA didn't comment on the suits.

   NEW YORK -- Worried traders scrambled to sell bonds of
major banks and other financial issues as concern grew about
the fragility of the financial system.
   The search for safety drove many traders and investors to
government-guaranteed securities, sending prices sharply
higher on Treasury bills, notes and bonds. Prices of
long-term Treasury bonds surged yesterday by about one point,
or $10 for each $1,000 face amount.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "New cash that investors and money managers have is going
into Treasurys," said William Brachfeld, executive vice
president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. "There's wholesale
dumping by institutions of common stocks and debt of banks
and financial institutions because they don't want them on
their books at quarter's end, with the massive declines we've
seen in prices lately. And the beneficiary of this is the
Treasury market."
   Treasury bond prices also were bolstered by speculation
that congressional leaders and the White House are close to
an agreement on cutting the nation's budget deficit, traders
said. If so, the Federal Reserve may react soon by lowering
short-term interest rates. The Fed's policymaking committee
is scheduled to meet Tuesday to review credit strategy.
   Corporate junk bonds took another pounding. Prices of many
bellwether junk bonds, those high-risk, high-yield issues of
companies with low credit ratings or no ratings at all,
tumbled by about one point, their sixth consecutive setback.
   In the municipal bond market, Massachusetts is paying a
stiff price for its financial woes. Massachusetts, which has
the lowest bond rating of any state, had to offer investors
high yields -- ranging to nearly 8% on some seven-year bonds
-- to attract buyers for a $1.3 billion issue.
   Some municipal-finance specialists thought Massachusetts
might have to pay an even stiffer price for its financial
problems. Worries about the state's finances are widespread
because of speculation that voters may approve a proposed
tax-cut initiative in November. Bond dealers said the yields
announced yesterday were high enough to attract a mixed
reception from investors.
   In the corporate sector, Chase Manhattan Corp., NCNB Corp.
and Bankers Trust New York Corp. were among the hardest hit.
Bank bonds have been hammered recently in the aftermath of
Chase's decision to cut its dividend and slash its staff by
5,000.
   Some traders say investors have overreacted, that bank
bonds now offer unusually attractive yields and that this
could be a good time to pick up bargains. But they also say
there's no rush.
   "This probably is not the right time" to buy bank bonds,
said Neil Crowder, investment analyst at IDS Financial
Services Inc. in Minneapolis. "The bonds do look cheap, but
there's a good chance they will get even cheaper soon. My
sense is there are so many people who want to get out of them
right now that buying would be almost like stepping in front
of a freight train."
   The bank bond market "is very thin, and a lot of names are
being hurt," said Richard Barnett, a corporate bond analyst
at Mabon Nugent &amp; Co. "The buyers are few and far between,
and there are very few bids left in the Street."
   While banking and financial-sector issues continue to be
punished, traders say investor skittishness has spread to
other sectors, forcing yields higher on long-term bonds of
high-rated industrial corporations.
   "Customers look at the marketplace and perceive heightened
corporate credit risk in a recessionary environment," said
James Quigley, head of syndicate at Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury securities were star performers amid growing
worries about the banking system.
   The benchmark 30-year bonds jumped to 97 6/32 from 96 5/32
Wednesday. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction
to prices, fell to 9.01% from 9.13%.
   Short-term Treasury bills, known as the safest and
stodgiest investments, also are enjoying growing popularity.
Prices rose again yesterday, and yields fell. The
bond-equivalent yield on the latest six-month bill fell to
7.55%, down about 0.15 percentage point from Wednesday. The
discount rate on these bills ended at 7.20% bid.
   The Treasury's new two-year notes, auctioned Tuesday by
the government at an average annual yield of 8.18%, were
quoted late yesterday at 8.02%. The new four-year notes, sold
Wednesday at an average yield of 8.53%, were quoted at 8.40%.
   Rumors that budget negotiators in Washington were close to
an accord helped drive Treasurys, traders said, though many
of them remained skeptical.
   "The old saw is `Buy the rumor, sell the fact,'" said Joel
Naroff, senior economist at First Fidelity Bank in
Philadelphia. "That's what people are doing" in buying
government bonds despite the absence of concrete results in
the budget process, he said.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   The huge Massachusetts issue occupied center stage in the
tax-free market.
   The state offered yields ranging as high as 7.97% for
bonds due in 1997, a reflection of its financial troubles. By
contrast, Maryland, which has a triple-A rating, sold
seven-year bonds this week at a yield about 1.5 percentage
points below that on comparable Massachusetts securities.
   Massachusetts paid a rate for the term bonds comparable
with those on bonds sold by issuers such as New York City,
whose finances also are making many investors increasingly
nervous.
   Analysts said the $1.3 billion Massachusetts issue
appeared get a mixed reception from investors.
   Underwriters were able to restructure the issue late in
the day to lower the yield on the bonds maturing in 1997 to
7.97% from the 8% tentatively set earlier. But Massachusetts
also changed the composition of the issue -- moving bonds
from the longest maturity in 1997 to shorter maturities --
because of what some analysts said were difficulties in
selling many of the seven-year bonds.
   The Massachusetts issue also includes bonds secured by
letters of credit.
   Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets said
they were pleased with investor reaction. "Very successful,"
said Dennis Boyle, a managing director at Merrill.
   Some investment managers decided against buying the new
bonds partly because Massachusetts faces the possibility of
further revenue reductions if a voter initiative to reduce
taxes sharply passes in November. If so, Massachusetts bonds
could come under additional pressure.
   "Proceeds of these bonds will clear the commonwealth's
$1.3 billion accumulated deficit, but it is too soon to
assess the effect of efforts to restore financial control,"
cautioned Moody's Investors Service Inc. In a statement
yesterday, the rating concern warned: "Continuing threats to
fiscal stability are posed by economic weakening, which has
already produced lowerings of this year's revenue estimates,
a pending court challenge to part of the fiscal 1991 tax
package and the tax-cut petition to be voted in November."
   Meanwhile, prices of other state and local government
bonds trading in the secondary, or resale, market ended
little changed or with moderate gains. The New Jersey
Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due in 2018 rose 1/2 to 96
1/4 bid, 96 1/2 offered, to yield 7.50%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate &amp; Junk Bonds

   The corporate bond market, battered by heavy selling in
banking and financial issues, experienced broad declines as
investors scrambled to sell bonds amid rising concerns about
a weakening economy.
   Corporate junk bond prices also tumbled. Salomon Brothers
Inc.'s daily high-yield index showed a price decline for the
sixth day in a row and the 12th time in 13 trading days.
   Among corporate issues most affected were those of
Marriott Corp. and Unisys. Unisys said it would suspend its
25-cent quarterly dividend on its common, and Marriott
reported sharply lower third-quarter earnings.
   Yields on some bonds of the two companies jumped about
half a percentage point. Unisys 10 3/4% debentures due in
1995 finished the day at 13.50%, up from 13% late Wednesday,
and Marriott's 8 7/8% senior notes due in 1997 also ended at
13.50%, up from 13%.
   Meanwhile, the already bruised bank sector continued to
deteriorate amid further signs of difficulties at large
banks. Traders said bonds from such companies as Bankers
Trust New York and NCNB came under pressure. Also hurt were
the already deeply depressed bonds of Chase Manhattan.
   Chase's 10% subordinated notes due in 1999 fell two points
to 74 1/8. Bankers Trust New York's 9.50% subordinated notes,
maturing in 2000, dropped 1 5/8 to 90 5/8 for a yield of
11.10%. NCNB Texas National Bank's subordinated capital notes
due in 2004 plunged 4 3/4 to 86 3/8 for a yield of 11.60%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage &amp; Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-backed securities were higher despite the
continued increase in oil prices.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities
for October delivery were up 15/32 at 98 5/32. Conventional
mortgages were up 12/32, with Federal National Mortgage
Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. gold 9 1/2%
certificates for October delivery at 98 12/32 and 98 18/32,
respectively.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, November crude oil
futures reached a record of $40.10 a barrel around midday and
closed at $39.54, up 87 cents a barrel.
   Despite the sharp increase in the oil market, the
fixed-income markets have shown new signs of life. Traders
cited optimism about a solution to the budget deficit and the
prospect of an impending easing in interest rates by the Fed
as possible reasons, as well as the collapse in the banking
and finance sectors of the corporate bond market.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British and German government bond prices finished little
changed, while Japanese bonds inched higher.
   In Tokyo, traders were encouraged by the U.S. decision to
sell five million barrels of oil from its Strategic Petroleum
Reserve to try to contain surging oil prices. Japan's
benchmark issue No. 119, the 4.8% bonds due 1999, rose on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange to 80.68 from 80.63 Wednesday. The yield
fell to 8.69% from 8.71%.
   In London, traders said investors remain worried about
inflation and are moving money into shorter-term securities,
which offer exceptionally high yields. Some short-term U.K.
issues now yield more than 14 1/4%.
   Britain's 11 3/4% issue due 1991 rose 1/32 to 99 5/32 to
yield 14.27%. Among long-term issues, the 11 3/4% bonds due
2003/2007 finished unchanged at 99 2/32 to yield 11.87%.

   TORONTO -- Canadian Express Ltd. said Hees International
Bancorp, a merchant banking concern controlled by Toronto's
Bronfman family, and the Toronto Stock Exchange agreed to
extend to Oct. 18 the deadline on Hees's bid to acquire as
many as 40 million Canadian Express shares for as much as 26
million Canadian dollars (U.S.$22.5 million).
   The offer of 65 Canadian cents (56 U.S. cents) a share was
to be made next Wednesday. The bid would raise Hees's voting
stake in the Toronto banking company to about 56% from 40%.
Canadian Express said it asked for the extension to allow
time for the completion of a fairness opinion.

   If the budget summit is settling on indexation of the base
for capital gains, it's also time to look seriously at
deductibility of capital losses. For starters, here are some
reasons:
   Equity. While the system adds gains to ordinary income and
taxes it all, it allows the deduction from ordinary income of
only $3,000 of a loss.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Economic vitality. Indexing of its nature affects
filed-away investments. Loss deductibility of its nature
would occur quickly most of the time, freeing capital to move
on to better uses. It would help high-risk, high-reward
investments. Don't ask "the rich" about that; ask an
electronics or biotech entrepreneur.
   Whether George Mitchell likes it or not, investments have
something to do with America's health. Some go up, some down.
A budget summit that both indexed gains and allowed
deductibility of losses would reassure the country that
Washington still wants it to grow.

   A federal judge in Florida struck down as unconstitutional
a rule by the state's board of accountancy that restricted
certified public accountants from directly soliciting new
business.
   In his ruling, Judge Maurice M. Paul found the state's
administrative code "places an unconstitutional ban on
protected commercial speech in violation of the first and
fourteenth amendments."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The case was brought by Scott Fane, a CPA licensed to
practice in Florida, against the state board, which the
Legislature has empowered to promulgate rules for the
profession. An attorney in the Florida attorney general's
office, which defended the case, said a decision hasn't been
made whether to appeal.
   The state argued that its prohibition of accountants
soliciting business in person, or by telephone, was similar
to restrictions on attorney solicitation recently upheld by
the U.S. Supreme Court. But the judge held that concerns
surrounding solicitation by attorneys were unique to that
profession, and couldn't be extended to accountants.
   David Vladeck, an attorney with the Public Citizen
litigation group in Washington who represented Mr. Fane, said
he doesn't know whether his client has begun exercising his
right to drum up business. Mr. Fane, a tax specialist,
"believes it will be much more efficient for him" to be able
to call potential clients and offer his services, Mr. Vladeck
said.

   Yen Loses Ground as Oil Prices Climb,
   Tokyo Stock Market Continues to Slide

   NEW YORK -- Rising world oil prices and the retreating
Tokyo stock market pushed the yen lower against all major
currencies. The dollar gained at the expense of the weakened
Japanese currency but fell against others.
   The greenback's mixed performance resulted from the
dominance of cross, or non-dollar, trading. Except when the
occasional rumor of war in the Mideast focused attention to
the dollar (which is believed to be a haven for investors in
times of turmoil), direct mark-yen trading offered the
liveliest action.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dollar is used as a medium for 95% of cross
transactions in the U.S. and for 90% in Europe. It rises
against the currency that's being sold -- in this case, the
yen -- and falls against the currencies being bought -- here,
the European currencies.
   In late New York trading, the greenback was quoted at
1.5612 marks and 1.2925 Swiss francs, down from 1.5650 marks
and 1.3015 francs late Wednesday in New York. The U.S.
currency was also changing hands at 138 yen, up from 136.84
yen. Sterling was trading at $1.8773, up from $1.8727.
   The mark was quoted at 88.394 yen, up from 87.438 yen late
Wednesday in New York. In another active cross market, the
Swiss franc rose to 106.770 yen from 105.140 yen.
   In Tokyo early Friday, the dollar was trading at 137.95
yen, up from the 137.50 yen close there on Thursday.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5620
marks, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.5673 marks.
   Contributing to the yen's decline, prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange fell again Thursday. The Nikkei index of 225
stocks dropped 2.15% to 21771.91, after shedding 4.75%
Wednesday. Brokers attributed Thursday's losses to selling,
to meet margin requirements, by investors squeezed by
Wednesday's big drop.
   Oil prices continued to rise as heightened fears of war in
the Persian Gulf won the day over the U.S. decision to tap
its Strategic Petroleum Reserve on a test basis. A decision
could be made to draw down the reserve to boost oil supplies
and curb price rises.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the benchmark crude
oil contract for November delivery briefly rose above $40 a
barrel before ending at $39.54 a barrel, up 87 cents.
   Meanwhile, rumors spread that U.S. troops had entered
either Kuwait or Iraq, although a U.S. Defense Department
spokesman denied them.
   But the rumblings about the Middle East caused no more
than short-lived blips in currency prices because dealers say
everything short of war has been priced into the market. News
and rumors did affect the tone of trading, leaving it
occasionally volatile but ultimately directionless.
   "The market is very, very nervous," said Joseph Cambria,
New York foreign exchange manager for Banque Paribas. "You're
seeing gaps {in pricing}. The market is starting to warm up,
because people are starting to see there is a resolution
coming and that will probably be war. Things are becoming
fairly bitter."
   Mr. Cambria noted, for example, responses by U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker and the British Foreign Office
to a note Iraq sent to embassies in Kuwait. The note asked
for the names of non-diplomats inside and implied that
Westerners sheltering those persons could be hanged.
   Mr. Baker called the note "repugnant" and a British
statement said the request put to rest Iraq's "pretensions"
as a civilized state.
   A Singapore dealer said, "The Gulf crisis makes a rational
approach to the market very difficult."
   The dollar ended European dealings mostly weaker. The
unwinding of some long, or overbought, dollar positions kept
the currency on the defensive most of the day, although
prices stayed in extremely narrow ranges throughout the
session.
   The greenback finished Asian trading mostly higher, after
covering of short, or oversold, positions boosted it against
the yen early in the quiet session. The dollar was last
quoted in Tokyo Thursday at 137.50 yen, just above 137.40 yen

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Striking a blow to advocates of
voter-mandated insurance-rate cuts, a federal court here
declared unconstitutional a Nevada law requiring sweeping
auto-insurance rate roll backs.
   The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Nevada
law denied insurers a constitutionally guaranteed "fair and
reasonable return." The Nevada reform package, passed in 1989
to mirror California's similar Proposition 103, called for
insurers to cut auto liability insurance rates to a minimum
of 15% below 1988 levels and to freeze rates for a year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Seven insurance companies challenged the law, maintaining
that it violated their due process rights because it
prohibited their increasing rates if they faced losses.
Nevada's new restrictions, which were to have taken effect
Oct. 1, 1989, weren't enforced because the court imposed
stays while legal challenges were pending.
   Nevada's law states "rates are inadequate if they are
clearly insufficient, together with the income from
investments attributable to them, to sustain projected losses
and expenses in the class of business to which they apply."
   The federal court yesterday ruled that the definition left
insurers in the position of declaring rates adequate if
losses and expenses were identical.

   KUWAIT'S EMIR ADDRESSED the U.N., decrying "terror"
inflicted by Iraq.
   Sheik Jaber's appeal for a withdrawal of Baghdad's troops
drew a standing ovation as Iraq tightened its grip on the
emirate by ordering Kuwaiti nationals to apply for Iraqi
citizenship. Western governments, meanwhile, expressed
outrage at an Iraqi threat to execute diplomats who shelter
foreigners, but Baghdad said the warning was aimed at its own
citizens. In the Red Sea, a U.S. Navy frigate fired shots
across the bow of an Iraqi tanker. The tanker was released
after the Navy searched the vessel. Despite a U.N. air
embargo against Baghdad, three Iraqi Airways flights arrived

   NEW YORK -- In the latest sign of Wall Street's rush to
profit from companies in financial distress, Goldman Sachs &amp;
Co. said it finished raising a $750 million fund that will
invest in troubled corporations.
   Goldman's fund is the second biggest of more than 20
"restructuring" or "turnaround" investment pools being raised
this year, according to pension consultants. The Goldman
fund, known as Water Street Recovery Fund I, is exceeded in
size only by a $1 billion pool raised earlier this year by
Chicago investors Samuel Zell and David Schulte.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Goldman figures there is plenty of money to be made from
turnaround investing. In the four years prior to setting up
the Water Street fund, the firm says it made 22 investments
of its own in distressed companies' bonds, bank debt or
equity, usually at cut-rate prices. Eleven of those
investments produced annual returns of 35% or better, says
Goldman partner Mikael Salovaara. Mr. Salovaara is managing
the new fund.
   In a memo to investors, the Water Street fund states that
it is seeking annual returns of 25% to 35%. If that goal is
achieved, Goldman will benefit richly. Goldman has $100
million of its own money in the fund; it also is entitled to
as much as 20% of the profits earned by its other investors,
which include corporate pension funds, university endowments
and foreign banks, mostly Japanese.

   Expects to Post
   Strong Profits

   But 3rd-Quarter Numbers
   Won't Necessarily Mean
   Robust Performances

   While most of corporate America is bracing for gloomy
third-quarter results, the phone industry is looking to ring
up solid profits.
   "Relative to the rest of the world," says Jack B. Grubman,
a telecommunications analyst with PaineWebber Inc., phone
company earnings "will look really good."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The phone industry's numbers, however, don't necessarily
reflect a robust performance. Profits in the year-earlier
quarter were depressed by one-time charges, labor-settlement
costs and new state regulatory structures that required
initial rate cuts.
   Analysts anticipate earnings for the regional Bell
companies to rise 6% to 14%, with the exception of BellSouth
Corp. The outlook for the long-distance companies isn't so
favorable.
   MCI Communications Corp.'s earnings will be diluted by the
company's $1.25 billion acquisition of Telecom USA and damped
by a higher tax rate. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
continues to be hurt by start-up costs associated with its
credit card business. United Telecommunications Inc., the
Kansas City-based owner of US Sprint long-distance service,
is still recovering from a $72 million charge in the second
quarter related to a $42 million operating loss at Sprint.
   Analysts anticipate MCI will post profits of 65 cents a
share, up 4% from 62 cents a share, or $165 million, in the
year-earlier period. Robert B. Morris III, a
telecommunications analyst with Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. said MCI
will be hurt by higher taxes in addition to dilution. Last
year, MCI's tax rate was 28%, compared with the current 33%
level. "That's about a nickel a share," says Mr. Morris.
   For United Telecom, analyst foresee quarterly earnings
slumping about 11%. Earnings are projected at 40 cents a
share, compared with 45 cents a share a year earlier, when
the company earned $94.6 million. AT&amp;T's profits are
anticipated to be about 66 cents a share, up a modest 2% from
65 cents a share, or $699 million, in the year-earlier
quarter.
   Analysts expect minutes-of-use for the long-distance
segment to grow between 9% and 10%.
   For the regional Bell companies, U S West Inc. should lead
the pack. Analysts estimate that U S West profits will rise
14%, from 69.5 cents a share, or $258.1 million, in the
year-earlier quarter. U S West's earnings in the year-earlier
period were hurt by rate reductions in Colorado and a $39
million pretax charge resulting from a settlement reached
with the Minnesota attorney general's office.
   Ameritech and Southwestern Bell Corp., benefiting from
strong new-line growth and usage, are expected to post profit
gains in the 10% range. In the year-earlier quarter,
Ameritech had earnings of $1.06 a share, or $289.1 million,
and Southwestern Bell had profit of 98 cents a share, or
$295.3 million.
   At Nynex Corp., profits should increase about 7% over
year-earlier results, which were depressed by a bitter
strike. BellSouth's earnings are expected to be flat. High
expenditures and rate cuts required for new state regulatory
plans dampened BellSouth's profits. In the year-earlier
quarter, BellSouth earned $404.4 million, or 84 cents a
share, and Nynex had profit of $288.7 million, or $1.47 a
share.
   Profit at Pacific Telesis Group, which have suffered
erosion from a new rate structure in California, are
anticipated to grow 8% in the third quarter. Pacific Telesis
earned $278 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-earlier
quarter. The rate plan, which was introduced last January,
reduced revenue by $391 million.
   Analysts' estimates for Bell Atlantic Corp. range from 3%
to 8% from year-earlier levels of $344.1 million, or 86 cents
a share. Bell Atlantic's results should reflect continued
costs controls and moderate growth in minutes-of-use and new
telephone lines, says Richard Toole, a telecommunications
analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. Mr.
Toole predicts Bell Atlantic's earnings will rise 7% to 8% in
the third quarter.
   For the Bell companies, the third quarter is expected to
show steady growth of 2.5% to 3% in new telephone lines and
7% to 8% in call volumes. In addition, the Bell companies'
cellular communications operations are anticipated to surge
50% to 60%.

   NEW YORK -- International stock funds have produced great
track records for a decade. But this doesn't mean their
managers have been great stock pickers.
   Take a close look at these managers, and you find that
they lagged behind their benchmark index almost as badly as
their U.S. counterparts. This lapse didn't matter much in the
1980s, with foreign stock markets booming. But if
international markets turn out to be more treacherous in the
1990s, then poor performance won't be nearly so palatable for
mutual fund investors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   International funds, which invest largely outside the
U.S., now dominate the list of top performers for the past
five years, and a handful crop up among the 10-year leaders.
According to Morningstar Inc., a Chicago mutual-fund research
concern, international stock funds returned 16.2% a year for
the decade ended Aug. 31, while domestic stock funds plodded
along at 12.2% a year. (Returns include both share-price
changes and dividends.)
   The better performance of international funds hasn't gone
unnoticed by investors, who so far this year have poured $4.8
billion into international funds, more than any other type of
stock mutual fund.
   Yet the managers of these international funds couldn't
help but look smart, compared with their parochial colleagues
who stuck with the U.S. market. Their returns were boosted by
both rapidly rising foreign stock markets and a falling
dollar.
   On average during the decade, foreign stock markets
outpaced the U.S. market by 2.1 percentage points a year.
Then the foreign-currency effect kicked in, bringing U.S.
investors roughly 1.4 percentage points a year extra just
because of the sinking dollar, which meant that the foreign
portfolios were worth more when converted into greenbacks.
   Investors shouldn't take these funds' returns at face
value. When it comes to evaluating performance, it isn't just
total return that counts, but also how a manager performs,
compared with a benchmark index. On this basis, international
stock fund managers are only marginally more skillful than
their colleagues who stick to U.S. stocks.
   A frequently used benchmark for international stock funds
is the Morgan Stanley Capital International stock index for
Europe, Australia and the Far East. For the 10 years ended
Aug. 31, the average international stock fund lagged behind
Morgan Stanley's EAFE index by 2.1 percentage points a year.
By contrast, domestic stock funds fell below the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index of domestic stocks by a slightly wider
margin, 2.6 percentage points a year.
   International stock fund managers may find it tougher to
stay close to the EAFE index in the decade ahead. The
international market is "definitely more competitive than it
was 10 years ago," said Kenneth Gregory, editor of the L/G
No-Load Fund Analyst, a San Francisco newsletter. "It's going
to become more difficult to beat the averages."
   This is bad news for international fund managers, who say
foreign stock-picking is already pretty tough. Running an
international stock fund "is like playing three-dimensional
chess," George Noble, manager of Fidelity Overseas, said.
"It's a lot more challenging than playing the U.S. market."
   Most domestic mutual-fund managers shun grand predictions
about the economy or the stock market's direction, and
instead buy stocks based on their individual merits. Life
isn't so simple for fund managers who invest abroad. These
international stock pickers operate as part foreign-currency
trader, part global economist and part securities analyst. As
a result, said Lori Lucas, a fund analyst with Morningstar
Inc., many international funds end up "just buying baskets of
blue-chip stocks in markets that look attractive."
   Not surprisingly, major mistakes occur. Many fund managers
missed the Tokyo market's spectacular rise from 1986 to 1988,
and as a result, the average international fund lagged behind
the EAFE index by 3.5 percentage points a year over the past
five years. But even if Japan is excluded from the EAFE
index, international funds would still have been laggards,
though only by two percentage points a year.
   "The question is, is it so much more complicated that
you're going to shoot yourself in the foot?" Mr. Gregory, the
newsletter editor, said.
   It seems not. For while most international stock fund
managers trail the index, a few do exceed it. A popular
strategy with the more successful crowd is to exploit
economic themes the managers hope will play out in the next
few years.
   Ivy International's fund manager, Hakan Castegren, for
example, is looking for a recovery among shipping companies
and a pickup in the price of base metals. This has led him to
buy stocks such as Keppel Corp., a Singapore shipbuilder, and
RTZ Corp., a mining conglomerate.
   Many fund managers are trying to make money from German
reunification, but Richard Foulkes, manager of Vanguard
World-International Growth, reckons the biggest stock market
winners won't be German stocks. "We're trying to play the
theme that German demand will be very great, and that the
biggest beneficiaries will be its major trading partners,"
Mr. Foulkes said. He now has 43% of his fund's assets
invested in Continental Europe, with half that money in Dutch
and Swiss stocks. "It's a wonderful situation, sitting next
to a rich cousin and feeding off him," he said.
   William Holzer, manager of Scudder Global Fund, is looking
to exploit a looming world-wide shortage of bank credit. He
points out that West German banks are preoccupied with
reunification, and that U.S. and Japanese banks are cutting
back on new lending because of balance-sheet problems. "The
question arises, where will the available bank credit come
from?" said Mr. Holzer, who believes Swiss banks, such as
Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp., could be
major beneficiaries.
   For those who prefer fund managers who are a little more
systematic in their stock-picking, Vanguard Group offers two
alternatives. One is Trustees' Commingled International,
which is distributed by Vanguard but managed by the
computer-driven investors at Batterymarch Financial
Management of Boston. The fund has beaten the EAFE index over
the past three years, and matched the index over the past
five.
   The other alternative is Vanguard's new international
stock index fund. The fund is divided into two portfolios.
The European Portfolio tracks the Morgan Stanley Capital
International Europe Index by buying a representative sample
of the index's stocks, and the Pacific Portfolio seeks to
replicate the performance of Morgan Stanley's Pacific Index.
To buy the two portfolios in the appropriate proportions,
given the relative size of the two markets, investors would
put 55 cents into the Pacific Portfolio for every 45 cents
going into the European Portfolio.

   REDMOND, Wash. -- Data I/O Corp. said it expects to report
lower-than-anticipated third-quarter sales.
   The electronics company said it expects sales in the
quarter ended Sept. 28 to be $12.5 million to $13.5 million,
about $1.5 million to $2 million less than analysts expected.
Net income in the quarter will about break even, Data I/O
said. The company blamed the sales shortfall on
longer-than-expected production times of certain products.

   Oil companies are expected to bid vigorously for the five
million barrels of crude the government will sell in its test
of the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The Energy Department said it will notify about 250
potential buyers beginning today of how much and what kind of
oil will be sold from the reserve's storage system, and
officials said the department expects queries from many more
interested parties. The oil will be sold from the SPR's four
largest salt caverns, in Texas and Louisiana. The entire
system holds about 590 million barrels.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The oil will be offered in a number of large batches, each
drawing competitive bids due next Friday. Winners can take
possession of their crude in the last two weeks of October or
in November, when they will transport it either on tankers,
barges or through pipelines. "We'll bid," flatly declared
Charlie Mast, vice president of supply of Amoco Corp. in
Chicago. "We'd like to be sure it all works."
   In fact, making sure that the system can function reliably
is the most important aspect of the test as far as
oil-company executives and many government officials are
concerned. The actual amount being sold is tiny; too little
to influence prices in the currently hyper oil market and
less than a third of a day's supply for the U.S. economy.
   The only other time that oil has been withdrawn and sold
from the reserve was during an even smaller, million-barrel
test that began in 1985.
   "It's an excellent idea to test the hardware and the
procedures," said Ernie W. Stamper, an administrative vice
president for the gasoline refining and marketing unit of
Ashland Oil Inc. in Ashland, Ky.
   At a hearing of a House Energy subcommittee, Rep. John
Dingell (D., Mich.) said he has "substantial doubts" whether
the oil drawdown will proceed smoothly, fearing equipment
breakdowns and expressing concern over the type of oil to be
sold. Many industry executives also worry about a bidding
process that allows traders as well as refiners to
participate.
   Calling the test sale "extremely important," Energy
Secretary James Watkins conceded, "I can't say it's going to
work perfectly." In fact, Mr. Watkins told lawmakers the
department would prefer a bigger test sale of 15 million
barrels that would more closely simulate the "long-term,
high-pressure, high-volume" crude drawdowns that would be
required in an emergency. Overall, he insisted however, "We
are ready to move oil." Several lawmakers began drafting
legislation that would quickly authorize a larger test.
   SPR officials met with oil-company executives in Houston
in late August to help prepare for a simulated sale scheduled
for October. In effect, that now has been turned into the
real thing. "It has gone from paper to wet," said an Energy
Department spokesman in New Orleans.
   Test procedures shouldn't be unfamiliar to oil companies;
during the SPR's 1985 test, oil was also sold in batches,
with 35 bidders competing for five allotments that varied in
location and chemical makeup. For instance, Phillips
Petroleum Co. successfully bid for 300,000 barrels of crude
from the Bryan Mound storage dome near Freeport, Texas, and
300,000 barrels from the Weeks Island facility in Iberia
Parish, La.
   "We didn't have any surprises," recalled Mike Dabbar,
Phillips's manager of crude oil supply. Because of the August
meeting with the Energy Department, Mr. Dabbar said Phillips
has a good sense of the oil that might become available and
what Phillips might bid for after notices go out by overnight
delivery today.
   Like other oil-company buyers of crude, he spent yesterday
in meetings laying bidding plans. Winning bidders will be
notified Oct. 10 and must submit financial guarantees before
Oct. 17.
   The SPR oil will move into the hands of buyers in any of
three ways: pipeline, tanker and barge. For instance, oil
from the Bayou Choctaw salt dome near Baton Rouge, La., can
go by pipeline to a nearby dock where tankers or barges can
load it. It can also go by pipeline to nearby refineries or
into a large commercial pipeline system called Capline that
feeds Midwestern refineries. Most winning buyers will
probably use pipelines if they can because that is generally
the least expensive way to transport oil.
   Amoco's Mr. Mast said any oil his company buys would
probably be turned into gasoline, heating oil and other
refined products at just two of its seven refineries, in
Texas City, Texas, and Whiting, Ind., because both can
receive SPR oil directly from pipelines.
   Aside from location, the oil will also be sold based on
sulfur content. Two-thirds of SPR oil is "sour," or high in
sulfur, which makes it impractical for many refineries
because it would destroy equipment. The Energy Department
said 2.8 million barrels, or 56% of the sale, will be sour
crude.
   A big concern of oil companies is the auction process
itself, which will allow any party to bid. To qualify, a
would-be bidder needs only to put up a certified check or
letter of credit equal to 5% of the maximum potential
contract or $10 million, whichever is less, officials told
energy executives at the August meeting.
   Some refiners worry that traders may buy the oil and try
to sell it for a profit rather than refine it. But one crude
oil trading house said it hasn't considered participating in
the SPR sale. "We haven't even talked about it," its head
trader said.
   At the urging of oil companies, the Energy Department
changed the pricing mechanism for SPR crude to reflect market
pricing. The highest bidder will be assured of possession,
but at a final price that will fluctuate based on a market
barometer at the time of delivery up to eight weeks later.
That way, if the market price, say, falls $10 a barrel
between the bid and delivery, the final delivery price will
be reduced by the same amount.
   If crude prices remain at or above their current levels of
around $40 a barrel as the test sale proceeds, the government
stands to make a hefty paper profit. The average price the
U.S. paid for SPR crude is $27.22 a barrel.

   Electric Utilities See Pending Legislation
   As Threat to Reliability of Power Supply

   WASHINGTON -- Electric utility companies, already
concerned about a long-term shortage of capacity, worry that
pending federal legislation is only going to make matters
worse.
   In a revised annual 10-year forecast, the North American
Electric Reliability Council cited pending changes in the
Clean Air Act as "the most significant threat" to reliability
of electrical power.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Michehl R. Gent, vice president of the council, said the
main concern is that many electric-power companies will find
it too expensive to meet new strict pollution-control
standards and will be forced to close older facilities sooner
than planned. Such a development, Mr. Gent said, could
exacerbate the pressing power-supply situation in many parts
of the country, particularly areas east of the Mississippi
River.
   Already power companies have been forced to reduce voltage
in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern parts of the country
when demand exceeded available supplies during extreme cold
or hot spells.
   The Reliability Council, formed by utility companies and
comprising nine regional groups, attempts to provide a
long-range industry view of the nation's electric-power
needs.
   Even without stricter pollution-control legislation,
however, the growing demand for electricity -- especially in
peak summer and winter periods -- has a lot of energy experts
worried. In its report released yesterday, the council, for
example, increased by 5% its estimates of peak utility demand
for 1997.
   While energy experts say short-term power supplies should
be adequate, the long-term picture is less assuring. Although
conceding that forecasting energy demand is tricky, the
latest study predicts that the U.S. will need an additional
7,500 megawatts of power-generating capability in the 1990s
if it wants to keep up with demand and provide reliable
service. That 7,500-megawatt figure is lower than the 13,000
megawatts the council projected last year, but is still
disturbing, says Mr. Gent. Officials said the figure declined
because of improved forecasting methods, rather than a drop
in expected demand.
   Nonetheless, electric utilities are continuing to slow
down construction of new facilities. The NERC's latest study
shows that construction isn't yet under way on 55% of the new
generating capacity previously announced for the next 10
years in the U.S. That gap is up from 41% last year and just
30% two years ago. Thus, forecasters worry that there's more
risk that power mightn't be available when it is needed.
   Some utility regulators are also worried about the impact
of the new legislation. "Everyone is in favor of clean air,"
says Cas Robinson, a member of the Georgia Public Service
Commission. "But is the public willing to pay for it?"
   Nancy Kete, a senior policy analyst at the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, dismissed the notion that
the Clean Air amendments will threaten the nation's
electric-power supplies. "I don't think it's a well-founded
fear. The EPA is just as concerned as anybody about
electricity reliability. When it {the legislation} is
explained, they will realize it won't make a big difference
in energy supply," she said.
   Slowing the pace of adding capacity is the complicated
question of what type of fuel should be used to generate
electricity. At the moment, more than half of the nation's
electric power comes from coal-burning generators. Natural
gas, oil, nuclear energy and renewable energy sources
generate the rest. But with growing environmental pressures
and fear of deeper dependence on foreign oil supplies, the
utilities are left struggling to find economical and
environmentally safe solutions.
   In the past, electric utilities facing capacity crunches
have been able to turn to their neighbors to buy extra power.
Those days, however, may be numbered. As the strains on
capacity spread, experts say neighboring utilities may be
more reluctant to sell.

   TORONTO -- John Labatt Ltd., a brewing and consumer
products concern, and Canada Packers Inc., a packaging and
food products concern, said they plan to combine their flour
milling operations and related businesses.
   The new partnership would have assets of about 310 million
Canadian dollars (US$268.3 million), the two companies said.
The Canada Packers operations had 1989 sales of C$430.7
million, and the Labatt businesses had sales of C$425.7
million in the year ended April 30.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The plan calls for Labatt to put its Ogilvie Mills Ltd.
unit, which includes flour and oat milling, and starch,
bakery and pizza operations into the partnership. The Canada
Packers business units to be contributed include flour
milling operations, bakeries and retail franchise lines.
   Canada Packers would hold 60% and Labatt 40% of the
partnership, to be called Maple Leaf-Ogilvie, in which they
will invest about C$40 million to upgrade the capacity of
Montreal-area flour mills.
   The transaction, which the companies said they hope to
complete by year end, is subject to regulatory approval by
Canada's competition watchdog and foreign investment
regulators. Hillsdown PLC of Britain holds a 56% stake in
Canada Packers.
   The move is Labatt's latest step to decrease its exposure
to food and other consumer products. Last year, the company
sold its Catelli Inc. pasta and foods unit, fueling
speculation that the next asset for sale would be the Ogilvie
milling operations. A Labatt official said a partnership was
the best option to pursue, "due to Canada's loss of export
markets for flour and resulting inefficiencies for Canadian
millers." Canada's share of the world export market for flour
fell to 7% in 1989 from more than 30% in the years following
World War II.

   Dividend News:
   Unisys Omits
   Stock Dividend,
   Stock Falls 23%

<LP>
   Unisys Corp. said its board voted to omit the quarterly
dividend of 25 cents a share on common stock, sending the
already depressed stock tumbling a further 23%.
   In an interview, James Unruh, chief executive officer of
the computer and defense-electronics concern, also backed
away from assurances earlier this year that Unisys would be
profitable for the full year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unisys, whose prospects have been deteriorating for almost
two years, indicated it decided to omit the dividend partly
because of the worsening outlook for the world economy. In
addition, Mr. Unruh said that business had weakened this
quarter in Europe, which had been a mainstay for the company
as it tried to deal with sluggishness in the U.S. Early signs
of problems in Europe, disclosed in the second-quarter
earnings report, had sparked the latest round of concern
among investors about Unisys.
   Unisys, Blue Bell, Pa., said it continued to make its
promised progress in tackling its biggest problem: the hefty
debt load. The company reduced debt by $325 million in the
first half, from around $4 billion, or 50% of its total stock
and debt, and Unisys said it should meet its target of a $600
million to $800 million reduction over the full year. Unisys
added that it expects to cut debt by at least that much in
1991.
   But Mr. Unruh said he thought it was prudent to omit the
dividend, saving Unisys nearly $160 million a year. He said
he thought the move would maximize shareholder value --
although it certainly didn't in the short term, as the stock
tumbled $1.625 to $5.375 in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. That drop means that Unisys, with $10 billion
in annual sales, carries a market value of $800 million. The
stock has been as high as $17.125 as recently as March.
   The Unisys statement also confirmed securities analysts'
predictions that the company will report a loss for the third
quarter. Analysts generally expect a loss of 10 cents to 35
cents a share. That compares with the year-earlier loss of
$648.2 million, or $4.25 a share, which included a $230
million special charge related to plant closings and
extensive job cuts.
   Unisys reiterated that it expects to be profitable in the
fourth quarter. The company -- which some analysts had said
as recently as June should earn $2 a share this year -- may
still show a profit for the full year, Mr. Unruh said. But
that will require a strong fourth quarter; in the first half
the company earned just $8.6 million, which translated into a
loss of 28 cents a share because of heavy preferred-dividend
requirements. And Mr. Unruh said that "it's becoming more
hazardous to predict, given the rapidly changing economic
environment."
   While the company has continued to make progress in
cutting inventories -- which were last year's biggest problem
-- it has lost the momentum it got from the replacement last
year of aging mainframe and minicomputer lines. In addition,
competition in the computer industry has remained cutthroat.
That is especially true for systems that use the Unix
operating system, an area that Unisys has decided must
constitute its future.
   Unisys is expected to announce on Monday a broad software
strategy to tie together the different types of hardware and
software it sells, making it easier for all its computers to
talk to each other. The strategy will focus, in particular,
on customers, such as banks and airlines, that need to
process many transactions rapidly. Mr. Unruh, while declining
to provide details, said: "We think this is very
significant." But most of the company's big competitors have
already announced similar plans. In any case, the strategy
won't help in the short term, because such conceptual moves
tend to unfold over several years.

   LONDON -- Brent Walker Group PLC said first-half pretax
profit rose 52%, but it cautioned that its high level of debt
and the general state of the U.K. economy are still cause for
concern.
   The U.K. leisure group said pretax profit climbed to #45.7
million ($85.6 million) from #30 million ($56.2 million) a
year earlier, exceeding the general level of market
expectations, which was around #40 million. In a statement to
the London Stock Exchange Friday, the company said the
results would meet expectations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales in the latest period leaped to #1.02 billion from
#203 million. Trading profit rose 94% to #93 million from #48
million.
   Brent Walker also said it intends to raise between #100
million and #120 million through an issue of 13% convertible
capital bonds. The issue, through its Brent Walker Capital
Ltd. subsidiary, is aimed at reducing debt, which the company
recently said totaled #1.25 billion.
   The company said profit after tax rose 49% to #36.3
million from #24.4 million. Per-share earnings rose 54% to
42.9 pence from 27.9 pence. Profit attributable to
shareholders, however, fell 45% to #35.3 million from #63.9
million. The latest results included a one-time loss of #1.1
million. The company had a one-time gain of #39.5 million a
year earlier.
   Brent Walker said it is leaving its interim dividend
unchanged at five pence a share because of the company's high
level of debt and the weakening U.K. economy. But it said its
continuing growth in profit reinforced its decision to
concentrate on the core sectors of leisure development: pubs
and brewing, betting services, and hotels and leisure.

   NEW YORK -- Construction contracting dropped 3% in August,
but that reflects virtually no change in the recent weak rate
of building activity, the latest F.W. Dodge report said.
   F.W. Dodge, the forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., said
total construction startup rates slipped to $230.14 billion
in August, from $236.31 billion in July. The seasonally
adjusted annual rate brought the Dodge index of contract
values down to 146 from 150 the previous month, as was
expected based on fluctuations reported since last winter's
steep decline. The index uses 1982 as a base of 100.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Regarding the impact of the Middle East conflict on the
value of new construction, George A. Christie, vice president
and chief economist for F.W. Dodge said, "The risk, of
course, is whether higher-cost oil will tip the already
weakened economy into recession by next winter. Chances are
it will, and that implies a secondary decline for
construction, particularly for commercial building and
housing."
   Values for both nonresidential and residential building
eased 4% in August. Office building remained the weakest
segment, with an August rate of $77.52 billion, down from
$80.34 billion in July, when the level plummeted 23% to its
lowest level in a decade. Nonbuilding construction, including
public works and utilities, edged up 1% due to a surge of
sewer and water projects.
   Through the eight months of 1990, total contracting values
fell 8% from the year ago period. The Northeast region
remained most depressed with a 24% shortfall for the eight
months, followed by the Southeast, which reported a 14% drop.
The only gain this year was in the North Central region,
which rose 3% in August.

   Supporters of Joe Shoen Take New Steps
   To Strengthen Grip on U-Haul Empire

   In the latest front of a bitter family war, chairman E.J.
"Joe" Shoen and his sibling allies are moving to tighten
their grip on Amerco, the Phoenix, Ariz., holding company for
the U-Haul rental empire.
   In a series of measures to be voted on at today's annual
shareholders' meeting in remote Tonopah, Nev., Mr. Shoen's
group seeks changes in Amerco's articles of incorporation
that would ban shareholder action by written consent, require
two-thirds of shareholders to approve any new corporate
bylaws and institute a stock-split plan that would put
millions of unissued shares at the disposal of current
management. Also on the table is a new system of electing
board members that includes four-year terms for Mr. Shoen and
U-Haul International president Mark Shoen, his brother and
primary supporter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If passed, the changes would further blunt U-Haul founder
L.S. Shoen's campaign to oust Joe Shoen, the son who toppled
him as chairman in 1986, claiming that his father's far-flung
diversification program was ruining the closely held company.
   This month, the Arizona Court of Appeals dealt the elder
Mr. Shoen another blow by upholding a lower state court's
refusal to block management's 1988 issuance of Amerco
treasury shares to friendly parties. That action tilted the
balance of power in Joe Shoen's favor.
   The chairman's group now controls about 53% of
Phoenix-based Amerco's outstanding shares; barring any
defections, that assures passage of the amendments. "It is an
outrageous thing," grumbled Marvin Johnson, L.S. Shoen's
attorney. "But I don't see how you can keep a board of
directors from doing what they are doing."
   L.S. Shoen and his supporters have been further shaken by
the Aug. 6 murder of Eva Shoen, wife of former U-Haul
president Sam Shoen, who backs his father. The 44-year-old
mother of two was shot in the bedroom of the family's
Telluride, Colo., home while her husband was in Phoenix
working on U-Haul litigation. The San Miguel County
(Colorado) Sheriff's Department has ruled out sexual assault,
robbery and burglary as motives, but has released few other
details of the still unsolved crime.
   Meanwhile, L.S. Shoen has reportedly given the sheriff's
department $50,000 to defray the costs of the investigation
and hired a public relations company to handle press
inquiries. Angrily denouncing rumors that the murder might be
connected to the family feud, Mark Shoen announced that
U-Haul was hiring its own private investigator to pursue the
case.
   The investigator has since released a report criticizing
the sheriff's investigation and calling the murder part of a
botched kidnap-for-ransom scheme.
   "His theories are not based on reality," said San Miguel
Sheriff Bill Masters. "He must be talking to Bozo the Clown."
   In the midst of this continuing turmoil, Amerco posted
disappointing results for the fiscal year ended March 31. The
company reported net income of $18.5 million, down 49% from
the prior year's $36.2 million, despite a 2.4% gain in
revenue to $950.9 million.
   The company blamed the earnings decline on disappointing
results from its general rental item and recreational vehicle
subsidiaries, lower-than-expected used-vehicle sales and
increased costs associated with its vehicle-replacement
campaign.
   Despite the drop in earnings, analysts say that U-Haul's
core rental business continues to show improvement as the
company replaces its once-aging fleet with new trucks and
trailers. "The general trend of the company is still
positive," said Philip Baggaley, a transportation analyst at
Standard and Poors. "However, it's sort of two steps forward
and one step back."

   Law:
   Hearing Will Delay Milken Sentencing

   NEW YORK -- A federal judge delayed the sentencing of
Michael Milken, scheduled for Monday, and ordered an unusual
hearing to consider additional crimes the government has
alleged Mr. Milken committed, but to which he hasn't pleaded
guilty.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said she would hold a
two-week hearing to air the government's allegations against
the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond king. The
hearing will likely be held next month. Judge Wood said she
planned to give both prosecutors and defense lawyers 20 hours
each to present arguments and cross-examine witnesses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As previously reported, prosecutors had sought such a
hearing -- over the strenuous objections of Mr. Milken's
lawyers -- and have notified lawyers for witnesses who aided
the government in its case against Mr. Milken that these
witnesses may be called to testify.
   Among the witnesses the government has indicated it may
call are Ivan F. Boesky, the convicted former Wall Street
stock speculator, and David Solomon, a former money manager.
Prosecutors have also notified former Drexel employees that
they may be called.
   Yesterday, Arthur Liman, Mr. Milken's lead lawyer, opposed
such a hearing, saying it "will prolong the agony" of Mr.
Milken's family. Mr. Liman said he would talk to prosecutors
during the weekend to see if a hearing could be avoided.
   Prosecutors sought the hearing because they want Judge
Wood to consider the full force of their case against Mr.
Milken when she sentences him. Mr. Milken pleaded guilty last
April to six felony counts relating to securities fraud and
faces a maximum jail term of 28 years.
   The government has urged Judge Wood to sentence Mr. Milken
to "substantial" jail time and has painted the 44-year-old
Mr. Milken as a white-collar criminal of major proportions.
In a sentencing memorandum made public earlier this week, the
government unleashed a barrage of additional alleged crimes
that it believes Mr. Milken committed. The alleged crimes
include insider trading and illegal payoffs to certain money
managers and other favored clients.
   Mr. Milken's attorneys have urged Judge Wood to view Mr.
Milken's crimes as aberrations in an otherwise exemplary life
and to sentence him to perform fulltime community service.
His lawyers have accused the government of presenting
evidence of offenses that Mr. Milken has "never acknowledged
and has never committed."
   In calling for the extraordinary hearing, Judge Wood said
that the court may take into account unadmitted conduct in
issuing a sentence. "Considering unadmitted conduct gives the
court a sense of a defendant's character," Judge Wood said.
   She said that to avoid a lengthy hearing on all of the
government's allegations, she would limit the time that the
government could spend presenting its case. She said she
expected the government to concentrate on less than a dozen
of the transactions it has alleged were illegal, but to which
Mr. Milken hasn't admitted guilt.
   A judge is not obligated to take the government's
additional allegations into consideration when deciding on an
appropriate sentence. But if Judge Wood decides she wishes to
consider the additional evidence in meting out a sentence,
Mr. Milken is entitled to defend himself at a hearing.
   A similar battle over sentencing took place earlier this
year in the case against Robert Freeman, the former head of
arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. who pleaded guilty to a
single charge of insider trading. In that case, the judge
said that in issuing a sentence, he wouldn't consider any
crimes other than that to which Mr. Freeman pleaded guilty.
The government alleged that Mr. Freeman committed some 20
other crimes.

   GM Cuts Discounts
   On Certain Models
   In 1990, 1991 Lines

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. is raising prices on some
1990 and 1991 models by cutting the cash discounts offered to
buyers.
   In effect, the No. 1 auto maker is joining Ford Motor Co.
in a gamble that efforts to boost revenue in a slumping
market won't cost market share in the competition against
Japanese auto makers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   GM didn't raise prices as much as Ford, which earlier this
week eliminated cash-to-customer rebates on leftover 1990
models and sharply scaled back the discounts on many
high-volume 1991 models. Unlike Ford, GM left cash discounts
on most 1990 models. However, rebates on some high-volume
1990 and 1991 Chevrolet models will be substantially less
than they were just a few days ago.
   For example, someone who bought a 1990 Chevrolet Corsica
Monday got a $1,000 cash rebate. But buying a 1990 Corsica
today will mean only $500 off the sticker price, in effect a
$500 price boost.
   GM is raising the prices on 1991 Corsicas, too, by cutting
the cash rebate to $500 from $750. Similarly, the rebate on
1990 Chevrolet Lumina mid-sized sedans was cut to $500 from
as much as $1,500.
   "Certainly we watch what other people do," a Chevrolet
spokesman said. The decision to cut back on rebates in part
reflects lower stocks of unsold cars on GM dealer lots, he
said.
   GM isn't raising prices on every model. Some weak-selling
models will come with even bigger discounts. The rebate on
certain 1990 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Coupes rose to $2,500
from $2,000. The discount on other Cutlass Supremes will
remain at $2,000.
   GM's bid to raise prices on high-volume lines reflects
growing pessimism about the strength of the U.S. auto market.
GM and Ford, by raising prices, are signaling that they're
resigned to a period of weak sales.

   WASHINGTON -- Budget negotiators were approaching a
compromise that would limit tax deductions for the rich and
reduce the tax bite on capital gains less than President Bush
was asking, people close to the talks said.
   The package on the table as the talks continued last night
also would tax more of Social Security benefits paid to
middle- and upper-income elderly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're awfully close to having an agreement in principle .
. . which would require a White House foray" today to brief
the president, a Republican staffer close to the talks said.
   But Democratic aides cautioned that the negotiators --
five top congressional leaders and three Bush administration
officials -- hadn't yet shaken hands on an agreement. "We're
a long way from Tipperary," said one.
   Moreover, Budget Director Richard Darman cautioned against
too much optimism.
   One issue that remained unresolved was the shape of the
capital-gains tax cut. Although one option was an
administration plan to tax only those gains in excess of
inflation, an approach known as indexing, some Democrats had
reservations. Last night, Democrats were still talking about
reducing the top rate on capital gains from the current 33%.
This would be offset not only with new limits on deductions,
but also by an increase in the marginal income tax rate, now
28%, paid by the highest-income Americans. Democrats aren't
any longer pushing to raise the rate as high as 33%, however,
sources said.
   Although the specifics remained in flux, House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) briefed
Democratic members of his panel on the outlines of a possible
package to reduce the deficit by $500 billion over five
years.
   He said, and others confirmed, that the package under
discussion also included an increase to 17 cents from nine
cents a gallon in the gasoline tax, effective before the end
of 1990, to raise nearly $40 billion over five years; an
increase in taxes on alcoholic beverages to raise between $12
billion and $14 billion over five years; an increase of less
than 10 cents in the cigarette tax, currently 16 cents a
pack; and a new 10% levy on certain luxury goods. Of the $500
billion in deficit reduction over five years, about $130
billion net would come from taxes.
   Among the elements the California Democrat listed, and
confirmed by others, were a plan to raise $20 billion over
five years by subjecting to income taxes 85% of the Social
Security benefits paid to upper-income Americans. Currently,
50% of the benefits paid to couples with annual incomes above
$32,000 and individuals with incomes above $25,000 are taxed.
   Republicans had been resisting that approach for weeks,
saying it shouldn't be counted as reducing spending on Social
Security, but instead as a tax increase.
   The package is likely to be politically explosive, and
rank-and-file members of both parties have been warning their
leaders that their votes aren't assured. For all the
attention paid to capital gains, congressmen representing
working-class, urban districts said the issue was far less
relevant to their constituents than cuts in health care or
new excise taxes. "If I go back to Atlanta and say we held
the line on capital gains but we did you in on Medicare,
they'll say you're not bringing us good news," said Rep. John
Lewis (D., Ga.).
   Conversely, representatives of more affluent districts and
conservatives were troubled by the reports that negotiators
were considering tax, Medicare and Social Security changes
that aimed at middle and upper-income constituents. "They may
be agreeing on something the rest of us ain't going to buy,"
said Sen. Trent Lott (R., Miss.). "They'd better check with
us troops."
   In all, about $60 billion of the $500 billion in deficit
reduction over five years would come from cutting projected
Medicare spending -- including an increase in the premium the
elderly pay to cover doctor bills, the congressional sources
said. They said the premium, currently $28.60 a month, would
be raised to cover 30% of the costs of this part of the
program, up from the 25% the law currently provides. The
deductible would also be raised to $150 from $75.
   An accord in the next day or two, even if details remain
unsettled, probably would give Congress and President Bush
enough of an excuse to delay the spending cuts directed by
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, cuts that are
scheduled to bite into federal spending Monday.
   Republicans have been pushing limits on tax deductions for
upper-income Americans for months as a way to offset a cut in
capital-gains taxes, which largely would benefit those same
well-off taxpayers. Initially, the GOP proposed to limit only
deductions for state and local income taxes, but later they
broadened their plan to cover all deductions.
   One variant under discussion by negotiators, which
resembles proposals crafted by Rep. Don Pease (D., Ohio),
would limit overall deductions for taxpayers with incomes
above $100,000. A taxpayer with income of $150,000, for
instance, would face a floor of $5,000 (10% of the difference
between $150,000 and $100,000). If the taxpayer's deductions
totaled $45,000, he would be allowed to deduct only $40,000
(or $45,000 minus $5,000). But details weren't firm last
night.
   One reason the Democrats are so intent on completing the
task that began in May is that they fear they'll be blamed if
the government isn't able to keep operating after the fiscal
year begins Monday. House Democrats were inclined to pass a
Democratic alternative budget to put the onus on Mr. Bush for
the failure of the budget talks. But that plan was scrapped
after Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) told
House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) that he didn't have
the votes in the Senate to pass such a bill.
   Negotiations shifted to the dinner table at one point last
night, as the three administration bargainers -- Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu and Mr. Darman -- invited themselves to join Sen.
Mitchell in the senators' private dining room.
   But even as his top advisers were working to narrow their
differences with Congress in Washington, Mr. Bush was
criticizing congressional Democrats in campaign speeches in
the Midwest. "Congress has got to stop being manic depressive
-- manic on spending, depressive for the economy," he said.
   In discussions of how to structure a cut in capital-gains
taxes -- one of President Bush's campaign promises and a
sticking point in the talks from the start -- negotiators
also have talked about targeting an additional tax break on
investments in start-up companies.
   The negotiators also tentatively agreed to permanently
extend tax credits for research and development spending and
for people who build low-income housing. The plan also would
temporarily extend some other soon-to-expire tax breaks.
   To help low-income individuals, the plan would increase
the refundable earned-income tax credit for the working poor,
and Democrats were pressing for an increase in the standard
deduction taken by taxpayers who don't itemize.
   One issue that remained unsettled was whether to include
an expansion of the child-care tax credit in the
deficit-reduction package. Although such a provision could be
costly, it also would help satisfy Democrats' demand that the
overall package not hit lower- and middle-income Americans
harder than those in upper-income brackets.
   Although plans to alter the congressional budget process
get little attention outside Washington, they remain an
important part of the negotiations. Democrats appear ready to
agree to Republican demands that any package include new
fixed deficit targets for the next five years, rather than
simply deficit-reduction goals. Total appropriations would be
capped for each of the five years, but Democrats have
resisted Republican demands to specify the ceilings on
defense and non-defense spending for each year as well.
   One sticky issue, however, is whether the Appropriations
committees would be permitted to use some additional
gasoline-tax revenues for highway spending in excess of the
ceilings.
   The talks began in mid-May at the call of President Bush
whose advisers urged him to seek a deficit compromise to help
bring down interest rates and reduce the risk of recession.
But the talks, which initially involved 21 members of
Congress, made little headway until the president disavowed
his no-new-taxes campaign pledge on June 26.
   Even after that, the talks sputtered along through the
summer. After Labor Day, the bargainers secluded themselves
at nearby Andrews Air Force Base, taking over the officers'
bar and VIP bungalows. What started as a weekend stay became
an 11-day ordeal, and the hoped-for candor and compromise was
lost amid recrimination over news leaks.
   Finally, 10 days ago, the five highest-ranking
congressional leaders and the three administration officials
excluded others from the bargaining table, and returned to
the Capitol for the latest intensive round. In the end, the
fundamental differences that vexed negotiators from the start
were among the final issues to be resolved: the balance
between taxes, cuts in domestic spending and cuts in defense
spending.
   As reported previously, negotiators have agreed roughly to
reduce spending on benefit programs by about $120 billion and
defense spending by about $170 billion, in addition to
raising revenues by about $130 billion over five years,. The
remaining $70 billion in deficit reduction would come from
lower-than-forecast interest payments.

   A LIST of the world's 25 largest securities firms compiled
by Wright Investors Service should have given Nomura
Securities' capital as $12.8 billion, not $10.9 billion. The
list represents figures as of each company's 1989 fiscal
year's end. In addition, Principal Mutual Life is based in
the U.S., not the U.K. as indicated in the list of the
world's 50 largest insurers. Both lists appeared in The Wall
Street Journal Report on world business.
