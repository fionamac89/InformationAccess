   Stock prices slipped a little while investors nudged bond
prices higher as financial markets remained in neutral during
the shortened holiday week.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.35 points to close
at 2729.73 in sluggish trading. Long-term bond prices
rebounded modestly from their sell-off Tuesday. The dollar
was mixed.

   Oil prices provided what little excitement there was in
financial markets yesterday. Oil prices tumbled in late New
York trading Tuesday and continued to fall yesterday after
the American Petroleum Institute released figures that showed
burgeoning inventories of crude oil. But speculation that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is on the verge
of calling an emergency meeting helped prices rebound late
yesterday.
   Although neither the stock nor the bond market reacted
sharply to the fluctuations in oil prices, tumbling crude
prices touched off a minor bond-market rally while prompting
investors to sell oil stocks and buy airlines issues.
   The gains in bond prices eased later as oil prices
rebounded, but the oil stocks ended down while airline issues
held on to most of their gains. Overall, though, stock
investors remain worried about the outlook for first-quarter
earnings.
   In major market action:

   Stock prices slipped slightly in slack trading. Volume on
the New York Stock Exchange totaled 141.1 million shares.
Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 762
to 720.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices edged higher. The Treasury's benchmark issue
ended nearly 1/4 point higher, a gain of about $2.50 for a
bond with a $1,000 face amount. The yield on the issue
dropped to 8.57%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late afternoon New York trading
the currency was at 1.6715 marks and 158 yen, compared with
1.6755 marks and 157.60 yen Tuesday.

   Ford Calls a Truce in Battle With GM
   With New Ad Campaign for Its Trucks

   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. is attempting to call a
cease-fire in its fierce truck advertising war with General
Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet division.
   The No. 2 auto maker also is sharply boosting ad spending
for the launch of its Explorer sport utility vehicle in hopes
of attracting affluent young suburbanites who make up the
core of Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep Cherokee buyers. Chrysler,
meanwhile, is considering a plan that would lower prices on
some Cherokee models in response to Explorer and other
competitors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At a meeting with reporters here yesterday, Ford unveiled
a new truck ad campaign scheduled to begin Sunday night. It
will highlight Ford's leadership in U.S. truck sales as well
as several technological features of its vehicles. But it
will stop short of directly comparing Ford and Chevy models.
   Many ads run by the auto makers over the past two years
have heavily criticized each other's trucks. Ford officials
said the battle quickly became a game of one-upmanship that
left consumers behind.
   "We've spent, over the course of the past year, a great
deal of advertising money asking consumers what they think
about (the ad wars), and in all honesty they think it's a
bunch of baloney from our side and Chevrolet's side," said
John B. Vanderzee, advertising manager of Ford's Ford
division. "We're not interested in advertising wars anymore."
   The new Ford ads will carry the slogan "Ford Trucks: The
Best Never Rest" and they won't mention any of Ford's truck
sales rivals by name. However, Mr. Vanderzee said Ford
tailored the ad campaign so it can take on competitors such
as Chevrolet if they renew attacks against Ford products.
   Ford has widened its lead over Chevrolet during the past
year. Ford was ahead by 63,460 trucks for the first six
months of the 1990 model year, compared with 51,328 a year
earlier.
   Mr. Vanderzee said Ford will spend slightly more on the
new campaign, which will include ads for all of Ford's trucks
except Explorer and the Ford Aerostar minivan. Ads for these
two models are currently aimed more toward car than truck
buyers.
   Ford began running television ads for Explorer last
weekend. Mr. Vanderzee said the auto maker will spend three
times as much on Explorer this year as it spent last year to
advertise the Bronco II model Explorer replaces.
   The Explorer is Ford's first four-door Jeep-like vehicle;
it also comes in a two-door version. Adding the four-door
model should boost sales to about 100,000 Explorers this year
and 220,000 in following years, Ford estimates. That compares
with top Bronco II sales of 124,109 units in 1988.
   Most of the new Explorer ads are aimed at families and
women, Mr. Vanderzee said. Ford expects women to make up 50%
of Explorer's owners, compared with 30% for Bronco II.
   The stepped up competition from Ford and other auto makers
in the four-door sport utility vehicle market is apparently
forcing Chrysler to consider cutting its profit margin on the
Cherokee to hang on to market share.
   Chrysler plans to bring out this fall a "value" version of
the four-door Cherokee that will sell for less than the
$20,200 average most Cherokee buyers currently pay, according
to Jeep dealers and a Jeep spokesman, who confirmed a report
in the trade journal Automotive News. Jeep dealers, who have
pressed Chrysler to come up with more affordable versions of
Cherokee, say they expect the "value" Cherokee will sell for
between $16,000 and $18,000.
   The "value" Cherokee would have as standard equipment
certain features, such as automatic transmission and air
conditioning, that are currently sold as options.
   A Jeep spokesman said the division expects the "value"
Cherokee to be a "high volume" seller, but wouldn't confirm a
price range for the vehicle. He did say the model won't be
the least expensive in the Cherokee line, which currently
starts at about $13,000.

   Capital Outlays
   To Grow 7.8%
   At U.S. Firms

   Commerce Survey Shows
   Higher Spending in '90
   Than Earlier Forecasts

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. businesses, showing unexpected optimism
about the economy, plan to increase capital spending 7.8%
this year, the Commerce Department reported.
   Despite evidence that business activity remains sluggish,
companies told the department in a survey taken in January
and February that they plan to spend $512.82 billion on new
plant and equipment this year. In a survey taken this past
autumn, the companies had projected a 6.4% increase.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The figures reflect: one, the weakest part of the
economic cycle is behind us; and two, the competitive reality
of the global marketplace," said David Littmann, senior
economist at Manufacturer's National Bank of Detroit.
   This year's expected growth would follow two years of
booming capital spending, and could keep the eight-year
economic expansion alive. The survey suggests higher spending
than econometric models have been forecasting, said Gordon
Richards, an economist for the National Association of
Manufacturers. Many analysts didn't anticipate companies
would increase capital spending as much because economic
growth has been slow because of high interest rates.
   After adjusting for inflation, the department estimated
capital spending would increase 7.6% in 1990 to $503.41
billion, after rising 8.6% last year to $467.83 billion.
   Overall capital spending is likely to be bolstered
especially this year by strong investment among service
industries in office-automation equipment. Non-manufacturing
businesses plan to increase their capital spending 9.7% --
not adjusted for inflation -- a rise just slightly less than
last year's 10% increase.
   Manufacturing industries plan to increase spending on new
plants and equipment just 4.9% this year. Although that's
more than the 3.8% increase they planned for 1990 at the time
of this past fall's survey, the figure is still substantially
lower than the 11% growth in 1989.
   Durable goods manufacturers plan to increase capital
spending 2.1% in 1990. The aircraft industry plans to boost
its spending 9.3%, while manufacturers of electrical
machinery project an 8% increase for this year. The survey
shows that the automobile sector plans to decrease its
capital spending 11.3%.
   Manufacturers of nondurable goods plan to spend 7.1% more
this year on new plants and equipment. In the fall, they
expected 6.8% growth. All the figures are seasonally
adjusted.
   Many economists believe that investment won't track
overall economic activity as closely in the 1990s as in the
past, but will be driven instead by the need of U.S.
companies to meet mounting global competition. The economists
suggest that, in turn, could help reduce cyclical swings in
economic activity. "The capital spending trends in the 90s
will transcend the business cycles," said Mr. Littman.
                                                                                                       

   Here is the breakdown by major industries of capital
spending results for past periods and estimates for current
and future periods. For comparability with annual totals, the
quarterly figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates, in
billions of dollars:

   Another Round of Bank Intervention
   Is Unable to Revive the Slumping Yen

   NEW YORK -- Another round of token intervention failed to
revive the Japanese yen and convinced many traders that the
Group of Seven industrial nations is unwilling to throw any
weight behind its recent statements.
   But while the dollar finished the global session firmer
against the yen, it was mixed against other major currencies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6715 marks, down from 1.6755 marks late Tuesday, and at
158 yen, up from 157.60 yen late Tuesday. Sterling was quoted
at $1.6433, down from $1.6453 Tuesday.
   Early Thursday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 158.45
yen, off slightly from Wednesday's close of 158.50 yen in
Tokyo.
   A handful of European central banks, led by the West
German central bank, moved to blunt the U.S. unit's advance
against the yen early in the New York session, selling
dollars for yen as the U.S. currency climbed well above 158
yen.
   But currency dealers said yesterday's intervention, like
Monday's central-bank performance, was little more than a
symbolic effort.
   Some estimated that no more than $100 million was sold on
behalf of the Bank of Japan. The Bank of Japan staged its own
small-scale intervention earlier in the day, with little
effect.
   To some dealers, the conspicuous absence of the Federal
Reserve from yesterday's dollar sales offered further proof
that the U.S. is reluctant to prop up the Japanese currency
while Japan refrains from raising interest rates.
   On Saturday, the G-7 ministers -- representatives from the
U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada
-- met in Paris. They said the yen's decline against the
dollar and European currencies would have "undesirable
consequences" for the world economy.
   Since then, market debate has focused on whether the major
industrial democracies are prepared to aggressively support
the Japanese currency.
   Earl I. Johnson, with Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in
Chicago, said that the impression persists in the market that
the G-7 isn't eager to stage an all-out campaign to halt the
yen's decline.
   "It's apparent there's no G-7 pact to support yen," he
added.
   For some participants, the mark's movements against the
yen were the main focus of the day.
   In Tokyo, the mark climbed to 94.71 yen from 93.39 yen
late Tuesday and finished the New York day at 94.46 yen,
compared to 94.08 yen a day earlier.
   "The phenomenon is the mark's rise against the yen more
than the dollar-yen" rate, and "the trend is clearly a
continued strengthening of the mark against the yen," Scott
Greene, chief dealer at Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co., said.
   Talk has crept into the market that Japan might move to
raise interest rates this weekend. But, according to Mr.
Greene, while a rate boost might temporarily strengthen the
yen, any recovery would be short-lived.
   The market has already factored such a move into trading,
Mr. Greene said.
   Japan last raised its discount rate in early March,
lifting it a full percentage point to 5.25%. The discount
rate is the central bank's base rate on loans to commercial
banks.
   Meanwhile, a more optimistic view of German monetary
unification has settled on the market recently, restoring
some of the mark's vigor.
   But traders said that a new mark bullishness hasn't yet
taken hold. They caution that key details of the monetary
merger still aren't worked out.
   Sterling is suffering another periodic bout of weakness,
with some players nervously bailing out ahead of the release
today of Britain's inflation data for March and unemployment
figures for February.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $374.30 an ounce, down 70 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate 2.5 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong, gold opened Thursday at $375.15 an ounce.

   Whose Mainstream?

   The Civil Rights Act of 1990, which would expand the
ability of workers to sue their employers on the basis of
discrimination, deserves more discussion than it is now
receiving. It might be more appropriate to say that civil
rights itself deserves more discussion. Shortly after the
Senate Judiciary Committee voted 12 to 1 recently to confirm
Clarence Thomas's nomination to be a federal appeals judge, a
Journal reader wrote to ask whether Senator Howard
Metzenbaum's lone vote against Mr. Thomas, who is black,
meant that it is Mr. Metzenbaum who is now "outside the
mainstream." The reader raises an important question. Who
indeed represents the civil-rights mainstream now?
   To the extent there has been any public discussion of this
issue, it has centered in the activities of the Judiciary
Committee, most prominently in the Supreme Court nomination
hearings for Robert Bork. This debate, however, began to cut
closer to the bone with the committee's nomination hearings
on a Justice department civil-rights job for William Lucas,
who is a black conservative. The committee voted down his
nomination, arguing that Mr. Lucas lacked competence to be
the department's civil-rights head. Mr. Lucas was raised in
Harlem and had been elected executive of Wayne County,
Michigan. It came out in the hearings that Mr. Lucas didn't
unquestioningly share the committee majority's opinion of
what constituted mainstream civil-rights policy. And we began
editorializing that the committee's Democrats were running a
Liberal Plantation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It next became clear that the committee would try to
oppose the judicial nomination of Mr. Thomas, raised in rural
Georgia, a graduate of Yale Law School and Ronald Reagan's
director of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Achievement-oriented, Mr. Thomas says he dislikes the "racism
of sympathy."
   The view we expressed at the time was that the committee's
liberals and their allies were attempting to ostracize from
public life black men and women who didn't share their
"mainstream" views. In the event, the notion that Mr. Thomas
should be kept off the federal bench was too indefensible to
pursue in public view, and he now is rendering decisions for
the Washington, D.C., circuit.
   The Thomas nomination was important. It established that
one side of this debate would not be able to use its
political authority and public-relations skills to intimidate
the other side into silence. Not that this is ever likely in
a healthy political democracy. Inevitably, other voices in
the civil-rights debate would emerge.
   Clarence Thomas and William Lucas are among those voices.
Others now include the economist Thomas Sowell,
tenant-ownership advocate Robert Woodson, and Kevin
Pritchett, the Virginia-born editor of the Dartmouth Review
in Hanover, N.H. Virginia has just elected a black Democrat
named Douglas Wilder who calls his centrist political
philosophy the "new mainstream." New York City's new mayor,
David Dinkins, conducted an inclusive campaign that won
support across racial lines. Time Warner has just announced a
new magazine, with the telling name Emerge, which will be
targeted at the black middle class. Several prime-time TV
series now feature vibrant and successful middle-class black
characters; indeed one's called "Family Matters."
   Some of these new voices flatly oppose affirmative action;
others would place less emphasis on blunt legal coercion to
advance black interests. Bill Lucas supports set-asides.
While one finds great diversity of opinion on the needs of
black America among these people, the so-called mainstream
views of the seven white men seated to the left of Judiciary
Chairman Joseph Biden all tend to flow in only one direction.
   The legislation now before Congress has arrogated to
itself the title Civil Rights Act of 1990. To dispute its
provisions or even vote against it is to risk being described
as against . . . against what? An opponent of this bill might
still support the notion that an employer should diversify
its work force with conscious and voluntary affirmative
employment of blacks or Hispanics or women.
   But surely one is in no sense opposed to civil rights if
one argues that it is wrong for a bill to create large
financial incentives to win punitive damages by filing
lawsuits and "disparate impact" cases against American
institutions. It is wrong because it puts the Congress of the
United States on record as saying that the nation's people
are by instinct and by nature racist. It says that their
racism is persistent and irredeemable, and that only the
efforts of lawyers and the judgments of courts will establish
an acceptable moral order in the U.S.
   This is indeed what some voices in American political life
assert. Do they represent the mainstream? Or is it possible
that the U.S. is more likely to achieve its civil-rights
goals without the polarizing litigiousness of this
legislation? Perhaps it is possible that the mainstream is
much wider than Senators Kennedy and Metzenbaum will allow,
that it now includes businesses, colleges and communities
determined, despite opposition, to draw more Americans into
the mainstream of middle-class achievement.

   We commend you for your special supplement on the 1990
census (March 9), but would like to call your attention to
the fact that "Census '90" virtually ignored the minority
communities in this country and the issues they face in the
coming census. While these issues most directly affect
Hispanics, African-Americans and Asian-Americans, they also
will greatly affect the general public once the counting is
done.
   Major problems include undercounting of the Hispanic
community and other minority groups, an insufficient number
of Hispanic enumerators to go into those communities where
Hispanics will be missed, and the lack of an outreach program
by the U.S. Census Bureau. As a result, Hispanics and other
minorities will once again face an undercount. An undercount
in the census means decreased political power and fewer
federal dollars going into communities across the country.

   I was fascinated by your observation in "Census '90" that
"computer whizzes have flourished in this statistical
hothouse." Exactly a century ago, inventor Herman Hollerith
saved the 1890 census from disaster and in doing so spawned a
revolution in data processing. In 1880, the Census Office had
been overwhelmed. It took seven to eight years to produce
detailed reports by largely manual methods. If nothing were
done by 1890, one census might overlap another and the whole
process fall into chaos. Fortunately, Hollerith's
punched-card tabulation system, developed for the 1890
census, saved the day.
   Employing the first practical data-processing system, the
Census Office completed tabulating most of the 1890 census in
only two to three years, although Hollerith's system was used
only for the population portion of the job. For the first
time, it had been possible to draw every possible combination
of data from the census schedules. And the machines saved the
Census Office $5 million in labor costs.
   Hollerith's punched-card machines made quite a hit with
industry, too. By the time he sold his Tabulating Machine Co.
in 1911, Hollerith's firm had about 100 commercial customers.
His firm was merged with several others making butcher
scales, time clocks and coffee grinders. In 1924, the new
company changed its name to IBM.
   Witnessing Hollerith's machines at work in the 1890
census, journalist T.C. Martin noted, "The apparatus works as
unerringly as the mills of the Gods, but beats them hollow as
to speed."

   Bonds Gyrate With Oil Prices, End Unchanged

   NEW YORK -- Bonds gyrated with the price of oil before
ending unchanged to modestly higher.
   "It was the first time in a long time that the bond market
tracked oil," said Kevin Flanagan, money-market economist at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the bond market always has some concern about the
inflationary implications of oil prices, it was the gyration
in energy prices that caught the market's attention.
   Bond prices reached their peak levels of the day when oil
prices slumped. When oil prices later reversed direction and
recouped those losses, bond-price gains were trimmed.
   Traders said the erratic energy markets held center stage
because there were few other developments to focus on during
the last full trading day of the week. Most bond trading
desks will close at 2 p.m. EDT today and will remain closed
through tomorrow in observance of Good Friday.
   The Treasury's sale of $7.52 billion of new seven-year
notes went "as advertised," according to one trader. The
8.62% average yield was in line with expectations. However,
dealers and analysts said there was some disappointment that
institutional investors and the Japanese didn't show much
interest.
   The bulk of the issue was bought by Wall Street dealers
for their own accounts, especially arbitrage desks, which
purchased the new seven-year notes while selling other
securities.
   In trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended
nearly 1/4 point higher, a gain of about $2.50 for a bond
with a $1,000 face amount. In when-issued trading, the new
seven-year notes were quoted at a yield of 8.63%, down from
8.64% immediately after the results were announced.
   The mortgage-backed securities market received some
bearish news from Lewis Ranieri, one of the market's founders
who is chairman of Hyperion Capital Management Inc.
   In a speech to institutional investors, Mr. Ranieri said
the government's bailout of the thrift industry could result
in huge sales of mortgage-backed securities. He noted that
the Resolution Trust Corp., the government's conservator for
insolvent thrifts, now has about $185 billion in assets and
so far has sold very little.
   Mr. Ranieri said most of the assets, which are whole loans
and not securities, will be packaged into mortgage securities
as thrift liquidations proceed. He estimates that the RTC
could sell between $60 billion to $70 billion of mortgages in
the next six months and a total of $100 billion over the next
18 months.
   Based on the speed at which the government is seizing
troubled savings and loans, Mr. Ranieri said about half of
the $500 billion of mortgage securities currently in thrift
portfolios could be sold over the next five years. The added
supply, he said, could expand the size of the mortgage-backed
securities market by 100%.
                                                                                                       

   Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Prices of junk bonds, or high-yielding, speculative-grade
securities, were mixed in trading that was driven by rumors.
   The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. surged on talk that
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. was snapping up the bonds.
   But R.H. Macy &amp; Co. bonds got clobbered on reports that
one Wall Street firm was short-selling the bonds.
   A spokesman at RJR, which is controlled by KKR, declined
to comment on the speculation.
   But dealers named Los Angeles-based Jefferies &amp; Co. as a
major buyer of RJR bonds yesterday. David Feinman, a junk
bond trader at Jefferies, said the firm was "both a buyer and
seller of the {RJR} securities." Mr. Feinman declined to
comment on whether the firm was buying the securities for
KKR, saying only that the firm handled trades in RJR
securities "for a variety of customers."
   Other traders said the buying by Jefferies caused other
dealers to scramble to cover short sale positions. In a short
sale, dealers sell borrowed securities and later seek to make
a profit by buying the securities back at a lower price.
   RJR's 13.71% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, due in
2009, finished up 3 3/4 points at 81 1/4 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The other widely held RJR issue, the 13.71%
exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, ended
4 3/4 points higher at 68 3/4.
   RJR pay-in-kind bonds have been volatile for several
weeks, falling on concerns that the coupon on the bonds would
be reset at more than 20% and rising on speculation that the
company will either launch a tender offer for the pay-in-kind
issues or exchange them for a new security plus cash or
equity or both.
   Macy's 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures due in 1998
fell two points to 75 while its 14 1/2% subordinated
debentures due in 2001 were off two points at 62.
   Merrill Lynch Capital Markets was rumored to be
short-selling Macy bonds to hedge a long position in Ames
Department Stores Inc. Bonds of Ames Department Stores
plunged nine points Tuesday on news about the company's
distressed financial condition. A Merrill spokesman declined
to comment on the rumors.
   Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said credit
rating downgrades of U.S. corporations outpaced upgrades by
four to one in the first quarter. Moody's said ratings of 95
corporations representing about $75 billion of long-term debt
were lowered, and ratings of 23 corporate issuers
representing $26 billion of debt were upgraded.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of
99 4/32 to yield 8.57%, compared with 98 30/32 to yield 8.59%
on Tuesday. The latest 10-year notes ended at 99 5/32 to
yield 8.61%, compared with 99 2/32 to yield 8.63%.
   Short-term rates were slightly lower. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills was 7.76% for a bond-equivalent
yield of 8.00%, while the rate on six-month Treasury bills
was 7.76% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.17%.
   The Treasury's seven-year note auction attracted the
largest amount of individual investor buying at such a sale
since last April. The reason was the relatively high yield.
   The 8.62% average yield on the notes was up from 8.02% at
the previous seven-year note auction on Jan. 10 and was the
highest since 9.39% on April 12, 1989.
   The robust buying by individual investors, however, didn't
totally offset the lack of interest by institutions.
   Here are auction details:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   The notes are dated April 16 and will mature April 15,
1997.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   The $2.9 billion of Franklin Savings Association
zero-coupon mortgage securities that were the subject of the
recent decision by the Resolution Trust Corp. regarding
post-insolvency interest are trading at close to their
accreted value because of investor concerns about an early
call.
   The $800 million of bonds due in 2014 trade at 6 1/4; the
$1.6 billion of bonds due in 2019 at about 4; and the $500
million of bonds due in 2024 at roughly 2 1/2, according to
one trader.
   These prices are slightly above their accreted values
based on the yields of about 12% at the pricing in 1984, but
the prices are down several points from levels before
Franklin Savings' troubles emerged earlier this year. The
institution is being operated under the conservatorship of
the RTC after being seized in mid-February.
   Zero-coupon bonds are sold at a deep discount to face
value. The bonds then accrete, or slowly rise in value, until
they reach their full face value at maturity.
   The current price of the Franklin zero-coupon securities
is a reflection of the investor belief that the bonds will be
called.
   In trading yesterday, most mortgage securities rose as
much as 1/8 point.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Japanese government bonds weakened as short-term interest
rates and the value of the dollar rose.
   In morning trading, the Bank of Japan bought 300 billion
yen ($1.9 billion) of overnight commercial paper at 7%. Prior
to this purchase and since the last discount rate rise on
March 20, the central bank has bought commercial paper three
times, once at 6.84% and twice at 6.88%.
   Dealers said the increase in the rate at which the central
bank bought commercial paper seems to indicate that the Bank
of Japan is willing to let short-term rates go higher, thus
making long-term debt with a lower rate a less-attractive
investment.
   Rates on new three-month certificates of deposit were
7.5%, up from 7.45% on Tuesday. The price of Japan's
benchmark 10-year bond fell 0.28 to 86.23 to yield 7.31%.
   Meanwhile, Canadian bonds rose between 3/8 and 3/4 point
on improved sentiment. Traders said the better tone is an
indication that investors believe rates have stabilized, at
least for now, after rising for the past three weeks.
   British bonds ended moderately lower after a seesaw day,
as participants awaited today's release of several key
economic indicators, including the March retail sales and
employment reports. Britain's 11 3/4% benchmark bond due
2003/2007 fell 1/4 to 97 28/32 to yield 12.04%.
   West German bonds ended stronger with the value of the
mark, but trading was lifeless. Bonn's benchmark 10-year bond
rose 0.38 to 94.30 to yield 8.63%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues were unchanged to 1/8 point higher in
late trading, having barely budged.
   What little life there was in the market was in the
new-issue arena, where $187 million of new debt was priced.
   Underwriters led by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. reported
an unsold balance of about $46 million for $119 million of
Baltimore County consolidated public improvement bonds and
metropolitan district bonds.
   Meanwhile, an unsold balance of about $23.2 million
remained for $68 million of Dallas limited tax bonds, won by
a Prudential-Bache Capital Funding group.
   Looking ahead, $53 million of Milwaukee general obligation
corporate purpose bonds will be priced via competitive bid
today. No large negotiated issues are expected to be priced
today.
   Among actively traded bonds, New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was unchanged at 97 3/8 bid
to yield 7.40%.

   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- As soon as the anesthesia
takes effect, the technician sets to work on the patient.
This is surgery most delicate. A falcon's broken beak is
about to be mended.
   The accident happened as the bird ripped into its prey;
its beak hit bone, and cracked. Not long ago, the injury
might have been fatal. But thanks to a veterinary technician
equipped with a tube of epoxy glue and an electric sander,
the proud and stately bird will hunt again.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the hungry years before shotguns and oil gushers,
Bedouins on the Arabian peninsula relied on falcons to hunt
food for the nightly campfire. Now, falconry is less a means
of subsistence than a sport for the rich. "Falconing is in
our blood," Mahmoud Farouk says as he extends a
leather-gloved arm to receive his falcon, which had been
treated for worms. "Getting back to the desert keeps us in
touch with our traditions and gives us peace of mind."
   Lots of money is lavished on the sport in these fabulously
wealthy sheikdoms. And as prices for falcons soar well into
the thousands of dollars, owners want the best medical
treatment for their birds. Which is how Cheryl and David
Remple of Laramie, Wyoming, found themselves on the edge of
the desert operating one of the most advanced avian hospitals
in the world.
   Until 1983, the couple had a veterinary practice back home
in Wyoming. Then one day, a phone call came from Dubai,
asking if the pair would set up a falcon hospital for Sheik
Hamdan Maktoum, a member of Dubai's ruling family and an
ardent falconer. Mr. Remple's efforts to save the endangered
peregrine in the U.S. had won high regard in the world of
falconry, even in far-off Dubai.
   "We didn't even know where Dubai was," recalls Ms. Remple,
43, a veterinary technician. But they knew falcons. Her
48-year-old husband, a veterinarian, has been a falconer
since he was 14. On their first date, "David took me to get
pigeons in some verminous old barn," Ms. Remple recalls. Live
pigeons are used to lure back a falcon tempted to fly off to
freedom during a hunt.
   The couple initially agreed to come for six months as "a
lovely lark," says Ms. Remple. When the sheik asked them to
stay on, the combination of a pleasant ambiance and a virtual
blank check for research and clinical practice proved
irresistable.
   During the hunting season, which lasts until late winter,
Dubai Falcon Hospital is bustling. Falconers bring in birds
for checkups before departing for camping parties on the
rolling deserts of Iran and Pakistan, where game is
plentiful. White-robed men, hooded birds perched on their
arms, trade tales of the hunt while waiting for their birds
to be examined.
   As many as 1,000 birds a year are treated here in a series
of low-slung bougainvillea-covered bungalows. Regular
patients have a microchip inserted in a breast muscle. The
chip electronically transmits a code that ensures birds will
be correctly identified and their medical records can be
consulted.
   Cases range from the trivial to the life-threatening.
Masked and gowned, Dr. Remple operates on a falcon suffering
from lead poisoning. Its owner inadvertently had fed the
falcon doves peppered with shot pellets. The bird will be
back on its perch tomorrow, and ready to hunt in a week.
   Meanwhile, Clayton Smith, a veterinary technician
recruited from Montana, pores over selections in the "feather
library." Falcons dive on prey at speeds of up to 200 miles
per hour; a single broken feather can impede performance. So
the hospital stocks hundreds of spares, gathered during
molting season and graded by size. Mr. Smith will insert a
tiny splinter of bamboo into the quill, and glue the new
feather into place.
   Passive on the arm but a terror in the sky, the falcon has
long inspired awe. The Hittites trained falcons as early as
the 13th century B.C. In medieval Europe, a rigid hierarchy
governed the sport. The king flew the imperious peregrine;
the holy-water attendant flew the sparrow hawk.
   Even the Koran speaks of falconry. Eat freely "that which
you have taught the birds and beasts of prey to catch,
training them as Allah has taught you," it says. The sacred
book of the Moslems also instructs falconers to say "In the
name of Allah" when releasing a bird to hunt.
   In the U.S., the sport is so tightly regulated that Dr.
Remple needed a briefcase to carry all the hunting permits.
In Arabia, anyone who can catch or buy a falcon is free to do
so. But the sport is dominated by the well-to-do, whose
hunting parties in the desert can last more than a month. One
sheik is so enamored of the sport that he had a bed made in
the shape of a falcon's foot, Dr. Remple says. One talon
mechanically uncurls to become a staircase to the sleeping
platform; another talon holds a television console.
   Until a few years ago, falconry was a seasonal pastime.
Because the birds couldn't survive the scorching summers,
Bedouins set their falcons free in late winter to join the
migration to cooler climates in Africa. Now, some sportsmen
have airconditioned flypens for their birds.
   Because of the falcon's migratory breeding habits, few
owners learned to tell male from female. The powerfully-built
peregrine, or "shaheen", was assumed to be male. Shaheen, in
fact, is a popular boy's name. The hospital's bulletin board
breaks the news discreetly with a snapshot of a mighty
shaheen labeled with the medical symbol for woman. Beside the
bird is its tiny mate, identified as the male.
   In treating birds, the Remples have had to confront some
strong Islamic traditions. Western falconers adhere to the
practice of painlessly ending the life of a hopelessly ill or
injured bird. Here, such birds are set free "to the will of
Allah." Fortunately, the Remples say, 96% of their patients
had full recoveries last year.
   Late in the day, when the air cools and the desert glare
softens, the Remples drive their falcons to the rim of the
Empty Quarter, a vast sea of sand that extends into the heart
of Arabia. The skyline is studded with minarets. From the
mosques comes the melodic call to sunset prayer.
   Ms. Remple releases her bird's jesses, the little leashes
that secure it to its perch. The bird soars off and turns in
its first slow circle. Not far away, a Bedouin exercising his
racing camel pauses to watch.
   The falcon wheels above a thorny acacia tree. Ms. Remple
hoots to startle the birds perched there. They rise, and the
falcon swoops at breakneck speed toward its prey. It falls on
a small partridge, and the two birds tumble from the sky, a
roiling ball of feathers. It is over in seconds.
   While the falcon gnaws on its kill, Ms. Remple moves in
slowly to re-attach the jesses, offering a morsel of skinned
quail as a reward. This is the falconer's trickiest moment; a
sated bird may fly away, never to be recaptured. According to
local news reports, that was the case recently in an outdoor
market in Saudi Arabia, where a falconer struck a deal to buy
a bird for $1,332. Just as he finished writing the check, the
bird snatched it up in its beak and flew off, leaving buyer
and seller cursing the sky -- and each other.
   But today, there are no such problems. As the couple
bounces back to town in their four-wheel-drive vehicle, the

   As They Said in Tokyo, `Kutubare GNP]'

   I learned recently that the average American spends seven
hours a day watching television. Trying to do my share, I was
flicking my remote control the other day when I lit upon a
hearing before the Joint Economic Committee. The chairman,
Rep. Lee Hamilton, is interrogating Richard Darman, director
of the Office of Management and Budget. He asks Mr. Darman
his opinion of the various ingredients in Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski's proposal for balancing the budget. As Mr.
Hamilton lists each proposal for a tax increase Mr. Darman
looks at it, sniffs it, bites it, and then rejects it,
saying, "Not sufficiently pro-growth."
   That kind of thing can occupy a couch potato for only so
long, so I flick again and find Michael Boskin, chairman of
the Council of Economic Advisers, explaining to the Senate
Finance Committee that the reason to cut the capital-gains
tax is to promote growth.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Flick again, and there is John Sununu, the president's
chief of staff, telling Judy Woodruff that the reason some
people want a stronger environmental program than he does is
that they are "anti-growth."
   So I had to find out what has made "growth" the acid test
by which all policies are judged. I turned to holy writ, the
Economic Report of the President, and there it was, on the
first page:
   "The primary economic goal of my Administration is to
achieve the highest possible rate of sustainable economic
growth. Achieving this goal will require action on many
fronts -- but it will permit progress on many more. Growth is
the key to raising living standards, to leaving a legacy of
prosperity for our children, to uplifting those most in need,
and to maintaining America's leadership in the world."
   That is pretty strong stuff. Growth is not just "a" goal
or "an important" goal; it is the "primary" goal. And the
goal is not just a high rate of growth: It is the "highest
possible rate of sustainable growth." And growth is not just
"a" key to a lot of good things: It is "the" key.
   This could all be one grand tautology. "Economic goal"
could be defined so narrowly that it is identical with
economic growth, or "economic growth" could be defined so
broadly that it encompasses all good things. But while
committing tautology may not be an impeachable offense, I
prefer to believe that my president does not indulge in it.
   So it may be worthwhile trying to parse out this paragraph
on the assumption that it means something. If economic policy
can have consequences other than consequences for economic
growth, and if some of these other consequences may be good,
what does it mean to say that the highest possible rate of
economic growth is the "primary" goal? Specifically, does it
mean if Policy A yields more growth and less of some other
good thing than Policy B that Policy A is always to be
chosen?
   That would clearly be an absurd position. Taken literally,
it would mean that the tiniest addition to growth is to be
chosen at the sacrifice of no matter how much of some other
good thing. And the administration does not really mean that.
Following the paragraph I have just quoted, the president
lists the policies he proposes to achieve his goal. The first
is: "Reduce government borrowing by slowing the growth of
Federal spending while economic growth raises revenue until
the budget is balanced, and reduce the national debt
thereafter."
   But if that is a route to more growth, it is not the route
to the highest possible rate of growth. That would involve
not only slowing the growth of federal spending but also
sharply cutting expenditures for Social Security, Medicare,
aid to farmers, defense and other things in order to reduce
the deficit faster and get a bigger budget surplus. I suppose
the administration does not propose that because it is
unwilling to sacrifice some other objectives in order to get
the amount of additional growth that might result from doing
so. When you say that, however, the notion of the primacy of
the goal of the highest possible rate of economic growth
crumbles.
   The proposition that economic growth is "the key" to a lot
of good things, like "uplifting those most in need," is an
attempt to evade the consequences of the fact that there are
valuable objectives other than growth. I used to encounter
this proposition in its most outlandish form in argument
about the defense budget:
   A. A strong economy is the key to national security.
   B. Cutting defense expenditures will make the economy
stronger.
   C. Therefore, cutting defense expenditures is the key to
national security.
   The relevant question is whether devoting certain
resources to increasing economic growth is a more efficient
way of achieving the other objectives -- such as national
security or uplifting the poor -- than devoting the same
resources directly to those purposes. The answer to that will
surely depend on the particular objectives and resources
under consideration. I am sure that in the defense case,
spending more on defense did more for national security than
using the same amount of money to reduce the deficit or cut
taxes would have done. I believe that the same is true of
uplifting the poor and exercising international leadership.
At least, the question needs to be argued and the answer not
taken for granted, as tends to be done.
   I think the administration is saying that when it
encounters a choice between more growth and more of some
other objective it leans in the direction of favoring growth
more than someone else -- Congress or Democrats or previous
administrations. This is a legitimate preference, like
preferring not to eat broccoli. But it is also legitimate to
have a different preference. The quality of discussion would
be improved if the administration would clarify its choices.
   For example, the administration might say about the
capital-gains tax: "We recognize that a preferential rate for
capital gains violates the valuable principle of equity in
taxation, but we believe that the resulting gain in economic
growth is worth that sacrifice of principle." Or about the
environment it might say: "We recognize that the
environmental measures that others propose would make life
less short and nasty, but we prefer to sacrifice that gain
for the sake of more rapid economic growth." Then we could
talk about the quantities and values involved, instead of
dividing up into pro-growth and anti-growth factions.
   I suppose that anyone who reads between my lines can see
that I do not share the high priority the administration
asserts for rapid economic growth as a goal of government
policy. There are two reasons for that.
   First, as I look around at the American scene I cannot
believe that making gross national product grow faster, and
making the consumption of ordinary Americans grow faster,
which is where most of the GNP goes, is a very high
objective.
   Between 1970 and 1988 real GNP increased by two-thirds and
real per-capita consumption increased by 45%. But the
proportion of the population in poverty, by official
measures, did not decline. The underclass and the homeless
are, if not more numerous, more intrusive in our
consciousness and consciences. The quality of education is a
great concern. So are drugs and crime. Meanwhile we are
falling all over ourselves to cut the defense budget, on the
ground of economic necessity.
   Second, if the great majority of the American people feel
that improving their living standards and those of their
children is a high-priority objective, they have the means to
do much to achieve that objective without further involvement
of the federal government. They can work harder, save more
and get their children to study more.
   I do not agree with those who think that the government
should have no role in affecting economic growth. But the
objectives that people have less ability to achieve for
themselves deserve a higher priority in the government's
attention. This includes defense, helping to ensure
international political stability, environmental protection,
crime prevention, maintenance of equal treatment before the
law, provision of infrastructure, and provision of
opportunity for the very poor to lift themselves out of
poverty.
   In my opinion, we are too rich to go on measuring our
national life in billions of dollars of GNP. For the benefit
of the few readers of The Wall Street Journal who have not
learned the new language of finance, the title of this
article is a slogan popular in Japan in the 1970s. It means
"GNP Go to Hell]"

   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Aviation Administration said
Continental Airlines, a unit of Texas Air Corp., paid
$215,000 to settle charges of safety violations.
   The FAA uncovered the alleged problems during inspections
in a five-week period in October and November of 1988. The
series of inspections was one of the most intensive ever
conducted by the agency.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agency said the violations included operating a Boeing
Co. 727 in passenger service with an inoperative escape
slide, not repairing a cargo-hold heater on a DC10 within the
required period of time and failing to update the airline's
operations manual. The airline also improperly weighed an
aircraft, the FAA said.
   Continental, in paying the fine, didn't admit that the
violations occurred, the FAA said. The agency said the
airline responded quickly to remedy the problems.
   In Houston, a Continental spokesman said, "While we have
some technical differences on some of the FAA's findings,
we've agreed to the settlement in the interest of moving
ahead." He noted that the findings didn't involve any
safety-of-flight violations and called the settlement one of
the lowest in recent aviation inspections.

   TORONTO -- Harold Ballard, the 86-year-old cantankerous
majority-owner of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd., died yesterday
afternoon, renewing speculation about who will inherit
control of the company and its profitable National Hockey
League franchise.
   Mr. Ballard's 80% stake in Maple Leaf Gardens, which owns
the Toronto Maple Leafs, is currently valued at about 130
million Canadian dollars (US$111.2 million). The company said
a summary of Mr. Ballard's will and testament will be
released after disclosure to his family and others, but it
didn't indicate exactly when that will happen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Canada's two biggest beer companies, Molson Cos. and John
Labatt Ltd., have an interest in the provisions of Mr.
Ballard's will. Molson, which already owns the Montreal
Canadiens N.H.L. franchise, has an option to buy 20% of Mr.
Ballard's stake in Maple Leaf Gardens. Labatt is a partner in
an entertainment promotion concern owned in part by William
Ballard, Mr. Ballard's oldest son. William Ballard also
indirectly holds stock in Maple Leaf Gardens.
   Control of Maple Leaf Gardens could be complicated further
by any claim on Mr. Ballard's estate made by Yolanda Ballard,
56, his longtime companion. Mr. Ballard never married Ms.
Ballard, but she legally adopted his last name and claimed to
be his common-law wife. If an Ontario court rules that Ms.
Ballard was Harold Ballard's common-law wife, she could be
entitled to a portion of his estate.
   After several years of acrimony in his family, Mr. Ballard
recently reconciled with his two sons and his daughter. He
became seriously ill last January and had been in the
hospital since then for treatment of acute diabetes and heart
ailments. In February, a court in the province of Ontario
declared him incompetent to manage his affairs and he
subsequently was replaced as president of Maple Leaf Gardens.

   SPRING, Texas -- It's Saturday night, and streams of
revelers are handing their BMW and Coupe de Ville keys to
valet parkers in front of the imitation chateau columns
flanking the entrance to the Raveneaux Country Club.
   In keeping with the club's Napoleonic theme (Raveneaux
having been a favorite country retreat of the emperor and
Josephine), the main ballroom features a lifesize portrait of
the diminutive general over the stone fireplace. But there
all analogies to the French empire end.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A fortyish crowd dressed in bobbysocks and letter sweaters
competes in a Hula-Hoop contest and twists to "Hermann and
the Dearhearts." Some women lie down to do dance steps in the
air, drawing applause as their panties come into view. A
singer burps into his microphone, prompting a roar of
laughter.
   So this isn't the decorous dinner dance that typifies
social events at a Piping Rock, The Club of Brookline, or Los
Angeles Country Club. Raveneaux may be nouveau, but it's
thriving, especially with the baby-boom generation whose more
radical members once foreswore country clubs as the social
arm of the military-industrial complex.
   Country clubs are being swamped with applications, with
some, like the Glen View Club in Golf, Ill., and Belle Haven
Country Club in Alexandria, Va., going so far as to refuse
new applications until current rolls thin. The surge has
swelled the average wait for memberships at existing clubs to
five years, doubling from 1986, says the National Club
Association.
   Club membership rose 9.5% during the the 1980s -- after a
two-decade slump -- at 200 clubs surveyed recently by Pannell
Kerr Forster, an accounting firm. With space so limited at
the old-line clubs, a national building boom of new clubs is
under way.
   While their ambiance may lean toward Naugahyde and sock
hops rather than faded chintz, most have much in common with
their more staid predecessors, whose members "were the upper
class created by wealth from the industrial revolution in the
1880s," says Michael Ebner, a historian of the upper class at
Lake Forest College in Illinois. "They needed a refuge and
the reassurance of those without antagonistic feelings toward
riches."
   The ranks of country clubs had swelled to about 5,000 by
the 1920s, but hundreds closed during the Depression, when
many fortunes disappeared. The rising popularity of golf
during Dwight Eisenhower's presidency sparked a country club
resurgence curbed first by the social upheavals of the '60s
and then by economic uncertainties of the '70s. Now that
demand is strong again, even the newest clubs can afford to
be choosy.
   At Brookstone Golf &amp; Country Club in suburban Atlanta,
John McWilliams, a 32-year-old real estate developer,
straightens his tie before a get-acquainted dinner with Mary
Browning, the membership director. The club is just two years
old, yet its brochure claims a "time-honored tradition of
togetherness and camaraderie." Empty brass plaques await the
names of Brookstone's first golf and tennis champions. Its
newsletter is priming members for upper-class athletic
pursuits with a regular feature, "Croquet Term of the Month."
Halls are adorned with paintings of the palace gardens at
Versailles.
   In the mock-Edwardian dining room overlooking the croquet
course, Mr. McWilliams pops the question: "What are the
parameters for rejecting applicants?"
   "Gut feeling," says Ms. Browning, impeccably attired in a
black dress and white lace stockings.
   "Gut feeling?" he asks, lowering his voice close to a
whisper.
   "Yes," she answers firmly, her eyes fixed on his.
   Acceptance would mean "instant prestige," he says. Many of
Mr. McWilliams's friends want to apply, but he says some
can't afford the $15,000 initiation fee. "I have been
fortunate."
   Mr. McWilliams compliments the chef, the clubhouse and Ms.
Browning. Still, the dinner ends noncommittally. She plans to
play a few purely social holes of golf with him before making
her recommendation to the rest of Brookstone's five-member
admissions committee.
   "If he flunks with Mary Browning, he's toast," says James
L. Rhoden Jr., builder and owner of Brookstone. (As of this
writing, and after several rounds of golf, Mr. McWilliams
still isn't a member, though he is said to have made a
favorable impression.)
   Mr. Rhoden owns four clubs, and one such dinner soured at
the Indian Hills Country Club near Atlanta when the
prospective member haughtily snapped his fingers at a
waitress and ordered Glenfiddich Scotch. Informed that the
bar didn't stock that brand, he vowed it would when he became
a member. The membership committee nixed the applicant,
making sure that prophecy wouldn't come to pass.
   Ms. Browning, a professional who has screened new members
for eight other clubs in the past decade, says, "It has to be
invitation only, or we're just barkers at a carnival waving
people in." At many of the new clubs, a professional
membership consultant remains a member of the admissions
committee, as does the club owner, even after the club's
start-up phase.
   For many, membership in a country club is more than just a
status symbol: It truly is the fulfillment of the American
dream. Roger Thiltgen, the 38-year-old president of an oil
and gas concern in Houston, grew up on his family farm
outside Galena, Ill. Caddying at the local Dubuque Country
Club offered him an escape from shoveling the hog pen and
opened up new vistas. He dreamed of "bettering himself," he
says. Now, as a member of Raveneaux, he feels that dream has
been attained.
   For Tommy Lee, 39, a vice president of a Houston
biomedical concern, "country clubs were another world to me.
I come from a mediocre family background, at best." At the
Raveneaux sock hop, Mr. Lee proudly plays host at a table for
his boss and other friends.
   This sense of achievement may be especially strong for
members of minority groups traditionally excluded from the
old-line clubs, many of which remain conspicuously white and
Protestant. "We're establishing a new pecking order," says
Frank Martinez, a medical-equipment salesman who recently
paid $19,500 to join St. Ives Country Club near Atlanta. "I'm
a minority from the inner city of New York, so this is a big
deal to me," says Mr. Martinez.
   He recalls that his father, a New York bus driver, was
murdered while walking home from work in 1969. "Whatever I
have today, there were trials and tribulations to get here,"
he says.
   Although the new generation of country clubs insists it
doesn't discriminate on the basis of race or religion,
minorities remain underrepresented. Blacks, for example,
typically account for far less than 1% of total club
membership, and none were present when a reporter visited a
half-dozen clubs in the Kansas City, Houston and Atlanta
areas. During the party at Raveneaux near Houston, Mr. Lee
was complimented by one of his guests for playing on "the
last all-white" football team at the University of Texas; he
seemed embarrassed by the comment but said nothing.
   Some black leaders fear that the surge in country club
applicants, who are overwhelmingly white, represents a
retreat from integrated cities and workplaces. "Many people
are shunning the melting pot that promotes racial harmony,"
says Kelvin Perry, president of the Black Chamber of Commerce
in Kansas City. "This nation has spent much time and money on
desegregation programs, but a lot of people just haven't
bought into it."
   But the new club applicants include plenty of former
social activists who once marched against the Vietnam War and
campaigned for civil rights. "The club is a great place for
my kids. It replaces some school and municipal activities
that are overcrowded and run by people I don't know," says
Carter Harrison Jr., 42, a suburban Kansas City financial
consultant who campaigned for anti-war presidential candidate
Eugene McCarthy in 1968. He recently joined two country
clubs, Woodside Racquet Club and the Kansas City Country
Club. Back in the '60s, "I wouldn't have had anything to do
with this," he says.
   Tom McMillan, a lumbermill owner in Kansas City, has gone
from social activist to social climber. Eighteen years ago,
he was taking over the ROTC building at the University of
Vermont in protest, but now he takes his two children to the
Homestead Country Club, a modern, ranch-style club with 20
tennis courts, a big pool but no golf course. "In 1970, I
thought country clubs symbolized the effete establishment and
the Vietnam War machine," says the 36-year-old Mr. McMillan.
"But today, the club is a safe harbor for my family."
   Paula Chandler, 39, another Woodside member, says she
smoked pot and was arrested during peace demonstrations at
the University of Kansas 20 years ago. She once ridiculed the
country club crowd favored by her father, a plastic surgeon.
"But I've come full circle," says Ms. Chandler, who now
supervises a dating service. "Today, the club gives me a
sense of belonging and being with others of my kind."
   Her father, Allen Chandler, adds, "Her generation has
decided it's OK to be filthy capitalist swine like me."
   Still, some of the new clubs are catering to the
distinctive political and social values of the baby-boom
generation. Shadow Glen, a new $16 million club near Kansas
City, has recruited a state biologist to plant prairie grass
around the golf course and release flocks of ruffed grouse, a
species long absent from the area. "We're selling something
to people who were radicals. You can be a card-carrying
Sierra Club member and still appreciate this place," says
Charles Sunderland, a Shadow Glen official.
   At St. Ives Country Club near Atlanta, where the clubhouse
isn't even completed, management has organized a clothing
drive for the homeless and a Christmas fund-raiser for abused
children. "Many of our members grew up in a turbulent time,
wanting to do the right thing," says Suzanne Carmichael, St.
Ives's director.
   Many of the new applicants also view club membership as a
business proposition, even at clubs that bar conspicuous
displays of business papers in an effort to preserve a social
atmosphere. Mr. McMillan, the lumber-company owner, for
example, was urged to join Homestead by his bankers. "They
loaned me money to buy the company and suggested it pick up
the membership tab because it would be good for business," he
says.
   Jerry Carey, a Kansas City stockbroker, joined a club
after an experience at a restaurant in which he tipped a
maitre d' in advance to greet him by name during lunch with a
client the next day. "But the guy just looked right through
me," he says. "You never know who you'll sit down beside at a
public restaurant," he adds. "And at public tennis courts,
people wear all kinds of clothes and have bad manners."
   Laurel Cochennet, 32, an employee benefits consultant in
Kansas City, recently paid $26,000 to join a new club after
reading the names on its burgeoning rolls. "Many were from
companies I wanted to do business with," she says
matter-of-factly.
   Despite worries that overbuilding or a recession could
muzzle the club boom, demographics suggest demand will remain
strong. International Golf Management Inc., in Pebble Beach,
Calif., recently announced plans to build a dozen new
superprestige clubs at a cost approaching $50 million each,
with memberships that could trade much like stock.
   International Golf's members will all have to buy $150,000
of stock in the new company, and pay dues of at least $1,000
a month for "ultra-premier" surroundings, according to John
Killip, senior vice president of marketing. The clubs will
feature splits of champagne served at the tenth hole and a
clubhouse designed for workaholics -- complete with four
"boardrooms" for corporate directors' meetings.
   Taking the club boom full circle, International Golf is
aiming at the old-line club crowd, not the fun-loving
newcomers at places like Raveneaux. Says Mr. Killip: "Our
clubs are for traditionalists, gray people -- pretty boring
people."

   U.S. Undervalued
   Lincoln's Assets,

   WASHINGTON -- Regulators vastly undervalued Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan Association's loan portfolio and other
wide-ranging investments to back up their takeover of the
thrift, charged Charles Keating, the chairman of the thrift's
former parent.
   In testimony in Mr. Keating's legal battle to regain
control of Lincoln, attorneys for the Arizona executive
introduced federal documents showing that in an analysis of
how much it would cost to liquidate Lincoln, regulators
slashed the value of loans and investments by as much as 75%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The analysis, dated one week after the government seized
Lincoln and placed it in conservatorship last April 14,
suggested Lincoln's assets would be worth only $2.1 billion
if liquidated. Lincoln was carrying the assets on its books
at $5.2 billion.
   "It's absolutely arbitrary," John Lundin, an attorney for
Mr. Keating, said in an interview outside the federal
district courtroom here. "These big write-downs were done
only a week after the takeover."
   But an attorney for the government said the document
wasn't the regulators' final word on the value of Lincoln
assets. "It's just a first cut at the value," said James
Murphy in an interview. He said that regulators normally take
such a quick, broad-brush look at a thrift's value, writing
down assets by using "percentages that in the past they found
to be useful."
   Mr. Murphy said it wasn't until last August that the
regulators, after doing many appraisals of individual assets,
declared Lincoln insolvent and placed it in receivership,
wiping out the ownership interests of Mr. Keating and other
shareholders.
   Nevertheless, Judge Stanley Sporkin seemed surprised by
the big write-downs assumed by the document and asked
yesterday, as he did Tuesday, for testimony from the
government explaining its valuation. "You don't write down
50% of a mortgage portfolio," said Mr. Sporkin, a former
enforcement director at the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   The liquidation document said nonperforming mortgage
loans, or loans on which interest isn't being paid, totaled
$1.4 billion and assumed losses of $703 million on those
loans. Mr. Keating asserted that Lincoln's entire mortgage
portfolio, aside from $600 million in real estate loans to
Lincoln subsidiaries, totaled $1.4 billion and that only 3%
of that was 60 days late in payments.
   The document also assumed a 75% loss on Lincoln's
investment in certain subsidiaries such as hotels and
insurance companies, as well as stockholdings. Such
investments in so-called service corporations were written
down to $170 million by the regulators from the $700 million
Lincoln used. "It's an impossible number," Mr. Keating, who
is chairman of American Continental Corp., said of the
government's figure.
   Attorneys for Mr. Keating also released a memo showing
regulators were upset with Roger Clark, the executive they
had hired to run Lincoln after taking it over. Though Mr.
Clark was paid a $300,000 annual salary, the memo from the
government's managing agent for Lincoln said Mr. Clark had
"failed to perform" and wasn't taking part in running
Lincoln. Mr. Keating's attorneys said the memo showed that
Lincoln is being managed incompetently by the government.
Lawyers from the government argued the memo is irrelevant to
the case.
   A spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., whose
employees are overseeing Lincoln, said Mr. Clark was leaving
his post as Lincoln's chief executive officer today because
his one-year contract hasn't been renewed. Mr. Clark didn't
return calls seeking comment.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   New York and Others Seek to Force U.S.
   To Adjust Census in Counting Minorities

   New York City, joined by Los Angeles and Chicago, took
court action against the U.S. Commerce Department, which they
accused of reneging on an agreement to correct the Census
Bureau's undercounting of minorities.
   The bureau's undercounting, which is about five times
greater for minorities than for others, is a problem for many
cities and states because the census is used in calculating
federal aid and allotting congressional seats. New York City
claims undercounting in the 1980 census cost it $675 million
in federal aid over the past decade and the loss of at least
one congressional seat.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The cities and other parties concerned about the
undercounting sued the Commerce Department in 1988. Last
July, in what was widely seen as a victory for the cities,
the department agreed to develop guidelines for adjusting the
undercounting.
   But in a motion filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New
York City and other critics of the Census Bureau said the
department guidelines put politics ahead of accuracy.
   The guidelines were to be used to evaluate whether the
census would be more accurate if it were statistically
adjusted to make up for the undercounting. But attorneys for
New York said the guidelines amounted to a list of reasons
against adjusting the census count.
   "Just as you can't get blood from a stone, it appears
impossible to get a fair and full count from the Department
of Commerce," New York Mayor David Dinkins said in a
statement.
   Peter Zimroth, a former New York corporation counsel and
one of the attorneys handling the case, said, "The Commerce
Department has refused to promulgate standards for
determining which set of data, the adjusted or the unadjusted
census count, will be more accurate."
   New York's motion was joined by Dade County, Florida; the
state of California; New York state; the U.S. Conference of
Mayors; the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People; and the League of United Latin American
Citizens, among others.
   Commerce Department officials said they are prepared to
defend the guidelines in court. Michael Darby, undersecretary
for economic affairs, said, "The guidelines are designed to
ensure that we have the most accurate census possible and to
prevent manipulation of the census figures for political
purposes." The Census Bureau is part of the Commerce
Department.
   Mr. Zimroth, however, said the guidelines put a higher
premium on maintaining "an orderly transfer of political
power," including the shifts of congressional districts,
rather than on getting an accurate count. He said that under
the guidelines, the Commerce secretary would have the
discretion to reject use of the adjusted census count even if
it were found to be more accurate.
   The motion asks federal Judge Joseph McLaughlin to declare
the guidelines null and void and to declare that a
statistically adjusted census would be constitutional.

   FORFEITURE IS UPHELD for non-obscene materials in an
obscenity case.
   A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., said a lower
court could order the seizure of hundreds of legitimate
magazines and videotapes from a Virginia couple convicted of
racketeering for distributing obscene material.
   The decision, the first in the country to uphold the use
of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or
RICO, in an obscenity case, presents novel questions of First
Amendment rights. Attorneys for the couple, Dennis E. and
Barbara A. Pryba, of northern Virginia, said the ruling would
allow inventories from a chain of bookstores to be seized
under RICO if two or more items sold in any one store were
deemed obscene.
   The unanimous appellate ruling, written by Judge Robert F.
Chapman, equated distribution of obscene materials to drug
dealing under the federal racketeering statute, which was
amended in 1984 to help prosecutors combat obscenity. The
seizure of non-obscene materials protected by the First
Amendment was permissible, Judge Chapman wrote, because the
government established a connection between couple's
"ill-gotten gains" and the protected materials.
   "Obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment and a
convicted racketeer may not launder his dirty money by
investing it in materials that involve protected speech,"
Judge Chapman wrote.
   Mr. and Mrs. Pryba were convicted in 1987 of selling six
obscene magazines and four obscene videotapes. Each sale was
prosecuted as an individual act in furtherance of the
criminal enterprise. Only two such acts need be proved to
obtain a RICO conviction.
   The Prybas' chain of 12 video stores, with total sales of
$2 million in 1986, were shut down as a result, even though
they dealt mostly in general-release videotapes. The total
value of the obscene material at issue in the trial was
$105.30.
   The Prybas' attorney, Paul J. Cambria, an expert in
obscenity issues who has represented Hustler magazine
publisher Larry Flynt, promised an appeal to the Supreme
Court.

   TEXAS SUPREME COURT makes it harder to keep court records
secret.
   A new rule tentatively adopted by the court requires that
a public hearing be held on any proposal to keep settlements
and other case documents confidential.
   Whether court records should be sealed is a controversial
issue in civil damage litigation, especially in
product-liability cases. Corporate defendants contend that
opening settlement agreements and other information to the
public may unfairly expose trade secrets and would impair
their ability to ward off frivolous suits. Plaintiffs'
lawyers, on the other hand, contend that keeping records
secret prevents consumers from learning about hazardous
products and forces duplicative investigations in
product-liability suits.
   Under the new Texas rule, anyone proposing to seal court
records must show that a need exists to protect a
"substantial" interest and that the interest outweighs the
value of the information to public safety and health. This
tougher standard covers all papers filed with a court, but it
doesn't apply to documents attorneys turn up in the
fact-finding process prior to trial. The rule also sets some
limits on when settlements must be made public.
   Texas Supreme Court Judge Nathan Hecht said that he
expects the court to adopt the new rule Monday and that it
probably would take effect Sept. 1. The rule is one of
numerous civil procedure changes the court has been
considering. It previously approved a change that would allow
cameras into civil courtrooms under certain circumstances.
   Dane Harris, president of the Texas Association of
Business, said the rule would cause "needless exposure" of
sensitive and sometimes competitive company information. "We
just feel it's bad public policy," he said.

   LEGISLATORS CRITICIZE Justice Department anti-drug grants.
   A House Government Operations subcommittee has turned up
new problems with the department's state and local grant
program. The panel's investigation has found that about half
the money advertised as intended to spur innovation among
state and local agencies goes to such federal bureaucracies
as the Drug Enforcement Administration. Congress has
appropriated as much as $90 million for the grant program for
the year that began Oct. 1.
   The subcommittee also has questioned the Justice
Department's priorities in making grants. For example, the
government has allocated $2.7 million to assist a
public-service advertising campaign based on the cartoon
crime-fighting dog, "McGruff," according to a House staff
member. In contrast, the department allocated $100,000 for a
new grant category designed to encourage investigation of the
relationship between drug abuse and child prostitution,
teen-age runaways and child pornography.
   "In an age where violent crime has risen for five straight
years we are fighting a war on drugs with cartoon crime dogs.
I think it is time to ask some questions," the subcommittee's
chairman, Rep. Bob Wise (D., W.Va.), said.
   A Justice Department spokeswoman said all of the anti-drug
grant money ultimately benefits states and municipalities,
even if it is routed through federal agencies. "None of our
discretionary money is for the purpose of federal agencies to
enhance their capabilities," said the spokeswoman. As for the
"McGruff" grant, she said that Congress had specifically
earmarked at least $2.7 million for the National Crime
Prevention Council, the private organization that sponsors
the McGruff ads, among other educational messages.
   The subcommittee is scheduled to hold hearings next week
on the preliminary results of its investigation.

   TWO PLEAD GUILTY in scheme involving $4 billion in rigged
securities transactions.
   Jeffrey Feldman, 42, of Skillman, N.J., and Paul Foont,
51, of New York, pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the
U.S. through prearranged transactions in U.S. Treasury bills
and other government securities. Prosecutors said those
transactions generated fictitious tax losses of $140 million,
which were passed on to investors in the defendants' business
so that the investors could deduct those amounts on their tax
returns.
   The investments were made in a series of limited
partnerships known as the Cralin partnerships, the U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan said. The pleas were entered
last week in federal court.

   OFFICERS OF SOUTHERN AIR TRANSPORT, which has been linked
to the Central Intelligence Agency and the Iran-Contra
affair, lost a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by the family
of a co-pilot. A Dade County, Fla., jury found two current
officers and one former officer of the Miami-based company
guilty of gross negligence in the death of Phillip DeCenzo.
The jury awarded his family $10 million, ruling that the
officers failed to alert the co-pilot about an unapproved
control device on a plane, which crashed while taking off
from a Texas Air Force base in 1986. Charles W. Rice, an
attorney for the defendants, said he will try to get the
verdict set aside.

Stein, became partners at Jorden &amp; Schulte, which said the
additions will help build its international, corporate and

   France's Economy
   Gets Strong Grades
   In Report by OECD

   The French economy, shaking off its reputation for being
unpredictable and inflationary, won a glowing assessment in
the latest report by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.
   France has "surpassed expectations on many fronts," the
Paris-based economic institution said. "The French economy
could thus outperform the average of the other countries in
the OECD on both the inflation and growth fronts for the
first time since 1970." The OECD consists of the world's 24
major industrial economies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The OECD's accolade coincides with changing perceptions in
the investment community. Increasingly, France is seen to
offer a measure of both sizzle and stability: It can expect
healthy growth in the early 1990s but without succumbing to
the inflation virus that's currently sapping Britain and
threatening West Germany.
   The French economy should grow at a rate of 3.1% in 1990,
and 2.8% in 1991, with inflation kept well under control, the
report said. Moreover, this follows two years of growth of
greater than 3%. Political stability also is a hallmark these
days, with legislative elections not scheduled until 1993 and
a presidential vote until 1995.
   Among the major European economies, France looks
particularly strong. Britain is bracing for its inflation
rate to surge above 9% this spring, amid anemic growth
outside the oil sector. West Germany, Europe's economic
engine and its historic monetary anchor, faces disruptions
and considerable inflationary pressure from the pending
economic and monetary union with East Germany.
   According to the OECD, the recent international confidence
in the French franc stems largely from its participation in
the European Monetary System, which links currencies together
within set exchange-rate bands.
   Not everything is perfect in Paris. The OECD and
independent economists point to the continuing aftershocks
from a poor investment record over the past two decades,
which they say prevents French industry from taking full
advantage of new growth opportunities around Europe.
   Another danger sign is the shortage of skilled labor
despite relatively high unemployment of 9.4%. The OECD noted
that France created 500,000 jobs in the past two years, but
it worries that the increase will slow because of a lack of
qualified workers.
   For the future, the OECD recommended reform in tax and
social benefits policy. French social insurance costs eat up
the highest percentage of any major industrial country, 44%
of GNP compared with 30% in the United States and 37% in
Germany. Pension and health costs have risen particularly
fast in France.

   LEXINGTON, Mass. -- Raytheon Co. reported an 8.4% increase
in net income for the first quarter on a 7.3% revenue gain.
   The electronics, aircraft and missile manufacturer said
net income was $130.9 million, or $2 a share, compared with
$120.8 million, or $1.83 a share, for the 1989 first quarter.
Revenue rose to $2.23 billion from $2.07 billion.

   In a statement, Raytheon said its total order backlog grew
to $9.49 billion, including funded U.S. government orders of
$6.84 billion. Backlog at the close of last year's first
quarter was $8.88 billion, including a government-funded
backlog of $6.78 billion.
   Thomas L. Phillips, chairman and chief executive, said
that in the first quarter, the electronics segment,
Raytheon's largest, performed well, while the aircraft and
energy-services segments continued rapid profit growth and
all five business units remained profitable. "Raytheon
continues to grow on the strength of its diversified
government and commercial business base," Mr. Phillips said.
   The company also said that its Beech Aircraft unit enjoyed
higher sales and improved profit margins. During the quarter,
Raytheon's dividend was raised to 60 cents a share from 55
cents.

   PARIS -- Groupe Expansion S.A. said the capital base of
its controlling holding company, Ponex S.A., will be
strengthened when Dow Jones &amp; Co. and two European publishing
groups acquire minority interests in the French business
publications company.
   Ponex is to remain 50.2%-controlled by Expansion Chairman
Jean-Louis Servan-Schreiber. Dow Jones, the publisher of The
Wall Street Journal and other publications and information
services, will take a 16.3% interest in Ponex. Handelsblatt
of West Germany will have a 13% stake and the Prisa Group of
Spain will have a 5% shareholding. The remaining 15.5% is
owned by a group of Expansion managers and institutional
investors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Expansion said Dow Jones and Handelsblatt also will become
shareholders of Eurexpansion, a network of 30 European
financial and economic publications in 11 countries that was
set up by Expansion last autumn. Dow Jones will have a 15%
share in Eurexpansion, which remains 58% controlled by the
French group. Handelsblatt is taking a 20% interest.
   Including its new stakes, Dow Jones's cumulative
investment in Ponex, Groupe Expansion and Eurexpansion will
be about $20 million. Dow Jones had held a 14.5% direct stake
in Groupe Expansion. But part of that is being shifted to
Ponex, reducing Dow Jones's direct holding in Groupe
Expansion to about 7.5%.
   Mr. Servan-Schreiber confirmed that Groupe Expansion
probably will seek a listing on the Paris bourse some time in
1991. A decision will be made early next year, he said.

   Film: Ninja Turtles, From Sewers, Lure Kids
   ----

<LP>
   The most popular movie in America right now is a
children's picture called "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." In
its first 10 days of release, this action picture about the
four radioactively altered turtles who live in the sewers of
Manhattan, eat pizza and fight bad guys has grossed almost
$51 million, one of the biggest openings ever.
   I liked the movie's deliberately artificial netherworld
and found it to be less frightening than many other popular
children's movies. Less frightening, for example, than
"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," in which a microscopic child
lands in a bowl of cereal and is almost eaten by his father.
And I could appreciate the sentimental bond between the
turtles and their ninja master, a stern but kindly old rat
called Splinter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But for the most part I found the Mutant Ninja Turtle
experience a little like watching a film shot in a language I
don't speak: I got the drift but sensed I was missing
something, maybe everything. Unfamiliar with the comic book
and the cartoon show and the merchandise they have spawned, I
simply wasn't tuned into this '90s version of the Cabbage
Patch doll craze. Why do these teen turtles talk like Valley
Boys? Why are they named for Italian Renaissance painters?
   I decided to find some experts who could explain the
appeal of this mix of martial arts, Manichaean drama and
"film noir".
   First I checked with one of the more level-headed
seven-year-olds I know, Kirlene Caesar, a second-grader who
lives in Manhattan. Kirlene isn't a dedicated fan of the
Ninja Turtle animated television series. Still, she persuaded
an aunt to take her to the movie the day after it opened. She
pronounced the movie "very good." She elaborated: "Splinter
and the turtles have good moves and do good things. Shredder
{the bad guy} and his helpers do bad things."
   Looking very demure in a pale blue corduroy dress,
sneakers with glittery pink laces and white tights embossed
with teddy bears, Kirlene said she thought the fight scenes
were exciting though she almost missed one crucial battle. "I
was eating popcorn and tying my shoes," she explained. "I
wanted to see the fight because I wanted the turtles to win."
   There was tension, but not too much tension. "At the
beginning I was scared it was going to be scary, but it
wasn't," she said. "I was scared when Splinter was in jail. I
was scared he was going to die and he is one of my favorite
characters." Kirlene also found a role model in the character
of April O'Neil, the girl reporter saved by the Ninja
Turtles. "April was on TV and said, `Hey Raphael.' I want to
be on TV and say hi to my friends," said Kirlene.
   I was starting to understand, but felt it was wise to
check in with Kirlene's nonurban counterparts, to see how
they reacted to the grittiness, the fighting. So I called the
placid suburbs of Denver, Colo., and spoke to my niece Laura
Abrams, age 10, just back from learning the box step at her
cotillion dance lessons.
   "I loved it; it was really neat," said Laura. "I liked the
way the Mutant Turtles dressed."
   As it turned out, I'd stumbled into a Ninja Turtle
stronghold. Laura's entire family, including her parents and
two siblings, had seen the movie on opening day.
   Did Laura think the movie was violent? "Oh yes," she said.
"My brother Andrew's gotten much more violent since he's into
the turtles. He has swords and is always jumping on chairs
going, `Yah] Yah] Yah]'"
   Andrew, age four, offers some insight into why the Mutant
Ninja Turtles have become a multimillion-dollar industry even
though many parents, including his, are unnerved by their
vivid hand-to-foot combat. His current stock of Ninja Turtle
goods include underwear, a thermos bottle, a biker pack,
pajamas, two shirts, jujitsu gear and a couple of Ninja
Turtle dolls. He would own more of the plastic figures but
the toys are now scarce in Denver.
   Andrew's take on the movie? "I liked it when Michelangelo
went spinning around and when he cut up the pizza and it
landed on Splinter's head." As for April, the girl reporter:
"Yucko," said Andrew. "She doesn't even fight." Does he want
to see the movie again? "A new one," he said.
   Even Julie, Andrew's almost-14-year-old sister, has been
caught up in this Mutant Ninja madness. She's already checked
out the turtle movie twice. "These guys behind me, they've
seen it like three times," she reports. "They love it. These
girls I was with didn't like it at all because they didn't
understand it. They didn't have little brothers so they don't
know what ninjas are."
   Julie also suspects that the Ninja Turtles may inspire
aggressive behavior. Her evidence lies in a 13-year-old boy
acquaintance who likes the turtles so much he was given a
model sewer for his birthday. After he saw the movie, Julie
reports, he instigated a fight with her. "But I had a skirt

   "Crazy People," a movie about an adman who goes mad and
becomes very successful writing truthful slogans, may contain
some of the funniest advertising copy ever written.
Unfortunately, the satiric slogans are surrounded by a
sentimental and silly vision of life in the asylum. Dudley
Moore is convincingly daft as the advertising executive, and
Daryl Hannah continues to uncover a lovely comedic talent.
Better wait until this one is on video, so you can zap to the
commercials.

   VIDEO TIP: Turtles have been generally neglected
throughout film history. However, there is the delighfully
whimsical British film, "Turtle Diary," about two
turtle-obsessed adults. Glenda Jackson and Ben Kingsley are
swell as the eccentric author and the bookstore owner who
take it upon themselves to liberate the turtles trapped at
the local zoo.

   WASHINGTON -- The Federal National Mortgage Association
said first-quarter net income rose 67% to a record $277
million, or $1.06 a share.
   In the year-earlier period, Fannie Mae reported earnings
of $165 million, or 66 cents a share. The results reflected
increases in net interest income on Fannie Mae's portfolio,
income from guaranty fees on mortgage-backed securities, and
other income. At the end of the quarter, Fannie Mae's
portfolio totaled $123.64 billion and it had $246.39 billion
in mortgage-backed securities outstanding.

   The federally chartered, publicly traded corporation
operates a secondary market in home loans, buying mortgages
from lenders, packaging some into securities for sale to
investors and holding the rest in its portfolio. The company
said the latest results were its ninth consecutive quarter of
record profits.
   The results were "based on solid fundamentals," said
Chairman David Maxwell. "Our net interest margin was the
widest in history; we issued the largest volume of
mortgage-backed securities in any first quarter; and
properties acquired through foreclosures dropped to their
lowest level since peaking in 1987."
   Fannie Mae said that net interest income rose to $378.4
million from $253.1 million the year before, reflecting
increases in the average investment balance and the net
interest margin. Guaranty fees rose to $120.5 million from
$94.5 million.
   The provision for losses was $75 million, down from $80
million the year before. Charge-offs totaled $59 million in
the first period, up slightly from $58 million a year ago.
During the latest quarter, Fannie Mae acquired 2,455
properties through foreclosure, down from 2,975 in the 1989
quarter and 44% below the 1987 third-quarter peak.
   Administrative expenses rose to $66.3 million from $56.1
million in 1989. Federal income taxes nearly doubled to
$110.1 million from $56.8 million.
   Fannie Mae bought $5.7 billion of mortgages in the latest
quarter and sold $1 billion. That compares with purchases of
$3.4 billion the year before and sales of $1.8 billion. It
also said it issued $24.1 billion of mortgage-backed
securities in the latest period, compared with $14.4 billion
the year before.

   HICKSVILLE, N.Y. -- Newmark &amp; Lewis Inc., a New York-area
discount retailer of home appliances and electronics, said it
named Ron Fleisher, 43 years old, president and chief
operating officer, effective May 1.
   The appointment of Mr. Fleisher, who was president of the
Eastern region of Silo Inc., a national appliance and
electronics retailer, marks the first time Newmark &amp; Lewis
hired an outsider as president. The operating chief's post is
new; as president, Mr. Fleisher will succeed Richard Lewis,
66, who will become co-chairman with Warren Hyman, 68.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said Mr. Fleisher's hiring will permit Messrs.
Lewis and Hyman, who are also to be co-chief executive
officers, to spend more time on planning and strategic
growth.
   Mr. Fleisher's appointment is to coincide with Newmark &amp;
Lewis's anticipated addition of 17 stores it expects to
acquire for $7.8 million and the assumption of some
liabilities from Brick Church Appliance Inc., Edison, N.J.
Following that, Newmark &amp; Lewis will have a total of 67
stores.

ranging from Bach to Wagner to Sir Henry Bishop.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, April 15, 4-6 p.m. EDT, on ABC: "MacDonald's
All-American High School Basketball Game." Another talent
search for the nation's hottest high school players will
culminate in a game that also is a charitable fund-raiser --
this year's proceeds will go to institutions in the
Indianapolis area.
                                                                                                       

   Monday, April 16, 8-9:45 p.m. EDT, on TNT (repeated April
16, 17, 21 and 22): "The Rose and the Jackal." According to
this fictionalized version of Civil War history, Allan
Pinkerton (the founder of the American Secret Service and the
famous detective agency) fell in love with Rose O'Neal
Greenhow (a beautiful Confederate spy) while prosecuting her.
No one knows whether such a romance actually occurred. But
this wonderfully stirring film, starring Christopher Reeve
and Madolyn Smith Osborne, will make you wish it had.

lively film, produced with the cooperation of the NBA.

Earth." The return of Earth Day (April 22) doesn't
necessarily mean the return of 1960s-style environmentalism.
This film offers some hope that the problems can be addressed
in ways that move beyond reflexive anti-business attitudes.

three-part series "Earth" (each night, 8-9 p.m. EDT); and
"Where Have All the Dolphins Gone?" (Sunday 9-10 p.m. EDT).
ABC takes the concerned-celebrity route with an entertainment

   Friday, April 20, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: "Largo
Desolato." Written (appropriately enough) in 1984, this
gloomy but wry play by Vaclav Havel stars F. Murray Abraham
as a dissident Czech writer about to be interrogated by the
secret police. If it makes you curious about the playwright,
recently elected president of Czechoslovakia, stay tuned for
"Havel's Audience With History" (10:30-11:30 p.m. EDT), a
documentary that tries to capture the essence of two
different productions (one Czech, one American) of Havel's
best-known play, "The Audience," while also tracing his life
and character.
                                                                                                       

   Saturday, April 21, 10-11:30 p.m. EDT, on Showtime
(repeated April 26, May 2, 8 and 13): "Showtime Coast to
Coast: All Star Edition." Most popular-music specials on TV
are too packaged and categorized. The same cannot be said of
this smart, eclectic series, now launching its third season
with a post-Grammys jam session featuring B.B. King, Herbie
Hancock, Bonnie Raitt, Michael Bolton and Rickie Lee Jones,
among others.
                                                                                                       

   Sundays, April 22-May 20, 9-10 p.m. EDT (the first episode
is two hours long), on PBS: "Traffik." We Americans are so
accustomed to thinking about the drug crisis in terms of
cocaine, Central America and the U.S. that it comes as a
shock to see the same tragic scenario being played out in
terms of heroin, Pakistan and Europe. Few anti-drug films are
as starkly riveting as this Channel Four production filmed on
location in northwest Pakistan, Karachi, Hamburg and London.
More in Monday's column.
                                                                                                       

   Sunday, April 22, 10 p.m.-midnight EDT, on HBO (repeated
April 25, 30, May 3, 8 and 11): "The Investigation: Inside a
Terrorist Bombing." More starkly riveting stuff from the
British Isles. Only this time, the subject is the 1974 IRA
bombings that killed 21 people. This docudrama, starring John
Hurt and Martin Shaw, means to stir up controversy about the
guilt of those convicted, the so-called Birmingham Six.

   Peres's Failure to Form Israeli Coalition
   Puts Spotlight on Defense Chief Rabin

   The failure of Shimon Peres to form a government may have
dealt a lethal blow to the leadership hopes of the veteran
politician, even though Israel's president gave him an
additional 15 days to bring possible coalition partners into
line.
   It is Mr. Peres's Labor colleague, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, who is likely to benefit from Mr. Peres's
failure, rather than Likud-bloc leader Yitzhak Shamir.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the loser certainly is the Israeli political system,
which continues to crumble under the weight of too many small
parties, too many cynical deals and too little stability to
address the serious issues confronting the state.
   Mr. Shamir, who lost a parliamentary vote of confidence in
March, isn't any more likely to be able to break the 60-60
parliamentary deadlock than Mr. Peres. But Mr. Rabin, whose
more-hawkish stance may be more in tune with the current
Israeli temperament than Mr. Peres's dovishness, stands some
chance of being able to win the support of the small
religious parties whose backing now is crucial to the
formation of a coalition.
   Mr. Rabin has been waiting quietly in the wings, careful
to avoid appearing to undermine Mr. Peres. But he is known to
believe that Mr. Peres acted unwisely in bringing down Mr.
Shamir's government, misjudging the solidity of the religious
parties' support. While the Labor Party may be reluctant to
risk the internal schism of overthrowing its own leader, it
also may want to avoid facing an early election with a
weakened leader in charge.
   The unseemly political horse-trading of the past few weeks
has damaged Mr. Peres. His willingness to promise huge slices
of Israel's diminished financial pie to the ultra-religious
parties, and his sudden effusive speeches about religious
observance have antagonized secular Israelis, while making a
coalition deal with Avraham Sharir, a renegade former Likud
hard-liner, repelled others.
   Mr. Peres had little choice, as any coalition had to be
cobbled together from disparate and often antithetical
elements. The difficulty of the endeavor was demonstrated all
too clearly when the Knesset, or parliament, erupted in
pandemonium on the news that two hard-line religious-party
members had withdrawn their support from Mr. Peres after
promising it only hours earlier.
   President Chaim Herzog, in giving Mr. Peres an extension
to the three weeks he initially granted after last month's
no-confidence vote, said in a statement that the recent
political horse-trading raised "piercing questions about our
system of government and our political culture." In an
apparent reference to the need to overhaul Israel's
proportional representation system, which gives small parties
disproportionate power in coalition bargaining, the president
said Israel would eventually have to face these questions.
   Mr. Peres may yet manage to forge his fragile coalition if
the ultra-Orthodox Augudat Israel party replaces its two
defecting Knesset members, or brings them back to the current
party line in support of Mr. Peres. The two defectors oppose
trading land for peace.
   If he fails, Mr. Hertzog may call for an early election.
But "there are two arguments against it," says Shlomo
Avineri, professor of political science at Hebrew University.
"Everything, including the peace process, would be put on the
back burner. And the Soviet immigration, which now requires a
great national effort, and which many Israelis think is the
best thing that's happened for a long time," would suffer as
government planning stalled for the poll.
   If Labor turns to Mr. Rabin, options widen. Mr. Shamir has
ruled out serving in a national unity coalition under the
leadership of Mr. Peres, but Mr. Rabin may prove more
palatable to a majority of Likud members.
   The 67-year-old defense minister, like Messrs. Shamir and
Peres, is a familiar face to Israeli voters. As commander of
the Israeli defense forces during the Six-Day War, he won
kudos and was afterward appointed ambassador to the U.S. In
1973 he joined Golda Meir's government as labor minister and
on her resignation less than a year later narrowly defeated
Mr. Peres in a leadership ballot. In 1977, a scandal over his
wife's illegal U.S. bank account forced his resignation as
prime minister.
   He has held the defense portfolio since 1984, and while
bungling badly during the early days of the Palestinian
uprising, has recently experienced a rise in reputation
through his handling of negotiations with Cairo over plans
for Palestinian elections. To many Israelis, Mr. Rabin
bridges the gap between their perception of Mr. Peres as
likely to make a bad deal with the Arabs, and Mr. Shamir's
rigid reluctance to make any deal at all.

   The state of Washington's investment board has asked Exxon
Corp. to undergo an independent audit of all its facilities
and operations to determine if they are environmentally
sound.
   The request by the board, which owns or controls about 1.1
million of Exxon's 1.3 billion shares outstanding, is the
latest in a swelling chorus of complaints from major
shareholders about the oil company's recent string of
environmental catastrophes and management's response to them.
The most notable disaster was the 11 million gallon oil spill
caused when the Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground off
Alaska in March 1989. Exxon has indicated it expects to
eventually spend at least $2 billion on a cleanup.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a letter to Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl, investment
board chairman Joseph A. Dear said the spills and other
environmental problems have "imposed an extraordinary
financial burden" on holders. Mr. Dear said the "value of our
holdings could be jeopardized" if Exxon management doesn't
improve its environmental record. He called for the audit to
be completed by the next Exxon annual meeting.
   The board's action came in response to a proposal by State
Treasurer Dan Grimm. Noting that a lot of Exxon tankers ply
the Puget Sound and other state waters, Mr. Grimm said that
"if Exxon rejects this request {the state} will have no
choice but to consider other approaches to assuring the
safety of oil tanker operations in Washington waters." He
didn't elaborate.
   Exxon couldn't be reached to comment on the board's
proposal.

   What the Dissidents Wrote
   ----
   By Hilton Kramer
</HL>
<DATE>

</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12
</SO>
<LP>
   Few living writers in the West are as knowledgeable about
the history of the Soviet Union as Robert Conquest, and few
bring to the subject a literary sensibility that is a match
for his. This British-born historian poet, now a senior
research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution
and curator of its East European Collection, has written --
among much else -- three key works about the horrors of the
Stalin era. They are: "The Great Terror," a definitive
account of the purges of the 1930s; "Kolyma: The Arctic Death
Camps," a study of what were undoubtedly the most beastly
outposts of the Soviet gulag; and "The Harvest of Sorrow,"
which traces in unremitting detail the course of the
terror-famine that Stalin's collectivization campaign imposed
on the peasants of the Ukraine in the years 1929-33.
   While producing these histories and a good many other
works -- six volumes of poetry and a science-fiction novel
that he wrote with his friend Kingsley Amis -- Mr. Conquest
also has kept a sharp eye on the heroic efforts of the
dissident writers in the Soviet Union in the pre-glasnost era
to tell the truth about their country. Now he has published a
chronicle of his commentaries on these writers under the
title, "Tyrants and Typewriters: Communiques From the
Struggle for Truth" (Lexington Books, 208 pages, $19.95). The
book is not only an expert guide to the most distinguished of
the dissident writers -- Pasternak, Solzhenitsyn, Sakharov,
et al. -- but a persuasive account of the crucial role that
this dissident literature played in bringing about the
momentous changes that lately have occurred in Soviet
politics.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   About that role Mr. Conquest has long exhibited a
comprehension that, in retrospect, now looks like something
closer to prophetic vision. In 1972, for example, while so
many others were wallowing in the illusions of "detente" --
remember "detente"? -- Mr. Conquest wrote: "The dissident
movement is weak, and is faced with a political machine of
immense strength. But it constitutes a growing point for the
eventual peaceful, democratic Russia we must all hope for."
   Even earlier, in 1968, Mr. Conquest wrote about Andrei
Sakharov: "He shows that the system is morally and
intellectually bankrupt. It remains to be seen whether the
great revulsion of the Russian educated classes, who are
still almost powerless, will be able to translate itself into
political action." Again and again, Mr. Conquest was quick to
identify the political role of the dissident intelligentsia
in denuding the Soviet regime of the last vestiges of its
claim to legitimacy.
   Thus, writing about Alexander Solzhenitsyn's "Gulag
Archipelago" in 1974, he focused on the analysis that
horrified some American liberals at the time but that is
today the conventional wisdom in Moscow as well as New York.
"Solzhenitsyn," Mr. Conquest wrote, "does not put the blame
solely on Stalin and the `personality cult.' He traces the
long evolution of terror, showing that the labor camp system,
the frame-up trials, the mass shootings, the secret
disappearances -- all go back to early Soviet times. . . .
That is to say, a major aspect of Solzhenitsyn's book is that
it breaks totally with the myth that has corrupted and
deluded so many commentators on the Russian Revolution and
the Soviet system: the myth of the liberal Lenin."
   This may sound commonplace today, but some of us can
remember the howls of protest that Solzhenitsyn's critique
met with at the time. And we remember, too, with shame, the
refusal of a Republican president -- Gerald Ford -- to meet
with Solzhenitsyn at the White House, or anywhere else, for
fear of endangering the bogus policy of "detente."
   Even today, of course, long after Solzhenitsyn has been
proved right on so many aspects of the Soviet debacle, his
work continues to be shunned by American writers. Has any
member of the American literary establishment -- Norman
Mailer, say, or Susan Sontag or E.L. Doctorow -- ever come
forward to acknowledge Solzhenitsyn's towering achievement?
Certainly not. Solzhenitsyn does not belong to the literary
left, and therefore is not to be accorded the kind of honor
they used to routinely hand out to apologists for the Gulag
such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir.
   This, too, is part of the story that Mr. Conquest has
undertaken to tell. He naturally reserves his deepest
contempt for those Western writers who were, as he says,
"determined to be duped" about the realities of the Soviet
regime. But his chronicle of the West's intellectual response
to the Stalinist terror is by no means entirely a tale of
surrender to political illusion. There are excellent accounts
of Arthur Koestler's "Darkness at Noon" -- "one of a handful
of books which has powerfully affected the political,
intellectual and moral climate of our times," and of George
Orwell's "1984." He is particularly scathing about Walter
Cronkite's cockeyed introduction to the Signet edition of
"1984," which attempts -- against all the evidence -- to turn
the book into an attack on life in the capitalist West.
   In fact, it was Orwell who wrote in 1946: "It is too early
to say just in what way the Russian regime will destroy
itself. . . . But at any rate the Russian regime will either
democratize itself, or it will perish. The huge, invincible,
everlasting slave empire . . . will not be established, or,
if established, will not endure."
   In "Tyrants and Typewriters" Mr. Conquest has given us a
fine account of the writers who helped to bring down that
empire.

   Wine From the Czar's Table

   London -- Given the highly publicized tilt toward greed
now in the Soviet Union, few entrepreneurial schemes there
should surprise readers of this paper. But here is something
startling. Earlier this month, Sotheby's in London sold
13,000 bottles of Russian wine for more than $1 million.
   Sotheby's chairman, the Earl of Gowrie, told me he was
very pleased with the results, as the auctioneers had
predicted a total of only just over $800,000. Buyers included
many well-known wine merchants from both the East and West
Coasts of the U.S., Germany and Australia; but most of the
top prices -- especially for those bottles with a Czarist
provenance -- were paid by private buyers.

<TEXT>
   Russian wine does not have a good name. Few wine reference
books have a kind word to say about it, and some omit the
Soviet Union altogether, though its production of drinks such
as the saccharine Georgian ersatz "champanski" is large.
   Yet Sotheby's sold three bottles of superb Russian wine
that are 150 years old, and still very drinkable. These
bottles from the 1830s were made for the Czar of All the
Russias, from grapes grown in the area around the Imperial
Family's summer palace at Livadia, in the Crimea. They were
served at the czar's table, and also were used for royal
christenings and coronations. They were bought by Cherry
Ripe, a well-known Australian journalist, for $1,732, nearly
three times Sotheby's pre-sale estimate. (To my own taste,
this was the most attractive style of wine in the sale.)
   The wines -- some of which were original bottlings with
the imperial seal, the double-headed eagle, embossed in the
glass -- were consigned to Sotheby's for sale by the still
extant winery at Massandra, just outside Yalta in the Crimea.
The most expensive of these, three bottles of Livadia White
Port 1891, went for $4,223 a bottle to a Swiss buyer,
breaking the world-record price for vintage port. He also
bought the other two most expensive lots of the day.
   The sale was a triumph for Nikolai Boyko, the
worker-elected managing director of the Massandra winery, who
was in London for the event.
   Sotheby's wine expert, David Molyneux-Berry, had first
heard of the Massandra "Collection" (as the Soviets call it
themselves) 16 years ago, when he was actually shown a list
of some of the Massandra wines by one of those
hard-to-pin-down companies specializing in East-West trade
"arrangements." The Cyrillic letters were smudgy, the wine
sounded outlandish, nobody could explain how the wine would
be got out of the U.S.S.R., and the whole deal had the air of
a hoax.
   But then last year Sotheby's held a well-publicized and
financially successful sale of work by contemporary Soviet
painters in Moscow, and the Massandra Collection surfaced
again. This time the auction house was interested.
   Last October I visited the Massandra "factory" in the
Crimea myself, in company with Mr. Molyneux-Berry; Peter
Batkin, a wonderful, flamboyant Sotheby's man who is capable
of solving problems others find insoluble; and Sergei
Alekseyevich Alayeve, the general director of joint ventures
at the Ministry of Agriculture, who takes a close interest in
the fortunes of Massandra.
   Sergei Alekseyevich is New Gorbachev Man, totally
committed to economic and social reconstruction. The sort of
person who wants to wear good clothes and eat in good
restaurants, he also wants to extend these privileges to
every Soviet citizen. When he met Mr. Batkin, he knew he
could help put Massandra back on the map.
   The brief history of the winery is that it was founded
between 1894 and 1897 to supply the czar's summer place at
nearby Livadia. In fact wine had been made in the region
since the 1820s, when Count Mikhail Vorontsov, then said to
be the richest man in Russia, imported many French wine
varieties into the Crimea. His wine-making efforts at first
failed, as he was trying to imitate French table wines. In
the 1880s his interests were taken up by Prince Lev Golitzin,
who first tried to make "champagne," but finally realized
that the soil and climate were better suited to the
production of sweet dessert and fortified wines. (The current
wine-making team at Massandra claims, and Mr. Molyneux-Berry
agrees, that these types of wine, despite their copycat names
of "port," "sherry" and "Madeira," cannot be produced
anywhere in the world except on the south coast of the
Crimea.)
   Under Golitzin there began a dynasty of wine makers at
Massandra, starting with Aleksandr Yegorov, who lived to the
age of 95, having survived the 1917 Revolution and the
nationalization of the Massandra winery. He was under the
personal protection of Stalin's henchman Anastas Mikoyan,
then commissar for the food industry, who invited Yegorov to
return to take over Massandra in 1936, despite his
pre-revolutionary connection.
   His daughter Tatyana, also a wine maker and the second
member of the dynasty working at Massandra, had married an
aristocrat, Dmitri Rakovich, a colonel in one of the czar's
regiments and a fellow officer of the writer Lermontov.
Rakovich was shot by the secret police in 1937. His son is
the current wine maker of Massandra-Yuri Dmitrievich Yegorov,
who, following his father's execution, suppressed the
patronymic and took his mother's surname.
   Mikoyan extended the same protection to Yuri, and he
helped his grandfather evacuate the Massandra Collection in
the early part of 1941. The Nazis entered Yalta on Nov. 8,
but the Yegorovs had finished dispatching and hiding the
collection in three separate locations in the Soviet Union on
Sept. 21st. The 1941 vintage was still in vat; to keep it
from the Germans, they opened the taps and let it run out
into the Black Sea. Late in 1944 the Yegorovs began returning
the collection, and by the time of the Yalta Conference in
February 1945 it was back in place.
   The collection I saw now stands at more than a million
bottles, of which the youngest is 15 years old.
   Why did the workers' committee of Massandra want to sell
even this small (but historic) chunk of the vinous equivalent
of its crown jewels? One reason, Mr. Yegorov told me, was
simply to raise hard currency to improve their plant and
equipment. The other was to establish a pricing mechanism for
their seriously under-appreciated current wine production:
"The National Agricultural Industry doesn't take quality into
account when fixing prices. So apple wine costs the same as
our wine in the shops."
   Massandra faced the same problem that bedevils other
Soviet manufacturers of first-class goods: making the price
of its commodity equal its true value. The answer, thought
the people concerned at the winery, was to leap head-first
into capitalism, to export a small fraction of their best
wines by selling them at a public auction, conducted by the
world's most famous auctioneers, in London, the center of the
world wine trade.
   These bottles had survived the Revolution, World War II
and Stalin. Their sale was only a small gamble for brave
veterans of Massandra, but they must be pleasantly surprised
at the size of their winnings. It appears that for one very
atypical sector of the Soviet economy, the free market may
have arrived.

   Lawmakers Worry That Regulators, in Shadow
   Of Thrift Bailout, Are Being Too Tough on Banks

   WASHINGTON -- Only a few months back, Congress was
accusing the nation's financial regulators of being too soft
in their handling of Southwestern banks and thrifts.
   Now lawmakers are worried that the regulators are being
too hard in New England and other parts of the country.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The difference is the fear that a credit crunch is
beginning to choke off lending. And the result is that some
on Capitol Hill are accusing regulators of overreacting and
perhaps even pitching the economy into recession.
   "I think the experience of Texas looms too large,"
complains Rep. Barney Frank, a Democrat from hard-hit
Massachusetts. He says he has been deluged by complaints from
bankers and borrowers about regulatory excess. "The
regulators tell me they are erring on the side of safety,"
says Rep. Frank, who sits on the House Banking Committee. "I
don't think they should be erring at all."
   Says William Isaac, a former chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. who is now a bank consultant: "The
pendulum is swinging too far in the other direction. We
needed to tighten up, but I am concerned we're tightening up
too far, too fast."
   The prime target of these complaints is Comptroller of the
Currency Robert Clarke, whose examiners have stirred much of
the controversy by picking apart commercial real-estate
portfolios in New England's banks. Mr. Clarke, a soft-spoken
Houston banking lawyer, isn't backing down. He points to the
$243 billion thrift bailout as the justification for his
agency's aggressive examinations of banks.
   "The shareholders and the public who have paid and will
pay for {the thrift} mess have sent a pretty strong message
that they don't want to do it again," Mr. Clarke told a
bankers' convention last weekend.
   Mr. Clarke insists his agency hasn't tightened the rules.
Rather, he argues, when an economic slowdown hits, "the old
rules produce different results." With office vacancy rates
climbing in New England and the region's economy weakening,
Mr. Clarke says, it's only prudent for banks to "adjust the
fine-tuning knob" in evaluating loans, particularly those
made to real-estate developers. He argues that the strong
approach taken in New England is a model for financial
regulation in the 1990s.
   But prudence has a price. For example, since last fall,
when Mr. Clarke's examiners began scouring New England real
estate portfolios, three major New England banks have set
aside a total of more than $2 billion in reserves for
potential loan losses. That capital could have been used to
back as much as $30 billion in loans to the region's flagging
economy, says the chairman of one of the banks, Joel Alvord
of Shawmut National Corp. Now, small businesses of all kinds
are complaining that credit is harder to get. Examiners are
similarly peering over the shoulders of nervous bankers in
the Southeast and other parts of the country.
   Some critics argue that Mr. Clarke's office has backed
into making monetary policy by draining liquidity from the
banking system. Indeed, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan and others at the Fed are known to be concerned
that examiners might go too far or that bankers might
overreact by curtailing credit too severely. Mr. Greenspan is
understood to have personally conveyed this concern to Mr.
Clarke.
   Officials of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
say the big reserves taken by New England banks are a sign of
past banker mistakes, not of regulatory overkill. Karen
Wilson, newly appointed deputy comptroller for the Northeast,
says many banks have failed to update property appraisals
that may be from three years ago, before values began to
slide. In some cases, loans were made without any recorded
appraisals at all. Too many banks were counting on a rising
market to hide sloppy practices, she asserts.
   Tight competition bred loose standards. At one big New
England bank, the comptroller's office says, the average loan
officer oversaw 110 commercial loans involving 60 different
customers. "Nobody can keep up with 110 loans," says Stephen
Steinbrink, a top official in the comptroller's office who
has been coordinating the extra examiners shipped to the
Northeast.
   Many analysts, bankers and accountants concede that
lending mistakes were made, but still insist that regulators
have reacted too harshly. They point in particular to the
regulators' insistence that banks declare as nonperforming
certain loans that still are being serviced and set aside
funds to cover potential losses on those loans. The practice
has even created a new term, the "performing nonperforming
loan."
   Even if the lending rules haven't changed, banks are
operating in a highly charged atmosphere created by the
thrift mess. Last summer's thrift-bailout law vastly expanded
regulators' enforcement powers. Regulators flexing their new
muscles have given bankers the jitters.
   For instance, the FDIC recently slapped a tiny bank in
Edna, Kan., with a $9,600 fine -- more than a tenth of the
bank's annual income -- for filing a quarterly report two
weeks late. Only after Kansas Sen. Robert Dole raised the
matter on the Senate floor did the FDIC agree to reduce the
fine; the new amount hasn't been settled. But that isn't
likely to calm bankers worried about fines that can hit $1
million a day under the thrift law.
   Despite Sen. Dole's intervention, bankers are learning
that friends are harder to find on Capitol Hill these days.
The rules may not have changed for banks, but they certainly
have for Congress: Every member is aware that the Senate
Ethics Committee is investigating the "Keating Five" senators
who interceded with regulators on behalf of the now-defunct
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association.
   But it's easier for lawmakers now that the focus has
turned to the potential economic effects of regulators'
exams. Last month Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut
Democrat and a member of the Banking Committee, held a public
session back home at which he worried aloud that examiners
might be applying the lessons of Texas to New England without
taking into account differences between the two regions.
Unlike the oil-patch states, "We're not an economy based on a
single industry," he told Ms. Wilson of the comptroller's
office. He also raised the possibility that regulators could
create a "self-fulfilling prophecy" of tumbling real estate
values as banks scramble to foreclose and sell properties.
   Ms. Wilson denied that her agency's examiners are doing
anything more than making banks recognize the deterioration
that has already taken place in the market.
   Last week Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D., Mass.) held a similar
-- but closed-door -- meeting at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston. "There's tremendous concern about being tainted with
the Keating Five," says Mr. Kennedy. "But I'm not arguing on
behalf of a specific bank. I'm trying to find out what's
going on with our economy."

   Clean-Air Compromise Sought; Fears on Child Care Ease

   CLEAN-AIR COMPROMISES are sought in the House for smaller
companies.
   Under the clean-air bill that the Senate passed last week,
getting permits to operate would be a big hurdle for
companies that emit regulated substances. The House Energy
and Commerce Committee adopts an amendment backed by Rep.
Rick Boucher (D., Va.), requiring states to give small firms
extra time to comply with the rules. Rep. Ron Wyden (D.,
Ore.) will propose to temporarily delay steep fines if a
small company accidentally emits a prohibited substance as
it's trying to comply. His measure also is expected to seek
removal of criminal penalties for paper-work violations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Without such safeguards, permit requirements could become
the small-business controversy of 1990, predicts Theresa
Pugh, the National Association of Manufacturers' director of
environmental policy. The trade group contends that it
probably would cost small firms more to analyze their
chemical emissions when seeking a permit than to clean them
up. It urges that small enterprises be allowed to submit
estimates. Printers and others that produce batches of
different products would face repeated hassles if required to
get a permit for each product.
   The amendment for added time to meet permit rules remains
subject to review by the House panel; the Senate rejected a
similar provision.

   PRESSURES EASE for small business on child-care and
parental-leave bills.
   Small-business interests breathe easier after Congress
passes a child-care bill. Backers of the bill approved by the
House last week expect to reach a compromise with the Senate
version that will be acceptable to President Bush. Early
fears that a child-care law would sharply increase regulation
of small, private day-care providers or otherwise threaten
their businesses didn't materialize. Moreover, passage of the
bill may derail the push for legislation for mandatory
parental leave because Congress is unlikely to pass two
costly, family-oriented initiatives in one session.
   Small-business groups contend that a law requiring
employers to grant leaves and other benefits to new parents
would be a hardship for many small employers. Feelings run so
high that mandated parental leave is the closest thing to a
small-business "litmus-test" issue for legislators, says the
National Federation of Independent Business. The bill has
been stalemated on Capitol Hill, with both sides lacking the
votes to adopt or defeat it. Small-business lobbyists are
focusing on Democratic lawmakers, who tend to support the
leave.
   "Parental leave is a loser for the Democrats," argues Tom
Cator of National Small Business United. "It represents big
government."
   ---
   THE LION'S DEN? Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D., W.Va.), who
generally won praise from small-business lobbyists as
chairman of the Pepper Commission on health care, may face a
tough grilling from business owners next month. He will
address a joint Washington meeting of National Small Business
United and the National Association of Women Business Owners.
The Washington-based groups concede that, despite Mr.
Rockefeller's cooperation with small business on some health
issues, their members are likely to speak up against such
commission proposals as mandatory health insurance.
   ---
   A CIVIL RIGHTS BILL proposed in Congress to strengthen the
anti-bias rights of workers would probably increase the
number of lawsuits brought by disgruntled employees, small
businesses fear. "The bill could place a wedge between the
business community and the people they're trying to protect,"
says David Pinkus, whose Dallas landscaping company, North
Haven Gardens, employs 200 people. Businesses also fear the
bill's affirmative-action language would, in effect, force
them to have work forces numerically balanced by race and sex
unless they have business-related reasons for any imbalances.
The bill's backers say the measure wouldn't create quotas or
unfounded lawsuits.
   ---
   HIGHER FEES, lower funding for some SBA programs are hot
budget issues.
   The Bush administration proposes to boost fees on Small
Business Administration guaranteed loans to 5% of the loan
amount from 2%. It also wants to raise to 5% from 1.2% the
fee on small-business investment company loans. And the loan
fees for minority-owned investment firms would jump to 3%
from 1.2%. Some in Congress call the fee increases and other
changes in the fiscal 1991 budget "warmed-over Reaganisms"
because they're similar to those sought by Reaganites who
unsuccessfully tried to kill the SBA in the 1980s.
   Under other Bush budget proposals, only business owners
unable to get loans elsewhere would be eligible for SBA
disaster loans. The administration also wants to cut funding
for the college-based Small Business Development Centers to
$30 million from $50 million and to eliminate the program
after fiscal 1992. But Congress has historically protected
the disaster-aid fund and the popular SBDC program, which
gives free management advice to small firms.
   As for proposed fee increases, Senate Small Business
Committee Chairman Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.) says flatly: "We
ain't gonna do it."
   ---
   SMALL TALK: The SBA plans by 1993 to increase to 500,000
from 172,000 the number of companies it lists on a
computerized program to help small firms win federal
procurement contracts. . . . Commerce Secretary Mosbacher,
asked to meet with some East German entrepreneurs during a
recent trip there, answered, "Sure, that's no longer an
oxymoron." . . . Humorist Bob Orben says, "I knew small
business had come to Russia when the Baskin-Robbins flavor of
the month was borsch."

   DECLINE OF BRITISH TV

   Government deregulation is bringing a plethora of
conventional and satellite television channels to British
homes, but studies show audiences are down 10% from five
years ago.
   Some of the audience decline "is attributable to video,"
said the director of London Weekend Television, one of the
government's 15 regional franchises. But, he added, "the same
period saw a considerable increase in alternative leisure
activities," such as dining out.
   Britons still watch an average of 25 hours and 21 minutes
of TV every week, but 44% of those tuned in say they find
nothing appealing.
   The situation is troubling to an industry facing both
proposed legislation that would create a fifth land-based
channel and the start this month of a satellite network that
will add five channels. Another London Weekend official says
"the existing cake will have to be carved up in a larger
number of portions."
                                                                                                       

   TOKYO PROJECT FOR CESAR PELLI
                                                                                                       

   Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. said it has given a one
billion yen ($6.3 million) order to a U.S.-Japanese
consortium to design its new head office in Tokyo. The
company gave the order to Cesar Pelli &amp; Yamashita Associated
Architects, a joint venture between the U.S.'s Cesar Pelli &amp;
Associates and Japan's Yamashita Architects &amp; Engineers Inc.
The project has been closely watched as a test case of
Japan's commitment to allow greater access by foreign
companies to its construction market.
                                                                                                       

   FRENCH FASHION LOOKS EAST

   A group of France's most prominent fashion houses,
including those of Yves Saint Laurent and Emanuel Ungaro,
will stage a fashion show in Budapest next March. Jacques
Mouclier, president of the Chambre Syndicale, Paris's
official fashion organization, said sales to East Europe now
accounted for a negligible share of French fashion's $625
million export market. "The last 10 years were the Asian
decade," he said. "The next decade we're going to devote all
our energies to penetrating the East."
                                                                                                       

   U.S. WOOD FOR JAPAN
                                                                                                       

   Progress in the current round of U.S.-Japan wood-product
trade negotiations has been disappointing, U.S. wood-product
industry officials said yesterday in Tokyo. The officials
said antiquated building codes and product standards are a
non-tariff barrier keeping non-Japanese wood products out of
Japan. Among those obstacles is a limit on the height of
wooden buildings. The U.S. officials said current U.S.
wood-product exports to Japan amount to $2.8 billion,
consisting almost entirely of unprocessed raw wood.
                                                                                                       

   AIDS IN KUWAIT
                                                                                                       

   Fifteen new cases of AIDS were detected in Kuwait in the
last two months, all of them involving foreigners, the
newspaper Al-Rai al-Aam reported. The paper quoted a Health
Ministry spokesman as saying, "The new AIDS carriers were
deported on the spot." Kuwait has had a total of 70 cases of
AIDS, the spokesman reportedly said, adding that in the
latest cases symptoms of AIDS were found during tests on
incoming foreign laborers.
                                                                                                       

   PRESERVING CANADIAN SPRUCES
                                                                                                       

   The government of Canada's province of British Columbia
said it will introduce legislation to ban logging in much of
a remote valley containing the world's tallest spruce trees.
But the government said MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., one of North
America's largest forest-products companies, will be allowed
to harvest trees in just under half the 16,555-acre Carmanah
Valley on Vancouver Island. Environmental groups, who had
demanded that the government ban loggers from the entire
forest, called the partial ban a sellout.

   A total of 599 joint ventures have been signed between
East German and foreign companies, and another 400 will be
completed by the end of this month, according to a report by
the East German news agency ADN.
   The agency said 96% of the joint ventures had been signed
with West German companies; the remaining 4% were signed with
partners from Switzerland, Austria, the Soviet Union, the
U.S., Denmark, Japan, Yugoslavia, Holland, Sweden, Spain,
Turkey and Hungary.
   Most of the deals were signed by small and medium-sized
East German companies, the agency said. It said more than 90%
of the joint ventures have taken the legal form of a limited
liability company, or G.m.b.H.
   About 60% of the joint ventures are in the service and
tourism industry, while 30% are in the industrial sector.
East Berlin is by far the most popular choice for the joint
ventures, with 218.

   Barbara Piasecka Johnson, the Polish-born heiress to the
Johnson &amp; Johnson health-products fortune, opened an exhibit
of religious art from her personal collection at Warsaw's
Royal Palace. The exhibit includes works by Titian,
Caravaggio and Raphael, and proceeds from catalog sales will
be donated to Polish cultural-conservation efforts. . . .
China will send 3,000 students abroad this year, most of them
older students on short-term programs, an official report
said. In the past 12 years, China has sent between 60,000 and
80,000 students to foreign countries, and nearly half didn't
return.

   Canada Considers
   Appeal of Ruling
   On Antitrust Arm

   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government is considering an appeal
against a Quebec Superior Court decision, which ruled that
the operations of the Canadian Competition Tribunal were
unconstitutional.
   The Quebec court said the tribunal has been given the
powers of a court but doesn't have the "essential attributes"
of judicial independence.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The four-year-old tribunal is made up of appointed
judicial and business experts. It reviews cases referred to
it by the government's antitrust agency, the Bureau of
Competition Policy.
   Howard Wetston, the bureau's director of investigation and
research, said the ruling was "an important decision that
raises a number of questions related to the enforcement of
the competition act." Mr. Wetston said he is carefully
studying the decision with the Canadian Attorney General and
is "considering the question of an appeal."
   The Quebec court's ruling concerned a case involving Alex
Couture Inc., a Quebec City-based processor of animal waste
products. The tribunal approved a government order in 1987
blocking the merger between Alex Couture and a Montreal
animal rendering company. Alex Couture won a stay of
proceedings and then launched the court challenge against the
tribunal.
   The Quebec court said that because the tribunal lacks the
judicial independence of a court it violated Alex Couture's
"right of association" and its right to be heard by an
independent and impartial tribunal.
   The ruling prompted speculation about the possible impact
of the court's decision on major cases including its recent
approval of a consent order covering the merger of Imperial
Oil Ltd. and Texaco Canada Inc.
   An Imperial Oil spokesman said the ruling doesn't have any
implications for its merger with Texaco Canada because the
consent order was reached between the company and the
competition bureau. The $4.15 billion Imperial-Texaco Canada
merger, was the biggest case to come before the tribunal
since the agency was established in 1986.
   Imperial Oil, which is 70%-owned by Exxon Corp., purchased
78% of Texaco Canada last year from Texaco Inc. The Canadian
Bureau of Competition Policy reached an agreement for a
consent order with Imperial requiring Imperial to sell
various assets including 600 gas retail outlets, a refinery
and storage and distribution terminals.
   The tribunal approved the consent order after some
adjustments were made. Imperial is proceeding with the
divestitures.

   In your March 9 page-one article "Raider Referendum," you
characterize USX Corp. stockholders who support Carl Ichan's
efforts to split USX into separate companies as "quick-buck"
investors. A review of the facts demonstrates that USX stock
sells for about the same price today that it did nine years
ago. To add insult to injury, earnings are 73% lower, book
value is 72% lower, the dividend is 30% lower and long-term
debt is twice as high. Just how long should stockholders wait
before expecting reasonable returns on their investments?

   Change of President at Fuji Industries
   Ends Struggle for Control of Ailing Firm

   TOKYO -- Fuji Heavy Industries Inc.'s decision to name a
former Nissan Motor executive as president ends a
behind-the-scenes struggle for control of ailing Fuji between
Nissan and Industrial Bank of Japan.
   Fuji's current president, Toshijiro Tajima, announced that
he would hand over the reins to Isamu Kawai, a 68-year-old
former senior executive of Nissan and the president of Nissan
Diesel Motor Co., a Nissan affiliate. The appointment is
expected to be approved by shareholders at the annual meeting
in June. Mr. Tajima will remain chairman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nissan, Japan's second-largest car maker, Industrial Bank,
Fuji's main banker, and Fuji, best known for its Subaru
autos, are part of the IBJ-led industrial group. Power
struggles between companies in the same industrial group for
control of another member of the group are unusual in
harmony-driven Japan. But the instincts of both Nissan and
IBJ to support a fellow group member in trouble aren't
unusual. Being able to count on group members for financial
or technical assistance in times of need is among the rewards
of group intrarelationships.
   But Fuji officials conceded that the company's fate will
be tied to Nissan. "The world is changing. Technology is
moving forward. We have to move closer to Nissan," said
Tetsuo Miyaji, executive vice president at Fuji. "We decided
it would be better to deepen the relationship."
   Industry analysts predicted that once Mr. Kawai is
installed, Nissan will move quickly to forge closer
cooperation between the two companies -- in everything from
the initial design to production to sales and marketing.
"This is a sign that Nissan is going to take an active hand
in Fuji Heavy," said Neil Doying, an auto analyst at Baring
Securities (Japan) Ltd.
   That's likely to mean a diminished role for IBJ, a bank
that has historically played a leading role in promoting the
development of key Japanese industries and coming up with
restructuring plans when companies in old-line industries,
such as shipping and steel, ran into trouble. Given its
longstanding ties to Fuji, observers had expected IBJ to do
the same with the car maker.
   Currently, Nissan is Fuji's largest shareholder, with a
5.9% stake; IBJ is next, with 4.9%. While no one expects
Nissan to launch a full-scale takeover right away, analysts
didn't rule out the possibility of a merger sometime. They
said some consolidation in the Japanese auto industry may be
inevitable in the 1990s, as some of Japan's small car makers
realize they don't have deep enough pockets or the expertise
to think and act globally.
   Fuji recently revised its estimated operating loss for the
year ended March 31 to 23 billion yen (about $145.6 million),
worse than previously figured. Net income is also likely to
be worse than estimated, down 16% to six billion yen. Final
fiscal-year figures won't be released until May. "They just
aren't selling enough cars to cover their costs," said Peter
Boardman, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities (Japan).
   In Japan, Fuji is a weak player in the intensely
competitive domestic market. The elimination of steep taxes
on new cars last April has hit subcompact auto makers hard,
especially Fuji. Demand for cars soared, but consumers
shunned small cars and snapped up large luxury models.
   Fuji's best hope is the Legacy, its newest
four-wheel-drive model, which has sold relatively well so far
in Japan. But such reliance on the Legacy leaves Fuji
extremely vulnerable, analysts said.
   Things don't look much brighter overseas. The Legacy
hasn't sold as well in the crucial U.S. market as Fuji had
hoped. Monthly unit sales dropped from around 13,000 in June
1989 to 6,570 in January 1990. Sales have climbed back
slightly so far this year, but not enough to get Fuji out of
the woods.
   Despite Fuji's troubles, analysts said there are benefits
for Nissan in the new arrangement. For example, without any
substantial capital investment, Nissan may be able to use
Fuji's plants. That would help ease Nissan's current
production-capacity constraints. And both companies have
growing aerospace divisions that could benefit from closer
cooperation and technology exchanges, analysts said.
   Even with Nissan's help and IBJ's continued financial
backing, no one expects Fuji's troubles to be reversed
overnight. Still, if anyone can make the new Fuji-Nissan
relationship work, it's probably Mr. Kawai. He spent 39 years
climbing the ladder at Nissan before becoming president of
Nissan Diesel in 1985. Industry experts give him high marks
for pulling Nissan Diesel out of a slump and expanding its
share of the Japanese truck market.

   Doctors at a for-profit health clinic chain sharply
increased the number of patient laboratory and X-ray
examinations when they were offered bonuses to increase their
clinics' revenues, according to a new study.
   The finding isn't surprising, but it adds a new dimension
to the controversy over the role of money in medicine. While
many businesses use bonuses to increase sales, some health
care experts worry that such incentives can cloud a doctor's
judgment in prescribing care for patients.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's one piece of information about financial incentives
and physician behavior," says David Hemenway of the Harvard
School of Public Health and lead author of the study. "It
says that money matters. It doesn't say money is the only
thing that matters or even the most important thing."
   The report is based on the experience of 15 doctors at
different clinics owned by Health Stop Medical Management
Inc., a chain of walk-in primary care centers based in Newton
Centre, Mass., that voluntarily participated in the study.
It's especially interesting because it compares the practice
patterns of the same doctors before and after Health Stop
instituted a bonus program in mid-1985. While dozens of
studies have examined the impact of incentives on doctors --
with mixed conclusions -- very few have compared the same
doctors, working at the same facilities.
   Prior to the bonus program, Health Stop doctors were paid
at a flat rate of $28 an hour. Under the bonus program, they
were paid from $28 to $32 an hour or a percentage of the
gross monthly charges they generated, whichever was higher.
Doctors were ranked monthly based on the average charge per
patient visit and the number of diagnostic tests performed.
The reports circulated among the doctors and managers
questioned those whose results were considered outside normal
ranges.
   Researchers found that doctors ordered 23% more lab tests
per patient visit and 16% more X-rays during a three-month
period after the incentive program was established, compared
with the like period a year earlier, when the flat-rate
salary was in effect. Patient visits increased 12%. The
average charge per visit, in constant 1984 dollars, rose 7%,
while total monthly charges soared 20%.
   Among the 15 doctors, six generated enough revenue to get
a bonus every month, earning an average of $5,045 a month,
while seven never received a bonus, earning an average of
$4,291. The doctors paid a bonus saw an average of 378
patients a month, while those who didn't saw an average of
276 patients. The variation in patient visits wasn't
explained.
   Doctors generated similar increases in charges per month,
regardless of their bonus status, indicating that an
incentive program can induce a group of doctors to prescribe
more services, even if only some of them benefit, the
researchers said.
   Despite the increased revenues, researchers said they
found "little evidence of gross overtreatment." The report is
from a larger study of Health Stop's operations conducted in
the mid-1980s.
   Mark Shankman, the concern's president and chief executive
officer, said the authors drew conclusions that "aren't fully
supported by their data," and suggested that one reason for
increased revenues is that patients are gaining confidence in
such clinics and coming in with more serious problems. He
also said the observed price increase was similar to national
increases. "While this type of study plays a role in health
care research," Dr. Shankman said, "we recommend caution in
interpreting this data, drawing conclusions about our medical
practices and making policy decisions."
   The study appears in today's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine, which published an article 18 months ago
on the personal experience of a doctor who was fired from a
walk-in clinic because he failed to generate enough revenue
per patient. Arnold Relman, the journal's editor, is a
leading critic of for-profit medicine and its potential for
prompting practitioners to run up medical bills needlessly or
to withhold necessary care.

   Health Concern
   To Post Charge
   Of $125 Million

   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. -- Johnson &amp; Johnson said it will post
a charge of $125 million, reducing first-quarter per-share
earnings 38 cents.
   In the 1989 first quarter, net was $317 million, or 95
cents a share, on sales of $2.45 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The health-care products concern, which cited adverse
factors in certain Latin American nations for the charge,
didn't offer comment in a prepared statement on how overall
first-quarter results will compare with year-ago figures. A
company spokesman said he wouldn't speculate about such a
comparison.
   The spokesman said Canada and all of Latin America
accounted for $1.2 billion of 1989 sales. The company doesn't
provide a more detailed breakdown. In recent years, the
impact of foreign currency translations has been positive and
negative. Excluding the effects of foreign currency
translations, 1989 sales would have increased 11% rather than
the actual 8.4%, the spokesman said. In 1988, favorable
foreign currency translations boosted sales gains by an
additional 1.7%.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Johnson &amp; Johnson closed at $58.25, up 12.5 cents.
   The company said the charges reflect "severe economic
turmoil, inflation, exorbitantly high and volatile interest
rates and deteriorating business conditions" in certain Latin
American countries. The bulk of the charges include
provisions for writing off and restructuring units in
Argentina and for paying additional interest on the company's
debt in that country. That debt has been liquidated, the
company said.
   The charge also recognizes "the impact of the recent
unprecedented monetary restrictions" imposed by Brazil,
Johnson &amp; Johnson said.

</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Stocks drifted slightly lower as widespread
selling of oil issues, stemming from the recent decline in
crude-oil prices, weighed on the market.
   While the price of oil abruptly reversed course during the
session on reports that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries might hold an emergency meeting to
address the slump in world oil markets, the rebound failed to
stem the weakness in energy stocks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With blue-chip oil issues under pressure, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average closed with a decline of 1.35 at 2729.73
after spending the session in a narrow range.
   Energy-related stocks captured 10 of the top 18 places on
the New York Stock Exchange's list of most active issues, but
trading overall remained lackluster. Big Board volume
amounted to 141,080,000 shares, a modest improvement over
Tuesday's total of 136,020,000 shares.
   The pace of activity slowed substantially during the
afternoon as the market started to wind down in advance of
the observance of Good Friday, for which U.S. stock exchanges
will be closed.
   Among broader market measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock
Index slid 0.15 to 341.92 and the NYSE Composite Index
dropped 0.06 to 187.57, while the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index gained .04 to 318.32. Decliners edged advancers on the
Big Board by 762 to 720.
   John D. Connolly, chairman of the investment policy
committee at Dean Witter Reynolds, described the session as
"a pretty listless day, with the exception of the oils having
their problems."
   Oil stocks contributing to the decline in the industrial
average included Exxon, which fell 3/8 to 45 5/8; Chevron,
which tumbled 1 3/4 to 65 7/8; Texaco, which dropped 1 to 57
3/8; and USX, which dropped 5/8 to 34. All but Chevron also
ranked among the most active on the Big Board; USX set the
pace for the group, as 1.7 million shares changed hands in
composite trading.
   Other oil issues taking high places on the Big Board's
most actives list included Amoco, which went down 7/8 to 50
1/2; Mobil, down 1 to 59 5/8; Phillips Petroleum, down 1/2 to
25 3/8; Occidental Petroleum, down 1/4 to 26 7/8; and Unocal,
down 1/2 to 29 3/4.
   Crude-oil futures plummeted in early New York trading,
sparking the sell-off in the oil sector. May futures on West
Texas Intermediate crude skidded to a low of $16.25 a barrel
before recovering to settle at $18.06 a barrel, up 38 cents
on the day.
   But several oil analysts warned that oil prices are likely
to decline further over the short run, leading to further
pressure on oil companies' shares. Against the backdrop of
those forecasts, "the recovery in the crude market had very
little to do with oil stocks," Mr. Connolly said.
   Two oil-field services stocks, Schlumberger and Baker
Hughes, rounded out the list of the 10 most heavily traded
energy issues. Schlumberger fell 1 to 50 as 1.4 million
shares were traded, while Baker Hughes declined 1 3/8 to 25
7/8 on 1.2 million shares.
   Rowan, whose first-quarter results fell short of most
analysts' expectations, dropped 1/2 to 12. The company
reported a loss of nine cents a share for the period.
Elsewhere in the oil-services group, Halliburton dropped 5/8
to 43 1/2 and Helmerich &amp; Payne fell 1 to 32 1/2.
   But there were some exceptions to the rule in energy
issues, including Ashland Oil, which climbed 7/8 to 36 5/8,
and Sun, which rose 3/8 to 37 1/4. Kidder Peabody reaffirmed
its buy recommendations on the two refiners, based on "very
fat and healthy" margins between the prices of crude oil and
petroleum products despite the price declines in both.
   Three airline stocks posted gains after Prudential-Bache
Securities initiated coverage of the companies with buy
recommendations: AMR, the owner of American Airlines, which
went up 7/8 to 66 1/4; Delta Air Lines, up 1 1/8 to 73 5/8,
and Midway Airlines, up 1/2 to 13.
   Although airlines stand to benefit from lower oil prices
through reduced costs for jet fuel, other issues in the
sector finished mixed. UAL, the parent company of United
Airlines, fell 1 to 160 1/4; Southwest Airlines rose 3/4 to
25; Pan Am dropped 1/8 to 2 7/8; and Alaska Air Group added
3/8 to 23 1/2.
   Federal National Mortgage Association, which reported that
first-quarter earnings surged about 68%, rallied 7/8 to 35 on
1.2 million shares. The results were better than analysts had
generally expected.
   United Telecommunications retreated 1 7/8 to 40 1/4 on two
million shares after rising a total of 2 3/8 Monday and
Tuesday on the news of MCI Communications' agreement to
acquire Telecom USA, a rival in the long-distance phone
market.
   United Telecommunications told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report that it expects to report its first-quarter
earnings on Tuesday. PaineWebber analyst Jack Grubman noted
that the company has indicated it expects to post net income
for the quarter of about 50 cents to 55 cents a share, down
from an earlier projection of 55 cents to 60 cents.
   Woolworth went up 3/4 to 62 1/4. The company's board
declared a 2-to-1 stock split and increased the quarterly
dividend by 11%.
   TCBY Enterprises gained 1 1/8 to 22 1/8. Shearson Lehman
Hutton reiterated a favorable rating on the stock, based on
early indications that McDonald's introduction of frozen
yogurt in certain areas of the U.S. doesn't appear to be
posing a serious threat to the company.
   Norton jumped 3 1/8 to 76. A federal judge ordered the
company, which is fighting a $75-a-share tender offer from
Britain's BTR PLC, to hold its annual meeting April 27 as it
had originally scheduled. After BTR made its offer, Norton
canceled the meeting, saying it needed more time to weigh
alternatives.
   Apple Bancorp advanced 1 7/8 to 43 3/4. Its directors
rejected a $38-a-share takeover offer from New York real
estate investor Stanley Stahl, its largest shareholder, and
directed its management to seek other possible bids.
   West Point-Pepperell surged 5 to 42 5/8. The Wall Street
Journal reported that investor William Farley plans to
surrender his majority ownership of the company in connection
with a debt restructuring.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index, weighted
heavily with oil stocks, fell 1.98 to 357.54. Volume totaled
13,520,000 shares, compared with 11,770,315 shares Tuesday.
There were 233 issues advancing, 282 declining and 292 were
unchanged.
   Among energy-related Amex issues, Imperial Oil Class A
retreated 1 5/8 to 50 1/2, Mitchell Energy &amp; Development
dropped 1 to 19 1/8, Global Natural Resources fell 1/2 to 7
3/4 and Energy Service dropped 1/4 to 4 3/4.
   Jan Bell Marketing tumbled 1 1/2 to 8 3/8 on 1.8 million
shares. Goldman Sachs cut its 1990 earnings estimate by 20
cents a share to 75 cents a share, citing its belief that the
company's first-quarter sales were about even with the
year-earlier level. The company declined to comment.
   ENSR jumped 2 1/8 to 8 after agreeing to be acquired for
$8.25 a share by NuKEM G.m.b.H., a West German company. The
accord permits ENSR to hold talks with any other potential
bidders that may emerge.

   Live Entertainment Names Patterson,
   Ex-Head of Retailer, to Two Top Posts

   VAN NUYS, Calif. -- Live Entertainment Inc. named Wayne H.
Patterson as chairman and chief executive officer, filling
the posts formerly held by Jose Menendez, slain last August
along with his wife, Kitty.
   Mr. Patterson, 43 years old, served more than three years
at the helm of Pace Membership Warehouse Inc., and during his
tenure sales and profits of the discount retailer more than
doubled. Last November, Pace was sold for $323 million to K
mart Corp., and since then, Mr. Patterson has served as K
mart's executive vice president, specialty retailing. Prior
to his work at Pace, Mr. Patterson spent more than 15 years
with the accounting firm of Touche, Ross &amp; Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Patterson's appointment brings a captain to a company
that has drifted without a permanent chairman and chief
executive since Mr. Menendez's death. "My sense is that a
large part of my job will be leadership, being visible both
internally and externally, and letting people know there's a
full-time chairman," said Mr. Patterson, who was visiting
Live's Lieberman Enterprises Inc. unit in Minneapolis
yesterday.
   Live distributes videocassettes and sells entertainment
software.
   Since the homicides, Mr. Menendez's former posts have been
held on an interim basis by Peter M. Hoffman, president and
chief executive of Carolco Pictures Inc., the entertainment
concern that holds a 49% stake in Live.
   The appointment of Mr. Patterson also comes at a time when
the cloud of controversy surrounding Live following the
homicides appears to have lifted.
   Last month, police arrested the Menendez couple's two
sons, Lyle, 22, and Erik, 19, and charged them with murdering
their parents to gain access to the couple's $14 million
estate. Both sons have pleaded innocent. The arrests quieted
speculation that the brutal shotgun slayings might be linked
to organized crime. Live had purchased two companies from
individuals who have been identified by law-enforcement
authorities as involved in organized crime.
   In the week following the arrests, Live released the
findings of an internal investigation, which found "no
credible information" that would link the company's
operations to the slayings. The report by the law firm Kaye,
Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler also found "no evidence of
criminal activity" at Live.
   Mr. Patterson said he read the 220-page report and made
inquiries to people familiar with Live as part of his "due
diligence" review, and added, "I am convinced that the
company has quality directors and quality people." As for the
speculation of organized crime connections, he said "there
was no basis for concern."
   Since the arrest of the Menendez sons, Live's stock price
has rebounded. In the months following the killings, the
price sank to $13.25, but it has since risen to around $20 a
share. Yesterday, Live shares rose 50 cents to close at
$21.25 in national over-the-counter trading.
   Mr. Patterson declined to lay out his specific plans for
Live, saying he first wants "to really go through the
business and understand it in a definitive way." But he did
say of the company's existing operations that "it's likely
we're going to stay in those businesses and let them grow."
   He added that Live has "progressed admirably in Jose's
absence," something he attributes to the "can-do attitude" of
employees.

   Employers Add RICO Suits to Arsenal
   For Labor Battles, and Unions Fire Back

   Companies and unions embroiled in labor disputes have
begun attacking each other with a high-caliber weapon: RICO.
   Unfortunately for both sides, it often backfires.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Designed as a tool to help authorities root out organized
crime in business and labor, the federal Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act allows for civil suits that
permit injured parties to collect triple damages if they can
prove a pattern of racketeering. Though such suits keep
coming, thus far no union or company has carried a huge award
home from a RICO battle. What the two sides have done in such
cases, however, is entangle themselves in expensive court
battles and poison relations even further.
   Earlier this week, strikebound Greyhound Lines Inc. became
the latest company to take a chance on RICO. Desperate to end
the strike violence that has engulfed its struggling
business, the bus line filed a $30 million civil RICO suit
accusing the striking Amalgamated Transit Union of using
"coordinated criminal and extortionate means" to cripple the
company financially.
   The unit of GLI Holding Co. thus joined a small but
growing number of employers that have wheeled out the big
RICO gun. They range from the now-defunct Yellow Bus Co.,
which pressed a $3 million RICO suit against 12 members of a
Washington Teamsters local, to troubled Eastern Airlines,
which in 1988 filed a massive $1.5 billion RICO suit accusing
its machinists' and pilots' unions of attempting to destroy
the company through racketeering, extortion, fraud and
defamation.
   Some legal experts contend that the use of RICO by either
side in a strike situation is a perversion of the law's
intent. "Whatever RICO was designed for, it wasn't designed
to intervene in routine labor disputes," says G. Robert
Blakey, a Notre Dame law professor who helped draft the
original RICO legislation.
   Moreover, says Mr. Blakey, the use of RICO often
complicates rather than solves the plaintiff's labor
problems. "I think there is this popular image that RICO can
do all kinds of things for you, that calling somebody a
racketeer induces a settlement," he says. "That's not true.
More often than not, if you call a person a racketeer, he
digs his heels in."
   Employers have usually been the first to employ RICO in
labor disputes, but unions have often counterattacked with
their own racketeering suits. The United Mine Workers union
has done so twice in recent years. In the long-running
Eastern Airlines dispute, the unions' countersuit accused the
airline of engaging in "fraudulent empire building."
   "What else can you do?" says Earl V. Brown Jr., UMW
associate general counsel. "Do you just sit there and let the
pot call the kettle black or do you go and fight back?"
   Management lawyers contend that RICO is a valid tool when
union members resort to violence in a strike; they say it is
a means to collect damages and deter further unrest.
"Criminal prosecutions don't compensate victims for economic
losses," says a lawyer who represents several coal companies.
"When unions want to engage in criminal activity involving
shootings and beatings, they have to be prepared to face
RICO. There's not a lot of difference between organized crime
and a union when they resort to those tactics."
   Greyhound's RICO suit will be heard in a federal court in
Jacksonville, Fla., site of a March 11 sniping incident in
which seven Greyhound passengers were injured by shrapnel and
debris after a bullet was fired through a bus roof. The
company took the action after five weeks of widespread
violence that included more than 30 shootings of company
buses and terminals and 80 bomb threats. Individual state and
local court orders obtained by the company in 20 cities
failed to stem the attacks and Greyhound officials said that,
through RICO, they hoped to obtain a federal court order
banning strike violence nationwide.
   "We've pretty much exhausted all the other rights and
remedies we have as a private company," says P. Anthony
Lannie, Greyhound's executive vice president and chief labor
negotiator. "If they won't stop it because a court orders
them to stop it, then perhaps they will stop it if the court
is imposing liability on them for doing so."
   Although the resolution of the Greyhound case may take
years, the ATU -- like other unions hit with RICO suits --
immediately felt the pressure. Even though the company and
the union were embroiled in a strike, the federal judge
hearing the case allowed the company to immediately begin
taking depositions from ATU officials and examining union
files. "This creates a tremendous distortion of labor law as
it previously existed," says ATU general counsel Earl Putnam.
"It creates a tremendous imbalance against the unions."
   Critics contend that disruption of union strike strategy
-- and ultimately destruction of the bargaining unit -- is
the real intent of RICO suits filed by employers. "What
they're trying to do with RICO is go after the unions
themselves," says Jordan Rossen, general counsel for the
United Auto Workers.
   Lengthy litigation would seem to favor companies, with
their deeper pockets. But that isn't always the case. While
trying to prove that they have been harmed financially, for
instance, some companies have been ordered to open their
books to union lawyers. And, in the case of one San Francisco
electrical concern whose RICO suit was dismissed as
frivolous, the court ordered the company to pay the
defendants' legal bills.
   Even in the cases that are settled, the long-term impact
on labor relations can be devastating, especially where the
employer has accused individual union leaders of being
racketeers. "How can you call someone a racketeer one day and
have a harmonious, problem-solving relationship with him the
next?" asks Mr. Brown of the UMW. "The only person who would
have a thick skin to that kind of accusation would be a real
racketeer."

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- East Germany needs annual
growth rates of 8.5% if the production gap between the two
German states is to be closed by the year 2000, the East
Berlin Institute for International Politics and Economics
said.
   The economic research institute said in a report that the
8.5% growth in the gross national product also would be
necessary to keep unemployment rates in East Germany from
rising too sharply.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the East German economy grows at a rate of only 5%, the
institute said, then this will mean a loss of about 1.5
million jobs by 1995 and a loss of 2.6 million jobs by 2000,
the institute said. The growth rates will depend to a large
degree on the strength of capital investments.

   I was born and raised in Waldenburg, a city about 30 miles
south of Lignitz, the town featured in your March 9 page-one
article. When the war was over, the Russians and Poles came,
killing many of the Germans living there and deporting the
rest of us in cattle cars. During the fall of 1989, I had the
opportunity to go back to my hometown. The decay you so
eloquently describe was everywhere. My parents' house was
only a shadow of its appearance in 1945. A friendly, elderly
Pole showed me around, and he seemed to remember what the
area had looked like when the new masters took over. Clearly,
Germany's loss has not been Poland's gain.
   I now live in this country, and I do not wish to tell the
Germans or the Poles how to settle their differences.
However, not all the injustices in the world were perpetrated
by the Germans, and settling scores by taking land from the
vanquished and expelling the inhabitants of those lands does
not appear to be a solid foundation for peace. I hope a
lasting settlement of these thorny disputes can be reached
within a peaceful Europe.

   As Economy Crawls Along, Old-Fashioned
   Stock Picking Picks Up

   NEW YORK -- In a bull market, it's easy for investors to
grab a bunch of stocks in a strong industry and watch the
returns soar. But in an uncertain market like today's, that
strategy may not work.
   With the economy crawling along in 1990, some money
managers are opting for eclectic portfolios of carefully
selected stocks. With old-fashioned stock picking, the money
managers hope to outperform their sector-betting peers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're in a slower economy; a rolling recession not only
affects industries, but individual companies within
industries," says Ellen Harris, chief domestic investment
officer at Mitchell Hutchins Asset Management Inc., the
adviser to PaineWebber Inc. mutual funds. "You need strong
economic signals to create sector trends -- down or up."
   No doubt, industry groups fall and rise even when markets
and the economy are moving sideways. Air freight and
semiconductor stocks, for example were two top performers in
the first quarter, with gains of 19.6% and 14.33%,
respectively. (Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index fell 3% in
the quarter.) But lately, there is divergence among companies
within many industry groups, and that's why some stock
pickers are excelling this year.
   Currently, "investors are focusing a lot more on
company-specific issues, rather than the group," says John
Lazlo, an analyst who covers semiconductor stocks for
PaineWebber. "There used to be group moves, but now stocks
move company by company."
   For example, Mr. Lazlo notes that Intel jumped 21% in the
first quarter, while National Semiconductor gained a more
modest 7%. Why the difference? Intel dominates the market in
certain chip products, Mr. Lazlo says. National Semiconductor
competes in chip products that are also produced by other
suppliers.
   Also, the technical shape of the stock market this year
seems to favor stock pickers. Though the market has been
rising in recent weeks, the gains are concentrated in fewer
stocks lately. The advance-decline, which adds up the
difference between declining and advancing issues on the New
York Stock Exchange, "has been falling since August, showing
internal market weakness," says Robert Dickey, technical
analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc.
   Skillful sector players did well last year by picking a
few well-performing industry groups, like oil or beverage
stocks. Sector players are "top-down" investors. They believe
they can spot macroeconomic trends in the world economy that
will benefit a specific industry.
   Sometimes, the top-down strategists try to predict shifts
in the supply and demand of certain commodities, like copper
or oil. Other times, they try to be the first to spot a major
trend in consumer habits, such as greater use of personal
computers. A top-down strategist's tool box is full of
forecasts and statistics on interest and exchange rates, the
money supply and economic growth around the world, to name a
few.
   For a "bottom-up" strategist, it's secondary if a company
is big or small, makes shoes or gasoline. These investors
thumb through stock guides and research reports in search of
companies that have strong franchises, unique products,
dominant market share and a host of other criteria that might
make the company special.
   Typically, most money managers use a blend of these two
strategies, but are biased toward one discipline or the
other.
   George Bennett, the portfolio manager of Massachusetts
Managed Sectors Trust, must be invested in five or fewer
sectors of the stock market at any one time, according to his
fund's charter. Yet Mr. Bennett says he is a stock picker at
heart and has brought a "bottom-up" discipline to a
"top-down" fund. This past year, this combined approach
earned the fund a roaring 42% gain. But the first quarter has
been tougher. To date, Mr. Bennett says he lags the market by
"two or three percent."
   "Sector investing becomes difficult when the market is
going through a transition period like it is now," Mr.
Bennett says. "You don't have a momentum in sectors; I can't
really move in this market."
   Mr. Bennett still argues that the current muddle in the
market and economy make top-down analysis all the more
important. "I have been hurt by macroeconomic factors," such
as the rise in interest rates and the scare over credit
quality in financial stocks, he says. Many companies in his
portfolio, he says, are fundamentally sound, even though
they've been trampled by the herd.
   Graham Tanaka, president of Tanaka Capital Management
Inc., keeps a macroeconomic outlook in mind, but it's not his
main focus when he is hunting for stocks. "Buying sectors is
almost as tough as predicting the direction of the market,"
he says. Mr. Tanaka is a bottom-up investor, and his main
investing criterion is earnings growth. His largest holding
is Airborne Freight Corp., up 35% this year. Other holdings
among his 18 stocks include Intel, Humana Inc., Federal
National Mortgage Association and American Cyanamid Co.
   "The common theme among these stocks is that we believe
earnings will be in three years 40% to 100% higher than they
are now," he says. Mr. Tanaka's accounts were up about 2% in
the first quarter, about five percentage points better than
the S&amp;P 500.
   Stock pickers don't always win big, of course. One of Mr.
Tanaka's holdings, National Data Corp., is down 27% this
year. The company yesterday reported third-quarter earnings
fell 4.4% from the year-earlier quarter. But Mr. Tanaka is
sticking with his bet. Current earnings problems are related
to the cost of the company's effort to build a new business,
he says. National Data closed down $1 at $24.50 in
over-the-counter trading yesterday. "We see it as a major
buying opportunity," Mr. Tanaka says.

   Weakening the Dollar
   Is an Irrational Policy

   I want to commend you for your March 9 editorial "Why the
Fire Sale?" You are quite right in pointing out the
counterproductive nature of U.S. government actions against
the dollar. This irrational policy helps foreigners at the
expense of Americans. In addition to being a bad bargain when
Americans sell assets to foreigners, a cheap dollar makes it
more expensive for U.S. businessmen to invest abroad in such
promising markets as the emerging democracies in Eastern
Europe.
   The main argument in favor of a lower dollar, that it
supposedly helps reduce the foreign trade deficit, does not
stand up under critical examination. A lower dollar means
higher inflation rates, which increase interest costs, which
undermine the competitiveness of the U.S. in the
international marketplace. In contrast, a strong dollar
reduces inflationary pressures and results in lower interest
rates, which have a favorable impact on the operating costs
of the capital-intensive enterprises that account for most
U.S. exports.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Historical evidence supports the view that a strong dollar
is good for the U.S. trade balance. In the period 1945-1972,
the dollar was the strongest currency in the world, and the
U.S. had the lowest interest rates of any major industrial
country and a highly favorable trade balance.

   Security Pacific
   Profit Rose 5%
   In First Quarter

   LOS ANGELES -- Security Pacific Corp. said its
first-quarter net income rose 5% to $188.4 million, or $1.54
a share.
   The results were marred by a jump in bad loans and in
foreclosed real estate and were below Wall Street estimates.
They touched off an early mild decline in Security Pacific's
stock, which already had been trading at depressed levels
relative to its earnings, and highlighted the challenge faced
by the company's new chief executive officer, Robert Smith,
as he attempts to boost earnings and market value, both of
which are believed to be crucial to his long-term strategy
for the bank.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Security
Pacific closed at $35.875, unchanged. The quarterly results
indicate a price-to-earnings multiple of about 6; J.P. Morgan
&amp; Co.'s multiple, by comparison, is about 8.
   In the year-earlier period, Security Pacific earned $179.3
million, also $1.54 a share. The company had 116.5 million
shares outstanding in the latest quarter, up from 112.7
million a year earlier.
   Most analysts had projected per-share earnings for the
period of between $1.60 and $1.65. But Security Pacific's
nonperforming loans edged up to $1.7 billion from $1.6
billion a year earlier, mainly because of troubled loans in
Australia and the United Kingdom. Its level of repossessed
real estate jumped 72%, to $542 million from $315 million a
year ago. Net credit losses, excluding developing-country
debt, totaled $113.9 million, 22% above a year-earlier $93.6
million. The company's reserve for credit losses stood at
$1.2 billion at March 31, roughly the same as last year's
reserve.
   The company also said its net interest margin -- the
difference between what it pays for funds and receives on its
loans -- slipped to 3.95% from a year-earlier 4.21%.
   John Kooken, vice chairman and chief financial officer,
said that $40 million of the credit losses came from the
devastated Arizona real estate market. Security Pacific had a
loss of $176 million in its Arizona operations last year, but
despite the continuing bleeding in the first quarter, Mr.
Kooken said the bank still expects its Arizona losses for all
of 1990 to be "substantially below" 1989's levels.
   He also said that the swollen repossessed property
portfolio reflected problems in California and overseas, as
well as in Arizona. But he said the bank foresees no imminent
swoon in California real estate; such a development is much
feared in the banking industry because many lenders have
heavy exposure there and because California's lengthy real
estate boom has left it one of the few healthy markets in the
country.

   Fed Governor Seger's Lobbying Efforts
   On Behalf of Banks Angers House Panel

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)
CONGRESS (CNG)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Lobbying by Federal Reserve Board Governor
Martha Seger has triggered a complaint from the House Banking
Committee and raised embarrassing questions about disarray
within the Fed.
   The controversy involves proposed money-laundering
legislation that would have imposed new record-keeping rules
on banks. Officials of the Fed, the Treasury and the House
Banking Committee were attempting behind the scenes to work
out compromise language. But Ms. Seger, according to
congressional aides, worked independently to promote the
banking industry's point of view and ultimately played a role
in disrupting the settlement process.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Members of the House Banking Committee have raised
questions about whether Ms. Seger's advocacy in the banks'
behalf was inappropriate, and have asked Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan to look into the matter. Ms. Seger didn't answer
phone calls.
   On March 30, Rep. Esteban Torres (D., Calif.) wrote to
Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez complaining that a
Fed governor whom he didn't identify had "initiated contacts
with bank trade associations." The letter questioned the
authority of a Fed official "to advocate action by a trade
association in legislative matters pending before Congress."
   Mr. Gonzalez, in forwarding the complaint to Mr. Greenspan
on Friday, asked the Fed chairman if the Fed has a policy
governing "the lobbying efforts of any individual Board
member." Mr. Greenspan hasn't responded, but Ms. Seger's
actions were the subject of internal discussions at the Fed
even before Mr. Gonzalez's letter arrived.
   Most government agencies lobby the Congress to some
degree. In the case of the Fed, governors usually coordinate
their contacts with Congress through the Fed's
congressional-liaison office, according to Oliver Ireland,
associate general counsel.
   The congressional complaints bring to the surface concerns
that have long circulated within the Fed about Ms. Seger, and
may further isolate her within the organization. In addition
to dissenting frequently in favor of lower interest rates,
she is often at odds with the Fed staff, travels frequently
and sometimes can't be reached. A former state banking
regulator from Michigan, Ms. Seger was named to a 14-year
term on the Fed by President Reagan in 1984.
   At issue was a proposal by Rep. Torres to force the
Treasury to write stringent new regulations requiring banks
to obtain detailed information when they transfer money by
wire. The Fed governors, including Ms. Seger, opposed the
Torres proposal.
   While the other Fed governors relied on Fed staffers to
try settling the issue, Ms. Seger had conversations with
banking trade groups and, according to Banking Committee
staffers, a heated telephone conversation with Rep. Torres
himself. He declined to comment.
   House staffers say that partly because Rep. Torres was so
annoyed by Ms. Seger's activities, the committee version of
the bill didn't reflect any of the compromise language when
it was unveiled March 22. However, the Fed problems were
eliminated by a Republican-led amendment that passed despite
the opposition of Chairman Gonzalez and Mr. Torres.
   It's unclear whether Ms. Seger initiated the contact with
trade groups or whether she was recruited to the issue, but
there's no disputing her direct involvement.
   "Martha Seger intervened very heavily," said Stephen
Verdier, lobbyist for the Independent Bankers Association of
America. "Her basic position was that the whole provision was
lousy."
   Kenneth Guenther, executive vice president of the IBAA,
said he called Ms. Seger to enlist her support after learning
of Mr. Torres's proposal from congressional staffers.
   But Mr. Verdier, the IBAA lobbyist who worked on the
issue, said Ms. Seger herself alerted the organization to the
issue earlier in March during the association's convention in
San Francisco. "We'll take information wherever we can get
it," he said.
   "I see nothing improper or inappropriate at all," Mr.
Verdier added. "This is a person who knows the Fed and knows
community banking. It would be irresponsible of her to not
say something if she sees a potential problem in a piece of
legislation."

   A question for tax experts:
   Bonded Collection Service, of Longmont, Colo., has a
health-insurance plan whose beneficiaries are the firm's
owner, William Boettcher, two sons who work for him, and
about 20 other employees. Can Bonded deduct the costs of
insuring the three family members?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   No, said Mr. Boettcher's accountant.
   Outraged, Mr. Boettcher called the toll-free taxpayer
hotline. An Internal Revenue Service employee said the firm
could, in fact, deduct the costs for all three.
   Both were wrong, an IRS specialist ultimately told
Bonded's befuddled accountant, Thomas Brock. The sons' health
insurance could be deducted, but not Mr. Boettcher's.
   And the disagreements had only begun. Mr. Brock, the
accountant, turned to yet-another accountant, who sided with
the second IRS employee. Yet Mr. Brock still tells his client
that Bonded shouldn't take a chance by taking the deduction.
   Mr. Boettcher himself says he only wants to pay his taxes
-- "every penny I owe. But in this case," he adds, "it's so
totally unfair and so totally confusing that nobody knows."
   Does anybody really understand the U.S. tax code?
   As Americans scramble to meet Monday's deadline for filing
1989 income-tax returns, they are struggling to comply with a
tax law that has been altered, overhauled, nipped and tucked
in at least eight major pieces of legislation in the past 10
years. The law has become so comprehensive and so specific as
to be in many areas utterly baffling, not only to taxpayers
but also to their accountants and attorneys and to the civil
servants charged with administering it.
   Compounding the confusion are thousands of pages of IRS
regulations meant to tell taxpayers how to comply with the
law's intricacies. In its rules on so-called passive-loss
deductions, for example, the IRS defines the notion of
"activity" -- in 196 pages.
   The thicket of regulations has grown so dense that Rep.
William Archer, a Texas Republican who personally helped
write much of the nation's tax law, found last year that, for
the first time in his life, he couldn't figure his own income
tax.
   To be sure, millions of working Americans have found
preparing their returns far simpler in the past few years.
The sweeping revision of the tax code in 1986 substantially
increased the standard deduction, sparing many taxpayers the
chore of itemizing deductions, and removing millions of
low-income people from the tax rolls entirely. Between 1987
and 1988, according to the IRS, more than eight million
taxpayers switched from itemizing to using the standard
deduction.
   But for most of the seven million businesses that file
returns -- plus more than 30 million individuals who still
itemize -- compliance has never been more complex. Nor more
costly. Some accountants say they are charging as much as 2%
of a small firm's revenue simply to prepare a tax return.
   Some businesses are avoiding transactions purely to escape
the expense and burden of calculating the tax consequences.
One Ohio contractor, for example, decided against selling an
office building because the cost, complexity and uncertainty
of proving that it was, for tax purposes, an investment
property overwhelmed the benefits of the deal.
   "He decided he couldn't afford to go through with it,"
says the developer's accountant, Ronald Cohen. "The whole
system is totally out of control. It's made us very much more
profitable -- at the expense of our clients."
   Big business is also overwhelmed. It takes 2 1/2 hours for
a sophisticated computer at Dow Chemical Co. to complete one
calculation to satisfy IRS rules on allocating costs between
U.S. and foreign operations. Even the company's tax experts
are often confounded by the rules.
   "There are whole big areas that are so uncertain that we
go to our tax counsel and ask them and they say, `Darned if I
know,' " says Glenn White, who directs Dow Chemical's tax
department. "People in the business community are losing
confidence in the system."
   Taxpayers have long complained about the complexities.
Now, policy makers in Washington are beginning to echo the
outcry. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who
heads the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee,
recently ordered a study of ways to simplify the code.
Lawrence Gibbs, the IRS commissioner in the mid-1980s, cites
worries that complexity is pushing the system toward
breakdown. Many tax authorities, he says, are concerned that
"the tax law, in a large part, may no longer be administrable
by the Internal Revenue Service," he says, "and no longer
comprehensible by most taxpayers and many of their advisers."
   The problem is obvious to anyone glancing at the stack of
tax-code pages on employee benefits, rules that affect
multinational corporate giants and tiny companies alike --
and ultimately, of course, millions of working Americans.
   Every year since 1980, Congress has extensively changed
the laws governing private pension plans. The Association of
Private Pension and Welfare Plans says that, to distinguish
the employer from the employees, a firm must apply rules
concerning predecessor employees in section 414(a) of the tax
code; employees of a controlled group of corporations in
section 414(b) with a cross-reference to section 1563(a);
employees of partnerships under common control, as laid out
in section 414(c), with a cross-reference to Treasury
Regulation section 1.1563-1(d); employees of affiliated
service groups, as defined in section 414(m), and, not to be
forgotten, leased employees in section 414(n).
   All this occurs before a company tries to figure out which
of its employees are "highly compensated" under the code's
anti-discrimination rules. But watch out: "Compensation" is
defined differently in sections 414(s), 414(q)(7) and
415(c)(3), the pension association notes. A highly
compensated employee might make an annual salary of $75,000
or more. Or $50,000 or more. Or $45,000 or more. To determine
which, a company must run a series of complicated, costly
tests. Or, more likely, pay an outside firm to do it.
   In an effort to cut down on rising accountants' bills,
Vermont Marble Co., with 100 employees and a retirement
program, is updating some software to organize data better.
But for the most part, it's at the mercy of its
ever-more-expensive outside professionals. "Small-business
men are interested in running their business," says Thomas
Turner, Vermont Marble's treasurer and vice president of
finance. "They want to spend full time on that."
   Relying on outsiders has its own perils. "We, the
professionals, haven't a clue as to what the laws mean," says
Sam Gilbert, who runs United Plan Administrators, a small
pension-consulting firm in Sherman Oaks, Calif. Some pension
consultants tell him they simply ignore parts of the law.
"They say, `I've read it. I don't understand it.' We are
really encouraging noncompliance."
   The IRS itself concedes that complexity breeds evasion.
"If taxpayers cannot understand our laws, regulations and
administrative rules, or if compliance with those
requirements is prohibitively expensive, taxpayers will
engage in shortcuts and not fully comply," says IRS
Commissioner Fred Goldberg. The costs are stunning: A 1% drop
in compliance, he told Congress recently, costs the
government more than $5 billion in revenue.
   Attacking the problem, Mr. Goldberg has ordered IRS
lawyers to draft simpler, briefer regulations -- even if that
requires issuing rules that might neglect to address every
possible situation under the law.
   But the frenzy of tax legislation in recent years and
intricacy of some of the new statutes' requirements are
burying the IRS itself. Revenue agents must constantly
relearn the code in order to enforce it. And sorting through
the mounds of legislation, the agency's thousands of
attorneys have missed important deadlines in issuing
regulations implementing the law.
   Stuart Lewis, managing partner of Washington law firm
Silverstien &amp; Mullins, has frozen the pension plans of about
30 client companies because the IRS hasn't finished
regulations on part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act intended to
crack down on discriminatory retirement plans -- a statute
that went into effect Jan. 1, 1989. So, no money is being
paid into the plans.
   "I'm confident of the advice I give," says Mr. Lewis, an
expert on pension tax law. But because of the gaps in IRS
guidance, "sometimes the advice is that there's no answer to
the question."
   The code's growing complexity also is leading many top tax
practitioners to quit giving advice in whole areas of tax
law. No longer do most of the partners in Winthrop, Stimson,
Putnam &amp; Roberts, a high-powered Manhattan law firm, tackle a
pensiontax question. They leave it to Susan Serota, who heads
the firm's retirement and employee-benefits department, and
her legal team. "You really do have to be a specialist in the
area," she says. "I don't think a generalist would be
comfortable giving advice in the area anymore. Certainly none
of my partners do."
   But many tax authorities deplore specialization as
inefficient and harmful to the tax system.
   "Increasingly all my brethren in the bar are saying
there's just certain sections of the code I can't look at
anymore," says Gordon Henderson, the tax chief at Weil,
Gotshal &amp; Manges in New York. "More and more, we are becoming
narrower and narrower in our focus. That's an expensive way
to run a tax system."

   Piggies at Market: The Brazilian Paradigm

   Privatization, launched in the First World by Margaret
Thatcher and her team of "free-market" theocrats is now
raging through Latin America and Eastern Europe at precisely
the moment Mrs. Thatcher's popularity plummets to record lows
in the U.K. and Britain's economic "revival" turns out to be
hollow.
   From Mexico to Argentina to Warsaw economists trained in
the U.S. are pushing through drastic deflationary onslaughts
on old structures of state ownership and employment, on
subsidies and public patronage, and even on private assets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The "free-market" onslaught was promoted in its most
disastrously naked guise in Bolivia, where Harvard's Jeffrey
Sachs, now on retainer in Poland and Czechoslovakia, urged a
scorched-earth assault on hyperinflation. Under his direction
the state simply closed down, with huge chunks of the labor
force turned out on the streets and much significant economic
activity ceasing altogether. Inflation stopped, but so did
everything else, and soon Bolivia was urgently seeking advice
elsewhere on how to get things going again. Some Poles have
taken note of this sorry tale.
   A rather more ominous story is unfolding in Brazil, which,
in contrast to a Bolivian economy sustained mostly by coca
cultivation, is the eighth-largest economy in the world.
   In December, at the climax of a very tight race between
the Socialist Workers Party candidate, Lula, and the former
governor of the state of Alagoas, Fernando Collor de Mello,
victory was snatched by Mr. Collor, who had been denouncing
state corruption and who had seized some of Lula's lightning
by a populist message to Brazil's millions of desperately
poor.
   No sooner had Mr. Collor taken office in March than he
announced a savage program of retrenchment and deflation. His
plan implied one of the most abrupt attempts at
centralization of power in political memory, designed to give
him and his advisers discretionary powers over state and
private assets undreamed of by the military regime.
   Mr. Collor's deflationary plan, enacted March 16, one day
after he took office, was to freeze all bank accounts and
change the currency. All funds over approximately $1,000
would revert from the accounts in which they had been lodged
to named accounts in Brazil's Central Bank, where they would
remain for 18 months and then be paid back to their holders
in 12 monthly installments, tying up the confiscated funds
for more than two years.
   Whom did this confiscation affect? Most bank accounts are
the purview of Brazil's less wealthy -- shopkeepers,
unionized laborers, cab drivers, small businessmen, etc.
Those with more cash generally invested in Brazil's
"overnight" market in speculative bonds and currencies that
yielded rates well above inflation. Virtually all large
corporate groups held their millions in the "overnight"
market or took their money overseas.
   Mr. Collor and his economic team froze the "overnight" in
a manner quite different from the confiscation of checking
and savings accounts. Twenty percent of the assets in a given
"overnight" account could be reclaimed, while 80% would be
confiscated into the Central Bank for 18 months. As the
Brazilian economy went into shock and prices crashed, those
with any cash at all -- notably the 20% available to
"overnight" account holders -- were, relatively speaking, in
a position to take advantage of such opportunities as a stock
market that lost 60% of its value, or to purchase state
enterprises for sale at 30% of their value.
   Furthermore, people with substantial fortunes seized by
the government are already making arrangements to get their
money back, negotiating lucrative concessions and so forth.
In this sense, Mr. Collor's seizure of assets has amounted to
economic hostage-taking to consolidate his political base.
The more than $100 billion now concentrated in the Central
Bank fund is at the disposition of Mr. Collor, who will
decide which companies get their money back and on what
terms. This creates a tremendous potential for corruption.
   Mr. Collor has also struck down barriers to foreign
investment, permitting international investors to pick up
tempting portions of Brazil's crumbling economic masonry, as
well as mineral concessions, at bargain-basement prices. An
unconfirmed report in the Jornal do Brasil recently had
Japanese investors agreeing to assume responsibility for
Brazil's external debt in exchange for rights to all the gold
reserves in the Amazon. Simultaneously, he has cleared away
restrictions on imports, and this will further erode Brazil's
domestic economy.
   What has Mr. Collor's program meant in the short term?
There have been big layoffs, with more than 20,000 workers
idled inside a month. A large portion, up to 90% of the auto
and machine capacity of the state of Sao Paulo -- the
economic core of Brazil -- has closed down and more than
10,000 government employees are soon to be laid off. Banks
and businesses have failed by the dozen.
   Well-publicized arrests of jewelers, and supermarket and
business executives charged with various economic crimes,
have burnished Mr. Collor's populist image while the country
spirals into depression and its assets are thrown on the
international auction block. Mr. Collor's popularity is
running at 75% approval. The little guy is able to say that
at least he has the same bank balance -- $1,000 -- as the
richest man in Brazil, ignoring the situation of the
"overnight." This popularity is terrorizing Congress into
compliance. Brazil's powerful unions, which led the assault
against the military, now find themselves under direct
threat. Their gains had been most palpable within the
state-controlled steel and oil industries. But state
corporations -- notably Siderbras, the state steel industry
-- will soon be for sale, with new and hostile ownership in
view.
   Mr. Collor's program amounts to a form of fascism: abrupt
concentration of power in the executive, personal control
over allocation of resources in the economy, a scrim of
populist rhetoric.
   Mr. Collor's economic strategy is reform-by-dismemberment,
the model currently being essayed in Poland and nervously
heralded earlier this week in Moscow by Mikhail Gorbachev's
economic adviser, Leonid Abalkin. The plan outlined by Mr.
Abalkin and reported in the Western press on Tuesday
similarly looks to shutdown of state enterprises, untrammeled
foreign investment, mass unemployment, annulling of workers'
rights as the only way forward. Call that fascism, too, or
perhaps Market Stalinism, with "market discipline" imposed by
dictatorial fiat, the worst of both systems.
   So the newly emerging world model is not the notional
"free market" but authoritarian capitalism as dreamed of by
leaders from Santiago, Buenos Aires through London to
Beijing. For Mrs. Thatcher, a response came, violently, last
week in the form of protests against the poll tax. For the
leaders in Beijing, an answer came in Tiananmen Square. Mr.
Gorbachev awaits the retort of the Soviet working class. In
Latin America, moving from military fascism to market fascism
(or enduring both simultaneously), the fate of these
strategies will similarly be settled in the streets.

   BEIJING -- David Richter was struck by Beijing's
tranquility when he returned this month after two years in
the U.S.
   "The place seems great. It's humming along," says Mr.
Richter, a director of WJS Inc., a U.S.-based trading
company. "Frankly, I had expected people in Beijing to look a
lot more downtrodden and beaten."

   Call it the Beijing paradox. On the surface, China's
capital seems to be thriving as never before. Markets and
shops are overflowing with vegetables, meat and electronic
gadgets. People go about their business in a relaxed,
carefree manner. Things generally seem stable.
   For many visitors, the apparent normalcy doesn't jibe with
the enduring image they have of Beijing: the massacre last
June 4, when tanks and troops killed hundreds of protesters.
That image is reinforced today, 10 months later, by news
reports depicting Beijing's population as still chafing under
the strict control of a police state.
   So what's the real story?
   "Superficially, this place seems very normal," says a
Western diplomat and longtime China watcher. "But you only
have to scratch the surface ever so slightly to realize that
things are unstable to the core."
   That view is shared by many foreign analysts living in
Beijing, as well as by a large segment of the local
population.
   "The Communist Party irretrievably lost Beijing last
year," says a Chinese scholar, speaking on the condition of
anonymity. "An entire city now lies in wait for a chance to
rise up and avenge the massacre." In the meantime, the
scholar says, the Chinese plod along, practicing an art they
have mastered over the centuries: keeping their heads down.
   In her latest book, writer Bette Bao Lord, wife of the
former U.S. ambassador to Beijing, relates a Chinese friend's
comments immediately after last June's killings. China's
leaders, the friend warned, "are masters of orchestrating a
misery all the more insidious because it is silent and
invisible."
   Publicly, people are careful not to contradict the
official line: that last year's pro-democracy movement was
actually a "counterrevolutionary rebellion" organized by a
handful of criminals. Only in private do people express their
opinions, and they are nearly universally despairing.
   Despite the widespread grumbling, there seems to be only
one person among the country's 1.1 billion citizens who dares
speak out. He is Hou Dejian, a popular singer who, along with
three intellectuals, staged a hunger strike on Tiananmen
Square just before the troops stormed in. The 33-year-old,
who was born on Taiwan but holds a Chinese passport, risks
imprisonment for his outspokenness. He is gambling that his
fame will protect him.
   "There are two possibilities for China: peaceful evolution
or violent revolution," says Mr. Hou, who now spends his days
playing pool at a local hotel. "The Communist Party is
pushing China toward violent revolution. The longer they
resist people's desire for democracy, the more terrible the
result will be."
   If the apparent political calm is illusory, what about the
economy? Most foreign experts say the economy is in deep
trouble. But Chinese statistics suggest that, in some
respects, the economy is healthier than it was a year ago,
before the unrest. Annual inflation, which peaked last year
at about 30%, is down to 3.3%. And markets in major cities
are well stocked.
   But here again, appearances can be deceiving. The cost of
bringing down inflation has been zero or negative industrial
growth, and unemployment has reached record levels. Even the
abundance of supplies in shops and markets are cause for
alarm, some experts say.
   "The shelves are full because no one is buying," says a
Western economist. "If anything were to happen to spark
renewed panic buying, the shelves would be cleaned out in a
minute. And, since China's industry is dead, there would be
no stocks out there to replace them. That's when to start
worrying about major unrest."
   Another clue to the problems lurking beneath the surface,
analysts say, is the Chinese leadership's obsession with
"stability." To preserve it, controversial issues are simply
sidestepped. During the recent National People's Congress,
for example, delegates received clear signals that they
weren't to debate last year's turmoil and suppression.
Moreover, the Communist Party scrapped plans for major
personnel changes, apparently to preserve the pretext of
unity at the top.
   But despite frequent claims that everything is under
control, China's leaders this month revealed the extent of
their fears. In response to rumors that Beijing residents
might demonstrate on key anniversaries of last year's
protests, authorities dispatched troops, armed police and
plainclothes men to every corner of the city. They also
sealed off Tiananmen Square. And they sent convoys of
security forces around the city on motorcycles, police jeeps,
unmarked cars and bicycles.
   The initial anniversaries passed without incident. But
some disaffected Chinese view the government's overreaction
as a small victory. "The government blinked," says one young
intellectual.
   Beijing's uneasy calm is likely to prevail, most analysts
agree, until the death of Deng Xiaoping, who at 85 is still
thought to be China's supreme leader. Most assume that
intense jockeying for power in post-Deng China is already
under way. That struggle could well play itself out both
behind the walls of the Party's Zhongnanhai compound and by
the masses taking to the streets.

   Money Fund Yields
   Edged Up Slightly

<LP>
   Yields on money-market mutual funds edged up in the latest
week, remaining in the narrow range of the past three months.
   The average seven-day compound yield rose to 7.99% from
7.97%, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a
Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The yield has hovered near
8% since early this year. (Compound yields assume
reinvestment of dividends.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the 427 taxable funds tracked by Donoghue's
slipped by $44.7 million to $383.6 billion.
   Average maturity of the funds' investments, such things as
Treasury bills, bank certificates of deposit and commercial
paper (short-term corporate IOUs), remained at 45 days for
the third consecutive week.
   Maturities are considered a sign of which way portfolio
managers think interest rates are headed, with longer
maturities thought to signal declining rates and shorter
maturities considered a sign of rising rates. Average
maturities have been as short as 29 days and as long as 53
days in recent years.
   "The {interest} rate outlook has stayed very flat," said
Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Donoghue's. "Federal Reserve
policy doesn't seem to be changing in either direction."
Yields on CDs and T-bills also were little changed in the
latest week.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
rose to 7.69% from 7.67% in the week ended Tuesday, while the
average 30-day simple yield moved to 7.68% from 7.67%. The
average 30-day compound yield went to 7.98% from 7.97%.
   Yields on tax-exempt money funds remained flat. The
average seven-day compound yield was unchanged at 5.57%.
That's equal to a taxable yield of 7.74% for investors in the
28% federal income tax bracket, and 8.31% for those in the
33% bracket.
   Assets of the 220 tax-free funds tracked by Donoghue's
rose by $1.5 billion, to $78.8 billion. Ms. Negus attributed
the rise to tax concerns as the April 16 filing deadline
approaches.
   Average maturity of the tax-exempt funds remained at 46
days.

   Canada Orders
   Price Waterhouse
   To Have Review

   TORONTO -- The Canadian partnership of the accounting firm
Price Waterhouse was ordered by the Ontario Securities
Commission to submit to an independent review of its policies
on auditing public companies.
   The order was the result of a hearing in which commission
staff argued that Price Waterhouse failed to comply with
generally accepted auditing standards in its audit of the
fiscal 1987 financial statements of National Business Systems
Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As previously reported, the president of National Business
resigned in January 1988 after irregularities were found in
the company's 1987 financial statements. He and four other
former company executives subsequently were charged with
theft and fraud.
   In a negotiated settlement, Price Waterhouse agreed to
comply with the order, but it didn't admit or deny the
accuracy of commission staff's allegations and conclusions.
   Under the order, Price Waterhouse must retain a firm of
chartered accountants to review certain of its auditing
policies and procedures. Price Waterhouse must implement the
independent accountant's recommendations within three months
of receiving its report, and must pay 70,000 Canadian dollars
(US$59,900) toward the cost of the commission hearing.
   The order is the first of its kind from the commission,
said Brenda Eprile, associate chief accountant. It indicates
the commission's willingness to investigate allegations that
generally accepted auditing standards haven't been followed
during the audit of a public company, she said.
   "We felt this was a major case," Ms. Eprile said.
   In a statement, Price Waterhouse said the "great majority"
of changes made to the original 1987 financial statements of
National Business "reflected a massive management fraud
involving certain of the former senior {National Business}
executives" and others. It said the items that resulted in
changes to the financial statements occurred in the company's
Canadian operations for which Greenwood Cook &amp; Co., an
accounting firm based in Mississauga, had primary
responsibility.
   Commission staff said the relationship between Price
Waterhouse and Greenwood Cook during the 1987 audit of
National Business was "unclear." But Price Waterhouse was the
auditor of record and signed the financial statements, Ms.
Eprile said.
   In a letter sent to the commission last month, Price
Waterhouse said it believed that Robert Greenwood, a partner
at Greenwood Cook, received certain payments made privately
by the former president of National Business while Greenwood
Cook was auditing National Business' statements.
   Mr. Greenwood declined to comment. In a letter sent to the
commission, Greenwood Cook said it objected to publication of
the settlement agreement between the commission and Price
Waterhouse because certain allegations concerning Greenwood
Cook are "inaccurate."
   National Business Systems, based in Mississauga, Ontario,
supplies plastic transaction card machines and related
equipment. Hees International Bancorp Inc., a Toronto
merchant bank and management and investment services concern
controlled by brothers Peter and Edward Bronfman, assumed
management of National Business in 1988.

   Making Vacation Travel
   Less Free and Easy

   WHEN AIRLINES start looking for travelers to stick with
higher fares, business passengers usually get stuck first.
This year, though, the airlines seem to have a new target:
vacationers.
   Restricted coach fares, which vacation travelers rely on,
are 10% higher than a year ago, according to an April 1
survey of fares by American Express Travel Related Services
Inc. By contrast, the discount coach fares that business
people use most have climbed only 3%.
   Some of the vacation-travel increases are substantial. The
cheapest fare this year between New York and Minneapolis was
$156 each way on April 1, based on round-trip purchase -- or
25% higher than a year earlier. The best deal from Los
Angeles to Dallas is 21% higher. From New York to Washington,
the lowest leisure fare has jumped 68% to $99 one way.
   Hitting business people with the brunt of air-fare
increases is a time-honored tradition. After all, though
vacationers can dig in the garden rather than fly to Hawaii
if fares rise, most business people must travel. Or so the
theory goes.
   But airlines are concerned that many companies are cutting
back on travel, some analysts say. And more corporations are
striking special discount-fare arrangements with airlines.
So, carriers are compensating by boosting leisure fares --
though not so much, they hope, that they scare off the
vacation-bound.
   "You can only raise the business fares so high," says
Ignacio Maza, director of air-fare management for American
Express.
                                                                                                       

   Car-Rental Customers
   Yield Some Privacy
                                                                                                       

   TO RENT A CAR, it may no longer be enough to show that you
have a driver's license and credit card. You may also need a
clean driving record.
   In a controversial move, some smaller car-rental companies
are running background checks on drivers who rent for long
periods to see if they've had any serious violations. They
say such checks are both legal and smart. "I'm just trying to
protect my business," says Howard Kirmsse, president of a
Rent-A-Wreck franchise in Cherry Hill, N.J.
   But such checks make privacy specialists nervous. For one
thing, the data-base companies that do the checking aren't
always accurate, they say. Also, a rental company doesn't
usually tell customers they're being scrutinized. Evan
Hendricks, editor of Privacy Times, says: "It's not illegal,
but I have a real problem with people being checked out
behind their backs."
   The biggest car-rental companies say they don't make such
checks, in part because they still take too long. But with
improved technology, that could change. "It's not a bad
idea," says James Philion, president of Thrifty Rent-A-Car
System Inc.
   For now, poring over motor-vehicle records can take up to
a week, which is why Mr. Kirmsse checks only drivers who are
keeping his car for more than a month. So far, he says, he
hasn't had to contact a customer and ask for a car back. But
he says he might do so if he discovers a driver has a
conviction for driving while intoxicated.

   MAYBE ALL THOSE fattening airline meals have something to
do with it, but the airline industry has decided that
Americans are putting on a few pounds.
   Several domestic and foreign airlines are planning to
raise the standard weight figure they use for passengers in
determining the total loaded weight of any aircraft. It's
about time. Under the current U.S. standard -- which hasn't
changed since 1946 -- the "average" traveler weighs 160
pounds in the summer and, with an allowance for heavier
clothing, 165 pounds in the winter.
   This has raised a few chuckles in the industry. "Did they
decide this after looking at me?" asks one airline executive.
But in reality, this is an important issue for airlines. By
law, airplanes can't take off if they're too heavy, so the
weight of everything aboard must be calculated -- down to the
laminated safety cards. The weight must also be carefully
distributed.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which sets the U.S.
standard, says it plans to revise the figure "a bit upward"
because of some accidents involving uneven passenger
weighting and studies of actual passenger weights. British
Airways recently raised its weight estimate by one kilogram,
or 2.2 pounds.
   Most airlines are also factoring in more weight for the
carry-on luggage. Each passenger hauls about five pounds of
carry-on bags, airlines say. And United Airlines estimates
that 80% of all its passengers now carry some luggage on
board, up from 36% in the 1950s.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   NOBODY'S GETTING any overtime for it, but 43% of all
business fliers travel for work outside of normal business
hours of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. And 16% of them start their trips
on weekends, according to an analysis of 52,000 travelers by
Associated Travel Management in Santa Ana, Calif. . . . Even
Donald Trump can't control the weather. Right after he began
offering an on-time guarantee on the Trump Shuttle last
month, heavy fog and rain hit Boston and New York. The
airline had promised to compensate customers whose flights
were late with tickets good for free weekend travel by a
companion. In the first week of the promotion, the shuttle's
on-time record fell to 80% from the usual 90%, a Trump
spokeswoman says; in 17 days, the airline gave away 15,000
awards.

   Murdoch Seeks Strength From Within

   NEW YORK -- After a 1980s buying binge that built News
Corp. into a global giant but saddled it with more than $6
billion in debt, Rupert Murdoch says it's time for his
company to forgo major acquisitions, prop up plunging
earnings and focus on its current stable of entertainment and
media businesses.
   But Mr. Murdoch, chairman and chief executive officer of
the Australia-based media company, denies that he is under
any pressure to make major asset sales. Instead, he says, he
will sell some properties on a selective basis, and may take
on partners in some businesses such as movie production to
raise cash. He aims to focus his personal attention on Sky
Television, the nascent British satellite-TV service that he
says has accumulated operating losses of more than #250
million ($411 million); he expects it to have losses of #100
million more before reaching break-even in late 1991.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the meantime, Mr. Murdoch vows to make no major
acquisitions for the next two to three years. That marks a
big retrenchment for the acquisitive media magnate, who piled
up debt to acquire the Twentieth Century Fox movie studio and
Metromedia TV stations, build the Fox TV network, and buy
publishing properties such as Harper &amp; Row and TV Guide.
Right now, he says, nothing whets his appetite.
   "We're going to grow organically," Mr. Murdoch says in an
interview. "We've got to restore and {increase} our profits
before we can look at any major purchases."
   Rebuilding profits will take some doing, particularly with
a heavy debt burden. Largely because of losses associated
with Sky Television, operating profits will probably plunge
40% to 50% in the fiscal year ending June 30, Mr. Murdoch
concedes.
   But he remains fiercely optimistic about Sky's chances for
success. The four-channel service has a one-year head start
on rival British Satellite Broadcasting Corp., and Mr.
Murdoch says it has over one million viewers in the U.K. --
450,000 of those paying subscribers to the scrambled movie
portion of the service. By the second half of next year, he
predicts, it will have two million paying subscribers; Sky is
installing new equipment in homes at a rate of 20,000 a week,
according to Mr. Murdoch. Longer term, he is optimistic as
well about News Corp.'s partnership in an ambitious venture
in the U.S., Sky Cable, which aims to deliver 108 channels of
programming directly to homes here.
   Still, for an executive who has rarely suffered setbacks,
Mr. Murdoch's wings have been clipped, particularly by the
failure of his plan to create a second company he referred to
as "Son of News Corp." Last year, Credit Suisse First Boston
Corp. tried to raise $1 billion for the new company in a
private placement; News Corp. planned to transfer its book
publishing assets to the new company, thereby lowering News
Corp.'s debt and giving it a vehicle to build yet another
media giant.
   "We failed to make the thing fly," says Mr. Murdoch, who
notes that Credit Suisse was able to line up only half the
funding he sought. As a result, News Corp.'s debt will
actually increase later this year because it has to take its
Harper &amp; Collins book publishing operations back onto its
balance sheet; after News Corp. sells $500 million to $600
million of book publishing assets, total News Corp. debt will
rise to $6.5 billion from $6.1 billion now.
   Investors are encouraged by some of Mr. Murdoch's recent
moves, such as his decision to sell the tabloid magazine the
Star to G.P. Group Inc., publisher of the National Enquirer,
for $400 million in cash and preferred stock. "I don't think
shareholders are looking for distress sales, but selling the
Star was a good move," says Karen Firestone, a money manager
at Fidelity Management &amp; Research Corp. in Boston. "News
Corp. has placed its bets in a few key businesses such as
film production, broadcasting, satellite distribution, and
newspaper publishing, and businesses that are extraneous
should be divested where appropriate."
   John Reidy, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co., agrees. "I think this is a time for a complete
reappraisal of the portfolio," he says. "The only thing
that's surprising is that there haven't been more
transactions." Mr. Reidy blames uncertainty over the extent
of losses at Sky TV and concern about debt for the poor
performance of News Corp.'s stock; the company's American
depositary receipts have been trading near their 52-week low
recently.
   But Ms. Firestone and Mr. Reidy agree that News Corp. is
still uniquely positioned to grow internally. "Murdoch has
been able to start numerous businesses such as the Fox
network from scratch, and do some things no one ever expected
he could," says Ms. Firestone. "If he just works on what he's
got without starting another venture somewhere, maybe the
market will begin to respond."
   Indeed, there's plenty to work on internally. Mr.
Murdoch's forecast that Sky will be profitable within two to
three years could turn out to be optimistic if new rivals
such as British Satellite Broadcasting fare better than Mr.
Murdoch expects. A tough economy in the U.K. may hurt his
newspaper business, where he has continued to invest heavily
in modernization and expansion. The U.S. advertising climate
remains difficult for News Corp.'s magazines, and analysts
say some may be prime candidates for sale.
   While Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller has focused on
building the Fox TV network, the Fox movie studio has been
among the industry's poorest performers at the box office.
Last year, Fox released 17 movies but had only 6.3% of the
box office, ranking it seventh among the eight major studios.
Last summer, Joe Roth, an established independent producer,
was brought in to head the studio, and he has put more than
25 movies into production. "I'm confident now that we've got
a terrific guy running it," says Mr. Murdoch. As reported,
News Corp. is also in talks with Japanese investors who may
provide cash to start a "satellite" movie-production company
under the Fox banner, he says.
   The Fox network, meanwhile, is expected to post its first
profit for the full fiscal year. Fox Broadcasting Co., the
network entity, may post pretax operating profit of $38
million for the year ending June 30, after losses of $2
million a year ago and $100 million two years ago, Mr.
Murdoch says.
   The network's improving ratings -- its huge cartoon hit
"The Simpsons" is the nation's No. 1 show among 12 to 24 year
olds -- have helped Fox's group of seven TV stations. Fox
Television Stations Inc. will post pre-tax earnings of
perhaps $140 million before paying interest on $1.45 billion
that News Corp. borrowed to buy the stations; profits will be
about $20 million after interest, Mr. Murdoch estimates.
   Fox now airs programs three nights a week and plans to add
other nights, children's cartoons and a national newscast.
But first, federal regulators must agree with Fox's request
that it be exempted from regulations blocking the Big Three
networks from the rerun business, a lucrative source of
revenue for Fox.
   Mr. Murdoch says the Fox network and the studio will
eventually be important suppliers of programming for News
Corp.'s direct-broadcast satellite ventures, both in the U.S.
and in Britain. Fox, for example, already has plans on the
drawing board for another program network that could be
delivered via satellite or cable in the U.S.
   For the time being, analysts say, Mr. Murdoch must focus
his efforts on stemming the losses at Sky TV -- and girding
for competition from British Satellite Broadcasting. Mr.
Murdoch says Sky Television takes in net subscriber revenue
of only #700,000 a week but hopes it can grow to #1.7 million
a week by year end. Mr. Murdoch insists that the venture can
turn profits of #100 million a year by 1993.
   For now, Sky TV in the U.K. "remains our absolute No. 1
priority," Mr. Murdoch says. "That has taken a lot of money
and attention, and we have to see that through."

   NEW YORK -- Thomas G. Hopkins was named vice chairman of
Limited Inc., a post that has been vacant since Robert
Morosky resigned as vice chairman and chief financial officer
three years ago.
   Despite his new title, the 57-year-old Mr. Hopkins doesn't
appear to be the heir apparent to Leslie Wexner, Limited's
53-year-old chairman, president and chief executive.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to those familiar with the situation, the new
designation is formal acknowledgement of the additional
operating responsibilities Mr. Hopkins has assumed in recent
years. Since 1982, Mr. Hopkins has served as executive vice
president, organizational development.
   "I don't think heir apparent is an operative term in
Columbus, Ohio," said William N. Smith, an analyst at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham Inc. "Mr. Wexner has done an excellent
job of developing a management team, but I don't see him
stepping down in the near future."
   At the same time, Limited named Mr. Hopkins and Kenneth B.
Gilman, executive vice president and chief financial officer,
to the company's board. Limited will now have 13 board
members.
   Apparently determined to avoid naming a clear No. 2
executive, Mr. Wexner told one associate yesterday that "Ken
and Tom are my right hand and my left hand, but I'm
ambidextrous."
   When Mr. Morosky served as vice chairman, he was
considered Mr. Wexner's most likely successor at the
retailing giant. However, after Mr. Morosky resigned, many of
his responsibilities were delegated to others. Company
presidents now supervise their own information systems and
distribution centers, and Mr. Morosky's role as the Limited's
top financial executive has been assumed by Mr. Gilman.

   Iran's Economy -- Hostage to the Hostages' Fate

   While the freeing by the pro-Libyan Fatah Revolutionary
Council of a Frenchwoman, her Belgian companion and their
child born in captivity is welcome news, it has no bearing on
the fate of the 17 American and European hostages held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
   In Iran, following promising media reports earlier this
year of an imminent release of one or more American hostages,
a stalemate continues between pro- and anti-release
politicians. However, the balance of forces may now be
shifting toward the moderates, which holds the possibility of
the release of an American hostage in the next few weeks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On one side is pragmatic President Ali Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani. On the other, hardliner Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, a
former Interior Minister and now a powerful member of the
Iranian Parliament.
   The raison d'etre for abducting Westerners in Lebanon
disappeared when the war between Iran and Iraq ended in
August 1988. The pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon had used this
tactic to inhibit the U.S. from mounting direct attacks on
Iranian targets during the Gulf War. The price of any such
action would have been the execution of one or more of the
American and British captives (particularly Terry Waite, a
Briton who had received much publicity trying to secure the
release of American hostages). That this was a real threat
became clear when, following the American raid on the Libyan
capital in April 1986 by U.S. warplanes based in Britain, two
British hostages were reportedly "bought" by the Libyan
leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, and executed.
   Mr. Rafsanjani rightly considers the resolution of the
hostage crisis as the essential first step toward normalizing
relations with major Western nations, particularly the U.S.,
in order to improve the beleaguered Iranian economy. To
strengthen his case, Mr. Rafsanjani approached Sheik Muhammad
Hussein Fadlallah, the leading ideologue of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, to endorse his stance. He did
so by publicly urging the unconditional release of Western
hostages.
   Encouraged by this, Ali Muhammad Besharati, Iran's deputy
foreign minister, told the pro-Rafsanjani Tehran Times on
March 18 that all Western hostages held in Lebanon could be
free by next January, and that such a development would be
gradual.
   But Mr. Mohtashemi continues to oppose the move. At his
behest a majority of parliamentary deputies urged the
government, on March 20, to refrain from negotiating to gain
freedom for the Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Moreover, Mr. Mohtashemi has as much influence, if not
more, over the Lebanese captors as does Sheik Fadlallah. As
the Iranian ambassador in Damascus, Syria, in the mid-1980s,
Mr. Mohtashemi was instrumental in establishing militant
Shiite groups in Lebanon, which among other things resorted
to abducting Westerners.
   Mr. Mohtashemi argues that once the Western powers have
recovered all their hostages, they will wreak bloody
vengeance on those responsible for their incarceration, and
the latter will have nothing to retaliate with.
   But a hostage release need not lead to violent
retaliation. One way in which the abductors can protect
themselves is by agreeing to release their captives in ones
and twos over a period of many months. This would allow the
Western governments and their citizens to dissipate their
accumulated frustration and anger gradually, and slide into
the mood of "Let bygones be bygones."
   Also, of the five groups involved in hostage-taking, a
couple are amenable to pressures from Mr. Rafsanjani. As for
the recalcitrant ones, they can be brought into line with the
threat of terminating the subsidies they receive from Tehran.
   On balance, therefore, the release of an American hostage
during the next few weeks is not unlikely, particularly when
the Tehran Times yesterday called for the unconditional
release of the hostages. This will be a useful trial balloon
for all the concerned parties.
   The crucial element in this long-running saga is the quiet
persistence with which Mr. Rafsanjani has pursued this matter
since assuming presidential office last August. He sees the
resolution of the hostage issue as an integral part of his
strategy to repair Iran's faltering economy.
   With inflation at 60% and unemployment at 25%, the Iranian
economy is in a deplorable state. According to official
sources, based on the fixed prices of 1974, per-capita income
was halved between 1978 and 1988. Part of the reason for this
decline lies with the population growth rate of 3.4%, one of
the highest in the world.
   "While Ayatollah Khomeini was alive and the war was on,
the regime constantly urged the faithful to fight for Islam,
and think of the `hereafter,'" said Irfan Parvez, executive
editor of the Tehran Times. "But now Rasfanjani wants to
stress the `here.' And he knows that to repair the economy we
need assistance from abroad."
   Mr. Rafsanjani knows too that there is no longer the
charismatic figure of Ayatollah Khomeini to inspire the
masses to suffer economic deprivation in the name of the
sacred cause of Islam and Islamic revolution. He therefore
has no choice but to tackle the economic crisis.
   He is making headway. After many months of skillful
lobbying he finally managed to secure parliamentary approval
for the $433 billion Five Year Plan for 1989-93. It assumes
foreign loans of $27 billion. This is a comparatively modest
share of the plan, and shows that Mr. Rafsanjani took into
account the opposition that radical parliamentarians maintain
toward foreign credits. They fear that economic dependence on
outside powers would undermine Iran's political independence,
which is widely regarded as the Islamic revolution's major
attainment.
   In the domestic economy, the radicals favor a strong
public sector. They also want to provide incentives to local
capital to invest in manufacturing rather than in trade.
Aware of this, the Rafsanjani administration recently offered
publicly owned mines for sale to the private sector. So far
the response has been poor, mainly because the prospective
private buyers are unsure that they would have adequate
access to electric power and foreign exchange for buying
machinery and spare parts for the mines.
   The ease with which hard currencies can be obtained by
Iranians depends on how well-disposed Western governments and
financial institutions are toward Iran. They, in turn, are
monitoring the progress of the Rafsanjani camp in
consolidating its hold over the political and economic
institutions of the state.
   Nothing would signal the advance of the Rafsanjani camp
more convincingly to Western capitals than its success in
securing the release of Western hostages in Lebanon --
gradually or precipitately.

   PENTAGON CONTRACTORS embroiled in scandals can still get
contracts.
   Fewer than 20% of the large defense firms convicted of
corrupt activities in the past year have been cut off from
any of their lucrative military business. Boeing Co., Grumman
Corp., Raytheon Co. and General Motors Corp.'s Hughes
Aircraft unit, among others, pleaded guilty to illegal
information-swapping on the condition that prosecutors
recommend they remain eligible for contracts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Investigators say the law doesn't permit suspension from
bidding unless a firm refuses to cooperate with prosecutors
and balks at imposing tighter management controls. Thus,
deciding to plead guilty "is strictly a money issue for the
corporations," says Washington defense attorney Joseph
Covington. He says fighting the charges may make the Pentagon
get tougher.
   Worried that industry has been let off too easy, the House
Energy and Judiciary committees demand more data on recent
criminal settlements.
                                                                                                       

   SMALL SUBCONTRACTORS say they'll feel defense cutbacks
first and worst.
   Small high-technology firms that subcontract with major
defense companies expect many of their contracts to be
dropped or canceled as the defense budget is chopped over the
next few years. If a rumored freeze on defense spending
occurs, "small businesses will be hurt first," says Donald
Grigg of the Association of Small Research Engineering and
Technical Services Companies.
   Prime contractors, facing cuts, typically try to keep
business in-house, thus keeping cash flowing through their
companies. When major firms subcontract work, "they're
talking millions or tens of millions of dollars," says Walter
Landauer of Purvis Systems, Westbury, N.Y. Top military
contractors are even cutting out midsized subcontractors, he
says.
                                                                                                       

   WALL STREET retreats from the defense industry.
   Major securities firms are abandoning defense company
research, figuring no one wants to buy stocks in a declining
industry. Dean Witter reassigns its defense analyst to
telecommunications. Merrill Lynch isn't replacing a defense
analyst, who left last year. Those who haven't been
reassigned outright are picking up new responsibilities. "You
can only tell people to sell stocks for so long," says Philip
Friedman of PaineWebber, who picked up telecommunications.
   Wall Street's own woes contribute to the trend, pressuring
firms to direct research at areas that will generate
business. "Clients don't have any interest in this group,"
says William Deatherage, Dean Witter's former defense
analyst. Moreover, Pentagon spending pressures and
Perestroika make a turnaround unlikely for several years.
   The Street continues to cover firms that cater mostly to
the booming commercial aerospace industry, even issuing buy
recommendations on some.
                                                                                                       

   AN ETHICS PROGRAM at General Dynamics Corp., launched in
1985 at Navy prodding, gets 5,000 "communications" a year
from employees, most seeking advice or information; about 10%
lead to investigations. The program, run by 32 directors,
seeks to educate, not "catch people."
                                                                                                       

   LONG-DISTANCE contacts between service personnel and their
children get a boost. Positive Parenting Inc., Phoenix,
markets a kit containing writing tips, colorful paper, and a
special calendar. "When men write to a child, they often
don't know what to write about," says creator Melanie Rahn.
                                                                                                       

   SAVING 40,000 JOBS is the goal of the first
military-to-civilian conversion law, in Washington state,
where over 200,000 jobs are defense-linked. The legislature
allocated $200,000 for an office to help defense-reliant
firms diversify and to retrain workers.
                                                                                                       

   TIGHT MILITARY BUDGETS make for strange bedfellows.
   Worried about having to shoulder the cost of huge
weapons-development projects alone, defense contractors
consider more joint ventures. "We've done a lot of teaming,
and we've put arrangements in place to do more," says James
Cunnane, General Dynamics Corp.'s chief financial officer.
The St. Louis company and neighbor McDonnell Douglas Corp.
team on the Navy's Advanced Tactical Aircraft, designed to
replace the aging A-6.
   Bidding for the Air Force's next-generation Advanced
Tactical Fighter, Lockheed Corp., Boeing Co. and General
Dynamics take on Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas. The
Army's LH helicopter pits McDonnell Douglas and Textron
Inc.'s Bell division vs. Boeing and United Technologies
Corp.'s Sikorsky unit. Rivals General Motors Corp. and Texas
Instruments Inc. join to build avionics subsystems.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: Army Times Publishing Co. says a greater
proportion of military personnel -- 34.5% -- invests in the
stock market, compared with 25.7% for U.S. households. . . .
With scant job placement services, the military academies are
ill-prepared to help the rising number of graduates expected
to quit the military in the wake of declining East-West
tensions. Result: Academy Graduates Executive Search Inc. now
counsels 900 officers, up from 100 five years ago.

   Meager Peace Dividend for Soviets

   The potential Soviet "peace dividend" is very large
relative to that of the U.S., yet its effect in raising
living standards for the average Soviet consumer probably
will be surprisingly small.
   Spending on the military and security-related purposes as
a percentage of Soviet GNP has been variously estimated as 9%
(by Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov), 16% (by the CIA),
and about 25% (by a small group of independent scholars,
sometimes referred to outside and inside government as "Team
B").
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has already announced
cuts in that spending of some 14.2% spread over the next few
years. In fact, even a 25% cut in defense spending -- a cut
twice as large as that which Mr. Gorbachev is offering --
will provide little improvement for the Soviet consumer.
Here's why.
   Assuming a national security budget of 20% of GNP (a
figure between the Team B and CIA estimates), transferring
one quarter of it from national security would make an
additional 5% of GNP available for civilian purposes. At
present, civilian consumption in the Soviet Union takes
something between 50% and 55% of GNP. So the 5% of GNP
transferred from the military to consumers would boost their
share of the economy to between 55% and 60.5% -- permitting
them collectively to consume a total of 10% more than they do
now.
   But that 10% raise is to be phased in over four years.
Collective civilian consumption could therefore grow by just
2.25% annually. Unfortunately, the Soviet population is
simultaneously growing at an annual rate of 1%. So even with
very optimistic assumptions about the size and the speed of
defense budget cuts, the average Soviet citizen is looking at
no more than a 1.25% annual increase in his or her personal
consumption, for a cumulative individual increase of 5% by
1995.
   In dollar terms, that projected increase looks even worse.
Soviet per-capita consumption is about $3,000 --
approximately the same as that of Mexico and Turkey. An
additional 1.25% a year translates into added consumption of
about $40, or $160 over four years.
   Worse, this would be a one-time increase. In the absence
of other changes in the Soviet economy, Soviet consumption
would settle at this plateau. If part of the "dividend" were
devoted to investment in consumer goods industry rather than
to raising consumption directly, the initial boost to
consumption would be smaller than the previous estimate, but
prospects for further growth after 1995 would be greater.
   To be sure, these calculations assume that the economic
aspects of "perestroika" remain about as unsuccessful as they
have been for most of Mr. Gorbachev's tenure since 1985. If
on the other hand, significant reforms do occur with respect
to price deregulation, control of the money supply,
imposition of fiscal discipline, privatization of state
enterprises (perhaps to absorb a substantial part of the
so-called ruble "overhang" of about 400-500 billion rubles),
property rights reform and currency convertibility, prospects
for significant betterment of the consumer's lot would be
substantially improved -- even in the absence of as large a
"peace dividend" from military cuts as I have assumed.
   Of course, the Soviets do have other options. A
combination of military cuts and economic reform would be
more likely to produce substantial benefits for the Soviet
consumer than either alone. But, by itself, the "peace
dividend" won't do very much.
   So systemic economic reform is required. Unfortunately,
the Soviet record on this score has been unimpressive.
Without significant economic reform, assistance by foreign
governments is likely to be wasted, while loans or
investments by foreign businesses are likely to be risky and
unrewarding.

   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded
credit ratings on U.S. companies four times more often than
it upgraded them during the first quarter.
   The credit-rating service issued lowered marks on some $75
billion of debt held by 95 corporations in the quarter,
citing such factors as declining real-estate values and the
rising debt obligations of many speculative-grade companies.
Moody's said 23 companies with $26 billion of debt were given
improved ratings in the same period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Financial-services concerns such as banks, thrifts and
securities firms had the sharpest declines in credit ratings,
Moody's said, with 43 companies receiving lower marks.
   The rating service said the current rate of downgrades is
unlikely to slow much this year.

   Harsco Is Urged
   To Sell Line, Pay
   Special Dividend

   An investor group led by former Secretary of Defense Frank
Carlucci and the Mellon family proposed that Harsco Corp.
sell off its defense operations and pay a special cash
dividend.
   The group, HC Partners of Washington, D.C., offered to
invest at least $100 million and possibly as much as $200
million in the Camp Hill, Pa., construction, defense and
industrial concern as part of the proposed restructuring. The
additional $100 million, if provided, would be targeted to
accelerate Harsco's world-wide research, development and
marketing efforts, the group said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   HC Partners, controlled by the Carlyle Group, a merchant
bank partly owned by the Mellon family of Pittsburgh, began
accumulating a stake in Harsco last October and now owns
about 1.9 million shares, or approximately 7%. That stake
would increase with the proposed cash infusion. But a
spokesman for the Carlyle Group declined to specify how much
the investors expect to own if the proposal is accepted by
Harsco.
   Harsco declined to comment on the proposal or on whether
its board and management will meet with the investors. Mr.
Carlucci, vice chairman of Carlyle, has requested that a
meeting take place before the annual meeting April 24.
   The investors' plan calls for Harsco to pay a special
dividend of $15 a share. The dividend would be financed
through a combination of borrowing $300 million through
Harsco's existing credit agreements and at least $100 million
from HC Partners.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Harsco closed at $25.50, up 12.5 cents.
   The plan calls for Harsco to get out of its troubled
defense businesses, which include the manufacture of such
military hardware as howitzers, field-artillery support
vehicles and armored earthmovers.
   Although analysts say the plan makes sense because it
would allow Harsco to focus on its more profitable
industrial-services and engineered-products units, they
question whether Harsco could find a buyer for the defense
group.
   "If Harsco would've been able to accomplish that, the
company would've done it already," said David S. Moore,
analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in New York.
   Harsco's defense businesses have been plagued by
production problems at its Marysville, Ohio, plant, where it
builds five-ton trucks for the Army. And the company hasn't
been able to renegotiate prices on some Army contracts, so
production costs have exceeded the sale price.
   Those problems have forced Harsco to take substantial
provisions for losses, pushing fiscal 1989 net income down
63% from the year earlier to $11.4 million, or 43 cents a
share. Sales rose 6% to $1.35 billion.

   PHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia Electric Co. said its annual
earnings will be reduced nearly $1 a share if state
regulators adopt a proposed $300 million reduction in the
company's pending rate request. In 1989, the company earned
$590 million, or $2.36 a share.
   Joseph F. Paquette Jr., chairman and chief executive
officer, said the expected rate reduction would also require
a one-time write-off of $1.20 a share during 1990 and a cut
in the dividend rate. Directors are expected to review the
dividend rate, currently $2.20 annually, April 23.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Philadelphia Electric closed at $17, down 12.5 cents.
   The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission indicated
during preliminary polling last month that it was proposing a
rate increase of about $250 million, or less than half of
Philadelphia Electric's $549 million request. Two
administrative law judges earlier recommended a rate increase
of only $117 million. A final decision is expected next
Thursday.
   Analyst Edward J. Tirello of Shearson Lehman Hutton said
he estimates 1990 earnings of around $1.80 a share, based on
a rate increase of $250 million. He said the estimate takes
into account cost-cutting measures that Mr. Paquette is
expected to announce soon. Mr. Tirello said he expects the
annual dividend rate to be cut to about $1.45, which would
reduce the yield to between 8% and 8.5%. The company declined
to comment on the estimates.

   East German Fears on Coming Merger
   Help Unite New Government's Factions

   BONN -- East Germany's first democratically elected
government is shaping up as a more formidable negotiating
partner than West Germans expected.
   In the wake of last month's election, East Germans
appeared eager to unify with their Western cousins. They
still are. But East German enthusiasm for unity is now
tempered with a growing sense that they'll have to guard
their own interests along the way, because nobody else will.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This realization helped pull together the East's
squabbling political factions, which have now put the final
touches on a ruling coalition. After three weeks of
wrangling, the East Germans last night announced they had
cleared the last hurdles to a "grand coalition" made up of
conservatives, Social Democrats, and a small coalition of
liberal parties.
   The new government is expected to be formally endorsed by
the East German parliament today. Without a legitimate East
German government, there was nobody for the West Germans to
negotiate with over a future monetary union. Similarly, the
so-called two-plus-four talks, involving the two Germanys and
the four victorious wartime allies, the U.S., France, Britain
and the Soviet Union, can now start working on the
international aspects of German unity.
   The strength of East Berlin's negotiating position hinges
on the ability of the East German parties to pull together.
In this regard, the new government seems to be off to a
strong start. East Germany's conservative premier-designate,
Lothar de Maiziere, led negotiations with the center-left
Social Democrats that often seemed snarled over differing
views on the pace and conditions of German unity. The Social
Democrats favor a slow approach, while the conservatives want
utmost speed toward a merger. In the end, the two sides were
able to compromise.
   The Social Democrats, for instance, want to shift
ownership of state-owned companies to workers, while the
Christian Democrats want to sell them to anyone. As a partial
solution, the two sides agreed that the property of East
German citizens should be protected for 10 years, and that
East Germans should have first crack at companies about to be
privatized.
   Forming unified positions on such sensitive topics is
crucial, because it allows the East Germans to speak with one
voice when negotiating with Bonn. Mr. de Maiziere's
conservative alliance got enough votes to build a majority
without the Social Democrats, but it needs a two-thirds
majority in parliament to push through the constitutional
changes necessary to clear the way for unification.
   East Germany's new leaders share many of the same goals as
their West German counterparts, but the government now
emerging has shown it can flex its muscles. Nowhere is this
more visible than in the explosive dispute over the exchange
rate for the East German mark.
   East Germans were jolted last week when the Bonn
government appeared to backtrack on earlier promises of a
generous one-to-one exchange rate for their currency,
favoring instead a West German Bundesbank plan to convert
only 2,000 marks at this rate with the rest exchanged at a
less-favorable two-to-one rate. The West Germans never
promised a sweeping one-to-one conversion, but East Germans
had come to expect it.
   East Germans took to the streets to protest the lower rate
and, in a sharp break with the tone of the election campaign,
aimed their ire specifically at West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl. The uproar gave East Berlin a new sense of its own
power, because it showed that East Germans would actively
support its positions, even if they seemed to throw barriers
in the path of early unification.
   The dispute helped the East German parties move toward
compromise. Mr. de Maiziere's willingness to criticize Bonn
-- and even his supporter, Helmut Kohl -- convinced Social
Democrats that the conservatives would fight for East German
interests. Some critics had argued that the conservatives
wouldn't dare contradict their Western patrons.
   The conservatives had not only pledged to work for quick
union with the West, they had also designated a West German
conservative, Elmar Pieroth, to play the key role of
negotiating the merger as economics minister. But in the wake
of the exchange-rate dispute, Mr. Pieroth was dropped to the
rank of economic adviser. The economics ministry will still
go to a conservative, East German Gerhard Pohl, who wants the
one-to-one currency swap to apply to up to 30,000 marks per
person. "An exchange amount of 2,000 marks is no good, it's
much too small," he told West German reporters.
   Meanwhile, Rainer Eppelmann, a peace activist and leader
of the conservative Democratic Awakening Party, is expected
to be East Germany's new defense minister. In this post, he
could significantly influence East-West negotiations over the
role of Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. To
underscore the obvious, the East Germans have even changed
the ministry's name -- to the Department of Defense and
Disarmament.

   Marketing:
   It's `Luxury'
   At $20,000
   For Infiniti

   NEW YORK -- Entry-level luxury? It may be a contradiction
in terms, but Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti division hopes the
concept will jump-start lagging sales in a way that Zen-like
image advertising simply hasn't done.
   Infiniti yesterday unveiled the new G20 sedan scheduled to
appear in dealer showrooms in mid-September and to be priced
"under $20,000," officials said. Meanwhile, Infiniti Monday
will begin showing its cars and their features in detail on
network television commercials for the first time.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new commercials will replace the rocks, trees and
pussy-willow buds that, officials now concede, dominated
their advertising for far too long. "We always said our No. 1
objective was to establish a brand, not to sell a model,"
said William Bruce, the head of Infiniti. But brand awareness
came more quickly than Infiniti expected, said Mr. Bruce,
which is why it's now time for Infiniti to emphasize the
less-esoteric task of selling cars.
   The new G20 model is a big part of that effort for
Infiniti, which has posted disappointing sales since its
launch last November. The so-called near-luxury niche is one
of the hottest segments in the market.
   Ford Motor Co. flopped in the segment and killed its
Merkur brand last year, but Infiniti's well-established
competition includes the Mercedes-Benz 190, Saab 900, Volvo
240DL, Honda Motor Co.'s Acura Integra and Audi of America,
with its 80 and 90 models. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, which
spent much of the past few years moving its models upscale,
is launching its own new near-luxury model, the 318is, with a
base price of $21,500.
   Besides those formidable opponents, the Infiniti G20 also
faces possible stiff competition from within Nissan itself,
specifically from the upscale Maxima sedan. The Maxima is
base-priced just above $20,000 and is marketed as a
"four-door sports car," which isn't terribly different from
the "sports luxury sedan" label that Infiniti has chosen for
the G20.
   "Will there be some cannibalization? Yes," conceded Mr.
Bruce at a news conference. "But will it be minimal?
Absolutely yes." The G20 and Maxima offer different features,
he explained. The G20 has a four-cylinder multivalve engine
and standard antilock brakes, while the Maxima has a
six-cylinder engine and offers antilock brakes as an
extra-cost option.
   The G20 went on sale in Japan in February as the Nissan
Primera. It will add to a growing Infiniti lineup that
already includes the Q45 luxury sedan, priced at about
$38,000, and the M30 coupe, priced at $23,500. In August,
Infiniti also will introduce a convertible version of the
M30. And another upscale model, priced perhaps in the $30,000
range, will be introduced in a couple of years.
   The goal, Mr. Bruce said, is to add enough models and
enough dealers -- for a total of about 150 instead of the
current 65 -- to sell about 100,000 Infiniti cars in the U.S.
each year by 1995. But Infiniti clearly has a long way to go.
   Infiniti sold only about 3,700 cars in the first quarter
of this year, while Toyota Motor Corp.'s rival Lexus division
sold 13,167 cars -- nearly four times as many. Lexus was
expected to outsell Infiniti by about 2-to-1 (based on a
higher production capacity and more dealers), but the current
sales gap has frustrated Nissan.
   The sales comparison with Lexus "is inevitable; we know
that and we accept that," Mr. Bruce said. But he tried to put
the best face on the situation by noting that Infiniti sold
more than 1,500 cars in March, compared with fewer than 1,100
in each of the previous two months. "The increase in
month-to-month sales," he said, "is dramatic."

   CHICAGO -- Abbott Laboratories was sued by a shareholder
who claims the maker of hospital products and pharmaceuticals
violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose
regulatory difficulties.
   The suit, filed in federal district court here, said
Abbott misled investors because its public statements didn't
indicate "that at least one of Abbott's manufacturing plants
was operating in serious violation of Food and Drug
Administration health and safety rules and regulations."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Federal inspectors late last year turned up
quality-control problems at Abbott's North Chicago
injectable-drug facility. The company -- which has
consistently maintained that the shortcomings were technical
in nature -- responded to the findings with a plan outlining
corrective measures, but FDA officials last month labeled the
plan insufficient. The FDA has suspended approval of new drug
applications involving drugs made at the injectable-drug
facility until the matter is resolved.
   As a result of Abbott's "misrepresentations and omissions"
involving the problems, the suit contends, the company's
stock price was artificially inflated. The suit seeks
class-action status on behalf of people who bought Abbott
stock from Feb. 21, 1989, to March 20, 1990, and asks for
unspecified damages.
   Abbott called the suit "groundless," saying the company
has "met all disclosure obligations."
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Abbott closed up 62.5 cents at $69.25, not far below the
52-week high of $70.375.

   Delays in Arrival of Goods
   For Spring May Worsen
   Chain's Financial Woes

   Some manufacturers have stopped shipping goods to Ames
Department Stores Inc. because of the discount department
store chain's financial problems.
   Shipments of hardware, clothing and other items --
seasonable goods needed to stock the retailer's shelves for
the spring -- have been put on hold at loading docks for the
past month by some vendors who still haven't been paid for
earlier shipments.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The delay in shipments could worsen the financial
difficulties of Ames, which earlier this week said it expects
to report a $228 million loss for its fiscal year ended Jan.
27 and plans to close 74 of its 680 stores. The loss stems
largely from Ames's inability so far to turn around the
troubled former Zayre department stores that it acquired in
1988.
   A lack of deliveries from vendors helped push two Campeau
Corp. subsidiaries -- Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp. -- into filing for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code
earlier this year. "Ames is Campeau in the making," said
Steve Herman, a Boston retail consultant.
   In addition to waiting for payments on past deliveries,
Ames vendors said they are holding up shipments pending
further word on whether Ames can successfully negotiate a new
credit agreement with its banks and get a capital infusion
that it is seeking.
   "The clock is ticking for Ames," said Alan Millstein,
publisher of a fashion network report in New York. "Spring
sales are big for any retailer. In the next few months
back-to-school stuff should start shipping. These are
critical moments in the cycle. If back-to-school doesn't
ship, they're dead."
   Gerber Childrenswear Inc., a unit of Gerber Products Co.,
said it won't ship $1 million of spring wear ordered by Ames
until it is paid some of the $1.2 million owed by Ames for
winter clothing, some of it shipped in November, a member of
Gerber management said. "We've written letters. . . . We sent
the company faxes. We've called Ames every day for the last
three months. No response," the manager said. "We're not the
only {vendors}. An army of people out there who service Ames
are angry."
   PepsiCo Inc. said it isn't making soft drink deliveries to
Ames unless it is paid in cash. "We don't like to do this as
a rule, {but} just with companies that can't pay, like Ames,"
a company manager said.
   Also, at least one factoring agency, which buys
manufacturers' receivables and assumes the risk that the
bills will be paid, has advised a number of apparel makers
not to ship until a clearer financial picture emerges. "The
ball's in Ames's court," said the credit manager of the New
York agency.
   Meanwhile, many merchants are getting nervous. "In the
last two days I've had a number of vendors call me asking,
`Should I ship, should I ship?' " said Wayne Hood, a retail
analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities.
   Ames didn't return calls seeking comment. The company's
stock, which has dropped sharply in recent days, closed
yesterday at $2.50, up 12.5 cents on very heavy volume of
about 2.3 millions shares in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
   The blocked shipments have placed the Rocky Hill, Conn.,
company in "a precarious Catch-22 position that no company
ever wants to be in," said Howard Davidowitz, a retailing and
financial consultant in New York. "The vendors want to know
what the banks are going to do and the banks want to know if
the vendors are going to ship. It's panic time." He added,
"They desperately need someone to take a stake in the company
and help rebuild their balance sheet."
   In addition to seeking a capital infusion, Ames hopes to
ease its cash pinch by closing stores and selling their
inventory. It currently is negotiating a sale of goods in the
74 stores it is closing to Jerome Schottenstein, a Columbus,
Ohio, merchandise liquidator. Mr. Schottenstein declined
comment, citing the negotiations. It's believed that
inventory sale could provide Ames with $75 million to $100
million in cash.
   Ames received about $75 million in a similar sale of goods
to Mr. Schottenstein last year when the company closed 74
Zayre stores, estimated Edward Comeau, an analyst for
Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Mr. Comeau, however, added that the closing of 74 stores
"may not be significant enough. I've advised all our people
to get out of the stock. . . . We felt another 100 to 200
stores ought to be closed" to resolve Ames's problems.
   By Mr. Comeau's calculation, Ames had used up
approximately $300 million of its $475 million revolving
credit as of last month. And that was before the April 10
deadline for most retailers in the industry to pay their
largest vendors. Along with interest payments on bank debt,
Ames runs the risk of running out of credit unless it can
renegotiate its lending agreement, analysts suggested.

   Southland Corp. Paints Bleak Outlook
   Even if Firm Completes Restructuring

   DALLAS -- Southland Corp. said it expects to report losses
through 1992 and negative cash flow through 1993 even if it
is successful in restructuring $1.8 billion in publicly
traded debt.
   The owner and operator of 7-Eleven stores, which has
agreed to sell control of the company to Japanese investors
upon completion of the proposed debt swap, said in a
preliminary prospectus of the plan that it doesn't expect to
report a profit until 1993. Moreover, the company said it
expects cash flow to be, at best, break-even, between 1991
and 1997. Cash flow this year, however, is expected to be
positive, largely because of proceeds from the sale of its
50% stake in Citgo Petroleum Corp. in January.

   Southland said the projections assume that it completes
the debt restructuring, cutting its cash interest payments by
$1.6 billion between now and 1998, and that it increases its
capital spending and advertising efforts to improve its
competitive position.
   Despite the bleak projections, the company is expected to
have a difficult time selling its exchange offer to
bondholders. Southland is proposing swapping its bonds
outstanding, most of which currently pay cash interest and
mature between 1995 and 2002, for stock and zero-coupon bonds
that don't pay cash interest and mature between 1998 and
2003. The swap is part of a plan to recapitalize the
debt-heavy company by selling 75% of the stock to the owners
of its Japanese "Sebun-Irebun" stores for $400 million.
   Although the preliminary prospectus only became available
yesterday, a bondholders' group already has organized to
fight the plan, saying that the company should pay them cash
interest or otherwise sweeten the offer. In particular, the
group is angry that the Thompson family, which currently owns
most of Southland's stock, would retain about 15% of the
equity in the restructured company. Bondholders would own the
remaining 10%.
   In the prospectus, Southland blamed increasing competition
in the convenience store business for its failure to meet
projections made when it went private in a $4.9 billion
leveraged buy-out in 1987. The company said it has had to
sell more assets than it planned to meet its cash needs and
said it believes it will run into liquidity problems this
year. It also reiterated its belief that it will have to seek
bankruptcy-law protection if its financial restructuring
isn't completed.
   Southland said that to meet its amortization and
debt-service requirements between 1991 and 1997, its
operating earnings need to grow at an average of at least 22%
a year. However, over the last two years, its operating
earnings grew at an annual rate of 10%, and they are
projected to decline 24% in 1990.
   The company said that if the debt swap is completed, it
expects to spend its cash savings on improving existing
stores, taxes from the sale of its Citgo stake and an
aggressive store-opening program. Company projections show
that Southland hopes to open 134 new stores in 1991, 152 in
1992 and 230 in 1993, compared with just 52 this year. After
selling or closing 324 stores this year, the company says it
plans to sell or close 200 stores a year through 1997.
   Southland also said it expects to improve its merchandise
gross margins to 35% to 36% from 34.7% in 1989.

   Finding Charity Just Too Taxing,
   They Make Some Nice Donations

   Where can you get something for nothing in New York? With
April 15 around the corner, the answer seems to be lying in
the streets.
   Since the Tax Reform Act of 1986, donating personal
property to charity doesn't seem to pay anymore. With that in
mind, more upper-crust residents are forgoing deductions and
simply putting their discards out on the street.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "If you donate a $500 table, for example, you have to
indicate when you bought it, how much you paid, and the fair
market value," says Stanley Person, senior partner in Person
&amp; Co., an accounting firm. All that hassle "puts people off."
Moreover, Stephen Seltzer, another CPA, says today the
effective rate for tax savings on personal property
deductions for a New York City resident is only 37%, compared
with 60% before 1986. In other words, the incentive is gone.
   To the delight of tasteful scavengers. Ruth Manning,
president of a personnel company and a hunter of terrific
trash in her fashionable Upper East Side neighborhood,
observes that "New Yorkers are more capricious about the way
they dispose of goods; they're not as concerned with giving
to charity anymore because it's not as much to their
benefit." Ms. Manning says she has amassed chairs, tables,
lamps and an antique bird cage, thanks to her "good eye" and
her habit of early-morning jogging.
   Sometimes the best stuff doesn't even make it to the curb.
A Park Avenue resident, an art dealer who declines to be
named, describes the "private enterprise" of a small cartel
of building superintendents. "When someone dies in these posh
buildings," he says, "the heirs want to get rid of things
fast" without cumbersome paper work required for donations.
The supers take it off their hands -- and promptly sell it to
neighbors in the know.
   Jonathan Roskes, an international bank examiner with the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, praises the pickings in his
Upper West Side neighborhood, partly because he puts out his
own things. After all, he reasons, it's easier placing them
on the street "than selling them, packing and labeling them,
or arranging garage sales."
   He cautions that some finds are better left behind. The
Columbia graduate claims classmates of his got more than they
bargained for with a found rug. "They lugged the carpet back
to our dorm, unrolled it, and discovered a dead body inside."

   Many of the intellectuals in the West who remain attracted
to socialism should consider the views of voters who have
lived under such regimes. Those voices could be heard this
past weekend in places as diverse as Greece, Peru, Hungary
and the Yugoslav republic of Slovenia.
   In Greece, Constantine Mitsotakis's Conservative Party has
ended the decade-old stranglehold on Greece by Andreas
Papandreou and his socialist PASOK party. Greece now has a
ruined economy, an annual inflation rate approaching 18%,
poisoned relations with NATO allies and growing urban
terrorism. Mr. Mitsotakis's pledge to curb government
spending and create a business climate that will attract
foreign investment appealed to voters, as did his explicit
commitment to retain U.S. military bases in Greece.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Greece's problems appear small alongside Peru's, whose
hyperinflation was last clocked in excess of 2,000%.
Left-wing guerrilla violence has taken a toll of 17,000 lives
over the past decade. Voters in Sunday's presidential
election defied the Shining Path bombs, and opted for two
free-marketers, novelist Mario Vargas Llosa and
Japanese-Peruvian Alberto Fujimori. Privatization, tax reform
and slashed government spending were planks in the Vargas
Llosa platform. But Mr. Fujimori adroitly exploited some poor
economic advice Mr. Vargas Llosa followed.
   Mr. Vargas Llosa's call for a Brazilian-style austerity
program ignored the supply-side lessons of the 1980s. In a
country where one out of three persons lives hand-to-mouth,
belt-tightening sounds cruelly absurd. The approach of the
agronomist Mr. Fujimori, emphasizing a business climate
hospitable to foreign investment, makes him a formidable
candidate for the June runoff election.
   In Hungary practically nothing remains of the left after
the second round of parliamentary elections. Historian Jozsef
Antall's center-right Democratic Forum with its alliance took
57% of the vote. The rival Free Democrats and Young Democrats
made a political miscalculation by adopting a center-left
label, though their platforms have been more aggressively
free market than those of the conservatives. Parties in
Romania, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria preparing for elections
may want to keep in mind the peril of even the most subtle
hint of statist leanings.
   Slovenia also fits the trend. Voters gave the Communist
Party the backs of their hands in the races for the
republic's parliament, holding the Communist share to 17%,
against 56% for the opposition coalition. This election is
another sign that Yugoslavia's uneasy federation of
ethnically distinct states is beginning to come apart.
   Defeat at the polls seldom is accepted gracefully by the
left, whose ideology tends to be streaked with messianic
confidence. The indicted Mr. Papandreou is making threatening
noises. The Shining Path still threatens to blow apart,
literally, Peruvian democracy. Hungarians are not sure
they've escaped the grip of Communist Russia. Belgrade has
filed criminal charges against Yugoslav opposition leader
Joze Pucnik for "insulting" the army in the campaign.
   But now that voters in all these places have had a say,
maybe at least the world's socialists who operate from
countries free of socialism's depredations will pause for
reflection.

   Anti-AIDS Hybrid
   Made by Genentech
   Clears 2 Hurdles

   A hybrid antibody against acquired immune deficiency
syndrome created by Genentech Inc. has jumped two important
biological hurdles, scientists said.
   The experimental agent succeeded in rallying natural
immunity against the AIDS infection and in reaching the
fetuses of pregnant primates, suggesting a possible approach
for the prevention of AIDS in newborns.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The findings were reported in the British journal Nature
by Daniel J. Capon, a scientist at Genenetch, a biotechnology
concern based in South San Francisco, Calif., and Randal A.
Byrn, a researcher at New England Deaconess Hospital in
Boston.
   Genentech emphasized that although formal proof of the
biological properties of the experimental therapy, called
CD4-IgG, is encouraging, it doesn't take the place of
clinical trials in AIDS patients, which began last August and
are continuing at several centers nationwide.
   CD4-IgG fuses the human antibody immunoglobulin G to a
copy of the target molecule CD4, which is used by the virus
to infect human cells. This approach lengthens the half-life,
or prolongs its activity in the body, as well as several
other advantages that previously were considered theoretical.
   The researchers also wondered whether this approach could
help rally the body's active immunity against the virus, or
cross the placenta of females to their fetuses. In fact, it
did both, the report says.
   The scientists said CD4-IgG directed certain cells of the
immune system, called "killer cells," to attack and destroy
AIDS-infected cells in the body. The agent spares uninfected
"bystander cells," as researchers had hoped.
   In addition, tests with pregnant rhesus monkeys
demonstrated that CD4-IgG is transported through the placenta
from mother to fetus, in much the same way that natural
immunoglobulin is passed from a woman to her fetus.
   Given the problem of growing numbers of pediatric AIDS
patients infected by their mothers before or during birth,
the finding gives hope that CD4-IgG might lead to a strategy
for prenatal AIDS treatment, the report says.

   Aflatoxin-Tainted Corn Found in Iowa
   ---
   Case Shows Difficulties
   Of Guarding Against Poison

   A mountain of moldy yellow corn rises from a concrete slab
outside the small farm town of Lowden, Iowa. The grain --
12,755 bushels of it -- is under quarantine because it
contains unusually high amounts of deadly aflatoxin.
   The corn is so poisonous that safety officials must don
air masks when they approach it. But though safely guarded
now, the situation wasn't so under control a few weeks ago
when the corn, officials say, might have made it into the
nation's food chain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We were very lucky. Very, very lucky," says W. Michael
Rogers, the federal Food and Drug Administration's district
director in Kansas City, Mo.
   The culprit was another government agency -- the Farmers
Home Administration -- which peddled the poison corn to a
Lowden grain elevator for $9,600. Had the corn gotten into
the food supply, the consequences could have been deadly. One
batch tested from the Lowden stockpile was found to contain
1,600 times the amount considered dangerous for human
consumption.
   The fact that the tainted corn got anywhere near Harlan
Pruess's grain business in Lowden illuminates how difficult
it remains for regulators to police for grain contaminated
with aflatoxin: a naturally occurring carcinogen that broke
out in the Midwest corn crop two years ago.
   Aflatoxin is a poison that can be fatal. Researchers also
have linked chronic low-level exposure of aflatoxin to liver
cancer in humans in regions of Asia and Africa. The poison,
which is excreted by a fungus under certain temperature and
moisture conditions, can also taint peanuts and other crops.
   Iowa officials are furious that the Farmers Home
Administration didn't destroy the crop. "I'm very upset. The
Farmers Home Administration put the public health at risk,"
says Dale M. Cochran, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture.
   Rodney E. Leonard, executive director of the Community
Nutrition Institute, a Washington-based food safety advocacy
group, calls the chain of events "unbelievable." He says that
livestock that ate such highly contaminated corn would sicken
or die and that the milk of dairy cattle would also be
contaminated.
   Even though unsafe levels of aflatoxin were discovered in
milled corn and milk after the 1988 outbreak, the government
doesn't require mandatory inspection of corn before
processing -- something that is required of the peanut
industry. So far, the Bush administration has only proposed
mandatory screening of corn bound for the lucrative export
market. Aflatoxin became a hot trade issue after several
nations said they had found the poison in U.S. corn or
corn-derived products.
   Details of the Lowden transaction are sketchy. Mr. Pruess,
the Lowden grain dealer, wouldn't comment on how he came to
acquire the contaminated shipment. An FmHA spokeswoman said
the agency believes it didn't do anything wrong. "We followed
our guidelines" in handling the corn, she said.
   According to several state and federal officials familiar
with the case, however, FmHA officials in Pryor, Okla., took
possession of the corn this winter from at least one farmer
that had filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws.
   The FmHA officials handling the corn apparently were told
it was contaminated. The bill of sale includes a notice that
the crop contained at least 5,000 parts of aflatoxin per
billion. The FDA considers it unsafe for humans to consume
corn that contains more than 20 parts per billion of
aflatoxin. Corn containing more than 300 parts of aflatoxin
per billion is considered dangerous to feed to livestock.
   Since the grain has been stored in Lowden, one sample test
found aflatoxin levels at an astounding 32,000 parts per
billion. And levels are probably rising. "I'm afraid it is
going nuclear on us," says Daryl Frey, director of Iowa's
state agriculture laboratory.
   One of the most puzzling aspects of this transaction is
that the FDA knew the FmHA was sitting on a pile of
contaminated corn and didn't stop it from leaving Oklahoma.
The FDA's Mr. Rogers says that the FmHA was told that the
corn should be destroyed. However, the FmHA spokeswoman said
she "has no evidence" of any warning.
   The FDA restricts interstate shipment of corn that is
contaminated with even a minuscule amount of aflatoxin if it
is intended for human or animal consumption.
   In early March, the FDA quickly tracked down the corn
after a concerned dairy farmer tipped off Oklahoma
agriculture officials that the corn was going to be moved.
The FDA notified Iowa officials, who arrived in Lowden as the
corn was being unloaded from trucks.
   Iowa officials said they feared that Mr. Pruess would
attempt to blend the contaminated corn with uncontaminated
corn to reach legal levels for livestock feed. While such
blending isn't illegal if approved by regulators, accurately
blending such highly contaminated corn would have been
exceptionally difficult, state officials said. Mr. Pruess
declined to comment on what he intended to do with the
contaminated corn.
   The Lowden case has sent a chill through grain experts who
have worried about the practice of using damaged corn in
livestock feed. The level of aflatoxin is much higher than
has ever been detected in U.S. corn and the case raises
questions about whether other grain dealers are acquiring
extremely contaminated grain.
   "This example luckily was caught," said Charles R.
Hurburgh, an Iowa State University grain-quality expert. "Are
there others?"

   Your Money Matters:
   Credit Card Giants Grow;
   Lower Rates Not in Sight

   The big players in the credit card business are
consolidating their grip on the $147.7 billion market -- and
that's bad news for cardholders hoping for lower interest
rates.
   In the 13 months through January, at least $9.4 billion of
bank card loans -- representing about 7% of the Visa and
MasterCard business -- changed hands through acquisitions,
according to First Chicago Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Industry officials say the pace of acquisitions is
expected to quicken, as Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp.,
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., First Chicago, BankAmerica Corp. and
the other top card issuers take over more and more of the
business.
   Just last month, First City Bancorp. of Texas sold its
$545 million bank-card portfolio to Bank of New York. The
reason: It was too small to compete effectively, a spokesman
says.
   As the credit card wars continue to heat up, consumers can
expect to be enticed with bigger credit lines, special
services and a barrage of advertising. But don't expect lower
interest rates.
   With fewer and bigger players, the dominant issuers face
less competitive pressure to cut their charges. That's
especially true since consumers generally tend to pick card
issuers on the basis of such factors as convenience and size
of credit ceiling, not interest rates. In fact, surveys show
that while at least half the people with credit cards use
them to borrow money, few people accept the cards intending
to do so.
   Moreover, at a time of growing problems with real estate
and other loans, card issuers have a strong incentive not to
lower their rates: Credit card profit margins are the highest
in the banking business, despite loan losses that in some
cases are as high as 5% of loans outstanding. Pretax profits
for the biggest issuers are huge -- running between 3% and 5%
of total loans. That means pretax credit card profits at
Citicorp, by far the largest issuer, could soon reach $1
billion annually.
   Some issuers still offer better deals than others, and
cardholders who maintain an account or some other banking
relationship sometimes get preferential treatment. But almost
all of the largest issuers charge a standard 19.8% rate, with
a $20 annual fee. And issuers show no signs of willingness to
cut the fees.
   Asked if First Chicago plans to compete by lowering rates,
Scott Marks, an executive vice president, replied: "I think
not."
   The prospect of little or no relief on rates gives
cardholders added incentive to pay off their balances. That's
especially true now that only 10% of the interest on credit
card bills is tax-deductible. Beginning next year, none of it
will be deductible.
   People who don't have the resources to pay off all of
their credit card debt might want to consider reducing their
monthly payments by switching to a home equity loan.
Currently, the rate on a typical home equity loan, with an
interest rate of two percentage points over the banks' prime
rate, is just 12%. Moreover, interest payments on home equity
loans of as much as $100,000 are generally tax-deductible.
   Borrowers should remember, however, that home equity loans
are secured by their home. Although they can be useful for
consolidating other debt, and sometimes for buying a car or
financing an investment, it isn't a good idea to borrow
against your home for things like a night on the town or a
new spring outfit.
   High interest rates have been a sore point for years with
credit card users and critics such as Rep. Charles E.
Schumer, a New York Democrat. As recently as two years ago,
he threatened to propose a national cap on credit card rates.
But he held off, hoping that a law forcing uniform and more
prominent disclosure of rates and fees would spur price
competition by making consumers more aware of the costs of
borrowing by plastic.
   That hasn't happened, however, and now Mr. Schumer says
he'll wait before trying to legislate lower rates. "The only
way it's going to happen is if one company with national
advertising power breaks out of the mold -- instead of
everybody winking at each other," he says. "Unfortunately,
{the uniformity of rates} isn't a violation of the law."
   Instead of competing on rates, credit card issuers are
offering bigger credit limits, touting features such as
replacement insurance for merchandise bought by plastic and
using extensive advertising to make their cards appear more
appealing than that of their competitors.
   James L. Bailey, who runs Citicorp's huge credit card
business, notes that switching to a different credit card
issuer is often as easy as mailing back a postage-paid,
direct-mail solicitation. Switching checking accounts, on the
other hand, usually involves a wait in line at two separate
banks.

   Market Rises as Technology Stocks Gain;
   Apple Computer, Microsoft Are Higher

   Technology stocks led a slight gain in the
over-the-counter market as investors selectively dipped their
toes into quiet, pre-holiday trading.
   "The tech stocks are still hanging in there" after
Tuesday's strength, said Bob McCready, an institutional
trader with St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index closed up 1.63 at 433.53 for a
0.37% gain. Thus, it outstripped the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which slipped 1.35 to close at 2729.73, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index, down 1.98 to
close at 357.54. Advancing OTC stocks beat decliners, 956 to
906, as volume rose to 133,820,400 shares from 129,504,900.
   Leading the technology stocks, Apple Computer added 1 1/4
to 42 1/2. Apple's chairman and chief executive officer John
Sculley gave a keynote address yesterday at a trade show in
San Francisco that focused on the company's Macintosh
personal computer hardware and software products. The company
is expected to report third-quarter earnings next week.
   Microsoft, which yesterday introduced a software product
to help programmers boost productivity, rose 3 to 121. Intel,
which is expected to report first-quarter results today,
gained 1/4 to close at 42 3/4.
   Investors tended to pick their shares carefully, said
William R. Rothe, managing director for OTC trading for Alex.
Brown &amp; Sons in Baltimore. Most investors flush with cash are
content to "just sit back and rifle shoot and take
opportunities when they see them," investing in bargains and
selling on bad news, Mr. Rothe said.
   Jerry Mullins, head of OTC trading at Dean Witter
Reynolds, saw retail buying outpace institutional buying at
that brokerage as investors favored the buy side. But by the
end of the day, E.E. "Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog
Heine Geduld Inc., said he saw institutional buying "leaning
toward the sell side."
   Mr. McCready of A.G. Edwards predicts today's market will
drift until the last hour of trading, when he suggests the
market may bounce up as traders who sold shares short rush to
cover their positions in advance of the three-day Easter
weekend. Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, betting
on a decline that will allow them to return the borrowed
shares later at a profit.
   MCI Communications closed off 3/8 at 36 1/8 after it was
reported that chairman and chief executive William McGowan
underwent exploratory chest surgery.
   Disappointing earnings pressured shares of Vivigen Inc.,
off 2 at 19, and Home Savings &amp; Loan, which fell 1 to close
at 15 1/2.
   Vivigen, a genetic testing laboratory based in Santa Fe,
N.M., reported first quarter net income of 11 cents a share
versus 15 cents in the year-ago quarter.
   Comshare fell 2 1/4 to 36 1/4. The company said a lowered
earnings forecast by a Chicago Corp. analyst was largely
responsible for the drop. The analyst slashed a fiscal
third-quarter earnings estimate for the company to about 40
cents a share from a previous estimate of 60 cents, according
to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.
   Amid positive earnings stories, Caere added 2 to 24 1/4
after reporting first-quarter net income of 25 cents a share,
up from 10 cents a year earlier.
   Among bank stocks rising yesterday, University National
Bank gained 4 to 32, Midlantic rose 5/8 to 16 1/2, BayBanks
added 3/4 to close at 16 3/4, Northeast Bancorp added 1/2 to
32 1/2, and Society for Savings gained 5/8 to 12 1/4.
   Laserscope slipped 7/8 to 15 3/8. Alex. Brown &amp; Sons said
this activity was related to the partial expiration of a
lock-up agreement between the company and some major
investors that restricted those investors from selling shares
following Laserscope's November 1989 initial public offering.

   To Thwart BTR Offer

   BOSTON -- A federal court judge here dealt a major setback
to Norton Co. in its effort to fend off BTR PLC's $1.64
billion hostile bid, ordering Norton to hold its annual
meeting as scheduled April 26.
   Norton immediately appealed the decision, saying in an
affidavit that it "will have no choice but to put Norton up
for sale" if the meeting isn't delayed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   London-based BTR is expected to proceed with a proxy fight
to unseat Norton's board. Norton, a Worcester, Mass.-based
chemicals and abrasives maker, had canceled its annual
meeting and scheduled a special shareholders meeting June 26,
citing the need for time to pursue other options such as a
"white squire" minority partner.
   The ruling is a major blow to Norton because the company
itself conceded in a hearing last week that it was unlikely
to prevail in a proxy fight if the annual meeting were held
as scheduled.
   In an interview in London, John Cahill, BTR chief
executive officer, said BTR "absolutely" will go ahead with
its proxy fight in light of the court decision. He added that
initial indications showed that "between 50% and 70%" of
Norton holders had tendered their shares to BTR under the
offer that began last month. Speaking of the court decision,
Mr. Cahill said: "We are very pleased about the result. It
changes the ballgame."
   Holding the meeting April 26 will force shareholders to
vote "before the board has had a reasonable opportunity to
explore alternatives," said John M. Nelson, chairman and
chief executive officer.
   BTR, which launched its $75-a-share cash bid March 15,
said that shareholders "now will have a timely opportunity to
take steps to have Norton Co. remove the obstacles" to its
tender offer.
   In his ruling, U.S. District Judge Joseph Tauro cited
Norton's own bylaws that prohibit changing the date of an
annual meeting within 60 days of its scheduled date. The case
"clearly tips in (BTR's) favor because its legitimate
interest in enforcing Norton's bylaws -- a contract made for
the shareholders' benefit -- must trump the (Norton) board's
interest in circumscribing them."
   Norton has insisted that BTR's offer is inadequate, but
analysts are skeptical that Norton can come up with a
recapitalization or other alternative worth enough to top the
BTR bid. They think Norton could get only $65 to $70 even by
loading the company up with debt. "I don't see what basic
defense they could have against the fact that $75 is a lot
more than the stock has ever sold for," said David Sutliff of
S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. "I can't conceive of an alternative the
company could put in place to get that kind of return to
shareholders."
   One Wall Street source said Norton will try to have its
appeal heard as early as next Tuesday. Takeover stock traders
and Wall Street people said that if the April 26 date is
upheld, it's likely to force Norton to try to find a white
knight or negotiate a friendly deal with BTR.
   Traders said an April 26 meeting would eliminate a
possible Norton defense of selling a block of stock to a
friendly holder, or employee stock ownership plan, that could
block a takeover. Because only Norton shareholders as of
March 2 may vote at an April 26 meeting, new friendly
investors couldn't vote to block the purchase.
   Traders said yesterday's $3.125 jump in the stock price,
to $76 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, reflected the betting that a friendly transaction
would be negotiated in the range of $78 to $80 a share. BTR
has said it would be willing to pay more if Norton would open
its books and show that the value is there.
   Norton has painted BTR as a heartless foreign raider and
rallied state legislators to its cause. A bill now before the
state Senate would make it more time consuming to prevail in
a proxy fight against Massachusetts-based companies. The bill
would require all companies in the state to have staggered
directors' terms, unless the board votes otherwise. Under the
proposed law, installing a new slate of directors through a
proxy fight would take at least a year or more.
   But traders and Wall Street sources don't believe the
Massachusetts law can be passed until April 21 or later,
which might be too late for Norton. One Wall Street source
said Norton's directors probably couldn't prudently wait
until the last minute before seeking white-knight buyers, a
step that could effectively put the company up for sale.
   A Senate aide said the bill had been returned to committee
this week for amendment after opponents raised constitutional
questions about the measure. "We were hoping to see the bill
out by early next week, and assuming we can overcome the
technical objections, we still hope to see fast action on the
bill," the staff member said.
   Separately, Norton said it completed the $550 million sale
of its Eastman Christensen Co. to Baker Hughes Inc. Under the
agreement, in addition to the cash payment, Baker is to
assume $8 million in debt and issue a five-year warrant to
Norton to purchase as many as eight million shares of Baker's
common at $36.75 a share.

   Economy:
   Saudi Arabia Discovers More Oil in Field
   That May Prove to Rival World's Biggest
   ----

   Saudi Arabia made another discovery of high-quality crude
oil, strengthening its role as the world's largest exporter
of petroleum.
   In a statement released in the Saudi capital of Riyadh and
in Washington, the kingdom's Petroleum Ministry announced the
new exploratory well was tested at a rate of 2,800 barrels a
day. Though not huge by Middle East standards, the flow is
respectable and marks a new find for the area southeast of
Riyadh. Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, called it a new
field.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the well has significance beyond that. For one thing,
in recent interviews, Saudi oil officials have indicated that
they are looking into the possibility that several recent
discoveries in that same region eventually may prove to be
one giant field. If so, such a field could rival in size the
Saudi's Ghawar field, the world's largest.
   Whether that's the case or not, these finds, which are
well away from the original Aramco concessions in the main
oil province of eastern Saudi Arabia, are important because
they are turning up light, low-sulfur crudes that are
relatively scarce in the Middle East. These so-called "sweet"
crudes are much in demand because they yield more of
preferred fuels such as gasoline and also because they
pollute less than the higher-sulfur grades such as Arab
Heavy.
   Much of the current world oil glut is due to a growing
surplus of so-called "sour" crudes, those that have a high
sulfur content and generally are more dense. As a result,
there has been a widening spread between the prices that
refiners will pay for the sweet and sour crudes. Sellers are
discounting sour crudes as much as $4 or $5 a barrel below
the prices of sweet crudes.
   This has meant a stepped-up search by members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, particularly
those in the Middle East, for more of the higher-quality
types of oil. And Saudi Arabian Oil Co. -- or Saudi Aramco,
the national oil company -- has made recent strikes of
high-quality crudes in the Dilam, Al-Hawtah and Raghib
regions.
   All these are south to southeast of Riyadh and in the same
general vicinity. The latest find lies east of Al-Hawtah.
   The new discovery well, the Naeem-1, produced oil and
natural gas from a depth of between 8,843 and 8,965 feet. The
Saudis reported that production was through a half-inch
opening and that the well also produced 600,000 cubic feet of
gas a day.
   According to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, the
crude oil had a gravity of 42.4 degrees API. This is a
commonly used American Petroleum Institute measurement of
density; the higher the gravity, the lighter the crude. Arab
Berri, the highest-quality Saudi crude, currently produced in
relatively minimal quantities, has a gravity of 39 degrees.
   Saudi Arabia has a pressing need to increase oil revenue,
but is constrained in the amount of oil it can produce
because of its OPEC quota. However, Saudi officials have
noted that they could get premium prices for any sweet crudes
they could find and export. One estimate by the Petroleum
Ministry is that the higher-quality crudes could raise Saudi
Arabia's oil revenue an average of between $1 and $2 a
barrel.

   LOS ANGELES -- Teledyne Inc. posted a 17% drop in
first-quarter net income to $58.3 million, or $1.05 a share,
from $70.5 million, or $1.26 a share, a year ago.
   Per-share amounts reflected a 5-for-1 common stock split
distributed March 1. Sales fell 3.2% to $836.9 million from
$864.3 million a year earlier. The manufacturing and
insurance concern said sales dropped in all segments except
its aviation and electronics businesses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company also for the first time broke out results for
its insurance and finance operations that are being spun off
into a new company called Unitrin Inc. Total revenue of the
Unitrin companies increased to $298.6 million from $272.1
million a year ago. Profit from those businesses, classified
as discontinued operations, fell to $25.6 million, or 46
cents a share, from $35.3 million, or 63 cents a share, a
year earlier. Per-share amounts were calculated using 55.4
million average Unitrin shares. Teledyne said it expects to
mail the Unitrin stock certificates to its shareholders this
month.
   Teledyne said the casualty insurance companies experienced
a drop in underwriting results in the latest quarter,
primarily because of "adverse experience from storms and in
personal lines."
   Profit from continuing operations fell to $32.7 million,
or 59 cents a share, from $35.2 million, or 63 cents a share,
a year ago. Included in the results for the latest quarter
was a reversal of a $7.7 million provision for income taxes
recorded in prior years on undistributed earnings of the
insurance and finance subsidiaries.
   Earnings were released after the close of stock market
trading yesterday. In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Teledyne shares closed at $71.125, off 25 cents.

   The UAL Corp. board cut the fees and expenses United
Airlines union advisers would receive in connection with the
unions' proposed $4.38 billion purchase of UAL, according to
documents released yesterday.
   The unions' advisers had been criticized for sharing in
fees totaling $58.7 million for their work on an earlier
labor-management buy-out that collapsed for lack of
financing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under a new, $4 billion offer March 19 negotiated with
Coniston Partners, UAL's largest shareholder, the union
advisers would have received $65 million if they were outbid,
and $25 million even if they couldn't obtain financing a
second time.
   In negotiating a new merger agreement after the unions
sweetened their bid last week, the board got the unions to
reduce those amounts to $40 million for being outbid and $20
million if they can't obtain financing.

   In First Quarter;
   Outlook Uncertain

   NEW YORK -- CBS Inc. posted a 52% increase in
first-quarter net income, boosted by the January telecast of
the Super Bowl. But CBS warned of an "uncertain" outlook for
the second half of this year amid a sluggish economy and
rising costs for sports contracts.
   CBS, the third-place network in prime time, has bet $3.6
billion over several years for big-time sports events in the
hope of sparking a ratings turnaround. The first two big
payments on that gamble come due later this year, the first
year of CBS's four-year contracts for major league baseball
and professional football, priced at $1.06 billion for each
four-year package.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the first quarter, when neither sports package had yet
kicked in, CBS earned $85.3 million or $3.31 a share, up from
$56.1 million or $2.18 a share a year ago. Revenue rose 16%
to $851 million from $730.6 million.
   The earnings far exceeded the consensus estimates of Wall
Street analysts, who had expected CBS to earn about $2.70 a
share instead of the $3.31 the company turned in. CBS stock
rose $2 a share immediately following the company's earnings
report, then fell back a bit to close at $180.125, up 62.5
cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   CBS didn't break out results for the CBS network. A
spokesman said, however, that the network would have posted
higher earnings even without the help of football's Super
Bowl. Analyst Raymond Katz of Mabon, Nugent &amp; Co. estimates
the Super Bowl added $20 million in pretax profit to the
network's results.
   The company's broadcast group, which includes the network,
TV stations and radio stations and is CBS's only major
subsidiary, logged a strong 89% gain in pretax operating
profit in the quarter. CBS also was aided by continuing
interest income on its $2.9 billion in cash and marketable
securities, gaining $41.7 million compared with $39.4 million
a year ago.
   But how CBS fares later in the year is another matter. Mr.
Katz of Mabon Nugent said the first-quarter surge "isn't
indicative of a bullish year." He had predicted full-year
earnings of $12.50 a share (vs. $11.51 last year) but now
plans to reduce the forecast. By the fourth quarter, unless
the World Series features teams in large TV markets and runs
for more than four or five games, "they're going to get
hurt," he said.
   Peter P. Appert of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. is
more upbeat, predicting that CBS will earn $13 a share this
year. He sees strong ad sales in the second half, despite
worries to the contrary expressed by CBS President Laurence
A. Tisch, and says robust sales can "hide a lot of cost
problems."

   AUSTIN -- Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards won a
decisive victory over Attorney General Jim Mattox in a
Democratic gubernatorial primary that sets up a Texas-sized
brawl with Republican Clayton Williams in the fall.
   Mrs. Richards, a recovered alcoholic, rode out a storm of
criticism from the pugnacious Mr. Mattox, who repeatedly
called on her to say if she had ever used illegal drugs. She
tried to deflect the question by charging that Mr. Mattox had
profited from his years in public service, and she called on
him to release his federal income-tax returns. It was, by any
standard, one of the nastiest campaigns in Texas political
history.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mrs. Richards won more than 600,000 votes, or 57%, while
Mr. Mattox picked up more than 460,000 votes, or 43%.
   Mr. Mattox said Mrs. Richards "has proven that she's a
very strong candidate" and pledged to help her in an uphill
campaign against the GOP's Mr. Williams, a banker, oil man
and rancher who spent $8 million, $6 million of it from his
own deep pockets, to win his party's nomination.

   Nutri/System Inc., a marketer of weight loss programs, is
having trouble getting network approval for new TV
commercials designed to bolster its badly damaged image.
   The proposed ads, which strongly assert the safety of the
Nutri/System program, were prepared after the company was hit
last month with several lawsuits from women alleging the
Nutri/System program caused severe gallbladder problems.

   Nutri/System declined to comment on the new ads. But
network executives say they are concerned that some health
and safety claims in the proposed ads may be unsubstantiated.
   Some of the controversial spots include assurances that
Nutri/System's primary concern is its customers' health.
Others assert that independent doctors recommend the program
or that weight lost under the diet plan is gone for good.
Network executives also said they are concerned that the ads
don't clearly advise potential customers to consult a
physician before joining up.
   So far, none of the major networks has agreed to run the
new spots. Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and CBS Inc. have asked
Nutri/System to back up its claims. NBC, a General Electric
Co. unit, is also awaiting further information before making
a final decision. "We've seen new scripts, and some we've
seen have problems," says Rick Gitter, an NBC advertising
executive.
   Executives at all three networks said they are continuing
to negotiate with the diet center chain, and haven't made a
final decision to reject the ads. Executives also pointed out
they have stringent guidelines for claims made by all weight
loss programs. "We have a responsibility to work closely with
them to come up with mutually acceptable advertisements,"
said Matthew Margo, vice president of program practices at
CBS.
   Nutri/System's weight loss centers spent $31.1 million on
print and TV advertising last year, according to Leading
National Advertisers Inc. Eric Mower &amp; Assoc., a Syracuse
agency, coordinates media buying for Nutri/System, which is
in the process of selecting a new agency for creative work.
It couldn't be learned who created the proposed television
spots.
   Most Nutri/System ads fall into the familiar
"before-and-after" genre, where satisfied customers display
their newly trim figures and share tales of shedding pounds.
But given the scope of the marketing challenges Nutri/System
now faces, its traditional "We succeed where diets fail you"
pitch may no longer be enough to tempt new customers. Because
of the nature of its business, Nutri/System may be especially
prone to charges that its plan is unhealthy. Many consumers
who respond to the Nutri/System pitch are severely overweight
and hence especially vulnerable to a variety of ailments,
including gallbladder disease.
   The lawsuits filed last month in Dade County (Fla.)
Circuit Court allege that although Nutri/System touts its
program as "professionally supervised," and "nutritionally
sound," it doesn't employ qualified physicians and nurses to
supervise clients. Lawyers for the plaintiffs claim that as a
result of participating in the Nutri/System program, 17 women
had their gallbladders removed, although previously they had
never been diagnosed as having gallbladder problems.
   Nutri/System has said the suits are "without merit."
   Since the original suits were filed, more than 700 people
claiming to have experienced health problems after following
the Nutri/System plan have contacted the law offices of the
Miami attorneys handling the cases. Although the law firm is
still in the process of reviewing the new complaints, "we
anticipate filing additional claims," said Herman J.
Russomanno, one of the attorneys involved.
   The current controversy comes less than one month after a
congressional committee began investigating the entire $5
billion commercial diet market and its practices. During
hearings held on March 26, Federal Trade Commission Chairman
Janet Steiger told the subcommittee that her agency is
stepping up its scrutiny of advertising claims made by major
diet clinics and other weight-loss programs.
   In her testimony, Ms. Steiger also said the FTC is
currently involved in several non-public investigations into
the advertising claims made by several clinics, salons and
marketers of diet products. The government agency would not
release names of the companies under investigation.

   MOOSEHEAD: Guinness Import Co., Stamford, Conn., pulled
its Moosehead and Moosehead Light beer brands from
McCann-Erickson and said it plans to reassign the brands
soon. Guinness acquired the brands with its acquisition of
All Brands Importers earlier this year. The brands have been
relatively inactive. Separately, Guinness said it named
Carroll Raj Stagliano to handle its Kaliber imported
non-alcoholic beer account. Guinness Import is a unit of
Guinness PLC.
                                                                                                       

   MERGER: Levy, King &amp; White, a Buffalo, N.Y., agency with
about $25 million in billings, said it reached an agreement
in principle to form a new company with Eric Mower &amp;
Associates, a $50 million shop in Syracuse, N.Y. The new
company will be called LKW/Eric Mower &amp; Associates Inc.
Clients of the merged shop include Welch Foods, Aloca and
Syracuse China.

   Oil Prices Crash,
   Then Rebound
   In a Wild Day

   Petroleum prices crashed and then rebounded in one of the
wildest trading days ever on world oil markets.
   The volatility and heavy trading left prices in a
shambles, with oil analysts summing up the day's events in a
word: confusion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some analysts and traders admitted that after yesterday's
roller-coaster ride, with prices swinging more than $2 a
barrel in West Texas Intermediate crude, they had no idea
whether oil prices now will head higher or continue on their
recent downward trend. The U.S. benchmark crude for May
delivery closed 38 cents higher at $18.06 a barrel.
   A bearish view still seems widespread at the moment. But
several analysts and oil economists repeated previous
projections that the oil market should firm again by the end
of the second quarter, traditionally a sluggish demand
period.
   Meantime, a typical example of yesterday's pricing melee
came out of the oil fields of Texas. There, several more
refiners reduced their posted prices for West Texas
Intermediate $1 a barrel to $16.50, even as others increased
postings 50 cents to $17.
   Oil markets outside Texas were equally divided. By the end
of the trading day in European spot markets, North Sea and
Middle East crudes were down as much as $1.05 a barrel. But
in U.S. futures trading, the price of West Texas Intermediate
for May delivery fell like a rock in early trading. Then it
bounced back in an afternoon rally that had little more
support than the hope that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries was going to meet.
   Senior officials of some members of OPEC confirmed that
the oil ministers are consulting with each other by phone
over the state of the oil market, said to be deteriorating
because of excess OPEC output.
   But they again expressed doubt that there would be any
meeting of all 13 oil ministers before the regular midyear
conference, which is scheduled to begin May 25, probably in
Geneva. They didn't rule out an earlier meeting of the
influential monitoring committee of eight ministers, but
noted even that would be difficult because two religious
periods -- the Moslem Ramadan and the Christian Easter -- are
at hand.
   Still, midday news reports on speculation that OPEC might
hold an emergency session before May 25 to deal with the glut
triggered a rebound in prices of oil and fuels on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. May, June and July contracts for
gasoline and heating oil futures closed sharply higher --
some by more than one cent a gallon -- while West Texas
Intermediate for May delivery surged above the
psychologically important $18 mark.
   The June crude contract also was up 38 cents a barrel from
the Tuesday close.
   Before the rebound, in the opening hour of trading, both
crude contracts had plunged. May West Texas Intermediate fell
$1.48 a barrel, possibly a record decline for such a short
period. Its low for the day was $16.25 a barrel.
   "It was the most panicked day of trading I've seen in a
long time," said Vahan Zanoyan, senior director of
Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co. Others likened
yesterday's pricing hysteria to that of the 50% price
collapse in early 1986.
   There are similarities with 1986. But there also are major
differences, and most analysts and oil economists are still
looking for a solid price recovery by summer.
   "It has been clear there was going to be a serious problem
in the second quarter," said Humphrey Harrison, director of
energy research at the London brokerage firm of Kitcat &amp;
Aitken &amp; Co. "We will see up to a further $1 {a barrel}
drop," he added, "and then there will be a swift and strong
turnaround."
   But much depends on OPEC. "There isn't going to be a quick
fix," said Philip L. Dodge, oil analyst with Nomura
Securities International in New York, "but it looks like the
classic pattern of the past several years. Some members of
OPEC overproduce as long as they can -- and then get religion
temporarily."
   Indications of OPEC's high production of some 24 million
barrels a day -- two million above the group's ceiling --
came this week in fresh reports of expanding crude-oil
inventories in both Europe and the U.S.
   Many traders attributed yesterday's early-morning price
collapse, in fact, to a late Tuesday report by the American
Petroleum Institute that U.S. crude oil inventories had
increased more than eight million barrels last week.
Significantly, that put U.S. crude stocks 45 million barrels
above the year-earlier level.
   Even after yesterday's rebound, the near-month futures
price of West Texas Intermediate is some $5 a barrel under
this year's peak, reached in January. If oil prices remain at
this level or go lower, economists estimated there would be a
positive impact on inflation rates.
   As a rule of thumb, each $1-a-barrel drop in the price of
oil should trim one-tenth of one percent off the U.S.
inflation rate the first year, with some additional impact in
later years, said Joyce Yanchar, DRI/McGraw-Hill senior
economist.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COFFEE: May contracts fell 2.6 cents a pound to finish the
session at 95.17 cents. Analysts said Tuesday's price action
was psychologically bearish and set the market up for
yesterday's sell-off. In the Tuesday session, the market
failed to penetrate the $1-a-pound level and then retreated
to close nearly two cents a pound under the session's high.
The $1 level is considered an important technical-resistance
level. Celeste Georgakis, a commodity specialist at Cargill
Investors Services, New York, said Brazil would begin on
Monday to accept registrations for the export of coffee for
the next 12 months. She said, "Brazil is making a concerted
effort to reduce the role of government in the country's
economy." She pointed out that in furthering that goal, the
Brazilian Congress has approved the elimination of 22
government agencies concerned with the country's products;
that could have long-term bearish implications for Brazil's
exports, traders said. Yesterday's session reflected a
follow-through of Tuesday's weak close, according to Ms.
Georgakis. "The market was definitely overbought prior to
this recent decline and was due for a setback," she said.
Bernard Savaiko, senior commodity analyst at PaineWebber, New
York, said that when the market couldn't break the $1 level,
it began to encounter stop-loss orders, which quickly
exacerbated the sell-off. However, Mr. Savaiko said the
market wasn't far from a support area.
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: The May futures contract rose 2.55 cents to
settle at $1.9830 a pound in response to a Department of
Agriculture report. The report, released after Tuesday's
close, estimated the Florida crop to be 103.1 million boxes
based on data for April 1. The previous month's estimate was
for 103 million boxes. Traders were looking for an increase
of four million to five million boxes from the March
estimate. The report also reduced the current yield estimate
from 1.24 gallons a box to 1.21 gallons. Celeste Georgakis of
Cargill Investors Services, New York, said the smaller
estimate sparked a strong opening at $1.9850 a pound, with
follow-through buying sending the May contract to $2 before
profit-taking set in. "Speculative interests have been
shorting this market for sometime looking for a collapse.
With Tuesday's recent report they had no choice but to cover
their short positions," she said. She noted that tightness in
quality juice is continuing, and she sees no signs of an
imminent price collapse. She predicts a trading range in the
May and July contracts, during the next two months, from
$1.90 to $2.05. She added that she expects U.S. supplies will
continue to be supplemented by juice from Brazil. The harvest
on this year's Brazil crop won't begin until May.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices for pork-belly futures
contracts moved up the limit, as the market rallied to
encourage the industry to start putting more bellies away.
Analysts say the market was spurred by the fact that the
number of pork bellies going into cold storage in warehouses
outside of Chicago was less than expected. Last week, these
warehouses stored 934,000 pounds of pork bellies, while
traders were expecting between 1.5 million and 2.5 million
pounds. The previous week the warehouses had stored over
three million pounds. Hog-futures prices rose as a declining
slaughter "kept hog supplies relatively tight in the last
four to six weeks," says Tom Morgan, an analyst with Sterling
Research Corp. in Chicago. He notes that the slaughter, which
is normally higher in March and April, has declined
"contraseasonally," while there have been improvements in
demand for pork, particularly exports. Cattle futures traders
are speculating that the rise in the nearby cattle price
reflects a tight supply of animals ready for the market and a
strong cash price for cattle. "This furnished the futures
market with support to advance to the highest price level
ever paid for a live cattle future contract," says Charles
Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, Chicago. The
cattle contract for April delivery touched a new
life-of-contract high of 80.40 cents a pound before settling
at the end of the trading session at 80.37 cents a pound.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: The May contract ended 1.25 cents a pound lower at
$1.1810 in light trading, after reaching a high of $1.2020.
The market was driven lower initially by rumors that London
Metals Exchange stocks would be sharply higher when figures
are released on Tuesday. The London exchange will be closed
tomorrow and Monday, the usual day for release of copper
stocks. However, when no confirmation was forthcoming for
those rumors, the market rallied off of its lows. Betty
Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities, New York, said the market is trading on low
volume, which makes it unusually volatile. "Both sides of the
market are reluctant to hold positions overnight. Traders
with even small profits take them quickly," she said.

   Environment:
   Shell Pumps Cleaner Gas
   In `Dirtiest' Cities in U.S.

   HOUSTON -- Shell Oil Co. began selling an environmentally
cleaner gasoline at 2,000 stations in the "dirtiest" U.S.
cities. But motorists may have to pony up more green to make
their cars run clean.
   The effort by Shell is the broadest attempt by any oil
company to sell so-called reformulated gasoline designed to
reduce air pollution.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The introduction of the new fuel at this moment by the
nation's biggest marketer of gasoline also comes just as
Congress is hammering out new clean-air legislation that
could force unwelcome changes on the oil industry.
   Shell is selling its new gasoline in the nine metropolitan
areas often cited as having the most severe air-quality
problems. Moreover, the company is supplying its stations in
Washington, D.C., which isn't near the top of the dirty-air
list. Asked about the decision to add the nation's capital to
its roster, Shell said Washington is part of the same "air
shed" as Baltimore, which is high on the list.
   Some other oil companies applauded Shell's effort, but
downplayed the significance, in part because the industry has
had the ability to produce such gasoline for a while. "It's
not particularly revolutionary," said Allen Kozinski, vice
president of research and development of Amoco Corp.'s
gasoline operations. "It's no technical breakthrough," he
added. Like many oil companies, Amoco has been testing new
auto fuels.
   But so far, other companies selling reformulated gasoline
similar to Shell's are doing so only in select cities or only
for old-model cars. Almost any car can use Shell's
formulation.
   That's because it will replace Shell's current super
unleaded product in the markets involved, its highest-octane
and most-expensive grade of gasoline. Not surprisingly, super
unleaded fuels also carry the fattest profit margins in the
industry.
   Shell officials said it costs the company an extra two
cents a gallon to make the new product, called SU 2000E, but
they wouldn't say whether they will pass that cost on to
motorists. "It will be priced competitively in the
marketplace," according to Frank Richardson, chief executive
officer of Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group.
   Motorists who already buy top-of-the-line gasoline,
generally with octane levels above 90, may only feel a price
impact if market conditions allow Shell to pass along its
added costs, or if enthusiasm runs so high that it can charge
a premium over competitors' high-octane gasoline.
   But for motorists who normally buy regular or midgrade
gasoline and are motivated by environmental concern, a switch
to the new formula could pinch the pocketbook. In effect,
Shell is attempting the classic marketing tactic of trying to
induce customers to "buy up."
   Super unleaded -- Shell's and everyone else's -- can
easily cost 15 cents to 20 cents a gallon more than regular
unleaded at the pump. On a 15-gallon fill-up, an
environmentally conscious motorist would pay as much as an
extra $3 for the Shell fuel.
   Shell officials defended their selection of the high-price
end of the gasoline market for introduction of their cleaner
fuel. By making it a high-octane product, Shell said, the
fuel could be used by owners of the most powerful cars,
economy cars, old cars and new cars. If it were a lower
grade, it wouldn't be suitable for some of these categories.
   Also, "it's something we think the customer wants and
demands," said Steven Miller, president of Shell's refining
and marketing operations. He expects a much more enthusiastic
response than Shell received in 1970, when it launched a
cleaner, lead-free gas and the public didn't care. "It was a
technical success but a commercial failure," he said. Later,
lead-free fuels became a requirement for new cars.
   This time, he said, Shell views its new product as "only a
first step. The reformulation of gasoline has only just
begun."
   In Washington, William Rosenberg, a Bush administration
advocate of alternative fuels, praised Shell's efforts but
noted the gasoline isn't as clean as fuels being proposed for
1995 and beyond in clean-air legislation now moving through
Congress.
   Mr. Rosenberg, head of the clean-air office in the
Environmental Protection Agency, added that Shell's decision
to market to disparate cities should dispel logistical
concerns expressed by others in the oil industry about
distributing special fuels.
   Currently, other oil companies that are selling
reformulated gasoline have limited themselves. Atlantic
Richfield Co. sells a reformulated gas just on the West Coast
and only for older vehicles. The Marathon Petroleum Co. unit
of USX Corp. markets a new gasoline in all three octane
grades, but only in Detroit. In Denver, the Conoco Inc. unit
of Du Pont Co. sells reformulated gas; Amoco is testing
liquified natural gas for some fleet vehicles; and Phillips
Petroleum Co. is testing propane for others.
   Like others who have announced reformulated gasolines,
Shell said its version will reduce hydrocarbon and carbon
monoxide emissions. It said, for example, a car operating in
the summer in Los Angeles, which has the nation's worst
problem, would emit 10% less hydrocarbon vapors and 13% less
carbon monoxide. In New York, where the climate differs, the
reductions would be about 6% in each category.
   On the other hand, emissions of nitrogen oxides, an
ingredient in smog, will rise, though less than 2%.
Hydrocarbons are unburned fuel and contribute to ozone and
smog, which in turn can cause respiratory irritation. Carbon
monoxide is partly burned fuel and is poisonous.
   Shell uses an additive called methyl tertiary-butyl ether,
or MTBE, in place of butane to cut the gasoline's volatility
while enhancing its octane. The resulting fuel helps reduce
tailpipe emissions without hurting performance, and also cuts
the amount of fuel that evaporates from a vehicle, especially
on sunny days or in warm weather. Many areas of the country
have already required some reductions in volatility in the
summer.
   Shell hasn't touched two other controversial components of
gasoline, aromatics and olefins. A joint study by the auto
and oil industries is trying to determine whether reducing
their levels will benefit the environment.
   Officials of Shell said the company was considering
expanding production of the new gasoline, but that it can't
right now because of physical constraints. The company said
that while it's able to produce and distribute the new
gasoline with only a "modest" capital investment, any
expansion would be costly.

   Damon Group Inc., formerly American Magnetics Corp., said
it sold its electronics products business to the U.S. unit of
Britain-based System 4 International B.V., an
electronic-access control products distributor, for $12
million, including $8 million in cash and the remainder in a
subordinated note.
   Damon Group said the sale, expected to close by June 15,
is part of its refocusing on medical clinical laboratory
operations, following its acquisition through Nomad Partners
Limited Partnership last year of Damon, a Needham Heights,
Mass.-based biotechnology and medical laboratory concern.
Since the Damon acquisition, the company also has sold its
hobby products and medical equipment businesses, and a

   Craig Corp., Los Angeles, said it was restating downward
its earnings for the first quarter, ended Dec. 31. The move
reflects Craig's share of nonrecurring losses in December by
Reading Co. in which Craig then held a 20% stake.
   Craig, with interests in retail supermarkets and the
importing of photographic accessories, said it restated its
first-quarter earnings to $1.5 million, or 32 cents a share.
Previously, the company reported earnings of $1.7 million, or
38 cents a share.

   Edward Kane, president of Craig, said he expects results
for Philadelphia-based Reading, which has interests in real
estate and manufacturing, "would be positive in the future."
Craig now holds 34.3% of Reading's Class A common stock.

   Wang Laboratories Inc., Lowell, Mass., said that, as part
of a continuing effort to pare debt, it agreed to sell its
stock quotation service to a new unit of New York-based
Infotechnology Inc., which owns 47% of Financial News Network
and owns United Press International. Terms weren't disclosed.
   The computer maker said it will take a book loss of less

Financial Information Services Corp. subsidiary. Wang
previously said it expects to report a loss for its third
quarter ended March 31, because of continuing slow sales.

   Wang has said that after completion of the sale of the
unit and previously announced agreements to sell its
international lease financing business and InteCom
subsidiary, its debt will have been reduced to less than $93
million. Last August, Wang's debt was $575 million, and heavy
interest costs in part forced management changes, layoffs and
the sale of "non-strategic assets" to raise cash.

   First Chicago Corp. shareholder sued the company, claiming
it violated securities law by misleading investors about its
financial condition.
   The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago,
alleges that in 1989 and early 1990, the bank holding company
failed to disclose "adverse material information" and issued
"overly optimistic statements" about its prospects.

   On March 29, First Chicago disclosed that its
first-quarter earnings will be down about 50% because of
increased problems in its real-estate loan portfolio. First
Chicago, parent of First National Bank of Chicago, said it
expects to set aside between $150 million and $160 million
for loan losses in the quarter. The company had provided
similar information to analysts more than a week before the
public announcement.
   The lawsuit, filed by Edward J. Kunze, seeks class action
status. The complaint, which also names certain company
officials as defendants, seeks undetermined damages. A First
Chicago spokeswoman declined to comment, citing a company
policy against discussing litigation.

   Default Rate Falls Slightly

   WASHINGTON -- The default rate on federally guaranteed
student loans fell slightly, but Education Department
officials said the decline probably doesn't reflect the
impact of a new program to reduce defaults of tuition loans.
   The default rate fell to 15.6% in fiscal 1988 from 17.3%
in fiscal 1987. Officials said that about 2.5 million loans,
totaling $9.2 billion, entered the repayment phase in fiscal
1988 and that about 385,000 loans, totaling $1.1 billion,
were in default by the end of fiscal 1989, which ended Sept.
30. A loan doesn't fall into default until a payment is 180
days overdue.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last June, the government launched a default reduction
program aimed at schools with default rates of more than 20%.
Of the 5,226 post-secondary schools tracked by the Education
Department, nearly 1,600 have default rates of more than 20%.
If these institutions don't lower their default rates, their
ability to offer guaranteed student loans will be limited or
suspended. Last year, the department reported that vocational
schools had the highest default rates, followed by two-year
colleges and then four-year colleges.
   Some of the reduction in the default rate reflects
technical changes in the way the rate is calculated. Without
these changes, the default rate would have been 16.5%, rather
than 15.6%.

   TORONTO -- John Kachmar resigned as president and chief
executive officer of Dickenson Mines Ltd. after management
lost a proxy battle with the gold mining company's major
shareholder, which succeeded in unseating two of Dickenson's
directors.
   Robert McEwen, chairman of Dickenson and president of
Toronto-based Goldcorp Investments Ltd., which owns 70% of
Dickenson's shares, said the company's direction won't change
because of the resignation of Mr. Kachmar, 53 years old.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dickenson board later elected Mr. McEwen to the
additional post of chief executive. David Libby, chief
operating officer, was named to the additional position of
president.
   Mr. Kachmar, who has led Dickenson for the past nine
years, said at the annual meeting that his resignation is
"part of an orderly and normal process." He said he will
remain a Dickenson director, but he wouldn't elaborate on the
reasons for his resignation from the executive posts.
   In the proxy battle, two of Dickenson's directors were
succeeded by Goldcorp nominees. Mr. McEwen said the rival
nominations were made to place more mining engineers on the
Dickenson board.
   James McCartney, a long-term Dickenson director who lost
his seat, said Mr. Kachmar agreed to resign under pressure
from Mr. McEwen. Mr. McCartney, a lawyer, said the change in
top management breaches a covenant of Dickenson's 38 million
Canadian dollar (US$32.8 million) gold loan and will probably
lead to Dickenson's having to refinance the loan on less
favorable terms.
   Mr. McEwen said his views "differ" from Mr. McCartney's,
but he wouldn't elaborate.

   WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp., anticipating a
big speed-up in sales of sick savings and loans, received
authorization to borrow up to $45.3 billion in working
capital from the Treasury this quarter.
   The savings-and-loan bailout agency has said it plans to
sell or liquidate 141 thrifts in the second quarter. It
requires the cash to manage bad investments that buyers of
sick thrifts don't take over, and also to pay off depositors
at liquidated thrifts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The working capital is to be repaid with revenue from
selling the bad investments of insolvent savings and loans.
The borrowing is expected to add to the total cost of the
bailout only the amount of interest the agency must pay on
the Treasury bonds, but that could total $28 billion over 30
years, according to government estimates.
   In the first quarter, the agency received authority from
its oversight board to spend $11 billion of the temporary
capital. Most of that cash wasn't spent, as sales of problem
thrifts slowed.

   Societe Generale reported in Paris that its consolidated

told a news conference that the 1989 performance was "more
than acceptable," with consolidated net profit after payments
to minority interests climbing to 3.56 billion francs from
3.04 billion in 1988 despite an inversion of the domestic
interest-rate curve that substantially cut profits from bond
market operations.

   Mr. Vienot asserted that the weakness of bond market
operations was offset, however, by an "exceptional" rise in

to customers rising 15% to 475 billion francs while client
deposits climbed 10% to 362 billion.

   Partnership Holds

   A partnership controlled by David H. Batchelder, a former
strategist for T. Boone Pickens, disclosed that it holds a
6.6% stake in Pic 'N' Save Corp. and plans to make a bid to
acquire the company.
   The bid has an indicated value of about $447 million,
based on Pic 'N' Save's roughly 35.5 million shares
outstanding. The company, based in Dominguez, Calif., is a
retail chain that buys manufacturers' close-out merchandise
and sells it at deep discounts to customers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Girard Partners Limited Partnership said in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission that it owns 2,365,100
Pic 'N' Save common shares, including shares bought from Feb.
12 to April 5 for $9.87 to $12.01 a share.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Pic 'N' Save shares
closed at $13.50, up 50 cents. The Girard filing surfaced
after trading ended.
   William M. Jacobs Jr., the retailer's senior vice
president and chief financial officer, answered questions
about the company and its business but declined to comment on
the Girard filing. The company's shares have been active in
recent sessions in the wake of reports that someone was
accumulating the stock.
   In the filing, Girard said it plans to solicit consents
from shareholders to approve a resolution calling for a
five-member board consisting of a majority of Girard
nominees. Pic 'N' Save's board now has eight members.
Officers and directors own less than 5% of the company's
stock.
   The written-consents process is an increasingly popular
mechanism for acquiring management control, similar to a
proxy solicitation, which doesn't require a shareholder
meeting. Girard said its nominees, if elected, would seek
acquisition proposals for a negotiated sale of the company to
the partnership or to another bidder. Girard said it is
initiating discussions with potential lending sources
regarding financing an acquisition.
   Mr. Batchelder left Mr. Pickens's Mesa Limited Partnership
two years ago and formed his own investment firm in La Jolla,
Calif. Last year, Mr. Batchelder advised Los Angeles investor
Marvin Davis in his failed attempts to buy NWA Inc., parent
of Northwest Airlines, and UAL Corp., parent of United
Airlines. The Pic 'N' Save bid apparently is Mr. Batchelder's
first major takeover attempt on his own steam. Mr. Batchelder
didn't return calls from a reporter.
   Pic 'N' Save was founded more than four decades ago in
Southern California, went public in 1971, and in recent years
has expanded into New York, New Jersey, Texas and other
states. Last month, the company reported "disappointing" 1989
results. Net income fell 34% to $30.9 million, or 87 cents a
share, on sales of $475.2 million. The company has 189
stores.

   DAYTON, Ohio -- Mead Corp. reported a 25% decline in
first-quarter earnings because of lower prices for some types
of paper and heavy spending for new products and facilities.
   The forest products and electronic publishing concern
earned $39.5 million, or 62 cents a share, down from $52.6
million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales crept up
1.1% to $1.14 billion from $1.13 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Net income was 10% to 20% higher than many analysts had
been expecting. Mark S. Rogers, paper analyst with
Prudential-Bache securities, said net was well above the 50
cents a share he had forecast, but, like other analysts
contacted, he hadn't had a chance to obtain detailed numbers
that would show where profits exceeded his expectations.
   Lower prices for uncoated papers and corrugating medium
were a major factor in the earnings decline, officials said.
Uncoated papers are used in copiers, computer printers and
other office applications. Corrugating medium is used to make
containers.
   The $560 million expansion program under way at the
company's coated paperboard plant at Mahrt, Ala., disrupted
production of existing facilities at the site, Mead said.
Also, the company is incurring wage and training costs for
the people who will operate the new facilities beginning late
in the 1990 third quarter. A planned shutdown to modernize a
paper machine at Escanaba, Mich., also cut into earnings. The
company also is spending heavily to develop its new color
copying business, which Mead calls Cycolor.
   Mead Data Central Inc., the company's electronic
publishing subsidiary, and Zellerbach, a paper products
distribution unit, had slightly higher first-quarter profit,
Mead said.

   CHICAGO -- United Airlines said it is decreasing its
cheapest, most-restricted fares between some Northeast cities
and California by an average of 15% for travel from May 1
through June 11.
   The UAL Corp. unit said the move is an attempt to spark
transcontinental traffic during a typically slow travel
period between the Easter and Passover holidays and summer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's unclear whether the move will spread to other markets
but it appears to be a limited pricing move. "It sounds
pretty isolated," said Robert Decker, an airlines analyst at
Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. Other carriers are expected to
match the action.
   United said the new round-trip fare levels will be $358
for off-peak travel between noon Monday and noon Thursday,
and $398 for peak travel during the rest of the week. The
move represents a cut of $60 to $70 from current fares.
   Ticket restrictions are tight, requiring a Saturday night
stay and ticket purchase 14 days before travel and 24 hours
after making a reservation. Also, the fares are
nonrefundable.

   This Refined Commodity Play
   Turns Crude Oil Into Gasoline

   You can refine crude oil into gasoline or crush soybeans
into meal without getting your hands dirty.
   All you need is an account at a commodities broker -- plus
a willingness to make a fairly complicated trade with some
significant risk. Product spreads in crude oil and soybeans
are traded every day -- even by people who wouldn't recognize
a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude or a bushel of
soybeans if they were sitting next to one of them.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though the raw materials used in oil refineries and
soybean processing plants are not similar, the mechanics of
trading product spreads based on them are nearly identical.
In each case, one side of the spread is the futures contract
for the raw material. The other side of the spread is the
contract based on what is made from the raw material-gasoline
and heating oil in one case, or soybean meal and soybean oil
in the other.
   A futures contract is an obligation to buy or deliver a
specified quantity of a commodity, such as soybeans or
gasoline, at the agreed-upon price by a certain date. In
practice, however, most futures contracts aren't used to
transfer ownership of a commodity, but are simply nullified
by opposite trades.
   Traders of commodity product spreads do so for two reasons
-- the lower risk and less money required to secure positions
than in some other futures trades. The lower risk comes about
from the hedged nature of the spreads. For example, usually
if the price of crude oil goes up, so will the price of the
products made from it. But the products do not move in
perfect lockstep with the raw material from which they are
made; if they did, there would be neither risk nor a profit
opportunity from trading product spreads.
   Consider an example of a so-called crack spread. Because
about 70% of the crude oil in a barrel is refined, or
"cracked," into gasoline and heating oil, it is possible to
set up a trade between crude oil and its major products. The
most common trade assumes that three barrels of crude are
refined into two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of
heating oil.
   Unfortunately, the three contracts are not quoted on the
same basis. A crude oil contract is 1,000 barrels of 42
gallons each, priced in dollars per barrel. The gasoline and
heating oil contracts are each 42,000 gallons and are quoted
in dollars per gallon. The accompanying table shows how to
put all three commodities on a common basis.
   Traders believe that a refiner turning three barrels of
crude into two barrels of gasoline and one barrel of heating
oil requires that the value of the products exceeds the value
of the crude by approximately $3 a barrel to break even.
Currently, a commodities broker will ask an investor to
deposit a minimum of $3,000 in margin or good-faith money to
initiate a trade on a crack spread using the 3:2:1 ratio.
   While an investor doesn't need a lot of money to trade a
crack spread, a move of only $1 a barrel in the spread
between crude oil and product prices would produce a profit
or loss of $3,000 per spread trade. Since May 1988, the
premium of the products over crude oil has ranged from under
$1 a barrel in February 1989 to over $10 a barrel in December
1989, reflecting the supply and demand both for crude oil and
for its refined products. The futures contracts for crude
oil, heating oil and gasoline in a crack spread all trade on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   A few weeks ago, Philip Gotthelf, publisher of the
Commodity Futures Forecast, decided that a reverse crack
spread looked appealing. So he recommended buying contracts
for heating oil and gasoline and selling the crude-oil
contract with the spread at around $4 a barrel. He believed
that both the Soviet Union and Mexico were ready to sell
large quantities of crude oil to raise foreign exchange.
Whatever the cause, he was right about the trade; the premium
of the products over crude has now moved up to about $4.73 a
barrel as the supply of crude oil has increased.
   Soybeans have a value only after they have been crushed,
converting them from a legume into soybean meal, widely used
as an animal feed, and soybean oil, used in many food
products. A "crush spread" is set up by buying soybean
futures contracts and selling the contracts for soybean meal
and soybean oil, hoping that the products' value will
decrease over the value of the beans. A "reverse crush" is
initiated when an investor believes the value of the products
will increase relative to the value of the beans.
   And just as in the energy trade, the three futures
contracts of the crush spread aren't quoted on a common
basis. Soybeans are quoted in dollars per bushel, with a
contract equal to 5,000 bushels. A soybean meal contract is
for 100 tons, with the price stated in dollars per ton; the
soybean oil contract is for 60,000 pounds, with a price
specified in dollars per pound.
   To place the three commodities on a common basis, it is
necessary to take into account that a bushel of soybeans will
crush into about 48 pounds of meal and 11 pounds of oil. The
value of the products in excess of the value of the beans is
termed the crush margin. The table details how the conversion
is carried out.
   This spread is frequently done using one contract of each
of the three commodities. For this ratio, an investor would
have to post good-faith or margin money of about $400 to
initiate a crush or reverse crush trade. However, a more
accurate match between soybeans and its products is obtained
by using 10 soybean contracts, 12 meal contracts and nine oil
contracts. This trade would require margin money of about
$4,000. Contracts for soybeans and soybean products all trade
on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A common crush spread involves the November soybean
contract and the December contracts for meal and oil. During
the 1986-87 crop year beginning September 1, the value of the
products over the beans sank to an 11-year-low of only 20.7
cents per bushel. During the 1989-90 crop year, this premium
set an 11-year high of $1.49 a bushel. Over 11 years, the
crush spread moved on average by 51 cents a year, or $2,550
per spread trade. When the spread is done using one contract
each of beans, meal and oil, each penny change in the crush
margin is worth $50 in profit or loss to an investor.
   Mr. Gotthelf of Commodity Futures Forecast believes the
Soviet Union is going to be more interested in buying
soybeans than the products. That would lead him to consider
doing a crush spread by buying the beans and selling the
products. "Historically, beans are cheap," he says.

   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- First Union Corp. reported that
first-quarter earnings fell to $71 million, or 67 cents a
share, from $72 million, or 68 cents a share, a year ago.
   However, the regional banking company said results
improved in all of its state banking operations over the
fourth quarter, including Georgia where it had run into
costly delays consolidating operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The results were better than most analysts had expected.
Analysts had been wary of the impact of a heavy load of
problem assets stemming from First Union's recent acquisition
of troubled Florida National Banks of Florida Inc.
   Some analysts also remained skeptical following First
Union's earlier announcement that a recent federal
examination of its Florida commercial real estate portfolio
had turned up no significant problems. Further examinations
of First Union's real estate operations in Georgia, South
Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee are scheduled for some
time this quarter.
   The company said Florida National accounted for $234
million of the $272 million increase over last year in First
Union's nonperforming assets, including problem loans, to
$502 million. The company's provision for loan losses also
grew in the period to $24 million from $14 million a year
earlier.
   First Union said, however, it expects to squeeze $40
million worth of expense savings out of the Florida National
merger both this year and next. "Our strongest focus in this
regard is on gaining the merger efficiencies in Florida,"
said Chairman Edward Crutchfield Jr.

   Siliconix Inc., Santa Clara, Calif., said it filed for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code, partly because of an unfavorable verdict in a patent
infringement suit.
   A federal judge ruled earlier this week that Siliconix, a
maker of semiconductor products, had infringed on patents
relating to certain advanced power transistor technology held
by International Rectifier Corp. Damages and penalties
haven't been determined yet. The lawsuit has been pending for
four years.

   Siliconix also said it is currently in technical default
of certain lending agreements with its banks, which include
First Interstate Bancorp. In 1989, Siliconix had a net loss
of $30 million on sales of $122.5 million.
   The company didn't disclose its assets or debts, and
couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

   HomeFed Corp. said first-quarter net income rose 13%, to a
record $34.5 million, or $1.48 a fully diluted share.
   The San Diego, Calif.-based thrift cited increased net
interest income and tight expense controls. HomeFed also
benefited from an improving net-interest margin, the
difference between what it pays for funds and what it earns
on its assets. That at least partly reflects one positive
aspect of the much-maligned thrift bailout bill. The bill has
led to a reduction in cost of funds by putting some desperate
thrifts, which have to pay more to attract money and bid up
interest rates, out of business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the year-earlier period, HomeFed earned $30.5 million,
or $1.31 a share.
   HomeFed said net interest income totaled $116 million, 14%
above the year-earlier quarter's $101.7 million. Its
net-interest margin was 2.87, compared with 2.70 a year
earlier.

   GORBACHEV WARNED that changing internal borders would
prompt unrest.
   Amid a secession bid by Lithuania, the Soviet leader said
in televised remarks that redrawing the internal borders
would lead to "bloody carnage." More than 100 ethnic groups
inhabit the Soviet Union, and many are clamoring for lands
that were historically theirs and for more freedom from
Moscow. He also accused a bloc of Communist Party
progressives of wanting to restore capitalism, and the
Kremlin decided against an economic embargo on Lithuania.

   EAST GERMAN LEADERS REACHED agreement on forming a
government.
   After three weeks of talks, Prime Minister-designate de
Maiziere announced a coalition of conservatives, Social
Democrats, and liberal parties. The government is expected to
be endorsed by the legislature today, clearing the way for
reunification talks with West Germany. The coalition accord
appeared to be a compromise between the Social Democrats, who
favor a slow approach, and the conservatives, who want a
quick merger.
   The U.S. rejected a suggestion by Soviet Foreign Minister
Shevardnadze that a united Germany temporarily be part of
both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.

   ISRAEL'S PERES FAILED in an attempt to form a new

   In a blow to prospects for early peace talks with
Palestinians, two religious lawmakers defected from the Labor
Party leader's coalition just as the Knesset was about to
begin a special session to approve the cabinet. Israeli
President Herzog gave Peres an additional 15 days to form a
government to replace the coalition that collapsed March 15
over Prime Minister Shamir's refusal to accept U.S. proposals
for Mideast peace.
   Herzog, in an apparent reference to Israel's electoral
system, said recent political haggling raised "questions
about . . . our political culture."

   Unisys, Honeywell
   Face Lawsuit by U.S.
   On Defense Job Costs

   NEW YORK -- The Brooklyn U.S. attorney's office filed
suit, charging Sperry Corp., Unisys Corp. and Honeywell Inc.
with defrauding the government by inflating cost estimates on
defense work.
   In 1986, Sperry and Burroughs Corp. merged to become
Unisys. Later that year, Honeywell bought the Unisys division
cited in the lawsuit, a maker of flight simulators to train
pilots.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Spokesmen for Unisys, a Blue Bell, Pa., computer maker,
and Honeywell, a Minneapolis business-machines company, said
the companies hadn't been served with the suit and couldn't
comment.
   The suit, which seeks at least $48 million in damages,
charges that in 1979 and 1980, Sperry underbid on one
flight-trainer contract by $1.5 million to get a leg up on
competitors when two succeeding contracts came up for bids.
Sperry was awarded the next two pacts as well, but in its
cost proposals prepared after the awards, it secretly
inflated its anticipated costs, the complaint charges.
   Earlier, a similar suit was filed by a former Sperry
executive, Ralph F. D'Avino, under the federal
"whistleblower" provision of the False Claims Act, according
to the law firm that represents him, Baden Kramer Huffman &amp;
Brodsky here. Last Monday, U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney's
office filed a superseding complaint.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Honeywell
disclosed "preliminary discussions" with the government about
alleged "false claims and statements" by Sperry and Unisys.
Honeywell said that the government indicated its single
damage claim could total $48 million, but that the complaint
seeks treble damages. Honeywell's filing said the action
"stems from facts and circumstances arising, in significant
part, prior to the company's acquisition of this portion of
its business from Unisys." Thus, Honeywell said it believes
it is covered by contractual indemnification provided by
Unisys.
   Separately, Unisys and partner Westinghouse Electric
Corp., Pittsburgh, lost a contract to build part of the
Navy's Aegis radar system.
   In late March, Unisys said, the Navy "decided to
discontinue second sourcing," dropping Unisys and
Westinghouse, a defense, electrical-products and broadcasting
concern. The first source is General Electric Co., a
Fairfield, Conn., broadcaster and defense and industrial
products company.
   Unisys received the contract in April 1988. The company
said it expects to pare some of the 4,000 employees at its
Shipboard &amp; Ground Systems unit in Great Neck, N.Y., but
isn't sure how many. The first phase of the project was
valued at $10 million for Unisys; the second phase, which was
under way when the Navy dropped the second sources, had a $90
million value to Unisys. A Westinghouse spokesman couldn't be
reached to comment.

   VICTORIA, British Columbia -- The British Columbia
government said it plans to preserve as parkland more than
half of the 26-square-mile Carmanah Valley, a battleground
between environmentalists and loggers that reputedly contains
Canada's tallest trees.
   The decision, following months of debate between
environmental groups and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., a forest
products firm that has cutting rights to the timber, was an
attempt at compromise that apparently satisfied neither side.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   MacMillan Bloedel said the move would cost 150 jobs and
could set a precedent for other land-use disputes, which
currently affect about 30% of a license area on Vancouver
Island that includes Carmanah, and about 3% of the province's
total timber-cutting land.
   The Western Canada Wilderness Committee, an environmental
group, said it is considering court action to block the plan,
which requires legislation before it can proceed.
   MacMillan Bloedel, 49.9%-owned by Noranda Forest Inc., a
unit of Toronto resource giant Noranda Inc., had proposed to
set aside a 1,300-acre tract on the valley floor that
contains the oldest trees, including a 311-foot Sitka spruce
that is believed to be the world's tallest.
   Forests Minister Claude Richmond said compensation that
must be paid to MacMillan Bloedel for the loss of
timber-cutting rights "could amount to millions of dollars."

   RICHARD J. RIORDAN is a 59-year-old lawyer, investment
banker, restaurateur, real estate man and venture capitalist
with a passion for education. He wants every child to be
reading and writing in the first grade. "If children cannot
do that," he says, "we have lost them for life."
   His efforts have been applied to more than 500 schools and
50,000 five- and six-year-olds and he is now helping to put
the system into every elementary school in Mississippi, a
state laboring under an appalling illiteracy rate.
   Mr. Riordan's crusade was sparked by a 1983 Carnegie
Foundation report arguing that language was the key to all
learning and that children should master it by the fourth
grade at the latest. After exploring what schools were doing,
Mr. Riordan concluded that computers could help achieve that
goal.
   At first, the Riordan Foundation, the vehicle used for the
Los Angeles lawyer's philanthropies, concentrated on
parochial schools in that city. Mr. Riordan is education
chairman for the archdiocese of Los Angeles and thanks to his
fund-raising efforts, 103 of its 200 parochial schools now
have a computerized learning system in which children and
personal computers "talk" to each other, letting children
write the words they can say and read the words they can
write.
   Public schools have been added to the program and it has
now spread to New York, Trenton, N.J., Orange County, Calif.,
and Kansas City, Mo. Mr. Riordan's role has been to combine
his own funds with those of local sources to finance the
programs.
   Mississippi's statewide program is Mr. Riordan's most
ambitious by far. This phase began after the state's
41-year-old governor, Raymond Mabus, met Mr. Riordan while on
an industry-promotion tour in California and invited him to
the Executive Mansion for lunch. The governor has big plans
for education in Mississippi and the
computer-in-the-classroom approach, dubbed Writing-to-Read,
is part of them.
   Mr. Riordan's approach is to act as a catalyst, putting up
his own money but raising the ante by enlisting the aid of
others with similar views. For the Mississippi program, he
put up $1 million. He then called on Robert Dowling, a New
York entrepreneur who has been a close friend since
grade-school days in New Rochelle, N.Y. Mr. Dowling responded
with a $500,000 gift of his own. Mr. Riordan also pledged to
raise $5.5 million more over four years.
   The privately raised money went to International Business
Machines Corp., which installed 72 Writing-to-Read labs in 60
schools during the summer of 1989, a job that entailed not
only computers but new electrical outlets, desks, security
devices, lettered tiles for word-making, and a host of other
items. By the time the 1989 fall terms began, the
Writing-to-Read program was a fact. The goal is to have it
working in all 532 Mississippi grade schools by 1993.
   Mr. Riordan's lunch with Gov. Mabus and the program it
produced did not go unnoticed. The lawyer has had calls from
the governors of Louisiana, Indiana and West Virginia asking
for help in developing their own computer programs. The
Riordan Foundation has also held meetings with business
groups from Arkansas and Chicago.
   For Richard Riordan and his partners, the interest of the
business groups is especially gratifying. "Illiteracy is not
only evil and sinful," Mr. Riordan says, "it is extremely bad
business."

   PARIS -- Source Perrier S.A. officials say the U.S.
relaunch of their bubbly water now is a week or two behind
schedule, because of delays in rebuilding inventory and in
obtaining a U.S. Food and Drug Administration review.
   One month ago they announced that their green bottles
would be back in stores on the East Coast by the first week
of April, and on the West Coast by the third week of April.
Now they say it will be around April 23 before the East Coast
relaunch, and early May for the West Coast. Inland, it could
be as late as the end of May before stores have Perrier
again.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Britain, however, Perrier was relaunched on time, on
April 4, accompanied by a new advertising campaign.
   Perrier announced a world-wide recall of its mineral water
in February, after trace levels of benzene were found in it
by U.S. scientists. Benzene is a suspected cause of cancer,
although U.S. and French authorities say the amount in
Perrier was too low to present a real health hazard.
   Perrier says benzene always has been present in the
natural carbon dioxide gas it uses to increase its water's
carbonization. It says it failed to change filters frequently
enough on the pipes that supply carbon dioxide gas to its
bottling plant in the south of France.
   Perrier officials say one purpose of the U.S. delay is to
avoid shortages.

   Cable TV Is Newest Wrinkle

   The fierce battle between the Los Angeles Times and the
Orange County Register newspapers for the hearts and minds of
one of California's richest counties has entered a new arena:
cable television news.
   The Orange County edition of the Times is teaming with
Walt Disney Co.'s KCAL-TV in Los Angeles and Turner
Broadcasting Inc.'s Cable News Network to produce a TV news
program for Orange County, home to more than two million
people south of Los Angeles. The show is believed to be the
first news venture to join a newspaper, TV station and cable
operators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The service, set to debut Monday, will consist of 4
1/2-minute news summaries appearing every half hour on
Turner's CNN Headline News. The segments will be produced by
KCAL's regular news staff in Hollywood from its own coverage
and stories in the Times's Orange County edition.
   In January, the Register's owners unveiled plans for a
cable TV service to air next fall. To carry the service,
dubbed Orange County NewsChannel, cable operators have been
recruited representing about 200,000 subscribers, or about
half the cable households in the county. The Times, which
first reported the new venture in yesterday's editions, said
it initially will be available to about the same number of
subscribers as the Register's service.
   Executives at the Times and Freedom Newspapers Inc., which
owns the Register, stressed the differences in their ventures
and downplayed the competitive aspects. The Times is owned by
Times Mirror Co.
   The Times-KCAL venture is for brief local segments that
would air as part of an existing national news program.
Freedom Newspapers is planning a 24-hour news program geared
to Orange County.
   "There's plenty of room for both services," said Alan J.
Bell, president of Freedom Newspapers's broadcasting
division. Jeffrey S. Klein, assistant to the Times's
publisher noted that there isn't anything to prevent a cable
company from carrying both services. Orange County is
underserved by local television stations that mainly feature
Los Angeles news, both men agreed.
   "What Freedom is doing is much more risky and ambitious,"
said Tom Adams, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates Inc., a
Carmel, Calif., media research firm. It's unclear whether
there's an appetite for local round-the-clock news. But Mr.
Adams predicted that in the current depressed advertising
environment more newspapers will be looking at TV and other
ventures that enable them to "repackage the news for profit."
   Mr. Bell said that Freedom is "starting from scratch" and
recruiting a whole staff of TV news people. Freedom is
investing "multiple millions of dollars" in the project, he
said. Mr. Bell was president of the broadcasting group of
Lorimar-Telepictures Corp. until last year. For seven years
in the 1970s, he was vice president and general manager of
the NBC-TV affiliate in Philadelphia.
   KCAL, purchased by Disney in 1988, recently launched an
innovative three-hour prime-time news program that has been
struggling in local ratings. News director Bob Henry said
that the Times would become a "new source of editorial
material for us." KCAL has 10 television vans, but no Orange
County bureau. KCAL will have access to some stories before
they are published in the Times, although the newspaper would
be able to preserve certain stories' exclusivity, Mr. Henry
said.
   The Orange County edition of the Times has daily
circulation of about 196,000. The Register, published in
Santa Ana, Calif., has daily circulation of about 347,679.

   Heard on the Street:
   Kodak Seems a Pretty Picture to One Analyst
   But Patent Suit by Polaroid Scares Off Others

   PITTSBURGH -- A veteran Eastman Kodak watcher named Eugene
Glazer had a nightmare the other night. He dreamed that Kodak
was ordered to pay $3 billion in damages to settle the patent
case won by Polaroid in 1985.
   Mr. Glazer, a Dean Witter analyst, has reason to toss and
turn. After two years of keeping a "neutral to negative"
rating on Kodak, he recently took a warmer view of the shares
of the Rochester, N.Y., marketer of photographic, chemical
and drug products.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most of his colleagues disagree. They see the Polaroid
legal situation as sufficient reason to avoid the stock for
now. A decision on damages is expected soon, as a judge
appears nearly ready to impose an award if a settlement isn't
reached. And the Street consensus is that Kodak will have to
pay between $1 billion and $2 billion for infringing on
Polaroid's instant-photography patents.
   Other negatives loom: Revenue remains sluggish in the face
of weak foreign currencies. A lackluster economy is dragging
down Kodak's chemical division, which posted excellent
results last year. The information segment, which includes
copiers and electronic printers, was plagued by high costs
and production problems last year, and still isn't generating
as much revenue as expected. Savings from the company's
current pruning programs, which some believe are too little,
too late, won't come until the second half.
   David Nelson, analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, figures
that Kodak's stock could fall an additional 10% to 15%. "We
think Kodak is a cheap stock but there's no reason to think
it will be less cheap in the immediate future," he says. "A
trust officer at a bank would have a tough sell pushing
investment in Kodak, particularly in advance of the damage
settlement."
   The only thing that would change his outlook is
surprisingly strong earnings -- and that isn't in the cards,
Mr. Nelson asserts. Wall Street, too, is doubtful. The
consensus forecast for full-year earnings has been falling.
Now, most analysts predict Kodak will earn less than $4 a
share, down from the $4.30 they were estimating last fall.
Profit for 1989 was $3.32 a share before $875 million in
restructuring charges.
   So why is Mr. Glazer so optimistic? Based on his profit
estimate for this year, Kodak trades at a 35% discount from
the price-earnings ratios of the market's industrial stocks
in general -- mainly because, in his view, it already
reflects all the bad news.
   At yesterday's close of 39 7/8 in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, Kodak is near its 52-week low of 36
7/8. Mr. Glazer believes Kodak could trade at 49 a share
within a year in a flat stock market, based on estimated 1990
earnings of $4.10 a share.
   He sees good news in Kodak's fundamental operations.
Cost-cutting programs should yield savings soon, he says,
raising the potential for an upside earnings surprise in
subsequent quarters. He estimates savings at $350 million in
1990, and $450 million to $500 million annually -- about $1 a
share -- in years beyond.
   Moreover, pricing pressures on the crucial film and
photographic paper businesses seem to have eased. Kodak,
which has been unable to put through price increases in
recent years because of tough competition, recently raised
prices as much as 5% on amateur film. And rivals have seemed
willing to follow Kodak's lead.
   There are a lot of "ifs" in Mr. Glazer's scenario. For one
thing, he doesn't factor in any changes in the currency. He
also assumes the economy will slow but won't plunge into a
recession.
   As for the black cloud of Polaroid, he says, Wall Street
already has discounted Kodak stock to account for a $1
billion to $2 billion award.
   But Wall Street seems to feel that investors are braced
for an award of as much as $2 billion. In fact, if the
settlement is below $2 billion, Kodak's stock could rise, Mr.
Glazer says. (Of course, he concedes, Kodak's stock could
drop $2 a share for every $1 billion above a $2 billion
determination.)
   Once the damages are determined, he thinks other
contrarians, who have sat on the sidelines for fear of a huge
settlement, will begin buying Kodak stock. Particularly prime
for investment are institutional investors, which hold only
48% of Kodak stock compared with a more typical 65% to 70%
for large-company stocks.
   "The only thing holding {the institutions} out is the fear
of an upside surprise on damages," he contends. "It's an
ideal contrarian type of stock."

   U.S. Will Help
   Northrop Ex-Aide
   In Overbilling Suit
   ----

   LOS ANGELES -- Northrop Corp.'s legal problems mounted as
the Justice Department indicated it would help litigate a
whistle-blower's suit alleging that the company overbilled
the Navy on the F/A-18 strike fighter.
   The government's intervention in the matter, unsealed in
federal court here, is a big lift for Eldon Janssen, the
former Northrop employee who brought the civil action in
1987.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Northrop spokesman declined to comment, saying the
company hadn't yet reviewed the court filing. The aerospace
concern's outside counsel, Joe Coyne, would say only that he
was "confident of prevailing."
   Mr. Janssen was a manager of contracts and pricing at the
division where Northrop builds the center and aft fuselage
sections of the F/A-18 for prime contractor McDonnell Douglas
Corp. He was laid off by the company in 1987. That wasn't
long after he first complained to superiors about Northrop's
billing practices, according to Mr. Janssen's lawyer.
   In joining the suit, the government filed an amended
complaint that generally adopted Mr. Janssen's central
allegation that in 1985 Northrop developed but failed to
disclose a cost-saving manufacturing process for the F/A-18's
composite parts. By keeping the method secret, Justice
Department prosecutors and Mr. Janssen assert, the company
was able to pass on inflated expense estimates to the
government from 1985 through 1988.
   The Justice Department said it hasn't yet determined how
much money it would attempt to recover in the case. But Mr.
Janssen's attorney, William Ramsey, put the damages at about
$25 million.
   For a time, the Justice Department also considered
pressing criminal charges against Northrop for its work on
the F/A18, dubbed the Hornet. But a grand jury investigation
was dropped, according to several sources, as part of a
pre-trial settlement last month between the U.S. Attorney's
office here and Northrop on an unrelated test-falsification
case.
   Mr. Janssen's original suit, which is only one of several
False Claims Act cases pending against Northrop on various
projects, also named St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas. But
the government, in assuming a lead role in the case, decided
only to go after Northrop. Mr. Ramsey said in an interview
that he agreed with the Justice Department's decision because
it has become clear that McDonnell Douglas was totally
unaware of the manufacturing advance Northrop had devised.
   In fact, Mr. Ramsey maintained, the Northrop division in
Ventura, Calif., that came up with the invention didn't even
pass it on to its sister division that shared part of the
F/A-18 accord.
   The innovation, an improvement on what is known as the
"rubber bag" process, purportedly made it much easier to form
composite materials into complex shapes. By using reusable
silicon rubber vacuum bags that were much better than
earlier, more rudimentary models, Northrop allegedly was able
to shape and cure the parts for the F/A-18 with less material
and labor.
   "Essentially this is a technology that belonged to the
United States that was patented under Northrop's name," said
Mr. Ramsey, adding that his client will continue to pursue
the patent angle on his own, even though the government has
decided to limit the scope of the False Claims Act case to
the charges of overbilling.
   Under the False Claims Act, private citizens file lawsuits
alleging fraud against the government. The Justice Department
has the right to take control of such cases, but the private
plaintiff collects as much as 25% of any award recovered.
   With sales of $629 million last year, the F/A-18 is
Northrop's second-biggest program, after the B-2 Stealth
bomber.

   World Markets:
   Tokyo Shares End Lower in Moderate Trading
   As Profit-Taking, Index Arbitrage Erase Gains

   The widely monitored Nikkei average of Japanese share
prices finished lower in moderate trading yesterday, as
index-linked selling and profit-taking during the afternoon
session in Tokyo absorbed earlier gains, traders said.
   Despite the losses on the Nikkei index, however, rising
issues managed to outnumber decliners.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The index of 225 selected issues fell 184.40 points to
close at 29440.28.
   In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index was
down 50.55 points to 29389.73.
   Following Tuesday's 773.25-point loss, the Nikkei rose
more than 300 points on bargain hunting in yesterday's
morning session, hovering around the 30000 level through the
session. Prices of many stocks turned downward in the
afternoon, however, as stock-index futures began to decline,
reflecting investors' uncertainty about the yen's direction,
traders said.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 500 million
shares, down from 566 million shares Tuesday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered losers 515 to 418, while 157
issues remained unchanged.
   Gainers were spread over selected sectors, such as
pharmaceuticals, electrical parts makers and textiles.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which lost 43.03 points Tuesday, was down 0.94
point to close at 2185.30.
   The second section index, which gained 21.73 points
Tuesday, was up 13.66 points, or 0.39%, to close at 3533.62.
Volume in the second section was estimated at nine million
shares, the same as Tuesday's.
   Sentiment surrounding the yen's direction and its
stock-market implications remains somewhat nervous, said J.
Graham Biggart, head of futures and options at Schroder
Securities (Japan) Ltd. "But there has been quite reasonable
buying; I wouldn't get too worried at the moment."
   Observers said that traders also tried to hold the Nikkei
and Topix futures at high levels, but that buying there
couldn't be sustained because of weakened sentiments on the
yen's direction.
   Given the uncertainty on the yen, many investors have
turned to a defensive strategy: playing pharmaceuticals,
which move independently.
   "Drug stocks are shielded from both rising interest rates
and the weaker yen," said John Wilson, in charge of research
in pharmaceuticals and textiles at James Capel Pacific Ltd.
Mr. Wilson said that most pharmaceutical companies sell only
in a domestic market, disregarding the yen's exchange rate.
   Moreover, many of these companies are actually receiving
interest, so they benefit from higher interest rates, he
said.
   Because the stocks move independent of price trends, they
also are shielded from the economic slowdown that could
result from interest-rate conditions, Mr. Wilson said.
   He recommends the increasingly popular Sankyo and Chugai
Pharmaceutical, as well as Nippon Shinyaku.
   Chugai shares added 30 yen to 2,100 yen ($13.25), while
Sankyo slipped 10 yen to 2,600. Green Cross advanced 80 yen
to 1,830, Kaken Pharmaceutical gained 90 yen to 1,940 and Ono
Pharmaceutical surged 280 yen to 5,750.
   High-tech electricals were mixed, as Pioneer added 50 yen
to 6,200 and TDK grew 70 yen to 6,670, but Fanuc lost 80 yen
to 7,220 and Kyocera was down 60 yen to 7,660.
   Textiles, such as Kanebo, up 15 yen to 670 and Kurabo, up
41 yen to 750, were gainers.
   In Paris, French share prices climbed to a another record
on renewed demand from Japanese investors and market makers
in London.
   The CAC 40 Index jumped 27.72 points, or more than 1.3%,
to 2103.10, surpassing the market's previous record on Monday
of 2083.90. Trading was moderate, with the strongest demand
focused on blue chips. One broker noted the index is up
almost 10% since the end of March.
   Brokers said the session began on a lackluster note with
profit-taking sending the index down. The drop quickly
attracted interest from London market makers, who are thought
to be short some leading issues after the French market's
slump at the beginning of the year.
   Dealers also suggested Japanese investors are moving their
positions out of West Germany and into France, where the
possibility of a near-term interest-rate cut is higher as the
economy appears poised for long-lasting improvements and the
outlook for corporate profits is considered bright.
   Holding company Cerus was among the day's top gainers,
jumping 19.50 francs ($3.47) to 424.50 francs ($75.45) in
active trading. One trader noted that there had been
unconfirmed newspaper reports Cerus, headed by Italian
financier Carlo De Benedetti, might be close to selling its
15% stake in Societe Generale de Belgique.
   Peugeot, which is scheduled to report its 1989 earnings
next week, continued its rise, adding 10 francs to close at
914. Tire group Michelin gained 6.10 francs to 144.90.
   Among leading blue chips, food group BSN rose four francs
to 842 and CGE climbed 10 to 629. Travel and leisure group
Club Med advanced 30 to 710 while LaFarge Coppee followed
through on its previous rally with a gain of 11.50 to 438.
   Oil issues were hit by profit-taking after substantial
gains earlier in the week. Elf Aquitaine eased 12 francs to
665 and Total CFP slipped nine francs to 667.
   In Frankfurt, West German share prices closed lower in
thin trading, as a modest rally early in the session was
snuffed out by a lack of follow-up orders.
   The German Stock Index dropped 4.74 points to end at
1893.77, the sixth consecutive decline. The DAX had moved as
high as 1907.89 early in the day before trailing off.
   The major blue-chip shares declined with the market.
Daimler-Benz edged four marks lower to 917 marks ($547.30),
Deutsche Bank dropped 3.50 marks to 784.50 marks and Siemens
eased 2.40 marks to 770.10.
   In the electrical sector, Nixdorf shares shot up 4.50
marks to 357.50 following news Tuesday that the Federal
Cartel Office in Bonn said it wouldn't block the proposed
merger with Siemens. AEG dropped six marks to 316.
   London shares closed mixed after a session described by
dealers as "desperately quiet" ahead of the extended Easter
holiday weekend.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
two points lower at 2215.5, a touch higher than its intraday
low of 2211.9 reached around midafternoon. The index hit an
intraday high of 2219.9 just after official trading began.
   Meanwhile, the narrower 30-share index ended up 0.8 point
at 1733.3. Volume was 311.7 million shares, compared with
turnover of 367.6 million Tuesday.
   Dealers said the market's attention will be turned today
to the release of British retail price index data for March.
   Elsewhere in Europe, share prices ended lower in Zurich,
Stockholm and Milan, and were mixed in Brussels and
Amsterdam.
   In Asian and Pacific markets, shares closed lower in
Sydney and Wellington and were higher in Manila, Singapore,
Hong Kong, Taipei and Seoul.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,

   ENSR Corp. said it agreed to a $125 million acquisition
offer from a unit of a German company.
   ENSR, Houston, said its directors approved an offer of
$8.25 a share for all 9.6 million ENSR shares from American
NuKEM Corp., a U.S. subsidiary of NuKEM G.m.b.H., a German
holding company. The proposal also calls for NuKEM to assume
some ENSR debt, and is subject to NuKEM's acquiring 66.67% of
the shares outstanding. ENSR said a tender offer will begin
within five business days.

   In American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, ENSR surged
$2.125 to $8.
   ENSR provides environmental consulting services and
hazardous waste remediation. The company had 1989 revenue of
$158 million. American NuKEM, based in New Jersey,
specializes in incineration and waste treatment. It had 1989
revenue of $49.6 million. The majority owner of its parent,
NuKEM G.m.b.H., is Rheinisch Westfaelisches
Elektrizitaetswerk AG, the largest utility in Germany. The
other two holders of NuKEM G.m.b.H. are Degussa AG and
Metallgesellschaft AG.
   Bert Wollen, ENSR interim chief executive officer, said
the two companies have almost no duplication of services, and
complement each other geographically.
