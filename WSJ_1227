   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- More than 600 state employees were to
put in their last day of work yesterday as the Cuomo
administration went ahead with layoff plans to help eliminate
an estimated $1 billion deficit in the state's $50 billion
budget.
   Included among the 619 employees to be fired were about
300 prison guards and 300 other prison workers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   James Flateau, Gov. Mario Cuomo's spokesman on criminal
justice issues, said yesterday that no problems had been
reported at the prisons because of layoffs.
   On Christmas Eve, the leadership of Council 82, the prison
guards' union, met with Corrections Commissioner Thomas
Coughlin to discuss the layoffs amid speculation that guards
were considering a strike or some other protest.
   Union President Thomas Kennedy said no strike had been
called.
   While he was reluctant to talk about union sentiment
regarding some form of protest to the guard layoffs and other
cost-cutting actions, he warned that anxiety among guards was
running high. He called for intervention by Mr. Cuomo.
   "The last time we saw this type of dissatisfaction. . . .,
there was a strike in 1979," Mr. Kennedy said.
   At that time, then-Gov. Hugh Carey called the National
Guard to run the prisons during a 16-day strike by prison
guards upset over negotiations for a new contract.
   "We've done everything possible to avert these layoffs,
but nobody is listening at the (state) Capitol," Mr. Kennedy
said after the Monday meeting.
   Mr. Flateau said yesterday that Mr. Cuomo has been
involved in layoff discussions. "It's disingenuous to say the
governor has not been involved," Mr. Flateau said.
   Other state workers putting in their last day yesterday
included 12 employees at the state Division of Parole and
seven Commission on Correction employees.
   In all, 2,000 state workers are to be laid off by the end
of the fiscal year on March 31. Mr. Cuomo has promised to
eliminate 4,000 additional jobs through attrition and early
retirement incentives. Next year, the governor has said, he
may have to eliminate 12,000 more jobs.
   The state has more than 200,000 employees.
   Twenty-three more layoffs will take effect Jan. 2. Those
cuts are at the Division of Criminal Justice Services, the
Division of Military and Naval Affairs and the Department of
State, said a spokeswoman for the Governor's Office of
Employee Relations.

   No, a Jane Fonda Exercise Book
   Won't Really Ensure Our Survival

   The Pulitzer Prize for Fiction it isn't. But it does rival
the Nobel Prize for Literature.
   At least the monetary reward does -- $500,000. It's The
Turner (as in Ted) Tomorrow Award, to be given next June to a
work of fiction that's set in the near future (1991-2021) and
incorporates themes "ensuring the survival and prosperity of
all life on our planet."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But you better hurry up: The deadline is midnight Monday.
   Mr. Turner and his Turner Broadcasting System Inc. are
sponsoring the competition, which was announced in November
1989. But Selmer Bringsjord, an assistant professor of
philosophy at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and colleague
David Porush just got started writing their entry last month.
"We write very fast," says Mr. Bringsjord.
   Their novel, "The Second Coming," is about a band of
forgotten SETI (Search For Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)
pioneers sent out by the world to search for
extra-terrestrial life. They've returned to a dying Earth
with desperate solutions to the world's problems, says Prof.
Bringsjord.
   And why are these authors entering the contest? "The money
is staggering," he acknowledges. (The novel is taking some
time away from Mr. Bringsjord's real-life project: developing
a computer software program to write fiction for adults.)
   Mary Jane Batson, manager for Turner Publishing Inc., says
more than 1,000 manuscripts -- of 50,000 to 100,000 words
each -- have been submitted, and the New York processing
office is "inundated with bags and bags of mail." Turner has
mailed about 25,000 entry kits world-wide. "I do think we'll
go beyond 2,000," she says. But that would still be far below
the 10,000 to 15,000 entries originally projected.
   Besides the grand-prize winner, four $50,000 "merit"
prizes will be announced next June 3. Turner Publishing will
publish the books and promises to spend $50,000 apiece
promoting them. The authors get royalties, but Turner gets
film rights. Ms. Batson insists the competition wasn't
established as a moneymaking venture.
   The judges who will read the 30 to 40 finalists include
well-known authors Wallace Stegner, Ray Bradbury, William
Styron and Carlos Fuentes.
   And how does Prof. Bringsjord's band of adventurers
propose to solve the world's travails? Their message, he
says, is: "You're on your own, you're your own salvation,
cultivate your garden."

   Samsung Issue
   Is Seen Sparking
   Similar Offerings

<LP>
   The successful launch of Samsung Co.'s depositary receipts
is expected to usher in a period of low-priced overseas
issues by other South Korean companies.
   The receipts, which were priced two weeks ago at a 15%
premium to Samsung's shares, are trading at about a 19%
premium. Analysts attribute the success of the launch only
partly to the reputation of the company, which is the trading
arm of the diversified Samsung group. They say demand was
spurred largely by the receipts' low premium compared with
Korean issues in recent years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It marks a break with the pricing patterns of previous
Korean overseas issues," says Melissa Brown, senior analyst
with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd. in Seoul. "It
will have a serious impact on deals coming to market early
next year."
   The $40 million issue of depositary receipts was launched
in two portions of approximately equal size in the U.S. and
Europe. The receipts, which are listed on the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange, will give investors access to Samsung shares
after the Korean stock market's scheduled opening to foreign
investors in 1992.
   Investor interest in the issue was reflected in the active
trading of the receipts by market makers in London the first
week after the launch. Trading has since slackened.
   Peter Rigg, managing director of CS First Boston Inc.,
which shares lead management duties for the issue with
Korea's Dongyang Securities Co., says he was pleased by the
receipts' initial liquidity. "The issue was extremely well
received, as we expected," he says.
   Ms. Brown of Barclays de Zoete says investors were cheered
when the premium came in at the lower end of the expected
range of 15% to 20%. "When the deal was finally launched,
there ended up being a little bit more demand than expected
because of the price," she says. "So there was a little more
trading after the launch."
   Some investors were unenthusiastic about the receipts even
at the modest price. William Ramsay, investment director of
Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd., says his company decided
against the receipts. "There are interesting companies to
invest in in Korea. Samsung Co. is not one of the them," he
says, making a distinction between Samsung Co., the trading
company, and other concerns in the Samsung group. "I believe
profit growth will be made elsewhere in the group."
   Analysts say the price of Samsung's receipts reflects a
recognition of the softened market for Korean overseas
issues. Because the Korean stock market is closed to foreign
investors, vehicles that provide access to shares -- such as
convertible bonds and mutual funds -- have traded at sky-high
premiums. For example, the Korea Fund, a mutual fund listed
on the New York Stock Exchange and investing solely in Korean
shares, was trading at a premium of more than 100% last year.
Now it is at about 15%.
   Investors' rejection of high premiums has ruined some
recent issues. For instance, Sunkyong Industries Co., the
last company to tap the overseas market, launched convertible
bonds in September at a 40% premium. Demand was so weak that
the underwriters were forced to swallow most of the issue.
   The lessons weren't lost on Samsung. "The (Samsung) issue
was priced at a level where there's demand in the market,"
says an analyst close to the transaction. "There is the
realization in Korea that that is what it takes -- that the
market has changed."
   Several issues that were delayed this year because of the
gloomy market are expected to try again in 1991, but their
prices are likely to reflect current conditions. "If they
think they can come back to the market and ask silly
premiums, they'll be disappointed again," says Mr. Ramsay of
Thornton Management.
   One overseas launch planned for next year is the $100
million Korea Asia Fund, the third mutual fund for
foreigners, which was postponed after a failed takeoff in
September. Other companies planning to try again to launch
overseas issues next year include Kolon Co., Tongyang Nylon
Co., and Jindo Co.

   Industry Slump May Surpass
   Losses of 1980-1982

</IN>
<LP>
   Among forest products companies, the 1980-1982 housing
slump is widely viewed as having produced the industry's
biggest losses since World War II.
   Soon, that slump may look like a romp in the woods.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consider:
   More sawmills have been closed in timber-rich Washington,
Idaho and Oregon so far this year than during any 12-month
period in the history of the industry, according to
consultant Paul F. Ehinger. Nearly 100 mills, or about one
for every four in the region, have been idled at some point
during the year. Many will never open again. That compares
with 54 mills lost during all of 1980-1982.
   Slack business has cut deeply into the industry's work
force. Some 8,450 workers have been laid off at some point
this year because of the mill closures, and permanent job
losses already are at 40% of losses seen in the previous
bust.
   Industry profits are sinking fast, with the top five
producers reporting an aggregate 46% decline in earnings for
the third quarter, and forecasting more bad news for the
fourth quarter. Further, analysts expect the cracks that are
showing up in the industry's foundations will widen next
year, and possibly beyond.
   "Collectively, there's more damage being done (to the
industry) than has ever been done before," said Mr. Ehinger,
a former president of the American Plywood Association.
"There's something about this slowdown that seems to drain
the vitality out of the whole system. It's hard to put into
words, but there is a difference."
   One difference is that companies are being hit from both
sides: high raw material prices, reflecting environmental
restrictions on logging, and plummeting prices from low
demand for building products, reflecting rapidly weakening
residential construction activity.
   Despite raw material shortages, prices of plywood and
other structural wood products have fallen 20% to 33% since
January. In real terms, prices still are above the level they
were in the 1980-1982 period, but perhaps not for long.
   Multifamily housing construction is at a post-war low, and
single-family home starts, while still above levels of the
early 1980s, are falling fast. Shopping mall, hotel and
office-building construction, depressed for three years,
shows no signs of a revival. Compounding the mess is a
growing credit crunch affecting developers, reflecting the
thrift debacle and evolving concerns about the health of the
nation's banking system.
   By contrast, in the last downturn from 1980-82, there were
exceptions in the economic drought. Some companies had large
work orders under contract, others survived by cutting prices
and making deals on short-term sales. Such flexibility no
longer exists, prompting widespread closings and other moves.
   Early this month, Bohemia Inc., a midsized wood products
concern based in Eugene, Ore., said its board approved a
restructuring that includes selling its California
operations, which accounted for about 24% of sales in the
latest fiscal year. The company, started in 1916, also said
it was considering closing some or all of its Oregon
operations.
   Pope &amp; Talbot Inc. recently reduced its work force at its
Port Gamble, Ore., mill by 44%, and reduced lumber production
there to 350,000 from 800,000 board feet per day. The mill
processed lumber primarily for the suddenly weak California
housing market, said Reed R. Trull, sales manager at the
mill. "We're going through a liquidity crunch that could put
us in worse shape than we saw in 1981-1982," said Mr. Trull.
   Pope &amp; Talbot Inc. said weak lumber markets caused by the
construction recession would result in "near break-even"
fourth-quarter earnings for the Portland, Ore., wood products
company. The company earned 84 cents a share for 1989's
fourth quarter and posted earnings of 30 cents a share for
the third quarter.
   The biggest players also are being affected.
Louisiana-Pacific Corp. said it expected flat fourth-quarter
earnings as it closed all of its 22 operations in California
for the Thanksgiving week, an unprecedented closure. The
projection surprised analysts who had been anticipating
earnings increases. Weyerhaeuser Corp. recently reduced its
work force by 290 employees, or about 50%, at a big mill in
Springfield, Ore.
   For owners of small logging concerns and their workers,
time and patience are at an even lower ebb.
   "Rose Logging has work until about the second week in
January and that's it," says Duane Grange, office manager for
Rose Logging Inc., based in Springfield. He says the company
currently has 21 people working two logging sites; that
compares with 104 people on 14 or 15 sites in midsummer.
"You're either out of business or you're shut down hoping the
spring will bring work."
   And the spring doesn't look good.
   "Springtime is the traditional start of the season and an
increased demand," said Sherman Chao, an analyst at Salomon
Inc. But "it didn't happen this year and I don't expect it
will happen next year," he said. He is predicting a 20%
decline in industry profits for 1991.
   "Making a forecast for the housing sector assumes that the
money for building will be there," Mr. Chao said, "but until
the financial sector is on solid ground, it is difficult to
even discuss the return of the housing industry."
   Certainly, many furloughed workers aren't waiting for a
turnaround. Loggers and millworkers are entering federal job
retraining programs at colleges and universities around the
region. At the Oregon Office of Economic Development, state
officials are looking to create such jobs as cabinet and
furniture makers in the secondary markets as primary wood
jobs are lost.
   Jon E. Fair spent 21 years working in mills in Washington
and at the Pope &amp; Talbot sawmill in his hometown, Oak Ridge,
Ore. "From the time I got out of high school I worked at the
mill," said the 40-year-old Mr. Fair. "Everything I did was
to further myself in the woods industry, but not anymore." He
was laid off in July 1989.
   Today, he studies aviation mechanics at Lane Community
College in Eugene, and runs into former co-workers in the
campus cafeteria. He says there are people in Oak Ridge who
believe the traditional logging economy will return, but he
thinks those days are gone. "I'll have to leave Oak Ridge and
head for San Diego, New Mexico or maybe even Texas or
Florida," said Mr. Fair.

   "The Godfather Part III" has been constructed as a formal
ceremony, a reverential homage to its predecessors. The
picture's elegiac mood, its rigorous adherence to the
dictates of pomp and circumstance, make the entire enterprise
seem not so much a movie as a religious service.
Unfortunately, like many religious ceremonies, the content of
this one falls far short of the somber beauty of its physical
surroundings.
   The first two movies in the "Godfather" series deservedly
hold a special place in Hollywood film history. The pictures
potently combined and altered two mainstays of popular
American culture -- the gangster film and the family
melodrama. The director Francis Ford Coppola found in these
stories of the evolution of the Corleone clan the perfect
outlet for his emotional, operatic sensibility. He presented
the Corleone saga as the darkest side of the classic American
success story; the successful immigrants who made good by
doing evil.

<TEXT>
   Now, 16 years after "The Godfather Part II," Mr. Coppola
has tried to complete the story with a Shakespearian
flourish. Michael Corleone, the idealistic child of the Mafia
who ultimately became more ruthless than his father, is a man
in his 60s. He's spent the past several years trying to
reconstruct himself as a good man, to leave behind a false,
noble legacy to his children. He's divorced himself from the
underworld and has channeled his money into legitimate
businesses and charities. But he can't escape his past; the
film makers punish him for his sins with stern Old Testament
justice.
   This scenario, devised by Mr. Coppola and his
co-screenwriter, Mario Puzo, is exactly the right way to
conclude the Corleone legend. And Al Pacino's haunted
portrayal of Michael Corleone's confrontation with his past
bristles with a raw honesty. He is a tragic figure; a great
man who devoted his passion and energy to evil and hypocrisy.
Looking haggard and tired, Mr. Pacino brings a powerful,
quiet despair to this portrayal of a wicked person whose
conscience has been reawakened by closer proximity to death.
   Unfortunately, the script betrays its idea and Mr.
Pacino's performance with weak dialogue and ill-conceived
scenes that either play too long or shouldn't have played at
all. The picture feels bloated. Mr. Coppola lays out a series
of lushly conceived settings whose richness only accentuates
the hollowness of the words and actions that take place in
them.
   The beauty of "Godfather II" lay in its originality. It
was a continuation of "The Godfather," but also a textured
movie all on its own. This new "Godfather," however, has all
the weaknesses of the typical sequel. The characters
frequently seem to be explaining what they're doing -- and
how what they're doing relates to the past. Characters from
the earlier movies show up to lecture Michael or to haunt
him. The occasional new and interesting character -- Bridget
Fonda as a reporter, Joe Mantegna as a publicity-hungry
mobster -- are dispensed with all too quickly.
   The "Godfather" series has been particularly compelling
because of the connecting dramas between the Corleone family
and the other family, the Mafia. By the time Part III begins,
the Corleone line has been severed because Michael's own son
has disowned him. So the film makers brought in the
illegitimate son of Sonny, Michael's dead brother, to serve
as heir to the throne. As Vincent the bristly charmer, Andy
Garcia injects some much-needed energy into the mix. However,
even his part is diminished by the script, and more
critically, by a sad casting error.
   Winona Ryder, the young actress who was supposed to play
Michael's daughter Mary, dropped out of the movie and was
replaced by Mr. Coppola's own daughter, Sofia Coppola. This
substitution has a disastrous effect on a crucial moment in
the film's final tragedy, which turns on Michael Corleone's
disapproval of the romance between Mary and Vincent, her
first cousin.
   Ms. Coppola's awkwardness and lack of conventional beauty
might have come off as a bit of charming realism if she were
a gifted actress, or even a competent one. Unfortunately, she
is so uncertain and clumsy that it is impossible to believe
for an instant that a slick operator like Vincent would even
notice her, much less be infatuated with her. When Ms.
Coppola looks at Michael Corleone and says, "Dad, how could
you do this to me?" the line takes on an unintended note of
comedy.
   The picture is, nonetheless, an ambitious undertaking.
Messrs. Coppola and Puzo reshape the Banco Ambrosiano scandal
to forge a link between the Corleone family and the Vatican
in scenes that are satisfactorily portentous. But too often
"Godfather III" is labored and tedious and preachy, like an
old man boring the relatives at a holiday gathering with his
falsified version of his life story.
   ---
   After that endlessly sobering experience, it's a pleasure
to indulge in a smart little piece of froth like Woody
Allen's "Alice." The picture's subject matter doesn't sound
like much fun: midlife crisis, adultery, guilt and the moral
erosion brought on by great wealth. But Mr. Allen has
maneuvered through all these things by means of one of the
more likably nondescript movie heroines to come along in a
while.
   Mia Farrow pulls off a marvelous comic turn as Alice, a
rich man's wife who's thoroughly bored and ashamed of her
dull, pampered life. Mr. Allen's sly portrayal of the very
rich in New York is amusing, as is Alice's loopy journey to
self-awareness.
   ---
   VIDEO TIP: All the "Godfather" freaks out there have
probably already prepared for Part III by watching either the
separate or the combined versions of the first two chapters.
To complete the picture, take a look at "The Freshman" when
it comes out on video a month or two from now. Marlon
Brando's self-parody of his Don Corleone is priceless.

   U.S. Troops Replace Building Boom
   As Source of Profit for Saudi Businesses

   DAMMAM, Saudi Arabia -- For air-conditioner salesmen along
the Persian Gulf, August normally is the cruelest month.
Despite the heat, there's no business because summer is
almost over.
   This past August was different. The U.S. military swooped
in, needing machines to cool acres of tents. Then some
250,000 Kuwaitis arrived, many seeking temporary quarters
that had to be air conditioned. Finally, the trade embargo
shut down competitors in Iraq and Kuwait. Saudi merchants
such as Ahmad Al-Zamil, who owns a group of air-conditioner
companies with his 11 brothers, couldn't be happier. Building
contractors and vendors of other products who are cashing in
on the crisis feel the exact same way.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We were always ready for this," says Mr. Al-Zamil.
   The Saudi government estimates that local merchants are
providing $1.2 billion a month worth of "host nation support"
for U.S. and allied troops in the Gulf. The business comes as
a huge relief to the merchants, who had just seen the end of
the multibillion dollar building boom of the 1980s that
transformed Saudi cities from desert towns to places that now
resemble chunks of Los Angeles. They now faced empty
construction camps, fleets of unused trucks, vacant port
facilities and lots of "excess capacity" in plants like
Al-Zamil Refrigeration Industries.
   According to Maj. Gen. Gus Pagonis, head of the U.S.
logistics operation here, the sharp slump in the Saudi
building boom was a key factor in President Bush's hasty
decision to send in combat units without combat supplies in
August. "We knew the bases, the ports, the flatbeds (trucks)
were here," he says. "They've overbuilt, so then the question
is what do you send in first? You send in the troops."
   Unlike Korea and Vietnam, the Americans were landing in a
country where the host had a big checkbook. Gen. Pagonis and
his team of contracting officers needed contractors who could
provide large quantities of food, water, fuel, transportation
and leases for bases. They appeared and the Saudis paid them.
   Within a few days, a huge fleet of flatbed trucks that
once carried bulldozers to construction sites was on the
freeways carrying U.S. tanks to the front. "If they didn't
get help from Saudi Arabia, they'd still be sitting with
their supplies on the beach," says Abdul Rahim Al-Rashed,
director of a local building supply company, which happened
to have a nearly empty construction camp complete with
barracks and kitchens for 4,000 workers.
   The Al-Rashed camp, which was last used to build a modern
sewer system for Dammam, is now "Superleg City," the main
U.S. logistics operation. The building where concrete pipes
were made is now the home of the Army's M-1945 portable
bakery that pumps out 2,000 loaves of white bread and raisin
bread a day.
   The former building supply storage area now features Sgt.
Steven Price's laundry, which is struggling to provide a
weekly fresh change of clothes for the troopers of the 82nd
Airborne Division. "If a soldier out there is going to be
dirty and stink, his morale isn't going to be worth nothing,"
observes Sgt. Price.
   A. Salman Almatrood knows about dirty troops. Back in the
late 1940s, when U.S. airmen converted a nearby airfield into
a strategic bomber base, he was one of the 12-year-old Saudi
boys who used to scramble for their business. He'd wash their
uniforms in an aluminum tub.
   Now he owns a gleaming new laundry, built just down the
road. He has plenty of excess capacity, but, so far, other
competitors for the dusty uniform business have underbid him.
Noting that there are 150,000 more troops on the way, he says
he is content to wait: "I know one thing, there is not going
to be enough capacity to do laundry for the whole Army."
   The first American troops arriving outran both the Saudi
and the U.S. support systems. Capt. Lou Boone of the 82nd
Airborne recalls one of his first Saudi meals. It was a sack
with two burgers, large french fries and an apple pie
garnered by supply sergeants from a local Hardee's. (The
Saudis, according to Gen. Pagonis, have since reimbursed the
U.S. Treasury for $680 million worth of initial supplies the
U.S. purchased before local support kicked in.)
   Ragi Abouhaidar, regional director for the Saudi Catering
and Contracting Co., remembers the first Air Force crews to
arrive. "It was very difficult because they wanted everything
and they had nothing and everything they had to have was
needed on the same day," he says.
   Saudi Catering, whose cooks fed Korean, Indian, Pakistani
and Thai laborers at 120 locations all over Saudi Arabia,
swung into action. The company, which is owned by an uncle of
King Fahd, managed by Lebanese, and operated by a small
United Nations of 4,000 employees, is still scrambling,
importing chicken from France, lamb from New Zealand and
hamburger makings from the U.S.
   Saudi money, and Napoleon's maxim that an army marches on
its stomach, is what drives Saudi Catering on. "Can you
imagine," asks Mr. Abouhaidar, "if we went to the troops and
said, `I'm sorry, we can't feed you today, gentlemen'?"

   The first time V.S. Naipaul went to India, in 1962, he was
just 30 years old, a writer not yet famous, not yet
financially secure.
   His trip resulted in "An Area of Darkness," a dazzling
travel book of acute observation and sharp-edged comment,
colored by the shock and disappointment that the
Trinidad-born writer felt in the country of his ancestors. In
a nation that many Westerners and even greater numbers of
privileged Indians believed possessed of a spiritual light
deserving respect from less-enlightened parts of the world,
Mr. Naipaul found darkness. The book outraged those devotees
of the cult of India's spiritual superiority -- all the more
so because it awakened others to the prevalence of cant and
cruelty in the land of Gandhi and Nehru. The enormous impact
of "An Area of Darkness" greatly enhanced Mr. Naipaul's
reputation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That first encounter was much in Mr. Naipaul's thoughts
when he set out in 1988 on another long visit to India. His
timing was good because since independence in 1947 India has
never been so prosperous, nor so troubled. On the one hand,
India has left behind its early beggarly dependence and
created a large middle class that, in turn, is the engine of
a consumer-spending boom. On the other, violence is rising
from Kashmir to Assam and only the Soviet Union faces more
separatist challenges to central government control.
   It seems a perfect moment for Mr. Naipaul's latest report.
But, "India: A Million Mutinies Now" (Viking, 521 pages,
$24.95) disappoints. Mr. Naipaul is no longer a young writer
on a tight budget. He stays in the best hotels and travels
with hired car and driver. Something also has changed in Mr.
Naipaul's nonfiction.
   His new book on India follows "A Turn in the South," his
unoriginal, shallow look at the southern U.S. Mr. Naipaul now
seems uninclined to edit his material or allow others to do
so. As a result, the distinguished writer crams "India" with
overlong portraits of one Indian after another -- some
interesting, some not. Often he includes his questions as
well as the answers as though every word were important. At
its worst, "India" is like reading the transcripts of Bill
Moyers dialogues -- including the outtakes. It is earnest,
respectful, high-minded, but to no purpose.
   For almost four-fifths of this lengthy book, Mr. Naipaul
is content to keep his tape recorder running while his mind
idles. Once in a while he slips it into gear and, as one
would expect, out pops an arresting insight. But as he
travels through Bombay, Goa, Tamil Nadu and Calcutta he seems
determined not to explain what he thinks all his interviews
add up to.
   It's an old joke in journalism to hand an editor an
overlong story with the explanation: "I'm sorry, I didn't
have time to write it short." The point is that to write
short you have to know what your story is about. To write
clearly, you have to know what you think. For hundreds of
pages, Mr. Naipaul tempts the reader to conclude that he no
longer knows what he thinks about India.
   A murmur of apology runs through "India." The shock and
humiliation that the young Naipaul felt upon first
encountering the land that had long been so important in his
imagination has given way to a mellower view in the mind of
the middle-aged man. His youthful attitude he now calls "old
nerves" and seems to reproach himself for having been in 1962
"a fearful traveller." His disappointment, he writes now,
resulted from his having naively cherished "the idea of the
family of India." Indians didn't share such an illusion, he
knows now. The idea of an all-inclusive fellowship of man is
mocked daily in Indian life by caste, clan and religious
clashes.
   Today, Mr. Naipaul argues that the last 90 years of
British rule (after the mutiny) and the 40-plus years of
India's independence have been a time of regeneration in
which the idea of freedom has reached all Indians, bringing
self-awareness and strength.
   At last, when Mr. Naipaul reaches Lucknow, the Punjab and
Kashmir in the final sections of his book, he slips his mind
into gear and writes with some of the provocative keenness of
vision found in his earlier works. But his analysis leads him
to a dubiously wishful conclusion.
   Although separatist tendencies make headlines today, and
although India may not be the family of his youthful dreams,
he argues it has become a nation. The million little mutinies
of his subtitle are not cause for great alarm, only symptoms
of the rage that accompanies a liberation of the spirit, he
writes in words that would have saved him so many brickbats
had he written them in 1962. "The Indian Union was greater
than the sum of its parts; and many of these movements of
excess strengthened the Indian state, defining it as the
source of law and civility and reasonableness," he adds.
   The mutinies, like those in which Moslems and Hindus kill
each other in Kashmir or Sikhs and Hindus kill each other in
Punjab, are seen as a positive phenomenon: "They were part of
the beginning of a new way for many millions, part of India's
growth, part of its restoration."
   It would be nice to think Mr. Naipaul is right.

   The nation's merchants, spooked by the ghost of the bleak
Christmas just past, are bracing for tough times in the first
half of 1991.
   For bargain hunters, that is likely to mean a bonanza.
"We'll be more aggressive" in promoting special deals, vows
William McCarthy, president of marketing at Montgomery Ward &amp;
Co. in Chicago. Troubled Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. also is
planning to tout more deals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But some retail executives fear that, in the current
recessionary climate, even big price cuts won't coax
consumers to open their wallets. Just listen to Cari
Brookbanks, an advertising account supervisor in Chicago.
"I'm going to stay out of the stores," she declares, citing a
joint decision with her adman husband "to tighten our belts a
little bit."
   Says Linnette Peterson, a receptionist from Staten Island,
N.Y.: "I sure don't plan to get anywhere near the stores for
the January sales."
   Indeed, the retail slump shows no signs of abating after a
Christmas season that, by most accounts, finished on a blue
note. Despite widespread discounting, holiday sales slipped
below last year's at some stores while others barely exceeded
last year's receipts, industry executives say. After
adjusting for inflation, the final tallies for the crucial
holiday period are expected to be the worst in many years.
   The outlook for the first half of 1991 is even grimmer.
Consultant Walter Loeb predicts that same-store sales in the
first half of the year will decline as much as 4%, further
squeezing industry profits.
   "If the consumer wasn't shopping for Santa Claus and
Christmas, I can't imagine why they would shop in the first
half of the year," says Dayton Hudson Corp. Chairman Kenneth
Macke.
   "This is a difficult economic climate, and it makes
running the business a lot tougher," says Julian Taub, a
senior vice president at Campeau Corp.'s Bloomingdale's,
where holiday revenue was "within a percentage point or two
of last year."
   Predicts Jack McMillan, president of Nordstrom Inc.: "It's
going to be a tough first half."
   The wild card is the Persian Gulf crisis. The current
standoff undoubtedly depressed shoppers and contributed to
the slump in holiday sales. But "if war breaks out in the
Middle East, it could be catastrophic," says Arthur Martinez,
vice chairman of Investcorp International Inc.'s Saks Fifth
Avenue, which matched last year's holiday sales on a
same-store basis. "On the other hand, if the dispute is
favorably resolved, it could provide a psychological boost."
   In any case, most merchants are shrinking inventories,
cutting staff and expenses and planning to promote the sorts
of basic apparel and household products that typically sell
best in a recession.
   At K mart Corp., which registered a slight increase in
holiday sales, a spokesman says the discount chain is
"placing greater emphasis" on low-priced commodities such as
toothpaste, paper products and household cleaners, and
focusing less on more expensive televisions and stereo
equipment. "We're trying to put our inventories where we
think it will do us the most good," he says.
   The Christmas season provided ample evidence that
consumers, fearing a recession and a war, are trading down to
lower-priced goods and delaying discretionary purchases.
   At Bill's London Transit, a small men's store in Atlanta,
manager Philip M. Griffiths says shoppers tended to choose
$45 sweaters instead of $1,200 leather suits. Jerry Sheff,
owner of The Jewelry Store in Boston, says "customers stayed
away from anything costing $100 or more as if it were a
pickpocket." At FrontRunners Inc., a Los Angeles active
apparel retailer, owner Paul D. Tordella says he sold out of
T-shirts for the first time this December and socks were a
popular gift, even in the affluent neighborhood of Brentwood.
   Tiffany &amp; Co., while reporting a modest but lower than
expected sales increase at U.S. stores, says "the average
customer purchase declined somewhat." And a hot seller at the
Card Factory in Los Angeles was a new $55 model of the
Filofax datebook. Last year's big gift was a $99 Mont Blanc
pen, now priced at $115 and hardly moving.
   Designs Inc., a Boston-based chain carrying only basic
Levi Strauss &amp; Co. sportswear, posted a 23% increase in
same-store sales for the holiday period. "It could be an
indication that, these days, people are looking for the more
basic, steadfast product," says Samuel Levenson, assistant to
the company treasurer. The chain also discounted
aggressively.
   Some merchants blame the media for poisoning the Christmas
mood. "People have the money," insists Ami A. Peretz, who
owns the Vencci men's boutique in Los Angeles. "They're just
choosing not to spend it because the news caused people to be
concerned about the gift budget. By January or February, I
hope people will get a clearer picture of what's happening in
the world and start buying again."
   But consumers were singing a different tune. "This is a
scary, unpredictable time," says Kelly S. Fiand, a college
student and Los Angeles waitress who slashed her Christmas
budget to $200 from last year's $1,000. "People are worried
about the economy and war. . . . Customers just aren't
tipping the way they used to."
   Says Ms. Peterson, the Staten Island receptionist who
intends to stay out of the stores: "I'm kind of worried about
next year, since it's been downhill all the way on Wall
Street with so many folks getting laid off."
   Indeed, most retail industry executives have lowered their
expectations and changed their definition of success. "For a
while, if you weren't getting double-digit increases just by
opening the door, you weren't satisfied," says Robert M.
Benham, president of Hallmark Cards Inc.'s Halls and Swansons
department stores in Kansas City. "Now, I think it's
remarkable that most of us are running even, instead of off
10%. The whole perspective has changed."

   PHILADELPHIA -- Presbyterian Ministers' Fund, which bills
itself as the world's oldest life insurance company and the
oldest continuously operated corporation in the U.S.,
observed its 273 years by changing its name to Covenant Life
Insurance Co.
   The company started in 1717 as a relief fund for
Presbyterian ministers and their families who were having
financial difficulties.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Presbyterian, incorporated since 1759, said the name
Covenant better reflects the diversity of its clientele,
which now includes clergy of many denominations, including
Baptists and Methodists.
   "People wouldn't understand that the company wasn't just
for Presbyterians," said a spokeswoman. "We did a lot of
biblical research to come up with a name that was more
friendly to our customers in the religious community."
   The company has offices in 40 states, $471 million in
total assets and more than $2 billion of insurance in force.

   The Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles is booked for a New
Year's Eve dinner costing $180 a person, up from $175 a year
ago. "As good as last year," it says of the reservations.
Chicago's Crowne Plaza Hotel does better than last year, when
some accommodations went begging. This year it sold out a
package costing $179.91 a couple that includes an overnight
room, dinner and open bar. Tatou, a New York supper club that
sells out a party costing $192 a person on the main floor and
$125 upstairs, thinks it could have done just as well at $50
more.

   But some hosts sense economic jitters. Roxbury, a Los
Angeles club that has sold out a dinner costing $75 each,
rejected a more elaborate offering, worrying a recession
"could have some impact on the way people are willing to
spend money." Pratos in Carlstadt, N.J., complains "economic
uncertainties are holding down business."
   Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel sees this as "a last chance
to celebrate, what with the uncertainty of 1991."
                                                                                                       

   MARKETING NIRVANA: Getting someone to pay to promote your
wares for you.
   With its first product, Gemstar Development Corp.,
Pasadena, Calif., seems to have found the path to every
drummer's fantasy. It is getting several dozen newspapers and
TV Guide to help create a market for Gemstar's VCR Plus+, a
hand-held remote device selling for $59.95 that lets viewers
easily set their home VCRs to tape any TV show. The
publications, including the Los Angeles Times and New York
Times, are running code numbers for each program that enable
VCR Plus+ to do its thing.
   Willard Colston, director of development at the Los
Angeles Times, says the paper pays Tribune Media Services "a
reasonable amount" to add the numbers to the TV listings that
the paper buys. And, for the exclusive use of the numbers in
its circulation area, the Times promises Gemstar to promote
VCR Plus+ for two years and then start paying a cash fee. For
its investment, says Mr. Colston, the Times gets a service it
hopes will keep readers happy and draw new subscribers.
"We're very pleased," Mr. Colston declares. And so, too, is
Gemstar. Louise Wannier, a vice president, says sales have
been running at an annual rate of more than three million
units, triple the company's original first-year goal.
                                                                                                       

   ROUGH WATERS: Recreational boating industry battens down
for squall.
   Unit sales of pleasure boats, which sank 15% in 1989, are
"off in excess of that in 1990," the National Marine
Manufacturers Association says. "People don't buy
discretionary durables when they don't feel good," a
spokesman explains, contending that consumers haven't had
much to feel good about lately, with the weak economy, tight
credit, the Persian Gulf crisis and, starting next Tuesday, a
10% luxury tax on the cost of new boats over $100,000.
Norwalk Yacht Sales in Connecticut confirms the tough sales
environment: "We do a lot more chasing" to find buyers, it
says.
   Brunswick Corp., which has been cutting production for two
years to bring inventories in line with sagging demand, saw
marine sales continue to drop in the third quarter, off 6%
from the 1989 pace. Still, says CEO Jack Reichert, "we're
doing OK; we made money." Also cutting production has been
Outboard Marine Corp., whose sales slumped 21% in the year
ended Sept. 30. But that's stronger than the industry's
performance, asserts CEO James Chapman. "We picked up market
share," he says.
   Exports are bright spots for many builders. They sell more
boats abroad than foreign makers sell here.
                                                                                                       

   UNMODEL BEHAVIOR: The Federal Trade Commission cracks down
on model agencies that allegedly entice substantial fees from
prospects but do little in return.
                                                                                                       

   ANOTHER SCAM: Citicorp Mortgage warns customers that some
"unauthorized companies" are telling borrowers to send
monthly checks to a new mortgage servicing firm that then
pockets the money.
                                                                                                       

   ONE-SHOT cost-cutting can cause more harm than good,
consultant Sibson &amp; Co. says, with a survey that shows most
companies instead properly direct their efforts to improving
customer service and management quality.
                                                                                                       

   IN SELLING, nice guys can finish last, product knowledge
isn't all that vital.
   What counts is trust, asserts Jack Snader, president of
Systema Corp., a Northbrook, Ill., consultant. "Don't
automatically teach `people-chemistry' skills. Don't spend
countless hours having your salespeople learn every technical
gizmo. Rather, ask customers how they want to be treated, and
do it that way," he says.
   Salespeople rated tops in technical proficiency by their
managers can be seen as technical incompetents by their
clients. Similarly, great personalities often are bested by
people with fewer social skills. But "over 200,000 customers
say they must be able to trust the salesperson to do what he
says he will do," he advises.
   There can be little trust, he says, if customers believe
sales reps are just trying to meet a quota.

   After Cornering Stock Market
   In Shanghai, the Investor
   Still Lives Like a Peasant

   SHANGHAI, China -- It is 2 p.m., and Yang Huaiding,
China's biggest stock player, is scheming. Known as
"Millions" Yang, he huddles with aides in the nerve center of
his financial empire -- a seedy coffee shop in a converted
movie-house balcony in Shanghai's former French quarter.
   It may not be the Trump Tower, but for mainland China the
trappings are impressive. A female assistant leans over his
shoulder and deferentially plops energy-giving ginseng root
into his tea. Other assistants report in by beeper calls as
their boss directs them in stock trades. Mr. Yang keeps extra
packs of Marlboros just to distribute to gangsters who come
nosing around to check him out.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "He's a real operator," says a Chinese economist, speaking
of Mr. Yang. "If he lived in Taiwan or Hong Kong, he would be
very, very rich." Shan Weijian, a professor of management at
the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, exclaims,
"He is incredible. He makes money from the government's
shortcomings while advocating change through financial
markets."
   Yet like Wall Street investors, Mr. Yang is encountering
harder times.
   Since the suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in
June 1989, this country's basic economic line has undergone
major revision -- from "To Get Rich Is Glorious," to
"Wholeheartedly Rely on the Working Class." Mr. Yang, a
working-class man who got rich, is now caught in the middle
between changing propaganda campaigns.
   In the 1990s, it seems, arbitragers are no more welcome in
China than they are on Wall Street. But the 40-year-old Mr.
Yang, an ardent believer in freer markets, is not giving up.
He declares, "We are planning a stock market revolution]" And
in fact, if he can last long enough, time may be on his side.
   Orthodox Marxists may try to twist China back to central
planning, but the long-term outlook doesn't look promising.
Some 60% of state industries already are in the red, the
government is going broke, and China's grizzled leaders are
too unpopular to bail the government out through their usual
practice of force-feeding state bonds to workers.
   As a result, some government bankers and economists say,
the government sooner or later may have to be rescued by
people like Mr. Yang -- no matter how ideologically out of
step they may be. "These kinds of players are absolutely
essential to give the markets liquidity, I keep telling the
government," says a Beijing economist with government
connections.
   But until capitalism makes a comeback, the story of how
Mr. Yang got the nickname "Baiwan," which means millions, and
cornered the Shanghai stock market, is a tale of how China's
reformist past is haunting its regressive present.
   In just over two years, Mr. Yang used his ninth-grade
education and trading tips from financial books to transform
himself from a $400-a-year steelworker into a savvy
securities trader who averages $100,000 a year in investment
gains.
   Not that being rich in China is much fun these days. At a
time when ostentation invites political peril, Mr. Yang, with
a thick mop of uncombed hair, several days' stubble on his
chin, and painfully bad teeth, prudently looks as if he had
never left the factory floor. Officially, he is unemployed.
He lives in a tiny apartment with his wife and five-year-old
son, wears worn-out polyester clothes and buys next to
nothing. He says he pours all of his profits back into the
market. For now anyway, authorities familiar with his
reputation choose to leave him alone.
   Essentially, Mr. Yang got rich the easy way: by
capitalizing on confusion as his country lurched toward
capitalism without any securities laws.
   The stage was set for Mr. Yang's success by Zhao Ziyang,
the reform-minded former premier and Chinese Communist Party
secretary-general who was deposed by conservatives after
troops mowed down pro-democracy demonstrators on June 4 last
year.
   In 1981, Mr. Zhao began issuing government treasury bills
to put the savings of China's masses to use in rebuilding the
country's tattered economy. He also encouraged local
governments and state-owned enterprises to start selling
stocks and bonds. Before long, the haphazardly regulated
experiment proved chaotic. By the time the government pulled
the plug on it in the spring of 1988, 61 cities had been
approved to start markets for bonds. And more than a
half-dozen cities had set up their own rudimentary stock
markets.
   Mr. Yang kept a close eye on this process. Born the year
after Mao Tse-tung's Communist guerrillas toppled Chiang
Kaishek's Kuomintang, he knew nothing but communism. But he
squirreled away his salary and looked for opportunities.
   He became a financial planner in the steel factory. He
studied translations of Western financial books. And so when
China backtracked on economic reforms in 1988, Mr. Yang found
opportunity staring him in the face.
   Out in the rural provinces, workers no longer wanted their
experimental bonds, many of which they had been forced by the
government to buy through payroll deductions. But in Mr.
Yang's native city of Shanghai, which had been the most
robust stock market in Asia before the revolution, more
sophisticated investors understood the interest-paying
coupons' value.
   In May 1988, Mr. Yang gathered his $8,000 savings. Every
other day, he hopped trains to the countryside. After buying
the bonds cheap from local banks, which were prohibited by
law from selling them across provincial borders, Mr. Yang
then brought them back to Shanghai, where investors eagerly
snapped them up.
   Each trip brought Mr. Yang a $5,000 profit -- quite a sum
in China, where per capita income averages about $350 a year.
But a couple of months later, the government lifted the ban
on banks' trading bonds with one another across provincial
borders, and Mr. Yang lost his edge.
   He then switched to stocks -- a market even more confused
than the bond market. In late 1989, the government gave a
green light to resurrect dormant stock exchanges in Shanghai
and Shenzhen, a special economic zone adjacent to Hong Kong.
   Shenzhen exploded in a frenzy of trading. The speculation
grew so unruly by July that the Chinese government
reconsidered its open-mindedness. It slapped restrictions on
the amount the market could rise or fall each day, and
imposed fines and jail terms on violators. Some 200
frustrated speculators jumped on planes and trains for the
only remaining active stock market in Shanghai. The market
here recently centralized its business (mostly a bond market)
in new quarters, one building in which to clear trades that
previously had been handled by trading counters around town
that kept in touch by phone.
   Mr. Yang was waiting for the speculators. He used his bond
earnings to corner shares on the tiny stock market, in which
only seven companies are listed. Although no official records
are available in China, economists here believe Mr. Yang
quickly bought up enough shares to control prices, which
soared. In early July, the Shanghai market's composite index,
called the Jingan Index, was hovering just above 100 points.
Shortly after the speculators arrived, it cracked 150.
   Trading got so heated that Mr. Yang went into hiding.
Every time he got near a securities house, crowds of
speculators would surround him. He took refuge in the
converted movie-house balcony.
   As the index neared 180 points on Aug. 13, the government
put its anti-capitalist foot down in Shanghai, too. It
imposed 3% up-or-down daily limits on all shares. It also
ordered that stocks traded outside the exchange be
confiscated.
   Now, Mr. Yang waits for the government to see the error of
its ways. It isn't an entirely unpleasant or unprofitable
wait. With a steady 3%-a-day upward march, the Jingan index
currently is at about 400 points. "I can just sit back and
watch my stocks go up," he concedes. Lately, however, he is
said nevertheless to be doing trading of some sort out of a
small room off a back alleyway. So he isn't just twiddling
his thumbs.
   Mr. Yang takes the long view. He has had business cards
printed with the title he gives himself, "Professional Stock
Investor," and this slogan: "Willing to be the stone that
paves the road for the development of China's stock and
securities industry. Learn from the courage of those who dare
to eat crab, and conduct risky personal investment."

   LANGREO, Spain -- Thanks to taxpayers in France, Germany
and the rest of Europe, towns all around here are getting a
big makeover.
   There's the new $10 million industrial park, for instance.
There is a bridge over the Nalon River, a series of new
roads, a $20 million garbage dump and even a new campsite.
It's all on Europe's tab.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The wellspring of this largess is the European Regional
Development Fund, a once little-known offshoot of the
European Community's plan to remove most internal trade
barriers by the end of 1992. To smooth out economic
differences among regions -- and get poorer members to agree
to the 1992 single market plan -- the EC doubled the fund's
budget to $68 billion over the next four years. The goal:
Improve lagging infrastructure, like that here in Spain's
Asturias region, to allow more businesses to create more jobs
in areas of chronic unemployment.
   But this money, now fully a quarter of the EC's central
budget, could be just the beginning. As the EC moves beyond
its 1992 program to a more encompassing plan for economic and
monetary union, poorer countries like Spain are demanding
that the development funds be doubled again, to a potentially
budget-busting $140 billion over four years.
   "The 1992 program and the economic and monetary union each
have two parts: the single market and social cohesion," says
Laureano Lazaro Araujo, a Spanish Economics Ministry
official. "If they want to go further, they're going to have
to pay" for the political cooperation of poorer countries
such as Spain.
   EC officials are beginning to acknowledge this fact. While
a recent EC Commission study on the likely impact of a single
European currency predicted more prosperity for everybody,
Bruce Millan, the commissioner in charge of regional policy,
said the effect "will be unequal across regions, even though
it will benefit the community as a whole." The gap between
rich and poor would widen, according to Mr. Millan, and
therefore more money would have to be spent in poorer areas.
   The huge scale of this transfer of wealth has caught the
eyes of the European Community's poorer neighbors. Hungary,
Poland and other Eastern European countries now want
desperately to join the EC, especially if they can also grab
some of the development dollars sloshing around. "From
Hungary we see the gap (in development) increasing between
members and nonmembers," says Ferenc Bartha, former head of
Hungary's central bank. "We want to know the steps and
conditions for us to join, so we can enjoy this aid before
the gap gets too big to ever close."
   Rich non-EC countries, meanwhile, aren't all that thrilled
with the development fund. Switzerland and Sweden, for
example, want closer ties to the European Community and even
contemplate joining one day. But so far they have hesitated,
partly because joining means shelling out huge contributions
to the regional development fund, which wouldn't much help
them. Some EC officials also concede the development projects
don't always live up to expectations and have, on occasion,
turned into an organizational mess.
   But in Spain the EC development funds are vital to a
country running full tilt to secure its place in Europe. The
isolation of the Franco years left Spain with obsolete
industries and never-developed regions. To help redress the
balance, the EC is giving Spain the single biggest percentage
-- 32.6% -- of the money spent in poor regions. Spain is also
getting a fifth of the money spent on redeveloping older
industrial regions (the ravaged north of the United Kingdom
will get 38% of this money).
   Even though the EC funds add up to less than 1% of Spain's
gross national product, they represent 5% to 10% of its
capital spending budget, and for a region like Asturias close
to 13% of all government investment. "This money lets us do
many things we'd never have done, and do the things we would
have had to do anyway, such as roads and sewers, in half the
time," says Vicente Sanchez Alvarez, economic counselor to
the regional government. "But the psychological effect is as
important as the money to convince people that we're not
alone with our future."
   A visit to Asturias shows they indeed aren't alone. Nearly
every highway and construction project is adorned with a sign
bearing the EC's blue and gold flag, signifying an EC
contribution. There's such a sign at the gates to the modern
new garbage dump under construction outside Oviedo, the
region's capital. Santiago Fernandez, an industrial engineer
in charge of garbage hereabouts, proudly shows off the narrow
wooded valley that within 25 years will be entirely filled
with treated refuse from miles around.
   One part of the valley floor is being carefully leveled by
bulldozers before two layers of heavy plastic, with
leak-detecting sensors in between, is laid down to receive
toxic industrial waste. In another part of the dump Mr.
Fernandez shows off a little house filled with computers that
monitor the production of methane gas from household garbage.
The gas powers a turbine and will soon generate enough
electricity for the dump and eventually for nearby homes and
businesses.
   Down the road, another EC billboard stands near the new
bridge over the river Nalon in the mining town of Langreo.
The bridge, and an adjacent new road, will finally end the
hour-long traffic jams that afflict downtown Langreo. They
are part of a broader plan to clean up the Nalon, which at
Langreo runs nearly as black as the coal dug from nearby
hills. "People here claim that 20 years ago there were fish
in this river," says Manuel Gomez, a road engineer. He thinks
that in another 10 years they might be back.
   "Since the coal industry declined, towns like Langreo
really have nothing," explains Belen Menendez Banuelos, a
local government official. "The road and the bridge is at
least something for them."
   Infrastructure improvements like this will also help lure
industry to the blighted area, or so the EC hopes. Jose Luis
San Miguel Cela, director of the Regional Development
Institute in Oviedo, says the region's 12 big companies and
2,000 small ones have long suffered from poor roads, aging
ports and inadequate railroads. Already, the EC projects,
along with local industrial incentives, have drawn investment
to the region from Du Pont Co. of the U.S., Thyssen AG of
Germany and others.
   However, Mr. San Miguel, a big booster of private
development, worries that the EC's efforts can be
counterproductive "if they lead to uncoordinated, slow
decisions on projects that have to be fitted into inflexible
programs decided on in Brussels, not Oviedo." Ideally, he
says, the EC money "will enable private industry to come here
and create real, lasting jobs."
   That's exactly what Jose Manual Perez Diaz is trying to do
at the new $10 million Valnalon industrial park in Langreo,
right next to an EC-funded project to rehabilitate the local
railway line. The project is a classic EC-type development:
It is taking the shell of the old steel mill, which was
founded in 1857 and closed in 1983, and turning it into a
complex for light manufacturing and service companies.
   In one of the building's shed-like workshops two men are
putting the finishing touches on a new, custom-built coal
mining tractor. Upstairs workmen are installing a dozen metal
screens that will house welding workbenches. Down the hall a
sophisticated factory automation training center is already
operating.
   But the Valnalon project also illustrates how costly such
development is: Even after pouring in a billion pesetas ($10
million) over the next few years, the site will employ at
most 2,000 people, less than half the 4,500 steelworkers who
toiled at the old mill at its peak. That's little comfort for
the 10,000 coal miners in Langreo, many of whom will probably
lose their jobs in coming years as more mines close.
   Still, Valnalon, like many EC projects, is a start, says
Mr. Perez. In addition to its other functions, the industrial
park will nurture -- partly through below-market rents -- a
number of small companies that otherwise might never have
been launched. And that, he says, can only benefit Langreo,
Spain -- and Europe.

   Commodities:
   Grain Futures Prices, After a String of Declines,
   Rally on Some Signs of Stability in Soviet Union

   CHICAGO -- After more than a week of price declines, grain
futures markets rallied on mildly encouraging news out of the
Soviet Union.
   Soybean futures led the rally, with a 4 3/4 cent increase
in the price of the March contract, which settled at $5.825 a
bushel. The corn contract for March delivery rose 1 3/4 cents
to $2.35 a bushel and the wheat contract for March delivery
rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.66 a bushel.

<TEXT>
   Some grain futures prices had dropped to new contract lows
Friday and Monday, largely in response to the resignation of
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and threats by
the head of the KGB that a crackdown might be necessary to
maintain order in the country. Traders worried that these
events might cause the Bush administration to balk at
granting the Soviets credit to buy U.S. grain.
   Yesterday, however, traders noted that the KGB had
softened its stance and the Soviet Congress had granted Prime
Minister Mikhail Gorbachev new powers, giving an indication
of some stability in the country. "It looked like Gorbachev
was at least still in charge," said Anne Frick, soybean
analyst for Prudential-Bache in New York. "I think that's
reassuring to the grain markets."
   The Bush administration has pledged to provide as much as
$1 billion in credits for food purchases by the
shortage-plagued Soviet Union and conceivably might grant
more credits early in the new year. Analysts say any retreat
to authoritarian rule in the Soviet Union might persuade the
U.S. to change its policy.
   Part of yesterday's rally was chalked up to a "technical
correction" after dramatic grain sell-offs last week.
Following six consecutive sessions of declines for soybean
futures, the market was due for a rally: "Price drops just
don't go forever with no correction," Ms. Frick said.
   Analysts said grain markets will be choppy and somewhat
aimless in the next few days, driven partly by continued news
out of the Soviet Union. Trading likely will be light through
the holiday season and leading up to Jan. 11, the day the
U.S. Agriculture Department will release a major crop report

   ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum product prices rose in
extremely light trading. On the New York Mercantile Exchange,
crude oil for February delivery ended at $27.22 a barrel, up
$1.30 from Friday. The Merc was closed Monday and Tuesday
because of the Christmas holiday. Yesterday's rise was
largely a catch-up response to action Monday on London's
International Petroleum Exchange, where Brent crudes rose
about $1 a barrel. Some aggressive war talk in the Middle
East contributed to yesterday's increase, as did technical
factors at the close of trading. Traders said heating oil
rose sharply, in part because cold weather finally hit the
East Coast. January heating oil finished at 81.26 cents a
gallon, up 2.32 cents. Gasoline rose in sympathy, with the
January contract up 1.90 cents to 68.14 cents a gallon.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose. February delivery
gold gained $3.10 an ounce to $387.40. March silver advanced
seven cents an ounce to $4.1580. April platinum edged up 20
cents an ounce to $412.40. Uncertainty in the Persian Gulf,
which boosted crude oil prices, continued to create support
for gold, analysts said. That uncertainty, and light demand
for the metal, is likely to hold February gold at about $380
and over, one analyst said.
                                                                                                       

   ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices advanced, with the March
contract rising 2.05 cents a pound to $1.1995. Some traders
bought contracts on reports that a surge of cold weather that
has moved into the Northwest part of the country may move
toward Florida more than a week from now, one analyst said.
The analyst added that the concerns were far-fetched, but
were stimulating demand anyway.

   NEW YORK -- Tiffany &amp; Co. said earnings estimates for its
fiscal fourth quarter are too high based on holiday sales
results, which rose but were below expectations.
   William R. Chaney, chairman of the jewelry retailer, said
U.S. sales were sufficiently below targeted increases to
justify a downward revision in estimates for the quarter
ending Jan. 31, 1991. Analysts' estimates had ranged from
per-share net income of $1.10 to $1.28. Mr. Chaney indicated
that profit could still reach approximately the level of the
year-earlier quarter, when Tiffany earned $15.9 million, or
$1.02 a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After yesterday's announcement, Tiffany fell $4.375 to
close at $37.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Tiffany said world-wide net sales rose 8% for the
eight-week period from Nov. 1 through Dec. 25, compared with
the year-earlier period. Mr. Chaney said sales in the U.S.
increased modestly but were below expectations, reflecting
consumer concern about the economy. However, international
retail sales growth continued to be strong. The company said
international retail sales rose 28%; U.S. retail sales rose
2%; and direct marketing sales rose 1%, based on preliminary
unaudited figures.
   Although some U.S. jewelry companies had been urging
customers to buy before the end of the year to avoid the
scheduled federal tax increase on luxury goods, a spokesman
said, "We didn't sense any impact on our holiday sales."
   Mr. Chaney said the company "will enjoy a record level of
sales and earnings in 1990. Although we are disappointed with
the results of the holiday period in the U.S., we recognize
that widespread economic concerns have affected consumer
spending at every level. We are encouraged, however, that the
number of customer purchases in Tiffany's U.S. stores
increased over the 1989 level, although the average customer
purchase declined somewhat. It demonstrated continued strong
customer loyalty."
   He said the company's strong financial position will
enable the company to aggressively pursue its expansion plans
in 1991. "While the current U.S. consumer spending slowdown
is, no doubt, affecting us, we believe our longer-term
opportunities are as bright as ever."
   The company expects to report results in early March.

   Fresh Bipartisan Effort to Be Sought
   To Close Big California Budget Gap

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California's huge and growing budget
deficit, the biggest ever for a state, is starting to
mobilize a Democratic-controlled legislature and a new
Republican governor -- and the result could well mean the
slaughter of some sacred cows.
   With spending churning out of control to an annual rate of
11% and revenue growth slowing to 5% a year in a softening
economy, legislative analyst Elizabeth Hill calculates that
California faces a budget gap of about $6 billion over the
next 18 months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The looming deficit caught many lawmakers here in the
state capital by surprise, as they adopted a budget in July
that had enough left over for a $1 billion reserve. Now, when
the legislators return next month, both they and Gov.-elect
Pete Wilson will be forced into hard choices that could
antagonize segments of the voting public.
   The choices boil down to raising taxes in a state where
the national tax revolt was born, hacking away at a budget
jealously guarded by special interests or doing some of both.
Lawmakers already are taking to party lines, with Democrats
favoring tax increases and Republicans supporting deeper
spending cuts. Democratic legislators have been at war with
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian for much of his eight-year
term.
   This deficit is so large, though, that the partisanship
seems to many to be softer than it has been in years. A
compromise combination of spending cuts and tax increases is
becoming widely expected, as well as a bipartisan attempt to
restructure fundamental problem areas in the budget.
   "If the state is going to survive this situation, there
will have to be real substantive reform, which means both the
Democrats and Republicans are going to have to take off their
partisan hats and put on their bipartisan hats," said Steven
A. Merksamer, a Sacramento lawyer and veteran political
observer.
   For their part, Democratic legislative leaders say they
are willing to work with Mr. Wilson, who has indicated he is
keeping mum about his budget plans until after he is
inaugurated Jan. 7.
   "The election of a new governor provides us the
opportunity for a fresh and constructive beginning, an
opportunity California cannot afford to ignore," John
Vasconcellos, Democratic chairman of the state Assembly's
Ways and Means Committee, said recently. "We're out of time.
Something has to give."
   Lawmakers are limited in how much they can cut. As much as
half of the budget is protected by state statute, and many
other programs have to grow just to keep up with California's
population, which stands at 29.5 million and is growing at
about 800,000 a year.
   The population pressure, for instance, is helping to push
up the number of prison inmates at an annual average of
13.6%, prompting the Department of Corrections budget to rise
an average of 16%. Debt service on state general obligation
bonds to fund new prisons and other projects is growing at
16.4% a year. And education funding for kindergarten through
high school -- accounting for 36% of the budget -- is
increasing by 8.2% a year as school enrollment grows almost
twice as rapidly as the state's population.
   Alarmed at the amount of expenditures that are "on
automatic pilot," as some have put it, the Legislature is
considering setting up a commission to work on constitutional
revisions aimed at making the budget more flexible.
   By far the biggest chunk of the "automatic pilot" budget
is that for public schools and community colleges, which
represents 42% of the total. Under Proposition 98, passed by
voters in 1988, lawmakers can't tinker with that budget
unless two-thirds of them vote to suspend the proposition. In
their budget battles the past two years, Gov. Deukmejian
sought to suspend Proposition 98 but Democrats held it
sacrosanct and pushed for tax increases instead.
   That battle could begin anew in January, with the
Democratic-controlled Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee
already compiling a long list of tax alternatives. The
possibilities include a 0.5% increase in the sales tax, which
is projected to bring in $1.5 billion, and increasing the top
personal income tax rate to 10.3% from 9.3%, adding $1.6
billion to state revenue.
   Watching anxiously from the sidelines will be the
California taxpayers. Though the state's voters have
historically been anti-tax -- they turned down most of the
tax-raising initiatives that were on last month's election
ballot -- the current budget crisis is so severe, many say,
that they may have to resign themselves to making a few
sacrifices.

   Troy Today: The Ruins Are Real, the Horse Isn't

   One hundred years after the death of Heinrich Schliemann,
another German archaeologist is leading an international team
of 50 archaeologists, scientists and historians in a new
campaign to answer the fascinating questions raised by
Schliemann at Troy. He became famous as the man who
discovered and excavated the Homeric cities of Troy and
Mycenae between 1870 and his death in December 1890, and
became the father of Aegean prehistoric archaeology.
   In this anniversary year, Prof. Manfred Korfmann of
Tubingen University in West Germany, who is 48 years old, as
was Schliemann when he started digging at Troy in 1870, has a
Turkish permit to excavate the many levels of habitation at
Troy that span nine major periods carbon-dated back to about
3000 B.C. This fabled fortress lies six hours southwest of
Istanbul by bus or car at the southern entrance to the
Dardanelles on the Aegean coast of northwest Turkey.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under Mr. Korfmann's direction, German and Turkish
archaeologists are concentrating on Bronze Age remains of the
walled citadel of Troy from about 3000 B.C. to 1000 B.C.
(Troy I through VII). A team of American archaeologists led
by Stella Miller-Collett and Brian Rose of the University of
Cincinnati are digging outside the walls for remains of
classical and Hellenistic Greek reoccupation of Ilion from
about 700 B.C. to 85 B.C. (Troy VIII), and Roman imperial
rebuilding of Ilion from 85 B.C. to 500 A.D. (Troy IX). There
are also British, Austrian, Mexican and Danish scientists and
scholars working at Troy.
   In addition to the traditional archaeologists and ancient
historians, there are geologists and chemists core-drilling
in the plains and bays below Troy to map the ancient contours
of the coastline; there are geologists and physicists with
magnetometers mapping the streets and walls of the
unexcavated city outside the citadel of Troy; and there are
scientists using thermoluminescence to analyze the dates and
the chemical content of clay pottery, and the nature of food
or wine or oils stored in that pottery.
   There are paleozoologists studying bones found at Troy,
man and mammal; physical anthropologists studying human
skeletons; numismatists looking at coins; epigraphers
studying inscriptions; architectural historians drawing maps
of ancient buildings and streets; and computer experts trying
to organize all this new information in a computerized data
bank.
   I visited Troy just before the third year of current
excavations got under way in June. Mr. Korfmann, who got
hooked on archaeology during a postgraduate motorcycle tour
of the Middle East, enthusiastically explained some of the
old controversies he and his colleagues hope to find
archaeological evidence for or against.
   1. Is Homer's eighth century B.C. epic poem about a
10-year war between Mycenaean Greeks and Trojans a
magnificent myth, or is it based on historical events of the
Bronze Age 13th century B.C.? There is considerable
archaeological evidence for Mycenaean Greek activities and
some settlements on the Aegean coast of Turkey in the 15th to
13th centuries B.C., but no proof that the Trojan War of the
Iliad took place or ended with the destruction of Troy. The
exact date is even more elusive.
   2. Is Homer a historical person? Did he create the 24
books of the Iliad and the Odyssey himself, or collect and
recite stories told by traveling poets for 500 years before?
Ancient Greeks and Romans believed in the essential historic
truth of Homer's story of the Greek siege and destruction of
Troy in the Iliad; and the founding of Rome by Aeneas, one of
the few surviving nobles of Troy, as told by Virgil in the
Aeneid. These stories were part of a classical education in
antiquity. In fifth century B.C. Greece and later in
antiquity, Homer was believed to be a blind Ionian poet,
perhaps from Smyrna or the Island of Chios, who composed the
story of the Iliad in about 730 B.C. and the Odyssey later,
around 700 B.C. Today, he is considered part of an oral
tradition of many poets reciting from memory the first great
epic of Western literature.
   3. Is the high mound of Hissarlik on the fertile plains
south of the modern Turkish town of Canakkale the site of the
"horserich," "windy" Troy described by Homer? Most scholars
think it must be Troy because it fits Homer's description
well and has so many stratified levels of habitation and
pottery. In antiquity Troy must have been 66 feet high from
bedrock -- "steepwalled" to be sure. This summer, the
German-Turkish team excavated two palatial buildings of Troy
II -- about 2500 B.C. -- built of two-foot-long mud bricks
and large square wooden beams. Atop the citadel of Troy, they
suggest this was an important power center more than 1,000
years before the Mycenaeans came from Greece.
   4. Where did the fabled 1,030 ships of the Greek fleet led
by Agamemnon of Mycenae land when they began the siege of
Troy, if they did what Homer tells us in the Iliad? Mr.
Korfmann's excavations from 1982 to 1987 around Besik Bay on
the Aegean coast southwest of Troy have convinced many
scholars that the Greek fleet would have drawn up its ships
on the flat, sandy beaches of what was in the 13th century
B.C. a much deeper bay, closer to the fortress of Troy, about
3.4 miles away. The previous assumption was that the Greek
fleet of the Iliad landed at the mouth of the Skamander River
directly north of Troy, inside the southeast entrance to the
Dardanelles in what was a bay with a river delta. Mr.
Korfmann argues persuasively that the strong five-knot
southward current of Black Sea water funneling through the
mouth of the Dardanelles near Troy, and the steady northwest
winds averaging 10 miles an hour down the straits of the
Dardanelles, would have made it very difficult for Mycenaean
Greek ships to sail up into the Dardanelles to the mouth of
the Skamander. They were fitted only with oars and sails and
had no deep keels needed to sail against the wind.
   5. How extensive were the streets, houses, shops and
temples of the Lower City outside the walls of Troy in the
13th century B.C., at the time of the Trojan War (the
so-called late Troy VI and VII)? How large was the new city
of Ilion, built and inhabited from the 12th to eighth
centuries B.C., through the Dark Ages to the Archaic Period
around 700 B.C. (Troy VIII)? And how much more prosperous did
Ilion become as a trading center and sacred site under the
patronage of Romans from 85 B.C. to 500 A.D. (Troy IX)?
   American classical archaeologists led by Ms.
Miller-Collett and Mr. Rose are exploring the fields south of
the citadel of Troy with magnetometric sounding and mapping,
and digging test trenches that are revealing a larger
settlement in later Greek and Roman times than was previously
suspected. This is breaking new ground, raising new questions
and hopes for answers to some of the riddles of Troy. This
summer, Ms. Miller-Collett cleared a sanctuary in the Lower
City with altars showing more religious activity and
continuous habitation from 1000 B.C. to the birth of Christ
than was previously imagined. Mr. Rose uncovered part of a
large Roman villa or glass factory of the fourth century A.D.
with painted walls, colored marble floors and a small marble
head of the god of health, Asclepius.
   Beyond the digging and publishing of their discoveries in
a new journal, Studia Troica, the Troy Commission of scholars
is making this celebrated site safe from tourist destruction
but also making it accessible to the 300,000 annual visitors.
New walking paths have been built through the site, and a
tourist information center with wall posters explaining the
history of Troy was opened to the public this summer.
Information signs throughout the site explain what you are
looking at each step of your way around the acropolis of
Troy. The biggest surprise for a first-time visitor to Troy
is a huge 60-foot-high dark wooden "Trojan Horse" at the
entrance, so big you can climb a ladder into the horse's
belly and imagine that you are Odysseus or one of his chosen
band waiting for the doomed defenders of Troy to drag your
horse into the citadel, where the Trojans were celebrating
false victory.

   TOKYO -- Sales at Japan's department stores and other
major retail stores grew 6.6% in November from a year earlier
to 1.712 trillion yen ($12.58 billion), the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said.
   The pace of year-on-year growth picked up from October's
4.7%. November volume continued to suffer from sluggish sales
of winter clothes and heaters because of unusually warm
weather, however, a ministry official said. The 6.6%
year-on-year growth is still slower than levels earlier this
year, when retail sales posted double-digit growth.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, November sales were pushed up partly by
high-paced growth of food sales at both department stores and
other retailers. The official said the growth reflects sharp
price increases in fresh vegetables and fruit caused by
unfavorable weather conditions.

   GIVING UP greenbacks for green, executives of a new breed
are becoming guardians of the environment. They're trading
big chunks of pay for jobs they can "believe in" at nonprofit
enterprises.
   Mark Le Doux joined Earthwatch, a Watertown, Mass.,
research group, after seven years with a
management-consulting firm. Bearing calculator and calendar
to informal meetings, he recalls, he was at first viewed by
some colleagues as a "capitalist pig" in the wrong pen.
Though he says he earns 70% less than before, he has found
novel rewards in trips to Australia -- tracking down both
bush folklore and the echidna, an egg-laying mammal.
   Barbara Hoskinson, a former vice president at Bankers
Trust, now works for the World Wildlife Fund, Washington,
D.C. She handles so-called debt-for-nature swaps, in which
the foundation repays a portion of debt for a poor nation
that agrees to set aside land for conservation.
   To gain business acumen, environmental groups increasingly
solicit corporate types. At the Sierra Club, based in San
Francisco, a spokeswoman says, "We recruit more and more from
the profit-making world." Nonprofit it may be, but the
organization's yearly budget is $52 million.
   Especially with the sluggish economy, some business
students ponder a move straight into nonprofits. Fellowships
at Stanford, Harvard and Wharton subsidize salaries for
students who take such jobs. Some schools are forging
loan-forgiveness programs.
   Still, some students worry about ending up with a dead-end
job. David Haddad, a student at Harvard Business School who
worked at a nonprofit last summer, says career tracks are
"little developed" at such outfits. But, says Frances
Hesselbein, director of the Peter F. Drucker Foundation for
Non-Profit Management in New York, that's less of a problem
for people whose priorities have shifted "from success to
significance."
                                                                                                       

   Enemies of Efficiency:
   Meetings and Memos
                                                                                                       

   WHY NOT WORK just 8 1/2 months a year? After all,
executives waste the other 3 1/2 anyway -- the result of
telephone limbo, useless meetings and mindless memos, figures
Accountemps, a Menlo Park, Calif., temporary-services agency.
   But some companies -- often smaller firms -- avoid such
time sinks, mostly by slashing bureaucracy and planning
ahead. "These {companies} aren't on the Fortune 500 list --
they are trying to make it," says Accountemps Chairman Max
Messmer. "You get very efficient when things are tight."
   Staff members zip through 15-minute monthly meetings at
SuperMac Technology, a Silicon Valley start-up that makes
monitors and graphics. Chief Executive Michael McConnell
expects people to hash through problems before a session,
then suggest three solutions and recommend one. Otherwise, he
warns, "meetings become extremely expensive."
   Some bigger companies also see the light. Formal memos
"with carbon copies to the immediate world" are shunned at
the retailer Mervyn's, says Joe Vesce, president of the
Dayton Hudson unit.
   Most timesavers are simply common sense. Larry Baker,
founder of Time Management Center in St. Louis, says
voicemail recordings, for example, should say when a message
will be returned, and should give an emergency contact. He
hears too many recordings, he says, where "you don't know if
Joe Jones is down the hall for two hours or out of town for
two weeks."
                                                                                                       

   More Corporate Boards
   Acquire Foreign Accent
                                                                                                       

   GOING GLOBAL may mean an import for your board of
directors.
   Compared with a year ago, "there is a lot more interest in
having international types on boards," says Jack Lohnes, of
Spencer Stuart &amp; Associates, a Stamford, Conn., search firm.
For example, Chemical maker Hercules, Wilmington, Del.,
recently snared Manfred Caspari, an economist retired from
German government and European Community posts. Mr. Caspari
joins a board of otherwise all-American directors. "We wanted
somebody with a different outlook at the table," says Robert
B. Hessler, director of financial relations for Hercules,
which looks to Europe for nearly one-quarter of its sales.
   For many companies, the 1992 creation of a single European
market and changing trade stances with Canada and Mexico are
compelling incentives to make a similar choice. "There is a
surprising amount of lubrication that goes on to ease
barriers to business abroad," and personal contacts can help,
says Robert Smith, a New York search consultant.
   A foreign director offers more than practical help, says
J. Gerald Simmons, a search executive. They're also a
"cosmetic" to impress overseas clients.
   Signing on a foreign director often proves easier than
companies expect. Many foreign executives are fluent in
English. Mr. Caspari receives the standard Hercules
director's pay for attending 11 meetings annually, as well as

pay has risen 8.2% to an average of $53,000 this academic
year. The average salary for deans has climbed 7.8% to
$88,000, says the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of
Business.

   Drug Could End
   Hemophilic Need
   For Blood Product

   BOSTON (AP) -- Hemophilia patients, many already infected
with the AIDS virus, may be spared from using blood-based
products that can contain other viruses, new research
suggests.
   The first large-scale testing of a new genetically
engineered clotting protein, called recombinant factor VIII,
shows that it works as well as the natural variety of factor
VIII derived from human blood plasma. The development could
allow hemophiliacs to routinely take preventative doses, as
diabetics take insulin, one specialist says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's a tremendous advance and one we are all excited
about for the hemophiliac community," said Dr. Jeanne M.
Lusher, who tested the new material at Children's Hospital of
Michigan in Detroit.
   Hemophilia is caused by a genetic defect that's passed
from mothers to sons and afflicts about 20,000 American men.
Patients fail to produce enough factor VIII, a protein
necessary for the body to form clots to stop bleeding.
Without treatment, cuts may bleed for days into joints,
causing crippling deformities.
   Injections of factor VIII derived from donated blood can
control bleeding. But early in the acquired immune deficiency
syndrome epidemic, factor VIII was widely tainted with HIV,
the AIDS virus, though no one knew it at the time. As a
result, about 60% of hemophiliacs are infected with HIV, even
though most do not have AIDS.
   New purification techniques have made factor VIII free of
HIV, but some specialists worry that some new microbe might
silently infiltrate this treatment again if blood remains the
sole source.
   Now, two companies are competing to introduce factor VIII
made by inserting a human gene into animal tissue that churns
out the protein in large quantities. Since they involve no
blood, the products should not contain viruses or potentially
harmful human proteins that can slip through purification
processes.
   Last year, Baxter Healthcare Corp., a unit of Baxter
International Inc., reported on preliminary use of its
variety of recombinant factor VIII on two patients. In
today's New England Journal of Medicine, Cutter Biological
described results of testing its competing product on 107
hemophiliacs. Both forms of factor VIII are being considered
for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   Most of the patients in the study have been using the
genetically engineered factor VIII for nearly two years. The
treatment effectively controlled their bleeding and caused no
unwanted side effects.
   "It offers the potential for people with hemophilia to
have an interim cure," said Alan Brownstein, executive
director of the National Hemophilia Foundation.

   Don't Let the West Erect a New Iron Curtain

   One year after the collapse of the old Iron Curtain in the
East, there is a growing risk that a new one will be erected
in the West.
   The first great test of post-Cold War, East-West relations
is about to occur. The U.S. has just passed a new and more
liberal immigration bill. Germany, Austria and a number of
other European nations continue to absorb large numbers of
new immigrants. But the West -- and especially Germany -- is
not prepared to cope with what is to come. Tough economic
conditions in Eastern Europe, and serious disorder in the
Soviet Union, could trigger a great new wave of human
migration.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unlike the refugees of past years, most of whom left for
political reasons, today's emigrants are leaving primarily
for economic reasons. Millions of them may flood out of
countries suffering from insufficient food, housing and jobs
into those where conditions are better.
   These refugees represent the loss of an enormous potential
resource for the countries they are leaving. The West should
develop a strategy to work with the Soviet Union and the
nations of Eastern Europe to find ways to induce many of
these people to stay and contribute their energy to economic
reconstruction. But it also needs a strategy to absorb those
who choose to leave; they can inject a new vigor into our own
societies, as so many before them have done.
   In 1990, the number of refugees heading west is likely to
double the million who arrived last year. Most refugees are
continuing to go to Germany, whose constitution grants
automatic citizenship to people of German ancestry. A number
of Soviet Jews are also beginning to settle there. Refugees
will also settle in other parts of Western Europe and the
U.S. A few, especially from Romania, are heading to more
prosperous Eastern European nations such as Czechoslovakia
and Hungary.
   What has occurred so far could be dwarfed by new waves of
emigration. Romania has issued 2.7 million passports to its
citizens, many of whom are desperate to leave. The Soviet
Union plans to enact legislation permitting its citizens to
travel abroad. A bad winter and economic or political chaos
there could bring about a tidal wave of hundreds of thousands
or even millions of souls flooding into Germany, Poland,
Finland, Austria, and beyond.
   This would have profound political and economic
implications. Eastern European nations are already
experiencing high unemployment and anemic growth.
Collectively their import bills will increase by $6 billion
in 1991, when trade with the Soviet Union and within the
former Communist Bloc will be denominated in dollars. And
Eastern Europe will lose another $6 billion if oil stays at
about $30 a barrel.
   The economic situation in Western Europe is considerably
better. But there is growing resistance to paying the
economic and social cost of resettling new immigrants;
workers there are concerned about job displacement,
particularly during an economic slowdown.
   The influx of refugees has been raised as an issue in
Austria, which has resettled 600,000 of them in the past four
decades. In recent elections the opposition right-wing
Freedom Party used the slogan "Vienna must not become
Chicago" -- by which the party meant Vienna should not have
the kind of ethnic mix typical of the American city. The
party raised its share of the vote to 17% from 10%.
   Germany has resettled nearly one million refugees since
last fall. Concerns about immigration have become a
significant domestic political issue. The government is
considering new tests to limit immigration from countries
judged to be without political persecution, e.g. Poland. In
France, resistance is growing to immigration of young North
African workers.
   Although immigration is not as politically sensitive an
issue in the U.S. as in Europe, America's new law, even with
its emphasis on admitting skilled workers, also maintains
tight limits on the number of immigrants.
   Free emigration was a major objective of the U.S. during
the Cold War. That goal was embodied in the 1974
Jackson-Vanik legislation, which made continuation of
U.S.-Soviet detente contingent on Moscow's permitting
increased emigration. It was also a goal of much of Western
Europe. It would be a tragic irony of history if having
realized the collapse of the Iron Curtain, and liberalized
emigration policies in the East, the West now severely
constrains the access of Soviets and other Eastern Europeans
to our nations.
   However much aid the West provides, that aid is unlikely
to avert a major exodus from the East. Western Europe, the
U.S., Canada, Australia and other large Western nations will
need to work out a coordinated approach to accept and
productively employ as many of those refugees as possible,
and particularly those who for hardship, or political
reasons, desperately need access to the West.
   We should do this in part for our own economic reasons.
Immigration is one key reason for America's success and for
progress in many other areas, Europe included. Neither the
U.S. nor other nations should fear more of it. Instead the
West needs to find ways of helping refugees adjust quickly so
they can contribute their talents to promote economic growth.
There are political reasons as well. There is fear of a
return to tougher political conditions in the U.S.S.R., for
example a rise of antiSemitism. Ethnic violence is rising in
several nations of the region. Many citizens of the Soviet
Union and members of ethnic minority groups in East Europe
want to leave while they can; they should be able to do so.
   Massive new migrations could result in a period of
prolonged instability. They could also trigger social
dissent, and nationalism, in the West. The West must be
prepared to avert both with a major coordinated assistance
and absorption effort. Refugees are an enormous potential
economic resource. Putting up a new Iron Curtain deprives the
West of that resource and reduces our moral authority as
well.

   Trump Waxes Confident as Funds Wane

   Donald Trump is running out of money again, but he's not
particularly worried about it.
   The $65 million his bankers lent him in August is almost
depleted. Trump Organization as a whole isn't making any
money, and plenty is leaving it to pay for Mr. Trump's life
style and employee salaries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unless there is a cash infusion by midspring, Mr. Trump's
advisers and bankers say, he will once again have no money to
keep his operations going.
   "He either files for bankruptcy or makes another deal with
his banks," says a banker from one of Mr. Trump's largest
lending institutions. "So far, it's not clear which way it
will go."
   Mr. Trump's 1990s setbacks haven't put a dent in his
1980s-style self-assurance. He has confided to associates
that he is certain the banks will lend more money, since his
bankruptcy still would be worse for them than for him. He
speaks of deals about to happen that will get him out of his
debt trap, much as he boasted in April, right before banks
came to his rescue, that he planned to become "the king of
cash."
   "Mark my words," he said in a recent interview. "In 12
months I will be worth more than I was two years ago."
   To reach that goal, a series of events bordering on
miracles would have to transpire. By June 15, Mr. Trump faces
the probability of having to restructure the bond debt of
both the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza Atlantic City casinos.
He is in default on $245 million in bank debt secured by his
Trump Shuttle airline, and could lose that asset any time the
banks choose to fight him for it.
   He is in default on a bank loan secured by his Trump Plaza
of the Palm Beaches project, and is fighting with the New
York state attorney general to prevent dozens of purchasers
of his $220 million Trump Palace condominium from rescinding
their contracts; associates say Mr. Trump has even discussed
removing his name from the building.
   And, contrary to what was forecast under his bank rescue
last summer, he has not sold a single major asset. His yacht
has sailed from port to port in the Far East to Europe,
searching to no avail for a buyer. Mr. Trump continues to
speak about selling a half-share in New York City's Plaza
Hotel for $800 million.
   In short, 1991 is shaping up as every bit as difficult as
1990 was for Mr. Trump. His nagging problems stem from the
fact that while the banks gave him some time, they didn't
forgive a penny of the $2 billion in principal he owes them.
Of that amount, about $800 million is personally guaranteed;
if he sells an asset for less than he paid for it, he will
continue to owe his lenders whatever the shortfall is.
   Although the personal guarantees weigh down his ability to
recover, there are a number of scenarios under which Mr.
Trump could recoup his lost wealth. His advisers are working
on a complex refinancing of the Trump Shuttle under which Mr.
Trump would be released both from his $245 million equity and
his $135 million unsecured loans. Both were made from
Citibank, which then syndicated them to other lenders.
   Trump Organization is also working toward getting expanded
zoning to develop 72 acres of rail yards on Manhattan's Upper
West Side. That project has been fought tooth and nail by
local residents, and is almost certain to be fought in the
courts for years to come. If the zoning is approved, "the
site becomes worth a billion dollars," Mr. Trump says. "In an
up real estate market, it's more like 1.5 billion."
   If Mr. Trump sounds as though he is still immune from the
laws of financial gravity, he has his reasons. On more than
one occasion over the past year, he has proved his critics
wrong by snatching victory from the jaws of bankruptcy.
   In August, after his lenders were stunned to learn Trump
Organization had a projected negative cash flow of over $100
million, close to 90 banks signed off on a deal to give him
money and time to work out his problems, and deferral of
interest payments on half of his $2 billion in bank debt.
   And last month, after Taj Mahal bondholders vowed not to
let Mr. Trump keep control of the casino after he defaulted
on the debt, he persuaded them to do just that.
   His business brinkmanship has coincided with disruptions
in his personal life. He's been divorced, and is now
photographed frequently with a variety of dates on his arm.
He's added some pounds -- associates say he has a weakness
for a chocolate cake from Cakemasters -- and a few gray
hairs. But he also spends many evenings alone, eating dinner
in bed, watching television and talking to associates on the
phone.
   When he does appear in public, he is still treated like a
star, a fact that isn't lost on his bankers and bond holders.
"From our side, we have no idea whether this guy is the
greatest thing since sliced bread or an Edsel," says Robert
Miller, an attorney with Berlack Israels &amp; Liverman who
represents Taj Mahal bond holders. "But you would be amazed
at the celebrity value of this guy's name, even today."
   But, having invited the public spotlight in happier times,
he now says he wishes the media would turn it toward other
targets. "I'm a private guy. The newspapers shouldn't be
doing a story a day on Donald Trump," he says. "There are
other developers out there, and they're getting killed much
worse than I am."
   But while others have fallen over the past year, few have
dropped from as high a perch as Mr. Trump. Gone are the days
when Mr. Trump could walk into a bank office and receive a
$100 million line of credit on a personal guarantee, as he
did in December 1988 with Bankers Trust. Even as late as
April, after news of Mr. Trump's financial troubles were
widely reported, he drew down the final $25 million of the
Bankers Trust loan.
   Gone, too, are the days when Mr. Trump could make a
purchase based on nothing more than a gut feeling. That's
pretty much what happened in 1986 when Mr. Trump learned of a
twin-tower luxury condominium project in West Palm Beach
whose developer had defaulted on $94 million in obligations.
   As he toured the property, an aide suggested that
purchasing the twin-tower development, even for the price of
$41 million, might not be the best idea, given the cost
overruns and its distance from Mr. Trump's home base in New
York.
   Then, according to a version told by two people close to
Trump Organization, Mr. Trump held up his hand magisterially
and knocked on the sheet rock walls. "Don't tell me about
construction," he said. "I know great construction when I see
it and this is great construction."
   As it turns out, the building wasn't constructed
particularly well. Nor did the project, which came to be
known as Trump Plaza of the Palm Beaches, sell particularly
well. Last week, Mr. Trump was forced by project lender
Marine Midland Bank to auction 35 apartments at as little as
40% of their asking prices.
   Despite such setbacks and the likelihood that tough
financing negotiations lie ahead, Mr. Trump sounds as though
he could go another 12 rounds with his bankers and not even
work up a sweat. "It's in the genes, I really believe that,"
he says. "A lot of guys would have gone into a corner and put
their thumbs in their mouths. I'm a fighter."
   Says his chief financial officer, Stephen Bollenbach: "If
he gets buried by mountains of debt, and keeps shoveling and
nothing happens, it seems to me that he could lose heart at
some point."
   But, Mr. Bollenbach adds: "So far, he hasn't."

   LOS ANGELES -- Unocal Corp. said it discovered natural gas
in a wildcat well on its Hanson Prospect in Kalkaska County,
Mich.
   In a test, the well produced at a rate of about nine
million cubic feet of gas a day through an 18/64-inch choke,
with a flowing tubing pressure of 4,145 pounds a square inch,
at depths of between 10,890 and 10,950 feet. Unocal
calculated the absolute open flow rate at 91 million cubic
feet a day.

<TEXT>
   Unocal operates and holds a 39.3% working interest in the
well. Shell Western Exploration &amp; Production Inc., a U.S.
unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, holds the remaining 60.7%.
   Separately, Unocal said it successfully tested gas in two
geological areas on Block 12/27 in the Gulf of Thailand. The
Moragot No. 1 well was drilled to a depth of 11,120 feet, and
gas flowed to the surface. The Pailin No. 2 well was drilled
to 11,572 feet and tested a combined rate of 14.8 million
cubic feet of gas and 189 barrels of condensate a day through
a half-inch choke. Unocal's Unocal Thailand unit holds a 35%
interest in the block. It expects to drill four more
exploration wells in 1991.

   A Nonbeliever's Lesson for the Holidays

   YOUGHAL, Ireland -- Content, as many nonbelievers are, to
spend at least one day a year going through the motions of
religious observance in a church, I spent an hour on
Christmas morning in St. Mary's, reflecting upon tolerance
and the injuries inflicted by fanaticism.
   The stones of St. Mary's Collegiate Church here in this
old town, halfway along Ireland's south coast, speak
eloquently enough on the topic of toleration and its absence.
The church was founded in the 11th century, re-edified by
Thomas, eighth Earl of Desmond in 1468, then pillaged by his
descendant, the 16th earl, in the Geraldine revolt in 1579.
The 16th earl, insurgent against the Norman occupiers,
supposedly stabled his horses in the church, though this
could well have been Norman propaganda.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In 1649 Oliver Cromwell, subduing Catholic Ireland,
quartered his army in Youghal and was greeted by the prudent
townsfolk with the same enthusiasm with which they
subsequently welcomed the return to the throne of Charles II.
When I was growing up the Protestant congregation was sparse,
mustering under a hundred even at Christmas, in a place that
could hold over a thousand.
   As I listened, this Christmas morning, to triumphant
recitations from scripture about the birth of the Christ
child, my thoughts were mostly on a triumph scored not by
Christianity but by Islam.
   On Christmas Eve came news that seemed to suggest that the
fatwa, or sentence of death decreed by the late Ayatollah
Khomeini against the novelist Salman Rushdie for blasphemy,
had taken its toll.
   In Britain Hesham el Essawy, chairman of the Islamic
Society for the Promotion of Religious Tolerance, announced
that "Salman Rushdie has now embraced the Islamic faith for
the first time. That means that under Islamic law the slate
must be wiped clean and his past sins forgiven." Mr. Essawy,
a dentist by profession and critical of the fatwa, was
careful to add that "some people are suggesting that Mr.
Rushdie has issued such a statement now to save his skin, but
I know that he is a man whose arm cannot be twisted. What he
says is what he believes. I also know that his conversion was
not accomplished yesterday but two months ago."
   In telephone interviews after this announcement, Mr.
Rushdie was quoted by the Times of London for Dec. 26 as
saying (in the reporter's words) that he "accepted that there
is no God but Allah and that Mohammed was his last prophet."
Mr. Rushdie said he would not be publishing a paperback
version of "The Satanic Verses" -- the novel that caused
offense in the first place -- and said (in his own words)
that "I declare that I do not agree with any statement in my
novel `The Satanic Verses' uttered by any of the characters
who insult the prophet Mohammed or who cast aspersions on
Islam or upon the authenticity of the Holy Koran or who
reject the divinity of Allah."
   It was not clear the day after Christmas whether the
mullahs in Teheran would say it was fine for Mr. Rushdie to
come out of hiding, but they must be feeling satisfied by his
protestations.
   All in all it was a good couple of days for militant
Islam, since French soldiers serving in the U.S.-led
multinational force in Saudi Arabia were unable to conduct
public Christian devotions for fear of offending the Saudis.
British soldiers wanting to partake in Christian services had
-- for similar reasons -- to go to Bahrain to do so.
Apparently the American cantonments were sufficiently large
to permit secluded and furtive religious celebration of
Christmas without affront to Islamic propriety.
   My gloom at the toll taken in these instances by the
forces of superstition was deepened by the lesson at that
point being read from the lectern in St. Mary's. It was taken
from one of St. Paul's distasteful letters in which the
precepts of a presumptively historical, humane and human
Jesus were perverted into intolerant doctrine. I was reminded
of a letter written by Thomas Jefferson to John Adams:
   "Among the sayings and discourses imputed to him {Jesus}
by his biographers, I find many passages of fine imagination,
correct morality, and of the most lovely benevolence; and
others, again, of so much ignorance, of so much absurdity, so
much untruth and imposture, as to pronounce it impossible
that such contradictions should have proceeded from the same
being. I separate, therefore, the gold from the dross,
restore to him the former, and leave the latter to the
stupidity of some and the roguery of others of his
disciples." Jefferson rightly called Paul "the first
corrupter of the doctrines of Jesus."
   The profile of Jesus I've always found alluring is that of
the human character drawn by Moncure Conway, in his 1906
memoir "My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East." Conway
came to the conclusion, after much scholarly study of
Christian texts and their precedents in Buddhist and
Zoroastrian writings, that the Jesus of the Gospels and of
St. Paul masked a very different historical character:
   "He whom Church traditions have without scriptural warrant
represented as a sort of peasant surrounded by peasant
disciples, was on the contrary a gentleman of local
distinction, enjoying the friendship of high personages,
including Pilate and his wife, and that he gathered around
him a number of anti-sacrifice reformers large enough to
protect him in driving the animals out of the temple." Conway
emphasized that in its original version, Christ's attack on
the moneychangers in the temple ("a legitimate business") was
in fact an assault on the crudities of animal sacrifice. For
Conway, Paul "corrupted the morals of the religious
movement." Paul's "immeasurable crime" was to restore in the
form of Jesus himself the sacrificial victims Jesus drove
from the temple: "It is due to Paul that Christianity rests
upon a human sacrifice."
   Were the narratives about Christ read as though dug up in
Persia and related to Zoroaster, Conway wrote, "we should
find in them a gentleman, traditionally of high birth,
educated, and in the best sense a man of the world. He eats
and drinks with personages of rank, admires the Greeks,
exalts cosmopolitan Solomon and the `Gentile' Queen of Sheba
above the provincial sectarians of his time, and repudiates
priesthood, sacrifices, sabbath, and pharisaic morality. His
familiarity with refined and polite social life appears in
poetic parables and metaphors . . . a lost pearl, masters of
fields and vineyards, wedding garments, royal ambassadors,
precedence at feasts, the fine robe and ring, and the fatted
calf."
   The civilized individual portrayed by Conway was
transmuted into an accouterment of a religion that has
brought untold suffering upon the world, with cruelties
inflicted in the name of Christian love that far outstrip
horrors done in the name of Islam. In this perspective
Christmas Eve did not seem an entirely inappropriate day for
Mr. Rushdie to have made his penitential march to the Islamic
equivalent of Canossa. In truth, as the poet Lucretius wrote,
"Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum." How great are the
evils that religion has managed to inflict]

   Tokyo stocks ended mixed in razor-thin trading Wednesday
as concerns about the Mideast and the situation in the Soviet
Union continued to discourage investor participation.
   The number of gaining issues increased during the
afternoon session, however, in response to advances in
Japanese bond prices. Some investors, anticipating that some
investment trust funds will start spending fresh money on
stocks, came into the market to buy, traders said.

   In Europe Wednesday, most markets were closed for
holidays.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues rose 119.68 to
23887.56, the first advance in four trading days. The index
lost 351.72 points Tuesday.
   In trading early Thursday, the Nikkei was up 33.76 to
23921.32.
   Volume on the first section Wednesday was estimated at 220
million shares, little changed from 228.7 million shares
Tuesday. Declining issues outnumbered advancing shares 462 to
441, while 161 others remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which lost 39.65 points Tuesday, was up 4.64
points, or 0.27%, at 1729.81.
   The Second Section Index, which dropped 46.40 points
Tuesday, was down 17.17 points, or 0.63%, to close at
2718.07, the lowest level this year. Volume in the second
section was estimated at four million shares, down from 5.6
million shares Tuesday.
   Stock prices moved stably for most of the day, helped by a
decline in selling pressure, traders said.
   Transactions for stocks traded Wednesday will be settled
on Jan. 4, the first trading day of 1991, and fund managers
who are extending their New Year holidays to Jan. 4 didn't
place any orders, some traders said.
   "Life insurance companies {which have been active
profit-takers recently} were very quiet. . . . It helped to
thin selling," said a trader at Wako Securities.
   Buying activity was also sluggish as most investors
refrained from increasing their positions ahead of the long
holidays.
   The market has seen a year-end rally every year in the
past decade. But this year that won't be the case,
participants said.
   The Middle East crisis and the uncertain political
direction of the Soviet Union are "too-big factors," said
Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock trading at Okasan
Securities. Fears that the situations may worsen during the
holidays are keeping investors from buying, he said.
   With only one and a half days of trading left in the year,
many analysts predict that trading will reflect a tug-of-war
between buying by investment trust funds and selling by
margin traders.
   According to Shin Tokoi, general manager of stock trading
at County NatWest Securities, about 250 billion yen ($1.84
billion) is expected to be newly invested on the market
beginning Thursday. Meanwhile, he said, about 350 billion yen
of stock exists as potential sell pressure prompted by margin
calls in the week.
   Most investors can't or don't want to participate toward
the year end other than to hedge risks trading in futures and
options, Mr. Tokoi said.
   Despite the relative firmness of stock prices Wednesday,
substantial trade activities were nonexistent, he said.
   Fumihiko Ishii, manager of investment research at Nomura
Securities, said few investors are likely to increase their
positions ahead of the New Year holidays, but that "doesn't
necessarily mean stock prices will decline." He predicts
stable price moves for the remaining trading days.
   "Investors have few reasons to expect stock price plunges
from the current level" ahead of Jan. 15, the deadline set by
the United Nations for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, Mr.
Ishii added.
   As the bond market firmed in the afternoon,
interest-rate-sensitive, large-capital shares were pushed up
by bargain hunters, traders said. Among shipbuilding
companies, Hitachi Zosen rose 19 yen to 479 yen and Kawasaki
Heavy Industries gained 5 yen to 526 yen.
   Construction shares ended mostly higher. Ohbayashi gained
10 yen to 860 yen, while Kajima rose 20 yen to 1,580 yen.
   Shimizu ended flat at 1,500 yen, however.
   Blue-chip electronics concerns advanced in the afternoon,
with Hitachi up 20 yen at 1,110 yen. Pioneer gained 20 yen to
4,050 yen, while Sharp rose 20 yen to 1,170 yen.
   Separately, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said that in the week
ended Dec. 21, the balance of margin buying declined 177.5
billion yen to 4.959 trillion yen, the seventh consecutive
week of decline. The balance of outstanding short positions,
meanwhile, fell 4.7 billion yen to 632.5 billion yen.
   Elsewhere Wednesday, share prices closed lower in Paris
and Madrid. Markets in London, Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels,
Amsterdam, Stockholm, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Oslo, Milan and
Johannesburg were closed for holidays.
   Share prices closed lower in Singapore, higher in Taipei,
and mixed in Manila and Seoul. The markets in Sydney, Hong
Kong and Wellington were closed for holidays.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.

   Abreast of the Market:
   Industrials Climb 15.84, Fulfilling
   Expectations of a Year-End Rally

   NEW YORK -- Good cheer spread through the stock market
yesterday, fulfilling expectations for a traditional year-end
rally.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average added a solid 15.84
points to close at 2637.13.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But traders were wary of reading too much into the
market's strength, noting that activity was relatively
lighter than even during Monday's truncated session.
   About 54 million shares had changed hands by 2 p.m. EST
yesterday, less than the 57 million shares that had traded by
the same time Monday when the market closed two hours early.
Nearly 79 million shares traded all of yesterday.
   With three trading sessions remaining in 1990, the
industrials remain more than 116 points below where they
started the year.
   Stocks and bonds both got a lift from an Israeli news
report that a meeting between Secretary of State James Baker
and Iraq's Saddam Hussein had been set for Jan. 9 in Baghdad.
   The State Department denied that a date had been set,
however, and said no behind-the-scenes negotiations with the
Iraqis were taking place. And while persistent reports of
back-channel talks between Washington and Baghdad have raised
some hopes that war can be avoided, rising oil prices told of
continuing concern in some quarters. Crude oil for February
delivery rose $1.30 to $27.22 a barrel.
   Nonetheless, the stock market held its early gains and
rose through the session, largely on seasonal factors.
   Jack Solomon, technical analyst at Bear Stearns, says much
of the buying came from year-end window dressing by portfolio
managers who have lots of cash remaining on their books.
   Other market watchers said some traders are buying shares
now to catch the wave of new money that many expect to flow
into the market from pension funds after the first of the
year. That new money typically drives share prices higher
during the first week of January.
   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.95 to 330.85;
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.59 to
180.60; and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 0.84 to
306.55.
   Big Board advancers led decliners, 774 to 639, with 545
stocks unchanged.
   The major oil companies gained along with oil prices.
Chevron gained 2 to 73 1/4, Texaco jumped 1 3/4 to 60 1/2,
Mobil added 1 1/8 to 58 1/4, and Atlantic Richfield added 1
7/8 to 124 3/8. Pennzoil, up 1 3/8 to 65, said it raised its
stake in Chevron to 9.4%.
   William M. LeFevre, market strategist at Advest Inc.,
notes that the market is close to having retraced half the
drop from its July highs to its October lows.
   He says stocks may pull back once they have reached that
level, but he doubts that the Dow Jones Industrial Average
will fall further than the low 2500s.
   Many money managers missed the rally from the October lows
and now are waiting for share prices to drop so they can get
back into the market, he adds. But that eager money will
cushion any market declines and keep sell-offs shallow.
   "I think we've seen the bear market's low," says Mr.
LeFevre.
   Tiffany tumbled 4 3/8 to 37 1/4. The retailer said that
while its world-wide holiday sales rose 8% from last year,
U.S. holiday sales were below expectations. The company said
the weak domestic sales justified a downward revision in
earnings estimates for the fourth quarter ending Jan. 31.
   According to Zack's Investment Research, five analysts
surveyed expected Tiffany to earn between $1.02 a share and
$1.22 a share in the quarter. Tiffany said it still could
reach $1.02 a share, which is what it earned in the year-ago
quarter.
   Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber added 3/8 to 17 7/8, and Goodyear
Tire &amp; Rubber rose 3/4 to 18 1/8. Despite yesterday's uptick
in oil prices, both companies will benefit from the recent
decline in the price of crude oil from its high above $40 a
barrel.
   UAL rose 2 to 115 but said it didn't know why the stock
was moving. UAL's gain is all the more surprising given
yesterday's surge in oil prices. Rising oil prices generally
depress airline stocks as investors anticipate higher fuel
costs.
   Pan Am picked up 1/8 to 1 3/8, just as merger talks with
Trans World Airlines hit snags. TWA's owner, Carl Icahn, said
Tuesday that Pan Am officials pulled out of a scheduled
Monday meeting concerning his proposal to acquire Pan Am.
   Mr. Icahn also questioned the seriousness of Pan Am's
interest in merging, after learning through news reports that
Pan Am is considering a $150 million offer for its lucrative
shuttle from PacifiCorp, which was down 1/8 to 22 1/8. NWA
Inc. would operate the shuttle. A Pan Am spokesman retorted
that Mr. Icahn had yet to offer a definitive proposal.
   AMR dropped 3/8 to 48 7/8. The airline holding company
said pilots at its American Airlines unit are staging a
sickout over stalled contract talks and have contributed to
flight cancellations. The pilots' union denied it organized a
protest.
   Nacco Industries fell 3/8 to 29. The company expects to
take a one-time charge of $10.3 million, or $1.16 a share, in
the fourth quarter, due primarily to restructuring and plant
closings from recently acquired businesses.
   Blockbuster Entertainment eased 3/8 to 25 7/8. The
video-store chain is preparing a massive data base of the
movies its 30 million customers rent and plans to sell
information from the data base next year to direct mailers.
   Some financial stocks rallied. First City Bancorp. jumped
1/2 to 3 1/2, CalFed added 5/8 to 4 3/8, and Baltimore
Bancorp rose 1/4 to 4 1/4.
   Global Natural Resources edged up 1/4 to 6. Noel Group
raised its stake in the company to just above 25%.
   Lamson &amp; Sessions rose 1/4 to 4 3/8. Investor Mario
Gabelli increased his stake in the company to just past 5%.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.40
to 304.99.
   Go-Video dropped 5/8 to 3 1/4 after filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for a 1.5 million-share
offering.
   American Stock Exchange volume totaled 7,969,745 shares
compared with 4,668,910 Monday. Decliners outnumbered
advancers 278 to 233, with 315 unchanged.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. International Trade Commission said
it will conduct a final anti-dumping investigation into
China's export of sodium thiosulfate. The Commerce Department
already has issued a preliminary finding that dumping of the
chemical is occurring.
   The question of how China practices trade has taken on
increasing importance lately, as China's trade surplus with
the U.S. threatens to leap beyond that of Germany and Taiwan
next year, ranking it only behind Japan. U.S. concerns are
that China is achieving much of its advantage through unfair
trade practices such as dumping, defined as the selling of
goods in a foreign country at less than fair value.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. final investigation will consider whether an
industry in the U.S. is materially injured, or is threatened
with material injury, or whether the establishment of an
industry in the U.S. is materially retarded by foreign-made
goods being sold in the U.S. at less than fair value.
   Similar investigations are being conducted concerning
possible dumping of the chemical by Germany and the United
Kingdom.

   HOLLISTON, Mass. -- Money-fund yields were little changed
in the latest week, despite the recent decline in short-term
interest rates.
   "Moves in recent weeks to lower interest rates have been
counteracted by year-end pressures that drive rates up," said
Martha Wittbrodt, editor of IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report.
"But I expect yields to drop after the first of the year."
</LP>

   The average seven-day compound yield, which assumes
reinvestment of dividends, remained at 7.42% in the week
ended Tuesday, according to Donoghue's. The average 30-day
compound yield eased to 7.47% from 7.49%.
   Assets of the 453 taxable funds tracked by the newsletter,
based here, decreased $1 billion, to $419.2 billion.
   The average maturity of the investments in fund portfolios
decreased one day, to 51 days. The funds invest in such
things as commercial paper -- or short-term corporate IOUs --
short-term bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills.
   The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
eased to 7.16% from 7.17%. The average 30-day simple yield
eased to 7.21% from 7.23%.
   Assets of the 245 tax-free funds fell $50 million, to
$85.5 billion, Donoghue's reported. The average seven-day
compound yield increased to 5.87% from 5.55%. The latest
yield is equal to 8.15% for an investor in the 28% tax
bracket and 8.76% for someone paying 33% in taxes.
   The average maturity of the tax-exempt funds increased one
day, to 55 days.

   The Nation's Most Anticipated Recession

   There were holiday seasons back in the 1930s when the
atmosphere was much gloomier. Men were standing on street
corners selling apples for a nickel and finding buyers not so
much because the buyers were charitable as because they were
hungry. Ice-cream cones and, in some farm areas, even quarts
of milk sold for a nickel, a coin that had a real value in
those unhappy days.
   There is gloom now, of course, but perhaps even more
apprehension. The apprehension, moreover, has been strong for
nearly five years. The economy slowed sharply in early 1986,
and the inflation-adjusted gross national product actually
declined in the second quarter of that year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve stepped on the monetary accelerator
for a while, but it soon became worried as inflation heated
up. A return to tight money may or may not have contributed
to the stock market crash of October 1987, but the crash
convinced many people that the recession was upon us. The Fed
calmed the panic by easing for a time, but soon it was on its
new track of gradual restraint.
   The economy was going almost nowhere through 1988, 1989
and 1990. Any quarter with a GNP growth rate of more than 1%
began to be regarded as a relatively robust period.
Businessmen, expecting growth to become even slower, cut back
on hiring and stepped up layoffs.
   Companies watched their inventories more closely, too.
Many began reducing borrowing and trying to pay off some old
debts, trying to get their balance sheets into better shape.
This made individual companies look better, but it didn't
stimulate a lot of economic growth.
   If a recession now is under way or about to start, U.S.
business this time has developed an unusual way to approach
it. "In the past," says Stephen Roach, a Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
economist, "businesses have been slow in coming to grips with
the reality of recession -- waiting until the weakening of
demand was in full swing before biting the bullet on
layoffs."
   For example, manufacturing employment typically has risen
more than 2% in the final year of an expansion. In the past
year, by contrast, factory jobs have decreased 2%.
Manufacturers' efforts at cost-containment were also spurred
by their determination to become more competitive with
foreign firms.
   Hanging on to employees until the last minute in prior
recessions had meant that manufacturing productivity usually
declined in the recession, hurting U.S. competitiveness. The
different approach this time has meant that manufacturing
productivity rose 3.9% in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, a
period many analysts think will include the latest cyclical
peak in the U.S. economy. After juggling the figures a couple
of times, the Commerce Department now says inflation-adjusted
GNP rose by only 1.4% in the third quarter. Mr. Roach has
decreased his estimate for the current quarter; he now
expects real GNP to fall at a 3.6% annual rate, compared with
an earlier forecast of a 2.6% decrease.
   The strong productivity growth in manufacturing is one
reason Mr. Roach expects the recession to be fairly mild,
with real GNP declining at an annual rate of only 1% in the
first half of 1991 and then picking up smartly in the third
quarter, rising at an annual rate of 3.7%.
   Unfortunately, the services industries aren't likely to be
much help. Services kept the economy growing through much of
the 1980s, while manufacturing was struggling to make headway
against foreign competition. But service productivity, never
very good, has gotten worse as the economy as weakened.
   The major reason for services' poorer performance shows up
in hiring patterns. Service industries slowed their hiring in
the year before the assumed business cycle peak in the 1990
third quarter, but not nearly as much as manufacturers did.
The services slowdown, says Mr. Roach, "was totally
insufficient to generate any measurable improvements in
service-sector productivity. Thus, services remain trapped in
a quagmire of inefficiency."
   This could mean that the recession will be America's first
white-collar slump, with manufacturing continuing to do
fairly well. The recession also could put pressure on service
industries to do more to improve their productivity.
   The slowdown in service employment growth in the past year
has been mainly in managerial and professional positions.
There has been little change in the hiring pace in technical,
sales and support occupations. "From the standpoint of
productivity enhancement," Mr. Roach says, "this result
remains puzzling -- especially for services, where intensive
reliance on the labor-saving potential of information
technology should have been more successful in reducing the
back-office content of its white-collar work force."
   So we've been expecting this recession for nearly five
years and manufacturers have done a reasonably good job of
preparing for it. Now if someone could figure out a way to
make service companies more efficient, maybe we would do a
better overall job of dealing with downturns.

   NEW YORK -- Stocks gained and bonds rallied on reports
that Iraq and the U.S. are preparing for talks on the Mideast
crisis. The dollar closed mixed in quiet trading.
   An Israeli newspaper reported that U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III will likely meet Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein in Baghdad on Jan. 9. The State Department denied a
date has been set, however.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Still, bonds and stocks rose on the news, ignoring a sharp
gain in crude oil prices. Long-term Treasury bonds gained
nearly a point, or almost $10 for each $1,000 face amount.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 15.84 to 2637.13.
   But many investors say they are wary of any stock-market
gains until the Mideast conflict is resolved and the
minefield of fourth-quarter earnings reports is traversed.
   The rout in Tiffany &amp; Co.'s stock yesterday showed that
the bad news bears were wide awake on a slow day. Tiffany
said sales during the holiday shopping period rose, but not
as much as expected. Tiffany stock fell 4 3/8 to 37 1/4, a
decline of 10.5%.
   "Most people are anticipating a number of poor"
fourth-quarter earnings reports in January, said A. Marshall
Acuff, strategist at Smith Barney. "A lot of people are
clinging to the sidelines and taking a wait-and-see
attitude."
   Government bond traders said the Mideast conflict is the
most significant question currently facing bond investors.
"The Fed has made its move" to lower interest rates, "so
basically we are hanging around waiting for Iraq," one trader
said. Short-term rates are expected to drop further as signs
of weak consumer spending proliferate.
   Japanese banks were bidding aggressively for
dollar-denominated short-term investments, helping to support
the U.S. currency against the yen. But with U.S. interest
rates trending down, traders have no confidence that a
sustained rally is in store for the dollar.
   The dollar slid against the German mark and other European
currencies on profit-taking following its big advance late
last week after Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's
resignation raised fears about stability in the U.S.S.R.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stocks rose. Advancing issues narrowly outpaced decliners
774 to 639 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume totaled
78,730,000 shares.
                                                                                                       

   Bonds advanced. The yield on the benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond fell to 8.28% from 8.36% on Dec. 24.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar finished mixed. In late New York trading, the
dollar was quoted at 1.5368 marks, and 136.25 yen, compared
with 1.5440 marks and 136 yen late Monday.

   NEW YORK -- Unlisted stocks were unable to match the gains
posted by New York Stock Exchange issues yesterday and ended
fractionally lower in thin trading.
   Traders say many market participants were absent as they
extended their Christmas holiday. National Market System
volume totaled 57.4 million shares, the fourth lowest daily
volume recorded this year.

   "Portfolio managers aren't reachable. The players just are
not in today," said George Jennison, co-manager of OTC
trading at Wheat First-Butcher &amp; Singer. "It's tough to get
anything done."
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell a fractional 0.01 to
372.40. Meanwhile, the Big Board composite index gained 0.59,
or 0.33%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 15.84,
or 0.60%.
   While year-end portfolio adjustments helped push the
industrial average higher, that momentum didn't carry to the
over-the-counter market. But traders see yearend related
factors boosting volume in unlisted shares later this week
and next Monday.
   Steve Bliss, head of OTC trading at Mabon Nugent, says "a
little year-end rally" could develop later this week based on
portfolio adjustments. But he says that once 1991 begins,
there will be little reason to buy stocks ahead of the Jan.
15 United Nations deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait.
   "I think everyone is going to be a little tentative
waiting for Jan. 15," Mr. Bliss says. Uncertainty about a
possible military confrontation in the Middle East has put
downward pressure on the market since the August invasion.
   Advancing Nasdaq issues narrowly outnumbered decliners 846
to 826 yesterday.
   Enstar Group led active issues, closing down 1/32 to 3/32
on unusually heavy volume of 2.3 million shares. About
245,000 Enstar shares typically change hands daily.
   Other active issues include: MCI Communications, which
ended unchanged at 19 1/2; First Executive Corp., which
gained 3/32 to 1/2; Apple Computer, which dropped 1/4 to 43
3/4; and Intel, which shed 1 3/8 to 37 1/2.
   Acclaim Entertainment added 1 1/2 to 5 1/4. The stock was
included this week on a Barron's list of stocks whose share
prices have been battered recently despite positive earnings
prospects and solid fundamentals. Acclaim's chief financial
officer, Anthony Williams, says he also suspects
short-covering aided in the stock's rise, according to Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report.
   Short-covering refers to the purchase of shares by people
who have previously sold borrowed shares. Short sellers
profit when the shares they have borrowed decline in price,
and they are able to replace the borrowed equities with
shares purchased at a discount.
   Micro Healthsystems gained 1 1/4 to 22 1/2 after having
added a point Monday. Its chief financial officer, Walter
Cruickshank, said Monday that there were no corporate
developments to account for the rise. But he noted that the
firm was favorably mentioned in the January issue of the
"Special Situations Letter," a newsletter published by
Financial Research Center Inc. of Holliston, Mass.
   Repligen rose 3/4 to 12 3/4. Chief Financial Officer
Ramesh L. Ratan says he isn't aware of any corporate
developments to explain the increase. The move, he says, may
be a continued reaction to positive comments about the firm
made on Dec. 17 by Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst Jeffrey Casdin,
according to DJPIR.
   Octel Communications slumped 1/2 to 12 after losing a
point on Monday. Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Steve Levy
recently trimmed his earnings estimates for several makers of
voice and data communications equipment, including Octel,
Digital Microwave and Tellabs.
   Tellabs added 1/8 to 15, after dropping 1/4 on Monday;
Digital Microwave rose 1/2 to 17 3/4, after shedding 1 5/8
Monday.
   M.S. Carriers gained 3/4 to 17 3/4, a move that the firm
was unable to explain. A spokesman said there were no
developments to account for the advance, and said the firm is
comfortable with analysts' 1990 earnings estimates of about
$1.32 a share, according to DJPIR. The company earned $1.57 a
share in 1989.
   Envirosource rose 7/16 to 4. A company spokesman said the
move was in reaction to news late last week that the Ohio
Hazardous Waste Facility Board voted to reconsider a decision
that had denied a subsidiary's expansion at a waste facility.
The stock advanced 5/16 on Monday.
   AST Research rose 5/8 to 34 1/8. This newspaper yesterday
reported that the computer maker continues to gain market
share and increase its earnings as it introduces new
products. Another personal computer maker, Dell Computer,
rose 5/8 to 16 5/8.

   JPS TEXTILE GROUP Inc. (Greenville, S.C.) -- Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded the credit ratings
of JPS, citing the company's plan to restructure under a
"pre-packaged" Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing. About $460
million of the company's long-term debt is affected, the
rating firm said. The ratings downgraded to Ca from Caa are
variabe-rate notes, senior subordinated notes, subordinated
debentures and senior subordinated discount notes. The rating
of the company's preferred stock remains at Ca, Moody's said.
JPS Textile, the successor company to much of J.P. Stevens &amp;
Co., declined to comment on Moody's downgrade. In a
pre-packaged Chapter 11 reorganization, a company wins
creditors' approval before making its filing in bankruptcy
court. Such filings, in theory, can be resolved much more
quickly than ordinary bankruptcy law cases. In Chapter 11, a
company gets court protection against creditor lawsuits while
it attempts to come up with a plan to pay its debt. Odyssey
Partners, a New York investment banking firm, led a buy-out
of the textile company in late 1988.

   NIPPON TELEGRAPH &amp; TELEPHONE Corp. -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. assigned a triple-A rating to Nippon's offering
of 6.8% bonds due 2001. The issue totals 50 billion yen ($370
million). Moody's said it based its rating on NTT's "dominant
market position and solid financial profile." But it noted
that NTT revenue and profit growth are slowing because of
increased competition in its markets and price erosion. While
Moody's expects NTT's competitors "to make gradual but
limited increases in their shares of the market," the agency
said NTT has increased capital spending, which "should enable
the company to maintain service levels and also permit the
introduction of new services." As a result, "NTT will
maintain a strong balance sheet, generate improved earnings
and increase its coverage of fixed charges," Moody's said.

   TUCSON ELECTRIC POWER Co. (Tucson, Ariz.) -- Moody's
Investor's Service Inc. downgraded the securities rating of
this utility's first mortgage and secured pollution control
issues to Single-B-3 from Single-B-2. About $500 million of
securities is affected. Moody's attributed the downgrade to
two adverse Arizona state court decisions that could force
the company to take up to $350 million in pretax write-downs,
"adding to the continued deterioration of an already weakened
financial condition," the agency said. Moody's said it did
not change the company's ratings on unsecured pollution
control issues at Caa and preferred stock at Caa. A spokesman
for the company declined to comment.

   Can Rate Cuts Continue to Spur Stock Market Growth?

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Can the stock market keep climbing on interest
rate cuts?
   Last week, when the Federal Reserve knocked the discount
rate it charges on loans to financial institutions down to
6.5% from 7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average immediately
leaped 33 points. But for the rest of the week, the Dow
industrials were only able to add six points. The stock
market's response to recent rate cuts has been muted, at
best.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Further interest rate cuts are likely to result in one-day
boosts in stocks. But investors can't count on a broad,
extended stock-market rally based on rate declines alone,
analysts say. For stocks to rally, investors will have to be
convinced that interest rate cuts will get corporate profits
growing again.
   Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu in New
York, agrees with most analysts that short-term rates are
headed lower; he says the bellwether federal funds rate that
banks charge each other on overnight loans could drop to 6%
by July from the current 7%. But the Fed will reduce rates
further because of surprising weakness in the economy, he
says.
   Mr. Fabbri continues: "I think this recession is going to
be fairly deep, and the normal response {in the economy} to
interest-rate cuts may be more muted this time. That means it
will take longer to get things moving again and thus deeper
rate cuts than you might expect."
   That kind of economy won't be a favorable environment for
either corporate earnings or stock prices, he says. "In the
kind of weak economy I'm talking about, a drop in short-term
rates to 6% from 7% won't generate much in the way of
corporate profits, and therefore the outlook for stocks isn't
very good."
   Typically, a rate reduction by the Federal Reserve has an
immediate impact on stock prices. When yields drop on
money-market investments and bonds, stocks become relatively
more attractive. Earlier this year, when the Fed attempted to
engineer an economic "soft landing" (moderating inflation and
declining interest rates) by lowering interest rates, the Dow
industrials climbed to nearly 3000.
   But after the Fed cuts short-term rates, a guessing game
begins. What impact will rates have on consumer spending?
What impact will lower rates have on corporate profits six
months from now?
   For one thing, Mr. Fabbri cautions investors to look
beyond just short-term interest rates, which are the only
ones that the Fed can directly influence. "When you think
about stocks, you have to think about both short-term and
long-term interest rates," he says. "Short-term rates provide
liquidity and credit and are a sign of what the Fed is trying
to do, but long-term {bond} rates provide an alternative
investment to stocks."
   He thinks because of concerns about the Middle East,
yields on long-term Treasury bonds won't be falling nearly as
fast as short-term rates, thus making bonds a more attractive
investment option than stocks.
   Indeed, asset allocators -- who switch big pools of money
between stocks, bonds and cash -- say that stocks are not
cheap relative to bonds, but only fairly valued at current
prices. And many of these investors are not buying stocks
aggressively because they are afraid of bad earnings
surprises that can torpedo stocks.
   "We think stocks and bonds are relatively equal, but the
risk is that earnings could be revised" lower still, says
Michael Leavy, investment analyst at QuantiLogic Asset
Management Co., an asset allocation firm. The firm's $1.4
billion in investments has about 25% less stocks than normal.
   Overseas investors, meanwhile, may shy away from stocks
because of continued worry about the dollar's weakness.
Midland's Mr. Fabbri thinks these global investors won't be
much interested in owning either U.S. stocks or bonds. That
would eliminate a key source of demand for stocks that could
help to bolster prices.
   Like the asset allocators, however, Mr. Fabbri thinks
stocks are about fairly valued currently.
   "I would argue that we might not go up from here, but we
probably won't go down a lot either," he says. "A big drop
would depend on some worsening of the Middle East situation
or some worsening of the financial problems being exposed at
banks and insurance companies."
   Not everyone thinks the outlook for stocks is stagnant.
Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
says investors should ready their buy list for stocks
sometime in early spring.
   Sure, corporate profits are going to get worse from here.
Merrill Lynch is forecasting a 16.1% decline in average
earnings per share for the stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index in the first quarter of 1991, compared to the
year-earlier period. Earnings for the second quarter of 1991
should be down 28.3%, Merrill Lynch says.
   But by the end of the second quarter, lower interest rates
will begin to take effect, the firm says. Merrill Lynch is
forecasting an 11.5% increase in earnings for S&amp;P 500 stocks
in the third quarter.
   "I think earnings are going to hit a trough in 1991 in the
second quarter," says Mr. Straszheim. "The history is that
the equity market has turned up at least four months prior to
the trough," which means investors should look for the stock
market to turn up in early March, he says.
   Edward S. Hyman, vice chairman of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell, is so convinced that stocks need lower interest
rates that he has argued for years that "good news" about the
economy is really "bad news" for stocks.
   That's why when he arranges various newspaper clippings on
the front of his weekly strategy newsletter, Mr. Hyman puts
items about rising unemployment and plunging retail sales on
the "good news" side. Articles about rebounding factory
orders and moderating wholesale prices go on the "bad news"
side. He thinks that the stock market "is better served by
the economy getting weaker, resulting in further lowering of
interest rates."
   Mr. Hyman's views on what is and isn't good for stocks
harks back to the economic rebound that began in 1988. "The
economy came back and really started to go up," he recalls.
"Federal funds began a march to 9 3/4% from 8%. The better
the economy got, the worse it was for stocks. Higher interest
rates were more than offsetting any good feeling you got from
earnings."
   Now, of course, the federal funds rate has marched right
back down past 8%, as the Fed has been pushing down
short-term rates.
   That isn't to say Mr. Hyman hasn't been tempted to change
his view of what's good for stocks. After all, at some point
bad news becomes bad news.
   What ultimately will get stocks launched on a big rally,
he says, is for conditions to get so bad that the Fed opens
the monetary floodgates to get the economy back on its feet.
"What really gets the stock market going is when the Fed
injects reserves into the system," he says. "So far, they've
just been holding reserves steady."

   Nissan Prices Up
   A Second Time
   In Four Months

   DETROIT -- Nissan Motor Corp.'s U.S. sales arm, its
profits pressured by a weakened dollar, raised the base
prices on its 1991 cars and trucks for the second time in
four months.
   The latest increase leaves the base prices on some Nissan
models about 12% higher than in September, the last month of
the auto industry's 1990 model year. The company raised
prices of both Nissan and Infiniti brand models.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman for Nissan's Infiniti division attributed
the price increase to the weak dollar, which hurts profits on
vehicles Nissan imports from Japan. Though Nissan builds cars
and trucks in Tennessee, it imports most of the vehicles it
sells in the U.S., and also imports major parts for the
vehicles it builds in America.
   "Nissan as a whole continues to watch the yen-dollar
relationship," the spokeswoman said. "Just when you think
it's stable, the needle moves up and down."
   Nissan's price increase follows similar moves by Honda
Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. Those two Japanese auto
makers last month announced their second price rise of the
1991 model year.
   In September, Nissan appeared to be taking a moderate tack
on 1991 price increases. Most of its 1991 models had
base-price increases of 1.7% to 2.7% over the 1990 versions,
although there were exceptions. The Sentra subcompact, which
had been overhauled and given a peppier engine, had a
base-price increase of $600, or 8.1%.
   But the latest increase means that the cheapest version of
the new Sentra will start at $8,290, up $891, or 12%, from
the price of the 1990 model. It's an aggressive move by
Nissan, because the Sentra is in the most competitive and
price-sensitive segment of the car market.
   The new base price for Nissan's Maxima sedan, the
company's best-selling model in the U.S. this year, stands at
$19,375, an increase of $1,276, or 7%, from the 1990 model.
Previously, Nissan had raised the price of the 1991 Maxima by
only 1.7%, to $18,399 from $18,099 on the 1990 model.
   Nissan's luxury-car Infiniti division raised the price of
its Q45 to $40,000. That's up 2.6% from the initial 1991
price of $39,000, and an increase of 5.3% from the 1990-model
price of $38,000. An Infiniti spokeswoman said about $500 of
Q45's increased base price reflects the imminent increase in
the federal "gas guzzler" tax on cars that don't meet minimum
fuel-economy requirements.
   Infiniti also raised the price of its G20 compact sedan to
$17,750, up 1.4% from the initial base price of $17,500 when
the car was launched last spring.
   Infiniti buyers will have to pay more than just higher
base prices. Nissan said it's raising the standard dealer
destination charge on all Infiniti cars to $385 from $350.
   Nissan has struggled in the U.S. car market this year.
While archrivals Honda and Toyota Motor Corp. have increased
their U.S. sales and market share, Nissan's total U.S. car
sales in the first 11 months of the year dropped 12.3% to
423,370 vehicles. The company's share of the car market also
shrank, to 4.9% from 5.3%. Nissan has, however, increased its
truck sales in the U.S. by 9.4% to 156,779 vehicles.

   Prices of Treasury Bonds Rise in Light Trading
   On Renewed Hopes for Peace in Persian Gulf

   NEW YORK -- Hopes for peace in the Persian Gulf helped
spark a strong Treasury bond rally yesterday, although
trading volume was very light.
   Recovering from a severe four-day slump, prices of
long-term Treasury bonds jumped nearly a point, or almost $10
for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bonds fell to 8.28% from 8.36% on Christmas
Eve.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But corporate bond prices were little changed.
Mortgage-backed bonds rose slightly, and municipals finished
mixed in sluggish trading.
   Short-term interest rates also were mixed. Rates fell
slightly on short-term Treasury bills, while rates soared on
bank certificates of deposit in the secondary, or resale,
markets. Traders said some Japanese banks were paying high
rates to attract short-term money over the next few days to
dress up their balance sheets.
   Many short-term rates may surge even further over the next
few days, traders say, because of a phenomenon known as
"year-end window dressing." This refers to the scramble by
banks and other financial institutions to raise cash in the
money markets to make their balance sheets look more
impressive to investors, depositors and regulators.
   For example, the rate on federal funds, or overnight loans
between banks, sometimes soars around year-end, only to drop
back down shortly after the new year begins. On the final
trading day of 1985, the funds rate jumped to 40% at one
point late in the afternoon. And on the last day of 1986, the
funds rate jumped to 38% at one point, averaging 14.35% for
the day.
   In the bond market, prices of long-term Treasury issues
began surging early in the morning mainly because of Middle
East press reports that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is
preparing a new initiative to present to U.S. officials, and
that a meeting could come soon, several traders here said.
The rally continued even though U.S. officials repeatedly
have said no meeting date has been set.
   Traders also said the rally was bolstered by unexpectedly
strong demand from investors for a record $12.51 billion sale
of new two-year Treasury notes. The average annual yield was
7.32%. Some traders had feared the huge note sale, coupled
with today's auction of new four-year Treasury notes, might
weigh heavily on the markets, driving down bond prices.
   "A surprisingly well-bid auction of two-year Treasury
notes gave a boost to the bond market," said John Lonski,
senior economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc. The
Treasury received bids totaling $38.88 billion for the notes,
or 3.11 times the amount it purchased. He said this figure,
often referred to as the "cover ratio," was up from 2.85 at
the previous auction in November.
   Part of the growing demand for two-year Treasury notes
"can be traced to the increased unwillingness on the part of
banks to lend funds through mortgage and business loan
channels," Mr. Lonski wrote in his daily market summary.
"Unusual bank sensitivity toward credit risk," he wrote, has
led banks to buy short-term Treasury securities, rather than
making some types of loans.
   Traders said the size of yesterday's bond rally was
exaggerated by the lack of trading volume. Many investment
managers already have closed their books for the year.
Trading also was sluggish in the corporate and municipal bond
markets.
   Persian Gulf peace rumors began to fly yesterday after an
Israeli newspaper reported that a date has been set for early
in January for a meeting between Secretary of State James
Baker and Saddam Hussein. After the U.S. State Department
denied that report, Treasury bond prices fell slightly. But
they later climbed again on reports of possible progress in
resolving the crisis.
   "The possibility of war now seems a little less likely
because it seems we may be a little closer to negotiating
with Iraq, and that is what lifted bond prices," said Stuart
G. Hoffman, a vice president at PNC Financial Corp. in
Pittsburgh.
   Some traders called yesterday's rally mainly a technical
rebound, following the sharp four-day drop. During that
period, prices of some issues plunged about 3 1/4 points.
   A government report this morning on November durable goods
orders is widely expected to provide further evidence of the
economy's weakness, leading to further declines in interest
rates next year. According to the average estimate of
economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the
report will show a 2.2% drop in durable goods orders. That
would follow a 3.6% increase in October.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bond prices surged, erasing part of their hefty
losses in the previous four sessions.
   The government's benchmark 30-year bonds, the 8.75% issue
due in 2020, rose to 105 3/32, to yield 8.28%. That was up
sharply from Monday afternoon's price of 104 8/32, where the
yield was 8.36%. The markets were closed Tuesday for
Christmas.
   Treasury bill rates fell, partly reflecting heavy demand
by banks to spruce up their year-end balance sheets. The
discount rate on three-month Treasury bills declined to 6.48%
from 6.54% late Monday. The bondequivalent yield sank to
6.66% from 6.72%.
   Meanwhile, the difference, or spread, between rates on
Treasury bills and 90-day commercial paper has widened
recently. "Worry over the fortunes of banks and other
financial institutions with substantial exposure to the
troubled real estate sector may partly account for the
greater risk premium now being assessed on commercial paper,"
according to Mr. Lonski of Moody's.
   Mr. Lonski said that in mid-December, the rate on 90-day
prime commercial paper was 7.57%, or about 3/4 of a
percentage point over comparable Treasury bills at that time.
Yesterday, the commercial paper rate was about 8%, or around
1 1/2 percentage points above comparable Treasury bills.
   Demand was brisk yesterday for the new two-year Treasury
notes. The notes, auctioned yesterday by the government at an
average annual yield of 7.32%, were quoted late yesterday in
when-issued trading to yield 7.27%.
   Today, the Treasury is scheduled to sell a record $8.5
billion of new four-year notes. In when-issued trading late
yesterday, these notes yielded 7.67%.
   Here are details of the Treasury's sale of two-year notes
yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   Corporate, Junk Securities
                                                                                                       

   Corporate bond prices barely budged yesterday.
   Most investment-grade corporate bonds ended unchanged as
did high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. Trading was extremely
thin as many corporate players were away for the Christmas
holidays and the New Year's celebration.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., in a recent issue of its fixed income
weekly, contended that corporate bonds are looking
increasingly attractive.
   "This quarter, corporate spreads have widened to
compensate investors for the credit risk associated with a
downturn in the business cycle," wrote Thomas Sowanick, chief
fixed income strategist at Merrill Lynch. "But, in many
sectors, spreads have reached levels that . . . overstate the
credit and economic risk."
   The spread, or gap between U.S. Treasury bonds and
corporate bonds is a key gauge of investor confidence. In
recent months, as concerns about the economy have grown,
spreads for corporate bonds have widened.
   But Patricia Zlotin, a senior vice president at
Massachusetts Financial Services Co. in Boston, said she
thinks it's too early to buy corporate bonds. "I think
{yields on} a lot of sectors haven't widened out enough to
make them attractive," she said.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Prices of municipal bonds finished mixed in tired trading,
with some issues off as much as 1/4 point and others up as
much as 1/2 point.
   Among actively traded issues, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 finished 3/8 higher at
98 5/8, with the yield unchanged at Monday's closing level of
7.26%.

   Radio Liberty's Soviet/East European Report recently noted
a curious exchange between a leading Soviet philosopher,
Andranik Migranyan, and the eminent British philosopher Karl
Popper. About two years ago, some 100 Soviet philosophers
boycotted a speech to the World Congress of Philosophy by Mr.
Popper, author of "The Open Society and its Enemies." A year
before that speech, Mr. Migranyan made one of the earliest
calls for creating a genuine civil society in the Soviet
Union. Now, he told Mr. Popper in an interview, the country
needs an "iron hand" because "it's impossible to pass over
from totalitarianism to democracy at a moment's notice."
   No doubt some would sympathize with the notion that the
Soviet government has to regain control of its disorderly
society. However, it's difficult to understand Mr.
Migranyan's logic. The Soviet Union is disorderly because the
bureaucracy's thousands of iron hands won't let go of what
they once held. Giving them more "control" will likely choke
the newborn life out of Soviet civil society.

   S&amp;P and CBOE
   Resolve Dispute
   On Licensing Pact

   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. and the Chicago Board
Options Exchange resolved a squabble over a licensing
arrangement covering S&amp;P stock indexes.
   S&amp;P, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., sued the CBOE in
November, charging the options exchange with breach of a
ten-year licensing pact, signed in 1983, under which the CBOE
was granted exclusive right to use the S&amp;P 100 and S&amp;P 500
indexes as the basis for exchange-traded options.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The CBOE, however, had recently been asserting that its
license to the indexes was broader.
   The dispute began last summer, when the underwriters
withdrew what was to have been an offering of $110 million in
five-year notes, at an interest rate linked to the
appreciation of the S&amp;P 500 index over the life of the bonds.
S&amp;P said at the time that the underwriters withdrew the
offering -- by the country of Denmark -- "apparently due to a
legal disagreement between S&amp;P and the CBOE" over whether the
Chicago exchange has the right to exclusively market any
security with a return based on movement of the indexes.
   S&amp;P and the CBOE said yesterday that they have "signed a
new agreement to extend CBOE's license to trade put and call
options" on the two stock indexes. In addition, they said
they have "agreed to terminate" the litigation that began in
November, under which S&amp;P asked the court to terminate the
1983 contract, or, alternatively, to rule that the pact
doesn't extend to financial instruments other than the
options spelled out in the original agreement.
   An S&amp;P spokeswoman said the new agreement extends CBOE's
rights to use the popular S&amp;P 500 index through 1998. As to
the exchange's perception that its license was broader than
that stated in the original pact, the "mutually satisfactory"
new agreement "did clarify" the relationship, she said. She
declined to elaborate.

   Lock In What With Whom?

   Secretary of State Baker says Eduard Shevardnadze's
resignation shouldn't change U.S.-Soviet cooperation. With
the President scheduled to visit Moscow in February, U.S.
policy is to "lock in" arms-control agreements while the
Gorbachev era lasts.
   But the Shevardnadze resignation, it seems to us, raises
an even more fundamental question: With whom are we
negotiating? With the continued disintegration of the Soviet
Union, and with the collapse of President Gorbachev's de
facto authority even as he demands new paper authority, who
in the Soviet Union can order the Red Army to lay down its
arms?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Recent events give us reason to doubt, indeed, whether
signing an agreement with Mr. Gorbachev can "lock in" the
current regime, let alone all future ones. In November, he
and President Bush signed a treaty paring back conventional
forces in Europe. But the ink was barely dry before the
Soviets began acting like there was no treaty at all. The
Soviets declared 20,000 fewer weapons than NATO thought they
had, and transferred others out of the area covered by the
treaty -- a clear treaty violation. By one account, the
Soviets literally replaced Army uniform patches with navy
markings, since naval "infantry" aren't covered by the
treaty.
   Even before November, one of the largest military
movements in history had already transferred some 60,000
tanks and armored pieces east of the Urals, where they also
won't be covered by the treaty. This may be technically legal
under the treaty, but it doesn't say much for the spirit of
disarmament. Instead of being destroyed along with NATO's
weapons, Soviet tanks will now sit just a few hundred miles
further east.
   The START nuclear-arms talks are also stymied, though
President Bush insists he wants to sign the treaty on his
February trip. The Soviets are balking at a U.S. request to
inspect plants for the rocket motors used to launch ballistic
missiles. These plants are easier for U.S. intelligence to
detect, so cheating would be more difficult. For their part,
the Soviets only want to allow inspection of missile-assembly
plants, which is like inspecting a house without looking at
the furnace. What do Soviet generals have to hide?
   This verification point is critical because the U.S. has
already agreed to the Soviet request not to ban mobile
missiles. In a country (or Russian republic) spanning 11 time
zones, there are plenty of places to stash warheads. Congress
is in the process of killing America's mobile missiles (the
MX and Midgetman), so any Soviet breakout would leave them
far ahead. Throw in concessions the U.S. has already made
limiting our best weapon, the cruise missile, and it's easy
to imagine a treaty that Georgia chameleon Sam Nunn could
pick apart in the Senate.
   And, amazingly, new SS-24 missiles (deployed on rail cars)
and SS-25s (on trucks) continue to roll off the assembly
line. The SS-25 made its first public appearance in a Kremlin
parade in November. Soviet military capabilities remain
formidable, and have continued to grow despite glasnost and
the rest. In particular, the Kremlin retains the world's
largest nuclear arsenal, with warheads still aimed at
Washington and Wyoming, not Baghdad. Leningrad citizens may
be clamoring for food, but the Soviet military seems to have
no problem getting what it needs. Indeed, the military
refuses to release or account for its own strategic food
reserves.
   All of which makes us wonder, what's our rush? So far,
arms control has not reduced the Soviet threat, even with Mr.
Shevardnadze, Mr. Gorbachev and the rest. It is even less
likely to restrain the Soviets if, as Mr. Shevardnadze fears,
its political system evolves back to "dictatorship." Indeed,
agreements may even retard Soviet reform by guaranteeing the
Soviet military a certain "floor" for its military
production. It's possible Mr. Baker wants a treaty for
American political purposes, of course, though it might prove
embarrassing to sign a treaty with a leader who turns around
and declares martial law in the Baltics.
   The Soviets are the ones who should be dying for arms
agreements, not us. They have the economy that's a shambles,
and the empire that's breaking at the seams. Why lock in
anything now? If we've really won the Cold War, why don't we
just declare victory in arms control, too?

   This year's budget agreement was supposed to pretty much
dictate domestic policy for the next five years. Now, only
two months later, there is open warfare over who gets to keep
score on the agreement: the White House's Office of
Management and Budget, as the agreement stipulates, or
Congress. The battle is more than academic; whichever side
wins will hold the commanding heights of public policy for
the near future.
   Last Friday, President Bush sent a letter to House Speaker
Thomas Foley saying that he won't tolerate a recent rule
passed by the House Democratic Caucus, which gives Congress
the right to keep score on when the agreement's automatic
spending cuts kick in. Noting that the rule would undercut
the terms of the budget agreement, President Bush vowed to
veto any bill that substitutes congressional estimates for
the OMB numbers specified in the agreement. If he carries
through on his threat, the ensuing trench warfare could see
President Bush vetoing every other bill that arrives on his
desk.
</LP>

   The rule adopted by the House Democratic Caucus doesn't
directly challenge OMB's legal power to monitor the budget
agreement. Rather, it says that any bill that doesn't use
numbers from the Congressional Budget Office or Joint Tax
Committee can be ruled out of order on the floor of the
House. Unless a majority of Members would then be willing to
vote against the House Democratic leadership, OMB's role in
enforcing the budget agreement would be effectively
eviscerated.
   This latest House Rule clearly violates the spirit of the
budget agreement, and would essentially kill any chance of
passing a capital-gains tax cut. OMB estimates that the Bush
capital-gains proposal would take in $12.5 billion in extra
revenue over six years, a prediction reinforced by the
empirical evidence from all previous cuts in capital-gains
taxes. The Joint Tax Committee, using static revenue models
which assume that lower taxes have no effect on investor
behavior, predict an $11.4 billion loss. If Joint Tax's
estimates are accepted, a capital-gains cut would require
that taxes be raised elsewhere, say, with a surtax on the
"rich" (those earning more than $70,000 a year, in Congress's
eyes).
   Democrats charge that OMB is a creature of the executive
branch, and that sometimes in the past its estimates have
been politically motivated. Perhaps so, but no more so than
its congressional counterparts that routinely use half-baked
econometric models to downplay the high cost of new programs.
The important point is not which side is less "biased." The
budget negotiators were trying to make a more relevant
distinction: They clearly decided to leave the power to
enforce the agreement with OMB, an entity whose bias is for
controlling rather than expanding spending.
   President Bush needs to hold his ground on the budget
agreement. Should he step back from this domestic "line in
the sand" and not use his veto to enforce the budget deal,
he'll have gone a long way toward turning over domestic
policy to Congress. Respect for the executive branch's veto
power might then evaporate so quickly that Congress wouldn't
even need President Bush as a partner in another budget deal.
   Congress could simply pass its own budget, perhaps by a
margin that would convince a weakened executive that his veto
couldn't be sustained. An era of congressionally dominated
government, so strongly resisted throughout the 1980s, would
then be upon the country with no end in sight.

   U.S. Attempts to Withdraw Americans
   From Pro-Iraqi Nations Before Jan. 15

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is attempting to withdraw as many
Americans as possible from four pro-Iraq nations in the
Mideast and Africa.
   American officials fear that if war starts between the
U.S. and Iraq, U.S. citizens in those countries could be
vulnerable to both Iraq-inspired terrorist attacks and to
violence and harassment from local governments or pro-Iraqi
mobs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Separately, a senior U.S. military intelligence officer in
Saudi Arabia predicted that Iraq's leader would defy the
United Nations demand that he pull his army out of Kuwait by
Jan. 15. The U.N. has sanctioned the use of force to oust
Iraqi troops after that date. Air Force Lt. Col. Tom Coury,
appearing at a military news conference in Riyadh, said, "We
presently assess that Saddam Hussein intends to remain in
Kuwait for the long haul."
   Yesterday, the State Department ordered all "nonessential"
U.S. government employees and all dependents of government
employees, to leave Jordan and Sudan. It also urged all other
Americans to leave the two countries, whose governments
sympathize with Iraq, "well before" Jan. 15.
   The U.S. already had been evacuating U.S. employees and
urging private Americans to leave Yemen, a third ally of
Iraq's. Also, the department has authorized -- but not
ordered -- the departure of government dependents and
nonessential government workers from Mauritania.
   The department also has encouraged the departure of
dependents of U.S. government employees from Arab countries
that are friendly to the U.S. but close to the potential
battlefront. They include Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar and the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.
   In Saudi Arabia, Lt. Col. Coury said at the first in a
planned series of military news conferences there that Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein is spending so much of his scarce
resources digging into Kuwait that a peaceful withdrawal is
unlikely.
   "One of the things you look at as an intelligence officer
is how a man is spending his resources," Lt. Col. Coury told
reporters. "You're looking at an economy that's embargoed
right now, and this man is spending tremendous resources to
build defenses in Kuwait and on his western flank," he said.
"And that suggests to me that he has all intentions of
remaining there."
   Lt. Col. Coury also said a chemical-weapons attack on U.S.
and allied forces is "likely" if war breaks out, that Iraq
has installed Silkworm missiles to strike at U.S. ships, and
that it is "very realistic" to expect Iraq to try to attack
Israel if war starts.
   Meanwhile, President Bush is scheduled to return from the
presidential retreat at Camp David today for staff
consultations on the Persian Gulf as well as other routine
business, the White House said. Aides wouldn't identify with
whom the president planned to meet; they said he is expected
to resume his vacation in midafternoon.

   First Soviet Vice President
   Is Conservative Choice;
   Ryzhkov Is Hospitalized

   MOSCOW -- The Soviet Union's top legislative body sat
stunned for several moments when President Mikhail Gorbachev
announced his choice for the country's first vice president:
Gennady Yanayev, a dedicated Communist and Russian by
nationality and a relative unknown.
   Legislators had earlier been shocked by the announcement
Tuesday night that Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov had
suffered a heart attack. Moscow Radio said late Wednesday
that Mr. Ryzhkov's condition was worsening.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In his surprise selection of Mr. Yanayev, the 53-year-old
secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee and
head of the Communists' faction in the Congress of People's
Deputies, Mr. Gorbachev dashed expectations that his choice
would be calculated to smooth over at least some of the
nation's complex problems, such as national separatism,
economic reform, and political restructuring.
   Instead, Mr. Yanayev provides a conservative voice on all
three counts. As a Russian, he fails to answer hopes that Mr.
Gorbachev would select a leader of an independence-minded
republic to help build a nation of equal and sovereign member
republics. As a clear opponent of radical economic reform,
Mr. Yanayev is unlikely to add new energy to the hesitant
drive toward a market economy. And as a longtime Communist
bureaucrat, he does little to help promote the nation's
fledgling multiparty system or the separation of government
and party that Mr. Gorbachev has said he supports.
   "I am a convinced Communist to the depths of my soul," Mr.
Yanayev told the Congress. "My main fight will be against
political Bacchanalia and vandalism, but by using democratic
means, not by repression."
   The Congress must confirm Mr. Yanayev's appointment and
the result of the vote may not be declared until this
morning. Many delegates said they have no doubt he would be
approved, as have all significant proposals by President
Gorbachev at the Congress so far.
   Mr. Gorbachev defended his choice with irritation against
a series of charged questions from the floor. "He is a man of
strong principles, an active supporter of perestroika," Mr.
Gorbachev said. Names that had been circulated as possible
candidates for vice president included such reformers as
Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Leningrad Mayor
Anatoli Sobchak and Eduard Shevardnadze, the exiting foreign
minister whom Mr. Gorbachev had earlier said he intended to
appoint.
   Asked how he explained the apparent gap between the
experience and philosophies of Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr.
Yanayev, Mr. Gorbachev argued that the two had a lot in
common. Both are hard workers, he said, with long
international experience. Mr. Yanayev has served on the
party's international committee, for years pursuing contacts
primarily with Socialist-bloc countries.
   But critics said Mr. Gorbachev's choice simply showed his
own real conservatism. "As long as {Mr. Yanayev} believes the
Soviet Union should be saved as the Russian empire and that
socialism can work, he's a conservative to me," said Algis
Chekuolis, a Lithuanian legislator who is attending the
Congress as an observer because his republic is officially
boycotting its deliberations.
   Many deputies felt Mr. Gorbachev's main goal was to pick
someone who would be a solid ally, ready to accept and
support any ideas the president puts forth, and that Mr.
Yanayev filled that bill.
   The selection of vice president was Mr. Gorbachev's first
personnel appointment in a new government structure and
system of executive power that the Congress approved
Wednesday morning. Attention is now focused on who will be
selected to fill other key posts such as foreign minister and
prime minister.
   Mr. Shevardnadze stunned the Congress last week when he
resigned as foreign minister, warning that the new
presidential powers could lead ultimately to a legal
dictatorship.
   As for the post of prime minister, few deputies expect Mr.
Ryzhkov, who has been under attack for months for his
conservative economic policies, to return to an active
political position following his heart attack. Even before he
was hospitalized it was widely expected that he would be
replaced as premier after five years in the post.
   Although the role of vice president under the new
structure won't supercede that of prime minsiter, in his
comments Wednesday, Mr. Yanayev appeared to be an ideological
brother to Mr. Ryzhkov.
   Mr. Yanayev, who worked his way up through the official
labor union and the Communist youth organization, said he was
committed to pursuing perestroika, of which an important
element will be social welfare protection for workers. "If we
take the shock approach to economic reform, more than a
million people will be unemployed," Mr. Yanayev told
deputies.
   Under the new government structure, it isn't clear yet
what role the new vice president will play. He will, however,
sit as a member of the revised Federation Council, an
organization made up of leaders of republics and other
regions that is supposed to determine national and
international policy and oversee its implementation in the
republics.

   Short Interest

SHORT SALES AND SHORT INTEREST (SHO)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Total short interest in over-the-counter
stocks moved down in the latest month after leaping in the
prior month to record levels.
   Short interest among the largest OTC stocks fell back 2.3%
for the month through mid-December, and the level among
smaller issues fell 5.4%. Combined short interest for large
and small OTC issues was nearly 329 million shares, down from
the record volume of 342.5 million originally reported for
the prior month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet been
purchased for return to lenders.
   First Executive Corp. led the list of companies showing
short interest, with nearly 5.8 million shares. But short
interest in the insurance company's shares actually declined
5% from November. First Executive invested heavily in junk
bonds over several years, and has been struggling with a weak
portfolio.
   Significant increases in short positions occurred in
several computer and technology issues -- Oracle Systems
Corp., Adobe Systems Inc. and Apple Computer Inc. Short
interest in Apple shares had doubled in the mid-November
month, as investors feared a bad earnings report. But more
recently the stock had rebounded; the past month's increase
suggests further betting on another slide in the shares.
Semiconductor and disk-drive issues generally have been under
selling pressure.
   The biggest single volume increase was in Medco
Containment Services Inc., a provider of prescription-by-mail
services for pharmaceuticals. It saw short interest climb to
2.3 million shares from 1.2 million the month earlier. Also,
New England Critical Care Inc.'s short interest rose to 1.4
million shares from 834,000 a month earlier. The company
provides home-based therapy services.
   Some stock fund managers have been trimming their
portfolios of health-care stocks, but they still see these
kinds of companies as a relative haven in hard economic
times.
   Among issues with decreasing short interest volumes, MCI
Communications Corp. led with an 875,000-share drop to a
total of 1.3 million. The company's stock has fallen
substantially in recent months, and analysts see some
bottoming-out of the decline.
   Although a substantial short position reflects heavy
speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors
consider an increase in short interest bullish because the
borrowed shares eventually must be bought back.
   And some short interest doesn't reflect any opinion on the
stock at all but shows up as part of another strategy, such
as arbitrage or dividend capture.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, the
self-regulatory agency that operates the Nasdaq computerized
system on which more than 4,300 OTC issues trade, compiles
short interest data in two categories: the approximately
two-thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks that trade
on the National Market System; and the other, generally
smaller stocks that don't.
   The NASD reported that short interest in 2,258 National
Market System issues, the largest OTC stocks, totaled 292.6
million shares at mid-December, down from a revised 299.4
million in mid-November among 2,267 shares.
   Short interest in 1,181 smaller securities traded on
Nasdaq declined to 36.3 million shares for December from a
revised 38.3 million for November among 1,197 issues.
   The National Market System's short-interest ratio at
mid-December fell to 3.12 from 3.29 a month earlier, while
the short-interest ratio for other OTC issues declined to
1.29 from 1.51 a month earlier.
   The ratio -- the number of trading days at the market's
average daily trading volume that would be required to
convert the total short interest position -- is a measure of
negative trader sentiment. Some analysts suggest, however,
that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because
options and other products can be used to hedge short
positions.

   A small-business executive hopes to save low-cost,
American-made cameras from extinction; unscrupulous
storekeepers cheat electronics consumers; a small firm banks
on a windfall, thanks to Saddam Hussein.
   Subjects such as these -- covered by The Wall Street
Journal during 1990 -- illustrate the trials and triumphs of
entrepreneurs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With 1991 approaching, reporters made progress reports on
some of the people and companies featured this year. Here are
their findings:
   FOR KEYSTONE CAMERA, the financial picture has gotten
bleaker.
   In July, Keystone Camera Products Corp., Clifton, N.J.,
was struggling to remain the last U.S. maker of under-$50
cameras. Besieged by price-cutting competitors in Asia,
Keystone had reported losses for five consecutive years and
defaulted on its loans.
   "Everyone else said we were finished," says Myron Berman,
chairman of Keystone since last January. Since July, the
company has introduced two cameras designed to hold down
costs. Where Keystone's old lines were selling at break-even,
Mr. Berman says profit margins on the new cameras should run
30% or more. But despite concessions from lenders and
suppliers, Mr. Berman still needs to raise $5 million to
shore up the company's finances.
   He and a partner already have invested $15 million in
Keystone, which reported a net loss of $2 million for the
third quarter. "We'd put in more," Mr. Berman says, "but
that's all we've got."

   STORM CLOUDS in the Gulf are aiding Survival Technology
Inc.
   In August, the Bethesda, Md., company, the sole U.S. maker
of battlefield antidote kits to counter nerve gas, was
looking for a windfall in the Middle East. Almost overnight,
the Pentagon doubled a $1 million order.
   Since August, the Defense Department has ordered $16.6
million of the company's nerve-gas antidote kits. Meanwhile,
the company's sales of nonmilitary products have also
increased. The company's St. Louis manufacturing plant is now
running around-the-clock six days a week.
   Although the company recorded a $361,000 net loss for the
fiscal year ended July 31, its operations had turned
profitable even before the surge in orders. Now Survival
Technology expects to be profitable for fiscal 1991, says
James H. Miller, chief executive officer.

   A PUBLIC OFFERING for American Waste Services Inc. got off
the scrap heap.
   In late September, investors were balking at the
Youngstown, Ohio, waste-disposal company's lofty plans to go
public at $14 to $17 a share. Investors worried about the
lackluster stock market, the poor performance of other
waste-related stocks, and American Waste's sought-after
multiple: some 100 times 1989 pro-forma share earnings.
   But American Waste did go public in October, through
underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., selling six million
shares at $10 each. While that was a sharp drop from the
initial expectations, pre-existing shareholders weren't
complaining. "The offering went fine, and the company's
moving along real well," says Oliver Nicklin, president of
First Analysis Corp., a Chicago investment firm that had
bought American Waste shares at $1.04, on average. The shares
closed unchanged yesterday in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading at $11.75.

   THAT'S NOT SANTA visiting these ripoff retailers of
electronics in New York City.
   It's Mark Green, the city's commissioner of consumer
affairs, who says he's intensifying a crackdown announced in
July against unscrupulous stores. According to this
newspaper's October report, the city has been fighting a
losing battle against such stores for decades.
   But this month, Mr. Green ordered a two-day enforcement
sweep. Nine stores were charged with illegally
misrepresenting used items as new; five others were charged
with using illegal sales tactics, such as "bait-and-switch"
schemes. Those five each face fines of more than $50,000.
Several of the companies declined to comment on the charges;
others couldn't be reached. At one concern, a manager hung up
on a reporter seeking a statement.
   Says Mr. Green, "We're making a list and checking it
twice, for electronic stores who haven't been nice."

   MOVIEFONE IS RINGING coast to coast, despite problems that
almost put the service on hold.
   Los Angeles entrepreneur J. Russell Leatherman, 28 years
old, and his partners in PromoFone Inc. found themselves
battling with the Los Angeles Times last year when it refused
to carry ads for their new phone-in theater guide, in part
because it competed with the newspaper for movie ads.
   After some wrangling with the Times, the partners turned
to such alternatives as billboards, bus cards and
cross-promotions with a local radio station to plug their
777-FILM line, called MovieFone. The strategy worked, and the
service has since expanded to the New York area, San
Francisco, Boston and Miami. MovieFone gets between 130,000
and 150,000 calls a week now, up from just 30,000 a year ago.
   The partners are selling 15-second commercial spots on the
phone line; among the takers are Walt Disney Co., Twentieth
Century Fox and Columbia Pictures. "We're sold out for most
of next year," Mr. Leatherman says. In addition, the studios
have been buying demographic information that the service
collects from callers. All of which helped PromoFone reap
$1.5 million in revenue in 1990. Mr. Leatherman hopes to see
the first profits on his company's $2.5 million investment in
the next two to three years.

   FOR THESE NURSES, moves into their own businesses are
paying off.
   Laura Gasparis Vonfrolio -- one of seven
nurse-entrepreneurs covered in an August article -- has
stepped up her attack on the medical establishment. She has
just put on sale "Nurse Abuse," a new book of essays on
nurses' grievances.
   She's also planning a quarterly magazine named Revolution:
the Journal of Nurse Empowerment. A regular feature will be
the War Stories section, with nurses recounting the outrages
committed against them by doctors and hospital
administrators. "We'll have an analysis of each story by a
nurse-psychiatrist, a nurse-lawyer and a pro-nurse
administrator -- if we can find one," she says.
   Meanwhile, inventor Nancy Gorski, a former operating-room
nurse, is in an exultant mood. Her 11 years of
entrepreneurial toil will pay off in a big way in January,
she says. The disposable latex sheath that her Gorsk Inc.
developed for anesthesiologists' laryngoscope blades will
finally hit the market. More important, she will sign a
contract giving multinational rights to sell a special
receptacle she designed for discarded surgical sponges. She
says her royalties are expected to total several hundred
thousand dollars next year. She adds: "Suddenly, I'm a hot
item. Isn't that great?"

   Fame was fleeting.
   A once-promising celebrity magazine, Fame shut its doors
last week after two years. Its founder and publisher, Steven
Greenberg, said he decided to close the magazine after
estimating that advertising pages for the monthly wouldn't
grow in 1991 and that he needed to invest heavily to increase
the magazine's circulation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An executive at the magazine said Mr. Greenberg spent more
than $10 million on the start-up and operation of Fame. In an
interview, Mr. Greenberg said that in the last year he had
been contacted by potential buyers of a part interest in the
magazine. There was no sale, however, because no agreement
could be reached on the size of needed future investments, he
said.
   There is a remote chance that Fame could be brought back
to life by its editor in chief, Gael Love. Mr. Greenberg said
Ms. Love has begun discussions with outside investors who may
be interested in buying the magazine.
   In a difficult publishing climate, the folding of Fame
isn't considered a surprise, particularly because it
published independently of any other magazine titles. Most of
the magazines that have gone out of business in 1990
published independently or were part of small publishing
groups. Fame had a staff of about 45, based in New York and
Los Angeles.
   "We would have had a market in the 1980s, but the '80s are
over," Mr. Greenberg said. "In 1991, many magazines are going
to look as thin as pamphlets."
   America's seemingly endless fascination with celebrities
and movie stars made Fame's magazine category a relatively
sturdy one. Fame's recent cover subjects included Warren
Beatty, Cybill Shepherd and Tom Hanks, and the last issue in
December carried stories on composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's
love affairs and a murder in Beverly Hills.
   Though Fame was noteworthy for sensational stories, its
circulation never exceeded 200,000 after its launch in 1988.
Mr. Greenberg said he had expected the magazine to make a
profit in 1991, but that plan was derailed by the country's
general economic slowdown, which has resulted in sharply
smaller advertising budgets for magazines and other media.

   RADIO: Minnesota Public Radio has agreed to purchase Twin
Cities station WLOL 99.5 FM from Emmis Broadcasting Co. for
$12 million. MPR, a nonprofit, noncommercial public
broadcasting organization, said it will move its KSJN 91.1
classical music format to 99.5 -- which offers a clearer,
higher quality signal. MPR's news and information format,
currently broadcast on KNOW 1330 AM, will then move to 91.1,
where it will broadcast under increased wattage. Emmis is a
closely held Indianapolis broadcasting concern.

   Pennzoil Raises
   Its Chevron Stake
   To 9.4% From 9%

   HOUSTON -- Pennzoil Co. said it raised its stake in
Chevron Corp. to 9.4% from 9% and has received a ruling from
the Internal Revenue Service that would enable it to buy more
shares through May 31 if it chooses.
   Both Pennzoil and Chevron, based in San Francisco, are oil
companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Pennzoil
said it acquired an additional 1.3 million Chevron shares for
$89 million as of yesterday. Pennzoil began making its latest
purchases on Dec. 3, right after the Federal Trade Commission
said it would allow Pennzoil to acquire more.
   In its previous government filings, Pennzoil said it would
use the $2.6 billion of proceeds from its 1988 legal
settlement with Texaco Inc. to buy just under 10% of
Chevron's shares. The 10% threshold triggers a variety of
Chevron's anti-takeover provisions. To date, Pennzoil has
spent about $2.2 billion amassing its Chevron stake.
   Pennzoil's settlement with Texaco ended four years of
litigation in which a court found that Texaco had improperly
interfered with Pennzoil's acquisition of a portion of Getty.
   For the latest purchases, Pennzoil paid an average price
of $69.75 a share.
   Chevron closed yesterday at $73.25, up $2, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Pennzoil finished at $65,
up $1.375, also on the Big Board.
   Pennzoil said the IRS on Monday granted a company request
extending the time for investment of the Texaco settlement
under a tax theory Pennzoil hopes will allow it to delay
taxes on the money. A Pennzoil spokesman said it asked for
the extension "because of delays in obtaining clearance from
the FTC for the purchases." The period was to expire at year
end but now will continue to May 31.
   Pennzoil seeks to qualify its Chevron investment as
property "similar or related in service or use to" the
contractual interest it had in Getty Oil Co. That agreement
was the subject of Pennzoil's litigation with Texaco. On
Pennzoil's tax returns, the company has been treating the
Texaco settlement proceeds as compensation for the
involuntary conversion of property. Under Pennzoil's tax
theory, so far untested, such proceeds would be excludable
from taxable income if they're used to acquire property
similar or related to its interest in Getty.
   In its SEC filing, Pennzoil said its tax position "will be
subject to review by the IRS in due course." The company
spokesman declined to comment on whether Pennzoil views the
IRS extension as an indication that the agency would also
regard Pennzoil's tax plan favorably.
   Pennzoil accumulated the bulk of its Chevron shares in
1989 and has described its stake as "a long-term investment,"
maintaining it doesn't want to take over the company. But
Chevron has alleged in a number of court actions that
Pennzoil misstated its intentions and may try to take over
the company. So far Chevron hasn't received any support from
the courts.

   JAPAN'S UNION MEMBERS

   Union members in Japan increased this year for the first
time in eight years, but their share in the total labor force
dropped to the lowest level since the end of the war,
according to a survey released by the Labor Ministry.
   Ministry officials said union membership grew 37,000 at
the end of last June from a year earlier to 12.27 million,
putting an end to a downtrend that started in 1983. However,
union members accounted for 25.2% of the country's entire
labor force, down 0.7 percentage point from the previous year
and the lowest level in the postwar era, officials noted.
   Ministry officials ascribed the decline to an expanding
population of workers as a result of Japan's sustained
economic growth. The long-lasting economic expansion, now in
its 49th month, has brought more women and part-time workers
into the labor market, they said. This influx grew faster
than the number of workers joining labor unions, they
explained.
   Ministry officials said, at the same time, that the number
of labor unions throughout the country dropped 403 to 72,202
at the end of June.
                                                                                                       

   OECD'S JOBLESS OUTLOOK
                                                                                                       

   The unemployment rate among the 24 members of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development held
steady in October from September at 6.1% of the work force,
the OECD said. But the group of industrialized nations said
initial data for November suggest that "the recent period of
stability has come to an end: The unemployment rate rose in
all six countries for which data are available."

   EXPANDING BARAJAS AIRPORT
                                                                                                       

   Madrid's Barajas International Airport is to triple its
terminal space and add three runways under a
200-billion-peseta ($2.03 billion) expansion plan. Spain's
Transport Minister Jose Barrionuevo said the three-phase
plan, expected to end in 2030, includes a major increase in
parking space and access to downtown Madrid by high-speed
train and superhighway. The airport is to accommodate up to
80 million passengers a year; it now handles 16 million,
sixth among European airports.
                                                                                                       

   MAZDA PENALIZES EXECUTIVES
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. will cut the salaries of
Chairman Kenichi Yamamoto and 17 other executives by 5% to
10% for 1991's first three months. The cuts were announced
one day after the Transport Ministry warned Mazda to pay
stricter attention to the safety of its cars. The ministry
earlier investigated allegations that Mazda has been
replacing defective parts during routine maintenance without
recalling the cars or notifying the government. After the
warning, Madza notified the ministry that it would recall
3,498 Luce model passenger cars produced between Aug. 8,
1986, and Jan. 31, 1987, because of switch defects. None of
the cars went to the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   BRAZIL STUDIES TAX CUTS ON AUTOS
                                                                                                       

   Brazil is studying tax cuts and legal action to force the
nation's foreign-owned auto makers to curb "abusive prices,"
the Economy Ministry said. The move would force the companies
"to compete with less expensive and better-made cars," a
ministry spokesman said. Imports of foreign cars now are
subject to a 40% tax. "We are studying the possibility of
lowering this tax or eliminating it altogether," the
spokesman said.
                                                                                                       

   RECORD EXPENSE SPENDING
                                                                                                       

   Expense-account spending by Japanese corporate executives
totaled a record $36.53 billion between February 1989 and
January 1990, according to the annual report of the National
Tax Administration Agency. The agency said the figure was
9.4% higher than the previous year's, which had been the
record. Company expense-account spending is tax-deductible in
Japan.
                                                                                                       

   CHANGING ALBANIA
                                                                                                       

   Albania's state bank has joined a Swiss company to form
the first bank with foreign capital in the communist country,
the state news agency ATA said.
   ATA said the bank would be known as Iliria Bank and would
start trading in January in Tirana. It named the partners as
the Albanian State Bank for Relations with Foreign Countries
and a Swiss company, Iliria Holding S.A. It didn't state
their respective stakes or say how much capital was involved.
   Earlier this year, Albania's President Ramiz Alia lifted
measures imposed by his predecessor, the late Stalinist
leader Enver Hoxha, that made it a crime to seek foreign
investment or loans for the long-isolated Balkan state.
   ATA said the new bank would help attract foreign capital
for construction projects in such areas of the economy as
light industry, foodstuffs, building materials,
electromechanics and tourism.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   A Japanese district court ordered the city of Iwaki to pay
$81,000 in compensation to the family of a 14-year-old
student who committed suicide after being bullied by his
classmates. "The main cause of the suicide was bullying, and
the school failed to fully discharge its duty of protecting
and superintending {students}," a Japanese news agency quoted
the presiding judge as saying. . . . Robert Fitzpatrick,
president of Euro Disneyland, said the $3 billion theme park
near Paris would open on schedule in early 1992.

   Subsidy of Medical Benefits
   By Ex-Parent Company
   Is Welcome Holiday Gift

   NEW YORK -- ITT Corp. is showing Western Union Corp., or
what is left of it, that it knows a thing or two about
holiday spirit.
   Cheating bankruptcy and struggling under a mountain of
debt, Western Union and its management team, led by New York
financier Bennett S. LeBow, told 9,000 company retirees in
late November that they would have to make significantly
larger payments to their retiree medical fund to keep their
benefits intact.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Payments typically went up two to three times and in some
cases more than that, depending on the medical options they
had," said a Western Union spokesman. "So if you were, say,
paying $55 a month, now you had to pay something like $125 or
more."
   About 225 of these retired workers were longtime former
employees of ITT's World Communications international telex
business, which ITT sold to Western Union in 1987.
   In mid-December, when one irate former ITT employee
complained that ITT had sold its former workers down the
river to a company that was killing his benefits, ITT stepped
in. It offered to make up 85% of the difference between what
the former ITT workers had been paying into their medical
plan and the amount that Mr. LeBow and his managers were now
demanding -- at least during 1991.
   Why? "Our contributions will range from $10 a month for
some employees to about $500," said an ITT spokesman.
"Western Union said the {retirees} would have to pay so many
hundreds of dollars a month to keep the coverage. These were
long-service employees and we were concerned that they have
the right coverage. It was the right thing to do."
   But a Western Union spokesman defended the company's
position. "This company has a six-to-one ratio of retirees to
active workers. We very reluctantly had to reduce our subsidy
to the plan because of the company's impaired financial
condition."
   Since taking over Western Union in late 1987 in a deal
that was touted as a bid to save Western Union, Mr. LeBow and
his managers have sold off numerous Western Union operations,
fired half its work force and slashed pension and other
benefits to those that still work at the almost 140-year-old
communications company.
   During the same period, however, the LeBow rescue team has
prospered with steadily increasing compensation. Mr. LeBow
alone has been drawing a $2.4 million annual management fee,
including $50,000 per month for overhead expenses. And this
year, President Robert Amman and Chief Financial Officer
Stewart J. Paperin received raises of 23% and 26%,
respectively, not counting bonuses. Their medical benefits
remain intact.
   Mr. LeBow will no longer draw that management fee under a
deal worked out with the company's bondholders as one
condition for accepting an exchange offer aimed at
restructuring the company's $530 million in junk-bond debt.

   NEW YORK -- "The Godfather Part III" brought in total box
office receipts of $6,387,271 on Tuesday, the film's opening
day, to achieve the biggest Christmas day gross in history.
   Paramount Pictures, a unit of Paramount Communications
Corp., said the movie, directed by Francis Ford Coppola,
grossed a per-screen average of $3,509 on 1,820 screens in
the U.S. and Canada.

   Paramount noted the biggest individual theater receipts
were in several cinema houses in the Los Angeles area, one in
New York and others in Washington, Chicago and Honolulu. But
the biggest single gross was in San Jose, Calif., with more
than $41,000 for a day's showings.
   The first two movies in the trilogy, "The Godfather"
(1972) and "The Godfather Part II" (1974), were among the
biggest money-makers in movie history. Each film won the
Academy Award for best picture.

holiday-thinned market that showed only a mild interest in
position-squaring.

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze late last week.
The German currency is believed to be the most vulnerable
among major currencies to instability in the Soviet Union.
   Nevertheless, the greenback still has firm support,
traders said, because of the market's apprehension about the
Mideast stalemate. The dollar, which is perceived as a safe
investment, traditionally attracts buyers in times of
uncertainty.
   A statement issued yesterday by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein that the deposed Kuwaiti rulers never again will rule
in Kuwait was interpreted as confirmation that he has no
intention of complying with the U.N. Security Council's Nov.
29 resolution ordering an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait by
Jan. 15, said Thomas Palladino, a trader at Oesterreichische
Laenderbank in New York.
   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5368
marks, up from its Tokyo close Wednesday of 1.5330 marks. The
U.S. currency was changing hands at 136.25 yen, level with
its Tokyo close Wednesday. Sterling was trading at $1.8823,
up from $1.8750.
   In Tokyo early Thursday, the dollar was trading at 136.85
yen.
   Even a report in an Israeli newspaper indicating that U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III would likely meet
Saddam Hussein in Baghdad on Jan. 9 failed to encourage
dollar sellers. The State Department later denied that any
date had been set for negotiations. Furthermore, traders
noted, even if the two men did meet on Jan. 9, it was hardly
feasible that a withdrawal by Jan. 15 could be negotiated.
   News that British, Australian and U.S. Marines seized an
Iraqi freighter before it entered the Persian Gulf kept the
attention of what few participants there were focused on the
Mideast.
   Concern over the Soviet situation seems to have abated
somewhat, allowing traders to buy back some mark positions.
After mulling over the consequences of Mr. Shevardnadze's
resignation, participants seem to be regarding the mark
sell-off as somewhat overdone, traders said.
   Among the developments suggesting that panic over the
future of Mikhail Gorbachev's rule might have been
unwarranted, was news that Mr. Gorbachev won sweeping new
powers over a reorganized executive branch as Parliament
agreed to create a new vice presidency and cabinet under his
direct control.
   The focus of the market's political jitters has now
shifted to Baghdad rather than Moscow, said Erik Lehtis,
assistant vice president at Credit Agricole in New York.
   But traders emphasized that the thinness of the market
made rate movements unreliable benchmarks, and that the
predominant impulse was to ignore the market as much as
possible. Traders were reluctant to establish any new
positions in the illiquid market and are waiting for Jan. 2
to get a real sense of where the market wants rates to be.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $385.60 an ounce, up $3.10. Estimated
volume was 1.9 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$384.88 an ounce.

   RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- Patrick Williams knew the downturn
had arrived when his business jumped 50% last month from a
year earlier.
   He runs the unemployment office.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're filing more claims now than we ever have before,"
says Mr. Williams, whose lobby has been so crowded lately
with laid-off construction and factory workers that his staff
is processing them in groups rather than individually.
   Growing unemployment lines may be commonplace in much of
the country, but they are shocking to California's
fastest-growing region, the self-proclaimed "Inland Empire"
of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Here, population
soared an astonishing 60% in the past decade as Los Angelenos
migrated eastward in search of reasonably priced housing, and
jobs followed. With 2.5 million people now living in the
region, the phone company is considering giving it its own
area code.
   Rapid growth has driven California out of -- or even
around -- past slumps. But this time, the growth engine is
stalling.
   "I'm not so sure we can rely on the Golden State's golden
past to carry us through this recession," says Riverside
County Supervisor Kay Ceniceros, who worries that the local
economy has become too dependent on a single industry,
construction.
   Although building is slumping throughout California, the
effects of the slide are most pronounced in the Inland
Empire, which was transformed almost overnight into
sprawling, tile-roofed suburbias replete with strip malls and
drive-through restaurants.
   The region's roots were in agriculture. The navel orange
was developed in Riverside, and California's first vineyard
was in nearby Ontario. The area also was known for its
transportation arteries: The Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe cut
through here, and famous Route 66 winds through San
Bernardino on its way to Chicago. The Hollywood set helped
establish the Inland Empire as a weekend spot, with sunning
in Palm Springs and skiing in the mountain resorts of Lake
Arrowhead and Big Bear.
   But not until the 1980s, when the price of much California
real estate shot into the stratosphere, did the Inland Empire
take off. Just as Orange County blossomed in the 1970s as a
bedroom community of Los Angeles, this area mushroomed in the
1980s. Moreno Valley, a suburb east of Riverside with 116,000
people, had scarcely any inhabitants a decade ago.
   About 10% of the workers in the Inland Empire -- some
71,000 people -- are in construction, and they are suffering
the most. The number of building permits for new houses has
dropped more than 30% from 1989, and home sales have fallen
an equal amount. Layoffs in construction and related
industries helped lift the region's unemployment rate to 7.1%
in October, well above the statewide rate of 6% and above the
national rate as well.
   "I remember going to meetings of office-park developers in
other parts of the country and hearing how bad things were
going. But we just didn't see it," says Willard W. "Skip"
Morris, president of a Chevron Corp. unit that has been
transforming the old Ontario Motor Speedway into a business
and housing development. "It wasn't until the early part of
this year that we saw we'd have many of the same types of
problems here."
   Joseph L. Borrie, a Riverside bankruptcy attorney, has
been sought out by more and more small-business owners in
recent weeks. "I just had four separate furniture stores file
within a week and a half of one another, and they were all
established businesses," he says. "I think there's going to
be a horrible flood of filings after the holidays."
   Growth in the Inland Empire hasn't stopped, of course; it
has just slowed down. In fact, economists say the region is
probably the best-positioned in Southern California to
weather a recession. "Compared with the rest of the state and
the nation, the outlook for the Riverside-San Bernardino
metropolitan area is highly positive," says Phillip Vincent,
a First Interstate Bancorp economist.
   Wages here are well below those of Los Angeles and Orange
counties -- as much as 35% lower, according to one survey --
and that, along with the ample supply of jobseekers, will
keep new businesses coming in. With the average home price of
$146,255 in November -- compared with $225,600 in Los Angeles
and $239,671 in Orange County -- growth will eventually pick
up again. Even with the drop in construction, some 25,000
single-family homes were built here this year, more than in
any other metropolitan area in the nation.
   "The Inland Empire will be the last area to go into the
recession and the first to come out," boasts Inland Empire
Economic Council President Steve Pon-Tell.
   Nonetheless, the prospect of being first out offers little
comfort to people now caught in the undertow.
   "Basically, the name of the game is survival," says Donald
Billetts, who has slashed the staff at his J.D. Trim
finished-carpentry firm in Chino to 45 from 70 in the past
year to cope with a 50% drop in new business. "My banker
asked what my bottom line will be this year. I told him if
I'm lucky, it'll be zero."
   Peter Olah has laid off more than half the staff of his
excavation company in Upland and briefly considered closing
down temporarily. Steven Alexander, executive vice president
of Superior Electrical Contractors in Redlands, had to slash
his staff to 45 from 150 and is moving his headquarters to an
old house to save on rent. And Paul Friedman had to stop
building a 462-unit housing tract in Lake Elsinore when
financing dried up.
   "Of our four lenders, one was taken over by the RTC {the
federal Resolution Trust Corp.}, one filed for Chapter 11,
the third went out of business just as they were processing
our loan, and the fourth was taken over by another company
that wouldn't lend," Mr. Friedman complains.
   Without the $4 million needed to start construction, his
projected community is nothing more than rows of graded lots
gouged out of a lifeless hillside. Mr. Friedman also is
having trouble paying subcontractors. "We normally pay them
in 30 days or less," he says. "Now we're double that. And
we're some of the good guys."
   Like shockwaves from the San Andreas fault, which bisects
the region, the homebuilding slump has jolted the local
economy, leveling some businesses while sparing others. "A
disproportionately large percentage of the economy is being
affected by the slowdown in construction, whether you sell
drapes, build cabinets or do landscaping," says Stephen
Albright, president of a nonprofit company that tries to
bring employers into the Riverside area.
   The downturn has been particularly hard on the Deleo
family. Joe Deleo makes clay roof tiles at a small factory in
Lake Elsinore. Business "stinks," the gruff, 76-year-old
family patriarch says. He has fired his sales staff and may
have to idle one of the plant's two kilns. Fifteen miles up
the road, Mr. Deleo's son and grandson are watching their
Corona Clay Co. crumble. Brick and pipe makers have stopped
ordering clay, contractors are failing to pay for orders
filled months ago, and the company laid off about 20 workers.
   Surprisingly, retailers here don't seem to be suffering
nearly as much as those elsewhere in the country, partly
because new shopping centers haven't been added as fast as
the population has grown. Harris Co., a San Bernardino
department-store chain with eight locations, is still posting
"healthy increases" in sales, says Geoff Engel, a vice
president.
   In addition, companies that specialize in heavy
construction, such as San Bernardino-based Kasler Corp., are
benefiting from much-needed additions to local roads and
similar projects. And industrial and commercial developers
haven't been as hard hit as homebuilders. Sales and leasing
of industrial space in the third quarter totaled 4.3 million
square feet, up from 2.8 million a year earlier.
   Demand is still strong for the lowest-priced homes, which
sell for under $100,000 in Victorville and Adelanto, some 90
miles from downtown Los Angeles. H. Lawrence Webb, who
oversees Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp.'s activities in the
Inland Empire, says that although move-up housing is a tough
sell, "affordable housing is selling well."
   However, not all those buying cheaper housing are
first-time buyers. Robert Chamberlain, relocation coordinator
for Associated Van &amp; Storage in San Bernardino, says, "People
are downgrading their homes, moving from a $200,000 house to
a $150,000 house." He says business has been brisk lately
because "our busiest times are during recessions. It's kind
of sad, but that's the way it is."
   Manufacturers here are also feeling the pinch. The Inland
Empire is a center for recreational-vehicle and mobile-home
manufacturers, which have been suffering from a sales slump.
Riverside-based Fleetwood Enterprises Inc., which employs
2,000 people here, is cutting its workers' hours and giving
them "a little more time off" during the holidays, after
earnings in its Oct. 28 quarter fell 50%. Other RV firms are
laying off hundreds of employees.
   Defense and military workers have it tough, too. General
Dynamics Corp. will lay off 2,800 missile-plant employees in
the area over the next year. Other defense contractors are
considering cuts, and newer plants in the Inland Empire could
be hit harder than older ones in Los Angeles and Orange
counties, First Interstate's Mr. Vincent says.
   Looming on the horizon, the Air Force plans to close
Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino and George Air Force
Base near Victorville by mid-decade, wiping out as many as
12,000 civilian and military jobs. And that doesn't include
the three local jobs that economists say could be lost for
every one at the bases.
   The blow could be softened if the Air Force selects March
Air Force Base in nearby Moreno Valley for its Space Systems
Division, bringing in 7,500 jobs and allowing another 2,500
employees to keep working at Norton. Last summer, moreover,
Lockheed Corp. agreed to locate part of its
commercial-airplane maintenance business to a hangar on the
base.
   Local officials hope that, with retraining, some laid-off
aerospace workers can find other manufacturing jobs. "We
still have new companies moving in," says John Mooney,
director of Ontario's Employment Training Agency. Among the
newcomers is Exquisite Form, a brassiere maker that plans to
offer 100 jobs. However, he concedes that machinists used to
making missiles for $20 an hour aren't likely to become bra
makers for $5 an hour.
   Just how bad the area downturn looks depends on one's
perspective. Ralph Menga, deputy director of Riverside's
Development Department, left a Little Rock, Ark., development
firm to move here last year. Compared with Little Rock, where
"six of the seven lending institutions in the city were
either bankrupt or in the hands of the federal regulators,"
the Inland Empire seems to be upholding the California myth
of a recession-proof economy, Mr. Menga says. "Things are
certainly slowing here, but it's nowhere near as bad as
around the rest of the country," he adds.

As a group, senior creditors currently hold nearly 60% of
common equity, and the recapitalization would boost that to

   The company said that all but one of its senior creditors
involved in an earlier restructuring have signed commitment
letters relating to the latest recapitalization. It said the
remaining senior creditor has agreed to defer until Jan. 31
an interest payment due next Monday.

   By 2001, Women to Earn
   More Ph.D.s Than Men

   WASHINGTON -- Women will be earning more doctorate degrees
than men by the year 2001, according to an Education
Department study.
   The study, which projects several educational trends into
the 21st century, says that the number of men who receive
Ph.D.s is declining, while the number of women who receive
them is increasing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The number of male Ph.D. recipients dwindled to 22,627 in
1989, from 26,267 in 1976, while the ranks of their female
counterparts grew to 12,752, from 7,797 during that period.
   The trend suggests that women, who currently earn roughly
65% of what men do, will soon have tools to close the income
gap. But it may also reflect the fact that more men are
passing up academic degrees in humanities or the sciences to
opt for more financially lucrative degrees in business,
medicine or law, according to Christopher Cross, assistant
secretary for education research and improvement. The number
of men receiving professional degrees today is nearly double
that of women, although the gap has narrowed considerably in
recent years.
   Women already receive more master's degrees than men, a
trend that began in 1986 and is attributable partly to the
growing number of women attending graduate school part-time
while raising a family, Mr. Cross said. Women also outnumber
men in overall higher-education enrollment by about one
million, another disparity that the Education Department
projects will grow.

   Futures Become Hot as Economy Slumps,
   Sparing Chicago the Fate of Wall Street

   CHICAGO -- The hard-knocks recession that has been
squeezing New York's securities industry all year is
producing much less pain in Chicago's financial district.
   The Windy City's financial fortunes are based on futures
and options trading, rather than on stocks and bonds,
investment banking and corporate takeovers. And these days,
with the U.S. economy sinking and war clouds building, that
is a crucial difference. Indeed, the bad economic news is
attracting some investors to the futures markets. The two
biggest futures exchanges are in Chicago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As Wall Street brokerage houses limp along on low profits,
laying off brokers and slashing year-end executive bonuses,
some Chicago futures firms are expanding. "The health of the
Chicago futures industry at the moment is considerably better
than the health of Wall Street," declares Perrin Long, an
analyst for Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. who watches
the securities industry.
   Unlike many on Wall Street, futures traders haven't curbed
their spending habits. Traders still flock to Chicago's East
Bank Club when the futures markets close, and new club
memberships are selling briskly at about $2,000 a year. At
Carlos, a French restaurant on Chicago's posh North Shore,
more traders, not fewer, are ordering $100 dinners. "When we
call to confirm reservations, we can hear the roar of the
trading pits in the background," a manager there says.
   Futures trading volume has surged this year --
particularly in contracts based on long-term interest rates,
foreign currencies, the stock market and oil. At the Chicago
Board of Trade, more than 150 million contracts have changed
hands this year, an unprecedented total at this or any other
futures exchange. Last year's volume was 138 million
contracts. At the New York Mercantile Exchange -- the third
largest futures market, where petroleum futures are traded --
volume is up 9% to nearly 42 million contracts this year from
38.5 million in 1989.
   Futures contracts are designed for use in risk-management
strategies known as hedging, and the need to ward off
financial risk tends to increase when the economy goes south.
This demand for futures benefits both the companies that help
investors manage risk and speculators, who try to make money
by guessing which way futures prices are headed and then
riding the wave. For these gunslingers, volatility created by
an uncertain economy can provide opportunity for big scores.
   Consider, for example, a Friday afternoon shortly after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Surging oil prices were unnerving
traders already wary of recession. At the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, prices of futures contracts based on the stock
market were plummeting. Then, a news service reported that
Iraq had pledged to withdraw within days, and suddenly stock
prices bottomed out. While most traders were still
frantically selling stock-index futures, traders for Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co. started buying. Ten minutes later, everyone was
buying: Stock-index futures prices jumped by about $5,000 a
contract, and Bear Stearns made a killing.
   Of course, the futures industry isn't escaping recession
entirely. The Chicago Merc's trading volume actually is down
about 2% from 1989's record, and the Merc has announced it
will eliminate 52 staff jobs through attrition in 1991. One
likely explanation: The Merc's biggest contract -- the
Eurodollar future -- is designed to hedge against risk of
unfavorable swings in short-term interest rates. Short-term
rates, economists note, haven't been as volatile this year as
long-term rates. As a result, some of last year's Eurodollar
business has moved down the street to the Board of Trade,
where contracts based on long-term interest rates are traded.
   In addition, despite increased demand for futures
contracts from big investors, profits have been shaved
somewhat by commission competition among the companies that
help investors manage risk. "You've got very bright money
managers and institutional managers out there looking for the
best deal," says John Danguard, president of the Futures
Industry Association.
   Nevertheless, for most futures firms based in Chicago,
business is good. This fall, while New York brokerages were
handing out pink slips, the managing partner of Chicago-based
Rosenthal Collins Group decided the time was right to expand.
In October, with his request for $50 million in loans from a
Dutch bank granted despite the slowing economy, Leslie
Rosenthal opened a new futures company called Quantum
Financial Services Inc.
   "We obviously would have some trouble if this becomes a
deep, lasting recession and (investors) pull in their horns,"
Mr. Rosenthal says. "But if it's relatively short, it will
help us a lot."
   Robust futures operations also are helping some Wall
Street firms offset weakness in other areas. Among these
firms, analysts say, are Merrill Lynch, with a large
institutional hedging business; Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., with
big profits in both hedging and arbitrage; Salomon Inc., with
its Phibro Energy unit, which helps clients hedge against
oil-price swings; and, to a lesser degree, Bear Stearns.
   Richard L. Sandor, a key figure in developing the first
financial futures contract, says recession hurts futures
markets less than other segments of the financial industry
because futures contracts themselves cover a broad range of
financial activity.
   "An industry with 50 to 100 different products is less
vulnerable to the general level of economic activity than a
specialized market," says Mr. Sandor, president of Indosuez
International Capital Markets. "If equities are weak, you may
have strength in energy. If bonds are weak, there may be
demand for currency contracts."
   Even so, demand for memberships on futures exchanges --
which entitle their owners to do their own trades, and which
are bought and sold at fluctuating pricesis somewhat
sluggish. Of the three biggest futures exchanges, only the
New York Merc's membership prices are higher than they were
six months ago, rising to about $310,000 this month from
about $200,000 in June.
   At the Chicago Merc, seats that sold for about $490,000 in
June are now selling for about $375,000. At the Board of
Trade, seat prices have declined less sharply, from about
$325,000 in June to about $315,000 this month.
   One reason for the sluggish demand for exchange
memberships is that institutional investors who use futures
to hedge don't necessarily need to do their own trading. "The
institutions already know how to use the markets," says the
Futures Industry Association's Mr. Danguard. "They clear
their trades through someone else."

   Windmill Corp. said the Federal Trade Commission approved
its pending acquisition of White Lily Foods Co., a unit of
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.
   Based in San Francisco, Windmill, a privately held
specialty miller of consumer baking products sold under a
variety of labels, said the acquisition of White Lily will
"fit well" with the company's current product line. And the
purchase fits into the company's strategy to broaden its
reach as a national supplier of consumer baking products.
Windmill reported annual sales of $300 million a year ago.
Terms weren't disclosed.

   Spending on research and development is beginning to slow
after more than doubling in the past decade.
   U.S. industry will spend $75.9 billion for research and
product development next year, only 2.2% more than during
1990, according to the annual forecast by Battelle Memorial
Institute, a Columbus, Ohio, research organization.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In real, inflation-adjusted terms, corporate R&amp;D
expenditures will decline slightly, Battelle said, because
the cost of performing research will rise about 2.4% next
year.
   Corporate R&amp;D spending climbed 5.5% in 1990, and is up a
striking 140% from a decade ago, according to National
Science Foundation figures.
   Total research-and-development spending, including
government and institutional funding, will rise 3.5% next
year to $155.2 billion, Battelle forecasts. That's about a 1%
rise in real spending, one quarter of the 4% average rate of
increase during the previous decade.
   "The slowdown in the rate of growth in R&amp;D expenditures
isn't surprising, given the situation with the federal budget
and the general slowdown in business activity," said Douglas
E. Olesen, president and chief executive officer of Battelle,
which performs research for governments and businesses in
more than 30 countries.
   "It wouldn't surprise me if inflation-adjusted spending
declined for a few years after 1991," says Jules J. Duga, the
Battelle researcher who does the annual study. "Spending
won't take off again until 1995 or 1996."
   Even big spenders such as Dow Chemical Co., Midland,
Mich., are rationing 1991 R&amp;D dollars. Dow's U.S. research
spending will creep up less than 1% next year to $650
million, after a spectacular 25% jump in 1990. World-wide,
Dow will spend $1.18 billion, up 2.2%. Profits soared in 1988
and 1989, Dow says, fueling the big 1990 research outlays.
However, skimpier earnings in 1990 and the cloudy outlook for
next year lead the company to be more cautious about 1991 R&amp;D
spending.
   "It's a grim picture," says Delos Smith, senior business
analyst with the Conference Board, a New York-based economics
research organization. "Companies face an incredible profits
squeeze," he says. "One thing that goes is basic science
research. And that's something they need to do for the longer
term."
   Furthermore, says Mr. Smith, government-sponsored research
is "heavily defense-oriented." As federal budget problems and
the end of the Cold War cause a cutback in defense spending,
research spending becomes a target by default. Defense
strategists must continue to spend on operations and
maintenance, and they want to keep buying new weapons, he
says. That will leave less money for research.
   As for the threat of war in the Mideast, it's too early to
predict the effect on defense research spending.
   Battelle's Mr. Duga doesn't expect the current slump in
real R&amp;D outlays to be as long or as deep as the cutback that
occurred between 1970 and 1977. That cut followed completion
of the massive effort to put a man on the moon, and it also
reflected the serious 1974-75 recession.
   Most companies say they're increasing spending on product
development despite the economic slowdown, because continuing
to improve products is essential to growing more competitive
in world markets. For the same reason, most concerns are
continuing to explore new production processes. Electronics,
communications, sensors, and advanced machinery all will
receive more funding next year, Battelle says.
   However, some companies concede that they have cut back on
research work that's interesting but not essential to
immediate product improvement. Basic work on the properties
of materials, entirely new families of chemicals and other
research that may pay off sometime -- but not in the next
year or two -- gets less funding.
   Cincinnati Milacron Inc., for instance, is focusing its
R&amp;D spending on projects directly related to improving its
machine tools, plastics machinery and other products,
officials say. Milacron has curtailed more basic research
that it pursued in the past, as the company fights to regain
market share in an intensely competitive world-wide
capital-goods market.
   Dow Chemical, however, believes companies that maintain
their long-range research programs through the next few years
will have a real leg-up later in the decade, says Robert
Nowak, chief scientist. He says Dow is trimming "a little bit
here and a little bit there," to avoid cutting basic
research.
   New materials represent an especially exciting area, Mr.
Nowak says, including advanced ceramics -- plastics that can
be applied in exceedingly thin films to help create more
powerful electronic chips and plastics that look like metals,
but never rust.
   The federal government, which is expected to account for
46.5% of total R&amp;D outlays, will increase its support by
4.3%, to $72.2 billion, Battelle estimates. Defense projects
will consume 56.8% of federal R&amp;D funds next year, down from
58.4% in 1990. Some of the defense spending, however, goes to
develop new manufacturing technologies, such as
computer-directed factories, and for basic research in
physics, chemistry and biology.
   Space-related research is the most rapidly growing sector,
claiming 12.1% of federal research expenditures next year, up
from 10% last year. Health and Human Services will get 13.1%
of the government funding, a slight decline despite increases
for programs related to AIDS, Battelle said. The Department
of Energy will get 8.8%, a drop from 9.4% in 1990 because of
lower spending for basic energy supply and conservation
studies.
   While industry will provide slightly less than half the
R&amp;D funding, businesses will perform 71.5% of all
research-and-development work, Battelle said, including a
majority of the federally funded programs. The government
will perform 11.3% of the work, colleges and universities
14.4% and other nonprofit organizations 2.8%.

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Investor Leonard M. Ross said he
has proposed to buy all the shares of Hotel Investors Trust
and Hotel Investors Corp. for $13.7 million.
   Mr. Ross currently owns 9.8%, or a 1,190,400 share stake
in the companies, which are paired and trade together on the
New York Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Hotel Investors Trust and Hotel Investors Corp.
shares closed at $1.625, up 50 cents.
   In a Dec. 21 letter attached to a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing, Mr. Ross said that the proposal would
consist of a merger between Rossco Holdings Inc. or a newly
organized corporation to be formed by him, called Newco, and
Hotel Investors.
   Under the merger proposal, holders of the paired shares
would receive $1.25 a share in cash and the stock of a newly
formed subsidiary, the Nevada Corp., into which all of the
assets associated with hotel and gambling properties would be
placed free and clear of mortgage debt. According to the
filing, the stock to be received would be registered.
   Earlier this month, Hotel Investors Trust, a real estate
investment trust based in Los Angeles, suffered a series of
setbacks in its long effort to sell most of its hotels to
Park Plaza Inc., a unit of EIE International Corp. of Japan.
Park Plaza told Hotel Investors that it was unlikely to
complete the sale because of financing problems.

   Yugoslav `Tourists' Flood Into China,
   Pack Their Bags After They Get There

   BEIJING -- As the centerpiece of the new $450 million
World Trade Center, the China World Hotel was envisioned as
an elegant refuge for refined tourists, wealthy traders and
globe-trotting tycoons.
   Today, its marble lobby resembles a luxurious loading
dock. While the hotel orchestra performs Mozart, overweight
couples in overshoes tramp in, dragging huge nylon bags of
clothing behind them. Gumsnapping students and young women
sporting tight jeans, spiked hair and a jangle of bloated gym
bags shuffle through in noisy groups.

<TEXT>
   The desired clientele of genteel capitalists disappeared
from Beijing after troops opened fire on demonstrators 18
months ago. So this city's top hotels are settling for an
unusual strain of socialist fat cats: Yugoslavian black
marketeers.
   They are vacationers with a purpose and they are flooding
into Beijing at the rate of nearly 1,000 a week. Staying
usually six or seven days, they mine money from the cracks
between their country and China's half-reformed socialist
systems. They buy whatever isn't available in Yugoslavia,
from silk shirts to cigarette lighters to fishing rods, and
resell it for prices five to 10 times higher on the black
market back home. A typical profit from such a trip is
$3,000.
   Guest-starved quality hotels here will rent rooms for
about $50 a night. So the visiting Yugoslav proletarians live
like plutocrats in Beijing. They savage breakfast buffets,
stuffing purses and pockets with enough for lunch and dinner.
Room service gets requests for a dozen free toothbrushes at a
time. Blankets and silverware disappear. A hotel that gave
money to a woman claiming cash was stolen from her room found
30 Yugoslavs lined up the next day with the same grievance.
   What the Yugoslav visitors lack in refinement, they make
up for in business savvy. Their country's late leader,
Marshal Tito, was a renegade among Communists because he
allowed small private shops. This inspired the Chinese to do
the same 12 years ago.
   Yugoslavia is far ahead though, with a $6,500 per-capita
income compared with China's $340. China has the edge in
manufacturing clothing and consumer goods. But official
trading channels and socialist bureaucracies of both
countries are too balled up in red tape to respond. Private
Yugoslavs can't get licenses to trade with China. Chinese
can't leave their country to sell in Yugoslavia. So the gap
is filled by any Yugoslav who can arrange a week off and get
enough cash for a plane ticket.
   "If the travel agents could get the planes, this place
would be full of Yugoslavians," says Jasmina Janik, the
Yugoslavian sales manager of Beijing's Jianguo Hotel. "The
good hotels are fighting for these groups because it is the
only market existing now."
   Alex is a 29-year-old chemist at a state factory. Dressed
in a black silk coat and green silk shirt and slacks, he sits
in a hotel bar reminiscing about the good old days of last
January. At that time, Alex could spend $3,000 on silk shirts
and ties in Beijing and turn it into $10,000 in Belgrade.
Then word spread about this money-making vacation of a
lifetime in China. With the coming of the hordes, Alex now
spends $4,000 to earn $7,000 because prices are up here and
down in Yugoslavia. He'll keep coming anyhow. His state
factory is going under. "There's much more money in coming
here," says Alex, who like others requests only his first
name be used because selling imported goods without a license
in Yugoslavia is illegal.
   The top attraction for most foreign visitors to Beijing is
the Forbidden City, a magnificent 9,000-room palace where
China's emperors lived for 600 years. Yugoslavs find it
boring. There's nothing to buy. Few visit the ornate,
6,670-acre Temple of Heaven. But many stop at the market
outside its front gate to buy cigarette lighters, calculators
and pearls. The Great Wall? They can't resist. A vendor there
has Beijing's cheapest silk tablecloths.
   Yugoslav tourists flock to Elegant Water Street, a narrow
alley where about 100 private vendors in cramped metal stalls
hawk clothing. Yugoslav buyers and Chinese vendors, who share
no common language, huddle over calculators, haggling with
hand signals and the only phrase they seem to need is "Show
your last price."
   An $18 silk blouse fetches $100 in Belgrade. A $40 down
jacket sells there for $200 or more. Leather coats bought for
$200 can bring $1,000.
   "I love Yugoslavs," says Xiao Guo, a sweater vendor posing
for pictures with Yugoslav secretaries who just spent a
bundle at his stall. "Our business was dead until they
started coming."
   After a hard day of shopping, soaking in the China World
hotel's black marble whirlpool bath is a welcome respite. A
corpulent Yugoslav bank clerk flails about, using his first
whirlpool experience to see how many water jets can tickle
his body at the same time. Perica, a 27-year-old engineering
student wearing a thick gold necklace, is more sedate. He
made $4,000 on last month's trip. He plans to come back for a
third visit in January. As a student, he says he can live
well on $5,000 a year. Leaning back gazing at the ceiling,
Perica sums up his Christmas vacation:
   "I don't like communists. I don't like China. But this
isn't a bad place to do business."

   French tourism group Club Mediterranee S.A. announced a

   The company's revenue rose to 8.15 billion francs ($1.55
billion) from 7.61 billion francs a year earlier.

   The company didn't release profit figures, but earlier
this month, it estimated earnings after payments to minority
interests would be up about 8% in the year ended Oct. 31 from
the 365 million francs posted in the year-earlier period.
   The company noted, however, that it hasn't yet taken
account of capital gains recorded in the latest period.
   If the 1989-90 figures come in as expected, they would
represent an improvement from the 3% profit decline in the
first half, although they pale in comparison to a 21% advance
the year before.
   Several negative trends affect the company, however. Club
Med is experiencing weak sales in the Mediterranean region as
a result of the Persian Gulf crisis, and the economic
slowdown in the U.S. has cut into North American sales for
its Club Med Inc. unit.

   Giving a Hand:
   Shell Oil Volunteer Program Serves
   Needs of Community and Employees
   ---
   By John A. Conway
</HL>

</DATE>
<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B2
</SO>
<LP>
   WHAT STARTED AS A WAY to make a corporate move to a new
culture palatable has become a long-running testimony to the
fact that while corporations aren't real people, their
employees are.
   The people at Shell Oil Co. demonstrate this with an
all-volunteer good-works program called SERVE (Shell
Employees and Retirees Volunteerism Effort). Since the
company moved its corporate headquarters to Houston over 15
years ago, Shell employees -- managers, secretaries,
geophysicists, technicians -- have contributed one million
hours, most of it their own time, to helping the Texas city
and its people.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Shell's move from New York in the early 1970s sparked the
SERVE idea, according to Robert Dunphy, who was the company's
community affairs director then. Unlike New York City, where
employees trekked several hours from distant communities,
Houston would be considered home for Shell workers living
only 20 or 30 minutes from their jobs. Community involvement
would help the newcomers get oriented, the company reasoned.
When a survey showed that Shell's people were eager to
volunteer, SERVE was born.
   Statistics prove the program's success. In its first full
year, 1976, SERVE drew 107 volunteers. Last year, the number
topped 1,560. The first "recognition luncheon," a stunt to
let volunteers take a bow, drew 153; this year, Houston's
convention center was packed by a crowd of almost 1,400.
   Shell's experience emphasizes a truism of philanthropy.
Volunteers for good works are out there waiting; what's
needed is a way to let them know what they can contribute and
how. "What we do," says Jane Brophy, who now runs the
program, "is to match individual volunteers with the
community's needs." To make these matches, she can tap into a
data bank maintained by Houston's Volunteer Center (supported
by Shell and other companies), which connects her to almost
300 local organizations. Getting the word to employees is
equally important and speed is the watchword because the urge
to volunteer can be fleeting. Shell began with a newsletter
but soon found that it got better and quicker results with a
new format, "SERVE Classified," a monthly list of good-deed
opportunities in want-ad style delivered throughout the
company's eight Houston locations.
   Ms. Brophy, who has been with SERVE for 11 years, says
that offering these lists lets the employees judge whether
they think they can be of help and can spare the time needed.
Shell also supplies on-the-job training for such things as
telephone "reassurance programs" where volunteers make daily
telephone calls to an elderly or handicapped shut-in.
Training in the office  makes it much easier for the
volunteer to get into the act.
   The jobs are as varied as the needs. A company litigator
who once worked for a New Orleans TV station tapes broadcast
readings for the blind. A safety techologist serves as a
mediator in person-to-person conflicts such as landlord and
tenant disputes. A husband and wife team conducts guided
tours at Houston's Woman's Hospital for expectant
grandparents.
   Jane Brophy's one-woman department adds to the mix with
special Shell projects, including a program to fix up homes
for the elderly and poor. More ambitious was the building of
a new park, complete with watering system, for Houston City
Hall; that employed 364 Shell volunteers. Retired company
workers also stay active in SERVE.
   Shell tries to make sure volunteering and company rewards
don't mix, keeping volunteer data out of personnel records.
Ann Porawski, an accounting and administrative manager who
has been in SERVE almost from the beginning, sums it up:
"When you make a difference, it's no sacrifice."

   Nacco Industries Inc. said it expects to take a one-time
charge of $10.3 million, or $1.16 a share, in the fourth
quarter, due primarily to restructuring and plant closings
involving recently acquired businesses.
   Nacco, a fork-lift producer and consumer products and
mining concern, said in Cleveland that it expects to report a
modest profit for the quarter. In the year-ago fourth
quarter, net was $18.9 million, or $2.13 a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nacco said about $7.6 million of the charges reflect
restructuring at the company's 97%-owned Hyster-Yale
Materials Handling unit. The subsidiary is shutting a plant
in Brunswick, Ga., and relocating certain operations to a
North Carolina facility.
   The remaining charges stem from Nacco's 80%-owned Hamilton
Beach/Proctor-Silex unit, including charges for restructuring
operations.

   PARIS -- The French unemployment rate rose to 9.0% of the
work force in November from 8.9% in October, according to
seasonally adjusted data from the Labor Ministry.
   The number of French job-seekers grew 0.5% to 2,535,500 in
November from 2,522,400 in October, the Ministry said. The
figure was also up 0.5% from November 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On an unadjusted basis, the number of job-seekers fell
0.2% to 2,582,500 in November from October, while the
unadjusted figure was up 0.2% from a year ago.
   The Ministry said the rise in job-seekers reflected
reduced hirings as economic growth slowed. The increase in
job-seekers also comes despite a 0.4% decline in the rate of
new entries in the job market and a 7.2% drop in the pace of
individuals returning to the work force after a prolonged
absence.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating
whether McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp.
have made proper financial disclosures regarding the troubled
A-12 aircraft program, both companies confirmed.
   Word of the SEC inquiry, which was first reported by
Defense Week, a trade publication, comes on the heels of a
separate criminal investigation into the A-12 project. That
probe is being led by the U.S. attorney in St. Louis, where
both companies are based.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has given the contractors
until Wednesday to devise a plan to save the A-12, which
although designed to replace the Navy's aging fleet of A-6
attack planes, has been plagued by cost overruns, technical
snags and schedule slips.
   "The SEC has informed us that they are conducting an
informal inquiry related to our disclosures about and
accounting for the A-12 program," a McDonnell Douglas
spokesman said.
   A General Dynamics spokesman said the company is "aware
there's an investigation going on," but wouldn't comment
further. In Washington, an SEC spokesman declined comment.
   In the second quarter, General Dynamics registered a $450
million charge against earnings on the A-12, while McDonnell
Douglas used a different accounting method and didn't take a
writeoff. "We believe it's the difference in reporting that
led to the inquiry," the McDonnell Douglas spokesman said.

   Federal regulators cleared CenTra Inc., a closely held

acquire as much as 24.9% of Citizens Banking Corp.
   Citizens said the ruling allows CenTra to be a passive
investor in the bank holding company but restricts the amount
of influence the trucking company can wield.

   CenTra agreed, among other things, "not to exercise, or
attempt to exercise, a controlling influence over the

the Flint, Mich., company said.
   CenTra, a longtime investor in Citizens, said it is
interested in the bank strictly as an investment. CenTra owns

outstanding. Citizens shares closed unchanged at $18.625 in

   PATEEKA, Pakistan -- The battalion minivan skids to a stop
on the edge of a roadside cliff above the Neelum River,
surging with white water hundreds of feet below. Four
Pakistani soldiers bound out of the van with folding chairs,
binoculars, maps and soft drinks.
   It's time for the "Indian aggression" briefing. Capt.
Shahid Ahmed, company commander in Pakistan's 7th Northern
Light Infantry, points across the river and says, "Their
chaps opened fire from those bunkers, hitting five of our
chaps."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Capt. S. Qasim Shah, an army public relations officer,
doesn't like what he hears. He didn't bounce for three hours
over a mountain road from Muzaffarabad to hear the enemy
referred to as "their chaps." He interrupts: "The enemy shot
and badly wounded five innocent Pakistani civilians. It was a
bloody act of totally unprovoked Indian aggression."
   Indian aggression, be it theoretical or actual, is
important to Pakistan. It is pivotal to Pakistan's sense of
self-importance and relevance in the region, a sense that has
been shaken in recent months by the suspension of U.S. aid
and the Soviet-U.S. agreement to cut off arms and money to
neighboring Afghanistan's warring factions. For more than a
decade, Pakistan served as a funnel through which the U.S.
poured $300 million annually in arms and aid to Moslem
guerrillas fighting the Soviet-supported Afghan government.
   Without the Afghan war, Pakistan needs another role.
Leaders in Islamabad see their nation as a key player in any
Persian Gulf post-crisis peacekeeping. In the meantime,
Pakistan does its best to focus attention on its 43-year-old
conflict with India.
   That has never been easy. Over three wars, in 1947, 1965
and 1971, India and Pakistan have reminded the world that
their mutual 1,200-mile-long border is a cut that won't heal.
They were on the verge of war again last spring, this time
with each country, as local journalists like to put it,
within "a screwdriver turn" of having nuclear weapons. That
got everybody's attention, but Saddam Hussein snatched it
away on Aug. 2 by invading Iraq.
   Mammoth India never fades long from consciousness. But
Pakistan is another story. It has a new prime minister, Nawaz
Sharif, who defeated Benazir Bhutto in an election this fall,
and he has his hands full trying to govern 110 million
people, three out of four of whom can't read or write and
most of whom are landless laborers earning less than $400 a
year.
   But these days men like Capt. Qasim have the toughest jobs
in Pakistan: He and men like him have the increasingly
quixotic task of garnering the world's attention, sympathy
and support for a nation that spends 52% of its national
budget on defense, fuels violence in adjacent India and works
tirelessly to develop nuclear weapons. The U.S. Congress
recently froze $573 million in military and economic aid over
reports of Pakistan's continued persuit of the atomic bomb.
   Capt. Qasim escorts visiting journalists to one of the
world's great flashpoints: the cease-fire line between India
and Pakistan in Kashmir. It is known officially as the Line
of Control. It divides Azad Kashmir, a semiautonomous
Pakistani state, and Jammu and Kashmir, an Indian state. The
Iron Curtain has melted away with the Cold War. But this
line, older and longer than the demilitarized zone that
divides Korea, remains, a symbol of hate and intransigence.
   The message here is simple: Pakistan is still important in
a world that doesn't seem to be paying attention; Pakistani
jawans, enduring hardships, fend off Indian army hordes.
After high-altitude artillery duels in September, the
Pakistan army announced success in "shattering Indian
arrogance."
   Before 1971, Pakistan was considered important on grounds
of size alone. It was the world's fifth most-populous nation.
But in a war with India that year, it lost East Pakistan and
dropped to ninth in the population standings, right behind
Bangladesh, the nation created out of territory it lost.
   During the Cold War, Pakistan positioned itself as a
pro-Western bulwark "squeezed between two militant neighbors,
superpower Russia to the north and India, an aspirant to that
status, in the east," in the words of one writer. Today both
India and the Soviet Union are preoccupied with internal
disintegration.
   The Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 put
Pakistan on the map again. With U.S. and Saudi Arabian
billions, it funneled military hardware to Afghan mujahideen
insurgents. But the Soviets left almost two years ago,
Afghanistan is being called the forgotten war, and the
Pakistan funnel is drying up.
   From November 1988 to last August, Pakistan was notable
for being the first Islamic state to have a female prime
minister. Benazir Bhutto was popular in the West, too --
being young, female and educated at Harvard and Oxford. She
also was unusual for heading one of only four elected
governments in Pakistan's history-military dictators have
ruled Pakistan for more than 25 of its 43 years.
   Capt. Qasim has the task of telling visiting journalists
what Pakistan isn't doing. The Pakistani military isn't
fueling the uprisings in the Indian side of Kashmir and the
Punjab, he says. And it has no connection, he says, to the
two main Kashmir liberation groups with headquarters in
Muzaffarabad, where he also lives. Diplomatic sources say
Pakistan has withheld support to the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation
Front, which seeks independence, and supports the Hezbul
Mujahideen, which wants all of Kashmir to be part of
Pakistan.
   "Hezbul is our fighting force," says Sheikh
Aqeel-ur-Rehman, a 34-year-old lawyer and president of
Jamati-e-Islami in Muzaffarabad. Not only doesn't it get help
from the Pakistan military, it has had big trouble getting
ammunition for its fighters, he says, adding: "We appeal to
all freedom-loving peoples and peace-loving countries in
helping us with ammunition."
   Sheikh Aqeel says Hezbul's goal is to turn Kashmir into
the next Afghanistan and he says his group looks forward to
welcoming the Afghan mujahideen to fight alongside them. "It
is possible we may capture some parts of Kashmir by force,"
he says. The Afghan mujahideen want to send guns, ammo and
fighters "but the Pakistan government doesn't allow."
   Also in Muzaffarabad is Amanullah Khan, 57-year-old
chairman of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front. His house is
guarded by young men with machine guns and full of young
Kashmiris and their sleeping bags. "Refugees," he says with a
wink. "All right, we do it," he says when asked about border
crossings. Weapons smuggling? "We do it."
   Sometimes, even Pakistan's friends are bad for its image.
The secretary-general of the India-Pakistan Friendship
Society is Satish Kumar, a college professor in New Delhi,
India's capital. The organization promotes friendship between
the two countries, but that doesn't mean it has to play down
Pakistan's faults.
   "Over the years of prolonged military rule, an entrenched
group of officers has developed deep interests in the
economy," says Prof. Kumar. "Granting licenses for drug
trafficking is most lucrative for them. This business is very
directly protected by the military establishment."
   Pakistan aid for Kashmir is "low-cost troublemaking," he
says. "They don't want to end it. It doesn't cost much."

   Southeast Banking Corp., Miami, said its primary banking
subsidiary is negotiating a 10-year agreement with
International Business Machines Corp. under which IBM will
manage the bank's data processing operations.
   The pact, part of a banking trend of handing over
computing tasks to computer companies, will save the
subsidiary, Southeast Bank, $6 million in the first year,
bank officials said. The agreement will also give, within one
year, the bank's 230 branches a sophisticated new system for
completing transactions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kenneth T. Sheridan, executive vice president for systems
and operations, said it would have taken Southeast three
years to assemble the system on its own, and would have cost
the bank more to operate it. He declined to put a value on
the transaction, which Southeast Bank and IBM expect to
complete next month.
   Southeast Bank is attempting to cut costs as it struggles
with losses from commercial real estate loans. Southeast
Banking Corp. recorded a net loss of $164.4 million for the
first nine months of 1990.

   Itoman &amp; Co., a Japanese trading company troubled with
huge investments in real estate, said it agreed to sell its
88.22% stake in Itoman Total Housing Corp. to two real estate
companies affiliated with Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
   A spokesman for Itoman said Sogo Real Estate Co. and
Ohtemachi Tatemono K.K. will pay a total of nine billion yen
($66 million) for the stake.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move is part of Itoman's previously announced program
to cut its property-investment debts, estimated in the fall
at 876 billion yen.
   In 1988, Itoman bought the stake in Itoman Total Housing,
then called Sugiyama &amp; Co., at the request of Sumitomo Bank.
Sumitomo and Itoman have had close ties since 1975 when
Sumitomo sent its former managing director to run the
troubled trading company.
   The latest agreement also calls for Itoman and seven other
affiliated firms to sell some of their properties to Itoman
Total Housing. The accord will help Itoman reduce its debts
on a consolidated basis by 192.2 billion yen, according to
the Itoman spokesman.
   But the prospects for Itoman's turnaround are believed to
be clouded, due to the deteriorating Japanese real estate
market. In November, Sumitomo Bank said it was sending a
rescue team to try to help Itoman through its problems.

   ITOMAN &amp; Co.'s agreement to sell its 88.22% stake in

   NEW YORK -- Memberships of four major New York commodities
exchanges approved, as expected, a relocation of their
trading floors to a new site just north of the World Trade
Center in lower Manhattan.
   Voting by the members -- which followed approval by the
four exchanges' boards on Nov. 29 -- was completed late last
week. Final tallies were made yesterday, a spokeswoman for
the exchanges said.
</LP>

   The four exchanges are the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the Commodity Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange
and the New York Cotton Exchange. The New York Futures
Exchange, a unit of the New York Stock Exchange, which rents
space from the Cotton Exchange, is also expected to move to
the new location.
   The relocation issue has been closely watched because of a
battle that ensued between New York and New Jersey over which
state would get the exchanges, which currently operate side
by side on one floor of the World Trade Center but need more
space. The new trading facility is scheduled to be available
for occupancy by the exchanges in 1994.

   CHEVY CHASE, Md. -- Citing "fundamental differences"
between the company and shareholders, Greater Washington
Investors Inc. announced the resignation of several top
executives.
   Stephen W. Ritterbush, president and chief executive
officer, and Richard P. Whitney, senior vice president, have
resigned as officers and directors of the company. A group of
directors also resigned, comprising John E. Gray, David T.
Krausman, Hilliard W. Paige, Henry M. Ross, Charles Henry
Smith Jr. and Edmund W.E. Stein.

<TEXT>
   GWI, the nation's second-oldest venture capital firm, said
that David L. Chandler, chairman of the board, will serve as
chief executive officer on an interim basis until a new
president is found. Mr. Chandler said the resignations were
the result of fundamental differences between the resigning
directors and the three remaining directors: himself, Rainer
H. Bosselmann and D. Irving Obrow, all of whom are associated
with Johnston Industries Inc.
   Johnston Industries, an operator of textile mills, is
GWI's largest shareholder; Mr. Chandler also is Johnston's
chairman and chief executive. In a Dec. 5 filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Johnston Industries said
it boosted its stake in GWI to 36.9% of the common shares
outstanding. At the time, Johnston didn't give a reason for
boosting its holdings.
   A spokeswoman for GWI declined to comment further on the
resignations or the differences between the outgoing
management and the shareholders, saying: "We've been

   Continental Insurance Cos. asked a U.S. court to protect
it from having to pay Wickes Cos.' defense costs in
securities-fraud cases involving Michael Milken.
   Continental filed the lawsuit in federal court in
Manhattan asking the court to declare that Wickes's general
liability coverage doesn't apply either to defense costs or
any damages that might be awarded. Wickes is named as a
defendant, along with Mr. Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc.'s brokerage unit, in four civil lawsuits alleging
securities fraud.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Continental argues that the insurance doesn't apply mainly
because the cases allege wrongdoing by Wickes. According to
the lawsuit, the coverage applies only to damages or injuries
caused by an accident. "Stock manipulation is the antithesis
of an accident," said Barry Ostrager, an attorney
representing Continental. "That's someone willfully
committing something that is wrong."
   The allegations against Wickes stem from stock
transactions in 1986 that allowed the company to convert its
preferred stock into nondividend-paying common shares and to
save about $15 million annually in dividend payments. The
lawsuits against Wickes, Mr. Milken and Drexel allege that
the conversion was the result of an illegal
stock-manipulation scheme. Prosecutors allege that Mr. Milken
directed the manipulation of the Wickes stock with the
assistance of Ivan Boesky; Wickes wasn't charged with any
criminal wrongdoing.
   A spokeswoman for Wickes, a Santa Monica, Calif.,
manufacturer and retailer, declined to comment on the suit by
the Continental Corp. unit.
   Both Mr. Milken and Mr. Boesky pleaded guilty to felonies
related to securities transactions, but the counts they
admitted didn't involve Wickes. Coincidentally, Continental's
lawsuit was assigned at random to Judge Kimba Wood, the same
judge who last month sentenced Mr. Milken to 10 years in
prison.

   PFIZER LOSES bid to throw out investors' suits over heart
valve.
   In federal court in Manhattan, Judge John Keenan rejected
a motion by Pfizer Inc. to dismiss the class-action lawsuits,
which seek unspecified damages. The lawsuits, which have been
consolidated, claim that investors from March 27, 1987, to
Feb. 26, 1990, were defrauded because Pfizer failed to
disclose problems with the artificial heart valve. On Feb.
26, a House subcommittee staff report criticized the New York
pharmaceutical company for its level of disclosure. The
heart-valve was removed from the market in 1986.
   Pfizer argued that the suits should be dismissed for not
making adequate claims of fraud. But Judge Keenan, in
allowing the suits to go forward, said: "The sources of
plaintiffs' allegations, such as the staff report and others,
are highly reputable. The allegations, therefore, are not
unfounded or speculative."
   Judge Keenan also said in his opinion that "Pfizer knew
that there were problems with the heart valves, and it knew
that suits {by heart-valve recipients} were being and
expected to be filed. Whether what was told to investors was
sufficient is an issue for trial."
   Attorneys for Pfizer couldn't be reached for comment.

   PROFESSOR WINS RIGHT to sue over alleged free speech
deprivation.
   A federal judge ruled that the professor, who espouses the
view that blacks are intellectually inferior to whites, can
sue officials of City College of the City University of New
York for allegedly violating his First Amendment right of
free speech.
   The professor, Michael Levin, who is white, teaches
philosophy at the college. His statements and writings about
race have led to protests and demonstrations at the school,
where the student body is 39% black, 28% Hispanic, 17% white
and 16% Asian. Following the campus protests, the college
formed a faculty committee to review the issue of when
academic freedom can be restricted and to examine some of Mr.
Levin's statements.
   Judge Kenneth Conboy ruled that because the committee's
recommendations could lead to the revocation of Mr. Levin's
tenure, the professor's suit can proceed. The judge didn't
rule on whether the college infringed on the professor's
rights. Mr. Levin said he has turned down speaking
engagements and requests for articles because he is worried
about how the faculty committee will react.
   In the suit, he also alleged that college officials were
unwilling to punish student protesters who disrupted his
classes and threatened his safety.

   MOST LIBEL CLAIMS against Glamour are thrown out in
Foretich case.
   A lawsuit by Eric A. Foretich alleged that a Glamour
magazine article left the false impression that he had
sexually abused his daughter, as claimed by his ex-wife,
Elizabeth Morgan.
   In throwing out all but one remaining libel claim, U.S.
District Judge Gerhard Gesell of Washington stated that it
was "crystal clear" that the disputed statements constituted
opinions and thus were constitutionally protected. Conde Nast
Publications Inc. publishes Glamour.
   The judge allowed Mr. Foretich to proceed with one libel
claim stemming from a reader's letter. A lawyer for Mr.
Foretich couldn't be reached for comment.

   Forget about Eastern Europe, "personalized" marketing and
Japan's emergence as an international advertising force.
   Those hot topics on Madison Avenue during 1990 will move
to the back burner as we ring in the new year. The hottest
issue in 1991: surviving the "Big R."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Top ad agency executives, gazing into their crystal balls,
say the recession not only will slash companies' ad
expenditures and agency staff levels. It also will spark an
ad-industry crackdown on slow-paying clients, a rise in
client defections and an expansion of hard-sell marketing
techniques.
   "We're dealing with a very tough marketplace out there,"
says Carl Spielvogel, chairman of Backer Spielvogel Bates
Worldwide, a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi unit. Stanley Katz, chairman
and chief executive officer of Foote Cone &amp; Belding's New
York operation, concurs: "Everything is going to get tougher,
not better. If there's a danger sign ahead in 1991, it's an
overreaction to that" by agencies and clients.
   Here's how ad-industry leaders see the recession fallout
shaping up:
                                                                                                       

   Agencies will get tougher with their clients, curbing
generous credit terms for financially shaky companies and
shunning low-paying new accounts.
   During good times, agencies paid scant attention to how
slowly some clients paid their bills. No longer. With profit
margins squeezed, "agencies will watch their receivables like
they have never watched them before," says William Weithas,
chairman and chief executive of Lintas: Worldwide, an
Interpublic Group unit. "No businessman wants to take the
risk of doing business with either insolvent or low-rated
companies," he explains.
   For example, WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson relinquished
Health &amp; Tennis Corp.'s $50 million media account last month
after the unit of financially troubled Bally Manufacturing
refused to pay cash up front for media buys.
   In another sign of today's glum times, several major
agencies refused to bid for Trans World Airlines' $45 million
ad account this fall because the airline offered unusually
low compensation. Will agencies spurn TWA-type deals again?
"You can bet your life" they will, Mr. Weithas says. Ad
people "aren't going to give (their services) away."
                                                                                                       

   More jittery advertisers will dump their agencies,
snowballing this year's flurry of account switches.
   "Historically, more clients jump ship in bad times because
they get harder-nosed and say, `I want results,'" observes
Foote Cone's Mr. Katz.
   The greatest movement likely will come from industries in
the deepest trouble, such as retailing, financial services
and cars. Earlier this month, Montgomery Ward dropped Saffer
USA in favor of the Chicago office of D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp;
Bowles for its estimated $25 million to $30 million account.
Similarly, Chase Manhattan named Wells, Rich, Greene its lead
agency for more than $35 million in ad billings -- largely
forsaking Scali, McCabe, Sloves, the WPP Group unit that had
handled the majority of the account.
   Agency heads say they're hustling more aggressively for
new business because of the threat of defections and because
so many existing clients have trimmed their agency fees or ad
budgets.
                                                                                                       

   A stronger push for results will tilt the ad-spending
pendulum more toward promotions and spur advertisers to be
less daring in their campaigns.
   An expected slowdown in spending on coupons, contests,
sweepstakes and other short-term promotions never
materialized this year. Instead, companies worried about the
sour economy will keep shifting bucks away from traditional
media advertising because they can measure results faster
with promotions. Clients "feel they can't take any chances.
They need to get sales now," says Burton Manning, chairman of
J. Walter Thompson.
   Direct-mail expenditures, for example, should climb 6.5%
during 1991, a faster clip than any other ad category and
less than the scant 4.6% for all U.S. ad spending, predicts
Robert J. Coen, a McCann-Erickson senior vice president and
the ad industry's leading agency forecaster.
   The recession also will breed caution. Clients are
abandoning wildly creative ads and flighty corporate-image
drives in favor of "tried-and-true" techniques such as ads
focused on price cuts. "There will be a temptation to do a
lot more `me-too' advertising," notes JWT's Mr. Manning. He
and other agency chiefs find this strategy flawed. An
unexpected, startling or controversial ad is "the stuff that
sells the merchandise," he insists. But clients' interest in
unconventional approaches, he admits, "goes away in a
recession."

   The Grandest Affirmative Action Failure of All

   KUALA LUMPUR -- In the wake of India's caste riots, Sri
Lanka's civil war and Fiji's political mess, one might expect
Asian policy makers to have wised up to the dangers of racial
number-crunching. That is not the case.
   In Malaysia, in particular, the arithmetic of race is
calculated in education, in business and in every part of the
political system. The country's wide-ranging efforts of
social engineering have only widened ethnic divisions and
damped economic growth. They have also undermined any chance
of creating a national identity to which all Malaysians can
claim a connection. Malaysia is a lesson with implications
for any society tempted to believe that racial formulas can
be allocated with justice and imposed without rancor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The occasion for this review is the completion of the
20-year term of Malaysia's New Economic Policy. Formulated
after 248 people died in race riots in May 1969, the NEP had
two goals for this nation of Malay, Chinese and Indian
ancestry: to eliminate poverty, and "to reduce and eventually
eliminate the identification of race with economic function."
   The NEP's seemingly neutral language was directed at the
Chinese, who constitute 32% of Malaysians, and who did and do
dominate much of the private-sector economy. The government
decided to try to tip the balance by promoting Malay economic
interests through employment and educational quotas, loans,
subsidies, licensing preferences, and the creation of "trust
agencies" -- government-owned enterprises that acquire equity
in the name of the "Bumiputras." "Bumiputras," Malay for
"sons of the soil," are a classification that includes ethnic
Malays and other indigenous groups. Bumiputras constitute 58%
of the population.
   The NEP was a social engineer's dream. Political elites,
by pulling the right policy levers, would generate an
increasingly competitive Bumiputra entrepreneurial and
professional class. And because the economy would be growing
madly all the while, the Chinese wouldn't mind much. (The 10%
Indian minority was left out of all this.) "The NEP is the
economic foundation for Malaysian society," reiterated the
government in 1985 in an official report. "The achievement of
the NEP targets will provide a firm and lasting foundation
for national unity."
   But 20 years on, even the NEP's defenders agree that
national unity is as distant as ever. No race riots have
rocked the country since 1969, but racial tensions are close
to the surface. "The government says it's one Malaysia, we're
all Malaysians, but that's something of a farce," says an
embittered Chinese high-school teacher in Penang. "It's
really Bumi or non-Bumi. Rightly or wrongly, they are called
sons of the soil. But I was born here and so was my father."
   The teacher, whose son is studying at his own expense at
an Australian university, singles out education preferences
for Bumiputras as a particular sore point. The preferences
work in several different ways. First, major institutions
have quotas to maintain a roughly 55%-45%
Bumiputra/non-Bumiputra composition. Second, the MARA
Institute of Technology, which gives out more than 20,000
degrees a year, allots only 5% of its places for
non-Bumiputras. Third, about 80% of all scholarships go to
Malays. And finally, says a professor at a Kuala Lumpur
university, Malays are graded more leniently in the
classroom.
   In Malaysia there are not enough places to go around; the
country sends only about 6% of its students on to local
higher education, compared with 59% for the U.S., 20% for
Thailand and 38% for the Philippines. That explains why
Malaysia's Chinese and Indian students, according to official
figures, are twice as likely to study abroad as Bumiputras.
   The combination of entrance and scholarship preferences
makes a double bind. Admissions quotas shut out some
qualified non-Bumiputras, who therefore must go abroad to
study but can't always afford to because scholarships for
them are limited. It is hard to know how many children of
Indian pedicab drivers and Chinese day laborers get squeezed
by this Catch-22. But it is certain that the effect is a rise
in resentment and a fall in academic standards. "While the
numbers game may have been won" regarding Bumiputra
enrollment, "the institutionalization of mediocrity is a
by-product of the 1970 NEP restructuring targets," concluded
Kamal Salih of the independent Malaysian Institute of
Economic Research in December 1988.
   Higher education quotas and scholarships have not
benefited poor Malays as much as the Bumiputra elite. These,
of course, are the people who run the government and have
decided that the nation can't live without extending the NEP.
   Advocates of the NEP can point to some progress. Malaysia
has averaged about 6.5% growth a year since 1970 and the
poverty rate has dropped. By official reckoning, the
Bumiputra equity share has risen from 1.5% to about 20%;
other estimates put it higher. Malaysians of every race agree
that since 1969 a visible Bumiputra professional class has
emerged.
   The question is how much credit should go to the NEP. When
the economy slipped into recession in the mid-1980s, the
government loosened NEP restrictions; the obvious implication
is that growth would have been higher without them. And in
terms of changing employment patterns, urbanization and a
changing economy were likely greater factors than an
overblown affirmative action plan.
   Considering all this, the Malaysian authorities could well
declare the NEP a success and have done with it. But because
the NEP has been presented to Bumiputras as living proof of a
benevolent and protective government, not extending the NEP
would be interpreted as a rejection. "Letting the NEP die was
never a prospect," says Noordin Sopiee, director of the
Malaysian Institute for Strategic and International Studies.
   Another major reason for keeping the NEP is that the way
it has been put into practice has bolstered the power of the
ruling coalition, the Barisan Nasional, which is dominated by
the United Malays National Organization and its two junior
partners, the Malaysia Chinese Association and the Malaysian
Indian Congress.
   Because Malays are more or less guaranteed political power
through UMNO, which has ruled since independence in 1957, the
temptation has been to use the political system to advance
ethnic goalsand, eventually, personal ones. Many people, said
then-Deputy Prime Minister Musa Hitam in the early 1980s,
"had joined {UMNO} to acquire more wealth." This desire fit
hand-in-glove with the NEP's restructuring goals, which
required massive government intervention in the economy.
   In the name of the Bumiputras, government and party now
control much of the mining, plantation and finance
industries, and are an increasing presence in construction
and the media. "The ruling elites, in assuming the role of
trustees, have emerged as a cartel," writes economist Ozay
Mehmet. "They have effectively cornered economic planning and
decision-making to enrich themselves while paying lip-service
to poverty eradication."
   A classic example of how the government uses the NEP to
justify its self-aggrandizement was the awarding in 1987 of
the country's largest public-works contract. The contract to
build a 550-mile road from Singapore to Thailand -- worth
more than $1.8 billion -- went to United Engineers (Malaysia)
Bhd., a company that "had never built any roads and has a
dismal record in many other respects," as the Gerakan Party,
a member of the ruling coalition, pointed out in a letter to
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed. The company did, however,
have one crucial qualification -- it was controlled by UMNO.
   By awarding the contract to United Engineers (Malaysia),
the government could claim progress on the NEP, because the
company's main shareholder was considered a "Bumiputra"
company. It could also pat itself on the back for
"privatization," since the government per se would not build
the road and collect the tolls.
   How all the finagling that marked this deal helped the
average Bumiputra catch up economically is unclear. More
corporate equity may be in nominally Bumiputra hands, but the
real winners are a few, mostly UMNO-connected businessmen.
How the deal helped UMNO is obvious. One reason the
government gave for granting the project to United Engineers
(Malaysia) is that the profits would help pay for the World
Trade Center, a sleek skyscraper in downtown Kuala Lumpur
that is home to the UMNO party headquarters.
   The fundamental problem with the NEP is that, combined
with the constitutional provisions that make Islam the
official religion and Bahasa Malaysia the official language,
it reinforces the idea that Bumiputras are the only real
Malaysians. Members of the Chinese and Indian minorities, for
example, are commonly referred to as "immigrants," even
though most can trace their Malaysian origins back at least
three generations. Why should there be different degrees of
citizenship just because one's great-great-grandparents were
not born on what is now Malaysian soil?
   There is no sensible answer to this question. But as long
as the powers-that-be swallow most of the NEP's benefits,
they have little incentive to address its abuses. Until that
changes, the NEP subverts its goal of providing "a firm and
lasting foundation for national unity."

   Carnival Cruise Lines Faces Choppy Waters
   In Some Areas, but Its Boosters Stay Confident

   NEW YORK -- If anything in the 1980s caught on faster than
Nintendo, Ninja Turtles or junk bonds, it was the
recreational cruise. In 1981, 41,000 berths were afloat in
North America. The number now is 84,000, with 18,000 more due
in the next two years.
   The chief exponent and beneficiary of this boom has been
Carnival Cruise Lines, the biggest North American operator.
The question now is to what extent Carnival may suffer from
an overhang of berths, which is hitting the market just as
higher air fares are raising the cost of air and sea
packages, the world is awash in rival amusements such as
theme parks and casinos, and the economy seems headed into a
recessionary dive.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Miami-based Carnival is, according to travel agents and
tour operators, the best cruise operator going. And with the
exception of tiny Regency Cruises, Carnival is the only
publicly traded U.S. operator. Short of buying or selling an
ocean liner, Carnival's stock is the only major way for
investors to play the cruise market.
   That market appears soft. Travel agents say bookings are
holding up, but prices are not. "There is an awful lot of
discounting going on," says Jay Lewis, president of Market
Scope, a market research firm. "Everybody is feeling it," a
tour operator adds.
   Howard Frank, Carnival's senior vice president for
finance, says "we really haven't seen any softness. Our
bookings are holding strong." However, Mr. Frank's tone is
that of a man who has, at least, glimpsed the potential for
softness. Carnival's brochure prices for 1991 are being held
flat. Why? "Uncertainty about what this softer economy will
do for us," Mr. Frank says. "If people keep telling you that
things are soft, your thinking becomes colored."
   On its two oldest ships (out of 15 mostly newer ones)
Carnival is already promoting or discounting more heavily
than in past years, Mr. Frank says. And Carnival's Bahamas
hotel and casino, which according to Mr. Frank "seems more
prone to recession," should post losses of $20 million to $22
million for fiscal 1990, ended Nov. 30.
   Air fares paid by Carnival will rise an estimated 10% in
1991. Carnival hedges most, but not all, of its fuel costs.
And its labor costs, in 1991 as in most years, are apt to
rise a bit. The coupling of higher costs with stable prices,
Mr. Frank notes, will depress profit margins on cruises,
perhaps by a couple of percentage points. The engine of
Carnival's growth, in the immediate future, will be more
beds. The 2,044-berth Ecstasy will debut in June; three other
ships are in construction.
   Thus, Carnival will need to continue growing even as the
general economy, and in particular, the market for leisure
dollars, contracts. Mr. Frank says it will do so. The company
has an advantage in name-recognition with travel agents and
tourists. "We have a huge reservations center; we make it
easy for agents to book on Carnival," he says.
   Wall Street agrees. Bear Stearns, Salomon Brothers and
Shearson Lehman are bullish on Carnival shares. At 14 1/2,
they trade at 9 1/2 times earnings based on Carnival's
estimate of $1.50 to $1.55 a share for the recently ended
fiscal year. This, to Shearson's Caroline Levy, signals that
the stock is "more than discounting the negatives of fuel
prices and recession."
   But Wall Street in some respects seems to believe that
Carnival will sail through the recession essentially
unscathed. Steven Eisenberg of Bear Stearns says, "The public
is demanding price and value and Carnival's reputation is
built on that." He envisions net income rising 13% in fiscal
1991. Salomon, despite the soft market, sees Carnival's
cruise revenue growing in 1991 by 15% and profit margins on
cruises dropping by only a half-percentage point.
   At 14 1/2, Carnival is trading at about twice its book
value and it has $1.27 billion in debt, equal to a hefty 57%
of capital. Carnival's strengths are real. It may suffer a
recession after other cruise lines, and to a lesser extent
than others. But given the supply of berths, it seems
unlikely that if discounting becomes fierce Carnival won't be
hurt.
   The secret of its heady growth has been that Ted Arison,
Carnival's founder and controlling stockholder, recognized
that cruises, once the preserve of the idle rich, could be
popularized. Although some of its cruises are pricey,
Carnival's passengers, in the main, are what Bear Stearns'
Mr. Eisenberg refers to as "Mr. and Mrs. Middle America." If
anyone is apt to feel the recession, they will. The most
beguiling of bullish arguments, stated by Salomon, is that
more supply will lead to more demand. As Salomon puts it,
"the fanfare associated with major ship launchings {may} help
inflate demand, and to some extent offset a weak economy."
But after 10 years of new ship launchings, this may be a
slender reed on which to invest.

   Central California's Citrus Growers
   Seek Disaster Relief After Cold Wave

   Citrus growers and county agricultural officials in
central California's tri-county citrus belt urged county
officials to declare the region a disaster area after a week
of record low temperatures ravaged the navel orange crop.
   The declaration of a local disaster is the first step
toward seeking state and federal disaster relief.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Growers also encouraged state agricultural officials to
lobby the state legislature to place a moratorium on the sale
or shipment of all San Joaquin Valley citrus produce this
year, similar to past practices in Texas and Florida, in
order to protect the reputation of citrus fruit produced in
the area.
   More than 65 growers, shippers and county officials
gathered in the County Agricultural Building to share horror
stories about what the coldest week since 1913 had done to
the 125 square miles of prime citrus groves at the base of
the Sierra mountain range.
   Carl A. "Skip" Pescosolido, 54 years old, a co-owner of
Sequoia Orange Co., in Exeter, Calif., which farms 5,000
acres of groves in the region, estimated the loss to the
company at $16 million. By the end of this week about 310, or
60%, of the 520 employees will be given work furloughs, he
said. Next week there will be more layoffs and job
reassignments, he added.
   "Somebody said it must be the greenhouse effect," said Mr.
Pescolido. "If anyone mentions the word greenhouse to me
again they're going to get a crooked nose."
   A spokesman for the California Citrus Mutual Association,
which represents about 800 growers in Fresno, Kern and Tulare
counties, said regional citrus crop damage estimates are
between $300 and $400 million.
   In Tulare County, the largest citrus-growing county in the
region, county agricultural officials said about 75% of the
navel orange crop was left on the trees and preliminary
estimates place losses at between $200 and $250 million.
   At the meeting, county officials and independent and
corporate growers planned to establish guidelines for
inspection of freeze-damaged fruit and to try to assess the
widespread damage to citrus crops.
   Fresno County agricultural officials said that 90% of the
county's annual $70 million citrus crop was still on the
trees when temperatures dipped to the mid-teens last week.
Across the region, growers attempted to flood groves, warm
roots with smudge pots and blow warm air in an attempt to
save crops and young trees, which also have reportedly been
damaged by the sub-freezing temperatures.
   "Old-timers haven't seen temperatures like this since a
similar cold spell in 1937, and baby-boom generation growers
have never experienced it," said Joel Nelson, the president
of the growers association, which is based in Visalia, Calif.
   Across the state, lemon, avocado, and valencia orange
crops have been damaged. Ventura County agricultural
officials place losses from lemon and avocado crops at $100
million, and Los Angeles County, though not as hard hit by
the bruising temperatures, places losses at $3 million.

   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. -- County Bank named Roy G. Green,
its president and chief executive officer, to the additional
post of chairman, as part of a management and financial
reorganization of the savings bank.
   Mr. Green succeeds William J. Levy, the company's largest
shareholder with a more than 25% stake. Mr. Levy along with
business partner Roy Millender, who holds about a 9% stake,
resigned from the board but will retain their ownership
interests in the bank, and intend to buy shares in a coming
preferred stock issue, the company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It has become increasingly clear to me that, in this
demanding environment, it makes sense that County be led by
an experienced banker with Roy Green's background and
skills," Mr. Levy said. Mr. Green joined County Bank in 1987
after serving as president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Dallas.
   County Bank also said it completed the conversion of
$22.15 million in long-term subordinated debt to preferred
stock, "a move which significantly improved the bank's
current core capital position to 2.3%," the company said.
County said it submitted a new capital plan to the Office of
Thrift Supervision last month that includes a "significantly
higher" level of reserves, more conservative real estate
valuations and a higher core capital goal of 5%.

   Bondholders Seek Assurance
   U.S. Won't Seize Bank
   Except if It Is Insolvent

   BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. bondholders are
holding up approval of a debt-for-equity swap, saying they
want assurances from federal regulators that the ailing bank
won't be seized prematurely.
   The assurances are the main condition bondholders are
seeking before approving the proposed swap, which would give
Bank of New England breathing room by raising desperately
needed capital. Many analysts say that the bank won't be able
to survive for long if the swap isn't completed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bondholder representatives, who tentatively agreed last
week to swap $706 million in debentures for 92% ownership of
the bank's common stock, said they are planning to meet with
officials at the office of the comptroller of the currency
early next week. They plan to discuss whether the bank's
preliminary year-end earnings report, which has been given to
regulators but not disclosed publicly, indicates an imminent
seizure. Bondholder wariness was first reported yesterday in
American Banker.
   "No one is going to swap into mostly equity if the
institution is about to be seized," said Gregory Kiernan,
chairman of the subordinated bondholders committee. "We'd
look like fools. It'd be tantamount to bondholder suicide."
While bondholders have some contractual rights to a bank's
assets if it is seized, stockholders get wiped out.
   The bondholders' minimum demand, according to a committee
member, is that the bank not be seized unless it becomes
insolvent -- generally defined as the moment when a bank's
capital has disappeared.
   "That's not a problem -- we almost never seize banks
before they actually become insolvent," said Ellen Stockdale,
a spokeswoman for the comptroller's office. "But if the
bondholders want a guarantee that we're not going to close
the bank in the near future, they're not going to get it. We
just don't offer those kinds of assurances. If regulators
feel the bank is under water and getting in deeper, they'll
want to close it and not be constrained by some agreement."
   The swap requires board and stockholder approval, and both
groups are expected to clear it. The board, which met
yesterday to discuss the matter, will "continue its analysis
and deliberations in early January," a spokesman said.
   "I think they'll iron out the details and the swap will
happen before the bank goes insolvent," says Gerard Cassidy,
a bank analyst with Tucker Anthony and R.L. Day in Portland,
Maine. "Of course, even a successful swap will only buy them
time for a few quarters. And unless they get a grip on
nonperforming assets and stop the losses, it will only mean a
lease on life until the summer or early fall."
   If the board approves the swap, the bank must receive
regulatory clearance and then mail an offering to
bondholders. Bondholders will have 21 days to respond. Only
if 90% of the bonds are tendered will the deal proceed to its
final stage: shareholder approval of a vast, new issue of
stock to be swapped for the debt.
   The problem is that all this takes time -- a commodity in
short supply these days at Bank of New England. The bank had
a loss of $123 million in the third quarter, shrinking its
capital to a thin $255 million, only 1.1% of total assets of
$23 billion.
   With the weakened real estate market worsened by a
sluggish New England economy, Bank of New England was
struggling under $2.84 million of nonperforming assets,
mostly soured commercial real estate loans, as of Sept. 30.
Carrying costs for that amount of bad assets is about $250
million a year for the bank, which had a $203 million loss in
the first nine months of this year.
   After the Bank of Boston Corp., which had a loss of $255
million in the third quarter, announced last week that it
would report "substantial losses" for the fourth quarter,
analysts began predicting fourth-quarter losses of between
$100 million and $200 million for Bank of New England. Such
losses would push the bank precariously close to insolvency.
   The proposed swap, if successful, would boost Bank of New
England back to safer ground. By getting rid of $706 million
in debt, the bank will save about $60 million a year in
interest payments, and will push its total capital to nearly
3% of total assets, a level regulators ordered the bank to
reach by last spring.
   To be swapped for the $706 million in existing debt would
be $606 million in special preferred stock which soon would
become common stock, and $100 million in new debt that would
require no interest payments and could be redeemed in five
years for cash or equity.
   Of the numerous terms hashed out between the bank and
bondholder representatives in almost six months of
negotiations, only two relatively small provisions remain for
the board's approval, according to officials involved in the
negotiations. One involves the issuing of the $100 million in
new debt. The bank had originally agreed to only $40 million
of such specialized debt, which gives bondholders some
contractual claims on the bank's assets if it is seized or
purchased. The other provision involves releases for the
bank's board members from legal liability if the bank fails.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bank of New England shares slipped 6.25 cents to 68.75 cents.

a share for the fiscal year ending Feb. 2 "may be overly
optimistic by as much as 10 to 12 cents," president Ken
Chilvers said.
   Mr. Chilvers said lackluster holiday sales, particularly
in southern California, required the Irvine, Calif., retailer
of women's apparel to mark down merchandise earlier than
planned.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the year-earlier period, before the company's initial
public offering, Wet Seal earned $5.9 million on sales of
$78.7 million. For the 39 weeks ended Nov. 3, the company had
net income of $6 million, or 56 cents a share, on sales of
$79 million.
   Despite the disappointing holiday results, Wet Seal plans
to build 20 new stores during 1991, mostly in Florida, Mr.
Chilvers added. He noted that the company's five existing
stores in Florida, which opened this year, "have continued to
exceed sales projections."

   Knowledge Data Systems Inc. reported a loss of $104,000,
or 0.4 cent a share, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended
Sept. 30, compared with net of $110,000, or 0.4 cent a share,
in the year-earlier quarter.
   Sales for the quarter fell nearly 30% to $2.8 million from
$4 million a year ago.

   For the year, the Salt Lake City-based company said net
income, on the strength of an agreement with a hospital chain
in Northern California, rose to $377,000, or one cent a
share, compared with a loss of $1.7 million, or seven cents a
share, a year ago.
   The company, which provides data processing systems and
computer software equipment for the health-care industry,
said annual revenue increased 43% to $12.8 million from $8.9
million.
   A spokesman said the increased yearly sales represent a
data system and software package accepted for use at 14
Kaiser Permanente Medical Centers in Northern California. The
medical centers are units of Kaiser Foundation Hospital.

   Icahn Balks on Written Bid,
   Executive Says Suitor
   `Not Prepared to Pursue'

   Merger talks between Pan Am Corp. and Trans World Airlines
grew rockier after Pan Am told TWA owner Carl Icahn, in
effect, to put up or shut up.
   In a letter to Mr. Icahn released late yesterday, Pan Am
Chief Financial Officer Richard Francis said Pan Am has
concluded that TWA "is not prepared to pursue" its Dec. 16
offer to acquire Pan Am after Mr. Icahn balked at putting his
offer in writing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In an interview, Mr. Icahn retorted that he didn't want to
put any new offer in writing because he said Pan Am had used
an earlier written offer he made last fall to strengthen Pan
Am's hand in talks to sell its London routes to United
Airlines parent UAL Corp. "In November we gave them a written
proposal, and never got the courtesy of a call back," Mr.
Icahn said.
   Another sore point appeared to be Monday's disclosure that
Pan Am has received an offer from Pacificorp, a Portland,
Ore., utility, for new financing of the Pan Am Boston-New
York-Washington shuttle, with an agreement to allow Northwest
Airlines parent NWA Inc. to operate the shuttle.
   Pan Am's letter said that if Mr. Icahn wanted to make a
written offer, which could also include a separate bid for
the shuttle, "We would be pleased to consider it and meet
with you if it provides an acceptable basis for further
discussion."
   In a written reply to Pan Am, Mr. Icahn said, "Once again
you have misstated and misunderstood TWA's position. Our
offer to shareholders remains in place, subject to usual and
customary conditions for a transaction of this type." But he
said he remains "ready to meet" with Pan Am.
   One of those conditions, Mr. Icahn added, would be any
adverse change in Pan Am's fortunes, including a possible Pan
Am bankrupcty-law filing for protection from creditors, "a
sale of assets for less than fair value, or defaults in major
borrowings or obligations."
   Pan Am appears to be in constant danger of any number of
such changes, particularly in possible defaults of major
borrowings. It is in talks with one major aircraft leasing
company after failing to make a required payment on 21
wide-body jets.
   One key point of dispute was TWA's insistence that any
interim debt financing to be provided to Pan Am by TWA be in
the form of debtor-in-possession financing.
   Although such financing gives the lender a priority
position among other creditors, it can only be used in a
bankruptcy-law filing seeking protection from creditors.
   The problem with that, according to one person familiar
with the Icahn-Pan Am talks, is that such a filing could
jeopardize any proceeds shareholders receive in the
acquisition. "As proposed, it doesn't give any value for the
shareholders," that person said.
   Mr. Icahn has offered $1.50 a share plus $1 a share in
notes or preferred stock for each of Pan Am's 150 shares
outstanding. Although the cash offer is valued at $225
million, the notes could be worth as little as $30 million
based on the market value of other TWA debt.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Pan Am shares closed at $1.375, up 12.5 cents.

   Your Money Matters:
   When Bond-Buyers Call, It Pays to Stall

   Investors are often cautioned to beware of strangers
trying to sell them securities over the telephone.
   But the same warning goes for investors who receive phone
calls from dealers offering to buy bonds they already own.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dealer may be trying to buy the bonds at cut-rate
prices to resell directly to the issuer at higher prices.
   Even if the dealer is offering what may initially sound
like an attractive price, several bond-market specialists
advise against leaping at the offer. With a little bit of
detective work and comparison shopping, savvy investors may
be able to do even better.
   Bond issuers often need to buy back some of their bonds to
fulfill what is known as a "sinking-fund" requirement. This
refers to a provision in the fine print of many municipal and
corporate bonds requiring or permitting issuers to buy back
some of their bonds at specified intervals before the final
maturity date.
   The risk for unwary investors was brought into sharper
focus by recent charges that a former state-agency official
in Kentucky and his father profited from "misuse of
confidential information" relating to a sinking-fund program.
Several bond specialists say the case involves what are
probably the first indictments charging insider-trading in
municipal bonds.
   The two men, Noble Donald Morse II, who was
secretary-treasurer of Kentucky's Infrastructure Authority,
and his father, Donald Morse, are accused of making about
$7,000 by buying bonds they knew could be resold to the
authority at higher prices. They were indicted by a grand
jury under a state law in late October.
   The Morses have pleaded not guilty. J. Guthrie True, a
lawyer representing them, says a motion has been filed to
dismiss the charges. He says the Kentucky statute is
"unconstitutionally vague, because it fails to define what
constitutes confidential information."
   Typically, issuers subject to mandatory sinking-fund
requirements have a choice of ways to meet them. Often, they
can redeem a certain amount of bonds at a specified price --
such as "par," or the bond's face value -- with holders drawn
by lot. Or they can try to buy enough of their bonds in the
resale market, at lower prices, to fulfill the requirement.
   Several municipalities and companies hire specialists to
contact bondholders directly. The firm writes letters
summarizing the sinking-fund requirement and asks holders if
they would be interested in selling, and, if so, to specify a
price. After the bids come in, the lowest prices are
accepted, usually up to the limit of the sinking-fund
requirement -- although sometimes the agency can buy even
more than that.
   For example, Fiduciary Communications Co. of New York says
it is working on a sinking-fund retirement program for
several issues of New Jersey's Housing Finance Agency, which
subsequently merged with another agency to become the New
Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. About 2,000
bondholders soon will receive letters asking if they want to
sell, and at what price. The letters also will give an 800
number for holders to call.
   Fiduciary recently handled a sinking-fund retirement
program for Kansas City, Mo., special facility airport
revenue bonds issued to help finance a facility for Trans
World Airlines. It received 211 tender offers, of which 167
came from individuals, says Amy Winchell, a vice president of
Fiduciary.
   Large brokerage houses often get involved with
sinking-fund redemptions, too. Usually they act
independently, trying to make a profit for themselves by
contacting large institutions and individual holders to buy
back bonds to resell to issuers.
   What should investors do if they get a call from someone
offering to buy their bonds? First, several traders say, ask
the callers why they want the bonds so badly and whether it's
because of a sinking-fund requirement.
   Frank Scaraggi, an executive vice president at Lehman
Brothers, advises: "Ask whoever is giving you the bid, `Are
you buying these for an active sinker,' that is, for an
issuer that is satisfying a sinking-fund requirement. Then
ask for more information, and any reputable broker should
give you more, including what they think the sinker will
pay."
   Even if the offer still sounds good, don't stop there, Mr.
Scaraggi and many others suggest. Investors should check the
fairness of the price by calling at least two other firms
they trust. Prices often vary widely from one firm to
another, especially on municipal bonds -- and especially for
trades of $25,000 or less.
   Ask for any research reports the firms have on the issuer,
and whether the issuer's credit ratings have changed since
the bonds were issued; these factors can greatly affect the
price. Also check the prospectus or official statement for
details of the bond's sinking-fund requirements.
   In some cases, large bondholders may be able to get more
information by contacting the issuer directly. Some
treasurers say they are willing to explain the intricacies of
their sinking-fund requirements to bondholders -- and even to
steer them to major market-makers in those bonds.
   "The last thing we want to have is a situation where
someone thinks there's no secondary market" for the bonds,
says the treasurer of one municipal agency. On rare
occasions, he says, the agency might even agree to buy back
bonds directly from investors holding large blocks, typically
$100,000 or more.
   Investors who don't want to worry about the intricacies of
sinkers can buy shares of mutual funds and let fund managers
worry about it. Or they can stick to buying U.S. Treasury
bills, notes and bonds, which don't have sinking funds.

   Soviet legislators sat stunned when the president

Gorbachev defended Yanayev with irritation against a series

   SAN FRANCISCO -- A survey of 250 U.S. manufacturers shows
that while most think the economy is in a recession, an
unusually high percentage nonetheless expect modest profit
growth or at least no earnings decline next year.
   The survey indicates that U.S. manufacturers prepared well
in advance for the economic slowdown, according to the firm
that commissioned the poll, Grant Thornton, a San Francisco
based audit, tax, accounting and management consulting
conern.

<TEXT>
   Companies reduced inventories and receivables, started
programs that promised high-yield or short-term paybacks and
invested cautiously, Grant Thornton said. As a result, four
of ten companies expect increased 1991 profits. Another
group, consisting of more than one-third of the respondents,
said they expected earnings about the same as 1990. Only
one-fourth said they expected declining earnings.
   About two-thirds of the companies said the country is in
recession, while another 20% said the nation hasn't yet
entered a downturn but is headed for one in the coming year.
Only eight percent said the likelihood of a recession next
year was dim.
   Manufacturers seem more concerned with the possibility of
inflation cutting into profits than the general downturn.
Four of ten respondents said a higher inflation rate was
likely, while nearly 50% said the rate won't change over the
year. Only 13% said the inflation rate will drop in 1991.
   The telephone survey was conducted between Nov. 26 and
Dec. 4 by the Wirthlin Group, a national opinion research
organization in McLean, Viriginia. The group polled a random
sample of U.S. manufacturers with annual sales between $10
million and $500 million. The firm said the survey has a
margin of error of plus or minus six percentage points.

   Elizabeth Lesly's Nov. 30 editorial-page article "How Your
Realtor Rips You Off" was a tissue of half-truths and
innuendo, and has done serious damage to the reputation of
the National Association of Realtors, its 800,000 members,
and to a profession with an established record of service to
the public.
   The first allegation was that the Boise, Idaho, Board of
Realtors "hurled" a local broker {Ralph Colburn} into
bankruptcy and "drove him out of business" because he
attempted to represent home buyers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Had Ms. Lesly consulted the board or examined the record,
she would have learned that the board's only action was to
send a "private" letter to the broker asking that he not
disparage the integrity of his fellow Realtors in his
advertising. The reporter's charge that the broker was the
victim of association opposition to buyer brokerage is false.
Far from opposing buyer brokerage, the NAR recognizes it as a
primary marketing relationship for the consumer. In fact,
1986 and 1990 NAR surveys indicate that at least one-third of
member firms offer buyer-brokerage services. NAR policy
guarantees buyer-broker access to Multiple Listing Services.
   As regards responsibility for the broker's bankruptcy, it
should be noted that when he closed his business a review of
court records showed his liabilities of about $14,000
exceeded his assets of about $11,000.
   Ms. Lesly's second allegation was that the members of the
National Association control the "marketplace," have a
monopolistic position, and therefore can charge undeservedly
high commission rates. The primary source of her allegation
was identified as Paul Roark, a staff attorney of the Federal
Trade Commission.
   The absurdity of the charge of monopoly is made manifest
by two facts: First, out of the 2,210,085 real estate
licensees in the U.S., only 800,000 are Realtors. Second,
membership in the National Association, and hence, access to
MLS, is available to any licensee willing to subscribe to the
Realtors' Code of Ethics. We are at a loss to understand how
NAR can be accused of being a "monopoly" when everyone
licensed to engage in the real estate business is eligible
and invited to join.
   The irresponsible use of your power and influence has hurt
a lot of hard-working men and women in the real estate
business, and potentially injured those home buyers and
sellers who forgo services of inestimable value to them.

   Multiple Listing Services do not have to be a part of the
National Association of Realtors. Most sellers do, in fact,
know that the commission fees are negotiable. They ask what
the fee is. They do negotiate on the fee. Broker fees
generally range from 3% to 10% and the full range is used
depending on the value of the property and the difficulty in
executing a sale. It is fatuous and irresponsible to attempt
to mislead the public into thinking the average fee should be
closer to 2% of the sale price. The public isn't that stupid.
The marketplace is free enough to cause that to happen if it
were a reality.
   The buyer's broker mode is common. It is not unique as
portrayed. I have used that contractual relationship many
times. I am a Realtor and I am in a MLS.

   Ms. Lesly strongly infers that buyer-brokering is not
allowed by the National Association of Realtors or local real
estate boards. I am a past president of the Flint Board of
Realtors and my associate, who manages our brokerage
department, is the current president. We have been and
continue to be very active in buyer brokering, and we are
also members of our Multiple Listing Service.
   Ms. Lesly obviously did not do her homework. She states,
"Under present law both real estate agents in any
house-buying transaction are bound to do everything in their
power to see that the seller gets the highest price." This is
untrue. A broker cannot represent, in most cases, both buyer
and seller. However, Broker A who lists a property would
obviously be acting as an agent of the seller. Broker B, who
acts as an agent of the buyer and is paid by the buyer, would
not be representing the seller. Ms. Lesly also incorrectly
makes the point that a property placed in the MLS system
requires that both brokers work only for the seller's best
interest. This is completely wrong.

   Congratulations for being willing to print the truth about
damage to consumers due to Realtor monopoly control. Too few
in the media have been willing to risk the roar of the
Realtor lion.
   It's unfortunate you adapted only part of Ms. Lesly's
article from the November issue of the Washington Monthly.
Taking it out of the context of a well-documented piece will
cause many of your readers to miss its import -- that the
real estate business in this country is controlled by a
multibillion-dollar monopoly that has made itself immune from
effective government oversight.
   It's also unfortunate that thousands of real estate
salespeople who continually stream in and out of the business
every year will not recognize that they too are victims as
much as the consumers described by author Sloan Bashinsky in
1984 as "Home Buyers: Lambs to the Slaughter." Sad, but true,
that even those who remain in the business for any length of
time have a general ignorance about the NAR's political
machinations, matched only by their naive belief in the
NAR-generated image propaganda. Therefore, they participate
more or less innocently in the anticompetitive schemes that
drive up consumer costs and limit consumer choices.
   However, many who have observed the industry from within
and without for more than two decades could confirm Ms.
Lesly's facts as consistent with their own experiences. Few
dare to speak out in fear of reprisal. By and large, the NAR
has become a power unto itself, controlling its own
membership and the marketplace through proprietary control of
the Multiple Listing Services. As the Washington Monthly
article shows, NAR's power to intimidate legislators and
regulators by winding up its members to do "grassroots"
lobbying can thwart efforts at reforms in other areas
affecting financial services, appraisal standards and
taxation.
   The FTC has many cases in its files, but refuses to take
any action to protect the rights of brokers to compete or the
rights of consumers to choose alternative services that would
involve any head-on confrontation with the NAR. The FTC's
1983 Report on the Real Estate Industry revealed that state
regulatory agencies function more to protect the industry's
self-interest than to protect the public. Yet very few in
state government (New York is a notable exception) have dared
follow up on that report by taking a hard look at consumer
protection and restraint-of-trade issues.

   Not all real estate agents are out to "rip off" the
public. We take great pride in our work, and we fiercely
represent our principals, be they buyers or sellers.
Sometimes, the commission we get at the end of a transaction
breaks down to less than $2 an hour. As real estate agents,
we work very hard to help our clients (buyers or sellers) get
the best terms and conditions in their purchases. Our work is
not helped by misleading articles that simply feed paranoia.

   Ms. Lesly must have gotten ripped off by a real estate
broker. Every profession has a minority who (in her terms)
"rake in" big commissions and receive "hefty broker fees."
   I am a real estate broker in a medium-size firm. I work
hard. I know the market. Every dollar I earn with knowledge
and scrupulous effort. I am one of the leading brokers in my
office, and this year will earn, not rake in, $33,000, from
18 separate transactions. Some were effortless, most were
arduous.
   Yes, there are dilemmas in my work. Although I share in a
commission paid by the seller at the close of a sale, when I
am with a buyer, working with them day after day after day, I
try to perceive what they want and what they can afford, and
try to negotiate what is best for them and the seller. It
should be a "win-win" situation. I comply with the law and,
in writing, notify "my broker" that I will receive payment by
"sharing" the sales commission paid to the "listing broker."
   The reason we do not have more brokers representing buyers
looking for homes (it is becoming standard practice in
commercial real estate brokerage) is because most buyers do
not want to sign an agreement to work with a broker, and pay
them when they buy. Although it might be in the buyer's best
interest, we have traditionally done otherwise.

   I suspect you will be attacked viciously by the NAR for
printing Ms. Lesly's article. But one never needs to
apologize for the truth and the facts. That position has cost
me, because the ads for which the local Board of Realtors
crucified me read:
   1) "The real estate buyer without his own agent has no
protection in the transaction; he must represent himself just
like a car buyer."
   2) "The buyer's broker is an ally of the buyer rather than
an opponent like he is in most real estate transactions."
   Is that bad advertising? I think not. In fact, the
complaining broker stated during the "hearing": "An attack of
this kind on the industry may have to be tolerated if it
comes from the outside, but not from one of our own members."
   Talk about a thin skin. The warning they gave me to cease
and desist was nothing less than a threat, more like
professional terrorism.

   Census Bureau Adds 3.8 Million to Count
   But Critics Say Millions Remain Missing

   WASHINGTON -- The Census Bureau added 3.8 million more
people to its 1990 headcount, but critics continue to
complain that the bureau is missing millions more.
   The bureau said yesterday that its almost-final tally from
the 1990 census is 249,632,692 people, 10.2% more than the
1980 census found.

   The addition of 3.8 million people to the preliminary
total released this summer reflects 2.9 million residents the
bureau missed the first time as well as the anticipated
922,819 military and other federal employees and dependents
overseas.
   Under the Constitution, the new headcount will result in a
shift of 19 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
   California is the big winner, adding seven seats to give
it 52 representatives, or nearly 12% of all the seats in the
435-member House. New York is the big loser. It will lose
three seats and end up with 31 seats after the 1992 election.
   The 1990 tally includes military and other federal workers
and dependents living overseas. The 1980 tally didn't.
Excluding those people, the resident population of the U.S.
grew by 9.8% during the 1980s, Census Bureau Director Barbara
Bryant said.
   The bureau may yet make additional adjustments to the
tally. Under terms of an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit
brought by New York City and others who argued that the
census disproportionately misses minorities, the Commerce
Department must decide by July 15 whether to adjust the
tallies statistically to compensate for the undercount.
Commerce Undersecretary Michael Darby yesterday called the
1990 census "full, fair and efficient."
   But congressional skepticism persists. "It's not a
question of whether we have counted everyone. The census
never does," said Rep. Thomas Sawyer (D., Ohio), chairman of
the House census subcommittee. "The question is how close
they've come to the truth."
   New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams, among those
suing the bureau, was quick to complain that the 1990 census
still undercounted his state. "When large segments of our
residents are left out of the political process, democracy is
devalued for all of us," he said.
   Additions to the preliminary tally reflect, among other
things, recanvassing of a substantial number of housing units
by census enumerators. With aid from state and local
governments, the bureau also identified about 125,000 housing
units it had missed. It also turned up an extra 400,000
people from parole records, Mrs. Bryant said recently.
   Mr. Darby noted that the new tally is "surprisingly close"
to earlier projections that the census would find a
population of 250 million. But Rep. Sawyer noted that the
249.6 million total is still substantially shy of the
bureau's recent projections, based on demographic data, of
253.4 million.
   The 1990 census confirms trends identified in earlier
reports, such as the rapid growth of the western states. "The
West is the big population gainer," Mrs. Bryant said. In the
past decade, the population of the West has grown by 22%,
while the South grew by 13.5%, the Northeast by 3.4%, and the
Midwest by 1.3%.
   The reassignment of seats in the House reflects these
trends, with the West and Sunbelt states gaining at the
expense of the big industrial states of the Northeast and
Midwest. In addition to California, states adding seats
include Florida, which gains four seats; Texas, which gains
three seats; and Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia
and Washington, which each gain one seat.
   Besides New York, states losing seats include Illinois,
Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which each lose two seats;
and Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Montana, New Jersey and West Virginia, which each lose one
seat.
   None of these shifts comes as a surprise, however. Earlier
bureau reports on the 1990 count pointed to all of them.
   The figures may provide new ammunition for the District of
Columbia's perennially unsuccessful campaign for statehood.
Although the census found that the district lost population
during the 1980s, it still is larger than either Vermont,
Alaska or Wyoming. Yet the district hasn't any seats in the
Senate, and its one representative in the House can't vote.
   The bureau also noted yesterday that four states lost
population in the 1980s. They are Iowa, North Dakota, West
Virginia and Wyoming.
