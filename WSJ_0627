   CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple Computer Inc. named Robert
Puette, longtime leader of Hewlett-Packard Co.'s personal
computer business, as president of its Apple USA division,
effective July 1.
   Mr. Puette, 48 years old, succeeds Allan Z. Loren, who was
forced to resign in a major management shake-up in January.
Mr. Puette will report to Michael Spindler, Apple's former
European sales whiz who was named chief operating officer.
Mr. Spindler has functioned as Apple USA president on an
acting basis in the interim.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Puette takes the reins of an organization which had
become strained by a slowdown in sales, and soured by Mr.
Loren's reported unpopularity with his own staff and computer
dealers.
   In the fiscal year 1989, Apple's U.S. sales grew 20%, half
the rate of its European sales. Moreover, Apple began 1990
with a forecast of little or no domestic growth.
   Mr. Puette's responsibilities will encompass sales,
marketing and support; he will oversee both education and
business markets; and he will manage relations with Apple's
own field sales personnel, as well as third party computer
dealers.
   Analysts weren't surprised that Apple chose to tap outside
talent to fill the post. In Mr. Puette's 24-year career at
Hewlett-Packard, where he most recently held the title of
general manager, Personal Computer Group, he is credited with
the start-up, development and expansion of its global PC
business.
   Mr. Spindler said Mr. Puette brings "the right set of
skills and experience to galvanize Apple's U.S. business in
the coming years."
   Specifically, Mr. Spindler said, those strengths include
his combination of technical expertise and his ability to
manage a large and complex business organization.

   Federal Regulators
   Face New Reversal
   On Shutting Banks

   DALLAS -- In the latest in a series of courtroom reversals
for federal banking regulators, a federal judge here ruled
that several agencies acted illegally in closing some of
Texas American Bancshares Inc.'s banking units last year.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders faulted
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., among others, for
repaying only a fraction of funds owed by Texas American's
lead bank to 13 solvent affiliates after regulators closed
the lead bank last July.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The incomplete repayment caused a chain reaction of
failures in the otherwise solvent banks, allowing the FDIC to
complete a previously negotiated sale of Texas American's
entire bank network to a Dallas investor group.
   But Judge Sanders held that, because some non-affiliated
creditors of the lead bank received 100 cents on the dollar
owed them, the FDIC's action violated a 19th century banking
law requiring that all creditors of a failed bank be treated
equally.
   "The facts of this case indicate an . . . egregious use of
the FDIC's extensive (but not unlimited) powers by
manipulating the recovery of affiliated banks on the
obligations owed to them in order to make those banks
insolvent as well," he wrote.
   The FDIC's liability in the case is minimal: As part of a
negotiated settlement of various legal disputes with Texas
American, the agency had already agreed to pay no more than
$5 million if Judge Sanders ruled against it.
   What's more, Judge Sanders' ruling probably won't have any
impact on future bailouts becauses the 1989 Financial
Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act gave
regulators expanded power to favor one group of creditors
over others.
   The ruling represented a particularly stinging rebuke to
the FDIC, coming, as it did, in the wake of several other
court decisions against banking regulators.
   Just last week, for example, a federal bankruptcy judge
here ruled that the FDIC can't use a $1 billion claim against
First RepublicBank for voting purposes when creditors decide
the fate of the company's plan to emerge from bankruptcty
court proceedings.
   Mark Rosen, a deputy general counsel for the FDIC, said
the agency was "disappointed" by the ruling and is likely to
appeal.
   The decision, if upheld in other cases stemming from past
bailouts, could wind up costing the government hundreds of
millions of dollars. For example, First RepublicBank Corp.,
which lost its 40-bank network in a 1988 federal bailout with
strong parallels to Texas American's, has asserted that 35 of
its banks failed through so-called "manufactured
insolvencies." The Dallas bank holding company, which isn't
related to First Republic Bancorp of San Francisco, claims
that those banks were worth almost $1 billion before they
were sold to NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.

   Enterprise:
   After Entrepreneurial Studies, the Real Learning Begins
   ---
   Graduates Struggle to Get Their
   Prize-Winning Ideas Off the Ground

   About this time last year, Vonn Logan was walking on
clouds. As a 30-year-old M.B.A. student at the University of
Arizona, his plan for a Hawaiian souvenir seafood business
had just been picked as one of three winners in an
entrepreneurial studies program. His uncle was so
enthusiastic that he offered to provide start-up financing,
using the cash flow of his established shrimp wholesaling
business.
   Then the troubles began.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   His uncle's shrimp supplier suddenly redirected its entire
harvest to a competitor. With that business drying up, there
was nothing for seed money. "We were a booming business on
Wednesday, and hadn't any product to sell on Thursday," Mr.
Logan recalls. "That's one thing school didn't prepare me
for: how vicious things could get."
   While entrepreneurial education was once rare, more than
250 colleges and universities now offer it in some form, says
the Association of Collegiate Entrepreneurs. Full-fledged
programs such as the one at Arizona's Karl Eller Center for
the Study of the Private Market Economy, are especially in
vogue. Students in the program develop business plans --
often for enterprises that they hope to start when they
graduate. But how do graduates of entrepreneurial programs
fare when cast adrift on the rough seas of American business?
Can academia prepare them for a shrimp supplier who decides
to sell to a rival?
   Sandra Lenick Olivier, whose business plan for D.L. West
Manufacturing Co., Los Angeles, won the Eller Center's 1986
competition, says an "attitude of perseverance" learned at
the school helped her and her colleagues turn the company
into a profitable, $400,000-a-year maker of hinged
paper-holders for home, office and car. But Ms. Olivier, a
co-owner of the company, says no school could have prepared
her for a few real-world shocks, such as the lightning-fast
changes in consumer markets. "Sometimes you just finish a
brochure and distribute it, and it's already obsolete," she
says.
   The three top prize winners among last year's 35 Eller
Center students -- Mr. Logan, William De Jong of Chicago, and
Dale Deming of Tucson -- haven't gotten as far as Ms. Olivier
yet. In fact, they haven't even managed to get started yet.
They have positioned themselves in the industries they've
targeted for their inventions or ideas, but they have
families to feed as well as dreams to fulfill.
   A look at their journeys so far points up the obstacles
that entrepreneurs -- even those with prize-winning ideas --
face in trying to get started. Still, as good entrepreneurs
must, these young men are holding on to their dreams and
moving to turn them into reality.
                                                                                                       

   WILLIAM DE JONG
                                                                                                       

   Mr. De Jong was drawn to the Eller Center because he
craved more information about how to start a business. He'd
once looked at running his own carwash, but found it
"overwhelming," he says. "I got caught up in all the
different things that had to be done to start a business, and
it died."
   After graduation from Eller he had planned to leave his
job as a welding engineer at Hughes Aircraft Co. and get his
business plan for a different sort of company, Retool Inc.,
rolling right away. His company would resharpen commonly used
industrial tools called endmills, using a computerized
technique designed to extend the life of the tools.
   But the 30-year-old Mr. De Jong, too, has had his start-up
plans sidetracked. He recently did leave Hughes, but for a
job at Ferranti Sciaky, a much smaller, welding equipment
concern in Chicago that had taken an interest in Retool Inc.
during his school days. Working there, he believes, will ease
the shock of going directly from Hughes to the tiny start-up
he envisions Retool eventually will be. "It's kind of
frightening to have all your experience with a large
corporation, and then jump into a two- or three-man company,"
he says.
   Being in the Midwest, Ferranti Sciaky also is close to
both his family and to his eventual market: smaller
manufacturers who use endmills and need a cheaper way to
maintain them.
   He could eventually decide to sell Ferranti his business
plan, which requires $550,000 for start-up. But "most
definitely," Mr. De Jong expects to start either Retool or
another company on his own someday. When that time comes, he
says, the Eller Center's concentration on "the big picture"
will help him. "Even when I deal with concept design now, I
look at how I am going to build it, how I am going to finance
it, and such things as the time-value of money for having the
machinery on my floor without any work to do."
   Today, if he wanted to start that carwash, Mr. De Jong
says, "I would know how to put the business plan together,
and have the confidence to approach people for funding."
                                                                                                       

   VONN LOGAN
                                                                                                       

   There's no question that Mr. Logan was ablaze last year
with his idea -- marketing fresh seafood to Japanese
tourists, whose "omiyage" cultural tradition requires
purchase of special gifts for family and friends. But he and
his wife were also expecting a fourth child soon after his
return to Hawaii. And raising $200,000 to start his proposed
Honolulu Flying Fish Inc. seemed dependent on the help from
his uncle, another in a long line of Logans in the island
fish business.
   As Mr. Logan helped build up the shrimp operation as part
of the agreed-upon incentive program, he worked on his own
packaging design. Packaging, he had decided during his work
at Arizona, "was in a lot of ways just as important as the
product itself." An attractive and clever box "is consistent
with the social obligation" the Japanese feel about gift
giving. Thus, he developed the concept of a fish-shaped,
plastic-foam carrier with a dry-ice compartment designed to
keep the food fresh for the flight back to Japan.
   Then, however, came the sudden shrimp-supply setback at
the company that was to be his financing "angel." Mr. Logan
had to find other work, this time handling distribution for a
shrimp aqua-culture concern. Added to that were some pressing
financial needs as his family grew. Now, though, he feels
pushing back his timetable won't hurt much. As he watches
Japanese spending trends, he says, "I'm developing a good
solid track record in specialty seafood wholesaling."
                                                                                                       

   DALE DEMING
                                                                                                       

   Eller Center administrators say last year's No. 1 student
could become first in the class to put a company in
operation. Mr. Deming wowed judges with a highly developed
proposal to market "Lectrofog," a patented device to suppress
the huge dust clouds trucks create at mine and construction
sites.
   The equipment would fit right onto the giant vehicles, and
direct positively charged water fog at the negatively charged
dust, replacing conventional water spraying. Lectrofogging,
he says, would improve visibility, while helping miners and
builders meet strict environmental dust-control standards.
And it's a system that seems especially suited to his current
employer, Magma Copper Co., for whom he is environmental
control manager.
   But Mr. Deming, too, has opted to slow his drive to
market. "I'm trying to keep it rolling in night-time hours
and on weekends," says the 35-year-old engineer and father of
two.
   He's now negotiating with Magma, he says, about a possible
joint venture and development of a prototype device. A Magma
spokesman says only that dust suppression "is a big cost, and
if there's a way to help in the dust-control area we'd be
very interested."
   But Mr. Deming feels ready to break out on his own if need
be. At school he marketed the system by calling "mining
companies all around the U.S., and they are still very
potential customers," he says. The school's emphasis on
designing complete five-year financial models for start-ups,
including cash-flow statements, helped him.
   Also, before his Arizona studies he says he was "a pretty
shy public speaker {and} wouldn't project myself very well."
But by the final competition, he adds, "I certainly had
turned that around."

   Chase Receives
   S&amp;P Downgrade
   On Debt, Preferred

   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. downgraded Chase
Manhattan Corp.'s debt, including its commerical paper,
citing worsening real estate loans and a weak earnings
outlook.
   The action follows a similar move by Moody's Investor
Service Inc. two weeks ago and affects $7.5 billion in debt
and preferred stock. Most banks have received downgrades in
recent months as loan problems have risen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Chase spokesman said the company was disappointed by the
action.
   All obligations of the parent company were reduced: The
senior debt dropped to single-A-minus from single-A.
Subordinated debt slipped to triple-B-plus from
single-A-minus. The rating on preferred stock fell to
triple-B from triple-B-plus, and the commercial paper rating
was reduced to A-2 from A-1.
   S&amp;P also lowered the ratings on longterm certificates of
deposit and letter of credit-backed issues of Chase's
principal subsidiaries -- Chase Manhattan Bank, Chase/Lincoln
First Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank (USA) -- to single-A/A-1
from single-A-plus/A-1. Short-term ratings for the banks'
certificates and letters of credit remain unchanged.
   Tanya Azarch of Standard &amp; Poor's said Chase's recently
announced plan to cut its annual overhead by $300 million, or
8%, is a positive factor. However, she said problem loans and
a poor earnings outlook leave Chase in a weakened position.
   Chase has $9.8 billion in commercial real estate loans, or
about 13% of its total loan portfolio. Of that sum, about
$1.27 billion is classified as non-performing or past due.
   In addition, the slack demand for corporate lending and
advisory services has clouded Chase's earnings outlook. As a
result, Chase's earnings this year aren't expected to cover
its dividend costs.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Chase
closed at $24.25, up 12.5 cents.

   PITTSBURGH -- National Steel Corp. named Kokichi Hagiwara
chairman and chief executive officer, succeeding Howard M.
Love, who remains honorary chairman.
   The management move reflects the change in ownership of
the steelmaker. National Intergroup Inc., which owned 50% of
National Steel, announced in April its plans to sell all but
10% of its steel equity to NKK Corp. of Japan. Mr. Hagiwara
is a managing director of NKK, while Mr. Love is chairman and
chief executive of National Intergroup. Mr. Love also intends
to step down from National Intergroup next March, once a
restructuring of that company is completed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ronald H. Doerr, National Steel's former executive vice
president, was tapped to succeed Mr. Hagiwara as president
and chief operating officer.
   National Steel also reduced the size of the board to five,
from six, and changed its makeup to give better
representation to NKK. Mssrs. Hagiwara and Love will remain
on the board; they will be joined by the following new
members: Mr. Doerr; Osamu Sawaragi, executive vice president
of NKK, in charge of its Iron &amp; Steel division; and Yoshito
Tokumitsu, National Steel's vice president -- distribution
and services. Mr. Sawaragi will serve as vice chairman.
   In a related move, National Intergroup said it completed
the first stage of its equity steel sale to NKK, by selling
20% of the company to NKK for $146.6 million. As a result,
National Intergroup will record a non-recurring charge of
$14.8 million in the first fiscal quarter ending June 30. The
company had expected a $13 million charge.
   In the year-ago first quarter, National Intergroup earned
$13 million, or 53 cents a share, on sales of $853.4 million.
The year-ago period included a $1.5 million loss from
discontinued operations and a $6 million extraordinary
credit.

   Dresdner Push
   Into East Germany

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Deutsche Bank AG and Dresdner
Bank AG have sewn up their plans to divide the bulk of East
Germany's retail banking system between them, securing a big
lead in the rush for Germany's new market after monetary and
economic union.
   In separate agreements with East Germany's new Deutsche
Kreditbank AG, West Germany's two largest banks found a way
around East Germany's ban on takeovers of state-owned
industry. Though soon to be abolished, the restriction
limiting investment stakes to 49% hampered plans to complete
the bank acquisitions in time for monetary union on Sunday.
Kreditbank comprises the former retail operations of the
Staatsbank banking monopoly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Deutsche Bank is expected to announce today a
joint-venture agreement with Kreditbank that will give it
control over 122 Kreditbank branches, effective Sunday.
Deutsche Bank will take a 49% stake in the venture, which
will be called Deutsche Bank-Kreditbank AG and based in East
Berlin, Deutsche Bank officials said. Kreditbank will hold a
47% interest in the venture. A Deutsche Bank spokesman said
the remaining 4% is to be held temporarily by a group of East
German companies, which is expected to sell their combined
stake to Deutsche Bank once East Germany's majority-ownership
restrictions fall away after Germany's economic merger.
   The system of temporarily parking the crucial stake with
East German companies was the key to the agreement. It
guarantees the West German bank's majority stake while also
providing those East German firms with the promise of a
useful cash reward later on.
   Along with 18 East German branches acquired separately,
Deutsche Bank will have 140 retail outlets operating after
monetary union, with more to be added later. (East German
banks will be open Sunday to act as the official conversion
points for East Germany's changeover from the feeble East
German mark to the West German mark.)
   In a similar arrangement, Dresdner Bank yesterday said it
signed its own joint venture pact with Kreditbank that gives
it control over 72 of Kreditbank's retail outlets. Dresdner
Bank will take a 49% stake in the Dresden-based joint
venture, to be called Dresdner Bank Kreditbank AG, with the
East German bank retaining 47%. Three East German industry
groups, including VEB Carl Zeiss Jena, will hold the
remaining 4% stake.
   Dresdner Bank's 72 Kreditbank branches will be added to
the 35 branches of its own established in East Germany this
year. Dredner plans to have more than 150 branches in East
Germany by the end of 1991.

   Beware Soviet-German Friendship

   One of the most revealing meetings in the current flurry
of consultations to remap Europe took place at Brest-Litovsk.
Mikhail Gorbachev's foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze,
conducted a long and private discussion there on the future
of Germany with the West German foreign minister,
Hans-Dietrich Genscher. That the Soviet statesman chose this
particular site to host his colleague is an ominous sign. In
1918, Brest-Litovsk was the place where Russia and Germany
designed the separate peace that laid the foundation for more
violence in this century. A new "Brest-Litovsk" portends a
new -- and dangerous -- Soviet-German relationship.
   The visible collapse of communism and American concern
about "helping" President Gorbachev in his hour of need seem
to have caused us to forget some important history. We are
overlooking the long story of Russian -- and then Soviet --
expansion, the special relationship between Russia and
Prussia, and, after 1871, with united Germany. Russia and the
Soviet Union have been major factors in the European and the
world balance of power since the time of Peter the Great.
Like Britain, Russia often changed allies. Bismarck said
Russia was a "mastodon" and had to be handled carefully.
While Germany was Austria's ally, Bismarck cultivated a
"Reinsurance Treaty" with Russia in order to protect
Germany's rear in case of trouble with Britain or France.
After Bismarck was dismissed by Wilhelm II in 1890, the
Kaiser let the Reinsurance Treaty lapse. The Kaiser's
decision was an important factor in the tragedy of 1914.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ambivalent connection between Russia and Prussia was
manifest at many other critical moments. The Hitler-Stalin
Pact, which set off World War II, was not an aberration. The
first agreement concluded at Brest-Litovsk had these
consequences: Russia made a separate peace with Germany at
the expense of its allies. Seventy German divisions were then
shipped to the Western front for the great German offensive
of 1918 -- if America had not entered the war, Germany surely
would have won. After the war, Lenin invited the Germans to
train officers and build planes and produce other munitions
secretly in Russia. Mr. Shevardnadze even had the gall
publicly to underline the significance of the meeting place,
in case any Western foreign office missed the point.
   Against this background, how should we view Mr.
Gorbachev's unresolved difference with President Bush about
the future of Germany? Is Mr. Gorbachev really driven by
anxiety about a possible attack by a non-nuclear Germany
against the Soviet Union, a nuclear superpower?
   Mr. Gorbachev's effort to neutralize Germany is consistent
with another and far more plausible hypothesis: That whatever
his subjective intentions may be, the natural consequences of
the policy he proposes would enable the Soviet Union to
snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. It would give Mr.
Gorbachev what NATO, for the past 40 years, has prevented: A
neutral and indefensible Central Europe open to Soviet
domination. Such an outcome would soon prove an irresistible
temptation to an ambitious Soviet ruler. What is at stake in
Mr. Gorbachev's bold gamble is nothing less than the future
of the world balance of power and the outcome of the Cold
War.
   For more than 40 years, this has been the principal goal
of Soviet strategy. Soviet proposals of this kind have been
put forward with depressing regularity ever since the Soviet
leaders rejected America's Baruch Plan for the international
control of nuclear energy in 1946. The Rapacki Plan is the
best known of Soviet "peace" plans. It was offered in 1957
and is often revived. It proposed to establish a nuclear-free
zone comprising both Germanies, Poland and Czechoslovakia --
a zone where nuclear weapons could not be manufactured,
stored or used.
   Sometimes the Soviet Union offers the Western Allies a
non-aggression pact as well as a proposal for
denuclearization and neutrality. Secretary of State Dean
Acheson said about one early ploy, "we already have a
non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. It is called the
Charter of the United Nations and nothing should be done to
qualify the force of its generality." The non-aggression pact
Mr. Gorbachev has recently dangled before Western eyes hardly
represents new thinking. It should be rejected out of hand.
   The most striking change Mr. Gorbachev has brought about
in Soviet foreign policy is to make European neutrality an
immediate and urgent objective, rather than a distant and
theoretical hope. In this perspective, Mr. Gorbachev's
decision not to use force to suppress the revolutions in
Eastern Europe becomes intelligible. Such an attempt would
have postponed and perhaps ruined his efforts to obtain
economic help from the West. And it might well have provoked
civil disorder at home; desertions and mutiny by his own
troops on a much larger scale than the defections of Soviet
troops in Hungary in 1956; and even NATO intervention. Was it
perhaps Mr. Gorbachev's conclusion that it was better for him
to allow East Europe to go free, and then trump the Western
ace by neutralizing the whole of Europe, East and West
together?
   A neutral Germany, a country of 85 million people, would
destroy NATO, force the U.S. to withdraw from Europe to
Fortress America, and leave Britain, France, Italy, Spain,
Turkey and the smaller countries of Europe incapable of
self-defense. The American nuclear guaranty would lose all
credibility. Without American backing, the British and French
nuclear forces would remain too small to deter the Soviet
Union, which would then be the only major nuclear power in
Europe. Western Europe would be "Finlandized" -- a neuter in
world politics. The U.S. could no longer mobilize allied
coalitions to help deal with crises like those in Korea, the
Persian Gulf or the Middle East.
   With or without Japan, a helot Western Europe would be the
inevitable milch-cow of Soviet economic recovery. No scenario
for the future could be more threatening to the U.S. than the
modernization of the Soviet Union in partnership only with
Germany or with Western Europe as a whole rather than with
the Western nations as a group.
   Given Mr. Gorbachev's overwhelming need for Western
economic help and the turbulence of Soviet society, no such
eventuality can materialize if Western policies are even
moderately rational. But concerted and active allied
diplomacy will be required to counter Mr. Gorbachev's bid.
But there is no sign as yet that the West has even
contemplated a policy commensurate with the situation.
Instead, the Western nations seem willing to help the Soviet
Union piecemeal, without obtaining any quid pro quo in
return.
   Many believe that the problem isn't serious because if the
Soviet Union becomes capitalist, it will no longer be
expansionist. But capitalism doesn't always bring peaceful
democracy. Take Germany, which was extremely capitalist both
in 1914 and in 1939. So was Japan. Popular governments in
pluralist societies have committed aggression in the past,
and dictatorships have been peaceful neighbors. Arms control
agreements, improvements in human rights, the adoption of
multiparty elections and a market economy, however desirable
in themselves, should not be regarded as a sufficient
consideration for Western economic cooperation on the scale
that will be required. Peace is a separate matter.
   At the moment, the key question is whether a united
Germany should continue to be a member of NATO or withdraw.
If Mr. Gorbachev's goal is peace, it is as much in Moscow's
interest as ours that Germany remain firmly anchored in the
West. This is not a subject on which Mr. Bush can compromise.
   After what we had to endure since 1945, it would be
unimaginably foolish for the U.S. and its allies to help
Russia modernize and enlarge its fantastic military
capabilities without insisting on a clear end of the Cold War
and the achievement of real peace -- not a new detente, a
"modus vivendi", or a wary cooling off period, but a regime
of genuine peace.

   Will Regional-Brokerage Rally Fade?

   Some Managers
   Begin a Pullback

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Many regional brokerage stocks have sizzled
this year, far outpacing the shares of big securities firms.
But some money managers think the runup may be over.
   Based far from Wall Street, regionals are smaller brokers
that focus more on clients around the corner than around the
world. Three big winners -- Alex. Brown, Raymond James
Financial and Legg Mason -- each have soared about 30% this
year, while bigger brokerage stocks have been flat.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But while the long-term outlook for regionals still is
bright, now isn't the time to plow in, some managers warn.
   Because regional brokers are heavily dependent on the
activity of individual investors, their stocks are often
viewed as a proxy of small-investor interest in the stock
market. And with the regionals' runup, and no strong signs
that individual investors have stormed back to stocks in a
big way, some managers have recently pared back their
holdings of regionals' shares.
   Jeffrey Vinik, portfolio manager for the $510 million
Fidelity Contrafund, says he has "significantly" cut his
position in Raymond James and A.G. Edwards in recent weeks.
Regionals "went from being great buys to solid holds," he
says. "In terms of buying, I'd wait until they're cheaper."
   Lawrence Eckenfelder, a brokerage-industry analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities, sees another potential pitfall:
The continued sluggish volume at the nation's stock
exchanges. The Big Board has averaged just 156.5 million
shares a day this year, down 17% from its 1987 peak.
   "What's going to happen if volume stays as it's been, and
we don't see much sequential improvement in {regionals'}
earnings?" Mr. Eckenfelder asks. "People will start to chip
away" at the stocks. He says the phone calls he's been
getting on regionals lately have been from investors thinking
about selling to lock in their profits.
   That should give pause for investors still hoping to cash
in on the much-ballyhooed regional-firm resurgence. While big
national securities firms such as Shearson Lehman Hutton and
Merrill Lynch have faltered since the 1987 stock-market
crash, several regional firms have recently posted record
profits. Regional brokers have been helped by a modest pickup
in individual investor interest in stocks, and by regionals'
healthy investment advisory operations, particularly mutual
funds.
   Regionals also have a head start on the national firms in
cutting costs and focusing on a few profitable businesses.
"These firms never got fat and happy," says Preston Athey,
who runs the $32 million T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value Fund.
   Mr. Athey still believes regionals are cheap. Raymond
James currently sells at about eight times trailing 12-month
earnings and Legg Mason at about 11.5, he points out; Alex.
Brown trades at "only" a 40% premium to book value. But
"they're no longer on the screaming bargain basement table,"
he concedes.
   And regional brokers aren't "widow and orphan" stocks
either, Mr. Athey warns. They are volatile; like most
brokerage stocks, they tend to outperform stock-market
averages in good markets and underperform in bad. And because
most regionals are small stocks with a modest number of
shares outstanding, it doesn't take much to move them.
Regional brokerage stocks fell out of bed during the 1987
crash.
   Indeed, some top portfolio managers steer clear of
regional brokers because of their turbulence. Harry Hutzler,
who runs the $660 million AIM Weingarten Fund, says he no
longer buys regionals after being burned in past years on
Legg Mason. "With many other types of stocks, good earnings
tend to persist,"he says, but "not with regional brokerage
stocks."
   Even the most bullish managers aren't betting more money
on regional brokers. Steven Barry, co-manager of the $350
million Alliance Quasar Fund, says these shares could soar if
small investors return to stocks in a big way. But that
hasn't happened yet. Meanwhile, "I don't want to have a big
exposure here," he says.
   Regional brokerage firms can't be painted with the same
brush, of course. Here's how some money managers view the
prospects for three recently-hot regional brokers:
                                                                                                       

   ALEX. BROWN: One of the largest of the regionals, the
Baltimore-based firm has a solid clientele of wealthy
individuals and institutions. Alex. Brown also is active in
investment banking, and maintains a strong presence in the
market for initial public offerings; the recent surge in IPOs
has been one reason the stock has risen lately. Add its
strength in technology stocks -- another recent Wall Street
darling -- and it's not hard to see why T. Rowe Price's Mr.
Athey dubs it the "regional Morgan Stanley."
                                                                                                       

   LEGG MASON: Also based in Baltimore, Legg Mason depends
heavily on small investors. One of its strengths is a
well-defined money-management side; its highly regarded Legg
Mason Value Trust helps the firm draw assets. Shearson Lehman
analyst Dean Eberling calls Legg Mason an "asset manager
disguised as a regional broker." Mr. Eberling thinks the
stock is undervalued on a price-to-book basis when its book
value is adjusted to reflect an estimated $3.75 a share
addition for its Western Asset Management unit relative to
what Legg paid for it in 1986.
                                                                                                       

   RAYMOND JAMES FINANCIAL: This firm, based in St.
Petersburg, Fla., also is heavily dependent on individual
investors and has a burgeoning money-management arm. It does
a big business in stocks of small local companies,
particularly those based in Florida. One reason Fidelity's
Mr. Vinik has pared his holding is Raymond James's recently
stated intention to slow its growth. "They want to keep
things under control," Mr. Vinik says.
   ---
   Competitive pressures bearing down on the New York Stock
Exchange are disrupting the exchange's clubby atmosphere.
   Witness the recent election of Benjamin F. Edwards III,
the chairman and chief executive of regional broker A.G.
Edwards, to the exchange's board of directors.
   Mr. Edwards received the lowest number of votes of any
director on the uncontested slate, after his name was crossed
off by members casting 23 out of a total of 793.5 votes on
the June 7 ballot, according to an exchange member who has
seen the results.
   The member said it was unusual that a selection of the
nominating committee was controversial enough to compel a
number of members to strike a name.
   Members attribute the gesture to unhappiness that regional
brokers such as A.G. Edwards and Quick &amp; Reilly send some
orders away from the exchange. A.G. Edwards sends some trades
to off-exchange trader Bernard L. Madoff. Not only does A.G.
Edwards earn commissions on the trades, but it also receives
a penny-per-share rebate from Mr. Madoff. However, sending
orders away from exchanges reduces the stock market's
efficiency, Big Board members argue.
   Mr. Edwards says he doesn't think the vote was
significantly unfavorable. He added, "New York is still the
best market in the world, and we still favor them. But we
feel they have to be competitive."

   Donald Trump's bankers agreed in principle on a five-year
$65 million bailout plan for the developer, and lent him $20
million immediately so he could meet a midnight deadline on a
$43 million bond payment.
   The 30-day bridge loan, made by Mr. Trump's major banks,
also will give the banks time to complete the paperwork on
the bailout agreement. Under terms of the accord, the $20
million bridge loan must be repaid before Mr. Trump would
receive the $65 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   News of the bridge loan boosted the junk bonds of three
casinos operated by Mr. Trump
   With his acceptance of the banks' plan, Mr. Trump now
embarks on what will almost certainly be a long and difficult
restructuring of his empire.
   Under the rescue plan, the banks would suspend interest
payments on about $800 million of Mr. Trump's $2 billion in
bank debt. But he would continue to have to pay interest on
his $1.3 billion in bond debt, as well as on all or part of
his mortgages on the Trump Tower, Trump Shuttle, Plaza Hotel
and Grand Hyatt properties.
   The agreement would also exact wrenching changes in the
way Mr. Trump does business and could require him to live
much more modestly than has been his practice. In addition to
being kept on a strict personal budget, he probably would be
required to appoint a chief financial officer and to replace
some top executives.
   One person now being considered by Mr. Trump for a top
executive position is Victor Palmieri, a so-called workout
specialist whose relationship with Mr. Trump dates back to
the 1970s. Such people specialize in restructuring crippled
companies.
   "People will be retained according to how much money they
can bring in," said one banker involved in the negotiations.
   The commercial banks have also explored retaining an
investment bank to monitor Mr. Trump's three Atlantic City,
N.J., casinos, and they already are pushing for major asset
sales. In effect, said more than one banker, Mr. Trump will
experience the equivalent of a bankruptcy-law restructuring
without involving a bankruptcy judge.
   "I want to thank all of my banks and lending institutions
for making this complex and highly technical agreement
possible," Mr. Trump said in a statement. "I have gained a
great and deep respect for the banking system and those who
make it work."
   The immediate effect of the deal was to enable Mr. Trump
to make his $43 million payment of principal and interest on
Trump's Castle casino bonds. If he had failed to make the
payment, bondholders could have foreclosed on the property.
   In fact, one person familiar with the negotiations said,
Mr. Trump already is in technical default on a number of bank
loans because yesterday's bond payment was 10 days late.
Covenants in a number of his bank loans require that Mr.
Trump remain current on all of his obligations. However,
because Mr. Trump is in the midst of a restructuring, those
defaults are not expected to have a major impact on his
banking relationships.
   While the $20 million bridge loan was anticipated,
yesterday's action was still filled with high drama, as a
number of banks that had agreed to the deal appeared to waver
at midday. The money was not wired to the bond trustee until
5:30 p.m., said one participant in the negotiations.
   Even as Mr. Trump spent from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. signing
document after document in the law offices of Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, which represents Bankers Trust Corp.,
bankers were scurrying to get the final approvals from
recalcitrant banks.
   Three banks, units of Bank of New England, First National
Bank of Chicago and Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co.,
eventually agreed to the deal. It is unclear whether the
three banks will renew their opposition after the Trump's
Castle bond payment is made and the banks start tackling the
mountains of additional paperwork.
   The most notable holdout, West Germany-based Dresdner
Bank, still has not agreed to the proposal, but after
insisting all lenders had to be on board, a person involved
in the negotiations said the deal could get done without
Dresdner.
   Mr. Trump's statement expressed confidence that the final
proposal would be approved. "This agreement allows the Trump
Organization to go strongly forward and reflects and confirms
the inherent long-term value of our assets including Trump
Tower, the Plaza Hotel, the Atlantic City hotels and the
Trump Shuttle," Mr. Trump said in his statement. "The
agreement demonstrates the confidence of the banking group in
the company's ability to maximize the value of those assets."
   The $20 million was supplied by seven of Mr. Trump's major
creditors. Units of Bankers Trust, Chase Manhattan Corp.,
Citicorp, First Fidelity Bancorp, Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
and National Westminster PLC provided $3 million each;
Midlantic supplied $2 million.
   Bankers said they hope to have the paperwork for the $65
million loan completed within 30 days, but they have given
themselves two 30-day extensions in case it is not completed.
Presumably, there are provisions for extending the loan as
well.
   After the final deal is signed, said one banker, "the real
work begins for Donald."
   That work will involve improving on some of the
unprofitable deals Mr. Trump embarked on in the past two
years. Purchases of such unprofitable assets as the Trump
Shuttle and Plaza Hotel were made within the past two years,
when Mr. Trump enjoyed the status of a celebrity mogul, whose
name added value to his properties.
   Unfortunately for Mr. Trump, market forces beyond his
control tightened his access to capital at the precise time
he realized a cash shortage. His well-publicized marital
troubles focused unwanted attention on him, and his
successful attempt to have a critical casino analyst fired
also was interpreted by some bankers as a sign that he could
be under financial strain.
   Finally, the banks were tipped to potential trouble in the
Trump empire in April when he disclosed that he had attempted
either to refinance or sell almost every one of his major
assets, including the Trump Shuttle. The carrier has incurred
losses of almost $100 million since Mr. Turmp purchased it
last year. The airline's president, Bruce Nobles, said the
Shuttle has yet to receive any offers from potential
purchasers.

   Mandela Thanks Congress for Sanctions
   But Repeats Request for Aid to the ANC

   WASHINGTON -- Anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela asked a
joint session of Congress to support financially the African
National Congress effort to bring democracy to South Africa.
   "Our people demand democracy. Our country, which continues
to bleed and suffer pain, needs democracy," he said in a
35-minute speech that was interrupted by applause 18 times.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In his appearance on Capitol Hill, Mr. Mandela, ANC deputy
president, thanked Congress for the sanctions legislation
"which made such a decisive contribution to the process of
moving our country forward towards negotiations."
   He said it was encouraging to know that Congress and the
Bush administration agree "that sanctions should remain in
place. The purpose for which they were imposed has not yet
been achieved."
   Under U.S. law, the economic sanctions that were imposed
in 1986 will remain in place until certain conditions are
met, including a full lifting of the South African state of
emergency and the release of political prisoners.
   But Mr. Mandela urged the lawmakers to "go further and
assist us with the material resources which will enable us to
promote the peace process and meet other needs which arise
from the changing situation you have helped bring about."
   Mr. Mandela did not ask Congress for a specific amount of
money. Congress already has approved a total of $42 million
to assist efforts to develop democracy in South Africa.
   After the speech, House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of
Georgia said Mr. Mandela's refusal to renounce violence along
with earlier comments supportive of Cuba, Libya and the
Palestine Liberation Organization "dooms any plausible
chance" of U.S. aid to the ANC. The South African activist
has said leaders of Cuba and Libya and the PLO backed the
ANC's anti-apartheid struggle when the U.S. wouldn't.
   Mr. Gingrich called yesterday's speech more "balanced"
than Mr. Mandela's earlier statements.
   Democratic Whip William Gray of Pennsylvania said Mr.
Mandela's earlier comments wouldn't hurt efforts to provide
funds to the ANC. "Most members of Congress, except the
radical right, will recognize this is a fight against
apartheid, a fight against racism," he said.
   Mr. Mandela asked President Bush Monday for financial
assistance but was told the U.S. would not contribute
directly to a political party, according to a state
department official. The ANC could receive U.S. funds, if it
renounces violence in the course of negotiations, through the
National Endowment for Democracy, a privately administered
but publicly funded organization that promotes democracy
around the world.
   Included in the House chamber were members of President
Bush's cabinet, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the diplomatic
community. They joined with Mr. Mandela's supporters in
giving him a standing ovation when he said: "Peace will not
come to our country and region until the apartheid system is
ended."
   Invoking the names of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson
and Abraham Lincoln, as well as figures in the fight for
black rights in the U.S., Mr. Mandela attempted to assure the
lawmakers that they would be comfortable with a South Africa
led by the ANC.
   He said that the ANC is struggling "to ensure that the
rights of every individual are guaranteed and protected
through a democratic constitution, the rule of law, an
entrenched bill of rights, which should be enforced by an
independent judiciary, as well as a multiparty political
system."
   The organization is not wedded to nationalization,
according to Mr. Mandela, who added that some government
intervention will be necessary to bolster the economy and
make it more equitable.
   He said it was a given "that the private sector is an
engine of growth and development, which is critical to the
success of the mixed economy we hope to see in the future
South Africa."

   Farm Credit System
   Is Still in Fine Fettle

   Your June 1 editorial about government-sponsored
enterprises raised some decent points about "GSEs" in
general, but erred significantly about the Farm Credit System
in particular.
   You claim "the Farm Credit System got into trouble after
1971, when Congress gave it permission to broaden and expand
its lending to non-farm rural homeowners and liberalized loan
requirements to farmers." First, our rural home-mortgage
program, limited by law to communities under 2,500 people,
actually performed quite well throughout that period and had
nothing whatever to do with our financial problems. Second,
the Farm Credit System was profitable throughout the 1970s
and "got into trouble" in the early 1980s for macroeconomic
reasons, particularly high interest rates and the disastrous
plunge in farmland values that devastated so much of rural
America.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As a single-purpose lender restricted to agriculture and
the largest originator of real-estate loans to farmers, the
fate of Farm Credit was -- and is -- inextricably tied to the
health of the national farm economy.
   You also try to link the Farm Credit System to the current
S&amp;L debacle. Two big differences: With Farm Credit, there was
never any hint of fraud or deceit behind our financial
problems; and with Farm Credit, the assistance will be
repaid. Congress authorized up to $4 billion in bonds for the
system, of which less than half is likely to be needed. As
U.S. farms are recovering, so too is the Farm Credit System.
   Finally, you ignored the fact that Farm Credit already has
in place most of the key elements recommended in the Treasury
Department's GSE report: A strong and independent "safety and
soundness" regulator (the Farm Credit Administration), which
is financed by system institutions, not by taxpayers;
risk-based, permanent capital standards (similar to or
greater than those for federally chartered banks); a
system-financed insurance fund to protect against default;
and tighter management that has cut operating costs.
   The real wild card is Treasury's blithe demand for
triple-A bond ratings for GSEs, absent "agency status." The
truth is, Treasury does not know what would be necessary for
GSEs to attain a triple-A rating, and ignores completely how
this might affect the cost of funds and loss of credit to
sectors served by GSEs. For anyone who cares about
agriculture, housing and education, that issue needs to be
explored fully before rushing to judgment.

   Any Time It's Swan Lake and Not
   Swan Song Is Good News for Him

   MOSCOW -- Mikhail Gorbachev may be facing a rising tide of
public criticism at home, but some Soviets still love him --
and they are starting to make a song and dance about it.
   Yesterday evening, about 2,000 Soviets and a smattering of
bewildered tourists turned up at Moscow's Bolshoi theater to
celebrate the inauguration of the Mikhail Gorbachev
International Fan Club.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I met some American millionaires in El Paso recently and
they said to me: We all love your leader Gorbachev, how come
so many of you Soviets don't like him?" said Sofia Golovkina,
head of a Moscow ballet school and one of the club's
organizers. "Mikhail Sergeyevich gave us freedom; so we
thought, let's set up a supporters' club."
   Mr. Gorbachev himself apparently likes the idea of a fan
club, although he disappointed many by not turning up in
person at the Bolshoi for the rather low-key celebration.
There were no "I love Gorby" hats, stickers or buttons, and
little of the euphoria that surrounds the Soviet leader on
his trips abroad.
   Instead, some of Mrs. Golovkina's most promising young
students danced scenes from Swan Lake and other ballets for
an audience that included the head of the KGB and a few other
senior officials. Yevgeny Primakov, a Gorbachev confidant and
member of the newly created Presidential Council, opened the
evening with a short speech bringing Mr. Gorbachev's personal
message of thanks. "We are in a complex situation," Mr.
Primakov said, "we need to consolidate society to defend
perestroika and glasnost and support our leader, Mikhail
Sergeyevich."
   The club was actually formed in February, but the
organizers only decided to go public now, just as Mr.
Gorbachev's political fortunes seem at a low ebb. Opinion
polls show public discontent with Mr. Gorbachev is reaching
an all-time high.
   The fan club's organizers claim to have three million
members throughout the nation and lots of money. Still, they
only managed to fill about half the Bolshoi's seats, even
though they sent out thousands of invitations. Some of the
tourists in the audience, who bought tickets from scalpers
outside thinking they were just going to see a ballet, seemed
a little bewildered by the fuss. After listening to Mr.
Primakov's remarks, one bearded Danish tourist leafed through
his program and then turned to his neighbor with a puzzled
expression. "What's all this about?" he asked.

   WASHINGTON -- In a deliberately unassuming four-sentence
statement released yesterday morning, President Bush
abandoned his longtime pledge of "no new taxes," immediately
changing the national debate from whether taxes will be
raised to whose taxes will be raised.
   The carefully worded statement listed "tax revenue
increases" as one of the elements necessary for budget
deficit reduction. White House officials refused to
elaborate. But clearly, the president now is ready to
negotiate a budget deal with Congress that could include new
or higher taxes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite White House efforts to play it down, the message
hit here like a bombshell. Barely an hour before the
statement was released, for example, the American Trucking
Association's executive committee had assured its members
that the odds of a fuel-tax increase this year were no better
than one in three. Then came the news release. "We're all a
lot more worried than we were a few minutes ago," said
Kenneth Simonson, staff economist for the group.
   Thus, the first great economic and political debate of the
1990s is now under way: How should government redistribute
the tax burden?
   Republicans, who have been making political hay portraying
Democrats as big taxers, were quick to suggest that if taxes
must rise, the targets should be gasoline, alcohol and
tobacco -- taxes that can be disguised as "user fees."
Democrats snapped back that those taxes would hit low-income
people especially hard. Sen. James Sasser, the Tennessee
Democrat who chairs the powerful Senate Budget Committee, had
his own idea: Sock it to the rich.
   The likely result is a combination of both, something that
satisfies everyone -- sort of -- by hurting everyone. Alcohol
and tobacco taxes are at the top of the hit list, and
gasoline and environmental-cleanup taxes may not be far
behind. Excise taxes, after all, seem to be the easiest way
to close the budget gap.
   But in return, Democrats will demand that the top tax rate
on the very wealthy be increased. A deepening reaction to the
Reagan-era tax cuts of the 1980s leads many to demand an
increase in taxes for high-income people.
   "What you have now is a growing middle-class awareness
that their load is high, and maybe even higher, than the
people at the top," says Kevin Phillips, a political
consultant who has just written a book about the politics of
wealth and poverty.
   Some Republicans tried to argue yesterday that the
president's comments were nothing new. "Tax revenue
increases," they noted, could refer to the $14 billion in
additional income -- from tougher tax-collection enforcement,
for instance -- that's already included in the president's
budget. "The statement as issued doesn't reflect a
significant change in Republican policy," said Rep. Newt
Gingrich, the House Republican whip.
   But even fervent anti-tax Republicans acknowledged that
the president now appears willing to leave his emphatic
campaign pledge behind. "It's bad news, but not surprising
news," said Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think-tank. From the moment that
Mr. Bush began the summit talks on the budget with
congressional leaders on May 15, "the White House was
prepared to capitulate on taxes," he said.
   While the remaining budget negotiations are certain to be
long and difficult, the best estimate now is that the budget
summit, if successful, will produce a package of about $50
billion in deficit reductions. Of that about half -- $25
billion -- may come from increased taxes.
   Some administration officials have privately acknowledged
they'd be willing to accept higher taxes on so-called "sin"
items, notably alcohol and tobacco. That move could raise as
much as $10 billion a year. And polls suggest the American
public might go along. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News
poll, for instance, shows 83% of voters would favor
increasing alcohol and tobacco taxes if the government had to
have a tax increase.
   Gasoline taxes are also high on the agenda, along with
other environment and energy-related taxes that would spread
the costs even wider -- a "BTU tax" on all energy
consumption, for instance; an oil-import fee, or a
carbon-based fuel that would hit heating oil, coal and
natural gas, as well as gasoline. Such fuel taxes raise a lot
of money -- a 25-cent a gallon gasoline tax would bring in
$25 billion, for instance -- and they have the added benefit
of helping the environment. "If you're going to raise
revenues you might as well do some collateral good," says
Rep. Tom Downey, a Democratic member of the Ways and Means
Committee.
   But raising fuel taxes is distinctly less popular than the
idea of sticking it to the rich. The Wall Street Journal/NBC
News poll in May found that in a choice between increasing
income tax rates for upper-income Americans and increasing
the gasoline tax, 68% favored hitting the rich, while only
28% preferred paying more for fuel.
   Higher gasoline taxes are also much less popular than
alcohol and tobacco taxes -- though even such products figure
in the debate over the fairness of the tax burden. In
Chicago, a coalition of labor unions and alcohol and tobacco
companies has already prepared a hard-hitting advertising
campaign that would portray such a tax increase as a kick to
the pocketbook of the working person.
   One ad shows tuxedo-clad men getting out of a very
expensive automobile. "This is a Rolls Royce Corniche
convertible," the announcer says. "If you're a
multimillionaire, you can buy one for $200,000." Then the
camera turns to a bottle of beer. "Sixty-five cents," the
announcer says. "Regular people enjoy them in their backyards
on hot summer days. . . . Guess which one the government
wants to tax now?"
   The group tested the ads in six medium-sized television
markets in February and found an impressive impact. Before
the ads aired, 55% of respondents opposed a beer-tax
increase; afterward, the opposition level rose to 66%.
   William Berman of the American Automobile Association
notes that even Mr. Bush has argued gasoline taxes are unfair
to the poor. In a letter written to the group during the 1988
campaign, Mr. Bush said, "a gas tax increase to balance the
budget would particularly hurt lower wage earners, families
with both spouses working, and farmers and residents of
Western states who have to drive long distances."
   The administration is likely to magnify the criticism by
also insisting on cutting the tax on capital gains. Although
that might have the virtue of raising revenue in the short
term, the vast majority of the tax benefits would go to those
earning $100,000 a year or more.
   Democrats have already begun their counterattack. "Any
Bush tax initiative," Rep. Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey
Democrat, said on the floor of the House yesterday, "is
certain to include new privileges and tax breaks for the
wealthy."
   To address their concerns about tax fairness, Democrats
are insisting any tax package eliminate the so-called bubble
in the current tax rate structure. Under current law, a 33%
rate is imposed on single people's taxable income between
about $47,000 and $97,000, and on joint filers' between
$78,000 and $162,000. The rate then falls back to 28% on
income above those levels. The Democrats insist that in
return for a capital-gains cut, the 28% rate should be
increased.
   The Bush administration and its allies say they remain
adamantly opposed to any increase in federal income-tax
rates. "I don't think you can give up on marginal rates,"
said Mitch Daniels, president of the Hudson Institute and
former political aide in the Reagan White House. "I wouldn't
give up on the bubble."
   But even the White House's Democratic ally on the capital
gains tax cut, Rep. Ed Jenkins of Georgia, believes the top
rate is likely to increase as part of a trade-off for capital
gains. "If you are going to raise those top rates anyway, you
ought to get something for it, like capital gains," he said.
   Mr. Phillips, the political consultant, argues that the
post-Reagan push for more taxes on the wealthy is already
evident in a number of states. He points to New Jersey Gov.
James Florio's tax package, which doubles the top income-tax
rate in that state from 3.5% to 7%. And he notes that in
California, the Democratic chairmen of the senate and
assembly revenue committees favor raising that state's top
tax bracket to 11% from 9.3%.
   Moreover, a number of states, including New York,
Connecticut and Massachusetts, are looking at new taxes on
certain professional services, such as management consulting,
advertising and public relations. Mr. Phillips says that
these moves, too, constitute an effort to shift more of the
tax burden to the upper-income brackets.
   To be sure, no one in Washington even hints of a return to
the pre-Reagan days when the top tax rate rose as high as
70%. Some, such as New York Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer,
say the goal is to make the tax structure somewhat more
progressive -- tilted more to the poor and less to the
wealthy -- than it is now. Others say their aim is only to
hold the line against a further shift in a regressive
direction.
   But in any event, it's clear that tax "fairness" has
become a rising concern, making the problem of whose taxes to
increase increasingly sticky.
   The budget summit talks, if they succeed, are likely to
provide only general outlines of a tax bill, leaving details
to the House and Senate tax-writing committees. And when
faced with the pointed debate over whose taxes to raise, they
are likely to cast a broad net, spreading the pain over as
many groups as possible.
   "If the assumption is a $25 billion tax increase for
fiscal 1991, in my judgment it has got to be a very
broad-based package," said big-business lobbyist Charls
Walker. "It has to be a package of pain that strikes out in
as many directions and touches as many people and groups as
possible."
   Thus, even new federal targets such as advertising may
reach the hit list in Washington. Some government tax
officials are contemplating a plan that would cut the tax
deduction for advertising expenses to 80% from the current
100%.
   Insurance companies may also take a hit. Stock-owned
insurance companies and mutually owned insurance companies
have been feuding for decades over each other's tax
treatment. "They're like children," says Rep. Fortney Stark,
a California Democrat. The result this year may be that both
see their tax burden rise.
   The two insurance groups have been preparing for that
possibility for months, each hiring scores of lobbyists to
push its cause on Capitol Hill and contributing huge amounts
of money to the tax-writers' campaign coffers. Six mutual
life insurance companies even contributed $100,000 last month
to a charity function organized by Chris Downey, the wife of
Rep. Downey, the mutuals' top supporter on the Ways and Means
Committee. "It's a coincidence," says Anne Fleming, who
helped organize the fund-raiser, of the insurance companies'
support.
   Other possibilities include using the tax code to crack
down on a range of perceived environmental evils, including
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide emissions,
polystyrene packaging, and lumber cut from old redwoods. A
related possibility involves limiting the deduction for
employer-provided parking expenses, a move that would
discourage commuting by car.
   Other tax-raising options aimed at hitting corporations or
high-income taxpayers that are likely to be considered by
Congress include:
   -- Taxing Social Security benefits received by high-income
taxpayers.
   -- Taxing gains on short-term securities trades more
stiffly.
   -- Restricting a real-estate tax break permitting tax-free
swaps of property.
   -- Stepping up efforts to collect taxes from U.S.
subsidiaries of foreign corporations.
   All these options may seem like a long laundry list, but
the tab is also big. A $25 billion tax increase would be the
biggest one-year tax increase in history. As a grinning Ways
and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski warned recently at a
breakfast meeting in Chicago: "Here comes the tax man."

   Your Money Matters:
   Pitfalls of the Insurance-Policy Shuffle

   Remember that well-intentioned advice about
conscientiously researching the financial strength and other
attributes of insurance companies before you buy policies?
Such efforts may be a waste of time.
   Insurance companies routinely sell blocks of policies to
other companies. And policyholders may not even know that
their policies have been transferred.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consider the predicament of Joseph and Margaret Barsocchi.
In 1982, they purchased three single-premium deferred
annuities for a total of nearly $7,500 from First Pyramid
Life Insurance, based in their home town of Little Rock, Ark.
Six years later their annuities had been transferred in
succession to three other insurers. The last one, Diamond
Benefit Life Insurance Co., was declared insolvent in late
1988, and the Barsocchis haven't been paid any interest on
their annuities since December 1988.
   Diamond Benefit's court-appointed receiver and various
lawyers are trying to determine which of the three insurers
that held the annuities is responsible to the Arkansas couple
and some 1,400 other people who bought First Pyramid
annuities.
   Policy transfers are "a fact of life" in the insurance
business, said an actuary at one company. While some major
insurers such as Prudential Insurance Co. of America and
Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. say they don't sell
blocks of policies, several thousand policies are transferred
by other firms annually. Life, health and investment-type
policies, such as annuities, are the types most often
transferred because they are longer-term and often can't be
canceled by the insurers.
   An official at the American Council of Life Insurers
estimates that the number of transfers has been increasing,
partly because of the consolidation among life and health
insurers in recent years. "That consolidation is expected to
continue, and the way to consolidate is do assumption deals,"
said a council official.
   Through a procedure called assumption reinsurance, the
buyer takes on the entire obligation, and the policies are
transferred to the books of the new company.
   If the assuming company becomes insolvent, the original
company usually claims it's no longer liable to
policyholders. Holders may have little recourse unless
they're covered by a state guaranty fund and the acquiring
company is licensed in the state where they live. Even then,
holders might not recover a dime for years while the firms
squabble over which one is responsible to the policyholders.
   Policy transfers by insurers aren't rigidly regulated. In
most states, current regulation "doesn't offer any protection
for policyholders," said Joseph Belth, a professor of
insurance at Indiana University. Though transfers generally
are done without policyholders' consent, "Any time a policy
is transferred, it poses potential problems for consumers,"
he said.
   Few states review all these deals. For instance,
California requires approval only when 50% or more of all
policies a company has written, its "book of business," is
being transferred. Other states, such as Pennsylvania and
Arizona, require regulator approval when substantially all of
a company's business is being transferred.
   "In general, life insurers do what they want to do, and
regulators try to keep up," said James L. Hunt, a director of
the National Insurance Consumer Organization, based in
Arlington, Va.
   Regulators defend the practice, noting that policies are
often transferred from weaker to stronger insurers. Sometimes
regulators even arrange transfers.
   But not always. The Barsocchis' experience shows how messy
such transfers can get. Regulators in California recall that
First Pyramid, the company from which the Barsocchis bought
their annuities, ran into financial trouble in late 1983.
(First Pyramid was licensed in California.) Security Benefit
Life Insurance Co. of Topeka, Kan., a top-rated company,
acquired First Pyramid in 1984 and assumed all of its
business in 1986. It issued a certificate of assumption and
notified First Pyramid policyholders that it was responsible
for these policies. This was the only transfer the Barsocchis
knew about.
   A year later, Security Benefit transferred the
single-premium annuities to Life Assurance Co. of
Pennsylvania, based in Pittsburgh. Life Assurance sold the
annuities to Diamond Benefit in 1988.
   Diamond Benefit's receiver claims the assumption
reinsurance agreement with Life Assurance isn't valid, so
Life Assurance is still responsible for these annuities. But
holders may not have a much better chance of recovering their
money from Life Assurance. In April, California regulators
ordered Life Assurance to cease its operations because they
found the company technically insolvent.
   Pennsylvania regulators say they still consider Life
Assurance solvent, though they have monitored it closely for
two years, aware that, among other things, it has reinsurance
pacts with companies that are in financial trouble.
   The Barsocchis are part of a class-action suit in Arkansas
state court against Security Benefit that seeks to recover
some $25 million in funds originally deposited with First
Pyramid. Security Benefit contends that it isn't liable
because it transferred the policies to Life Assurance.
   James Foster, president of Life Assurance, said, "The
transfer of risk has occurred, and Diamond Benefit has the
liability."
   The suit against Security Benefit is based on the
contract-law principle of novation: Duties and obligations of
a contract can't be transferred without the consent of both
parties. The suit contends that because the policyholders
never approved the transfer of their annuities to Life
Assurance, Security Benefit is responsible for these
contracts. Several state courts have upheld the novation
concept.
   Some insurance companies and regulators contend
policyholder approval isn't needed. When Lone Star Life
Insurance Co. acquired a block of disability income policies
from Ohio State Life Insurance Co. last year, it told
policyholders that paying premiums to Lone Star or cashing
benefit checks would be considered evidence that they had
accepted Lone Star as their new insurer and agreed to the
transfer of their policies. The letter from Lone Star didn't
mention that it had a single-C-plus rating from A.M. Best
Co., compared with Ohio State's single-A-plus rating. (Lone
Star's rating was recently upgraded to single-B-minus.)
   But with state regulation all over the lot, people have
little assured recourse other than going to court. New York
won't approve transfers without the policyholders' consent or
if the company that wants to assume a block of business isn't
licensed in the state.
   Some other states require approval by state regulators of
a certificate of assumption, or letter, which notifies
policyholders that their policies have been transferred to
another insurer. Illinois requires the certificate of
approval to include some means for policyholders to indicate
acceptance or rejection of a new insurer. New Hampshire
stipulates that policyholders who don't accept the new
insurer must be allowed by the old company to cancel their
policies without any surrender charges.
   Indiana University's Prof. Belth said being allowed to
cancel a policy without penalties "is simply not enough." If
the canceled policy provides accident or medical expense
coverage, the holder might have developed an illness or
condition that disqualifies him for a new policy with another
company, leaving him uninsured.
   Mr. Belth said a policyholder's greatest protection is the
right to refuse to accept a new carrier. "It means the
consumer must be on guard and ready to refuse to be
transferred, even though the letter from the {assuming}
company makes it sound like a fait accompli."
   Earlier this month, the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners set up a task force to study the extent of
current state regulation of these transfers and to develop a
standardized set of regulations for states to consider
adopting.

   Expects Flat Earnings

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
</IN>
<LP>
   KALAMAZOO, Mich. -- First of America Bank Corp. expects to
report net income of $31.3 million to $32.3 million, or $1.50
to $1.55 a fully diluted share, for the second quarter,
Chairman Daniel R. Smith said.
   The regional bank holding company earned $32.3 million, or
$1.54 a fully diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Smith said the company foresees good earnings growth
for the rest of the year, reflecting a seasonal rise in loan
and deposit demand. Still, Mr. Smith said he doesn't expect
loans and deposits to increase beyond earlier 6% growth
projections for the year. As a result, First of America
officials said they expect net for 1990 to fall within the
low end of analysts' estimates of $6.65 to $6.95 a share.
   First of America's return on assets for the first six
months is expected to be 1.02% to 1.04%, compared with 1% for
all of 1989. Return on common equity will likely decline to
14.9% to 15.42% for the second quarter from 15.46% a year
earlier.
   The bank has no foreign loans left on its books and hasn't
participated in buy-out financing. As of Saturday, First of
America expects to have reserves equaling 139% of
non-performing loans, up from 135% a year earlier.
   On May 4, First of America completed the repurchase of one
million shares of common stock, or 5.7% of its shares
outstanding. That action had the effect of raising
second-quarter 1990 earnings by two cents a share.
   In light of the expected pickup in business in the final
six months, and because major loan write-downs are unlikely,
a dividend increase in the second half "will be given strong
consideration," said Thomas W. Lambert, First of America's
executive vice president and chief financial officer.
   First of America has raised its dividend by five cents a
share in the latter half of each of the past four years. The
company currently pays a 55-cent-a-share regular quarterly
dividend.

   Low Costs, Ticket Prices Seen
   As Method to Encourage
   Productions on Broadway

   NEW YORK -- A theater industry group, concerned about the
decline in non-musical plays on Broadway, announced a plan to
encourage production by cutting costs and ticket prices.
   The plan, called the Broadway Alliance, would enable
so-called straight plays to be produced in three underused
Broadway theaters for $400,000 each, half the usual minimum
cost. Similarly, ticket prices, which average about $36 for
Broadway plays and musicals, would be cut to a maximum $24
for orchestra seats, and a minimum $10 for balcony seats.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The cuts in production and ticket costs would be possible
because of concessions in salary, royalty and manpower and
other costs negotiated with a variety of unions and theater
operators, producers and suppliers. The alliance has
agreements with organizations such as Actors' Equity
Association to reduce the minimum contract salary in its
productions by 25%. The plan allows for profit sharing after
costs have been recouped.
   The plan envisions the production of one-set plays with
small casts to limit operating costs.
   In addition, the three designated theaters in which the
productions will be mounted won't charge rent until
production costs have been recouped. The three theaters are
the Nederlander, the Walter Kerr and either the Belasco or
the Lyceum.
   The alliance grew out of concern among producers and
actors that straight plays were being produced in
off-Broadway theaters. At the suggestion of the League of
American Theatres and Producers, a trade group, a task force
was formed in late 1988 to address the problem of dwindling
straight plays on Broadway.
   Dramatic plays increasingly are finding their way into
production in the about 33 off-Broadway theaters, where
ticket prices average about $22. Off-Broadway theaters are
those outside the mid-town Manhattan theater district with
seating under 500. Union pay scales are often tied to size of
the theater, so the cost of producing a play off-Broadway may
range anywhere from less than $200,000 to as much as
$750,000, according to George Elmer, secretary-treasurer of
the League of Off-Broadway Theatres and Producers, and a
theatrical general manager. There are 38 Broadway theaters,
including one at Lincoln Center.
   Although the Broadway Alliance says that it isn't
competing with off-Broadway theater, members of the task
force conceded that the dramatic plays are being produced
elsewhere.
   The project will run from Sept. 1 through February 1992.
The alliance hopes to raise $1 million for a fund to help
producers complete financing of plays.

   Nooz kums to us frum France that the guvermint has decided
to spell French more like itz spoken. Mostlee, the 1,200 odd
changes arent big ones -- they lopped the little hats off the
`i's' and `u's' and they took away some hyphens. All rite.
But how kum? Their reasons are suspishus.
   Prime Minister Michel Rocard sez he wants to make things
eezier for kids facing the demands of their own langwidge.
The guvermint hopes the simplificashun will aid foriners --
that iz, Africans in ex-French koloneez -- in their struggle
with the old imperial tung. Itz trew that French iz
difficult, and that many of the changes -- "piquenique",
French for "picnic," bekumz piquenique -- arent exactly
revolushionerry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Behind the recommendashuns of M. Rocard's High Commishun
on the French Langwidge, though, rests an uncommishun-like
emoshun: panick. 1992 is approaching fast and English is
turning out to be the forin langwidge of choice in
pioneerland East Yurp. The French fear they'll lose what grip
they retain on internashional culture. French, of course,
used to be the world's langwidge, the "lingua franca" of
diplomats. To find vestiges of that grandeur, just look at
the text inside yer passport. What will yew find? French.
   In fact, the noo rerite provides ample evidence of how
much the French have allredy caved. This time, the regime has
confined itself to removing hifins from anglicisms that have
snuk their way into the langwidge of Racine and Proust.
Weekend, for example, bekumz weekend. Just a few years ago,
in the early days of his presidencee, Francois Mitterrand was
ordering kinglier changes. He directed his guvermint to
concoct French alternatives to "Franglais" words. The
walkman, for example, bekame the "baladeur." Parisians,
though, turned their nozes up at this "dirigisme". Even M.
Mitterrand's own guvermint did not get very far with the
Frenchonlee policee. This noozpaper's Thomas Kamm has
reported that when M. Mitterrand's forin minister, Roland
Dumas, met with francophone heads of state to discuss the
future of the problem, he told them it was time to set up un
task force.
   Az for the hifins, mebbe the French arnt doing themselves
a favor. For a year now diplomats at Kay d'Orsay have been
complaining that Germun reunification will let the Germuns
dominate in Yurp. So what are the French doing? Turning nice
palatable wurds like "contre-espionnage" into long
unpalatable wuns like "contreespionnage." Lots of foriners
and Frenchmin too wud call that a Germunification of the
French langwidge.
   The idee that the changes will help foriners iz also
kwestionable. Won of the major shifts is in the spelling of
the French wurd for unyun, "oignon." The French say it wud be
better tew spill unyun like itz spoken, "ognon". But this
will mean a lot of updating works for publishers who produce
cookbooks documenting that very American fenomenon, "nouvelle
cuisine". And if they're going tew change "oignon", why dont
they change that evun harder wurd for its cozzin, garlick --
ail?
   In fact, the "modest" French proposall will even force itz
way into American dictionaries. "Bonhomie", for example, kums
from the French, but is now an English word. Now, in the name
of accomodating foriners, the French want tew switch the
French spelling -- "bonhomie" bekumz "bonhommie". Where doze
that leave us Americans with our spelling? Websturs will
rilly be pleezed.
   Behind the reriting of the French langwidge something for
witch there iz a fine French word: "tiers-mondisme",
Third-Worldism. In the hope of making things eezier for
African Francophones, the French are lowering the levill for
evereewun. We wonder if all the distingwished Francophone
authors from this part of the world will appreshiate being
condescended to.
   The wurld, of course, has survived such efforts before.
Rite here in Amerika, earlier this censhury, Kernel McCormick
changed the spelling of English in his noozpapers. Through
bekame thru and night bekame nite. But in the end mytee
papers like the Chikago Tribyewn changed bak. The only item
frum that vocabulary that can claim to have survived is
perhaps our ubikwitous adjective for diet food: lite.
   Even the French -- espeshully the French -- have their own
failed models to look bak tew. After the revolushun, the
guvermint gave the months noo names, like "Thermidor" and
renumbered the years, bekuz it wunted to shake off the
influence of the old society and the Cathlick church. That
lasted fewer than 15 years. After Napoleon bekame emperur,
they went back to "Janvier" and "Fevrier". Wait that long,
and the Mitterrand changes may have disappeared. Problee, we
shudnt wurry.

   White House, Key Senators Compromise
   On Housing Bill, Boosting Its Prospects

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration and key senators
agreed on a compromise version of a major housing bill,
boosting prospects for Senate approval of the legislation.
   The agreement represents an important bipartisan
breakthrough, culminating three years of work to formulate a
new housing agreement. The National Affordable Housing Act is
expected to be introduced on the Senate floor today by
co-sponsors Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) and Alfonse D'Amato
(R., N.Y.).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Staff members from the Housing and Urban Development
Department, the White House Office of Management and Budget
and the Senate Banking Committee met over the weekend to work
on the agreement. HUD Secretary Jack Kemp met with members of
the committee yesterday morning to iron out the final details
of the compromise.
   The final proposal calls for total outlays of $18.1
billion for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, followed by
increases to $19.5 billion in fiscal 1992 and $21 billion in
fiscal 1993. The administration originally had asked for
total outlays considerably lower than those in the
compromise, but agreed to the higher levels in return for
concessions on other major points.
   One of those compromises was an agreement to increase
funding for the Home Ownership and Opportunity for People
Everywhere program, a key part of Secretary Kemp's program to
provide public-housing residents with money to purchase homes
from public housing authorities. The compromise calls for
$240 million in fiscal 1991, $650 million in fiscal 1992 and
$1 billion the following year. The bill originally had
contained $435 million over the three years.
   The higher levels represent a victory for Mr. Kemp, who
lobbied hard for the HOPE program and considered it essential
to his "urban homesteading" concept of empowering the poor to
purchase their homes, rather than rent.
   Another crucial element of the legislation was the funding
of the Housing Opportunity Program, which would supply money
to cities and states for developing and rehabilitating
affordable housing. The new program, if accepted, would
consolidate 10 existing programs. A proposal offered by Sen.
Connie Mack (R., Fla.) would allow recipients to use HOP
funds for rental assistance through the use of vouchers, a
position that was resisted by some members of the Banking
Committee.
   The administration compromised on the issue of new
construction of public housing units. The administration had
sought to require states and localities to match federal
funds 1-to-1, but agreed to the Senate Democrats' position of
a 2-to-1 match. Secretary Kemp had warned last week that the
bill might be vetoed because of the construction provisions,
saying he feared the possibility of profiteering from new
construction projects.
   The accord also includes provisions to improve the
actuarial soundness of the Federal Housing Administration's
mortgage-insurance program, which is threatened by solvency
problems unless higher premiums are introduced, according to
a report done for the organization by Price Waterhouse.
   The compromise calls for two-thirds of the closing costs
for FHA borrowers to be paid up-front, rather than financed
over the life of the mortgage. Additionally, the compromise
accepted the administration's proposal to add a 0.5% annual
risk-based premium on loans to home-buyers who make low down
payments.
   The HUD secretary will be given discretion to make
adjustments in the premium required of FHA borrowers to
"reflect the condition of the economy," a source close to the
negotiations said.
   Mike Ferrell, lobbyist and general counsel for the
Mortgage Bankers of America, criticized the compromise,
particularly the requirement that first-time home-buyers
provide two-thirds of their closing costs at one time. "The
net effect of this will make the FHA an insurer of last
resort," he said. "The borrowers in good markets will go with
private mortgage companies, leaving the FHA with the
high-risk borrowers." He added that the provision could knock
out 75,000 to 100,000 first-time buyers.
   Others see the compromise as an overdue necessity. Citing
a 1989 General Accounting Office report showing default rates
of as much as 40% for low down-payment loans made in the
early 1980s, Tom Schraw of National People's Action, a
consumer advocacy group, supported the administration's
position. "If one out of three people with low down-payment
loans defaults," he said, "we don't think anyone, liberal or
conservative, can support that kind of program."

   WASHINGTON -- The House Appropriations Committee approved
an $83.6 billion fiscal 1991 spending bill that would
increase federal low-income housing aid by $3.8 billion and
cut virtually all funding for President Bush's initiative to
explore the moon and Mars.
   Spending for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration would grow by 17% from the current fiscal year
to nearly $14.3 billion, but the cut from the Mars project is
nonetheless a defeat for the administration. The White House
will try to restore funding in the Senate, but as
deficit-reduction talks proceed, the demand for new spending
cuts will only heighten competition with such other NASA
priorities as the continuing space station and shuttle
programs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yesterday's committee action came as the full House
adopted a nearly $10.6 billion bill funding portions of the
State, Justice, and Commerce Departments and incorporating
increased appropriations to expedite the government's
prosecution of savings-and-loan fraud cases. Final approval
came on a 368-55 roll call, after back-to-back votes in which
the Appropriations Committee leadership beat back amendments
to impose 5% and 2% across-the-board cuts.
   However important politically, the $75 million for S&amp;L
cases is a relatively small part of the overall spending
bill, which includes major increases in U.S. contributions to
the United Nations and affiliated health and nutrition
organizations. Though less than requested by the president,
appropriations to these accounts would grow by 28% to $787.6
million in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, with $115
million allocated to peace-keeping operations, a 41% increase
from fiscal 1990.
   Second only to the annual Pentagon bill in total
discretionary spending, the $83.6 billion measure reported
from the Appropriations Committee represents an amalgam of
interests running from old cities to the newest initiatives
of science. Apart from the major housing and space accounts,
more than $6 billion is provided for the Environmental
Protection Agency, and appropriations for the Veterans
Affairs Department would grow to nearly $31.3 billion, or the
equivalent of the entire transportation appropriations bill
for the coming fiscal year.
   Increased medical and benefit costs reflect an aging
veterans population nationwide, but the totals also include
parochial construction projects that run from hospital beds
to parking spaces and new cemeteries. An estimated $18
million is allocated for an Ann Arbor medical center in the
home state of Michigan Rep. Bob Traxler, chairman of the
subcommittee that drafted the bill, for example, and a $6
million amendment attached yesterday contains language
earmarking the treatment funds for hospitals in Michigan,
Massachusetts and New Jersey.
   The increased funding for housing reflects a major
initiative set by the House-passed budget resolution this
spring, and the money is calculated to support more than
118,000 subsidized units, or 60% above the current level.
Within these totals, an estimated $2.7 billion is provided to
improve existing public housing for the poorest tenants, an
increase of more than 25% from current funding and about $900
million more than the president requested.
   The large spending increases will be challenged under any
deficit-reduction compromise with the administration, but the
Appropriations Committee leadership has quietly used the
process to stake out priorities for the Democratic-controlled
chamber. Though their bills have yet to be released publicly,
subcommittees covering transportation, health, and education
accounts have funded initiatives of their own. As lawmakers
commit themselves to the new figures, it could be more
difficult to impose subsequent cuts.
   For example, Rep. William Natcher (D., Ky.), whose
jurisdiction includes the Departments of Education and Health
and Human Services, is proposing to increase compensatory
education funding for young, low-income children in public
schools to $6.2 billion, reflecting a nearly $1 billion
increase in aid to local districts. A comparable increase is
assumed for the National Institutes of Health, where an
estimated $8.6 billion would be provided in direct or reserve
funds.
   Within transportation accounts, an estimated $30.78
billion bill reported recently from subcommittee would
substantially increase funding for airport grants to $1.8
billion after Oct. 1, while highway trust fund obligations
would grow more than 25% to $14.5 billion.
   Amtrak is tentatively slated to receive about $632
million, and while less than the administration's request, an
estimated $2.1 billion is provided for facilities and
equipment accounts for the Federal Aviation Administration,
nearly 25% above current levels.
   Amid this largess, the appropriations leadership has found
money to benefit -- and woo -- some of its historic
tormentors. With much sarcasm, the full committee yesterday
approved a $479,000 community-development provision sought by
Deputy GOP Whip Robert Walker for his home district in
Pennsylvania.
   The transportation subcommittee similarly found $2 million
for a southwest Minnesota highway project requested by Rep.
Bill Frenzel, the ranking Republican on the House Budget
Committee, and among those signing letters supporting a
monorail system in Orange County, Calif., was Rep. William
Dannemeyer (R., Calif.), who has been regularly proposing 5%
across-the-board cuts.
   This generosity contrasts with the discipline exacted
against one of the Democrats' own, Colorado Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, who voted against the committee leadership this
spring in a fight over House mailing costs. At a subsequent
House whips meeting, Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.) criticized
those who defected, and parochial requests by Rep. Schroeder
were stripped from the transportation bill.

   1990 Pretax Profit
   Of $298.3 Million

   LONDON -- Maxwell Communication Corp. reported pretax
profit of #172.3 million ($298.3 million) for the year ended
March 31, below London analysts' expectations.
   The British publishing concern didn't provide directly
comparable figures for the year-earlier period, citing a
change in the company's accounting year and a radical
restructuring of its business. Once largely a printing
concern, Maxwell became a major publishing company with its
recent purchases of Macmillan Inc. and Dun &amp; Bradstreet
Corp.'s Official Airline Guides unit in the U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Maxwell said its fiscal 1990 pretax profit was 10% below
the #192 million posted in the 15 months ended March 31,
1989. It added that the fiscal 1990 result was 12% above
#153.6 million, which represents 12/15ths, or an "annualized"
portion, of the #192 million figure. The company last year
moved to a March 31 fiscal year from a calendar reporting
year.
   But at a time when Maxwell says it is eager to boost
investors' awareness of the company, particularly in the
U.S., officials wouldn't provide results for the 12 months
ended March 31, 1989. "There would really be no purpose or
benefit" in doing so, Katherine Pelly, corporate analyst at
Maxwell, said at a news conference.
   Analysts declined to estimate those results, saying the
changes in the accounting year and the company's shift into
publishing made such comparisons difficult. "The whole
company's changed so much that not only are you comparing
apples with oranges in terms of time period, but also very
much with the substance" of the business, said Hank Powell,
an analyst at Nomura Research Institute in London.
   But with the fiscal 1990 results falling below analysts'
forecasts, London markets reacted somewhat gloomily to the
news. Maxwell shares fell four pence to 195 pence ($3.38) on
London's Stock Exchange yesterday.
   Analysts voiced particular concern about interest charges
Maxwell has incurred as a result of heavy borrowing to fund
its acquisitions. In fiscal 1990, the company had a net
charge arising from investment income and interest payments
of #108.1 million, compared with #17 million in the 15 months
ended March 31, 1989.
   That charge helped pull profit attributable to
shareholders, or net profit, to #101.1 million in fiscal
1990, compared with #190 million in the earlier 15-month
period. Per-share earnings were 20 pence in fiscal 1990
compared with 24 pence in the earlier period. The company
recommended a final dividend of 8.5 pence a share, boosting
the full-year dividend to 15 pence a share. The dividend in
the previous 15 months was 18 pence a share. Sales totaled
#1.24 billion in fiscal 1990, compared with #1.39 billion in
the previous 15-month period.
   Chairman Robert Maxwell said the company's debt, which
peaked at #2.7 billion last September, has fallen back to
#1.9 billion and "is traveling downward fast." Maxwell hopes
to reduce its debt by selling about $800 million of
"non-strategic businesses" and $150 million of surplus
property. He declined to elaborate.

   Brazil Breaks With Protectionism,
   Announces Plan to Open Imports

   Economy Minister Rethinks
   A Freeze on $1.8 Billion
   In Foreign Firms' Funds

   SAO PAULO, Brazil -- The government declared a "profound
break" with Brazil's protectionist past, announcing a plan to
lower tariffs, ease import restrictions and cut subsidies for
inefficient industries. It also hinted it might unfreeze $1.8
billion in foreign funds deposited at the central bank.
   Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello said tariffs would
be reduced immediately on imported fibers, cloth and
clothing, and on machines and machine parts that don't
compete with machines manufactured in Brazil. She said import
quotas would be abolished as of Sunday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   She also said the government would set up a procedure to
cut the highest tariffs almost two-thirds by 1994, to 40%
from 105% today, and would create a privately controlled
foreign trade bank. And she pledged government help to
improve education and technological development.
   "This represents a profound break with the past," Miss
Cardoso de Mello said on nationwide television.
   Analysts said the economic plan, if implemented, could
revitalize Brazil's long-protected economy. But they
cautioned that results could be long in coming. Some
initiatives are unlikely to be sent to Congress before next
year, and it will have the power to approve or reject them.
   The minister said, however, that several short-term
measures would be announced in detail today, including an
unspecified "change" in a regulation that last month froze
about $1.8 billion in profits that multinationals had
deposited at the central bank. Although the freeze was
supposed to last 18 months, Miss Cardoso de Mello said an
improvement in Brazil's foreign-exchange reserves has allowed
her to modify the rule.
   Many multinational executives thought that last month's
blockage made a mockery of Brazil's declarations that it
welcomed greater foreign investment and competition. Lifting
it would send a clear signal to outside investors that the
government is serious about opening the economy.
   In her announcement and in television interviews that
followed, the economy minister also said the government would
review protectionist laws that shield the nation's computer
industry from foreign competition, regulate software imports,
and set intellectual-property policies. It will also consider
ways to strengthen antitrust laws. Many of these laws have
raised the ire of the U.S. government and Congress. The
minister said the tariff reductions for clothing and fibers
would help damp inflation.
   Most Brazilian economists believe Brazil must throw off
four decades of protectionist shackles and liberalize its
economy if it is to compete with the world. But analysts and
business leaders were ambivalent about the government's plan.
   "I would like the government to free raw materials
imports, but I wouldn't be too happy about {lower tariffs on}
clothing imports," said Olga de Almeida Prado, an owner of
Tweed, a top men's clothing maker.
   Yoshiaki Nakano, an economist specializing in foreign
trade, said the 1994 tariff goal doesn't go far enough. "I
think {the maximum} should be smaller, from 15% to 20%,
because four or five years is enough time for industry to
adapt," he said. At the same time, Mr. Nakano voiced many
businessmen's fears that the exposure to lower foreign prices
could "turn Brazilian industry into scrap metal."
   Asked just how far the government plans to go in exposing
the computer industry to foreign competition, Miss Cardoso de
Mello noted that the new policy must still be discussed with
the Brazilian Congress. "Foreign capital should have more
effective participation in the new design," she said. But,
she said, "this should be consistent with the need we have to
develop our own technolgy."
   She added: "In sectors where Brazil can produce and master
technology, it will. In sectors where an association {with a
foreign partner} is better, this will be the route. And in
sectors where Brazil is unable to compete and create an
industry, and foreign capital should participate, it will be
asked to do so."
   The proposals follow visits in the past month by U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills and Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher.

   NEW YORK -- Bond and stock prices shot up as President
Bush talked tough about the budget deficit, then drifted
lower for the rest of the day. Bonds ended with gains, but
stocks closed a bit lower, and the dollar fell.
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose one-half point,
or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Trading was brisk in the
morning but waned as the day wore on. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average eased 2.72 points to close at 2842.33 in
light trading. The dollar dropped against the mark and the
yen. Currency traders said Mr. Bush's remarks had negative
implications for the dollar.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bush sparked the opening surge in bond prices with
comments about steps the administration sees as necessary to
deal with the deficit, including possible tax increases. That
was good news for bond investors because a successful
deficit-reduction package could cut the government's
borrowing needs, thereby easing some of the upward pressure
on interest rates.
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has
indicated a willingness to ease interest rates if Congress
and the administration can act swiftly to cut the deficit.
   Bond traders said most of the action came from dealers who
had sold borrowed bonds, betting on further price declines,
then rushed to buy them back after Mr. Bush's comments.
Prices began drifting lower as traders pondered, with some
confusion, what kind of taxes the Bush administration is
willing to raise.
   Stock prices exploded at the opening bell, and the Dow
Jones industrials were up as much as 30 points by 10:15 a.m.
Ben Capaldi, a partner at Brandywine Asset Management,
Wilmington, Del., said that while Mr. Bush's remarks "got
people excited earlier in the day," the euphoria cooled as
investors realized no details were mentioned and that
politicians could still flub the opportunity to cut the
deficit.
   The dollar fell because traders think higher taxes would
weaken the U.S. economy and cause the Fed to ease interest
rates. Such a step would make the dollar less attractive than
some other major currencies.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices edged lower on volume of 141.4 million shares
in New York Stock Exchange trading. Declining issues
outnumbered advancers 752-706.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.51%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6630 marks and 154.67 yen, compared with
1.6770 marks and 155.35 yen late Monday.

   Palermitan Pushers: The Heroin Mainline

   Just how Sicilian dons came to control the U.S. heroin
traffic is the subject of Claire Sterling's "Octopus: The
Long Reach of the International Sicilian Mafia" (Norton, 384
pages, $19.95). Carefully researched, vividly written,
"Octopus" goes a long way to untangle a subject that is among
the most difficult to investigate and understand.
   A longtime resident of Italy, Ms. Sterling has written
extensively on terrorism's global reach, most recently in
"The Time of the Assassins," which linked the near murder of
Pope John Paul II to the Bulgarians and the KGB. In
"Octopus," she shows how the Sicilian Mafia (and not its
American offspring as conventionally believed) played a key
role in setting up the heroin pipeline to the U.S. and the
distribution network here.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As far back as 1957, the American dons "leased" domestic
narcotics distribution to their Sicilian godfathers. With a
firm monopoly on marketing, the Sicilians made deals with
Turkish gangs that managed the pipeline bringing heroin from
Pakistan to the eastern Mediterranean. But in the early
1970s, the French authorities shut down the "French
Connection" laboratories, thereby eliminating the Sicilians'
main competitors. From then on, Palermo was the sole
headquarters for the assault on the U.S.
   Much of the story is told through fascinating and often
frightening portraits of drug lords, among them Michele
Sindona, favorite banker to the Mafia until he lost billions
for the dons in his bank scams; and Luciano Leggio -- the
"capo di tutti i capi." Locked up for life in 1974 on a
murder conviction, Leggio continued to conduct much of his
business from his Italian jail cell, establishing near total
control of the Sicilian Mafia's activities, including the
drug trade. Leggio's centralized authority, coupled with
control of the raw heroin supply and laboratories, resulted
in an enormous infusion of heroin into the U.S. by the end of
1977. The population of heroin addicts rose to about 750,000
-- nearly 20 times the number in 1963 when the Sicilian Mafia
began its serious assault.
   Ms. Sterling has no patience with any liberal notions that
drug dealers are only catering to some inherent weakness of
our already corrupt society. "Octopus" documents the
extensive efforts by the Sicilians to stimulate demand and
expand their drug markets.
   In this effort they were aided by some of the losers in
the Mafia wars in Sicily who emigrated to Canada, Brazil,
Venezuela and the U.S., where they became franchisees for the
home company. Ms. Sterling points out that in 1972, when the
entire U.S. heroin population consumed some 90 kilos (198
pounds) a month, the Brazilian Mafia families alone were
preparing to ship 300 kilos a month. The Mafia was not just
feeding a habit, but creating one.
   But "Octopus" also describes the incredible battle put up
by the Italian police and members of the judiciary, who
challenged the Sicilian Mafia on its own turf. Many were
blown up or shot to death, including the prefect of Palermo,
gunned down with his young wife by Kalashnikovwielding thugs.
Others survived to see hundreds of Mafiosi they had put
behind bars in the 1980s slip back into business through
grotesque loopholes. Beginning in 1986, an Italian high court
packed with judicial theorists systematically threw out lower
court verdicts on procedural grounds that ranged from
"defects of motivation" to "errors of form."
   If there is a weakness in "Octopus," it concerns the
cocaine trade, where convincing documentation is still
lacking. But given what Ms. Sterling has learned about the
Sicilian Mafia, it is reasonable to suppose -- as she does --
that the untouched and uncontrolled Mafia families in
Venezuela have established close business ties with the
Medellin gangsters next door in Colombia, just as the
Sicilian Mafia dominated the Turkish, Corsican and Camorra
gangs in earlier periods. Whoever controls the distribution
network eventually controls the supply as well.
   There are some valuable lessons in "Octopus." Foremost is
that no anti-drug program can succeed without a close working
relationship between law enforcement and judicial agencies,
both nationally and internationally. When such cooperation
exists, great achievements are possible; without it, each
country and each branch of government flounders in its own
confusion. Typical was the "Pizza Connection" court case that
partially uncovered the Sicilian Mafia's delivery and
distribution system for heroin in the U.S. Unfortunately,
because of the deplorable lack of cooperation between the
DEA, FBI and various local and state enforcement agencies,
only one segment of the system was exposed, leaving the
pipeline intact.
   That information must be shared was learned -- after years
of failure -- by those fighting terrorism in the mid-1980s,
thanks in part to the work of a presidential task force
headed by then-Vice President George Bush. It is mystifying
that this basic insight has not been driven home to our
anti-narcotics leaders. Perhaps this excellent book will help
remind them of this fundamental principle of effective
action.

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Short interest among larger over-the-counter
stocks rose for the first time since March, posting a 4.5%
increase in the month ended June 15.
   Short interest among smaller OTC stocks rebounded 21.2%,
reclaiming much of a 25.9% drop in May.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   International Lease Finance Corp., which on Monday said it
agreed to be acquired by American International Group Inc.
for $1.3 billion in stock and cash, was among the stocks with
the largest short positions, with nearly 2.4 million shares
sold short, up from 2.1 million a month earlier.
   First Executive Corp., a Los Angeles life insurance
company that once held a large portfolio of junk bonds,
retained its lead with a short position of 9.4 million
shares, 967,000 fewer than in mid-May.
   The short interest in Intel Corp. surged 62.1% to 4.3
million shares, catapulting the Santa Clara, Calif.,
semiconductor concern into second place among the companies
with the largest short positions. One OTC trader suggested
the increase may reflect an arbitrage opportunity. In early
June, Intel said it was accelerating the expiration of its
1992 warrants to expire on July 25. Each warrant entitles the
holder to purchase 1.5 Intel common shares at $45 for each
warrant exercised.
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at lower prices for return to the lender.
   Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.
   And some short interest doesn't reflect any opinion on the
stock at all but shows up as part of another strategy, such
as arbitrage or dividend capture.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, the
self-regulatory agency that operates the Nasdaq computerized
system on which more than 4,300 OTC issues trade, compiles
short interest data in two categories: the approximately
two-thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks that trade
on the National Market System; and the other, generally
smaller stocks that don't.
   NASD reported that short interest in 2,349 National Market
System issues, the largest OTC stocks, rose to 258.4 million
shares at mid-June from 247.2 million in mid-May among 2,327
issues.
   Short interest in 1,263 smaller securities traded on
Nasdaq jumped to 37.5 million shares for June from 30.9
million in May among 1,265 issues.
   The National Market System's short-interest ratio at
mid-June fell to 2.20 from 2.57 a month earlier, while the
short-interest ratio for other OTC issues eased to 0.83 from
0.87 a month earlier.
   The ratio -- the number of trading days at the market's
average daily trading volume that would be required to
convert the total short interest position -- is a measure of
negative trader sentiment. Some analysts suggest, however,
that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because
options and other products can be used to hedge short

   Single, 10-Letter Word Pressured All
   To Set Trump's Bailout: Bankruptcy

   Why would bankers shell out $20 million more in loans to a
man who already owes $3.3 billion and appears to have little
prospect of meeting all of his debt payments on his own? Fear
of bankruptcy court appears to be the best answer.
   On paper, developer Donald Trump could be a perfect
candidate to seek formal protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. He owes money to a
dizzying array of suppliers, banks and bondholders, and
hasn't any prospect of paying them off in full this year.
Restive bondholders and casino suppliers have filed lawsuits
and more are expected. If one bank should move to foreclose
on Mr. Trump, others could follow in rapid succession.
Bankruptcy court could provide an orderly way to keep
creditors at bay while Mr. Trump attempted to put his
financial affairs in order.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the bankers who have clamored to loan him money in the
past don't want any part of such a reorganization. They say
such a court-supervised reorganization would cost them a
fortune in legal fees, take years to complete, reduce their
control over Mr. Trump's assets and personal spending, and
create the risk that a bankruptcy would devalue the Trump
name and depress the market price of his properties.
   To avoid these perceived perils, the bankers have forged
an agreement that creates, in effect, an out-of-court
bankruptcy. It carries many of the same restrictions on Mr.
Trump's activities but without yielding to the mandates of a
bankruptcy judge and without conforming to any formal rules
of court.
   "This country is totally pro-debtor," said one banker who
participated in negotiations. "So it's better for us to give
him a little more money now with the chance of getting a lot
more back later."
   The prospect of a bankruptcy filing permeated all of the
discussions, serving as a tool that banks used against other
banks to secure commitments to the deal and as a weapon that
Mr. Trump occasionally brandished against his creditors. But,
despite such threats, it appears that Mr. Trump had no taste
either for a bankruptcy-court filing, which could lead him to
the brink of financial ruin as each creditor got a shot at
his business and personal holdings.
   Had Mr. Trump filed for bankruptcy-court protection he
would have benefited immediately from the law's most generous
provision: an automatic stay barring any legal maneuvering by
his creditors, including any loan foreclosures.
   Mr. Trump also would have had the exclusive right to file
a plan for reorganization during the first 120 days. That
means he, and not his creditors, could propose to the court
just how he intended to get out of his financial mess. And,
barring any evidence of fraud or serious misconduct, he could
have continued to manage his properties, albeit under the
watchful eyes of a bankruptcy judge.
   Bankruptcy is "a potent lever because it slows things
down," says Alan Kornberg, a bankruptcy partner at Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, in New York. "He remains
in control and his creditors are precluded from taking any
action against him."
   Banks, even more than other creditors, suffer in
bankruptcy court because they lose access to their most
powerful weapon -- foreclosure. "The banks come to the table
without the threat of foreclosure. They can't garnish his
bank accounts, sue, threaten to sue or demand additional
collateral," says former bankruptcy judge Dean M. Gandy, now
a partner at Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld, in Dallas.
"Their position is frozen."
   Avoiding that prospect alone was a powerful incentive for
Mr. Trump's banks to keep negotiating. Under terms of the
proposed $65 million loan agreement -- which still awaits
approval -- the banks will maintain stringent controls over
Mr. Trump's access to cash. He will have to hold down his
monthly spending and adhere to a business plan with strict
month-by-month cash-flow projections.
   Even in bankruptcy court, Mr. Trump would have had to
adhere to a business plan. But a judge -- not Mr. Trump's
creditors -- would have had final say over Mr. Trump's access
to fresh loans. And generally a debtor can get a judge's
approval for such finances if he can show the money is needed
for "good business purposes" and isn't available elsewhere on
better terms.
   Mr. Trump's creditors had other reasons to fear the
Bankruptcy Code. Some of the law's more complex provisions
can bind creditors to a reorganization plan that they don't
like and require them to accept forms of payment they would
otherwise reject.
   Under the law, creditors are separated into classes
depending on the degree to which their loans were secured.
For a final reorganization plan to win court approval, each
class of creditors must consent by vote of two-thirds,
representing two-thirds of the debt owed in each class.
Creditors who fall in the minority -- "non-consenting
creditors" -- can thus be dragged into a financial
reorganization plan that they wouldn't otherwise accept.
   Another provision in the law permits the judge to require
a creditor to accept payment of "money's worth," such as a
note from a debtor, in lieu of cash from the sale of an
asset. This provision, and the judge's authority to enforce
it, is known as a "cram down," and, to creditors, it is one
of the most loathsome aspects of the Bankruptcy Code.
   "A judge," says Mr. Gandy, in Dallas, "might assign
greater value to the future stream of payment than the
creditor would."
   In Mr. Trump's case, the threat of bankruptcy carried
added risks for his creditors. If he had defaulted on loan
payments, Mr. Trump could have had his casino licenses
revoked by the New Jersey Casino Commission. In such an
instance, a receiver could have been appointed to run the
casinos and the value of these properties probably would have
declined, leaving less money to pay off creditors.
   Indeed, any time there is a bankruptcy, the value of the
debtor's assets drops. In Mr. Trump's case, the most
important question to his creditors was whether his
properties would hold their value best inside or outside of
bankruptcy court.
   But for all the negotiating leverage and protection that
Chapter 11 offered Mr. Trump, bankruptcy carried heavy and
unattractive risks as well. In addition to being potentially
humiliating, filing for reorganization would have required
him to hand over ultimate control of his assets to a
bankruptcy judge.
   And because Mr. Trump personally guaranteed over $500
million in loans, he would not likely have been able to file
for corporate bankruptcy alone. He would have been forced to
file personally as well, no small matter for a man as
ego-driven as Mr. Trump. Such a filing would have restricted
virtually every penny Mr. Trump spends on his personal
affairs and limited his control over his empire.
   "You can't just pick up the phone and deal anymore," says
Mr. Gandy. "It's a totally different way of doing business
that would crimp the style of someone like Mr. Trump."

   Citicorp Visa
   Is Taking Aim
   At AT&amp;T Card

   NEW YORK -- Citicorp took another swipe at American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s popular new Universal credit
card.
   Citicorp said it is offering its Visa cardholders the
ability to charge long-distance telephone calls at rates as
much as 22% lower than AT&amp;T's standard calling-card rates.
The long-distance discount, which has been offered by smaller
banks for almost a year, will be provided by MCI
Communications Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The banking giant is following in the footsteps of AT&amp;T
itself, whose own 10% discount off its standard rates is one
of the features that has helped it open more than a million
new Universal Visa and MasterCard charge accounts in the
three months that the card has been available.
   A spokesman for AT&amp;T yesterday questioned Citicorp's claim
of big savings on long-distance calls. "Rates are usually
very competitive between us, MCI and Sprint. The consumer has
to look at that as saying up to 22%," he said.
   There's plenty at stake for Citicorp in this latest
challenge to its dominance in the credit-card business. Last
year, Citicorp's credit-card subsidiary generated more than
$600 million in profit. With more than 37 million cards
outstanding around the world, the company isn't taking kindly
to AT&amp;T's efforts to muscle into the credit-card business.
   This isn't the first effort by Citicorp to stymie the AT&amp;T
card. A month ago, Citicorp and three other big banks with
substantial credit-card businesses -- Chase Manhattan Corp.,
BankAmerica Corp. and MNC Financial Corp. -- asked the
Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Communications Commission
and the Georgia State Banking Department to determine whether
the AT&amp;T card business violates banking and communications
laws. In April, Citicorp transferred $30 million of its
telecommunications business from AT&amp;T to MCI.
   Citicorp claims that it's been considering offering
cardholders long-distance phone service for some time. "The
idea has always been there," said a Citicorp spokesman. "Was
the AT&amp;T offering one part of the decision? Sure. But we
don't react to competition. We react to what our customers
tell us they want."
   Richard Srednicki, business manager for Citibank Visa and
MasterCard, said the bank has only tested the idea of phone
service with cardholders in the last few weeks, but that it
has received a "tremendously positive response." He added
that while it's difficult to tell if Citibank has lost any
cardholders to the new AT&amp;T card, "it's minimal, if any at
all."
   The new phone service is available immediately to Citibank
Visa cardholders and will soon become available to Citibank
MasterCard holders in a few months. The savings estimate is
based on a 10-minute long-distance call during daylight
hours.
   The service that Citibank is offering isn't anything new
to many Visa cardholders at other banks. An MCI spokesman
said the Citibank service is merely a "branded" version of
the Visa Phone service that MCI has made available to some
150 banks since last July.
   While Citicorp may be scrambling to compete with AT&amp;T's
long-distance telephone feature, there's another feature of
the AT&amp;T Universal card that Citicorp hasn't the least
interest in matching: no annual card fee ever for anyone who
signs up this year.
   "We're not planning on cutting fees," said Mr. Srednicki.

   Campeau Unit's
   Creditors May File
   Fraudulence Suit

   TORONTO -- Campeau Corp. said certain creditors of its
Allied Stores Corp. unit have won permission from U.S.
bankruptcy court to file a suit alleging fraudulent
conveyance.
   A fraudulent conveyance suit typically alleges that the
previous owners of a company acquired in a leveraged buy-out
committed fraud by transferring their assets in a sale, even
though the company was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by
the transaction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Campeau said such a suit would be based on Allied's
purchase of shares in Federated Department Stores Inc.,
another Campeau unit, in May 1988 and April 1989. The
purchases gave Allied a 50% stake in Federated.
   Allied and Federated filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in January.
   Campeau said it could be liable to repay as much as $250
million if such a suit were successful. The company didn't
indicate whether it expects a suit to be filed. The
information was contained in a circular distributed by
Campeau ahead of its annual meeting, scheduled for July 30.
   Representatives of the Allied creditors couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Campeau purchased Allied in 1986 and Federated a year
later in highly leveraged transactions with a combined price
tag of $10 billion. Allied used some of the proceeds from the
sale of its Brooks Brothers and Ann Taylor divisions to
purchase the Federated shares from a Campeau subsidiary,
which in turn used the funds to pay off debt from the
Federated acquisition.
   David Heiman, a partner with the law firm of Jones, Day,
Reavis &amp; Pogue of Cleveland, which represents the Ohio-based
Campeau subsidiaries, said the bankruptcy court approved an
agreement between Allied and its bondholders that
"acknowledges we would not claim that they do not have
standing to bring such an action."
   Mr. Heiman said the agreement requires the bondholders to
give 30 days' notice of their intention to file a fraudulent
conveyance suit. He said the parties also agreed not to take
any action at least until Sept. 12, 1990.
   Separately, Campeau disclosed in its information circular
that its chairman and chief executive officer, Robert
Campeau, missed a $1 million payment on a personal loan from
Campeau Corp. that was due April 30.
   The company said it has requested that Mr. Campeau
"propose a plan of repayment" and it "intends to pursue the
remedies available to it if necessary." It said Mr. Campeau
has $13 million in loans outstanding from the company,
including $9 million lent to Mr. Campeau during the fiscal
year ended Jan. 31, 1990.
   Mr. Campeau also faces a deadline of June 30 to come up
with a first payment of 40 million Canadian dollars (US$34
million) to buy back Campeau shares seized from him by
National Bank of Canada after Mr. Campeau defaulted on
personal loans to the bank. Mr. Campeau hasn't indicated how
he intends to raise the money.

   Not so long ago, wearing clothes that looked like flags --
or that were made from flags -- brought forth an immediate
incendiary reaction.
   The National Society Daughters of the American Revolution
forced a stars-and-stripes girdle off the market in 1965,
calling it a "shocking caricature" of the flag. Three years
after that, Mr. Hoffman, the Yippie activist, was arrested
for wearing an American flag shirt. The ensuing flap created
a renegade fashion trend that has now returned in a more
benign, apolitical form, as designers pledge allegiance to
Old Glory's bold graphics. What goes around comes around.
   Why just a few days before the House of Representatives
last week voted down a proposed constitutional amendment
prohibiting the burning and desecration of the flag, Saks
Fifth Avenue, with patriotic zeal and in time for Flag Day
June 14, advertised a flag-patterned shirt: "New Glory. A
salute to casual. . . ." New York shoppers snapped up 50 of
the shirts, at $57.50 each, the first day of the promotion.
The shirt looks a lot like the Hoffman original.
   Mr. Hoffman, after his arrest in 1968, wore the infamous
apparel on "The Merv Griffin Show" and, in so doing, launched
the fashion trend the first time around. TV viewers didn't
actually get to see the shirt because CBS blacked out the
video just as Mr. Hoffman unzipped his jacket to show it off.
The Vietnam War era censorship gave the shirt instant cachet,
and impetus to sales of flag shirts across the land. It also
firmly linked flag fashion with the counterculture. Kids wore
flag patches on the seats of their jeans.
   At least one flag-wearer had his day in court. In 1970, a
Canadian named Valarie Goguen was arrested on Main street in
Leominster, Mass., for wearing jeans that had a small U.S.
flag sewed to the seat. At his arrest, Mr. Goguen insisted
that he hadn't intended to make a political statement. He
claimed that he used a toy flag to patch a hole in his pants.
But a jury convicted him of violating Massachusetts flag laws
and sentenced him to six months in jail.
   Four years later, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned his
conviction, saying the Massachusetts law "fails to draw
reasonably clear lines between the kinds of nonceremonial
treatment that are criminal and those that are not."
   "The flag is a focus in this country for political
expression and social attitudes," says Whitney Smith, a
well-known flag expert, or vexillologist, and director of the
Flag Research Center in Winchester, Mass. "When there is some
national crisis or celebration, people want to express that
sentiment," he says.
   The flag is "unabashedly red, white and blue, fervidly
starred and striped," said designer Donald Brooks during the
first wave of flag fashion.
   Now, more than two decades later, it's the establishment
that plunks down $300 for Ralph Lauren's limited-edition
sweaters with 23-star-flag replicas emblazoned across the
chest. And Perry Ellis sells $2,000 cashmere stoles -- huge
replicas of the flag, but in gray, brown and beige. Marc
Jacobs, who designs for the label, has also used the Old
Glory look on sequined dresses and says he does so with
feelings of reverence. "It's a pride thing for me," he says.
"The American Flag is an icon, and I'm an American designer."
   Today's fashion isn't protesting anything. Designers mean
no disrespect, quite the contrary. And they haven't incurred
the wrath of the current anti-flag-burners even though the
U.S. Flag Code of 1942, as amended, clearly states that the
American flag is not to be used as apparel, bedding or
drapery.
   Congress last year passed the flag protection law that
this spring was overturned by the Supreme Court. It defined
the thing to be protected as "any flag of the United States,
or any part thereof, made of any substance of any size, in a
form that is commonly displayed." The definition didn't
completely eliminate the confusion that exists about when a
piece of fabric is a flag to be protected and when it is a
tank top to be worn to the beach.
   Fashion designers, no constitutional lawyers, clearly
believe that they are within their rights to use flag motifs.
Then, too, there's a general feeling that if you can burn the
flag, you can surely wear one.
   Even supporters of the ill-fated flag amendment aren't
sure where to draw the line. "If someone takes two flags,
sews them together and makes them into a poncho, we have a
problem with that," says John Minnick, a spokesman for the
American Legion.
   But since most flag-fashion isn't made of real flags, Mr.
Minnick doesn't generalize. "I don't know, we'd have to see
the item of clothing first. . . . But if it is done in a
disrespectful manner that holds the American flag up to
ridicule, I can tell you flat out we are opposed to that," he
says.
   The DAR, which still distributes free copies of the flag
code, also isn't doctrinaire about flag fashion. Says the
DAR's president-general, Marie Yokum: "It's a sticky thing
that gets more complicated."

   Dance: Euroschlock Threatens ABT
   ----

   New York -- It's difficult to feel much optimism about the
future of American Ballet Theatre. Unless ABT starts showing
more signs of creative integrity than it has so far under its
new directors, Jane Hermann and Oliver Smith, the company is
hardly likely to survive for very long. Though such an
appraisal may seem premature, the interviews Ms. Hermann and
Mr. Smith have been giving do not inspire confidence in their
artistic judgment.
   What they are planning is to give ABT an infusion of
Euroschlock -- works by those drearily familiar figures, some
of them expatriate Americans, who have made careers out of
portentousness rather than steps: James Kudelka, Maguy Marin,
Glen Tetley and Jiri Kylian. Next season is to bring Mr.
Kylian's meretricious "Sinfonietta," last seen at the Met in
1979 during the visit of Mr. Kylian's own Netherlands Dance
Theater. To help us survive the two years it apparently is
going to take for this choreographer to come forth with a new
ballet for ABT, we are to get a re-working by the Bolshoi's
Vladimir Vasiliev of Mikhail Baryshnikov's version of that
old warhorse, "Don Quixote."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In none of their interviews did the directors say a single
word about Mark Morris, whose "Drink to Me Only With Thine
Eyes," commissioned by Mr. Baryshnikov in 1988, is both
surpassingly beautiful and -- though it only was accorded two
performances in the current ABT season -- a crowd pleaser.
They said scarcely more about Twyla Tharp. From what they did
say, it's hard to believe that Ms. Hermann and Mr. Smith
realize how fortunate they are to have a new ballet by her in
the current season's repertoire, as well as enough hits by
her to make up an entire evening.
   There's little doubt that this Tharp triple bill excited
the audience as much as anything presented all season. "Push
Comes to Shove," it's true, wanted edge. But, then, it's no
less an ensemble piece than a star vehicle, and the ensemble
looked under-rehearsed, while Gil Boggs, in the role created
in 1976 by Mr. Baryshnikov, showed none of the latter's comic
flair. "In the Upper Room" also looked as if it needed more
rehearsal, but came off better. Its association of order with
energy is theatrically potent, and the audience greeted the
final curtain with the kind of roar that signifies
identification as well as excitement. "Nine Sinatra Songs,"
new to the repertoire, sent waves of euphoria rolling through
the auditorium.
   The Sinatra ballet is a good example of what Ms. Tharp has
to offer ABT -- apart, that is, from a brilliant work, in
which ballroom dancing, enhanced by virtuosity, illuminates
behavior, feelings and the vagaries of human nature. At the
same time, the piece does wonders for the performers,
especially those who, like Susan Jaffe, Christine Dunham and
Amanda McKerrow, have talent but seem incapable of realizing
it fully without better artistic guidance than they evidently
get at ABT. Apart from Leslie Browne, all the cast responds
to the technical challenges of "Nine Sinatra Songs" with a
whole heartedness that transmutes proficiency into art. The
metamorphosis of Ms. McKerrow was one of the season's big
pleasures. For the first time, she looked not like a
promising neophyte but a mature artist. Maybe in due course
Twyla Tharp could even rescue Ms. Browne.
   The choreographer's ability to isolate the essential gifts
of a particular dancer has never been more clearly in
evidence than in her handling of Cheryl Yeager, whom Ms.
Tharp cast as the female lead in her new piece for ABT,
"Brief Fling." Until Ms. Yeager appeared in this ballet, her
artistic resources seemed limited to a combination of
pertness and a disarming, if unfocused buoyancy. "Brief
Fling" gave her the chance to show that she has something
more interesting to offer. In the case of her partner, Julio
Bocca, Ms. Tharp has extended his range and concentrated his
gifts.
   Both Ms. Yeager and Mr. Bocca perform at breathtaking
speed the most dazzling steps and combinations. Because the
choreographer has so clear an understanding of the different
capabilities of male and female dancers, she makes their
prowess complementary as well as competitive, and thus a
metaphor of sexual harmony. In demonstrating the resources of
classical ballet technique, Ms. Tharp tests the pair to the
limits of speed, precision, daring and stamina. The results
are exhilarating -- not simply because the dancers exemplify
an ideal freedom from ordinary physical limitations, but
because they also embody an energy that transcends mere
physicality.
   In composing these dances, as well as those for the two
pairs of demi-soloists -- Claudia Alfieri and Gil Boggs, and
Isabella Padovani and Robert Wallace or Johan Renvall -- Ms.
Tharp shows a thorough mastery of ballet technique. The same,
unfortunately, cannot be said of Mr. Kylian, Mr. Kudelka, Mr.
Tetley and Ms. Marin, nor of that current ABT favorite, Agnes
de Mille, whose foolish and glib "Fall River Legend" has just
been disinterred by the new ABT management.
   Like so many of Ms. Tharp's works, "Brief Fling"
juxtaposes classical ballet with the choreographer's
idiosyncratic postmodern choreography, the latter wonderfully
performed by Jamie Bishton, Kevin O'Day, Keith Roberts and
Shelley Washington. There is no conflict between the two
kinds of dance, only an illuminating dissimilarity. "Brief
Fling" is at once about co-existence and variety. Properly
understood, the piece demonstrates how ballet can survive
after the death of Balanchine, whose work has brought an
entire phase of the art to a glorious but inhibiting
conclusion.

   FDA Plans to Propose New Rules
   For Nutritional Labeling on Food
   ----

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The first overhaul of federal food-labeling
rules in 17 years would allow food makers to provide
consumers with a "nutritional profile" of every serving they
eat.
   The Food and Drug Administration, as part of a major
initiative to require nutritional labels on almost all
packaged foods, is about to propose a way for consumers to
compare the nutrients in a food serving with the recommended
daily allowances for fat, saturated and unsaturated fatty
acids, salt, cholesterol, fiber and potassium.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
disclosed the proposal yesterday when he gave further details
on three food-labeling rules that are to be formally proposed
within a week or so.
   For the first time, consumers would be able to tell from a
label what their daily intake of the seven substances should
be and what one serving of a particular food would furnish.
Though there is a growing clamor for such health-related
information, the food industry hasn't been able to provide
so-called nutritional profiles because the government has
never set recommended daily allowances for those seven
nutrients. Under the sweeping new rules, the FDA would fill
this regulatory void by setting what it calls "reference
values."
   For food companies, adding nutritional profiles to their
labels would be optional because many food packages aren't
large enough for them. But it appears likely that a large
share of the industry would provide the profiles. A survey
commissioned by the National Food Processors Association
showed a strong consumer preference for a label format with a
nutritional profile. Of 400 consumers polled, 80% found the
nutritional profile of breakfast cereal "very helpful."
   "Consumers should have full access to information that
will help them make informed choices about the food they
eat," Dr. Sullivan said here at a food safety and nutrition
conference. "Simply put, Americans must be helped, not hyped
or hustled, in the supermarket."
   The HHS secretary is in a race with Congress to revamp the
nation's food-labeling requirements. Floor action is expected
next month on labeling bills sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman
(D., Calif.) and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio). Some in
Congress believe that Dr. Sullivan, sensing the political
appeal of comprehensive food labeling, is trying to steal the
march on lawmakers.
   Consumer advocates welcome the competition. "If Congress
adopts the legislation this summer, the FDA will be simply
one step ahead in implementing it," says Bruce Silverglade, a
lawyer for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
Washington-based consumer group. "The {parallel} efforts,
although competitive politically, are complementary in a
practical sense."
   But Dr. Sullivan is running into resistance within the
White House. Strenuous objections from Richard Darman, the
White House budget director, thwarted the HHS secretary's
plan to publish three new regulations this week in the
Federal Register as well as a tentative final rule that would
define such terms as "cholesterol free" and "low
cholesterol."
   The snag in the regulations is the volatile issue of
federal pre-emption.
   The triad of rules, among other things, would require
nutrition labeling on virtually all packaged foods and would
define serving size for 159 food categories, ranging from
jelly to breads. Currently, just 61% of the food products
regulated by the FDA carry nutritional labels, many of which
are added voluntarily by manufacturers.
   Dr. Sullivan, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills say these rules should
pre-empt state and local labeling laws. They fear that a
hodgepodge of labeling requirements would disrupt food
production and distribution in the U.S. and impede trade. But
Mr. Darman and other White House officials regard federal
pre-emption as running counter to the principles of
federalism and states' rights embraced by President Bush.
They also are sensitive to Mr. Bush's concerns about
reregulation tendencies in his administration.
   Yet to be resolved, administration officials say, is
whether the proposed rules will be silent on federal
pre-emption or whether the FDA will seek public comment on
the issue.
   The food industry has been adamant on the need for
regulatory uniformity. "Make no mistake," says John Cady,
president of the food processors group, "different food
safety and labeling requirements will impose very substantial
added costs to our national food distribution system." Adds
C. Manly Molpus, president of the Grocery Manufacturers of
America: "When it comes to what diet and health information
goes on food labels, there can be only one cook in the
kitchen."
   But consumer groups oppose federal pre-emption. The
industry "just wants to preclude more stringent state
labeling requirements," including freshness dating and
organic-food labeling laws, Mr. Silverglade says.
   The thrust of the labeling package is to help consumers
make sense out of a welter of confusing and often conflicting
nutritional information as food companies increasingly rely
on health claims as a marketing tool. Under current
regulations, nutritional labels are required only when a
company makes a nutritional claim or adds vitamins, minerals
or protein to a product.
   Yesterday, Dr. Sullivan said nutritional labeling would be
required on every packaged-food product that is a "meaningful
source" of nutrients. Food sold by restaurants, bakeries and
other small businesses would be exempt from the proposed
rule, as would spices and bite-size food, such as mints and
penny candies. Supermarkets would be required to post
nutritional information on fruit, vegetables, fish and
seafood or distribute booklets to shoppers.
   On the top half of a typical label, the FDA would require
food companies to list the number of calories from fat per
serving, as well as the amount of saturated fatty acids,
cholesterol and total dietary fiber. Currently, only figures
for protein, carbohydrates fat and calories are required.
   On the bottom half, the agency now requires companies to
list the percentage of recommended daily allowances per
serving of eight nutrients: protein, vitamin A, vitamin C,
thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium and iron. Under its new
rules, the FDA would make the listing of thiamine, riboflavin
and niacin optional, and would only require protein on foods
for infants and young children.
   The agency also proposes switching from recommended daily
allowances, or RDAs, to an internationally used term,
"reference daily intakes," or RDIs, for the sake of
uniformity. At the same time, the agency would update the
RDIs for protein, 12 vitamins and seven minerals. In
addition, it would set RDIs for seven other nutrients,
including vitamin K, manganese and selenium.

   Japanese Insurer to Pay $312 Million
   For 9.6% Interest in Lincoln National
   ----

   Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. agreed to pay $312
million for a nearly 10% stake in Lincoln National Corp., in
a transaction that marks the largest Japanese investment in a
U.S. insurer.
   Dai-Ichi's investment in the Fort Wayne, Ind., multiline
insurer is dwarfed by the $5.25 billion acquisition of
Farmers Group by B.A.T Industries of Britain in 1988. But
analysts and investment bankers believe Dai-Ichi's alliance
with Lincoln National could signal the beginning of more
Japanese investment in U.S. insurance companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Japanese financial-services companies made major
investments in several securities and money-management firms
during the 1980s, but their involvement in the U.S. insurance
industry has until now been limited.
   "There will be more globalization going both ways,"
especially since there is a growing perception that
financial-services companies will have to be both better
capitalized and global to compete in the 1990s, says William
Yankus, an insurance industry analyst with Conning &amp; Co.
   Yet, the Japanese may follow a different path for
investment in U.S. insurers than European companies have,
bankers say. In the last 10 years, British, European and
Scandinavian insurers have scooped up entire U.S. insurance
companies. Besides Farmers Group, other major acquisitions
include Prudential PLC's purchase of Jackson National Life
Insurance Co., Zurich Insurance Co.'s acquisition of Maryland
Casualty Co., and Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A.'s planned
acquisition of BMA Corp.'s Business Men's Assurance Co. unit.
   Gary Parr, a managing director with Wasserstein Perella &amp;
Co. in New York, which served as Lincoln National's
investment banker on the Dai-Ichi transaction, believes the
Japanese will take minority positions when investing in the
insurance industry, the same technique they have employed
when delving into the securities industry.
   The Japanese see obvious advantages in such an approach,
according to Mr. Parr. For example, it will allow Dai-Ichi,
Japan's second-largest life insurer, to learn about new
markets, study products and distribution systems, and also
service U.S. clients through affiliated companies.
   Carol Manning at Smith Barney Harris Upham says Japanese
financial-services firms also are eager to find ways to
diversify their investments. "When they can find a
well-managed U.S. life insurance company, {it} presents an
attractive investment."
   The proposed transaction offers Lincoln National a chance
to boost its already-strong balance sheet by acquiring
capital "on a very attractively priced basis," President Ian
M. Rolland said in an interview. Analysts said the investment
by Dai-Ichi allowed Lincoln to raise equity capital on far
better terms than it could have gotten if it sold convertible
stock on the open market.
   Mr. Rolland also cited the opportunity the alliance offers
"to enter into a number of strategic relationships with
Dai-Ichi." As part of the agreement, Lincoln National and the
Tokyo concern plan to develop "reciprocal business
relationships" in the areas of investment management,
reinsurance, pension products and group health products.
   Also a plus, Mr. Rolland said, is "having a shareholder
that understands the life insurance business and will take a
long-term view." As part of the agreement, Dai-Ichi signed a
standstill pact under which it pledged not to boost its
voting stake above 9.8%, or to participate in any group
gathering shares. The pact also requires Dai-Ichi to hold the
shares into 1993, and places restrictions on how the company
can trade them after that date.
   Under terms of the agreement, Dai-Ichi will purchase two
new series of Lincoln National convertible preferred stock: a
5% stake through one issue of convertible preferred stock and
a 4.6% share through a second series of convertible preferred
within a year.
   The planned alliance will "enhance Lincoln National's
ability to deal in the global marketplace," said Legg Mason
Wood Walker analyst Frederick Sandburg. But the agreement
"doesn't mean a whole lot, short-term, in terms of the
company's earnings," he noted.
   Takahide Sakurai, president of Dai-Ichi Mutual, said in a
statement that the company considers Lincoln National "a
highly regarded and soundly managed company," adding that the
transaction "offers us a good investment opportunity."
   Lincoln National offers life and property-casualty
insurance as well as employee-benefit programs. In 1988, the
company took a $67.1 million charge to dispose of certain
unprofitable health-maintenance organizations; the remaining
HMO's recently returned to profitability and analysts
consider that once-troubled operation to have turned the
corner.
   In May, Lincoln completed the sale of its National
Reinsurance unit to an investor group that includes financier
Robert M. Bass; it received $320.1 million in cash and $75
million in preferred stock. Those funds, and the money to be
received from the Dai-Ichi plan, will be used to pay down
debt, said Lincoln.
   The agreement between Dai-Ichi and Lincoln National will
take effect after the required waiting period under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, the companies
said.

   Chrysler to Acquire Dollar Rent A Car,
   Eyeing Broader Market in Rental Sector

   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- In a move to secure a broader
market for its cars in the auto rental industry, Chrysler
Corp. said it agreed to acquire Dollar Rent A Car Systems
Inc. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Dollar is the third rental-car company Chrysler has
purchased within the past year. But with a world-wide fleet
of 80,000 cars and annual revenue of $600 million, Dollar is
nearly twice as large as Thrifty Rent-a-Car System Inc.,
which the auto maker bought last year for $264 million. Last
year Chrysler paid $40 million for Snappy Rental Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts viewed the move as part of the continuing trend
by auto makers to buy rental companies, which purchase
millions of vehicles annually for their fleets. "It makes
perfect sense if you can capture your biggest customer," says
Charles H. Finnie of Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore.
   Chrysler officials said they intend to boost their share
of Dollar's fleet from the current 25% level. While Dollar
franchisees have the right to buy vehicles from any auto
maker, a Dollar spokeswoman said: "We think we have the
ability to structure deals that make it better for them
{franchisees} to buy cars from Chrysler than from somebody
else."
   Chrysler isn't alone in this buy-the-customer approach to
protecting high-volume buyers from rival companies. Ford
Motor Co. has put money into Hertz Corp. and Budget Rent A
Car Corp. General Motors Corp. has done the same with Avis
Inc. and National Car Rental System. Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
of Japan yesterday completed its acquisition of Value Rent A
Car Inc.
   Chrysler, however, has had some problems making the
strategy work smoothly. Just two months ago, Chrysler
officials surprised the rental market by allowing Thrifty to
purchase a large block of cars from Mitsubishi Motors.
Chrysler officials said they wouldn't force Thrifty to
purchase Chrysler vehicles that were higher priced than those
supplied by Mitsubishi.
   Yesterday, a Chrysler spokesman called the Mitsubishi
decision an isolated incident, not an indication of a retreat
from the rental fleet sales business.
   Chrysler said it isn't planning to merge Dollar with the
operations of its other rental car agencies, Thrifty or
Snappy Rental Inc. The three companies now give Chrysler a
presence in three different segments of the rental industry.
Snappy specializes in the business of providing replacement
vehicles for people who require them mostly as a result of
insurance coverage after an accident.
   Dollar has rental facilities in airport terminals, rather
than at nearby off-airport locations out of which Thrifty
operates. Eight of 10 Dollar customers are business
travelers, while less than half of Thrifty's customers rent
vehicles for business purposes.
   "Dollar will continue to operate independently under its
existing brand names," the company said in a statement. The
auto maker will acquire Dollar through Pentastar, its
subsidiary that also owns Thrifty and Snappy. Henry J.
Caruso, Dollar's president and owner, will be retained by
Chrysler as a consultant.
   Mr. Caruso, who will not maintain an equity interest in
Dollar, founded the company in 1966 as a single rental car
outlet.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Chrysler closed at $15.75, down 37.5 cents.

   Poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and forced labor have
robbed many of the boys and girls in India's capital of their
childhood, according to a new United Nations report titled
"The Invisible Child."
   The UNICEF report said more than 500,000 children, 80% of
them illiterate and many underfed, are forced to work in New
Delhi, where the per capita income of the city's 800 million
inhabitants is about $410.
   Child labor is only outlawed in India for certain
hazardous jobs. Many of the children are latter-day slaves,
the report said. "The children have to put up with long
working hours, eight to 12 hours a day," the report said.
"They face verbal, physical and sexual abuse from most people
who deal with them."
   The report said a survey of parents in the slums found
that less than 5% wanted their children to stop working. They
just wanted labor conditions to improve.
                                                                                                       

   TAIWAN'S DRIFT-NET BAN
                                                                                                       

   Taiwan's drift-net fleet won't be allowed to operate in
the South Pacific after July 1, 1991, a government official
said. Lee Chien-chuan, director of the Agriculture Council
Fisheries Department, said the ban was in reaction to
criticism of drift nets for their indiscriminate depletion of
marine life. He said Taiwan has already cut its drift-net
fleet in the South Pacific to 24 vessels from 60.
                                                                                                       

   SAS WANTS WEST BERLIN RIGHTS
                                                                                                       

   Scandinavian Airlines System said it requested permission
to fly to West Berlin's Tegel Airport. Presently, only
airlines of the U.S., Britain and France -- the Allied powers
-- are allowed to fly to West Berlin. SAS, which is 50%-owned
by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, believes it
is the first non-Allied power airline to request West Berlin
landing rights since the Wall fell in November. The Swedish
Foreign Ministry applied to the French, U.S. and British
embassies in Bonn and the West German Foreign Ministry for
the landing rights.
                                                                                                       

   THE DWINDLING RAIN FOREST
                                                                                                       

   Brazil's Science and Technology Secretary Jose Goldemberg
said ranchers and farmers in 1988 and 1989 cut down nearly
18,000 square miles of the Amazon rain forest, the news
service Agencia Brasil reported. Mr. Goldemberg was quoted as
saying that the figures were based on satellite photos.
Separately, the European Community yesterday called for
urgent talks with Brazil on saving the Amazon rain forest
before it's all wiped out.
                                                                                                       

   STAYING PUT IN LONDON
                                                                                                       

   In the wake of recent announcements first by Manufacturers
Hanover Corp. and then by American Express Co. that they were
taking space in London's Canary Wharf office complex, Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. said it has decided against taking 240,000 square
feet in the 4 billion ($6.91 billion) development on the
north bank of the Thames. A Merrill official in New York
explained that flagging conditions in London's financial
market persuaded the securities firm to remain in its present
London quarters. Canary Wharf, an Olympia &amp; York Developments
project, is now about half rented.
                                                                                                       

   APPEAL TO TOKYO
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Federation of Economic Organizations, a powerful
group of business leaders, called on the government to lift
restrictions on rice imports as one way to ensure the success
of the so-called Uruguay round of multilateral trade
negotiations. Despite strong pressures from the U.S., Japan
has steadfastly refused to abolish the ban on rice imports,
claiming that rice-farming has a special status in Japan. In
the past, the federation indicated that the government should
allow some rice imports, but it made its position clearer
this time by saying there should be no sanctuary in trade.
                                                                                                       

   A POLITICAL POLL IN FRANCE
                                                                                                       

   French business executives generally lack confidence in
President Francois Mitterrand and favor two outsiders, rather
than established party leaders, as future presidential
candidates, according to a poll published yesterday in the
newspaper Le Figaro.
   The survey of 800 executives said only 42% of the
respondents expressed confidence in Mr. Mitterrand. By
contrast, 64% expressed confidence in Premier Michel Rocard,
but he trailed Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, as the person whom the executives would most like
to see play a major public role.
   Mr. Delors also was the executives' choice to be the next
Socialist candidate for president, backed by 43% of the
respondents compared with 38% for Mr. Rocard and 7% for the
president of the National Assembly, Laurent Fabius.
   The first choice for joint candidate of France's two main
rightist parties was Lyon Mayor Michel Noir.

   Travel:
   Fliers Feel the Pinch in Tighter Seats

   Reading anything wider than Reader's Digest on a plane
these days probably means jabbing a seatmate with your elbow.
Airlines, trying to squeeze more profit out of each flight,
are squeezing most passengers into tighter, narrower seats.
   "The No. 1 complaint is the ever-shrinking economy-class
seat," says Michael Ashington-Pickett, publisher of
Ashington-Pickett Airlines and Travel Reports, a travel
newsletter that surveys executives who fly frequently. Mr.
Ashington-Pickett's readers rank "tight, cramped seating"
miles above other annoyances such as flight delays, high
fares or bad food.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "People are uncomfortable, miserable and complaining about
it," he says.
   There's a basis for their complaints. Even as the U.S.
population in general, and middle-aged baby boomers in
particular, develop broader backsides, airlines have had
aircraft makers chop seat widths -- typically to about 19
inches now from the 22 inches provided for many years -- as
well as make aisles narrower, to get in more seats. Pitch,
which is the seat spacing front-to-back, has been scrunched
in some cases to 31 inches from 34 inches, meaning there's
less legroom, too.
   "I think we are bumping up against some absolute
body-dimension limits right now," says Ed Perkins, editor of
Consumer Reports Travel Letter. "They're offering 90% of the
necessary room" for comfort, he claims. Safety's a concern,
too. Passenger advocates and flight attendants say the close
space impedes classic emergency procedures, such as assuming
the standard "crash" position.
   Carriers say they must pack in passengers to stay in
business. Deregulation of the industry and lower fares
created slim profit margins, making every seat count. "The
name of the game is how many people you can get into the
airplane," says John Casey, a vice president at industry
consultant Avmark Inc. "Yield for the carrier means its
survival or not."
   Airlines weren't especially forthcoming about the coziness
in their cabins, with most simply stressing that they are
within industry standards. Delta Air Lines, which Consumer
Reports Travel Letter's August 1989 issue shows offering
especially cramped space on most of its planes, says it isn't
getting complaints from customers.
   "We've had an excellent passenger service record," boasts
a Delta spokesman. "If we were jamming people in, I don't
think that would be the case."
   Mr. Perkins says that may only mean that, in airline and
government surveys, fliers are asked about service overall
and not about seats specifically. Besides, he says, most
passengers don't know that airlines are to blame for the
skimpy seating. "People don't realize that seat size is
controllable by the airline," he says. "They think it just
comes from Boeing that way."
   Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. and other aircraft
makers follow the orders of airlines, which want more seats.
Some Boeing 747s have been reconfigured to 10 seats abreast
from nine; McDonnell Douglas's DC-10 now often has nine seats
across, up from eight.
   As for questions on safety, Kathleen Rosenauer, a
spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association that represents
all major U.S. airlines, points out that carriers are
required to meet standards set by the Federal Aviation
Administration. "There's no way we would configure an
aircraft that didn't meet FAA standards," she says.
   The industry's "high-density" strategy actually began in
the mid-1970s before deregulation, as a response to wild
fluctuations in oil prices and jet fuel costs. As passengers
were squeezed more and more, airlines demanded innovations
from their manufacturers to reduce discomfort, such as
thinner, firmer cushions, thinner armrests and curved seat
legs.
   But airplanes fly 60% to 80% full these days -- another
byproduct of deregulation -- and chances are that passengers
will sit shoulder-to-shoulder with another traveler.
(Shoulders, say U.S. Army studies, as well as hips, are
getting wider.) It has become more difficult to disguise the
crunch.
   "They treat us like we can't tell the difference,"
complains Michael Turner, who flies about twice a week as
chief operating officer for Restaurant Administration
Services, a Wendy's International franchisee based in
Orlando, Fla. The 50-year-old executive says he plans to
avoid carriers that "squeeze us like cattle. I'm going to
vote with my dollars."
   A few airlines are accommodating passengers tired of being
squeezed by other carriers: They have turned spacious seating
into a marketing tool. Alaska Air Group's Alaska Airlines
touts two inches more legroom in its economy class than the
industry average. American Airlines, on its planes flying the
highly competitive Los Angeles-San Francisco route,
guarantees a 36-inch pitch. Midwest Express, which flies out
of Milwaukee, offers 25-inch-wide leather seats and a 34-inch
pitch on all planes. And the airlines say prices on these
routes are still competitive with those of carriers with
denser seating.
   Passengers with the wherewithal can buy comfort on almost
any flight. "The guy who pays the most gets the most room,"
says A.J. Merrett, commercial director of Aircraft Furnishing
Ltd., a British seat supplier for Boeing and others.
First-class and business-class seats, typically much more
costly, are also roomier.
   People who can't pay extra are requesting aisle seats more
than ever. "Businessmen used to want the window so they could
work," says Eileen Umhoefer, president of Spirit of Travel
and a Denver travel agent for 30 years. "Now they always want
the aisle," which is her preference as well.
   Other cramped passengers develop methods of coping. Ali
Atif, a 6-foot-2, University of Houston student, pulls his
legs back by balancing his feet on his toes in order to fit
into his seat. He admits the maneuver is useless, however,
when the passenger ahead of him reclines.
   Sometimes nothing works. Carolyn Riviere of Orlando
remembers her flight last December from Spokane, Wash., to
New Orleans. She and her husband, who is blind, had, as
usual, settled into two outer seats so he could have the
aisle, when an extremely large woman sat beside the window.
   "Her body was in my seat, I'd say by about a third," says
Mrs. Riviere. "I couldn't pull down my armrest because it was
behind her shoulder." Mrs. Riviere wrote the stewardess a
note, with no results. After ordering a glass of wine, she
couldn't reach her purse to pay, all three were lodged in so
tightly.
   In the July 1989 crash landing of a United Airlines DC-10
in Sioux City, Iowa, some tall passengers couldn't assume a
bent-over, braced crash position because there wasn't enough
space, says Richard Livingston, chairman and chief executive
of the Airline Passengers Association of North America. Mr.
Livingston also contends that closely placed seats can hamper
evacuation. (United Airlines says it doesn't think it's
appropriate for an individual carrier to comment on a safety
matter.)
   "We believe that the trend should be reversed," Mr.
Livingston says, so "that instead of holding pitch steady or
decreasing it, we should be increasing it." His organization,
a consumer group, plans to file a petition with the FAA on
the dangers of tight seating. More room, he says, would
"enhance the evacuation process and enable far more
passengers to assume the crash position." The Association of
Flight Attendants, a union, has already formally written to
the FAA requesting action to require more space at exits.
   An FAA spokesman asserted that in the Sioux City crash,
all of the passengers would have been able to assume a
secondary crash position, which basically can be done by
leaning forward on the seatback ahead. The agency believes
the alternate position is as safe as the bent-over one
preferred by consumer groups.
   The FAA requires airlines to demonstrate that a plane can
be evacuated within 90 seconds, even with half the exits
blocked. It also regulates aisle widths and access to exits
but has never specifically tested the size or placement of
seats in relation to safety.
   Mr. Perkins from Consumer Reports professes "serious
concerns as to whether the seats are so terribly close
together as to impede evacuations." Although all aircraft are
tested by the FAA every year, Mr. Perkins says these tests
can't account for passengers' panic. "Your mental attitude is
different when you're sitting in smoke and there's a fire
roaring 10 feet behind you," he notes.
   "The test isn't intended to simulate panic or any specific
accident scenario," an FAA spokesman says, but the agency
feels the test is "conservative" because of other criteria,
like the blocked exits, that are considered in an evaluation.
He adds that the FAA is studying "possible improvements with
regard to access to exits."

   Inside Track:
   AMR Chairman Sold Almost One-Fifth
   Of His Stake in Firm Early This Month

   NEW YORK -- Robert L. Crandall, chairman of American
Airlines parent AMR Corp., sold nearly one-fifth of his
holdings of the company's stock early this month.
   Mr. Crandall sold 6,250 AMR shares at $65.25 each, or a
total of $407,812, filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission show. Those sales left him with 26,000 shares.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman for AMR, based in Fort Worth, Texas, called
the sale "a personal decision by Mr. Crandall" and wouldn't
comment further.
   AMR closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading at $62.875, down 50 cents. Analysts recently lowered
their second-quarter earnings forecasts for the airline,
according to Zacks Investment Research. The second-quarter
consensus for AMR fell to $1.90 a share from $2.06 a share
about a month ago, Zacks said.
   Mr. Crandall "would have made a little bit more money (by
selling) last year," said Timothy Pettee, an analyst for
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. AMR stock was selling for about $105 last
year after Donald Trump disclosed that he owned some shares,
which he later sold.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Pettee said AMR is "building a
tremendous amount of longterm value and gaining market share
at a rather precipitous rate." He said American, which
recently acquired Latin American routes from Eastern Airlines
and is seeking to expand in the Far East, is growing at
nearly twice the rate of the rest of the airline industry by
some measures.
                                                                                                       

   SELLING HIGH-TECH: Executives at a number of technology
companies have been selling stock in recent weeks.
   The companies include Conner Peripherals Inc., Octel
Communications Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Silicon Valley
Group Inc. and Control Data Corp.
   Robert G. Herwick, an analyst with Hambricht &amp; Quist,
noted that stock options are often a significant part of
compensation packages at technology companies and executives
would be likely to sell when they can get a good price.
"Valuation of technology stocks has improved somewhat over
the last year," he said.
   In many cases, prices have risen since the executives
sold.
   The largest sale listed on the accompanying table was by
Finis Conner, chairman and chief executive officer of Conner
Peripherals, a San Jose, Calif., computer and data processing
firm. According to filings with the SEC, Mr. Conner sold
150,000 shares for nearly $3 million in early May. The sale
accounted for only 6% of his holdings, however; he still
holds more than two million shares.
   Mr. Conner couldn't be reached to comment. SEC filings
show that he sold the shares at $19.50 to $19.75 each; the
stock closed yesterday in over-the-counter trading at $25.25,
up 12.5 cents.
   At Octel Communications, a Milpitas, Calif., maker of
voice processing systems, the chief executive and several
vice presidents sold shares for $22.88 to $24.50 apiece. The
stock closed yesterday in OTC trading at $24.75, down $1.25.
   The president and chief executive, Robert Cohn, sold
61,000 shares for about $1.4 million. He holds about 319,000
shares. None of the Octel executives could be reached, and a
company spokesman wouldn't comment.
   A spokeswoman at Control Data in Minneapolis said two vice
presidents sold for personal reasons. Both sales were just a
portion of their holdings. At Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto,
Calif., a spokesman said shares sold by three vice presidents
were part of their incentive compensation, adding that the
sales were for personal reasons. The three sold less than
half of their holdings.
   William Egan, a director of Silicon Valley Group, sold his
entire holding of 145,375 shares for $1.5 million. Mr. Egan,
who is general partner in the Boston venture capital firm of
Burr, Egan, Deleage &amp; Co., said the shares were held on
behalf of several venture capital funds that were reaching
the end of their terms. "The company was doing well, and we
thought it was a good time" to sell, Mr. Egan said.
   The stock gained 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $13 in
OTC trading, compared with the $10 to $11.50 a share that Mr.
Egan received when he sold. Silicon Valley is a maker of
chip-making equipment.
                                                                                                       

   ANOTHER CHAIRMAN SELLS: John Masefield, chairman of
Isomedix Inc., sold 55,000 shares for $653,425 in May and
early this month. Filings with the SEC show that the sales
leave him with 139,750 shares and 76,510 warrants.
   Mr. Masefield couldn't be reached, and another official of
the Whippany, N.J., maker of medical equipment wouldn't
comment.
   The chairman would have done better to wait. Although he
sold at $11.75 to $12 a share, well above the 52-week low of
$8.13, the stock closed yesterday in OTC trading at $13.25,
down 12.5 cents.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Europeans Focus on U.S. Media Buyers

   Europeans have already taken over most of the oldest and
grandest names on Madison Avenue. J. Walter Thompson. Ted
Bates. Ogilvy &amp; Mather.
   That acquisition frenzy has cooled considerably, what with
a skittish economy and lessons learned from Britain's
overextended, acquisition-minded Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. But
industry executives say the Europeans appear poised to invade
another sector of their business: media buying.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Europe, media buying companies -- firms that do nothing
but buy commercial ad time and space on behalf of clients --
are common, buying as much as 40% and sometimes more of all
media in a given country. In the U.S., ad agencies still rule
that business, shepherding nearly all of the tens of billions
of dollars spent by clients annually on television time and
magazine and newspaper space. A number of media buying
companies have sprung up here since the 1980s, but most are
tiny, and none have yet met up to early expectations of
explosive growth.
   The Europeans, though, may change that soon. European
media and advertising firms have approached almost every U.S.
media buying firm of note on these shores. U.S. executives
say the Europeans speak of ultimately building sprawling
media-buying empires in the U.S., much the way they have
already in Europe.
   "They're all dancing around trying to enter the U.S.
market," says Gene DeWitt of DeWitt Media, who has reason to
know: His firm has been approached by several European firms,
even though it handles billings of just $100 million in a
$100 billion marketplace. "The Europeans look at the U.S. and
see 50% of the world's advertising billings here, so there's
no question that companies over there are lusting to get into
this market."
   Executives of perhaps the largest European media buyer,
London-based Aegis Group, were in town this week to meet with
investors and explain what media buying is all about. In an
interview, Roger Parry, the group's development director,
said that U.S. expansion "isn't first priority," and that
expanding in Europe and entering Scandinavia and the
Netherlands are more important. But he added, "We will always
consider America. We certainly wouldn't rule it out."
   Mr. Parry stressed that Aegis, whose Carat media buying
company handles $3.4 billion in billings across Europe, isn't
"actively seeking" any U.S. acquisition. But several media
buying firms in the U.S. said they had been contacted at one
time or another by Aegis, among others. Aegis, because of its
size -- it already buys more than 7% of all media across
Europe, and is gunning for 15% -- is expected to be among the
first to make inroads in the U.S.
   Among those with whom Aegis has held conversations is the
largest U.S. media buying service, Western Media
International in Los Angeles. Western's chief executive
officer, Dennis Holt, says the company handled billings of
$720 million last year for clients including Walt Disney. The
company has also been approached by other Europeans,
including London's WPP Group PLC, which owns Thompson and
Ogilvy.
   According to Mr. Holt, Western Media and Aegis have had
casual discussions over the past year and a half, and might
enter into a joint venture in Europe. But he says he doesn't
foresee selling out his own company in the near future,
because "we're successful on our own."
   Mr. Holt does, though, see enormous potential for European
companies interested in acquiring U.S. media buying
companies. By the year 2000, he predicts, 10% to 20% of all
U.S. media will be bought by media buying companies.
   And he says that with the increasing internationalization
of media -- at a time when behemoths like Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp. own TV stations, newspapers and satellite systems
across continents -- international media buying is sure to
follow; he envisions a day when Procter &amp; Gamble can buy ad
time across the U.S., Europe and the Eastern bloc at once.
   Major U.S. ad agencies scoff at that kind of talk. A
number of them are involved in media-buying consortiums
abroad, but say there's no place for that kind of business
here. At New York-based Omnicom Group, which had once looked
briefly at media buying services, "I can assure you we aren't
contemplating any such acquisition. I don't think it makes a
lot of sense in the U.S.," says Bruce Crawford, chairman.
   U.S. agencies reel off a laundry list of reasons why media
buying services -- homegrown and European imports -- will
never make the big time here. The media buying services claim
they can get big discounts by buying bulk. But agency
executives insist the services will never have the clout of
heavyweight agencies like Young &amp; Rubicam or Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Advertising, each with U.S. billings in excess of $2
billion.
   European media buying is different from U.S. media buying,
too, in ways that might be difficult to translate. The
European services tend to concentrate on print, for example,
while in the U.S. the emphasis is on television. And most
U.S. media buying services are private, making their true
value difficult for potential buyers to determine.
   But Aegis's Mr. Parry says the U.S. may be ripe for more
media buying services because, as the traditional TV networks
lose viewers to alternatives like cable and videocassettes,
media buying is becoming that much more complicated. "And the
more fragmented the {the media marketplace}, the stronger the
argument is for specialized buying," he says.
   Hal Katz of Katz Marketing &amp; Media, a media consulting
firm, also sees untapped opportunities for the Europeans:
"They have the mass and they have the multinational client
base to make inroads into the U.S. They may well be able to
do it."

   AD TAX UPDATE: Pennsylvania is the latest state that may
consider introducing an ad tax. Rep. Robert Reber, a
Republican from southeast Pennsylvania, has drafted a bill
calling for a 6% tax on local advertising that would be used
to fund mass transit. However, the proposal hasn't yet been
introduced, and in an interview, Mr. Reber said he drafted it
mainly to gauge reaction from other House members. "It's not
like it's ready to fly," he said. Similar ad tax proposals in
Rhode Island, New York and Kentucky were all defeated earlier
this year, according to the American Advertising Federation.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNTS: Hiram Walker Inc. chose the Chicago office
of Eisaman, Johns &amp; Laws to create U.S. advertising for
Beefeater Gin. The account, with billings of about $8
million, had been handled by MacNamara, Clapp &amp; Klein. Hiram
Walker took over U.S. marketing of Beefeater when it acquired
Buckingham Wile, Beefeater's American distributor, earlier
this year. Meanwhile, MacNamara Clapp said it picked up two
new accounts, for Angels Flight menswear and Ark Restaurants
in New York, which it expects will bill $2.5 million and $1
million-to-$2 million, respectively.

   Unveils Program
   To Reduce Costs

   PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Pinnacle West Capital Corp. expects to
cut a requested rate increase and boost debt repayment
through a sharp reduction in capital outlays and operating
expenditures at its Arizona Public Service unit, Richard
Snell, chairman, president and chief executive, said.
   Included in the utility holding company's cost-squeezing
plan is a revised rate application with Arizona regulators
that will be markedly lower than a current request for a 6.8%
rate hike in each of the next three years, Mr. Snell said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The current rate request, filed in January, has become a
target of sniping between Pinnacle West and PacifiCorp.
PacifiCorp, Portland, Ore., has made an unsolicited $1.82
billion takeover offer for Pinnacle West, earning local
political support with a promise to raise rates by 2%
annually over the three-year period.
   Pinnacle West has rebuffed PacifiCorp's overtures, saying
that it wants to remain independent. PacifiCorp officials
have hinted strongly that they may pursue Pinnacle West on a
hostile basis.
   Pinnacle West's Mr. Snell, in an interview, reiterated the
company's plan to remain independent, outlining in broad
terms efforts to extract itself from nearly-disastrous
divisification moves and to pay down debt. He said there had
been no contacts of late between representatives of the two
companies.
   Mr. Snell declined to disclose the rates Arizona Public
Service will seek in its revised application but made it
clear that the utility won't be matching PacifiCorp's
promised 2% annually.
   A key component of its cost-reduction plan will be a
reduction of about $500 million from previously planned
capital outlays. Among other things, Arizona Public Service,
with one of the fastest growth rates in the country, has
slowed of late, adding a projected 11,000 new customers this
year compared to annual averages of about 30,000 a few years
ago.
   Last year, the utility spent about $270 million on capital
outlays, down from an earlier-budgeted $300 million. Spending
this year will total about $254 million, and annual outlays
for 1991 to 1993 will be about $200 million under the revised
plan.
   On the operating side, Mr. Snell suggested that there will
be reductions but declined to disclose details. He said that
"going forward there will be job reductions, not necessarily
layoffs." The utility, which already has reduced its work
force to 7,700 from a peak of 9,100, said earlier this month
that its job reductions would exceed the 150 already slated
for this year.
   Over the next few years, Mr. Snell said Arizona Public
Service's parent, Pinnacle West, will pay down much of its
debt; repayment of more than $600 million is projected. At
March 31, Pinnacle West had $1.13 of its own long-term debt.
The consolidated total was $3.53 billion, including debt of
the utility unit.
   Pinnacle West expects to repay about $200 million of its
debt this year, among other things, through cash flow from
the $211 million in dividends annually from Arizona Public
Service and the proceeds of asset sales. The company has paid
$95 million of the projected total to date.

   Shearson, Cohen Agree to $10 Million Severance Accord

   NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s former chairman
Peter A. Cohen has reached a severance pact with Shearson
that will pay him $10 million or more in salary and benefits,
people familiar with the agreement said.
   The pact -- which includes some unusual provisions
regarding future liability of Mr. Cohen's former bosses and
their families -- ends one of Wall Street's most difficult
executive divorces.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Five months ago, Mr. Cohen was ousted as Shearson's
chairman and chief executive officer as part of a major
shake-up orchestrated by the firm's parent, American Express
Co. Because of his high profile, and the bitterness
surrounding the financial problems of the U.S.'s
second-biggest brokerage firm, Mr. Cohen's departure and his
private severance negotiations with his former employer have
drawn intense interest on Wall Street.
   Shearson officials have wanted to get Mr. Cohen's
departure behind them so the firm -- which is in the process
of changing its name back to Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. --
can go forward and recover from nearly a year of management
and financial turmoil.
   But the 43-year-old Mr. Cohen won't be going away soon. As
part of the agreement, he will remain a Shearson "consultant"
until March 1991 and remain on the firm's payroll until the
end of November 1991, with a secretary and office paid for by
Shearson. This setup allows Mr. Cohen to receive the rest of
certain company benefits to which he's entitled, according to
Shearson officials.
   Even by Wall Street standards, the financial terms of Mr.
Cohen's severance pact are eye-openers.
   Mr. Cohen worked for Shearson for nearly 20 years and
amassed a large and intricate web of holdings of Shearson and
American Express securities. All these holdings had to be
unwound.
   According to the people familiar with the agreement, much
of the $10 million or more Mr. Cohen will be paid represents
the resolution of complex stock and options agreements he
had; about $2.6 million of the pact represents severance pay,
and that basically offsets loans Mr. Cohen owed to Shearson
as part of a stock-purchase program. The ultimate value of
Mr. Cohen's package isn't yet certain. Depending on how his
securities holdings are valued, and other variables, he could
receive closer to $15 million, some people familiar with the
pact said.
   Gary Beller, American Express general counsel, said in a
statement that the settlement is "fair and equitable" and
recognizes Mr. Cohen's contributions to Shearson for nearly
20 years. "We wish him well in his future endeavors," the
statement said. American Express and Shearson wouldn't
comment further.
   Mr. Cohen declined to comment. His attorney, Stanley
Arkin, wouldn't discuss the terms of the agreement, but said
in a statement: "The matter was resolved in a way which
appropriately recognizes Peter's many years of significant
contributions to Shearson Lehman Hutton. Peter is a talented,
energetic executive who looks forward to new adventures and
accomplishments in the years to come."
   In Shearson's latest annual report, the firm took the
unusual step of devoting a full page to its former chief,
including a small photograph of him. "Our strengths" in
brokerage and investment banking, the annual report says,
"are, in large part, the result of Peter's vision and
leadership."
   Privately, however, American Express and its chairman,
James D. Robinson III, have blamed much of Shearson's
problems on what the company portrays as Mr. Cohen's
overreaches -- including his acquisition of ailing E.F.
Hutton &amp; Co. for $1 billion in 1988 and Shearson's failed
role in the RJR Nabisco Inc. takeover. Some friends of Mr.
Cohen's say some American Express board members wanted to use
the severance negotiations to punish the former Shearson
chief.
   It's clear that relations between the departed chief and
his former bosses aren't good. American Express's board,
which handled the negotiations, brought in former Iran-Contra
prosecutor Arthur Liman to represent it. And Mr. Cohen hired
Mr. Arkin, who has handled two prominent cases that caused
headaches for American Express. (Mr. Arkin represented banker
Edmond Safra, the victim of a smear campaign by certain
American Express employees, and Salim B. Lewis, who pleaded
guilty to manipulating a stock offering by Fireman's Fund
Corp., then an American Express unit.)
   Included in Mr. Cohen's severance pact, according to
American Express executives and others familiar with it, are
a series of legal "releases" in which Mr. Cohen is prevented
from suing all directors and officers of American Express and
Shearson, as well as their families.
   Legal experts were surprised by the extra provision
protecting the families of Mr. Cohen's former bosses.
   Speaking generally, Thomas Russo, a partner at Cadwalader,
Wickersham &amp; Taft, said: "It is somewhat unusual to go beyond
the parties involved {in release provisions}. I've never seen
it, actually. But remember, severance agreements are
individually negotiated. They're not cookiecutter
agreements."
   He added: "People want freedom from liability. And the
liability issue is often a very important part of any
negotiation because people just want to totally sever the
relationship and don't want to worry about subsequent
lawsuits."
   Some securities executives speculate that the release
provisions in Mr. Cohen's pact are partly to protect Mr.
Robinson's wife, Linda, a well-known public relations
official who played a major behind-the-scenes role in the RJR
takeover efforts that eventually soured for Mr. Cohen and
Shearson. (RJR was taken private in a record $25 billion
leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which was
a rival of Shearson in the RJR takeover battle.) It is
believed that Mr. Cohen resented Ms. Robinson for what Mr.
Cohen saw as attempts by her to undermine his position at
Shearson both during the RJR fight and at other times.
   Ms. Robinson yesterday wouldn't comment on the severance
agreement. But she denied she was out to get Mr. Cohen. She
said she stood by a quotation in a recent interview in Vanity
Fair magazine, in which she said: "The story that I wanted
Peter Cohen to take the fall-that theory is pathetic and
implausible. My husband was defending Peter Cohen. I only
rooted for Peter Cohen to succeed, for his failure would only
have hurt Jim."
   Mr. Liman, the American Express lawyer, said the
wide-ranging releases involving family members were "my idea"
to prevent any future lawsuits. "It was an idea the board
authorized," Mr. Liman said, "because given the kind of
history of press accounts, I felt very strongly that I didn't
want to work out a severance agreement that had releases only
to have litigation by proxy. There was going to have to be
universal peace."

   JERSEY CITY, N.J. -- In 1982, Earl Aldredge, a Vietnam
veteran who vowed to track down industrial polluters,
literally unearthed what has become New Jersey's biggest
environmental-cleanup problem.
   Working as a volunteer for Jersey City, the 300-pound Mr.
Aldredge, outfitted as always in his cowboy boots, 10-gallon
hat and cowboy shirt with "Toxic Tex" embroidered in
rhinestones, discovered white, yellow and green crystals
growing on surface soil around the city. State testing
verified that the crystals were chromium, a potentially
hazardous substance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sifting through city demolition permits, Mr. Aldredge
tracked the chromium waste back to local slag piles. He then
began hounding the state to take action. "He was so
persistent that you couldn't ignore him," says Thomas McKee,
the state enforcement agent working on the case.
   Eight years later, Mr. Aldredge's persistence has evolved
into a complicated -- and potentially expensive -- legal
wrangle for three companies that the state blames for the
slag. The problem is especially nettlesome for PPG Industries
Inc. of Pittsburgh. Until 1964, PPG's plant, located in the
heart of the city, processed chromium ore to make paint
pigments. The resulting slag -- iron laced with chromium and
other chemicals -- was then trucked and used as landfill in
at least 58 sites in Jersey City alone, according to the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.
   Burying industrial wastes was once common in the chemical
industry. But now, past actions are being judged under new
standards. The upshot: More and more environmental skeletons
are being unearthed and are coming back to haunt companies
such as PPG.
   "Environmental problems always are a potential
blind-side," says Charles Locastro, a securities analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. PPG, he says, is well managed
and "pretty conscientious about dealing with environmental
problems." Yet he expects it to put in reserves as much as
$30 million to $40 million annually for a number of years to
handle problems such as those at Jersey City.
   The Department of Environmental Protection has ordered PPG
to pay $31.5 million to clean up some of the Jersey City
sites, the ones in residential areas. If PPG refuses, the
department could go to court and perhaps get that sum
trebled. The order has forced PPG to negotiate on a
settlement after years of stonewalling, says Michael Schuit,
a state regulatory lawyer involved in the discussions. Mr.
Schuit says PPG's attorneys have privately estimated its
total cleanup costs at $200 million to $300 million. PPG
calls those figures speculative.
   During New Jersey's eight-year pursuit of PPG, state
regulators have built their case against the company.
Voluminous documents, including sworn statements from former
PPG employees and internal PPG reports subpoenaed by the
state, show that company officials knew back in the 1950s
that the chromium wastes posed at least minor health risks.
   PPG says that the state can't prove which slag came from
which company, and that PPG won't take responsibility for
slag it didn't produce. It also terms the state's cleanup
standards too stringent. Though refusing to disclose the
amount it has set aside for future cleanups, PPG says it
believes its reserves, as well as insurance coverage, can
cover anticipated liabilities.
   So far, only one of the three slag producers has agreed to
clean up chromium-contaminated sites -- some 26 of them, all
in neighboring Kearny and Secaucus. In April, Maxus Energy
Corp., a Dallas petroleum producer formerly called Diamond
Shamrock, agreed to provide up to $51.5 million for cleanup.
Maxus also will pay a $2.5 million fine, the largest
environmental levy New Jersey has ever assessed.
   A third company, Allied-Signal Inc., acquired its
liability. In 1954, Allied bought a closed
chromium-processing plant in Jersey City as part of its
purchase of Mutual Chemical Co. of America. And though Allied
sold the plant just a few months later, the state holds it
responsible for the plant's slag. Allied's cleanup appears
less complicated, though, because 90% to 95% of the slag is
buried at the original dump site.
   PPG isn't as fortunate. Hauling records, PPG receipts of
slag sales and sworn statements from trucking people indicate
that its slag was trucked extensively throughout the city. As
a result, its potential liability could grow. Already, Exxon
Corp. has sued PPG in state Superior Court seeking removal of
chromium from contaminated oil-storage properties in Jersey
City. (The two other companies are also defendants, though
with apparently less exposure.) The Exxon suit in January
follows a similar action, which PPG settled, by Ultramar
Petroleum Inc.
   Such suits could be only the beginning. One Jersey City
law firm's ad in a local paper features a skull and
crossbones and asks "anyone living or working close to
chromium" to join others filing claims. Health officials,
meanwhile, want to conduct clinical studies to determine just
how serious a hazard the slag poses.
   For some Jersey City residents, the hazard is apparent.
Neil Napolitano used to ride his bicycle in a tiny park next
to his house here. But a year ago, state inspectors found
chromium slag buried there, and the city put up a warning
sign. Now, tests show high levels of chromium in the
14-year-old boy's body. For years, he had suffered from
rashes on his elbows, severe headaches and respiratory
ailments, which his doctor now thinks were allergic reactions
to chromium. Since the boy has avoided the park, his health
has improved. But his doctor says he can't say what the
long-term effects may be.
   Adding to local fears is the grisly death two years ago of
a 60-year-old welder who had worked at a truck terminal in
nearby Kearny. A state medical examiner attributed the man's
death partly to chromium poisoning. The septum of the man's
nose, the bridge separating the two nasal passages, had been
eaten away, a condition that was common among chromium
workers as recently as the 1960s. The chromium also
apparently had bored a hole through the roof of the man's
mouth and turned his skull yellow.
   Health concerns have been heightened because the waste is
all over Jersey City. It lies beneath vacant lots fenced off
with "Keep Out" signs. Houses are built on or near it; so are
parks, libraries and warehouses. Last summer, chromium dust
was discovered in the carpeting, duct work and vacuum
cleaners of an elementary school -- and in the children's
blood. PPG, saying the state couldn't prove that any of the
dust at the school came from its slag, has refused to pay the
$251,500 cleanup bill the state sent it.
   Elsewhere in Jersey City, an abandoned discount store sits
near the site of an abandoned drive-in theater. For years,
the area was known as the "yellow lake" because
yellow-stained rain water would pool there and empty into the
Hackensack River.
   "There's about 950,000 tons of chromium sitting there,"
says Mr. McKee, sipping coffee in a nearby diner. To
temporarily prevent slag from moving or blowing about,
plastic tarps have been spread over about half of the 30-acre
site.
   Against this background, Robert Hazen, the state
environmental agency's manager of risk assessment, says
Jersey City chromium could be more serious than the
celebrated Love Canal case. "It's worse because that
situation was mostly PCBs and dioxins and only involved one
spot," he says. The Love Canal solvents haven't been
positively linked to human cancer, but the most hazardous
form of chromium, hexavalent chromium, is known to cause
cancer through inhalation.
   Mr. Hazen also notes that the material in Love Canal
didn't climb walls or form crystals blown about by wind. But
chromium, being water-soluble, doesn't always stay put. It
seeps through concrete, is drawn up cinder-block walls and
slides around like Jello under buildings. Now, many concrete
floors and walls of buildings are buckling throughout Jersey
City.
   The leaching process is more mysterious. Ronald Ross, a
former consultant to the Hudson County Regional Health
Commission, says contamination rates can change drastically
for no apparent reason. At a warehouse once rented by
Leaseway Transportation Corp., for instance, monitoring
initially showed little to worry about. But, when Dr. Ross
rechecked a few months later, chromium "suddenly popped out
all over the place in a couple of areas in the building," he
says.
   Afterward, says Lynn Clark, Leaseway's director of
environmental affairs, the Cleveland-based trucking company
relocated its eight employees because "we were concerned
about their safety," both because of chromium exposure and
because the warehouse's walls became unstable as slag under
its footings shifted.
   PPG's plant on Garfield Avenue was a popular place in
winter during the 1950s and '60s. Its two- and
three-story-tall mounds of green, black and yellow slag
became sledding hills for children when the snow fell.
   But inside the antiquated, turn-of-the-century plant, the
work was hot and dangerous. Orange and yellow dust floated
about. Kilns, heated to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, roasted
chrome ore from South Africa into quarter-inch pellets and
crystals. These products were sold to makers of yellow,
orange and green paints, and to make chrome for auto bumpers
and trim.
   Even then, the dangers of hexavalent chromium were
well-known. Studies dating back decades suggested that the
dust probably caused lung cancer and commonly destroyed
workers' septums.
   Chester J. Milczarek, the plant's manager and chief
chemist from 1957 until 1961, said in a sworn statement in
1987 as part of a Jersey City Redevelopment Authority lawsuit
against PPG that he routinely took air samples because PPG
wanted to prevent such injuries. (PPG lost that suit in
Newark federal court and was ordered to pay the authority
$253,000 to clean up a contaminated site in the city. PPG's
appeal of the judgment failed.)
   One of Mr. Milczarek's technicians had a perforated
septum. Many other employees had "chrome sores," skin ulcers
evidently caused by exposure to chromium. This was especially
true, Mr. Milczarek testified, of workers who didn't wear
gloves; the dust invaded scratches and cuts. The sores almost
always left scars because company nurses, to clean them,
picked off the scabs every day; otherwise, untreated lesions
would spread, Mr. Milczarek testified.
   Mr. Milczarek testified that his own tests of PPG's slag
showed that at least 1% was the known carcinogin, hexavalent
chrome. The company admits to producing about 330,000 tons of
slag.
   By the time he left the plant in 1961, Mr. Milczarek
testified, most of the slag was gone -- sold as landfill for
as little as 10 cents a cubic yard or, in some instances,
given away. Donald Dailey, works manager at the PPG plant
from 1956 until 1964, said in a deposition last year that
people were "so anxious to get {slag} that we didn't have any
trouble getting rid of it.
   "Sometimes it caused so much traffic congestion that we
would have to tell them to slow down for a while," said Mr.
Dailey, whose sworn statement was taken in connection with
Ultramar's suit against PPG. "Anything you got out of it was
gravy and solved the problem of storage." PPG's plant was the
smallest facility of the three in the area, and it simply
didn't have the room to keep the slag.
   The slag was prized because plants rarely would grow in
it, making it a favorite fill for potholes and street
projects. And a newspaper article in the 1950s quoted Jersey
City's public-works director as saying, "We tested it and
found that it killed off rats." The article said he had all
but eliminated rodents at the city's big housing projects
with it.
   PPG's own records, subpoenaed by the state, show that the
company was concerned about the chromium for years after its
plant had been dismantled and the site sold. In 1981, for
example, company officials visited the site and noted the
hexavalent chrome at a truck-turnaround area and along a
railroad embankment. "Runoff from these areas flows to city
storm sewers and into upper New York Bay," the lower Hudson
and North rivers, the PPG memo says.
   Now, some residents say the chromium problem has
practically ruled out any redevelopment in the inner city.
Before fears about the slag spread, some redevelopment had
been going on because Jersey City is just across the Hudson
from lower Manhattan. One suspected PPG slag site is landfill
used in Liberty State Park, a reclaimed area on the Jersey
City waterfront close to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis
Island.
   Only two years ago, Mildred Napolitano, Neil's mother,
says she could have sold their house for $169,000. "Now, it's
worth zip," she says. She says one insurance company has
canceled coverage because of chromium found at the park,
which the state contends was produced by PPG. Mrs.
Napolitano, an employee of the county welfare department,
says she can't afford to buy another house.
   What may be worse, she says, is that friends rarely visit
her anymore out of fear of contamination. "We're living in a
nightmare," she says. "I wish the company that dumped the
chrome here would buy my house so I could move away."

   Rule of Law:
   Two Cheers for This Bill to Reform RICO

   The villagers were happy whenever someone was saved from
the ravages of Dr. Frankenstein's monster, so anything to
limit RICO would help. Of course, when it comes to dangerous
beasts of fiction and fact, it's a good idea to relax only
when the threat is totally destroyed.
   So only some polite applause for a bill announced last
week now working its way through the House. It addresses what
is probably the biggest problem with the Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations law -- to wit, that it was passed
to help prosecutors bring criminal cases against mobsters,
but now is used more than 90% of the time by private parties
suing legitimate businesses and individuals in garden-variety
lawsuits for damages. Triple damages and getting to smear
someone as a "racketeer" makes RICO a favorite among
plaintiffs' lawyers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The reform bill would create a judicial gatekeeper to
block abusive cases between private parties. Federal judges
would have broad discretion to just say no to these civil
RICO cases, especially when there is no criminal aspect to
the case. Most civil RICO cases could go forward only if they
would help deter "the repetition of egregious criminal
conduct."
   The bill would require judges to dismiss cases unless one
of two tests is met. One is that the defendant has already
been criminally convicted under one of RICO's predicate acts,
such as murder or mail fraud. The other -- and here's where
it gets murky -- is that the "significance of the injury"
justifies a RICO case, the defendant was a major participant
and "the remedy is needed to deter future egregious criminal
conduct." Depending on how judges view this provision, it
could knock out all run-of-the-mill contract, negligence,
securities, divorce and labor cases that now masquerade as
RICO.
   Although aimed primarily at limiting civil RICO, the bill
also recognizes that vague wording applies equally to
criminal RICO. The problem was that Congress didn't simply
want to pass a law making it a crime to be a member of the
Mafia. Instead, the crime is a "pattern" of "racketeering"
involving two "predicate acts."
   One reform would limit both the civil and criminal abuses
of RICO by finally defining what pattern means. One of the
bill's backers, Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.), says "no longer
would two phone calls or two letters or one of each in
breaking a contract automatically amount to a RICO case." The
bill instead says RICOable acts must be "related to one
another or to a common external organizing principle," which
"pose a threat of continuing racketeering." Also, it would
count "two or more acts which are part of a single episode"
as a single act.
   If this still sounds like gibberish, it's a big
improvement. In 1985, the Supreme Court said pattern means
"continuity plus relationship." Courts used this
interpretation to limit RICO with metaphysical essays on
"mailings" vs. "episodes" vs. "schemes" and "continuity" vs.
"relationship" vs. "distinctiveness."
   The Supreme Court called off this exercise in divining
Congress's intent with its 1988 case, H. J. Inc. v.
Northwestern Bell Telephone. Justice Antonin Scalia noted
that judicial efforts to define pattern had "produced the
widest and most persistent circuit split on an issue of
federal law in recent memory." He said RICO "is beyond me . .
. it is also beyond the Court." Saying that pattern requires
continuity plus relationship, he said, is as helpful as
saying, "Life is a fountain." A majority of justices have now
agreed that RICO might be unconstitutionally vague.
   RICO has its apologists. Notre Dame law professor Robert
Blakey, who as a congressional staffer helped draft RICO,
recently wrote a law-review article defending the law's
vagueness. "The question is whether Congress should try to
make `pattern' more definite," Dr. Frankenst . . . er, Mr.
Blakey says. He says no, that the meaning of pattern be "left
flexible so it can be used in a variety of situations."
   One person's flexibility is another's civil rights
violation. Almost any definition of pattern would have
prevented the RICOing of Robert Wallach, Edwin Meese's old
friend. He was convicted for mailing two legal bills that
prosecutors said were actually for lobbying -- lobbying that
would have been legal. Even so, two "mail frauds" make a
"pattern" so Mr. Wallach is a racketeer.
   The proposed reform would also decriminalize some
exercises of the right to free speech. The National
Organization for Women has nearly put Operation Rescue out of
business by RICOing its members for picketing abortion
clinics. The bill would exempt nonviolent demonstrations as
racketeering acts. This would still leave open to RICO suits
several defendants whose alleged racketeering was writing or
publishing articles about anti-abortion demonstrations. The
bill would also reduce frivolous claims by requiring
plaintiffs to file pleadings with "particularity" and by
raising their burden of proof.
   The House bill has a fair chance of passage, but would
have to be reconciled with a very different Senate bill. The
Senate's is more limited, but does abolish triple damages in
most civil suits and gives special protection for the much
RICOed securities and commodities industries.
   Meanwhile, as Congress fiddles, comedian and perennial
presidential candidate Pat Paulsen is the latest husband to
be sued as a racketeer by an estranged wife (maybe he'll form
the Dump RICO Party?). We now know that even pets can raise
class-action RICO claims; Ralston Purina has been sued as a
racketeering enterprise for allegedly exaggerating the
virtues of Puppy Chow.
   The proposed RICO reform is hardly perfect. It probably
would not have stopped the coercive RICOing of Drexel Burnham
Lambert, Michael Milken or Princeton/Newport. It wouldn't
prevent pretrial forfeitures of assets. Commodities traders
could still innocently become racketeers. It has no answer
for the federal judge in the RICO case against Imelda Marcos,
who last week asked, "What's an American court, what am I
doing here, trying a case involving the theft of money from
Philippine banks?"
   This reform bill is better than no bill. Still, some day
either Congress or the Supreme Court must conclude that the
only really good RICO is a repealed RICO.

   Art Auction Season Draws to a Close,
   With London Sales Not a Pretty Picture

   LONDON -- The 1989-1990 art auction season ended not with
a bang, but with an uneasy silence.
   The majority of paintings and sculpture for sale this
week, which carried an estimated total value of over $300
million, failed to sell. There was robust, even frantic,
bidding for the highest quality artwork, and for the lovely,
sentimental Impressionist paintings that Japanese collectors
strongly favor. But what wasn't pretty or wasn't very good
failed to find buyers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The summer London sales are crucial for the auction
houses, and for dealers, because they represent the "bread
and butter" sales of midrange paintings and sculpture.
   At Sotheby's Holdings Inc.'s London auction room here last
night, 58% of the artworks were "bought-in," or failed to
sell. The highest price reached was a relatively paltry $3.4
million for Marc Chagall's "Soleil au Cheval Rouge." It was
Sotheby's last major art auction until October.
   The sale was "very despondent," said Lord Gowrie, chairman
of Sotheby's International, the European unit of New
York-based Sotheby's Holdings. He said pre-sale estimates for
works of art had been set perhaps 10%-30% too high,
discouraging potential bidders. He said the company will be
more conservative in the future.
   At Christie's International PLC's auction of Impressionist
and Modern paintings Monday evening, slightly more than half
the works failed to sell. But the brisk demand for the art
that did attract bidders still enabled Christie's to earn
roughly three-quarters of the total dollar amounts it had
expected.
   Overall, collectors and art speculators balked at buying
anything but top-rank art or cut-rate bargains.
   Buying patterns split along well-recognized lines of
quality. Also the brighter colored paintings outperformed the
more difficult or dour, such as a brown-and-gray Vincent van
Gogh that failed to find a buyer at Christie's. In addition,
works by Pierre-Auguste Renior, which have been abundant on
the auction block recently, didn't meet with a good response.
   But bidding was furious for an uncharacteristically
cheerful 1901 Pablo Picasso that featured fresh-faced
children launching sailboats on a pond. Two Japanese buyers
vied against a European collector, bidding the painting up to
$23.5 million, more than double the high end of Christie's
pre-sale estimate of $7 million to $10 million.
   There appeared to be more activity than usual in the
after-sale market, when chastened sellers agree to bargain.
After the auctions, sellers often lower the minimum price
they'll accept in exchange for not having to reclaim an
artwork that's been publicly "burnt" by failure to sell.
   And while speculation was rife earlier in the year that
Japanese dealers and collectors were scared out of the art
market by weakness in the Tokyo stock market, it is instead
the Americans who are on the sidelines. Americans have been
"net sellers, not buyers," said James Roundell, head of the
Impressionist and Modern Paintings department of Christie's
International.
   Only two flagship sales remain. Later this week, both
Sotheby's and Christie's auction contemporary art.
   The Sotheby's sale will be the first in which some objects
of art from the Pierre Matisse Gallery, acquired in a
controversial joint venture by Sotheby's last April, hit the
market.
   Sotheby's paid $142.8 million for the Matisse collection,
fending off charges from some dealers that it was moving out
of the role of disinterested market-maker into the business
of dealing.

   Approval Sought
   For Futures Tied
   To Reinsurance

   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade said it submitted
plans for futures contracts based on auto and health
reinsurance policies to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission for regulatory approval.
   Exchange officials said the proposed contracts were
designed to allow insurers in the U.S. and abroad to hedge
against losses on the policies they write in these areas.
Less risk for insurers could also mean lower insurance costs
for individual policyholders, the exchange said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Insurers currently try to reduce their risk of losses on
outstanding policies by giving a portion of the premium paid
on a policy to a company known as a reinsurer, who in return
shoulders a portion of the risk.
   Insurers, some of whom could see their profit margins
squeezed if the contracts are widely used, haven't rushed to
embrace the proposed contracts, which were unveiled by the
exchange last month. Insurance regulators say they haven't
yet seen details of the contracts, and are taking a
wait-and-see approach before passing judgment.
   Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said, "the
insurance markets represent a huge financial sector that
currently has very limited ways by which to manage its
considerable risk." Premiums for U.S. auto and health
insurance totaled $130 billion in 1987, the last year for
which data are available, said exchange economist Gerg
Samorajski.
   The value of the cash-settled contracts will be based on
the difference between insurance premiums collected and
claims paid on a group of insurance policies over a fixed
time span.
   As the three-month term for each futures contract
concludes, reinsurance certificates will be issued to the
remaining holders of contracts. The certificates will be
redeemed for the net premium earned or lost about four months
later, "when virtually all claims will have been paid," the
exchange said.
   Exchange officials said it may take as long as six months
for approval. A potential launch date for the contracts,
assuming they will be approved, hasn't yet been set.
   Burton Gutterman, an exchange director involved in
developing the contracts, said the exchange's "phones have
been ringing off the hook" with questions from insurance
companies about the proposed contracts. For the next several
months the exchange will be trying to "educate" insurers on
why the contracts would benefit them, he said.
   The Board of Trade said it wants to pick as many insurers
as possible to participate in providing policies to be
included in the insurance pools underlying the contracts. No
company has yet signed up to participate.
   Because insurance companies are regulated at the state
level, most insurers wanting to trade the futures contracts
will have to seek approval from state regulators. Peter
Kelly, Connecticut insurance commissioner, said he had yet to
receive any information on the contracts. The issue came up
at a meeting of state insurance regulators in Baltimore
earlier this month, but none of his compatriots from other
states had any information, either, he said.

   NEW YORK -- A new possible suitor for Ultimate Corp.
emerged as FNIC disclosed that it holds 8.4% of the
computer-systems concern and is considering an acquisition.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in
Washington, FNIC said that its decision hinges on further
study of Ultimate, taking into consideration a poison-pill
anti-takeover measure Ultimate adopted in April.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   FNIC's decision also would take into account factors such
as the availability of financing and the "attitude and
action" of Ultimate's board, the filing said.
   Based in Midvale, Utah, FNIC has operations, investments
and joint ventures in management information services, data
processing, software development, and related technology
companies.
   Ultimate Chairman Michael O'Donnell said there has been no
discussion between the two companies, and Ultimate "hasn't
been contacted" by FNIC.
   FNIC purchased 749,578 Ultimate shares from May 22 to June
4 for $6.50 apiece, all in private transactions. The company
paid for them with notes bearing a 9% interest rate and a
Sept. 30 due date. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, Ultimate's shares rose 50 cents to $7.625.
   Other investors who have indicated interest in acquiring
Ultimate are Norman Elowitz, who runs Honey Fashions, a
women's apparel concern in Manhattan; and Theodore Sabarese,
founder and former chairman of East Hanover, N.J.-based
Ultimate.
   Mr. Elowitz, who was unavailable for comment, recently
raised his holding in Ultimate to 8.42% and reiterated his
desire to acquire the company. In February, Ultimate rebuffed
a $10-a-share, or $95 million, takeover proposal from Mr.
Elowitz.
   Late last month, Mr. Sabarese told the SEC that he didn't
think he'd be able to garner financing for a purchase of
Ultimate. After settling a claim in a personal filing he made
under bankruptcy laws, Mr. Sabarese said he held less than 1%
of Ultimate's shares. Mr. Sabarese couldn't be reached for
comment.
   For the year ended April 30, Ultimate reported net income
of $125,000, or one cent a share, compared with a net loss of
$13 million, or $1.32 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Revenue rose 4.9% to $209.7 million.

   I was very touched by your May 17 page-one article
"Woman's World: Mothers Bear Burden of Poverty as the Men
Drift From Appalachia." Your description of the pride and
problems of Pat Sulfridge and the other women was eloquent
and sensitive. Reading stories like yours can really make
people realize how much we have and how other people have to
struggle every day just to get by.
   We are not rich. I'm an airline mechanic, my wife is a
flight attendant. We both work because we have to. But
compared with Ms. Sulfridge, we are rich. Because of your
article, we are going to try to do more to help other people.

   Your article was so incredibly biased with overt female
chauvinism that it might have been a little strong even for
the now-defunct Ms. magazine. What possessed you to allow
that kind of tripe?
   I canceled my Washington Post subscription after five
years of watching female chauvinism creep off the Style page
onto the editorial page and then the front page. It's
difficult for a lifelong Democrat to say it, but I came to
your paper to find a haven from such sickness. And what do I
find? A page-one article dripping with poorly concealed
hatred for men.
   Where do I go from here? The National Review? And after
that? Pravda, I guess. If I am going to read propaganda in
order to get the news and commentary, it might as well be in
a newspaper where I have to learn a new language.
   I am sincerely disgusted with you -- and all men with no
backbone.

   SAN FRANCISCO -- A state court of appeals refused to
overturn a trial court's judgment that any prospective buyer
of Maxxam Inc.'s Pacific Lumber Co. unit must be notified
that the lumber company is encumbered by pending lawsuits.
   Los Angeles-based Maxxam has interests in aluminum
products, forest products and real estate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The ruling by an appeals court panel here in effect
upholds that of a Superior Court judge in Humboldt County,
Calif., who ruled in May that any interested buyer must be
advised that pending lawsuits challenging Maxxam's 1985
takeover of Pacific Lumber could award the property to
shareholder-plaintiffs.
   That could make it more difficult for Maxxam to sell
Pacific Lumber, or restructure its debt related to the unit's
acquisition. Pacific Lumber, based in Scotia, Calif., is
reportedly trying to restructure its $580 million of junk
bond debt, and negotiate loans from banks and insurance
companies.
   The takeover also became a target of environmentalists
after Maxxam chairman, Houston investor Charles Hurwitz,
doubled the rate of cutting redwoods at Pacific Lumber in
order to service the debt load.
   David Robertson, an attorney for Maxxam, couldn't be
reached for comment on the denial of his appeal.

   Let's Get the Real Story on Israel

   Alexander Cockburn (Viewpoint, op-ed June 14) rejects my
criticism of his representation of events in Israel, accusing
me of "truth-tampering." Let's look at Mr. Cockburn's
statements and sources.
   1. Citing an account on May 18 in the Israeli newspaper
Ha'aretz, Mr. Cockburn wrote that Gush Emunim leader Rabbi
Moshe Levinger was honored at a celebration at the West Bank
town of Elkana by senior Israeli military officials and
Israeli President Chaim Herzog before going to jail for
killing a Palestinian.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I pointed out (Letters to the Editor, June 4) that
Ha'aretz carried no such account of a celebration in Elkana
honoring Rabbi Levinger. The only function of the ceremony in
Elkana was the marking of the 13th anniversary of the
settlement's founding.
   But Mr. Cockburn continued to cite the "report" in the May
18 Ha'aretz: "A substantial part of Gideon Levi's report in
Ha'aretz that day concerned the cordial relations visible at
Elkana between senior {Israeli} officials and Rabbi
Levinger."
   In fact, the six-line passage concerning Rabbi Levinger in
Mr. Levi's 145-line article reported that the mayor of
another Israeli settlement hugged Rabbi Levinger and that two
senior Israeli military officials shook his hand, winked at
him or smiled at him. There was no other reference to Rabbi
Levinger. A handshake, a hug and a wink with a person who was
in attendance among the crowd of 5,000 at the ceremony have
become, according to Mr. Cockburn, a celebration honoring
Rabbi Levinger.
   2. In his follow-up article, Mr. Cockburn wrote that at
the Elkana ceremony President Herzog wore "the symbolic
headwear of chauvinist ultra-right orthodoxy." President
Herzog wore a knitted skullcap, worn by modern religious Jews
throughout Israel and the world, regardless of political
ideology. Avraham Burg, a member of the left-of-center Labor
Party, wears the same headwear.
   3. Mr. Cockburn wrote that President Herzog referred in
his speech to the Palestinians nearby as "foreigners." In
fact, Mr. Herzog referred to a particular passage from
Leviticus, which mandates Jews to treat the "ger" -- the
biblical word for non-Jewish neighbor -- with "love and
respect." Mr. Herzog then added, "I believe that the moral
commitment about the relationship with the "ger" is being
fulfilled in Elkana."
   4. Citing a report in the May 13 Ha'aretz, Mr. Cockburn
wrote that Rabbi Moshe Neriya "enjoin{ed} every Jew `to shoot
Arabs left and right without thinking and without
hesitating.'" I pointed out in my letter that Mr. Cockburn
twisted Rabbi Neriya's statement, in the form of a letter,
into a call for mass murder. Rabbi Neriya actually wrote as
follows:
   "As someone who has tasted the feeling of being under a
rain of heavy rocks, whose life was in danger, of being
killed or {sustaining} severe injury, I know how someone who
defends himself feels. . . . When you are attacked {by
murderers}, it is not the time to think but to shoot right
and left and bring about the dispersal of the murderers who
are upon you . . ."
   In response, Mr. Cockburn again cited the May 13 Ha'aretz
and charged that I had "slyly substitute{d}" the rabbi's
quote with "a more decorous statement."
   The May 13 Ha'aretz story, even though it contains only a
partial excerpt of Rabbi Neriya's letter, shows Mr. Cockburn
to be mistaken. The story specifically quotes from "a
document" written by Rabbi Neriya that, the reporter noted,
was "read to 100 rabbis":
   "This is not the time to think but to shoot right and left
and bring about the dispersal of the murderers who are upon
you. . . . The arrest of Rabbi Levinger -- a public man who
did not come to murder and did not intend to kill -- is a
warning in all of us to get together and defend ourselves to
protest against the Attorney General and the State which tie
our hands and deny us the right of self-defense."
   I called Dan Margolit, author of the Ha'aretz story and
asked him about the Neriya quote. Mr. Margolit told me: "I
wrote that Rabbi Neriya's words came from his letter in which
he said that one should shoot right and left if one is
attacked by rocks and feels endangered." Was this a call for
mass murder, I asked? "Absolutely not -- that's crazy," he
said.
   5. Mr. Cockburn rejects my statement that Israel Shahak
has no more credibility on human-rights violations than
Lyndon LaRouche. Let me cite just several of the many public
declarations by Mr. Shahak in which Mr. Shahak has called
Jews "Nazis" who run "concentration camps" and has declared
that "Israel's policy is similar to Hitler's."
   My central purpose in writing is not to defend Israeli
policies, but to correct the sloppiness in reporting about
Israel, in particular Mr. Cockburn's.

   EC to Design Aid Program
   For Soviets, but Shuns

   DUBLIN -- European Community leaders agreed to design a
major aid program for the Soviet Union.
   Though the agreement at a summit of the 12 heads of the EC
member nations was short on specifics, it set the EC on the
road to another major foreign-policy exercise, atop an
already ambitious program of aid to revision-minded Eastern
European countries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The leaders declined to set any specific levels of aid to
the U.S.S.R., deciding to wait until two detailed studies on
problems in the Soviet economy are completed. The first study
will address short-term financial strains, such as the
growing payments crisis. The second is to try to identify
ways the West can help the Soviets move away from a centrally
planned economy and develop a more efficient and
market-oriented economic infrastructure.
   The vagueness of the EC commitment was viewed as a
disappointment for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
French President Francois Mitterrand. People at the meeting
said Mr. Kohl had suggested that at least $15 billion is
needed for any assistance to the Soviet Union to be
meaningful, though Mr. Kohl denied he had pushed for any
particular level of aid. Moreover, West German officials
pointed out that they hadn't expected a final decision on the
aid program at this meeting. Mr. Kohl said he "couldn't have
expected anything more."
   EC Commission President Jacques Delors, a leading advocate
of an EC role in helping the Soviets, was clearly pleased.
The leaders put the commission in charge of devising
proposals for the aid program, which is to be considered by
EC ministers by autumn. The commission will consult not only
with Western allies but with major international economic
organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund. Mr.
Delors will visit Moscow next month on a previously planned
visit.
   In addition to the EC initiative toward the Soviet Union,
the two-day summit set the dates for two treaty-amending
conferences aimed at strengthening the EC's powers over
economic, monetary and political matters. The leaders took a
range of foreign-policy positions, and, after some debate,
decided to preserve sanctions against South Africa.
   The decision regarding the Soviet Union comes as the Bush
administration agonizes about whether to join in the aid
effort. The EC plans to describe its approach at the economic
summit of the seven industrial powers in Houston next month.
But European leaders made it clear that the EC aid program
would proceed independently of any U.S. or Japanese support.
   "We are sending a clear signal to Houston," said Irish
Prime Minister Charles Haughey, who was chairman of the
summit. "Our statement expresses full support of the economic
and political process of restructuring undertaken by
President {Mikhail} Gorbachev."
   The Dublin agreement is an illustration of how differently
Europeans and Americans view developments in the Soviet
Union. In the U.S., aid to the Soviets has been stymied
partly by objections to Moscow's handling of the Lithuanian
independence movement and to continued Soviet military aid to
Cuba and other Third World dictatorships.
   But in Europe, these worries have been overridden by even
deeper concerns about the stability of a nuclear-armed
superpower that appears to be on the verge of collapse.
Moreover, European countries are trying to pave the way for
German unification by bringing Soviet Union into a closer
economic relationship.
   "We're very ready to consider financial assistance,
provided it is clearly linked to economic reform," British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said.
   The leaders also instructed the EC Commission to study a
plan put forward by Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers to set
up an energy network providing for increased purchases of
Soviet oil and natural gas. This plan, Mr. Lubbers argued,
would further the Europeans' overall goal of helping to
integrate the Soviet Union into the international economy.
   Mrs. Thatcher, Mr. Delors and Mr. Lubbers all warned that
the West could end up wasting its money if it poured cash
into the Soviet Union without insisting on deep-seated
economic changes. Mr. Delors reasoned that mere financial aid
won't help cure long-term structural maladies in the Soviet
economic system, such as a poor distribution network and the
lack of a banking system and a convertible currency.
   Mr. Delors said, "Gorbachev has been there five years, and
so far, the reforms have not produced the results that were
expected."

   MERIDEN, Conn. -- Cenvest Inc. shares lost 21% of their
value as the bank holding company said it expected a
second-quarter net loss, reflecting the addition of $13.2
million to its reserve for possible losses on bad loans.
   Cenvest's directors also omitted the second-quarter
dividend.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company made the additional loan-loss provision after
the Connecticut Banking Department and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. reviewed two of the company's subsidiaries,
Central Bank and First Central Bank.
   Like many Northeast bank companies, Cenvest has been
jarred by a weak real estate market. The company, which had
been paying out 12 cents a share as a quarterly dividend on
its about 3.9 million shares outstanding, also plans to
charge off $4.5 million of loans from its current reserves.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Cenvest's
stock dropped $1.25 to $4.75 a share.
   In the second quarter of 1989, Cenvest earned $865,000, or
22 cents a share. Cenvest said that its primary capital at
March 31 was 8.64% of its assets and it doesn't expect that
figure to change after the addition to loan-loss reserves.
The company complies with the Federal Reserve Board capital
requirement, a spokeswoman said.

   CRAWFORD &amp; Co., an Atlanta-based insurance claims
adjusting concern, said it plans to issue a dividend of one
share of newly issued Class A common stock for each of its
17.7 million common shares outstanding, and to reclassify
existing common shares as Class B stock. The Class A shares
will have substantially the same rights as Class B shares,
except that Class A stock generally won't have any voting
rights. About 70% of the common stock is controlled by James
H. Crawford, founder. Shareholders are scheduled to vote on
the stock dividend at a special meeting July 24, which also
is the date of record for entitlement to the new shares.
Effective in the third quarter, Crawford &amp; Co. intends to pay
a quarterly of 9.5 cents a share on the Class A stock and
eight cents a share on the Class B stock. It has been paying
quarterlies of 16 cents a share. The company said it expects
the Class A shares to trade "at or near parity" with the
Class B stock.

   SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Intelogic Trace Inc., a struggling
computer-service concern controlled by former corporate
raider Asher B. Edelman, said its board has taken the company
off the auction block.
   Intelogic, which had been on the market since late last
year, said the board decided management's "significant
operating improvements" and its plan to buy back debt
"enhance the value of the company above that which could be
realized through sale of the company at this time."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Specifically, Intelogic has been moving actively to reduce
its investments in a risk arbitrage fund controlled by Mr.
Edelman and use the proceeds to buy back some of the $100
million face amount of junk bonds it issued through Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. in 1986.
   So far this year, the company has repurchased nearly $20
million face amount of debt at a hefty 60% discount, said
Clark R. Mandigo, president.
   Intelogic, which was spun off from Datapoint Corp., a
computer networking concern also controlled by Mr. Edelman,
now plans to focus on growing the business internally and
through acquisitions, Mr. Mandigo said. The company said it
retained Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., which had previously been
seeking buyers, to assist it in its acquisition efforts.

   APPEALS JUDGES SPIKE an IRS argument against deducting
home-loan points.
   Prepaid interest, or points, is deductible currently if
paid "in connection with the purchase or improvement" of your
main home; but points paid in refinancing a mortgage must be
deducted over the life of the loan. In 1988, the Tax Court
voted 8-3 to uphold the IRS's denial of a current deduction
to Mr. and Mrs. James R. Huntsman of Stillwater, Minn., who
paid points on a 30-year mortgage to refinance a three-year
purchase loan and an improvement loan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the eighth-circuit appeals court has reversed that
ruling as too narrow an interpretation. Chief Judge Lay says
the couple got the three-year loan as "an integrated step"
toward long-term financing of the purchase; they didn't
refinance just for a lower interest rate. Thus, the new loan
was "in connection with" the purchase, and the $4,440 in
points is deductible currently.
   A student, David B. Clark, in the University of
Minnesota's Tax Law Clinic argued the winning appeal.
                                                                                                       

   DOORS ARE OPENED to pension funds' investments in
real-estate partnerships.
   Exempt entities' income from debt-financed assets
generally is taxable. Pension funds and schools may escape
tax on debt-financed real-estate investments, on certain
conditions; but the rules have inhibited investments in
partnerships, the form preferred by most developers. Now IRS
Notice 90-41 has removed major barriers. Most important, it
tells how the exempt entities can negotiate a preferred
return on an investment without making the income taxable.
   Also, says Alan R. Hollander, a Boston lawyer, the notice
enables the exempt entities to become real-estate partners
without assuming a share of the risks of hazardous wastes,
uninsured personal injury, and like liabilities. "Pension
funds don't want hazardous-waste risk," Hollander says. "That
had held up many partnership deals where the developer would
take the risk, but the IRS said the funds had to remain
liable."
                                                                                                       

   SUMMER READING? This 38-ounce volume will hold down your
beach towel.
   We lied. The House Ways and Means Committee's roundup of
tax-simplification proposals by officials, interest groups,
and public-spirited real people runs only about 1,200 pages,
not 1,300. After digestion, Chairman Rostenkowski (D., Ill.)
plans hearings. Abolition aside, the most popular targets
include minimum taxes, passive-loss rules, pensions, employee
benefits, estate and gift taxes, and a passel of issues for
multinational businesses. Pleas for a flat tax on gross
personal income or a national sales or value-added tax pop up
a lot.
   The Treasury would simplify estimated-tax penalties,
delete shelter registrations, and rework dependency
definitions and many international, benefits, and bankruptcy
provisions. The joint-tax-committee staff focuses on family
issues, nonbusiness interest deductions, pensions, and many
business, foreign and exempt-bond matters. The Ways and Means
staff adds its own suggestions in these and several other
areas.
   Make members of Congress do their own returns, many
citizens demand.
                                                                                                       

   REDUCED PENALTIES for businesses that fail to file Form
W-2 wage or 1099 payment reports on time, or give faulty
data, were enacted last year for concerns that report
correctly by Aug. 1. But Notice 90-45 says the IRS this year
will waive penalties for corrections filed by Oct. 1,
although this later deadline doesn't apply to forms that
weren't filed when due.
                                                                                                       

   THUMBS UP SUMS UP this ruling on IRS summonses by a U.S.
judge in Wichita, Kan.: The IRS may compel 18 taxpayers to
appear in person for audit interviews. The Taxpayer Bill of
Rights doesn't let taxpayers send representatives in their
stead in response to administrative summonses.
                                                                                                       

   JAPAN DISPLACED Britain as the top recipient of
U.S.-source dividends, interest, and other payments to
foreign concerns and nonresident aliens in 1987; it got $4.46
billion. The IRS says the total outflow rose 4% from 1986's
to $22.7 billion.
                                                                                                       

   JOINT EFFORTS can bring us to grips with arm's-length
pricing, the IRS says.
   It has a plan to cope with an arcane, troubling issue for
itself and multinational companies: how to set arm's-length
transfer prices for products one unit sells to a related unit
in another country. Prices determine where the income is
taxed -- raising specters of avoidance for the IRS and of
unfair double taxation for corporations. The huge sums at
stake often provoke long, costly litigation. So the IRS is
about to issue a procedure letting companies seek advance
approval of proposed pricing methods.
   The IRS also would help get approvals from other nations.
IRS official Charles Triplett figures at least 750 companies
-- half U.S., half foreign -- could benefit. Companies like
the idea, but have misgivings about many details in a draft
of the plan. The Tax Executives Institute, representing
company officials, is concerned about the masses of
confidential and economic data that must be submitted; it
also is uncertain about the value of an advance ruling
because of terms that would favor the IRS.
   The IRS's Triplett says some details do need work. He adds
that an objective approach requires trust on both sides.

   MOSCOW -- The Soviet Union is having trouble paying $2
billion in foreign bills but has asked for more Western
credits to help move toward a market economy, Gennady I.
Gerasimov, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, acknowledged.
   "We're experiencing some commercial difficulties now," he
said. "Our perfectly immaculate record on the external market
of always paying our debts is now under question." He
attributed the $2 billion deficit in the current account, or
balance of payments, partly to disruptions from moving away
from central planning.

   Citing the $2.98 billion West German bank credit backed by
Bonn this week, he said, "If we have credits, it will be
easier for us to have economic reform." The Soviet Union's
economic potential should be enough collateral for
large-scale economic credits, he said, though Moscow hasn't
any plans for implementing them.

   Tokyo stock prices rebounded widely in light but healthy
trading, with the Nikkei Index extending midday gains
following active buying by investment trust funds.
   London stocks, meanwhile, ended a choppy session mixed, as
an opening advance ran out of steam.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 447.58 points to
31571.77, posting the first daily gain in four trading days.
The index fell 570.38 points Monday, the biggest daily loss
since April 16.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index
surged another 494.91 points to 32066.68.
   On Tuesday, the index moved narrowly around 31300 points
most of the day, as firm currency and bond markets encouraged
investors to look for bargains after Monday's retrenchment,
traders said.
   High-technology issues led the advancers in the afternoon.
Interest rate-sensitive large-capital shares added moderate
gains because of perceptions their prices neared bottom after
the heavy selling of the past week, observers said.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 400 million
shares, improving from 292.3 million shares Monday. Advancers
outnumbered decliners 655 to 286, while 174 issues were
unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was up 22.33 points, or 0.97%, to 2323.35.
   The second section index rose 23.32 points, or 0.57%, to
4111.58. Volume in the section was estimated at 18.3 million
shares, up from 12.4 million shares Monday.
   Securities companies tried to stir up activity before
today, the first trading day for transaction recorded in
July, by placing buy orders for their own accounts and
intensifying sales efforts, traders said.
   "The point isn't whether or not we expect stock prices to
go up in July. We've got to do something, instead of just
being discouraged" about the market, said a senior trader at
Yamaichi Securities.
   The dealer-led buying won support from individual
investors who were encouraged by the firmness of the yen and
bond prices yesterday morning.
   After rising 200 points within 20 minutes of the open of
trading, the Nikkei Index remained higher. Investment trust
funds, which consistently placed buy orders at lower levels,
also helped prevent the index from falling and made investors
feel secure about buying, traders said.
   New funds are scheduled to begin investing in the stock
market this week, following payment of salary bonuses. But
because an increasing number of trust fund accounts have been
unwound because of the stock market's poor outlook, the
overall effect of new trust funds on the market this month
probably will be "between neutral and positive," said Shin
Tokoi, deputy general manager of stock trading at County
NatWest Securities.
   Although traders said there's little fear that stock
prices will fall below 31000, the traders predict a slow
recovery of the market from its current level.
   Mirroring the lack of market strength, daily trading
volume has remained below 500 million shares for 12
consecutive trading days, the longest such period since
October 1986.
   Securities companies, which have been suffering from a
lack of commission income, are hoping to lift volume by
boosting high-priced issues, which can increase overall
transaction value on smaller volume, traders said.
   Winners yesterday included Kyocera, which advanced 160 yen
to 8330 yen ($1.03 to $53.59). Pioneer Electronic gained 80
yen to 6150 yen, and TDK was up 250 yen to 7050 yen.
   Other gainers were Daifuku, which rose 80 yen to 2800 yen,
and Fuji Photo Film, which rose 110 yen to 4390 yen.
   Construction issues rose, with Kajima gaining 40 yen to
1900 yen, while Ohbayashi added 40 yen to 1610 yen.
   London shares zoomed higher in the early going on a surge
in the stock-index futures market and bullish recommendations
on the brewery sector. But with most institutional investors
already locked into end-of-quarter positions, there was
little significant buying at the upper levels, market
professionals said.
   Even a strong start to Wall Street didn't inspire any
fresh movements, dealers said. "It's a buyers strike," one
dealer said. "We opened firm but died later on a lack of
business."
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index gained
1.3 points to 2399.8, well below the early morning intraday
peak of 2420.1.
   The Financial Times 30-Share Index fell 2.8 points to
1926.6. Volume was a modest 461.2 million shares, up from
379.1 million issues Monday.
   In the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100 Index contract
closed at 2409, slightly better than the 2407 settlement
Monday, but well below the day's peak of 2432. Dealers
expressed surprise over the robust demand for the June
contract, considering it will expire Friday.
   Of the top 100 stocks in terms of market capitalization,
38 finished lower, 53 closed higher, while nine ended
unchanged.
   Among corporate features, brewers ended stronger on a
combination of some buy recommendations, stock shortages, and
because of the positive sentiment prompted by the "Guinness
money" coming back into the market, dealers said.
   The funds investors gained from the sales of Guinness
shares to LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, as part of the
companies' agreement to hold an equal share in the other, are
being re-invested in Guinness and the sector in general,
market professionals said.
   Allied-Lyons rose 4 pence to 510 pence (7 cents to $8.82),
Scottish &amp; Newcastle advanced 3 pence to 340 pence, and
Whitbread gained 8 pence to 451 pence. Against the trend,
Grand Metropolitan fell 12 pence to 660 pence on what traders
said was a "switch" recommendation from Grand Met into
Allied-Lyons.
   Cement and building products maker RMC gained 18 pence to
707 pence, after a bullish buy recommendation from brokerage
Robert Fleming.
   Elsewhere, shares ended higher in Paris, Amsterdam,
Stockholm and Madrid; lower in Frankfurt and Brussels; and
were mixed in Milan and Zurich. South African gold stocks
closed narrowly mixed.
   Also, stocks closed higher in Sydney, Hong Kong and
Singapore, lower in Seoul, Manila and Taipei and mixed in
Wellington.

   REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   Blocking the Schoolhouse Door
</HL>
<DATE>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12
</SO>
<LP>
   Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus called out the National
Guard in 1957 to prevent black children from attending
all-white Central High School. In 1963, George Wallace stood
in the schoolhouse door to block two black students from
enrolling in the school of their choice. Now, in 1990,
Herbert Grover, Wisconsin's Superintendent of Public
Instruction, is openly trying to block a law that will allow
1,000 low-income black children in Milwaukee to use vouchers
to attend a private school of their choice.
   State Rep. Polly Williams, the law's author, says Mr.
Grover "is condemning inner-city kids to a mediocre education
and a bleak future." She says: "He would rather support an
outdated, entrenched system of privilege than let the
sunshine of competition in."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Grover has publicly encouraged a teachers' union
lawsuit to enjoin him from implementing the Williams plan.
And though the law defines his role in certifying eligible
schools as minimal, he insists that participating schools
comply with a blizzard of rules and forms never specified in
the law. Among them are that each school have facilities to
handle every type of learning disability, a requirement that
each individual Milwaukee public school need not meet.
   Only two private schools filled out all the forms. Six
others didn't and Herbert Grover is set to declare them
ineligible next Monday. A judge has granted the Landmark
Center for Civil Rights, the lawyers for Polly Williams, a
hearing tomorrow on its request for an injunction to force
Mr. Grover to certify the schools if they meet all legal
requirements, but not his bureaucratic "diktats".
   Mrs. Williams came by her pro-choice educational views
after years of trying to reform Milwaukee's crumbling public
schools. A single parent and former welfare recipient, she
watched her four children graduate from public schools while
the system's budgets rose and the quality of education
plummeted.
   Starting in September, the plan will allow up to 1,000
children from families with incomes of no more than 175% of
the poverty level to attend private, nonsectarian schools.
For every child involved, the state will pay up to $2,500 in
tuition and subtract that money from its support of Milwaukee
public schools.
   "It really puzzles me that Mr. Grover would try to stop
this plan," says Thais M. Jackson, a Milwaukee single parent.
"He should be concerned about the city's children and if he
was he would not be doing this. It really doesn't make
sense."
   But Brookings Institution scholar John Chubb says the
teaching establishment's opposition makes perfect sense. "If
the Milwaukee plan delivers better results for less than half
the cost of the public schools, it brings the idea of choice
in education front and center," he says. The Williams plan is
a tactical end-run around the public education monopoly's
Maginot Line.
   William Carr, the acting administrator of the private
Urban Day School and a former public-school board member,
says the rules mandated by Mr. Grover would "turn schools
like Urban Day into public schools and defeat the very
purpose of the law." Tuition at Urban Day is $3,300 a year,
but donations allow poor parents to pay only $650 if they
also do volunteer work with the children.
   Urban Day and the other schools that want to accept
voucher students say the parental involvement and discipline
they require is a key ingredient in their success. "We have
to deliver results or the parents will take their kids
somewhere else next year," says Mr. Carr.
   Polly Williams crafted her school choice plan and pushed
it through the Wisconsin legislature with the support of
conservative Governor Tommy Thompson. "White liberals didn't
support us," recalls Mrs. Williams, who was twice the chair
of Jesse Jackson's Wisconsin campaigns. "They care more for
the education lobby than the welfare of Milwaukee children."
   "The public schools are basically just losing interest,"
says Lonzetta Davis, a single parent who wants to send her
six-year-old daughter, Sabrina, to Urban Day. "I refuse to
put up with it. I know a specific place where Sabrina can get
the education she deserves."
   The question is how long Wisconsin Superintendant of
Public Instruction Grover and his reactionary allies will
stand in the schoolhouse door and block Sabrina's way.

   Credit Ratings:
   Standard Chartered
   Debt Ratings Lowered

   LONDON -- Standard Chartered PLC debt was downgraded by
Ibca Ltd., a London-based bank credit-rating agency, another
sign of the tougher times affecting British banks.
   Ibca placed the fifth-largest U.K. banking group on its
rating watch list last March, after Standard Chartered posted
sharply lower pretax profit due to loan-loss provisions.
Yesterday, the rating agency said deterioration since then in
some Standard Chartered activities justified the lowering of
its so-called individual rating to C from B/C.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The C grade on the Ibca scale, which runs from A to E, is
the level at which some downgraded banks have begun to lose
some institutional funds, according to Ibca. The agency says
the C rating indicates a bank has some problems -- usually
with its risk portfolio -- but has the resources to recover.
Ibca also cut Standard Chartered's long-term rating to
A-minus from A, and its short-term rating to A-2 from A-1.
   The bank "is in a bind," said David Andrews, an Ibca
director. The agency added: "Although management is confident
it has the personnel and systems in place to bring recovery,
{the bank} is likely to suffer more setbacks before this
happens."
   Will Manser, a Standard Chartered spokesman, said Ibca
"looked at us comprehensively and they've come to this
judgment. We hope that it is short-term and that the
underlying growth of our businesses will prove this to be the
case."

   Marketing:
   Brand Names Have Cachet in East Bloc

   Store shelves may be bare in many East Bloc countries, but
consumers there know what they like: Sony, Adidas and
Mercedes-Benz.
   Those names ranked high with consumers in a survey of
brand awareness in Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union.
American brands, including Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Pepsi,
ranked high in terms of pure name recognition. But they
lagged in perceived quality, falling below many European and
Japanese brands, according to the survey conducted by Landor
Associates, an image consulting firm based in San Francisco.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To gauge consumer preferences, Landor interviewed 1,500
shoppers, 500 each in the three countries. All were 18 or
older, and lived in urban areas. Consumers were asked which
brands they recognized on a list of 400 trademarks, which
included names from Japan, Western Europe and the U.S.
Shoppers were then asked how highly they regarded those
brands. Combining the familiarity and esteem scores, Landor
then ranked the brands by "image power."
   Eastern Europeans know far fewer brands than the average
American, who is familar with a dizzying 1,800 trade names.
But considering that Eastern Europeans have little first-hand
experience with the brands they cited -- and scant exposure
to advertising -- they're a surprisingly brand-conscious lot,
the survey found. Hungarians proved the most worldly
shoppers, recognizing an average of 250 of the 400 brand
names. Poles were less brand conscious, distinguishing about
175. The average Soviet shopper, however, could pick out only
100.
   Although incomes are skimpy and basic consumer products
scarce, big-ticket items such as autos and electronics topped
the wish lists of East Europe's shoppers. But not just any
cars: Mercedes-Benz ranked among the top 10 brands in all
three countries. "When you have nothing, you dream big
dreams," said Don Casey, president of Landor.
   Or, perhaps you dream of playing soccer. Adidas, the brand
of athletic shoes and sportswear, ranked in the top five of
all three countries. A spokesman for the German company
attributed the powerful showing of Adidas to the simple fact
that the company has done business in those countries for
several decades.
   American companies that managed to penetrate the East Bloc
early also fared relatively well. Although Coke outsells
Pepsi by a margin of 2-to-1 in international markets, the
Pepsi-Cola brand handily outranked Coke in the Soviet Union.
Pepsi was introduced there 16 years ago; Coke is a relative
newcomer to the East Bloc.
   Overall, however, Landor executives expressed surprise at
consumers' strong appreciation of Japanese brands, and dismay
at their relative lack of regard for U.S. goods. In an
international survey conducted by Landor in 1988, consumers
ranked Coke the world's most powerful brand. But the mighty
soft drink ranked 14th in the Soviet Union, 17th in Poland
and a mere 24th in Hungary.
   And while Eastern Europeans found many U.S. brands
familiar, they found few of them illustrious. McDonald's, for
example, was the best-known brand in Hungary, where it
operates three restaurants. But Big Mac ranked No. 40 in
terms of esteem. In the Soviet Union, where a McDonald's
restaurant in Moscow serves as many as 50,000 customers a
day, the company was the 12th best known, but ranked 17th in
terms of esteem.
   "We're still new to these markets," said a McDonald's
spokesman. "We think the quality perception will improve when
more people have a chance to try the product."
   Then again, it is difficult to compare the quality of a
luxury car with a soft drink or a hamburger.
   Marketing consultants and officials of the companies whose
brands were tested found little cause for alarm in the
results, which they shrugged off as pop research. Some
critics questioned the survey's value to marketers, since few
of the consumers questioned could actually recognize the
products they say they admire -- let alone afford them. "If
Mercedes or Jaguar have a great awareness level, that's
good," said Clive Chajet, chairman of Lippincott &amp; Margulies
Inc., a New York image and identity consultant. "But since
they equal years of salary, what's its commercial value?"
   U.S. products fared much better than their Eastern
European competitors -- which were almost entirely absent
from the lists. Aeroflot, the Soviet Airline, did show up in
the rankings, but not without qualifications. Soviet
consumers ranked their airline the nation's best-known brand,
but in esteem ranked it 35. Hungarians found the Soviet skies
even less friendly. They ranked Aeroflot 92 in terms of
recognition, 210 in esteem.

   U.S. Unveils Plan to Save Spotted Owl,
   But Some See Strategy as Short-Sighted

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration announced some steps
designed to preserve the endangered northern spotted owl, but
it put off issuing its promised long-term strategy for saving
the bird without seriously damaging the timber industry.
   The administration said its plan would cost 1,000 logging
jobs in the Pacific Northwest. But environmentalists
contended it would allow so much logging in the next two
years that little room would be left to carry out any
long-term plan ultimately agreed upon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is the most short-sighted approach to saving the owl
and saving the timber industry that the White House could
come up with," said Rindy O'Brien, chief lobbyist for the
Wilderness Society.
   In announcing the forest-management steps, administration
officials also said they support pending legislation that
would ban the export of raw logs from state lands. The Forest
Service estimates that the change would save about 6,000
sawmill jobs in the Pacific Northwest by the year 2000.
   In addition, the administration said it will ask Congress
to expand the role of a cabinet-level committee that rules on
whether proposed timber sales would jeopardize an endangered
species. Under the administration's plan, the panel also
would be allowed to develop long-term forest-management
plans. Environmentalists objected strenuously to this
proposal, saying, among other things, that it would
politicize the forestry decisions.
   The administration also plans to seek legislation that
would allow it to carry out the spotted owl forest-management
plans without being subject to court challenge.
   On Friday, the administration declared the owl threatened
and put it under the protection of the Endangered Species
Act. That decision brought dismay to the industry, but timber
groups were more hopeful after yesterday's announcement.
   "It is encouraging that the federal agencies are
responding to President Bush's call for balance as it applies
to protecting northern spotted owls and timber families,"
said Mark Rey, executive director of the American Forest
Resource Alliance, an industry group.
   Under the administration's plan, there will be little, if
any, change in the amount of logging on federal lands in the
Pacific Northwest for the current fiscal year, which ends
Sept. 30. In the following year, logging on Interior
Department land will be reduced to 750 million-to-800 million
board feet from about 950 million board feet this year. The
plan was outlined by Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan.
   Mr. Lujan said the steps would save 450 pairs of owls, 125
more than under a plan proposed by an inter-agency scientific
panel last spring. There are about 2,000 pairs of owls left,
mostly in old-growth forests in Oregon and Washington.
   The 1,000 jobs to be lost as a result of the
administration's plan compares with 7,600 under the earlier
proposal. Environmentalists, however, contend that the
reduced employment loss would be achieved only because the
administration would allow excessive cutting in areas that
aren't designated as spotted owl habitats.
   The Agriculture Department, which controls land accounting
for 75% of the annual timber harvest, hasn't presented its
plan for future fiscal years. The administration is setting
up an inter-agency task force to devise a forest management
plan for fiscal 1991 that it says will be designed to protect
the owl while mitigating economic dislocation. The panel,
which will be headed by Mr. Yeutter and will consult with
lawmakers and governors from affected states, will complete
its work by Sept. 1 so that any legislative changes
recommended can be acted upon in the current congressional
session.
   "The administration is deeply concerned both about
endangered species and the livelihood of families in the
Pacific Northwest who depend on timber production," Mr.
Yeutter told reporters.

<LP>
   We wonder: How many Supreme Court justices can dance on
the head of a pin?
   Reading the Supreme Court's right-to-die decision and its
two abortion decisions Monday, it is not clear to us that the
individual members of a society are going to be better served
now that judges have replaced angels atop humankind's
touchiest moral problems. Let's set aside for now the
question of whether the Court was right that an individual
can refuse medical treatment but that Nancy Cruzan's
"somewhat serious conversation with a housemate friend"
didn't meet Missouri's "heightened evidentiary requirements";
or that an abortion law with parental notification is
constitutional if the minor can talk to a judge as an
alternative.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We are more struck by the fact that the Supreme Court and
courts generally have become the institution to which so many
people now turn for guidance on problems of conscience and
morality.
   Several years ago, we sat in a federal courtroom on Long
Island and watched an appeals-court judge listen to lawyers
litigate one of the Baby Doe cases. The judge heard about
medicine, the rights of infants, the duties of parents and
the obligations of society. At last the judge said that like
other cases now, this one was quite beyond the law's skills
or precedents but that the litigants, their supporters and
the media had gathered on this occasion and wanted him to
somehow figure it all out and render a decision. So he did.
Indeed one of the best right-to-die decisions we've read was
by a New Jersey state judge who just wrote out some sensible,
personal thoughts on the subject.
   Courts have assumed this function partly by volition but
partly by default. Courtrooms have become the last refuge of
a society that has gradually lost faith in the ability of the
institutions that used to provide a coherent framework within
which an individual could form moral or ethical opinions and
reach conclusions.
   As the 2 Live Crew and NEA controversy indicates, the
contemporary moral philosophy of many intellectual leaders
is, anything goes. They are little help. Over the last 15
years, the established Christian churches have abdicated
their authority in the area of individual moral
responsibility, choosing instead to promote "social-justice
issues," which make the churches mainly an adjunct to secular
politics and sociology.
   Few reporters bothered to call a minister or priest for
comment on the right-to-die case. They quite sensibly called
the groups who now do what thinking exists on these personal
questions, such as the United Handicapped Federation or
Concern for the Dying. Indeed as we've argued before, some of
these movements and groups, like the Sierra Club or Friends
of Animals, now give their members the purposefulness once
provided by the churches. But there is an important
difference: Where the churches relied heavily on personal
conscience, their successors rely on the courts.
   "There are some wonderful things here," the director of
legal services for the Society for the Right to Die said of
the Missouri decision. "The Constitution is being applied in
a brand new and revolutionary way."
   We don't see how it can be regarded as good to have the
U.S. Constitution transformed into Holy Writ and judges
serving as confessors for a morally perplexed society.
Justice Scalia pointedly warned in his concurrence that if
the Court insisted on injecting itself into every field of
human activity where irrationality and oppression may
theoretically occur, "it will destroy itself."
   There is no denying that advances in areas such as
medicine have made judgment in some painful circumstances
seem more difficult. Up to a point, legislatures reflecting a
publicly debated consensus have to set some rules. We do not
see, though, how an advanced society is going to maintain its
sense of what is morally right or wrong if it becomes wholly
dependent on courts whose own source of inspiration, as here,
is Twin City Bank v. Nebeker (1897).

   Tucson Electric
   Appoints Bayless
   President, Chief

   TUCSON, Ariz. -- Tucson Electric Power Co. said Charles E.
Bayless was named president and chief executive officer of
the troubled utility, effective next Sunday, and announced
the placement of $96 million of first-mortgage bonds in a
major step toward its financial restructuring.
   Mr. Bayless, 47 years old, succeeds Thomas C. Weir, 56,
who assumed the top job in July 1989. Mr. Weir will remain on
the board and will help oversee the liquidation of the
company's investment subsidiary assets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bayless joined Tucson Electric as senior vice
president and chief financial officer in December 1989, and
has been deeply involved in the utility's refinancing
efforts. He previously had served as chief financial officer
of Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, the first major
utility in 50 years to seek bankruptcy-law protection, and
holds degrees in electrical engineering, business and law.
   In an interview, Mr. Bayless said the private placement of
$96 million of first-mortgage bonds with institutional
investors will help the utility focus on firming up its
short-term credit lines and seeking higher revenue through
rate increases and the wholesale power markets. The company's
subsidiaries have sold off about $180 million in marketable
securities in recent weeks, he added.
   The company will meet with bankers later this week to
begin negotiating an anticipated $300 million credit facility
that "should give us the financing to go for several years,"
Mr. Bayless said. In addition, the utility plans to submit a
regulatory request for an estimated 10% rate increase in
August.
   The mortgage bonds, placed through PaineWebber Inc., carry
an interest rate of 12.22% and mature in 2000. Proceeds will
be used for construction and working capital.
   Last month, Tucson Electric officials had raised the
possibility of a bankruptcy filing if various financing plans
were unsuccessful. In 1989, the company reported a loss of
$82.1 million, or $3.55 a share, on revenue of $593.7
million.
   Mr. Weir and John P. Schaefer, the company's chairman,
were thrust into those posts last year following the abrupt
resignation of Einar Greve, the utility's top executive, amid
a barrage of bad news. The company has been plagued by excess
generating capacity throughout the Southwest as well as ill
effects from its diversification into areas including thrifts
and real estate.
   Edward J. Tirello Jr., an analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., called Mr. Bayless's appointment a "very prudent
move," because of his financial background and his experience
with the troubled New Hampshire utility. Mr. Tirello said the
company probably will have to request additional rate boosts
of 5% to 6% a year over the next few years. He expects the
company to report a loss of perhaps $2 to $3 a share for the
year, and an additional loss for 1991.
   The company's shares closed yesterday at $11.375, up 25
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   House Panel Clears
   Bill Restricting Use
   Of RICO in Suits

   WASHINGTON -- A House Judiciary subcommittee unanimously
approved legislation that would restrict use of the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in
lawsuits. But prospects for the bill's enactment are cloudy.
   The current law, known as RICO, grants triple damages to
victims of civil fraud. For years, business groups have been
lobbying for a change in the law, arguing that it was
intended to apply only to organized crime. But
public-interest advocates have argued against altering the
law, saying it is an effective weapon against fraud by
savings-and-loan associations and other white-collar
businesses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Offered as a compromise by crime subcommittee chairman
Rep. Bill Hughes (D., N.J.), Rep. Bill McCollum (R., Fla.)
and Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.), the measure approved
yesterday is more moderate than a version approved by the
Senate Judiciary committee in February. Rep. Hughes called it
a "vast improvement on what Congress has passed in the past."
   Under the House bill, federal courts would act as
"gatekeepers" for the RICO law, allowing its use only if
certain conditions are met. For example, the court would need
to determine whether the case involves "egregious criminal
conduct" for which there has been a previous criminal
conviction. If not, the law couldn't be applied unless the
court determined that the case was of unusual magnitude or
significance. The bill also would impose a stiffer burden of
proof in RICO cases than is the norm in most civil cases.
   Arguing that the bill shouldn't let people who defraud
savings and loans off the hook, Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.)
introduced an amendment to maintain existing RICO penalties
for pending and future S&amp;L cases. "We're talking the biggest
scandal in American history," he said. But he voluntarily
withdrew the amendment after other committee members
questioned its constitutionality. Rep. Conyers also
introduced an amendment to exempt current lawsuits from the
change. The measure failed on a 4-6 vote.
   Rep. Conyers, who voted to approve the bill, said he will
reintroduce his savings-and-loan amendment when the bill
comes before the full Judiciary Committee.
   Floor action on the Senate bill, which differs
significantly from the House version, isn't expected soon. A
spokesman for the bill's Senate sponsor, Sen. Dennis
DeConcini (D., Ariz.) said he didn't know whether Sen.
DeConcini would support the gatekeeper compromise.
   Sen. DeConcini initially received criticism for his
version of the bill because it granted RICO relief in current
lawsuits, including those against Charles Keating, chairman
of the former parent of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association.
Mr. Keating's ties to Sen. DeConcini are the subject of a
Senate ethics investigation. Sen. DeConcini subsequently
modified his position, calling for RICO relief only in future
lawsuits. The Senate Judiciary Committee included this change
in its version of the bill.
   Unlike the House version, however, the Senate RICO bill
wouldn't give the courts the power to grant triple damages.
Instead, such damages would be eliminated in all but a few
instances.

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration for the first time
urged Congress to allow telephone companies to provide
cable-television service.
   In a letter to key lawmakers, the administration also said
it strongly opposes cable-television reregulation. Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher and James Rill, head of the
Justice Department's antitrust division, said the
administration is "particularly concerned" about regulation
of rates for a basic tier of service consisting of broadcast
stations and requirements that cable companies sell their
programming to competitors such as direct broadcast satellite
services.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In letters to House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman
John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.),
chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee,
Messrs. Mosbacher and Rill said the administration is also
concerned that the cable measures don't do much to remove
barriers that make it difficult for new competitors to enter
the cable business. The two suggested that Congress should
lift the ban contained in the 1984 Cable Act.
   The letters were sent yesterday, a day before Mr. Markey's
subcommittee is scheduled to mark up a bill to regulate basic
cable rates and stimulate competition to monopoly cable
operators. While the letters give support to phone companies,
their effect on legislation is unclear. With so little time
left on the congressional calendar, Congress is unlikely to
pass any legislation allowing phone companies to enter the
cable business this year.
   Meantime, Sen. Conrad Burns (R., Mont.) is expected this
week to introduce a bill that would allow independent
telephone companies to enter the cable business within their
service territories.
   The measure, offered as an amendment to the cable bill
that passed the Senate Commerce Committee earlier this month,
wouldn't do much to help the regional Bell companies, which
are barred from providing cable and other information
services under the consent decree that broke up the Bell
system.

   CareerCom Corp., blaming a sharp decline in its
truck-driver school enrollments, said it expects to report a
loss for the third quarter ending Saturday, June 30, and for
the second half ending Sept. 30.
   The anticipated losses weren't quantified. For the three
months ended June 30, 1989, the company reported net income
of $300,518, or three cents a share, on revenue of $36.1
million. For the 1989 fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, the net
loss was $8.1 million, or 79 cents a share, resulting in a
loss for the full year of $7.5 million.

   CareerCom of Lemoyne, Pa., an operator of various training
institutes, has been unpopular with investors in recent years
because of its erratic performance. Last year's results
included pretax charges of more than $12 million related to
buy-outs of employment contracts and stock of several
officers and directors.
   CareerCom said the truck-driver school enrollment decline
was linked to federal funding cutbacks that took effect in
January. In recent weeks, however, the company said
enrollments have rebounded somewhat, raising the prospect
that earnings performance might improve.

   Unisys, Struggling With Big Debt Load,
   Sells Preferred Stock to Japanese Firm

   Unisys Corp., struggling with a heavy debt load, said it
sold $150 million of preferred stock to Mitsui &amp; Co. of Japan
that can be converted into 4.6% of Unisys's common stock
outstanding.
   Unisys, a maker of computer equipment and defense
electronics, also arranged a $50 million, five-year loan from
the huge Japanese trading company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Japanese investments in U.S. computer companies have
sometimes been controversial, and, in some cases, barred by
the U.S. government on the grounds that the technology is
crucial for national security. But Unisys, Blue Bell, Pa.,
played down the significance of the investment, noting that
Mitsui can't increase its stake.
   Unisys also said it was natural to turn to Mitsui for
financing, given that the two companies have worked together
for decades. The companies each own one-third of Nihon Unisys
Ltd., a computer marketer that does about $2 billion of
business each year in Japan. And Sperry Corp., which merged
with Burroughs Corp. four years ago to form Unisys, began
working with Mitsui in the late 1950s.
   Unisys has made little progress thus far on its stated
plan to cut debt by $600 million to $800 million this year,
from about $4 billion, or 50% of total capitalization, at the
end of last year. The Mitsui arrangement, however, doesn't
seem to indicate that the Unisys plan has run into problems.
It simply means that the debt reductions, mainly through the
sale of real estate, will occur in the second half.
   Investors took the Mitsui arrangement in stride. Unisys
stock closed at $13.125, down only 50 cents, in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The more worrisome problems are all long term. Unisys ran
into difficulties in late 1988 as inventories swelled and
orders in the U.S. slowed. Although its momentum had been
impressive to that point, it wound up reporting a $639
million loss for 1989, including a $230 million charge
related to an 8% reduction in its work force. Unisys followed
that with a loss of $3.1 million, or 19 cents a share, in the
1990 first quarter and securities analysts expect it to only
break even in the current second quarter.
   Analysts generally predict that Unisys will do much better
in the second half, as it gets its debt under control and as
it gets the full benefits of last year's job cuts. So,
earnings estimates range from $1 to $2 a share for all of
1990. But many analysts are wary about counting on such a
sharp upturn, especially because there haven't yet been signs
that Unisys's U.S. business is turning around.

   Economic Plan

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush is expected to lay out new
Latin American economic policies that emphasize helping the
region cope with its heavy debt to foreign governments and
attract more outside investment, administration officials
said.
   The president is set to announce the policies as early as
today, the officials said. In recent days, the Treasury's
undersecretary for international affairs, David Mulford, has
briefed Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills and other senior administration officials on the new
Latin American approach, administration officials said.
Spokespersons for the White House and Treasury declined to
comment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With substantial White House involvement, the new Latin
American policy was developed in the administration's
interagency process over the past several months.
Administration officials said they regard the new measures as
a supplement to Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's debt
strategy, which thus far hasn't matched the expectations that
it first aroused.
   That strategy put a greater emphasis on offering heavily
indebted nations, mainly in Latin America, some relief on
their foreign bank debt. Mexico, the Philippines and Costa
Rica have negotiated agreements under the new strategy, and
Venezuela is in the process of doing so.
   Any administration efforts to help the Latin Americans
address their debts owed to foreign governments will be
particularly welcome in Congress. The U.S. is generally the
largest government creditor to Latin American countries. The
House Banking Committee agreed to urge the White House to
work through the Paris Club of western creditor governments
to provide more official debt relief to nations in Eastern
Europe, Latin America and Africa.
   The Bush administration is eager to try to do more for
Latin America, which has generally had little or no economic
growth over the past several years. There is a widespread
feeling at the top of the administration that now is the time
to offer Latin America more technical aid and other
relatively inexpensive forms of help, as well as to try to
help the region entice foreign investment capital.
   President Bush plans to visit Brazil, Argentina and Chile
in September. Advisers said he is particularly eager to
ensure that Latin America is able to prosper economically,
particularly as many nations in the area -- including
Argentina, Brazil and Chile -- have only recently returned to
democracy. Senior administration officials, also said they
are eager to ensure that Latin America isn't neglected,
especially when so much attention has been focused on Eastern
Europe over the past several months.
   Other cabinet members also have been visiting the region
recently. Mr. Mosbacher just returned from a week-long trip
to Latin America, and Mrs. Hills last month addressed the
Organization of American States annual meeting in Asuncion,
Paraguay, and visited Argentina and Brazil. Secretary of
State James Baker and other cabinet members will visit Mexico
this August for an annual bilateral cabinet gathering.

   NEW YORK -- At long last, the mark benefited from
anticipation of German monetary union this Sunday. After
trying to talk up the mark for weeks, foreign-exchange
dealers began to buy up marks yesterday, breathing new life
into the West German currency and smothering the dollar.
   "A lot of people have been bullish on Europe and the mark
for some time, and the market just decided to stand out of
the way and and let it go up," said David Wilson, a New York
vice president with Girozentrale Vienna.

   The Canadian dollar appreciated along with other
non-dollar currencies. The announcement that two members of
parliament from Quebec would quit the ruling Conservative
Party over the failure of the Meech Lake accord and sit
instead as independents was generally ignored by the
foreign-exchange market, said William Orsini, senior manager
for treasury markets with Bank of Montreal.
   The U.S. dollar ended in New York at 1.1712 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1773 Canadian dollars Monday.
   The mark's rise was by no means a sharp one. But traders
saw significance in way the West German currency took control
of the day's foreign-exchange market, seizing a dominance
analysts have been predicting for it ever since the formation
of a greater Germany became a certainty around the turn of
the year.
   The market ascribed less importance to the direction the
mark moved. Participants were uncertain whether the mark's
gain yesterday was a thin session's fluke or the start of a
bullish trend.
   "All this is surprising in the runup to German monetary
union, when we could have expected a softer Deutsche mark,"
said Andy Robertson, Chase Manhattan's corporate
foreign-exchange sales manager. "It's too early to tell if
this is the longterm direction."
   "We're currently operating in a vacuum," Mr. Robertson
said, noting that this week is the last in the month and
quarter, normally a down time for economic indicators and
customer orders.
   In addition, market participants still want to study the
consequences of shipping and wiring 25 billion marks,
according to one estimate, into East Germany in the next few
weeks. They also are awaiting the start on Monday of the
Soviet Communist Party conference and the U.S.'s credit
policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
   Both get-togethers are expected to see some lively debate.
Communist Party hard-liners will attempt to snatch off Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's second hat as Party General
Secretary. Federal Reserve Governor Martha Seger has signaled
her intention to push for easier U.S. credit terms.
   The mark's gains were registered in an atmosphere of
dollar weakness and encouraged selling of the U.S. unit
against other currencies, including the feeble yen.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6630 marks, well below 1.6770 marks late Monday in New
York. The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 154.67
yen, down from 155.35 yen in New York late Monday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted
at 154.35 yen; it closed Tuesday in Tokyo at 155.23 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6642
marks, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.6814 marks.
   Market concerns Tuesday that U.S. interest rates are
heading lower were sparked by comments by President Bush.
Emerging from meetings with congressional leaders on the
federal budget deficit, Mr. Bush backed off of his
"read-my-lips" election campaign pledge for no new taxes and
said he would consider "tax revenue increases."
   The currency market at first responded favorably to the
news, but upon mulling the comment over decided that, in the
short- to medium-term, a real presidential change of heart on
higher taxes will likely mean lower U.S. interest rates.
   About two weeks ago, responding to political pressure for
easier credit, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan promised that
interest rates would fall "very significantly" were a
credible federal budget deficit reduction accord reached.
   The prospect of easier credit undercut the U.S. currency
the most against the strong West German unit, because lower
U.S. interest rates would swing the relative currency-yield
advantage to the mark, said Bill English, senior trader for
Banca Nazionale Dell Agricoltura.
   The Fed committee would probably wait for the July 6
release of June employment data before acting on rates.
   Mr. Bush's comment pushed the dollar to 1.6730 marks,
where preset sell orders pushed the dollar easily through
weak support at 1.6700 marks. The greenback bounced back at
1.6650 marks but later fell further.
   The dollar's weakness allowed an otherwise soft yen to
regain some ground on it. After remaining steady most of the
day against the Japanese currency in the face of declines
against other major currencies, the U.S. unit was finally
pushed off the 155-yen plateau during the early New York
afternoon, and its yen price declined until the end of the
global day.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery dropped $3.40 to settle at $350.40 an ounce.
Estimated volume was a light 2.5 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $350.10 an
ounce.

   Continental
   Bank Sees Loss
   For 2nd Quarter
   ---
   Firm Cites Pretax Charge
   Of $50 Million to Cover
   Job Cuts, Retrenchment

   CHICAGO -- Continental Bank Corp. said it will post a
second quarter loss, mostly due to a $50 million pretax
charge to cover the costs of cutting 900 jobs and retreating
from some businesses.
   The move reflects relatively weak demand for loans and
other services at nearly all big commercial banks, and also
is a setback for Continental's efforts to fully recover from
its 1984 collapse and federal bailout. Over the past three
years, Continental has shunned consumer banking and instead
pursued an all-business-banking plan, but has found those
markets are fiercely competitive and, in places, not very
profitable.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Continental stock fell 62.5 cents on the news to close at
$15.375.
   About 60% of the job cuts will come in the so-called
trading and distribution business, an area Continental began
building aggressively about two years ago by hiring officers
away from competitors at top dollar. Some of that hiring,
Thomas C. Theobald, Continental's chairman and chief
executive officer, conceded, "was a wrong use of resources."
   Continental has done particularly poorly in trading for
its own account in foreign exchange and other markets and in
clearing and executing trades in financial contracts such as
futures and options for customers, Mr. Theobald said. The
hiring in trading and distribution has worked out well, on
the other hand, in selling so-called interest-rate risk
management services, and in selling customers' loans and
other debt to other investors, he said.
   Mr. Theobald said the second quarter loss would also
include the cost of selling some municipal and Treasury bonds
now worth less than the banking concern paid for them. He
wouldn't disclose the amount of the expected loss for the
quarter, or the loss taken during the quarter by selling
bonds. At March 31, Continental's investment portfolio of
about $2.3 billion was valued at $69 million less than its
cost.
   In last year's second quarter, Continental profit was
$64.1 million, or $1.01 a share, and included a $7 million
gain from the sale of real estate.
   Even without the charge and the bond losses, the second
quarter wouldn't have been a good one, Mr. Theobald said,
though he wouldn't disclose expected operating profit. "We're
making money," he said, "but not at a satisfactory rate."
   The staff cuts will save $25 million during the second
half of 1990, Continental said, and about $75 million a year
in future years. If revenue holds up at current levels, Mr.
Theobald said the cost cuts should be enough to get the
company to its profit goals, including 15% return on equity.
   The staff cuts, from a March 31 level of 6,720, will also
include some so-called back office workers, some lending
officials and others.

   About 900 clerical, field and plant workers who walked out
June 7 may return to their jobs as early as Sunday morning,
the utility said. The new contract includes a pay rise of
3.5% for 1990, which is retroactive to February for plant
workers and to May for clerical workers, and increases of
3.6% in 1991, of 3.75% in 1992 and 4% in 1993. The contract
dispute focused on salary, overtime and medical benefits.

   Stamford Capital's
   Boutique Unit
   Is Scaling Back

CORPORATE PROFILE (PRO)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- A promising investment-banking boutique led by
Lehman Brothers alumni has received a rude awakening to the
new order on Wall Street.
   Stamford Co., stung by a corporate-finance slowdown and
heavy trading losses, has scaled back its operations amid the
departure of several pivotal executives. The Stamford Capital
Group Inc. unit, created by Sheldon S. Gordon, former vice
chairman at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., has cut its staff
18% this year, and recently pared its new products and
trading operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "To tell you the truth, {the securities industry} is as
slow as I've seen it since I've been in the business," says
Mr. Gordon, Stamford's chairman, who started his career on
Wall Street in 1959.
   Stamford's experience underscores the difficulties Wall
Street's investment boutiques face these days. These
boutiques, many of them launched by top deal makers to focus
on small niches, have been hammered hard by the slump in
investment banking. Merger activity has fallen to its lowest
level in seven years, and deals that had been expected to
close within three months are taking nine months and more,
bankers say.
   Just last week, Coniston Partners, one of Wall Street's
best-known boutiques, reined in its investment operations
sharply, and other small investment firms are believed to be
on the rocks.
   Stamford Co., launched last year, is modeled after Wall
Street's traditional investment banking partnerships. Its
core partners, including James Boshart, president, and David
Stein, head of corporate finance, are all former executives
of Lehman Brothers, which was bought by Shearson Lehman in
1984. Stamford focuses on so-called middle market companies
involving transactions valued at between $15 million and $150
million. Stamford also manages about $500 million in investor
assets.
   But the firm recently has run into increased competition
from bigger securities firms that earlier shunned middle
market transactions. With so few deals around, the big firms
are devouring whatever deals they can, including many smaller
ones, Mr. Gordon says.
   At the same time, two top Stamford executives recently
jumped ship. Steven Kohlhagen, head of asset management, left
for AIG Financial Products, and John Brennan, chief
administrative officer, is launching a law practice in
Philadelphia.
   Earlier this year, three top traders also departed in the
wake of heavy losses from the October 1989 stock-market
slide. Stamford had trading losses of about $10 million in
the fourth quarter, largely stemming from the slide in UAL
Corp. shares.
   As a result, Stamford has sharply cut back its trading. It
commits just $10 million of its approximately $70 million of
capital in trading, down from as much as $35 million several
months ago. It has halved its trading staff and slashed its
new products development.
   Stamford has a staff of 70, down from its high of 85.
Before the prolonged corporate-finance slump, executives
planned to enlarge the firm to about 125. But Mr. Gordon says
now that he believes the securities industry's problems won't
be over for as long as four years.
   Stamford made a splash last year when it hired a group of
Shearson Lehman investment bankers and worked out a joint
venture in which each firm will receive revenue from certain
transactions involving mid-sized companies.
   Not all recent executive changes at Stamford have involved
departures. The firm recently hired Thomas Pickens as a
principal from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Mr. Pickens will build up
the firm's effort in the $200 billion private-placement
market.

   Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Corp.'s fiscal second-quarter net

35% increase in revenue.
   In the year-ago period, the home builder and commercial
real estate developer posted net income of $20 million, or 57
cents a share. The latest quarter, ended May 31, includes a
$300,000 gain from the sale of land, compared with $5.5
million a year ago.

<TEXT>
   Excluding the effect of land sales, the company said in
Los Angeles that its second-quarter net would have dropped
10%. Revenue in the latest quarter rose to $349.8 million
from $260 million.
   The profit decline reflected lower profit margins in
California's weakened housing environment, partially offset
by strong revenue and earnings contributions from the
company's French commercial and residential development
activities in the Paris area, said Bruce Karatz, president
and chief executive officer.
   For the six months, net income fell 10% to $28.5 million,
or 86 cents a share, from $31.5 million, or 98 cents a share.
Revenue climbed 49% to $665.8 million from $445.9 million.

   Avon Ends Talks
   To Hire Consultant
   Linked to Investors

   NEW YORK -- Avon Products Inc. ended negotiations with
John P. Rochon, a member of Avon's largest shareholder group
whom Avon previously agreed to hire as a consultant to
explore ways of boosting its stock price.
   The talks broke down over the proposed terms of Mr.
Rochon's consulting contract, including Avon's insistence
that Mr. Rochon report to Avon Chairman James Preston rather
than to a special committee of Avon's board, a spokesman for
Mr. Rochon said. Avon and Mr. Rochon hadn't even begun
discussing how much Mr. Rochon would be paid because Avon
insisted that other terms of the contract be resolved first.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An Avon spokesman contended that the main issue for Avon
was its demand that Mr. Rochon sever all of his ties to Mary
Kay Corp., a cosmetics company of which Mr. Rochon is vice
chairman. "Avon's management and board concluded that it is
not appropriate to share confidential and proprietary
financial and operating information with an employee of a
competitor," the Avon spokesman said.
   The breakdown in talks between Avon and Mr. Rochon makes
it less likely that Avon will be sold or restructured anytime
soon, several takeover-stock traders said. Avon's tough
negotiating stance with Mr. Rochon also indicates that
because of the tight market for takeover financing, Avon
isn't particularly worried that its dissident shareholders
will mount a hostile bid, traders and investment bankers
said.
   Avon closed at $35.125, down 12.5 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday.
   In March, Avon had agreed to hire Mr. Rochon as part of a
settlement of a proxy fight mounted by Chartwell Associates,
an investment group that owns a 16.6% stake in Avon.
Investors in Chartwell include the Fisher real estate family
of New York, oil heir Gordon P. Getty, Mary Kay Corp., and
Mr. Rochon. As part of the settlement, Avon agreed to
nominate two Chartwell representatives to its board and to
name a special board committee to explore ways of increasing
shareholder value.
   Richard L. Fisher, a managing partner of Chartwell, said
Chartwell is "very disappointed in Avon's actions. We believe
that if the special committee is to fulfill its mandate, the
committee must have as its consultant an independent expert
who is not affiliated with Avon." Mr. Fisher said Chartwell
"will continue to pursue vigorously our objective of
maximizing shareholder value."
   In addition to Chartwell, major investors in Avon include
a partnership of Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs and Amway
Corp., which owns a 9.8% stake, and the Robert M. Bass Group
of Fort Worth, Texas, which owns a 6.2% stake.
   Avon had proposed that Mr. Rochon sign a one-year
consulting contract and that he agree not to serve in any
capacity with Mary Kay or any firm that competes with Avon
during that time. In addition, the proposed contract would
have barred Mr. Rochon from working for a competitor of Avon
for 10 years if Avon terminated the consulting contract for
reasons such as a breach of its terms, misconduct, or neglect
of duties.

civil matter. If there is intent to not report, that could be
criminal."
   Monday, for the second time in two years, the company said
it is recalling infant-monitoring devices to fix faulty alarm
systems. The machines, designed to be used in the homes of
high-risk babies, are supposed to sound an alarm when an
infant stops breathing, or if the monitor detects irregular
heart rate or respiration.
   The cause of the current recall seems to be that
electro-magnetic emissions can interfere with the monitor. A
company "safety alert" sent to parents last week warned them
to place the monitor and the baby "several feet away from
electrical devices such as televisions, nursery monitor
intercoms, oscillating fans and humidifiers."
   The agency didn't disclose how many deaths and injuries it
was investigating, but in January, the agency wrote to the
company about "numerous reports of deaths and malfunctions
associated with the models 8200 and 9200 and their alleged
failure to alarm during use."
   In October 1988, the agency criticized the company for
failing to disclose four deaths, four serious injuries and
two malfunctions.
   Company spokesman David Neuger said Aequitron agrees it
should have disclosed six of those cases. The failure to do
so, he said, "was just an oversight." Since last November,
the concern has reported all deaths or serious injuries
associated with the machine in any way, Mr. Neuger said,
though Aequitron denies any connection between those
tragedies and the machine.

   General Development Corp. said in Miami that bankers
approved a $14.5 million credit facility for its water and
waste water unit, General Development Utilities.
   The real estate development company, which filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code in April, said the loan will enable its water
and sewerage utility to operate outside of bankruptcy. The
loan is from a consortium of banks led by Bank of New York,
NCNB Corp. and Barclays PLC.

<TEXT>
   General Development said $2.5 million of the utility's
credit facility will be used for working capital and $12
million for capital expenditures. It said the utility will
now be able to pay $2.5 million in property taxes to various
counties where its plants are located.
   General Development also said St. Lucie County in Florida
assumed operation of General Development Utilities'
facilities in that county as the result of a condemnation
action. St. Lucie deposited $45 million with the state court
as a deposit on the assets. General Development said $38
million of those funds will eventually be used to pay off its
existing bank debt, $23 million of which applies to the St.
Lucie facilities.

   Executives Shift
   Blame For Declines
   In Quality, Poll Says

   Company Officials Maintain
   Product Standards Are
   Responsibility of Workers

   WASHINGTON -- Many top executives blame the lagging
quality of American goods and services on a lack of
commitment from workers rather than on themselves, according
to a new poll.
   Philip Crosby Associates Inc., a Winter Park, Fla.,
consulting firm that specializes in workplace-quality issues,
released a Gallup poll showing that chief executive officers
acknowledge America's problems with quality. But the
consulting firm said that executives are wrongly denying
their own responsibility for the problem.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to the Gallup survey of 401 chief executive
officers of U.S. companies, 62% said lack of managerial
attention doesn't affect quality, 70% said pressure for
short-term profits isn't a quality problem and 20% admit that
manufacturing speedups hamper quality. Almost 300 of the
chief executives run companies with sales of more than $75
million a year, said George Gallup, the pollster's
co-chairman.
   Lance Arrington, president of Philip Crosby, said it's
good that U.S. top executives are no longer reluctant to
admit that foreign competitors are doing a better-quality job
than they are. But he warned, "When executives look only to
the work force, only to those people who discover the defect
. . . they are ignoring the fact that the real problem most
likely rests somewhere back up the line, perhaps too close to
senior management decisions for comfort." Mr. Arrington, a
former ITT Corp. executive, said he and his firm have
counseled many U.S. and foreign companies on quality
training.
   Contrary to the views expressed in the Gallup poll, lack
of management attention, a drive for short-term profits and
manufacturing-speed demands have a crucial negative effect on
quality, Mr. Arrington said.
   While most executives don't seem to realize it, "{quality}
is often impaired by all of these three pressures a
significant portion of the time," Mr. Arrington said.
   Mr. Arrington's views tend to jibe with the conclusions of
the Commission on Skills of the Workplace, a 35-member group
formed by a former unit of Carnegie Corp. The commission last
week issued a report saying, in part, that corporate
management needs to reorganize the workplace in ways that
give workers more authority, while training them better, to
improve product quality and productivity.
   The Gallup survey confirms "the overwhelming need for
management to educate, train and instill a commitment to
quality . . . from the executive suite to the production
floor," Mr. Arrington said. He estimated that as much as 40%
of companies' service-oriented effort is wasted because it
involves correcting poor-quality work or planning for
expected defects.
   Nearly half of the poll respondents who have
quality-improvement programs developed them in the past four
years, but too many of them use "less than effective"
methods, the consultant said.

   Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc., citing a slowdown
in the art market, said it expects as much as a 75% decrease
in second-quarter earnings, to between six and 10 cents a

   A year earlier, Martin Lawrence earned $2 million, or 24

   Martin S. Blinder, chairman of the retail-art gallery
operator based in Los Angeles, said sales will be 12% to 17%
below the year-earlier figure. The fall-off reflects a
continued decline in consumer retail spending, he said,
besides the broad-based softening in the art market.
   The company said it blames the art market's current
weakness on disappointing auctions conducted in May by the
major New York auction houses. It believes the next major
test of the market's strength will come in November, at the
fall New York auctions.

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush gave new life to the moribund
budget talks by eating his "no new taxes" rhetoric and
declaring "tax revenue increases" are needed to shrink the
deficit.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu insisted privately
to Senate Republicans that the president hadn't said anything
new. But Mr. Bush's intended audience, top congressional
Democrats, heard the president say the words they had been
waiting for, and they pledged to begin serious negotiations
promptly toward a deficit-reduction compromise.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The president has concluded that tax increases are
necessary," said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D.,
Maine). "We share the president's view."
   The president's comments came in a statement the White
House released after Mr. Bush hosted a two-hour breakfast
with congressional leaders. He said, "It is clear to me that
both the size of the deficit problem and the need for a
package that can be enacted require all of the following:
entitlement and mandatory program reform; tax revenue
increases; growth incentives; discretionary spending
reductions; orderly reductions in defense expenditures; and
budget process reform."
   Republicans ranging from Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a
tax foe, to Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, who has drafted
a plan that calls for higher consumption taxes, later said
Mr. Bush was simply restating what he has said previously.
But Sen. Mitchell described Mr. Bush's statement as "clear
and unambiguous" and "new and significant."
   Congressional Democrats tried not to gloat publicly, but
privately they were jubilant that their tactic of
stonewalling in the budget negotiations produced what they
viewed as a significant concession from the president.
   "Sometimes you're not able to get to the substance until
you cure a political problem, and only he {Mr. Bush} could
cure the political problem," said Sen. Wyche Fowler (D.,
Ga.). "The great drawbridge has been let down by the
president, and now we ought to scramble out of the castle
into the fray."
   Summit negotiators said new deficit-reduction proposals
may surface this week, perhaps as early as today, when the
talks are scheduled to resume. House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt (D., Mo.) said House Democrats are drafting a plan
that would cut the projected deficit by $50 billion next
year. They're likely to rely on deep cuts in defense
spending.
   The senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, Sen.
Domenici, has been circulating a $50 billion plan that would
raise taxes about $24 billion next year, cut spending on
government benefit programs, known as entitlements, about $10
billion and cut other programs.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said there is
"a tacit understanding" among budget negotiators to reach an
agreement by mid-July. Senate Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser (D., Tenn.) said all sides hope for an agreement
before Congress has to vote on raising the federal debt
ceiling in late July or early August.
   Despite the new enthusiasm, negotiators are far from
agreement on exactly what taxes to raise, what spending to
cut and how to alter the budget process. Administration
officials noted that Mr. Bush stressed in his statement the
need for "budget process reform to assure that any bipartisan
agreement is enforceable."
   "We're now on the 20-yard line," Sen Dole said. "Only 80
yards left to go."
   Political analysts said Mr. Bush probably won't be hurt by
abandoning his memorable campaign promise. "The public
recognizes he is breaking his pledge; there is no ambiguity,"
said Democratic pollster Peter Hart. But when voters are
asked what difference that makes, Mr. Hart added, most reply:
"Hey, it really doesn't make any difference."
   According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll last
month, 89% of Americans thought a federal tax increase was
very likely or somewhat likely. Moreover, resistance to
higher taxes seems to be waning. In April, voters opposed any
tax increases 57% to 39%. A month later, they divided 48% to
48%. And when asked in the latest survey whether they would
rather live with the current federal budget deficit or tax
increases, voters opted for raising taxes by a 49% to 43%
margin.
   But while the president may be politically safe, other
Republicans stand to lose a valuable political weapon, and
they were showing their pain. "The White House has caved in
too quickly on tax increases," complained Rep. Chuck Douglas
(R., N.H.). With communism crumbling, Cold War rhetoric has
lost its bite, and some Republicans see the tax issue as the
most significant difference between them and Democrats.
   Republican pollster Linda DiVall said, "This is not only
going to make some Republicans very uncomfortable, it's also
going to force some of them to draw distinctions between
themselves and the president." Indeed, Rep. Robert Walker
(R., Pa.) quickly got 90 of the 176 House Republicans to sign
a letter to the president that said flatly, "We were stunned
by your announcement. . . . A tax increase in unacceptable."
   As long as the issue was simply whether to raise taxes,
political analysts say Republicans had a clear political
winner. But that issue is slipping away. "Someone who is
complaining about taxes being raised in the budget summit
will have to complain against both parties and the
president," said Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.)
   As the issue shifts to which taxes to raise, analysts say
Democrats may have an edge if they can succeed in painting
the president and other Republicans as reluctant to tax the
rich and eager to tax middle-income Americans.
   Whatever the political ramifications, Mr. Bush succeeded
in getting the budget summit back on track. In their first
six weeks, the talks had accomplished nothing. Democrats were
divided, and those who distrusted the administration were
blocking progress.
   Trying to salvage the summit, Budget Director Richard
Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady held separate
meetings last week and early this week with influential
Democrats, including Speaker Foley, Sen. Mitchell, and the
chairmen of the House and Senate tax-writing panels, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois.
Mr. Darman also spent two hours with Rep. Gephardt yesterday.
   All the Democrats stressed how important it was for Mr.
Bush to get personally involved, but aides said none of them
were certain what Mr. Bush would tell the congressional
leaders over the breakfast.
   A White House official said that after an hour with Mr.
Bush, the Democrats urged the president to address the tax
issue publicly. "They said, `We want a more public
admission,'" the official said. "Bush said, `OK, let's talk
about it.'"
   It took another hour, with occasional breaks to wait for
photocopies to be made, for the participants to agree on the
wording of Mr. Bush's statement. Each word was weighed. A
congressional source said a White House draft of the key
sentence began, "It is clear that. . . ." Democrats insisted
it say, "It is clear to me that. . . ."
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater refused to
concede that Mr. Bush had repudiated his campaign promise.
And at a meeting with Senate Republicans, Mr. Sununu argued
that Mr. Bush hadn't done anything he hadn't already done by
proposing $20 billion in new revenues in his January budget
proposal, according to New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
   But Sen. Domenici said of Mr. Bush's statement, "If it
helps those who did not want to proceed with negotiations,
then it has served its purpose."
   Mr. Bush told reporters, "I'll let the statement speak for
itself." Asked why he had moved now, Mr. Bush said, "It's
essential that these talks get moving and get moving faster."
   One Bush adviser said the president, though aware of the
political risks to Republicans, is signaling his willingness
to raise taxes because he believes "what counts most is
results." He added, "There's nothing as important to a
president as the condition of the economy . . . {and} the
huge major economic issue out there is the budget deficit."
   Lobbyists for one pillar of the Republican constituency,
the business community, quickly rallied around Mr. Bush and
his efforts to get deficit-reduction talks going.

   Corporate Takeover Battle Shaping Up
   Over East German Insurance Monopoly

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- In what appears to be the first
corporate takeover battle in East Germany, five West German
insurance companies made a 270 million mark ($161 million)
counteroffer for 51% of the state-owned East German insurance
monopoly.
   The move is intended to block a controversial plan by
Europe's largest insurance concern, Munich-based Allianz AG,
to acquire control of the East German monopoly, which will
become a West German-style joint-stock company called
Deutsche Versicherungs AG in July.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The five insurers said their offer about equals the price
Allianz would pay for its intended share in Deutsche
Versicherungs. The East German government earlier agreed to
sell Allianz a 49% stake in Deutsche Versicherungs, which
initially would have 100% control of the East German
insurance market.
   A spokesman for Cologne-based Colonia Versicherungs AG, a
leader of the group of five companies bidding against
Allianz, said the group had been talking with East German
officials since June 14 about taking a stake in the insurance
monopoly. Colonia identified the other members of the
competing group as Gothaer Lebensversicherung AG, Nordstern
Versicherungsgesellschaften, R&amp;V Versicherungsgruppe and
Wuertembergerische Feuer.
   The group's talks with the East Germans broke down Monday,
however, when the companies learned that Allianz planned to
increase its stake in Deutsche Versicherungs to 51%, giving
it control of the East German insurance market, the Colonia
spokesman said. Yesterday, the group submitted its
counteroffer for a 51% stake in Deutsche Versicherungs to
East German President Lothar de Maiziere.
   Allianz itself hasn't disclosed any intention to acquire
51% of Deutsche Versicherungs, and a spokesman at Allianz's
Munich headquarters wouldn't comment on the counteroffer.
Allianz has scheduled a news conference for this afternoon in
Munich to discuss the turn of events, the spokesman said.
   The counteroffer differs from the Allianz joint venture
agreement in one major way, the Colonia spokesman said. The
group wants to break Deutsche Versicherungs into five
regional insurance companies, with each of the five partners
taking control of one regional company. That would make the
East German insurance market more competitive than under the
Allianz plan, the Colonia spokesman said.
   Although current plans would give Allianz and Deutsche
Versicherungs a monopoly in the East German insurance market,
East Germany will open up this sector to competition under
the economic and monetary union with West Germany on July 1,
allowing other companies to compete directly with Deutsche
Versicherungs (and Allianz) in the East.
   But the Colonia spokesman said Allianz and Deutsche
Versicherungs would have an enormous unfair head start in
East Germany over other companies that would have "to start
from scratch."
   West German insurers have been campaigning against
Allianz's East German agreement, and antitrust authorities in
both countries are reviewing that accord. Some West German
government officials have expressed reservations about
allowing Allianz such a commanding share of the East German
insurance market.

   NEW YORK -- Continental Cablevision Inc. has asked CBS
Inc. to let the cable operator's local-access channel in
Concord, N.H., become an affiliate of the CBS network.
   The proposal by Boston-based Continental's New England
subsidiary points up the intensifying debate over programming
exclusivity, pitting CBS and other over-the-air broadcasters
against the cable industry. CBS declined to comment on the
request but may be likely to deny it, given the opposition of
its 200-plus affiliate stations to letting CBS programming
air on rival cable channels.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Continental Cablevision of New England Inc. proposed the
affiliation deal -- including a request that CBS pay the
cable system just as it pays local broadcast stations to air
CBS programming -- in the wake of a much broader request that
another cable operator, Denver-based Tele-Communications
Inc., made to the NBC network last week.
   Tele-Communications asked General Electric Co.'s NBC unit
to let TCI become an NBC affiliate wherever an NBC station
doesn't now operate. But the request is viewed as a political
ploy in the debate over program exclusivity, and NBC is
expected to oppose it.
   But H. Franklin Anthony, a senior vice president with
Continental Cablevision's New England unit, said his proposal
to CBS is a serious plan aimed at providing local news in
Concord, where a UHF affiliate of CBS had recently ceased
operations.
   The debate over program exclusivity heats up today as a
U.S. House subcommittee takes up a cable reregulation bill.
The bill includes a provision requiring cable channels to let
their programming be carried by new rivals such as direct
broadcast satellite, or DBS. While federal law lets a cable
system carry network programming without having to pay the
networks for it, cable channels aren't required to make their
fare available to rivals.
   A group of rural electrical cooperatives and other
entities yesterday urged the subcommittee to require cable
networks to make their programming available to new, rival
technologies. NBC is a partner in Sky Cable, a proposed DBS
service that hopes to carry cable programming if and when it
begins operating in the mid-1990s.

   NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp., which has been struggling
to restructure its finances to avoid bankruptcy-law
proceedings, said it is negotiating to sell its Business
Services unit.
   Western Union said a sale of the unit, which includes its
telex, telegram and electronic mail businesses, is contingent
on a restructuring of its debt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The telecommunications and financial services company has
been promoting its EasyLink electronic mail service as the
next-generation replacement for its dying telex business, the
source of most of its current problems. The possible sale
would leave Western Union with a Financial Services unit,
which includes its core money transfer and telegram
businesses.
   The company, which can't meet debt payments from current
cash flow, has said it may have to file for bankruptcy
protection if it can't restructure its debt. Western Union
said it hopes to complete such a restucturing by mid-July.
   Western Union failed on June 15 to make interest payments
on $530 million of 19 1/4% senior secured extendable reset
notes due 1992 and senior unsecured 16% notes due 1991.
   Business Services posted revenues of $303 million and an
operating profit of $72 million in 1989. It has 1,300
employees.

   Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan plans to export its
U.S.-made, four-wheel-drive Eclipse car to Europe, a
spokesman said.
   The Eclipse is produced by Diamond Star Motors Corp., a
joint venture between Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi that
began operations in Illinois in September 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Shipments of the model are expected to start in next
spring. Focusing on nations in Europe with relatively
moderate barriers to car imports, the company plans to export
200 Eclipse models a month to Switzerland, Austria and
Sweden. Another Mitsubishi spokesman said the car will have
60% local content, adding that the company's exports to
Europe also will contribute to lowering the U.S. trade
deficit. Sales of the Eclipse in the U.S. market in 1989
totaled 32,000 units, the company said.

   Adam Opel AG, the big West German operating unit of
Detroit-based General Motors Corp., said its 1989 profit more
than doubled to 1.12 billion marks ($669.5 million) from 505
million marks a year earlier.
   Sales increased 19% to 20.81 billion marks from 17.46
billion marks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Describing its performance as "absolutely the best results
in the history of the company," Opel predicted further growth
this year. "Taking into consideration 1989's results, plus
the numbers from the first half of 1990. . ., we assume that
we can conclude 1990 with better results than in 1989,"
Ferdinand Schwenger, chief financial officer, said.
   Opel said it held 17.8% of the West German domestic car
market in May. For this year's first five months, the company
estimated it boosted its West German market share on average
to about 17% from 16.1% in 1989. Opel officials said they see
this rise translating into 1990 sales growth of more than
10%, to an indicated total of about 23 billion marks.

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush made a politically charged
decision to delay oil drilling in environmentally sensitive
areas off the California and Florida coasts. But he did so
only after employing a favorite tactic: He called in members
of Congress to collaborate on the call.
   Lawmakers from California and Florida trooped into the
White House on consecutive days last month, and, seated
around a long conference table, gave Mr. Bush a telling
message. Neither delegation voiced much enthusiasm about
having drilling off its coast. Surprisingly, though, a few
Californians -- including Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston --
said drilling in some carefully selected spots might be
acceptable.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As the decision Mr. Bush unveiled makes clear, those
messages were pivotal. They galvanized the president's
natural inclination to tilt toward environmental and
political concerns in his decision, while offering a
consolation prize to his old friends in the oil industry.
   After 16 months of deliberations, Mr. Bush said he is
postponing oil-and-gas leasing and drilling in a large area
off Florida and nearly all of two large areas off northern
and southern California until the year 2000. He also will
permanently ban drilling in California's Monterey Bay and
delay leasing until after 2000 in the Georges Bank area of
the North Atlantic and an area off Oregon and Washington.
   But in a small concession to oil interests, Mr. Bush said
that 87 potentially lucrative tracts near existing drilling
off the California coast near Santa Barbara might be made
available for leasing in 1996, pending further scientific
studies of that area.
   "My goal is to create a much more carefully targeted
(drilling) program, one that is responsive to local concerns,
to environmental concerns, and to the need to develop
prudently our nation's domestic energy resources," Mr. Bush
declared.
   The drilling decision is among the most politically touchy
that Mr. Bush will handle in this election year, because it
directly affects the fortunes of Republican gubernatorial
candidates Pete Wilson in California and Robert Martinez in
Florida. Their elections are pivotal to GOP hopes of
controlling the drawing of as many as 10 new congressional
districts those states are likely to get as a result of this
year's census.
   And while Mr. Bush's decision falls short of the total
drilling ban environmental activists want, it seems to tilt
far enough toward environmental concerns to insulate those
two candidates from attack by environmental groups on the
issue.
   California's Mr. Wilson, now in the U.S. Senate, has been
particularly worried about the drilling issue, and at times
in recent months seemed to wish it would just disappear. At
one White House meeting with Mr. Bush, for instance, he
counseled the president against hasty decisions by reminding
him of the story of a death-row inmate who asked for some
fresh strawberries as part of his final meal. When told that
strawberries were out of season, the condemned man replied:
"That's all right, I'll wait."
   The story of how Mr. Bush settled the offshore leasing
issue speaks volumes about his decision-making style. Never a
snap decision-maker, he tends to agonize over a tough call.
Faced with a debate between warring factions, he invariably
tries to split the difference. And before moving, Mr. Bush
tries to draw all factions into his tent by meticulously
consulting them.
   In this case, Mr. Bush's own advisers were split over how
to finesse the delicate matter. Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan angered White House aides at one point in the
deliberations by suggesting in a speech that moratoriums on
drilling are a bad idea and leaving listeners with the
impression he wanted to plunge ahead with development. Mr.
Lujan was forced to issue a statement declaring he remained
committed to environmental protection.
   Meanwhile, such advisers as presidential pollster Robert
Teeter argued that the chances of actually drilling in
sensitive areas off California and Florida coasts were
remote, regardless of what Mr. Bush decided, because
congressional action and environmental lawsuits would tie up
developers anyway. Some White House aides contended it might
be wiser for Mr. Bush to save his political capital for a
later fight to begin drilling in the big Alaska National
Wildlife Refuge, which may have rich oil reserves.
   The offshore-leasing decision was especially agonizing for
Mr. Bush, because he was torn between his love for the
offshore-drilling business, which he helped create as a Texas
oil man, and his politically important promises to be an
"environmental president." During one meeting with lawmakers,
an aide recalls, Mr. Bush posed a series of rhetorical
questions that disclosed his inner struggle. "If we go down
this pike," Mr. Bush asked, "where are we going to get the
energy if we have another oil shock? Wind? Come on. Solar?"
Mr. Bush didn't answer his own queries.
   The long odyssey toward a decision actually began on an
airplane carrying presidential candidate George Bush to a
campaign event in California in October 1988. Campaign aides,
worried about staying on the right side of the environmental
concerns prominent in that hotly contested state, gave Mr.
Bush a draft of a speech in which he would declare that he
favored holding up drilling in both northern and southern
California for more study.
   Mr. Bush called the aides to his cabin on the plane and
questioned taking such a stand. "Do we want to lock this in?"
he asked. But he was persuaded to do so.
   Once he was in the White House, Mr. Bush tackled the
problem by turning to a time-honored method for putting off a
tough decision: He formed a task force, and called on it to
study proposed lease sales in both California and Florida
waters -- technically known as lease areas 91, 95 and 116.
   But simply forming a task force on these sensitive issues
produced wrangling. Interior Secretary Lujan proposed that he
become chairman of the group and that the Environmental
Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration be given merely advisory roles. White House
aides were worried that under his configuration, Mr. Lujan
and Energy Secretary James Watkins -- both generally
considered to be pro-drilling -- would be the dominant forces
on the task force. So White House officials pressured Mr.
Lujan to include the EPA and NOAA as full members of the task
force, along with budget director Richard Darman.
   The task force held hearings, read 11,000 pieces of mail
on the issue and even sent submarines to study the ocean
floor. But all this failed to produce a consensus, as was
apparent when the task force finished up a thick report and
gave it to President Bush at a White House meeting in
January. The report offered a wide array of options, which
aides say would have had the effect of delaying leasing a
year or two, five years or 10 years.
   Mr. Bush wasn't satisfied with his choices, and he didn't
face any burning timetable for deciding. So he ordered White
House aides to go to work further defining options. More
papers went back and forth to the president, filtered through
his chief of staff, John Sununu, and it became clear that
what Mr. Bush was seeking was a way to slice the issue even
thinner -- a way to allow drilling in some parts of the
controversial areas while blocking it entirely in others.
   Meanwhile, lobbying intensified on both sides of the
issue. In January, for example, Chevron Corp. Chairman K.T.
Derr, a politically active friend of the president, sent a
three-page letter saying he could understand delaying the
California lease sale for as long as five years, because
drilling there already has been slowed by state and local
concerns, but arguing that there wasn't any reason for a
delay in Florida.
   Last month, Mr. Bush called the task force back in for
more deliberating, and met with the congressional
delegations. Finally, about a month ago, Mr. Bush got a staff
memo outlining a decision he liked.
   All that was left was timing the announcement. Ultimately,
White House aides say, they decided to announce the
offshore-leasing decision, which they hope will satisfy
environmentalists, on the same day they unveiled a decision
to allow logging to proceed despite concerns about the
northern spotted owl, a decision environmentalists won't
like.
   As is often the case with attempted compromises, Mr. Bush
didn't entirely please either side on the drilling issue. The
oil industry reacted with bitter complaints. "These decisions
on offshore oil and natural gas leasing are harmful to our
country and economy," the American Petroleum Institute
declared. "Locking up these energy-rich lands at a time when
our dependency on foreign energy is escalating is a serious
mistake."
   The National Ocean Industries Association, an organization
representing the offshore-oil industry, declared that Mr.
Bush has "abdicated his responsibility to provide safe and
dependable energy supplies for the American people."
   Oil companies with significant offshore investments echoed
the petroleum institute. Phillips Petroleum Co. said that
even though none of its current plans are affected by the
moratorium, it nonetheless is disappointed.
   "The oil industry has shown it can drill and produce oil
offshore in an environmentally safe manner. . . . Not
developing U.S. offshore oil and gas reserves can increase
tanker traffic (for importing), a source of recent oil-spill
problems," Phillips said. The Bartlesville, Okla., company
earlier this year took a $280 million charge on its offshore
California investments where production has been stalled by
Santa Barbara-based citizens groups fearful of transportation
mishaps.
   A spokesman for Chevron said, "Our initial reaction to
what we're seeing in news reports is that the president's
actions seem to go too far. We'll need to take a look at
what's actually been announced and study the details before
we have any more to say."
   Environmentalists generally expressed pleasure, but also
chided Mr. Bush for not calling for a permanent drilling ban.
"These are just temporary, politically expedient steps," said
the American Oceans Campaign. "If the president sincerely
cares about the environment, he will join with those seeking
permanent protection for these and other important coastal
areas."

   Zeist, the Netherlands -- Ad Hoogendijk conducts his
practice in a narrow office lined with shelves neatly marked
"Philosophy," "Sexology" and "Literature." Tomes by Masters
and Johnson, Wilhelm Reich, Spinoza and Kant stand next to
Jack Kerouac's fiction and Dante's "Divine Comedy." The
selection may reflect some of the free spirit of the '60s,
but Mr. Hoogendijk's work revolves around the eternal
questions of life and death. He is a consulting philosopher,
a sage for hire.
   Mr. Hoogendijk, 39 years old, is the first among a dozen
Dutch philosophers to have set up a consultancy practice. For
a price of 100 guilders ($53), paid at the end of each
75-minute session, men and women from all over Holland visit
the suburbs of this small town near Utrecht, climb the stairs
to the second floor of an anonymous red brick building in a
characterless housing development, and sit down to talk about
matters of fate and destiny.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The first modern wise man with an hourly rate was Gerd B.
Achenbach of Cologne, West Germany. He started guiding the
perplexed nine years ago. Soon the Danes began making
appointments with their own home-grown rent-a-Kierkegaards.
But today the Dutch are the most enthusiastic converts to
taxi-cogitation. Mr. Hoogendijk has a theory to explain this.
Here it is, free of charge:
   "Ever since the Middle Ages, we Dutch have been a nation
of traders. A generation of philosophers has now emerged who
want to put that ancestral trading temperament into
practice."
   Mr. Hoogendijk, who has the height, blond hair and angular
cheekbones of a Northern seafarer, wants to offer his logical
and epistemological skills to industry. He believes
philosophy can be fruitfully applied to career coaching in
big companies suffering from demotivated staff and
relationship problems.
   If there's one thing that makes Mr. Hoogendijk wrinkle his
sapient brow with disdain, however, it's the suggestion that
what he is doing resembles therapy. "I have explained again
and again why what I do isn't therapy," he snarls
unstoically, flushing slightly. The blowfish that dangles in
front of the window trembles on its string. "I am not a
therapist," he says. "I don't want to be a therapist. I am
not interested in people's past; I like to talk about the
future. I don't diagnose and I don't prognosticate." If
comparisons must be made, he would rather be likened to a
lawyer.
   At Amsterdam University, where he obtained a master's
degree in philosophy, Mr. Hoogendijk found that he and a
couple of fellow students tended to apply their philosophical
training to the problems in their daily lives. "I thought,
why not try to do something practical with philosophy?" He
then studied sexology and pastoral theology at Rijks
University in Utrecht, and opened a practice in a room in his
house.
   The first "visitors," as he and his fellow consulting
philosophers prefer to call their clients, came through the
small ads he put in the newspapers ("Philosophical practice
for clarifying discussions about vital questions"), the
flyers he sent out, and the dozens of interviews he gave on
the radio and to the press. The very first person he saw was
a woman in her 50s who ran a company and felt, he says, "that
she had a philosophical attitude to life, and problems at
work that she wanted to talk about."
   Three years on, Mr. Hoogendijk has written a book,
"Spreekuur bij een filosoof" ("A Philosopher's Office
Hours"), soon to be translated into English. It's an
examination of the in and outs of practical philosophy, with
a special emphasis on his personal pantheon of philosophers:
Michel Foucault, Herbert Marcuse, Jean-Paul Sartre and Hannah
Arendt. As their acolyte, his ambition is to take
existentialist, phenomenological and structuralist thought
and apply it to various aspects of contemporary society.
   Dividing his time between his private practice and the
philosophy classes he teaches in vocational schools, Mr.
Hoogendijk says he has between two and 15 consultancies a
week. He has spoken to people as young as 18 who were worried
about what university studies to choose to older folks
worried about death. Some visitors may come just once, but
the average time people need to talk things over is several
months.
   A first-time visitor finds herself settling down in the
yellow wickerwork chair, with Mr. Hoogendijk sitting across
from her in a more lavish leather swivel armchair. There is a
low table between them. The room is bright and impeccably
tidy.
   Most visitors are concerned with problems related to their
careers. Others come because they are worried about personal
problems or the meaning of life. Mr. Hoogendijk tries to help
his clients find their own answers and to get them thinking
about identity, ability and ambition.
   "Most people don't know what they want," says Mr.
Hoogendijk, touching his pale yellow psychedelic tie. He
adds, sounding, despite his denials, very much like a
therapist, "Many have buried their desires. I try to
encourage a form of Utopian thinking." He likes to start by
pinpointing the problems in a person's life, before building
an ideal life plan, in 10-year slices, made of "all the
dreams, ideals and wishes." Then visitor and philosopher talk
about it and try to build a bridge, as Mr. Hoogendijk puts
it, between the real world of mortgages, families and sexual
frustration and the secret world of fantasy.
   If this sounds like something any craggy fellow could do,
Mr. Hoogendijk and other consulting philosophers have formed
the Organization for Philosophical Practice (VFP) to keep
opportunistic Platos-come-lately out of the wisdom-monger
game. VFP members meet regularly in an Amsterdam hotel called
De Filosoof, run by Ida Jongsma, a philosopher friend of Mr.
Hoogendijk from student days.
   Mr. Hoogendijk sees a rich future for his field. For too
long, he says, his country's philosophers have sat in their
ivory towers, oblivious to the teeming world beyond their
walls, even though they were writing books about life, love
and death, fear and freedom -- subjects with obvious
importance to the everyday life of ordinary people.
   "Philosophy," he concludes, "is destined to become more
and more important. We're entering an era when people want to
feel that there's a connection between their work and the
meaning of life. And that's going to change a lot of things."

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it signed a letter of
intent with Czechoslovakia to study a joint venture to
produce 250,000 auto transmissions a year.
   While only a preliminary step toward a possible agreement,
the announcement comes amid a flurry of Eastern European
proposals that GM has made since governments there began
giving way to freer markets a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A GM spokesman said the company and the government should
complete the current study within the next "few months" and
decide whether to go ahead with a project. Actual production
of transmissions would begin two years after the completion
of the study.
   GM currently is in talks with two Czech companies
concerning the possibility of joint vehicle production. The
transmission negotiations are separate from those
discussions, the company said. A GM spokesman said that
before reaching an agreement to build transmissions in
Czechoslovakia the company and the government must iron out
currency and infrastructure problems, as well as reach
agreement on government regulations.
   "We've done a lot of work, and this will be the final
stages," a GM spokesman said.
   GM's goal is to boost its European vehicle production by
25% to two million vehicles over the next five years, partly
by using Eastern Europe as a source. Czech-built
transmissions could be an important contributor to that plan,
a spokesman said.
   GM also said it plans to have dealer and distribution
networks in six Eastern European countries by the end of the
year. The company previously announced production ventures
with local companies in Hungary and East Germany.

   Limits on Medicine
   Found Hard on Elderly

<TEXT>
   WHEN MEDICAID officials in New Hampshire adopted measures
to limit prescription purchases, drug costs went down. But
admissions to both nursing homes and hospitals for elderly
patients went up.
   For 11 months in the early 1980s, New Hampshire limited
Medicaid recipients of all ages to three prescriptions per
month. Researchers at Harvard Medical School found that the
cap was particularly hard on elderly people with such
problems as diabetes, heart disease and asthma who often take
several different pills to control symptoms.
   The research -- reported last week at the annual meeting
of the Association for Health Services Research -- compared
about 440 New Hampshire patients with 1,532 Medicaid
recipients in New Jersey, where there wasn't any cap on
prescriptions.
   Preliminary results showed "a twofold increase in the rate
of admission to nursing homes" among the New Hampshire group,
Stephen B. Soumerai, principal investigator on the study,
told the meeting, held outside Washington. The
hospitalization rate was lower than that, but still higher
than in New Jersey, he said. Risk of admission to nursing
homes and hospitals was nearly identical in both states
before the cap was imposed and after it was replaced with a
less restrictive policy.
   Nursing homes were exempt from New Hampshire's drug cap,
and some admissions likely resulted when doctors referred
patients so they could get their drugs, Mr. Soumerai
reasoned. But some nursing home admissions and most hospital
stays probably reflected worsening health for patients who
couldn't get their medicines, he said.
   Researchers haven't formally analyzed the cost impact, but
the findings suggest the savings from reduced drug costs were
probably wiped out by the increased institutional care. Said
Diane Rowland, a Johns Hopkins University health policy
researcher: "It's a great example of a . . . policy that is
penny-wise and pound-foolish."
                                                                                                       

   Death of Rural Hospitals
   Isn't Medicare's Fault
                                                                                                       

   ABOUT 130 rural hospitals closed between 1987 and 1989,
and many hospital officials blame insufficient Medicare
payments for helping to undermine the facilities. But a new
study by the General Accounting Office asserts that, except
for the smallest hospitals, Medicare isn't driving rural
facilities to the graveyard.
   Hospitals suffering losses on Medicare patients had
comparable losses on patients whose care was paid by other
sources, Marsha Lillie-Blanton, a health policy analyst for
the GAO, said at the health-services research meeting.
Instead, small hospitals with low occupancy were at higher
risk of closing irrespective of Medicare reimbursement.
For-profit rural hospitals were eight times more likely to
close than their nonprofit counterparts, she said.
   Peter Snow, vice president, Southwest Community Health
Services, an Albuquerque, N.M., owner of 10 not-for-profit
facilities, disputes some of the GAO's findings. For one
procedure, he says, Medicare pays $1,000 more per patient for
an urban hospital in Albuquerque than it does for the same
procedure in rural Valencia, N.M.
   The company decided to convert the Valencia facility to
primary care and transport acute cases to the city 35 miles
away. But it will subsidize a more remote hospital facing the
same Medicare payment disadvantage to ensure access for its
rural constituency. By capping rural hospital payments,
"Medicare is trying to force the hospitals to become more
efficient," Mr. Snow says. "Let's at least acknowledge that
it is {also} putting those hospitals at risk."
                                                                                                       

   Care Rarely Vanishes
   When Facilities Close
                                                                                                       

   WHEN HOSPITALS do close, is the local population at risk?
To address the question, American Hospital Association
researchers checked with ambulance services in communities
where hospitals had closed in 1989.
   On average, the survey showed that in rural areas, another
hospital was open within 18.2 miles of a facility that
closed; in cities, an open hospital was within 3.4 miles. In
38 of 41 rural closings, ambulance drivers were within 30
minutes of an open hospital, the survey said.
   Hospital proximity is just one measure of access to care,
the researchers cautioned. Still, the results suggest that in
most cases, closing a hospital didn't deprive consumers of
care.
   The survey, part of a broader study of market factors
affecting hospital closings, suggests that competition is
driving some hospitals to shut down, says Simonetti Samuels,
senior economist at the American Hospital Association. "To
some extent, that closure is a healthy process. Some
{industry} downsizing is necessary."
   But consolidation in the hospital industry is expected to
accelerate over the next few years. Ms. Samuels and her
colleagues wonder whether that will leave the nation with a
shortage of beds just as an aging population demands more
services. "The next round of closings may look very
different," she says.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE attended the health-services meeting,
up from 750 last year and 550 in 1987. . . . U.S. outlays for
the lead federal agency for health-services research soared
to $99 million this fiscal year from $50 million a year ago,
reflecting burgeoning interest in investigating the
effectiveness of the U.S. health-care system.

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Federal Civil Cases Rarely Reach a Trial

   Almost 95% of all private civil cases filed in federal
courts never reach trial, ending instead in settlements or
other pretrial dispositions, according to a study by Rand
Corp.
   Moreover, the percentage of cases tried appears to be
declining steadily. Researchers at Rand found that about
10.9% of the cases that concluded in 1971 reached the trial
stage, whereas only 6.6% reached trial in 1986. This
represents roughly a 40% decline during the years covered by
the study.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Because of the increase in lawsuits filed during this
period, however, the number of trials increased. The study
was based on statistics generated by the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts.
   Terence Dungworth, the Rand researcher who co-authored the
report, called the proportional drop in trials "a significant
reduction." Judges may be disposing of cases by "different
methods due to the fact that the courts are overburdened," he
suggested. "Perhaps it's not possible for trials to be held
in as many cases."
   The study itself did not reach conclusions about the
reasons for the trend. But the statistics showed that
compared with 1971, a greater percentage of cases were
concluded in 1986 after judges got involved -- that is, after
motions had been filed by the parties or after the parties
met with the judge.
   Several lawyers and judges suggested that fewer civil
trials are being held because of pressure on judges to hear
the burgeoning criminal case load. "Civil cases may be
getting squeezed out," said federal Judge William W
Schwarzer, director of the Federal Judicial Center in
Washington.
   "Trials are very expensive and burdensome," he said. "If
the parties can find a way of disposing of their dispute
without a trial, that's good. If a dispute cannot be disposed
of after all reasonable efforts and the parties cannot get to
trial, that's bad."
   Judge Joseph F. Weis Jr. of the federal appeals court in
Pittsburgh said that as civil and criminal caseloads have
increased, judges have stepped up their efforts to manage
litigation effectively, and that often leads to settlement.
Judges' efforts to bring parties together earlier may be one
reason for the drop in trials, says Judge Weis, chairman of
the Federal Courts Study Committee, which has been charged by
Congress with studying the federal court system.
   Defense and plaintiffs lawyers also point to the increased
cost of litigation as one reason that parties are settling
earlier. Stephen J. Paris, a Boston litigator who is a vice
president of the Defense Research Institute, views the
apparent increase in settlements as a favorable development.
"Those cases are using up less of the judge's time and legal
expense," he said. But Mr. Paris noted that some litigants
could be settling out of "frustration" because the increased
criminal caseload means it is harder to get a civil trial.
   The possibility that frustration may be an impetus to
settlement worries even plaintiffs lawyers who often prefer
to settle cases. "Trial is the lifeblood of the system," says
Paul D. Rheingold of the New York law firm of Rheingold &amp;
McGowan. "Everyone is entitled to their day in court. If
there's some factor working that's coercing people into not
having their day in court -- which they want -- that's not
good."
   Another finding of the Rand study was that "the aggregate
performance of the federal district courts had remained
remarkably stable during the 1970s and 1980s, despite a
substantial increase in caseload during that period."
Nationwide, according to the report, "delay was about the
same in 1986 as it was in 1971" and there was little evidence
"to support the view that time to disposition has been
lengthening." That conclusion, says Rand researcher Mr.
Dungworth, "is a surprise to most people."

   PASSIVE SMOKING CONTRIBUTED to worker's heart disease,
lawsuit alleges.
   A former employee of ComData Network Inc. filed suit
against the Brentwood, Tenn., company claiming that cigarette
smoke in his work environment aggravated his heart condition.
   The complaint, filed earlier this month in a Dallas state
court, alleges that Michael Attar "suffered extreme physical
and mental pain" partly because of his "continual exposure to
cigarette smoking second-hand" while working as a sales
manager for ComData.
   Although cases against employers have attempted to link
second-hand tobacco smoke with lung and respiratory
illnesses, this case appears to be among the first that seeks
to prove that so-called passive smoking contributed to an
employee's heart disease.
   A recent study by doctors at the University of California
estimated that 37,000 Americans die each year from heart
disease caused by passive smoking. That figure is nearly 10
times higher than the number of lung cancer deaths attributed
to passive smoking in an Environmental Protection Agency
report released this week. The EPA has not taken a position
on the effects of passive smoking on heart disease.
   Because heart disease is more common than lung cancer and
results in more deaths, lawyers say that evidence linking
heart disease to second-hand tobacco smoke could spur an
increase in litigation over passive smoking. If the
University of California study is right, "we're going to see
a gigantic increase in the number of worker {compensation}
suits and probably product liability suits," says Richard
Danard, a professor of law at Northeastern University.
   A spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, an industry
advocacy group, warned that "People are now using these scare
headlines as an attempt to take legal action." He says that
the University of California study is unsubstantiated and
"decidedly political."
   Litigators and medical experts say that it could be
difficult to prove in court that passive smoking caused or
significantly worsened a plaintiff's heart disease. Because
there are so many factors other than second-hand tobacco
smoking that can cause heart disease, such a case "would be
difficult to prosecute," says Marc Edell of Budd Larner Gross
Rosenbaum Greenberg &amp; Sade in Short Hills, N.J. Mr. Edell
represents the family of Rose Cipollone, a smoker who died of
lung cancer, in its suit against Liggett Group Inc., a
tobacco company.
   Still, the possibility of court battles over passive
smoking and heart disease adds a new worry for businesses
already under pressure from anti-smoking groups and employees
who advocate a smoke-free workplace.
   A company that permits its employees to smoke "does so at
great legal risk," says Mark Pertschuk, executive director of
Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights in Berkeley, Calif.

   JUDGES SAY NO to proposed legislation on federal courts.
   Congressional leaders are pushing legislation aimed at
reducing delay and expense in civil lawsuits. But
representatives of the Judicial Conference, the policy-making
arm of the federal courts, told the Senate Judiciary
Committee the conference opposes a bill that would require
each federal trial court to develop and adopt a plan to cut
civil litigation costs and delay.
   The conference supports another provision of the
legislation that would create 77 new federal judgeships, but
believes more additions are needed to handle mounting
caseloads, Judge Walter McGovern testified. The Judicial
Conference has recommended 96 new judgeships.
   The bill in question has bipartisan support: Judiciary
Committee Chairman Joseph Biden of Delaware introduced it
jointly with the panel's ranking Republican, Strom Thurmond
of South Carolina. The committee is expected to vote on the
legislation next month, and the creation of more judgeships
is expected to pass easily. There is probably a majority on
the Judiciary Committee willing to support some kind of
system designed to manage civil cases more efficiently,
committee staff members said.
   Some Democratic lawmakers have privately expressed
surprise and anger that Mr. Biden would lead an effort to
expand the federal judiciary during a Republican
administration. The president nominates federal judges, and
the nominees require confirmation by the Senate.
   Republicans have praised Mr. Biden's action on judgeships
as demonstrating his willingness to be a conciliator on a
sharply divided committee. "Rather than take a narrow,
partisan view of the dire need for new federal judgeships,
the senator from Delaware has done the responsible thing,"
said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah).
   As to the case-management proposal, Judge Robert Peckham
of the Judicial Conference testified that such legislation
would duplicate a management program recently adopted by the
conference. Judge Peckham also said that as a constitutional
matter of separation of powers, Congress shouldn't interfere
with the procedures of the judiciary. He softened his
criticism by saying that federal judges have long supported
the "concerns that inspire this proposed legislation."
   The Biden-Thurmond case-management proposals had already
been made more flexible in response to objections from the
Judicial Conference that Congress was trying to
"microregulate" judges.

   MARCOS ATTORNEY says case is "fantasy" based on
circumstantial evidence.
   In closing arguments, Gerry Spence, Imelda Marcos's lead
attorney, said the former first lady of the Philippines knew
nothing more about money than how to spend it. Mrs. Marcos,
on trial in federal court in Manhattan, is accused of using
$200 million in money stolen from the Philippines to buy
jewelry, artwork and real estate in the U.S.
   "She's a world-class shopper," Mr. Spence said. "But she
is a world-class decent human being too."
   Mr. Spence told the jury that Mrs. Marcos may have helped
spend the money but that didn't mean she knew where it came
from. He said she was being unfairly held responsible for
alleged wrongdoing by her late husband, Ferdinand, who died
in September.
   "Where's the beef? Where's the evidence that she knew?"
Mr. Spence said. He said that instead of proving racketeering
and fraud charges, prosecutors had built a case based on
circumstantial evidence that is open to interpretation.
   Mr. Spence said Mrs. Marcos had no reason to suspect that
the wealth of President Marcos, who was ousted in 1986, was
wrongfully gained. "Suppose the truth is, he embezzled the
money? What's the wife supposed to do? Is she supposed to
investigate him? Isn't a woman entitled to believe her
husband?" Mr. Spence said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella told jurors
earlier this week to use their common sense to conclude that
Mrs. Marcos, who was a member of President Marcos's cabinet,
must have known where the money came from. Prosecutors claim
that Mrs. Marcos used various fronts to transfer funds and
make purchases.
   Closing arguments for Mrs. Marcos's co-defendant, Adnan
Khashoggi, will be made today, and jury deliberations could
begin later this week.

   BOWIE KUHN THREATENED with contempt in bankruptcy
proceeding.
   A federal Bankruptcy Court judge ordered the former
baseball commissioner and his attorney to explain why they
shouldn't be held in contempt of court.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Prudence B. Abram issued the order
and scheduled a hearing for Monday afternoon. The judge said
that Mr. Kuhn and his attorney, Cory Friedman of Kelley Drye
&amp; Warren, had violated a temporary restraining order
prohibiting them from "commencing, continuing or prosecuting
litigation against" former partners of the New York law firm
of Myerson &amp; Kuhn, which has disbanded and filed for Chapter
11 protection.
   Marine Midland Bank had sued Mr. Kuhn seeking to recover
about $3 million in debt that he had personally guaranteed.
Mr. Kuhn, in turn, sued his former partners for the money.
Mr. Kuhn has pursued his claim in federal court in Manhattan
despite the stay on litigation issued by Judge Abram. Judge
Abram said in her order that Mr. Kuhn's action had cost
Myerson &amp; Kuhn more than $10,000 in legal fees that he should
now reimburse.
   Mr. Kuhn now lives in Florida. He is one of only a few
partners who hasn't made a commitment to contribute personal
assets to a plan that would end the bankruptcy proceedings.
   Mr. Friedman said of the order, "We think it's totally
without merit and we'll be responding to it."

   West Co., Phoenixville, Pa., said it expects to report a
drop in second-quarter earnings that "could be greater than
50%" because of production problems in the U.S. and a
curtailment of business in Brazil.
   For the quarter ended July 2, 1989, the maker of
specialized packaging for the pharmaceutical industry
reported net income of $6.8 million, or 42 cents a share, on
sales of $79.5 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   West cited two unrelated reasons for the anticipated
earnings decline. The first was the discovery of substandard
raw materials that forced a halt in production. The company
said it had to conduct new testing and inspections before it
could begin output of a replacement product.
   The second reason, West said, was a series of changes in
Brazilian monetary and fiscal policy, imposed in recent
months. Those changes "substantially curtailed" West's
activity in Brazil.
   Rene L. Guerster, West's president and chief executive
officer, said the expected lower results will include a
reserve for expenses related to the raw-material problem. He
didn't quantify the reserve.
   However, Mr. Guerster noted that West has resumed
production and that Brazilian operations are returning to
normal.

   PRINCETON, N.J. -- Laurance S. Rockefeller, who majored in
philosophy at Princeton University, donated $21 million to
his alma mater for a center to study and teach human values.
   Mr. Rockefeller, a 1932 graduate, called the donation "the
fulfillment of my Princeton education," and a
"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" to help provide training
embracing "an understanding of the relationship of mind, body
and spirit" to basic values and a sense of well-being.

   The Princeton University Center for Human Values is
scheduled to open this fall. It will offer interdisciplinary
undergraduate courses and graduate seminars in ideas and
issues relating to religion, philosophy, ethics, history,
politics and the sciences. It will also sponsor discussions
and lectures and help finance research projects. The center
initially will include at least six new endowed faculty
positions.
   The idea for the center evolved after the 1988 inaugural
speech of Princeton's President Harold T. Shapiro, in which
he said a modern university should give students "an ability
to engage in the moral discourse required to give greater
meaning to our national life."
   Traditional university divisions can make it difficult to
examine the ethical issues that range across society,
Princeton officials said.
   Mr. Rockefeller, a son of John D. Rockefeller Jr., has
devoted much of his time and money to conservation issues;
previous donations to Princeton have helped fund dormitories,
a residential college and a molecular-biology laboratory.

   BONN -- With German monetary and economic unification
rolling ahead at top speed, the West German government
proposed a full political merger by mid-December.
   In a "discussion paper" drawn up by Bonn's Interior
Ministry, the West Germans proposed that the two Germanys
unite formally the day after all-German elections are held.
Such a vote seems likely Dec. 9 or Dec. 16.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On Sunday, the West German mark will become the official
currency in East Germany under a treaty designed to integrate
the two nations' economies. Among many other measures, the
agreement also includes a plan for harmonizing tax systems
and introducing Western-style unemployment insurance in the
East. The next step is to negotiate a treaty on political
unity. The discussion paper is supposed to smooth the way for
the dialogue.
   The two nations have agreed to synchronize their efforts
with international negotiations aimed at sorting through the
"external aspects" of unity, such as military orientation. At
talks in East Berlin last week, the Soviet Union -- which
takes part in the talks with the two Germanys, the U.S.,
France, and Britain -- sought to slow the rush toward
integration.
   By stepping up the pace of political-unity talks, Bonn is
putting pressure on these negotiations to yield early
results.

   MANDELA ASKED Congress to help in bringing democracy to
South Africa.
   In a historic speech, the anti-apartheid leader asked a
joint session of Congress to support financially efforts of
the African National Congress in South Africa. "Our country,
which continues to bleed and suffer pain, needs democracy,"
he said. Mandela, ANC deputy president, thanked Congress for
its sanctions legislation and said he was encouraged to know
that U.S. lawmakers and the Bush administration agree that
sanctions should stay in place. But he urged them to "go
further and assist us with the material resources" needed to
promote the peace process.

   Mandela didn't ask for a specific amount of money.
Congress already has approved $42 million to assist efforts
toward democracy in South Africa.

   The Vatican ruled out public dissent by theologians,
striking at those challenging papal authority and the
church's birth-control ban. A Vatican commission, in a
28-page document approved by Pope John Paul II, said the
church has suffered "serious harm" from open criticism and
told theologians to uphold its moral teaching or remain

   EC leaders agreed to design a major Soviet aid program.
The accord, announced at a Dublin summit, didn't set specific
aid levels, pending completion of studies of the Soviet
economy. The vagueness of the commitment was seen as a

President Mitterrand.

   Louisiana's Senate approved a bill prohibiting abortion
even in cases of rape and incest. The measure would send
doctors who perform abortions to prison for 10 years. The
legislation, which would create the toughest state abortion
law in the country, goes back to the House for further
consideration. Gov. Roemer has vowed to veto it.

   NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms were little changed in the week
ended Tuesday.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold directly by
banks were mostly flat to down slightly. The average yield on
a one-year consumer CD remained at 7.85%, while two-year CDs
fell to 7.91% from 7.93%, according to an 18-bank survey by
Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While none of the banks in the survey offered a yield as
high as 9%, investors can still find consumer CDs at some
banks that yield that much or more.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold by leading
broker dealers were also little changed. Average yields on
six-month CDs eased to 8.15% from 8.17%, while average yields
on one-year CDs remained at 8.17%, according to Banxquote.
   Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were up
slightly. However, the gains are so slight that average
yields for most maturities are still below the levels of two
weeks ago. Average yields on one-year jumbo CDs rose to 7.94%
from 7.90%, while five-year maturities rose to 8.25% from
8.22%.
   "Rates moved in a very narrow range,"said Norberto Mehl,
chairman of Banxquote. This is evidence, he said, of the
current retrenchment in the banking industry. "Banks are
under no competitive pressure to increase rates since they
don't need to attract cash to make new loans," This is
especially evident among banks in Texas and Florida, he said,
where average yields are the lowest in the country.

   NEW YORK -- The Soviet Union has invited the New York
Stock Exchange to organize a seminar on the development of
securities exchanges.
   The seminar, to be held in Moscow in October, will be
jointly sponsored with the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Finance and
Gosbank, the state bank.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Deputy Prime Minister and State Economic Reform
Commission Chairman Leonid Abalkin invited the Big Board
chairman and chief executive officer, John J. Phelan Jr., to
lead a delegation of U.S. financial experts. Mr. Abalkin
called the initiative a "concrete step" toward the
development of a securities market in the Soviet Union.
   The invitation follows a suggestion first made by
President Bush to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev at their
Malta meeting in December 1989. In the intervening months,
there have been discussions between Soviet government
officials and the New York Stock Exchange concerning the
scope, timing and administrative details of such a seminar.
   The Soviet government recently authorized creation of
public companies with the right to sell shares and issue
bonds.

   NEW YORK -- Reports that President Bush acknowledged the
need for increased tax revenue to trim the budget deficit
sparked a brief bond market rally yesterday.
   Mr. Bush's remarks initially cheered the credit markets
because a smaller deficit would likely reduce the
government's borrowing needs. That, in turn, would ease
supply pressures and create more room for interest rates to
fall.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the euphoria didn't last very long. As bond prices
moved higher, Wall Street's big bond dealers were caught
holding short positions and wound up with large trading
losses. The surprise rally made it more difficult to generate
investor interest in the government's $11.25 billion two-year
note auction. And Mr. Bush's statement, which triggered the
rally in the first place, was later downplayed by other
Republican politicians, leaving dealers and investors
confused and frustrated.
   "It was a difficult morning for the street," said John
Costas, co-manager of trading at First Boston Corp. Although
the Treasury's two-year note auction proceeded smoothly, he
said the auction would have gone much better had prices not
surged ahead of the sale.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, which jumped nearly
one point after Mr. Bush's statement, ended 1/2 point higher
for a gain of $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its
price, fell to 8.51%.
   Traders said the rally forced dealers to scramble to cover
their "shorts." These dealers were betting that bond prices
would fall as a huge supply of new securities hit the market.
In a short sale, dealers and professional traders sell
borrowed securities and later seek to make a profit by
replacing what was borrowed with cheaper securities. That
strategy backfired yesterday, when prices rose instead and
dealers had to cover their money-losing shorts by purchasing
bonds from other dealers.
   "When we got the Bush statement on the tape, it caused a
short squeeze," said Jeffrey A. Fagan, a trading manager at
Discount Corp. of New York, a primary dealer of government
bonds.
   Meanwhile, the lower-than-expected yields discouraged some
retail investors from buying the Treasury's new two-year
notes. "We did not see a lot of customer interest in the two
year notes," said Mr. Fagan.
   The notes were sold at an average yield of 8.41%. That was
down from 8.52% average yield at the previous two-year note
auction May 23 and was the lowest yield at a two-year note
auction since 8.21% on Jan. 24, 1990.
   Lacy Hunt, an economist at Carroll McEntee &amp; McGinley Inc.
termed the auction "OK to slightly weak." And he said the
unenthusiastic response to the two-year notes does not bode
well for today's sale of $8.25 billion of four-year notes.
   One sign of lukewarm investor demand for the two-year
notes was that the Treasury received only 2.21 bids for every
one it accepted, the lowest bid-to-cover ratio at a two-year
note sale since August 1988. The average bid-to-cover ratio
at the previous 12 two-year note auctions was 2.70-to-1,
according to Reid, Thunberg &amp; Company, Inc.
   Demand from individual investors was lighter than at
previous auctions. Individual investors typically buy at
Treasury auctions by placing noncompetitive tenders, agreeing
to accept the price and yield set by competitive bidding.
Noncompetitive tenders at yesterday's two-year note sale
totaled $1.49 billion, down from $1.66 billion at the
two-year note sale in May and from $1.90 billion in April.
   Still, in when-issued trading activity, the yield on the
two-year notes fell slightly to 8.40%, a sign that demand
picked up for the new notes after the auction was completed.
The new four-year notes to be sold today were quoted
yesterday at yields of 8.49%, down 0.05 percentage point.
                                                                                                       

   Asset- Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   New issuance of asset-backed securities heated up again
after a brief pause from last week's frenetic pace.
   Two new issues totaling $1.39 billion were priced
yesterday, on the heels of nearly $4 billion of new
asset-backed securities last week.
   The offerings are a $997 million Household Finance Corp.
deal backed by home-equity loans and a $397 million Norwest
Bank Minnesota issue backed by retail installment sales
contracts and installment loans secured by new and used autos
and light trucks. Household Finance, a consumer and
commercial financing concern, is a unit of Household
International Inc., and Norwest Bank is a unit of Norwest
Corp.
   Both were priced by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   The Household Finance offering is in three classes, with
initial rates ranging from 8.525% to 8.875%.
   In the Norwest deal, the offering has a coupon rate of
9.20%, priced at 99 27/32 to yield 9.217%.
   In other primary market activity, the Federal National
Mortgage Association announced that it priced a $500 million
real estate mortgage investment conduit offering, backed by
Fannie Mae 9.5% securities, through Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   In secondary activity, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% securities for July delivery were up 6/32 at
98 25/32 to yield 9.81%. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
9.5% securities were up 5/ 32 at 98 1/8 and Fannie Mae 9.5%
securities were up 5/32 at 98 5/8.
                                                                                                       

   Junk, Corporate Securities
                                                                                                       

   The junk bonds of three casinos operated by real estate
developer Donald Trump rose on news that Mr. Trump's secured
$20 million in temporary financing just in time to enable him
to meet a midnight deadline on $43 million in bond payments.
   Trump Castle Funding's 13.75% first mortgage bonds ended
at 58, up 2 points from Monday. Trump Taj Mahal Funding Inc.
14% bonds closed at 50 1/4, up 1 point, while Trump Plaza
Funding Inc.'s 12 7/8% bonds finished at 84, up 2 points.
   Before today, Donald Trump had already repurchased nearly
$23 million of his Trump Castle 13.75% first mortgage bonds
to meet sinking fund payments on the issue.
   According to a June 15 filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Mr. Trump and his partnership purchased
about $22.7 million principal amount of Trump Castle's 13.75%
bonds before June 15. The filing said the purchase may be
applied against the $22.7 million principal payment that was
due June 15.
   The $43 million in debt payments that Trump owes includes
the almost $23 million required for the sinking fund payment
on the Trump Castle 13.75% bond issue.
   Junk bond dealers said trading in the Trump bonds was
modest yesterday, with most of the buying spurred by dealers
seeking to cover short positions. Many dealers had been
shorting Trump bonds and driving down the prices by betting
that Mr. Trump would default on the bonds.
   Despite the positive news, junk bond traders said the
spread between the bid and offered prices remains wide,
suggesting that the market is still uncertain about the
casinos' future.
   In the broader market, most junk bonds, or
speculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or no
credit ratings at all, finished between 1/4 and 1/2 point
lower. By comparison, high-grade corporate bonds gained 1/8
point on average.
   Meanwhile, in the new-issue market for investment-grade
corporate debt, Dayton-Hudson Corp. offered $400 million in
debt securities. The two-part issue consisted of $200 million
of 12-year notes priced to yield 9.75% and $200 million of
30-year debentures priced to yield 9.98%.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 15/32,
up from 101 31/32 on Monday. The latest ten-year notes ended
at a price of 102 5/32 to yield 8.53% compared with 101 25/32
to yield 8.58%.
   Short-term rates were slightly higher when compared with
the average rates set at Monday's Treasury bill auction. The
discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.80%
for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.05% while the rate on
six-month bills ended at about 7.70% for a bond-equivalent
yield of 8.10%.
   Here are details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

   The notes are dated July 2 and mature June 30, 1992.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Canadian bond prices rose sharply in moderate trading as
institutional investors piled back into the market on the
heels of a sharply higher Canadian dollar.
   Traders said participants regained confidence in Canada
after bond prices and the Canadian dollar failed Monday to
show significant negative reaction to the weekend demise of
the Meech Lake constitutional accord.
   "Investors are putting the political developments aside,"
for now "and are starting to focus on the Canadian economy
again," said Alberto Franco, head of the Canadian government
trading desk at Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Mr. Franco said there is a growing perception among
investors that the Canadian dollar is strong enough to
provide room for the Bank of Canada to ease short-term
interest rates without weakening the value of the Canadian
currency. That's good for bonds, of course, because falling
interest rates lead to higher bond prices.
   Traders said the 10-year benchmark 10.5% Canadian bond due
July 2000 rose 1 1/8 point yesterday to close at 98 5/8 to
yield 10.72%.
   The Meech Lake accord, designed to meet Quebec's demand
that it be considered a "distinct society" and to defuse
independence forces within the mostly French-speaking
province, died after two provinces failed to ratify it by a
Saturday deadline.
   "There is some political risk (remaining because of the
failure of Meech Lake). But I guess people have realized they
overestimated the political risk," said Dan Aitchison, a
trader at Citibank Canada. "A lot of people were shorting
Canada expecting the worst."
   Elsewhere:
   -- British government bonds, called gilts, recovered from
earlier declines as sterling rose to a nine-month high. Among
benchmarks, the 11.75% bond due 2003/ 2007 rose 1/2 point to
103 19/32 to yield 11.21% while the 12% notes due 1995 rose
6/32 to 100 17/32 to yield 11.85%. On foreign exchanges, the
pound was quoted late in London at $1.7360, up from $1.7315.
   -- The West German bond market was pulled higher on the
strength of the U.S. and British bond markets. Bonn's 8.75%
bond due 2000 rose 0.39 point to 100.35 to yield 8.69%.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Tax-exempt issues ended steady to 1/8 point higher in
light dealings.
   In new issue activity, market participants are expecting a
repricing of $785 million New York State Dormitory Authority
City University System consolidated second general resolution
revenue bonds to lower yields because of the strong investor
interest shown in the deal.
   As preliminarily priced, the New York State Dormitory
Authority bonds were priced to yield from 6.50% in 1992 to
7.65% in 2016.
   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 were unchanged at 97 5/8
to yield 7.39% pc.

   BUENOS AIRES -- Telefonica de Espana S.A. and Bell
Atlantic Corp. of the U.S. probably won the bidding for the
state telephone company Empresa Nacional de
Telecommunicaciones, or Entel, newspapers reported Tuesday.
   The bids were opened Monday and the winners will be
announced Thursday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the privatization plan, Entel is being broken into
two companies, one covering the northern half of Argentina
and one the southern half. The government is selling 60% of
each company. Telefonica, Spain's state-controlled
telecommunications monopoly, submitted the highest bids for
both companies, the Public Works Ministry confirmed.
   But after Telefonica chose the southern Entel company,
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic raised its bid slightly for
the northern firm, as allowed in the bidding terms.
   In all, the 60% of the two Entel concerns that was sold
fetched $214 million in cash, as well as obligations to
assume $5 billion in debt and accompanying interest payments,
and to pay an additional $379 million in cash over six years.
   Shares in the two new companies amounting to 10% will be
given to employees. The remaining 30% will be offered on the
Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.

   Precious metals futures gave up most of Monday's price
gains.
   August gold closed at $352.90, off $3.30 an ounce. July
silver settled at $4.8250 an ounce, down 0.3 cent. October
platinum settled at $485.70 an ounce, down $1.90.

   Prices were boosted Monday by news that South Africa's
central bank has been intervening to support the gold market.
   Yesterday, silver performed relatively better than gold or
platinum, according to Don Tierney, metals analyst at Stanley
B. Bell &amp; Co. in New York, because some precious metals
traders decided silver was a buy. But July silver had to fall
below its 12 1/2-year low of $4.7620 -- the contract traded
as low as $4.7350 -- before buying developed.
   "I can't believe this silver price -- it just seems so
attractive, especially when you realize that the last time it
was in this area was in December 1977," Mr. Tierney said.
   Mr. Bell said many metals traders are turning from gold to
silver because they are tired of getting slammed in the
overnight gold market. "Three times in the last few months
they have awakened to the news that gold is down anywhere
from $6 to $20 an ounce," he said.
   Mr. Bell pointed out that the number of gold contracts
remaining to be nullified by opposite trades or fulfilled by
delivery of the metal is only 9,000 more than in silver,
narrowed from a differential of 40,000 contracts a month ago.
He said he expects ultimately to see this so-called open
interest in silver exceed that in gold when the commodity
funds that are holding large short positions take their
profits in gold. "I expect them to roll out of gold and into
the silver market," he said.
   Larry Heim, publisher of the Heim Investment Letter in
Portland, Ore., said yesterday's action in the silver market
was positive.
   "The move to under $4.76 cleaned out all the stop-loss
orders that might have been placed by not-very-determined"
buyers, he said. Such price action, he said, bodes well for a
possible short-term turnaround in silver prices and perhaps
even a major move higher.
   William O'Neill, futures analyst at Merrill Lynch Futures
in New York, said the focus in the gold market now is on cash
bullion. He said the sell-off in gold would have been worse
if the dollar hadn't eased in the afternoon; gold and the
dollar typically move in opposite directions.
   As for gold-producing countries supporting gold prices,
Mr. O'Neill said: "It would be naive to expect South Africa
or the Soviet Union to engage in any long-term campaign to
support gold. These countries are so currency-starved that
long-range support is out of the question."
   But although ultimately their need to sell the metal will
far outweigh any support they can possibly give the market,
he said, such producer intervention probably did help to halt
the market's slide temporarily.
   However, Mr. O'Neill said, the market is still in an
erosion mode. "On rallies we have lower highs and on
sell-offs lower lows," he said. He said the one bright spot
has been some investment buying from the Far East, but in
general, investment buying has been absent.
   Platinum seems to be in a bullish supply/demand situation,
according to Mr. O'Neill, but it can't rally independently of
gold.
   He said he is considering a "spread" trade in which he
would buy two October platinum contracts and sell one October
gold contract to act on his expectation of platinum
outperforming gold. But he said he won't initiate this trade
until the price premium of platinum over gold narrows to
about $115 a ounce from $126 currently.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices closed mixed in relatively
subdued trading. Soybean and corn futures for July delivery
closed slightly lower, reflecting many traders' belief that
Monday's rally wasn't totally supported by forecasts of hot
weather spreading across Midwestern growing areas this week,
said Steven Freed, a futures analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. Short-covering by commodity funds,
or the buying of contracts to offset those sold earlier in
anticipation of continued price declines, accounted for a
significant portion of the Monday rally, Mr. Freed said. July
soybean futures closed 4.75 cents a bushel lower at $6.08 a
bushel after gaining 13.25 cents a bushel Monday. July corn
futures slipped 1.25 cents to close at $2.8575 a bushel after
a five-cent gain Monday. Wheat futures for July delivery on
the Chicago Board of Trade bucked the trend and gained half a
cent a bushel to close at $3.34. Analysts said that corn and
soybean prices are likely to rise and fall in step with
Midwestern temperatures for the next several weeks.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices drifted lower in
extremely light trading. The New York Mercantile Exchange
estimated volume at only about 54,000 contracts, resulting in
a sluggish session as traders apparently decided to hold
tight ahead of the weekly report of U.S. petroleum
inventories due from the American Petroleum Institute late
yesterday. The August crude contract lost 24 cents a barrel
to close at $17.14. Later months were lower as well. Even
gasoline, which in recent sessions has seemed immune to
crude's declines, fell. July unleaded gasoline contracts lost
0.95 cents a gallon to end the session at 61.32 cents.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Prices drifted lower in a continuation of Monday's
sell-off. The July contract settled at $1.0835 a pound, down
0.55 cent. Release of a London Metal Exchange report showing
supplies down 375 metric tons was a non-event, analysts said.
Stocks at New York's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose 1,140
tons to 18,801 tons. Mr. O'Neill of Merrill Lynch noted that
in London the premium of spot copper over metal to be
delivered in three months is now $16 a metric ton, narrowed
from $50 a few months ago. The narrowing "reflects that the
demand for immediate copper is falling," Mr. O'Neill said, as
well as indicating heavy selling by copper merchants. Mr.
O'Neill said the copper market is drifting because there are
few reports due out this week. He added: "Though the mid-June
car sales were not good, I didn't think they were all that
bad. I think we may be near a bottom for those numbers."
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Prices continued fluctuating wildly. The old-crop
July contract settled at 86.31 cents a pound, up 1.54 cents,
while the new-crop December contract fell 0.30 cent to close
at 74.25 cents. Ernest Simon, cotton specialist at
Prudential-Bache Securities in New York, said there still
isn't much cotton from last year's crop available for
delivery. "Tuesday was the second day in which sellers could
give notice that they intend to deliver cotton," he said. "So
far, there have been no delivery notices." He said the July
contract is being driven up by traders who have sold
contracts in anticipation of lower prices and now must go
into the market to buy the contracts back. A few holders of
long positions in the July contract, he said, are probably
foreign countries who want cotton to meet current needs and
are holding onto their contracts until some short-seller
delivers physical cotton to them. However, he said, even the
rally in new-crop cotton has been explosive. "Seven times in
June the new-crop month of December has made new contract
highs," he said, attributing the rally mainly to hot and dry
weather in Texas. "Weather in other cotton-growing regions
has been good, with the crop coming along nicely," according
to Mr. Simon. He said the market is also being propelled
upward by commodity funds that use trend-following techniques
and buy a commodity when certain technical indicators show
prices to be in a general uptrend.

   Stocks Ease After End of Rally
   Prompted by Deficit-Cutting Talk

   NEW YORK -- An early rally inspired by deficit-reduction
talk gave way to earnings worries yesterday, and stocks
closed slightly lower.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.72 points to
2842.33.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stock and bond prices rallied sharply yesterday morning
after it was reported that President Bush said tax revenue
increases would have to be part of any "responsible"
deficit-reduction effort. The industrial average jumped about
30 points in early trading, but the rally quickly faded as
earnings concerns began to dominate the market again.
   Caterpillar, which fell 5 Monday on a statement from the
company about its earnings outlook, tumbled another 6 to 52
1/2 on huge volume of nearly five million shares. Corning
said earnings for its fiscal second quarter fell to 71 cents
a share from 76 cents a year earlier, and the stock fell 2
1/8 to 43 7/8.
   L.A. Gear, which is expected to announce earnings today
after the market's close, fell 1 3/8 to 26 1/8. Earlier this
month, L.A. Gear said it expected earnings for the second
fiscal quarter, ended May 31, to be about 50 to 60 cents a
share against 91 cents a year earlier.
   Investors don't see signs of strong consumer spending, and
that's one reason why shares of retailers are weak. Wal-Mart
slipped 5/8 to 59 1/2. Investors are also losing faith in
some cyclical stocks whose fortunes are tied to the economy.
   Dow Chemical fell 1 1/2 to 57 3/8 with 1.3 million shares
changing hands. Shearson Lehman and Goldman Sachs both
lowered estimates of the company's earnings for the second
quarter and the year; also, Oppenheimer &amp; Co. recommended
that investors avoid the stock, based on its belief that
earnings may stay in a downward trend over the next 12 to 15
months.
   "The scary thing is that (bad earnings news) is running
across industries," said Leo Grohowski, director of
Marinvest's stock investments. "People are asking, where is
the strength in the domestic economy?" Mr. Grohowski said
investors are now buying defensive issues "where there is a
high degree of confidence that earnings will be good," even
though many of these issues are expensive.
   The divergence between cyclical and defensive issues was
in evidence among the stocks in the Dow industrials. While
General Motors fell 1 to 46 7/8 on 1.2 million shares and
Aluminum Co. of America lost 7/8 to 63 7/8, Philip Morris
rose 1/4 to 46 7/8 on 2.5 million shares, Coca-Cola Co. rose
3/8 to 43 1/4 and Merck added 5/8 to 82 7/8.
   Other drug stocks generally rallied along with Merck, but
there was one notable exception: Pfizer, which fell 1 1/8 to
62 3/8. PaineWebber analyst Ronald Nordmann estimated that
Pfizer's second-quarter earnings will be "no better than 85
to 90 cents a share, and could be lower." The company posted
net income of 80 cents a share in the year-ago period.
   Mr. Nordmann also said he sees the potential for favorable
second-quarter earnings surprises from Warner-Lambert, which
gained 3/8 to 62 1/4, and Eli Lilly, which added 1/8 to 79
3/8. Among other drug stocks, Johnson &amp; Johnson rose 1/8 to
64 7/8; Dean Witter Reynolds added the stock to its list of
recommended issues.
   Selling spilled into heavy-machinery stocks. Deere dropped
1 1/4 to 69 1/2, Clark Equipment fell 1 3/4 to 39 1/4 and
Nacco Industries lost 1 1/2 to 59 1/2.
   Continental Bank, which said it expects to post a
second-quarter loss, fell 5/8 to 15 3/8. The company noted
that the loss would reflect a pretax reserve of $50 million
to cover costs of a plan to eliminate certain product lines
and reduce its staff by about 900 employees.
   The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 12.07 to 1135.77
-- its ninth loss in the past 10 sessions -- as the airline
group was hit with selling. UAL, which owns United Airlines,
slid 5 to 147; AMR, the parent of American Airlines, fell 1/2
to 62 7/8; Delta Air Lines dropped 3/4 to 73, and USAir Group
fell 1/4 to 25 7/8.
   Gulf States Utilities rose 1 to 11 1/8 after agreeing in
principle to a $300 million settlement of a dispute with
Southern Co. over power sales contracts. In response,
Standard &amp; Poor's upgraded its ratings on Gulf States' debt
issues; the agency said the proposed settlement "removes
considerable uncertainty surrounding credit quality" at the
utility. Southern gained 3/8 to 25.
   Unisys lost 1/2 to 13 1/8. The company agreed to sell $150
million of convertible preferred stock to Mitsui &amp; Co. of
Japan through a private placement. The accord also calls for
Mitsui to provide Unisys with a five-year, $50 million loan.
   American International Group, which agreed to acquire
International Lease Finance for cash and stock valued at
$1.38 billion, tumbled 2 5/8 to 94. International Lease
advanced 3 7/8 to 31 in over-the-counter trading.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.59
to 356.80. Volume totaled 10,540,000 shares.

   Over-the-counter stocks faded after a fast start off the
blocks.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.26 to 455.38, a 0.06%
slide. The OTC market opened two points higher and reached a
high of 458.04 at midmorning before starting to drift lower.
Volume rose to 131.6 million from 113.5 million Monday.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing stocks by 975 to 889.

   "We saw huge buyers on the opening" among larger,
institutional investors, said Nicholas Karos, senior OTC
trader at Piper Jaffray Hopwood in Minneapolis, but they
became scarcer as the day progressed.
   "They couldn't seem to hold the rally," said Robert
Antolini, head of OTC trading at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
Mr. Antolini said the tone among OTC stocks was "generally
weak," adding that he saw a number of institutions willing to
sell stock.
   Cellular stocks were weak in the wake of Motorola's
announcement that it plans to introduce a universal cellular
phone system that could undercut their exclusive territories,
Mr. Antolini noted. Among cellular issues, McCaw Cellular
Class A shares fell 1/2 to 25 3/4 on nearly 1.3 million
shares; Contel Cellular Class A shares dropped 1/4 to 18 3/4,
and Vanguard Cellular eased 1/2 to 25.
   International Lease Finance surged 3 7/8 to 31 and was the
most-active stock with nearly 5.9 million shares changing
hands. The Beverly Hills, Calif., remarketer of jetliners
agreed to be acquired by American International Group of New
York in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at about $1.3
billion.
   Two new issues also were well received and among the day's
most-active stocks. Shares of Arctco Inc., a snowmobile maker
based in Thief River Falls, Minn., rose 5/8 to 11 5/8 after
an initial public offering yesterday of 3.2 million shares
priced at $11 each.
   AICorp rose 1 3/8 to 10 7/8. The Waltham, Mass., developer
of computer-aided software engineering products offered 2.25
million shares in an initial public offering priced at $9.50
apiece.
   Adobe Systems slid 1 3/4 to 35 and was among the day's
most active stocks. The Mountain View, Calif., software maker
reported that net income for the second quarter ended June 1
edged up to 36 cents a share from 35 cents a year earlier.
   Other technology shares were mixed. Apple Computer eased
5/8 to 49 5/8; Intel was unchanged at 45 1/2, and Oracle
Systems dropped 3/4 to 21 5/8. Microsoft rose 1/4 to 74 3/4.
   MCI Communications added 1/2 to 40 1/8. The Washington,
D.C., long-distance carrier said it signed a loan agreement
for up to $1 billion with a group of 22 banks to finance its
$1.25-billion acquisition of Atlanta-based Telecom USA, the
nation's fourth-largest long-distance carrier. Separately,
Citibank said it will provide its 14.6 million Visa
cardholders with a long-distance telephone service offered
through MCI.
   SciMed Life Systems jumped 2 1/8 to 35 1/8 after the
Minneapolis maker of cardiovascular medical products reported
late Monday that net income for the first quarter ended May
31 rose to 45 cents a share from 20 cents a year earlier.
   "They produced more earnings in this quarter than they did
in all of 1989," when SciMed earned 33 cents a share,
Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Kurt Kruger said in an interview.
SciMed's strong performance prompted him to repeat a "strong
buy" opinion on the stock and raise his earnings estimate for
fiscal 1991 ending in February to $2 a share, compared with
profit $1.29 a share in fiscal 1990.
   SciMed now has a firm hold as the second-largest producer
of angioplasty catheters used in heart surgery, Mr. Kruger
noted, with C.R. Bard falling to a distant third after that
company withdrew several products from the market. "I think
SciMed will, in the next decade, become a major-league
cardiovascular products company," the analyst said.
   Fortune Financial jumped 1 3/4 to 13. A group that
includes the Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corp. and currently holds a
9.97% position in the Clearwater, Fla., thrift said the U.S.
Office of Thrift Supervision gave it clearance to buy up to
20% of Fortune Financial's common shares.
   Fiserv leaped 2 1/8 to 29 7/8 after American Banker, a
banking trade newspaper, reported that Electronic Data
Systems is considering buying the West Allis, Wis., data
processor for thrifts. Last week, Fiserv announced it had
preliminary talks with an unidentified company about a
possible business combination.
   Officials of both companies declined to confirm or deny
the report, according to Dow Jones Professional Report.
Johnston, Lemon &amp; Co. analyst Jordan Cox told DJPIR that
Electronic Data is the only possible acquirer that owns a
similar service as Fiserv's.
   Martin Lawrence Ltd. Editions plunged 2 1/8 to 4 1/2 after
the Van Nuys, Calif., artworks publisher said it expects to
report second-quarter net income of six to 10 cents a share,
down sharply from 24 cents a year earlier. The company said
sales for the second quarter will be down about 12% to 17%
from a year earlier, citing a slowdown in the art market and
a continuing decline in overall consumer retail spending.
   Cenvest tumbled 1 1/4 to 4 3/4. The Meriden, Conn., bank
said it expects to report a second-quarter loss and will
suspend its 12-cents a share dividend for the second-quarter
after taking a special provision of about $13.2 million in
June for loan-loss reserves. Citing continued weakness in the
Connecticut real estate market, Cenvest said it is
recognizing loan losses of $4.5 million from its current
reserves.
   Aequitron Medical slid 3/15 to 2 1/8 after the Minneapolis
medical-device company said it is recalling thousands of
machines used primarily to monitor infants' respiration and
heart rates to repair faulty alarm systems.

   There's No Pro-Choice Majority Either

SUPREME COURT (SUP)

   The analysts who so hotly debated the nuances of the murky
abortion decision that the Supreme Court handed down Monday
seem to lose that subtlety when they confront the abortion
views of the American public. In the seven months since
pro-choice candidates defeated their pro-life opponents in
Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races, columnists from
coast to coast have cited the pro-choice "majority" as though
the matter is settled. National Abortion Rights Action League
executive director Kate Michelman coined the conventional
wisdom in the wake of last year's pro-choice election
victories: "If you're out of touch with the pro-choice
majority, you're out of office."
   That's a nice soundbite, but surveys show public opinion
is considerably more complex and ambivalent, not just on the
morality of abortion, but on its legality as well. A
two-thirds "pro-choice majority" can be shown to exist only
when abortion is framed broadly as an issue of personal
freedom.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When asked whether abortion should be allowed by law in
various specific circumstances, a majority of Americans says
that in many cases it should not be. And the cases where
Americans would restrict abortion -- when the woman's chief
reason for abortion is that the potential child would grow up
without its father, or that it would strain the woman's
financial resources, or disrupt her career, education or
relationship with the father -- comprise the vast majority of
abortions that are performed in the U.S.
   In June 1989, shortly before the Supreme Court's
restrictive decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health
Services, a CBS/New York Times survey asked whether abortion
should be "legal as it is now," legal only in extreme cases
(rape, incest or threat to the life of the woman) or entirely
illegal. Some 45% of the adults interviewed favored the
status quo, but 39% favored allowing abortion only in the
extreme cases and another 12% favored outlawing it
altogether.
   That 51% majority for sharp restrictions dropped by three
points in a post Webster survey of the same respondents a
month later, creating a 48-48 split between those who favored
the status quo and those who favored restrictions. In its
written analysis of the poll, CBS heralded similarly
near-equal splits on two other questions about abortion as
"evidence of movement towards a more pro-choice consensus."
But this "consensus" proved short-lived: The percentage
favoring sharp restrictions bounced back to a 53-43 advantage
in a CBS/Times poll two months later.
   The most specific questions about abortion have been put
in a series of surveys by KRC Communications Research, which
polls for the Boston Globe and the San Francisco Examiner. In
a KRC survey last year, before Webster, majorities said that
abortion should not be legal in cases where the grounds for
it are economic or emotional strain, an uncooperative or
absent father or the woman's sense that it is the wrong time
in her life to have a child. Five months after Webster, KRC
found a rise in pro-choice sentiment. A bare plurality
(statistically a tie) now favored legal abortion when the
woman's reason was that she could not afford to bear a child,
but majorities still opposed it when the grounds cited were
the father's absence or unwillingness to help raise the
child.
   Pennsylvania and Idaho, the two states whose legislatures
passed extensive abortion restrictions in the wake of Webster
(Idaho's legislation was vetoed by Gov. Cecil Andrus), have
been depicted in the media as exceptional pro-life bastions.
But last December, when KRC asked voters across the country
whether they would like their states to adopt laws similar to
Pennsylvania's, an overwhelming majority said yes. This year,
KRC found that 48% of Americans would approve of their state
adopting a law similar to the Idaho bill that "outlaws
abortion except in the cases of rape, incest, profound fetal
deformity or if the life of the mother is threatened," while
only 43% would oppose it.
   The point is not that there is a pro-life majority. That
conclusion would be no more accurate than the converse.
Indeed, when confronted with KRC's national finding on the
Idaho restrictions, pro-choice activists rightly noted that
if the phrasing of the question were changed, the results
would probably change as well.
   Perhaps the most revealing approach is to let people state
their views on abortion in their own words. Just after
Webster was handed down, American Viewpoint, a Republican
polling company, asked voters to name "the one thing you
would like your state representative to keep in mind when
discussing and voting on" abortion. The most frequently cited
theme in the responses was a woman's right to choose,
mentioned by 36%. Overall, 54% offered pro-choice answers.
But the share of respondents who gave one anti-abortion
response or another, plus those who stressed that abortion
should be legal only in certain cases, totaled 48%. (The
total exceeded 100% because some responses covered two
themes.)
   Linda DiVall, who directed the American Viewpoint survey,
noted that pro-choice sentiment formed a large, ready-made
bloc, while the anti-abortion responses were diffuse. Pulling
the latter group together while minimizing the focused
hostility of the former group is no doubt an uphill battle
for a pro-life candidate. But if a pro-life candidate could
hold all his potential supporters together, the voters would
apparently split almost evenly. This is why pro-choice
activists avoid debating specific restrictions, according to
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who works for pro-choice
groups.
   Pro-choicers who resist acknowledging voters' ambivalence
should be reminded that one-dimensional images of public
opinion hurt their cause too. Consider: The abortion
restrictions most likely to be approved by state legislatures
in the wake of Webster are not outright bans, but tighter
regulation of abortion clinics. The media have widely
reported polls that purport to show that large majorities
would favor laws to require parental consent, viability
testing, a pre-abortion waiting period and a full briefing of
the woman on options other than abortion. But last July CBS
found that when these restrictions are described collectively
-- as "laws that would make it difficult for private clinics
to perform abortions" -- a majority opposes them. Isn't the
latter finding as significant as the former?
   Rather than discrediting each other, these snapshots of
public opinion, taken from different angles, can combine to
flesh out a multidimensional image of public opinion. Recent
CBS polls illustrate this nicely. Last fall nearly 70% of
adults agreed with the statement, "even in cases where I
might think abortion is the wrong thing to do, I don't think
the government has any business preventing a woman from
having an abortion." In the same survey, a bare 48% plurality
agreed that "abortion should be available for those who
really want it, but it should not be easy to get." In
November, when asked which of three statements best expressed
their views, 41% chose to say abortion should be "generally
available," and an opposite 15% felt it "should not be
permitted," but 42% chose positions favoring legal abortion
with "stricter limits" than the status quo.
   The result is a triply qualified hypothesis: Two-thirds of
Americans believe abortion generally should be decided by the
woman, but most think it should not be allowed in the less
severe circumstances; and despite widespread reluctance to
enforce the law in such cases, about half want barriers to
discourage women whose motives are less than compelling.
That's a lousy soundbite, but a good stab at what the public
really thinks.

   When Hilmar Kopper joined leading world bankers at the
International Monetary Conference in San Francisco this
month, he quipped: If Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
shows up and "passes the hat, I'm going to sneak out of the
room."
   The head of West Germany's Deutsche Bank AG was just
kidding. But his comment reflects the deep-seated reluctance
of the world's major commercial banks to finance the
reconstruction of the ravaged economies of the Soviet Union
and its former satellites.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The banks don't mind lending money when Western
governments guarantee they won't lose anything. One such loan
is the planned five billion mark ($2.98 billion) credit to
the Soviet Union by West German banks and guaranteed by Bonn.
   But as for doing it alone, bankers say the costs of
rebuilding East Europe are too high, the political situations
too uncertain and many of the economies too badly damaged by
decades of communist-led centralized management. They say
they learned an expensive lesson in lending billions to Latin
American and other Third World countries, much of which may
never be repaid.
   Bankers sympathize with the plight of emerging democracies
in Eastern Europe and the stated desire of many of them to
adopt free-market mechanisms. But they say the new
governments are going to have to look elsewhere for the large
sums needed to finance projects and trade gaps.
   "Balance of payments financing isn't the job of commercial
banks," said Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse. "There
have to be other means to take care of that, whether it be
government or institutions like the International Monetary
Fund."
   Forty-two nations recently pledged about $12 billion to
the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
which will lend to emerging market economies in Eastern
Europe. European Community leaders meeting in Dublin this
week agreed to start working on an aid package to help
revitalize the Soviet economy. Next month, major industrial
countries led by Europe will discuss a multibillion-dollar
credit for the Soviet Union. And several governments have
pledged aid such as export credits.
   But analysts conceded that these sums are minuscule
compared with the daunting tasks East European countries face
in transforming their inefficient economies, modernizing
industrial plants and alleviating enormous pollution
problems.
   "We have no successful examples of a fast leap from
controlled, centrally planned economies to successful,
self-sustaining market-oriented societies enjoying growth and
stability -- certainly not at the rate of speed that may be
necessary to satisfy the aspirations of the people of Eastern
Europe or the U.S.S.R. or China," said Paul Volcker, former
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and chairman of James
D. Wolfensohn Inc., a New York investment banking boutique.
   Many analysts also worry that the pain involved in
switching to market-based economies -- soaring prices, closed
factories, rising unemployment and lower standards of living
-- will lead to frustrated populations and political
instability. Several Eastern countries also have large
foreign debt burdens.
   It will be years before free-market principles fully take
hold "and it will be a painful process as has already been
seen in Poland," said Mr. Kopper of Deutsche Bank.
   Rifts are growing within Poland's Solidarity movement
following the government's recent decision to adopt drastic
austerity measures. Debates still exist within the Hungarian
and Czechoslovakian governments over the degree and pace of
economic change.
   In Bulgaria and Romania, opposition groups protest the
legitimacy of governments that include many former
communists. And Nigel Lawson, former British Chancellor of
the Exchequer, told the bankers in San Francisco that the
Soviet Union was "a political and economic disaster zone."
   An exception to this negative prognosis is East Germany,
mainly because it has a big sugar daddy: West Germany.
   Some bankers bridle at the lax approach Western
governments have taken toward Latin American nations that
don't repay their bank debt. They argue that this only
discourages banks from making loans to borrowers in Eastern
Europe.
   "The thing we can't take is behavioral risk: the ability
of a borrower to say for his own reasons: `Hey, we don't want
to pay back,'" said John Reed, chairman of Citicorp. "We find
a situation that I think is unique historically: where the
G-7, who are the custodians of the world economy, viewed a
situation where a country not wanting to pay its debts as a
perfectly OK thing." The G-7, or Group of Seven, includes the
U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   Noting that "no one seems to care" that Brazil, with about
$10 billion of reserves and good exports, is in arrears to
bank lenders, Mr. Reed said: "How can we have a cross-border
debt to Poland if a {Western} politician says the next day:
`You don't have to pay it off?'"

   Study Showing High U.S. Murder Rate
   For Young Men Highlights Health Issue
   ----

   A new study bolsters the growing belief that the nation's
high homicide rate among young men -- particularly blacks --
isn't only a crime concern but a major public health problem
as well.
   Researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said
the murder rate among U.S. males from 15 to 24 years old is
more than four times higher than any other developed country,
and more than 40 times higher than in Japan and Austria.
Moreover, the homicide rate among young black men in the U.S.
is seven times higher than for young white males, and was 39%
higher in 1987 than it was in 1984.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both the high U.S. homicide rate and the vulnerability of
young blacks are well established, but the wide differences
depicted in the study contribute to a growing urgency among
policy makers to develop strategies to address the problem.
   "Looking at all the {data} together, they present a
startling picture that we can't afford" to ignore, says Lois
A. Fingerhut, a statistician with the CDC's National Center
for Health Statistics and lead author of the report.
"Innovative public health strategies must be developed to
reduce this loss of our nation's youth," she and co-author
Joel C. Kleinman say in the study, which is published in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Last fall, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan described the homicide rate among youth as a major
public health problem -- echoing previous federal efforts to
reduce the rate among young blacks. Earlier this year,
doctors from Harlem Hospital in New York City published a
report in the New England Journal of Medicine saying that
life expectancy among black men in Harlem was lower than that
of men in Bangladesh.
   The homicide study, Ms. Fingerhut says, argues for
thinking about the problem much the way public agencies
approach infectious diseases. The homicide rate "is a problem
we have to solve. It doesn't have to be a fact of life."
   The study compares the U.S. homicide rate in 1987 among
males from 15 to 24 years old with those in 21 other
developed countries. It also ranks murder rates in selected
states for blacks and whites in that age group.
   More than 4,000 of these young men were murdered in the
U.S. in 1987, the authors say, for an overall homicide rate
of 21.9 per 100,000 population. The next highest country was
Scotland, where the rate was 5.0. In Japan, just one in
200,000 young men was murdered in 1987, according to the
report.
   Particularly startling, however, were the wide differences
within the U.S. The homicide rate among young blacks is 85.6
per 100,000, while among whites it is 11.2. The rate among
blacks in the age group was highest in Michigan at 231.6 per
100,000. For whites, the rate was highest in California at 22
per 100,000.
   "The overall differences {between blacks and whites} are
phenomenal," Ms. Fingerhut says. "They're beyond staggering."
   The authors also cite FBI reports noting that the majority
of homicides in the U.S. involve victims and offenders of the
same race and who knew each other. Some 90% of black male
victims were killed by blacks, while 87% of white male
victims were murdered by whites, the study says.
   This suggests that a plan to reduce homicides should focus
on programs to teach young people to solve personal conflicts
without violence, the authors say.
   The study is also likely to fuel the continuing debate
over gun control in the U.S. -- 75% of murders in the U.S. in
1987 were committed with a firearm while less than a quarter
of the homicides in 21 other countries were gun-related. To
alleviate the problem, Ms. Fingerhut adds: "We clearly have
to look at the issue of firearms availability."

   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- Nynex Corp. said it was awarded
three cable-television franchises in the U.K. that represent
a potential total of 219,000 households and 10,800
businesses.
   Nynex, which got a relatively late start in competing for
U.K. cable properties, applied for a total of 23 franchise
licenses. Many of the choicest properties, including those
for metropolitan London and Birmingham, were grabbed early by
such rivals as Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. Only
four franchises remain to be assigned, and Nynex is bidding
for all of them.

   In its announcement yesterday, Nynex said it was awarded
rights with its partner, Britannia Cablesystems Group Ltd.,
for the cable-TV franchise to serve England's Darlington
district, representing a market with about 34,000 homes and
1,800 businesses.
   In addition, Nynex and Britannia won a pair of franchises
to serve a total of 24 small adjacent Surrey communities
south of London. These franchises represent about 185,000
residences and about 9,000 businesses.
   Nynex, already a participant in three other successful
U.K. cable applications in the U.K., said its goal is to
attain 1.2 million potential cable and telephone customers
there. A Nynex official said the company expects to invest
about $160 million over the next six years to develop those
cable businesses.
   Britannia is a partnership of several individual investors
in the U.S. and the U.K. with interests in cable-TV
operations and television programming.
   Separately, Nynex disclosed that it was awarded two
contracts, valued at a total of $2 million, by Philippines
Long Distance Telephone Co. to provide certain
project-management services for at least three years.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Nynex shares closed at $82.25, up 12.5 cents.

   Raycomm Expects
   To Report a Profit
   For Fiscal Year 1990

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)

<LP>
   FREEHOLD, N.J. -- Raycomm Transworld Industries Inc.
expects to report break-even results for the fourth quarter
ended March 31 and a $730,000 profit for the year, compared
with net losses in both year-earlier periods.
   The fiscal fourth quarter is usually the weakest for
Raycomm, when the temporary-help concern pays higher payroll
taxes; the levies are higher early in the calendar year and
decline as the year goes on, said Robert Fain, president and
chief executive officer, in an interview.

   But by slashing overhead, reducing corporate staff and
focusing on a core business -- placing technical personnel in
the aerospace, defense and electronics industries -- the
company was able to bring its net worth to about a positive
$766,000 at fiscal year's end from a negative $1.3 million a
year earlier, Mr. Fain said in an interview.
   The fourth-quarter estimate compares with a year-ago loss
of $575,000, or six cents a share. Raycomm's quarterly
revenue is estimated at $12.5 million to $13 million vs.
$12.8 million, Mr. Fain said.
   For the year, Raycomm's profit estimate equals eight cents
a share, compared with a loss of $2.7 million, or 30 cents a
share, for fiscal 1989. The company estimates that revenue
slipped about 4.4% to $53.5 million from $55.9 million; the
company disposed of two businesses, temporary-help
franchising and nursing placement, during fiscal 1989.
   "We're enjoying a very good {fiscal} first quarter," Mr.
Fain said, and the company projects substantially stronger
results for both the quarter and all of fiscal 1991.
   "The most important thing that could get in the way," he
said, would be a radical cut in defense {spending}, and we
weren't able to replace the business. I don't foresee it, but
it could happen."
