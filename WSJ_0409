   Smog Tax: Dirty Deal
   For Most Consumers

   The oasis of rationality that you find in various
proposals to control air pollution in San Francisco is one
that would reduce smog by taxing it directly ("Paying the
Tailpiper," Review &amp; Outlook, Feb. 28). Presumably your
favored solution to a famine would be to charge a special
levy on food. Those who could not afford the resulting higher
prices would expire, thus neatly solving the problem. You may
not have come to bury San Francisco in ridicule, but if the
solution you advocate is adopted, the rest of the country
will do it for you.
   I am not at all surprised that the scheme is being
promoted by a cabal of local business interests, for it is
replete with all the features that would appeal to such a
group.

<TEXT>
   First, it socks it to consumers rather than business, as
it seeks to reduce pollution by curbing the number of miles
driven, rather than the development of cars that are less
polluting.
   Second, it is designed to be a bonanza for all those
companies that will be selling tuneups, cleaner fuel,
anti-smog devices and replacements for junked old cars, as
consumers struggle to keep the smog tax within the bounds of
what they can afford. If they lose the battle, they will have
to walk or use public transportation.
   Third, those who use employer-provided cars or have the
resources to replace their vehicle every few years (in which
number we should probably count the CEOs of the illustrious
companies you name) will either pass the smog tax on to the
consumer through their product prices, or pay it from their
pocket change. Meanwhile, they will drive by the walkers and
those waiting at the bus stop at 48 mph on properly priced
highways.
   No doubt the proposal would solve the highway and
fresh-air famine, but somehow I prefer a scheme that would
give everyone fair usage of the nation's infrastructural
resources. Even-numbered license plates on the roads on
even-numbered days sounds good to me.

   Economy -- Tracking the Economy:
   Retail Sales Report Expected to Reflect
   Dearth of Discounting on Apparel Lines

   NEW YORK -- Will your Easter bonnet have a discount on it?
   Early reports on March retail sales indicate that
important spring-apparel lines are selling with minimal
markdowns-so far. That's a far cry from the massive
discounting that afflicted inventory-laden retailers at
Christmas and from last year's soft Easter results.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It looks like, at least through March, most retailers
were able to push new merchandise out with normal prices,"
said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu
Economics, New York. Still, he and others concede that the
book on spring merchandise won't be closed until April
results are known, as Easter arrives late this year.
   March retail sales, due out Thursday, are expected to show
a small gain, buoyed by strength in apparel, a high-profit
line for stores, particularly if they maintain full price
markups. A sharp, 3.3% jump in February clothing prices
pushed up the consumer price index that month in a move at
least partly attributable to firmer pricing. Automobile sales
lately have been stirred only by incentives and other
big-ticket goods, such as furniture, have been lifeless. The
week's other indicators include March producer prices and
February business inventories.
   Discounting on Easter goods is still possible. "If they
have a really lousy weekend, retailers may choose to have a
one-day or two-day sale," said Stacy Dutton, retail analyst
at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., New York. She noted Friday that
cold, rainy weather was in the offing for much of the Midwest
and East. "But I don't sense there's a huge panic out there,"
she added.
   Others aren't so sure. "This is a very competitive retail
market with pressures on margins and bargain-conscious
consumers in the stores," said Allen Sinai, chief economist
of Boston Co. "Americans are great mall-walkers, not
necessarily shoppers," he added.
   "Inventories may be lean, but with costs rising on the
wage side, that means profit pressure," Mr. Sinai added,
alluding to Friday's March employment data, which showed
another increase in average hourly earnings.
   Overall March retail sales are expected to rise 0.2%,
according to MMS International Inc., a unit of McGraw-Hill
Inc., New York. Excluding the weak auto component, retail
sales show a larger, 0.4% rise, the survey indicates.
   Discounting may be on the way out as a viable marketing
strategy anyway, said Daniel D. Barry, retail analyst at
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "There is a secular trend toward less
promotion and less discounting and more every-day low
pricing," he said. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. recently made a major
thrust in that direction and Mr. Barry noted that others,
including Dayton-Hudson Corp., are trying the policy. He said
new technology, such as computer-aided inventory control, is
making cost-management easier to achieve at the front of the
selling process, helping retailers avoid disaster sales at
the rack.
   Retailers save by stabilizing their cost-of-carrying goods
and eliminating the often-panicky closeout expenses of a
sale. And the consumer "has the feeling coming into the store
where you can save money on a regular basis rather than
coming in just to buy on sale. There's more good will," said
Mr. Barry.
   Friday's report on February business inventories is
expected to register a flat reading, according to MMS,
corroborating the view that retailer stocks are trim.
   As for consumer pocketbooks, economists said not to expect
much of a clue from Friday's release of March producer
prices. The producer price index is expected to rise 0.1%,
the MMS survey said. Excluding volatile food and energy
components, it's expected to jump 0.3%.
   Economists said the consumer price index, which isn't
reported until next week, could benefit in a backlash from
February's sharp jump in apparel prices as well as from lower
energy prices that weren't fully passed through the previous
month. The early consensus view from MMS pegs the CPI with a
rise of 0.2%. But Midland Montagu's Mr. Fabbri notes that if
the mitigating apparel and energy factors are present,
"there's a real good chance the CPI could be a negative
number."
   Merrill Lynch says in the firm's weekly commentary that
economic activity in the first half now "appears to be
stronger than we originally projected." The firm now expects
first-half real gross national product to grow by about 2.5%.
Treasury bond yields could rise by more than one-quarter of
one percentage point to 9% by the end of the quarter, the
report says. Still, Merrill notes that much of the first-half
growth was due to quirks of nature, statistics and auto
makers. It adds, "The underlying state of the economy remains
soft" and real GNP may rise by only 1.5% by the fourth
quarter.

   Your March 2 story on the nation's air-capacity problem
("FAA Predicts Big Jump in Air Traffic . . .") made an
oblique reference to the airlines blaming part of the problem
on the government's refusal "to get tough with noise
restrictions at individual airports."
   Individual airports have had to implement noise
restrictions because neither the airlines nor the government
has been sensitive to the environmental consequences of
stuffing more routes into the nation's already-saturated
skies. As a result of the airline industry's awesome
political clout and overflowing political-action coffers, it
has been allowed to spread noise and air pollution with
virtually no legislative constraints. Its incestuous
relationship with the FAA is legend, even to the extent that
the last FAA head came from Federal Express.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And the government's typical lack of long-range planning
and political courage is as much to blame. Why, for example,
has the government not invested in a bullet-train system, as
in Japan and Europe? Why isn't the government considering
tougher restrictions on noisier, older, less-safe Stage 2
aircraft, as is being done by the European Economic
Community?
   It is estimated that nine million Americans suffer
intolerable levels of jet noise, and the number is increasing
dramatically each day. In New Jersey alone, where 50% more
routes were added three years ago, more than 4,000 square
miles of land and three million people are being bombarded by
the constant roar of jet aircraft, night after night, day
after day.
   As a business executive who has learned that concern for
the environment is good business, I hope the airline industry
wakes up before it's too late. Deregulation has given the
industry opportunities for growth. With that opportunity
comes social responsibility.

   Drug Makers Will Report 15% Increase
   In First-Quarter Profit, Analysts Predict

<LP>
   The pharmaceutical industry is expected to report profit
growth of about 15% in the first quarter, reflecting
continued strong sales of leading products and the benefits
of a harsh flu season.
   Revenue growth generally was only in the high single
digits, indicating profits are advancing with the help of
cost-cutting and the success of high-margin products,
analysts said. The industry's performance was somewhat
tempered, they added, by comparison with a strong first
quarter a year ago, and by a strong dollar in Japan, an
important market for most major drug companies, particularly
Merck &amp; Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Unfavorable currency translations could depress results
during the rest of the year, especially if the dollar rallies
in Europe. And sales will be hurt when Japan imposes a 9.2%
across-the-board cut in drug prices this month.
   Nevertheless, analysts expect the industry's strong
performance to continue in the rest of 1990, aided by
comparisons with weaker quarters. Ronald Nordmann, an analyst
at PaineWebber Inc., sees an 18% increase in industrywide
earnings for 1990 from 1989. Richard Vietor, drug industry
analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., forecasts 16% annual growth.
   Merck, long the leading performer, faltered slightly, with
profit estimated at 15% to 18% above the $340.4 million, or
86 cents a share, reported in the 1989 first period, analysts
say. In comparison, rivals Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,
Warner-Lambert Co. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co., are expected to post
gains of at least 18%.
   "If there was a company we might be a little nervous
about, it would be Merck," Mr. Vietor says. "Merck probably
has the most exposure to Japan and has been accelerating
spending as they have been bringing on a new sales force. But
we're still talking about a 15% increase." Marc Mayer,
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. sees Merck as having
had a 17%-18% quarter. In Rahway, N.J., Merck said it doesn't
comment on analyst projections.
   Lilly is expected to post a 20% rise in profit, from
$284.7 million, or 99 cents a share, adjusted for a stock
split a year earlier. The company's profits were driven by
brisk sales of its anti-depressant drug Prozac, plus growth
in its catheter business, which was bolstered when a
competitor had to withdraw its catheter products from the
market. "Everything seems to be going Lilly's way right now,"
Mr. Mayer says. Lilly, based in Indianapolis, declined to
comment.
   Analysts said the October merger at Bristol Myers Squibb
Co. brought cost savings that contributed to probably an 18%
profit increase, as compared with the earnings of Bristol
Myers and Squibb. On a pro forma basis, the two companies had
year-ago first-quarter profit of $344 million, or 66 cents a
share. Sales of Capoten, a drug for blood pressure and
congestive heart failure, helped fuel growth. The New
Yorkbased company declined to comment.
   Warner-Lambert said its first-quarter earnings would rise
about 20% from the $101.1 million, or $1.49 a share, a year
earlier. The results were driven by strong sales of its
anti-convulsant Dilantin and its Lopid cholesterol drug, as
well as by demand for flu products. The company said it was
on target for at least 15% to 16% earnings growth for the
current year.
   Schering-Plough Corp., Madison, N.J., said it is
"comfortable" with analysts' first-quarter profit estimates
of $1.30 to $1.33 a share, an increase of 16% to 19% from
last year's $125.7 million, or $1.12 a share.
   American Home Products Co. earnings look to be up about
11% from $263.8 million, or $1.80 a share, a year earlier,
according to Mr. Nordmann. American Home wouldn't comment.
   Trailing the pack are Upjohn Co. and Pfizer Inc. "Upjohn
is underperforming its peers because of continued softness in
its major line of tranquilizers and sedatives," Mr. Nordmann
said. These include the prescription drugs Xanax and Halcion.
Upjohn, Kalamazoo, Mich., is expected to report that profit
rose about 7% from the year-earlier $103.0 million, or 56
cents a share.
   Analysts see Pfizer reporting a flat first quarter, with
the aid of a 13-cent-a-share gain from the previously
announced sale of a unit. "Pfizer has a very good new product
flow," Mr. Mayer says, and Procardia XL, a sustained-release
version of its Procardia heart drug, is doing well. But the
company is spending heavily for marketing and research. A
year ago, New York-based Pfizer earned $240.8 million, or
$1.43 a share. Pfizer declined to comment.

   PITTSBURGH -- Aluminum-industry executives caved in last
November to can buyers' demands for lower prices.
   Except for Paul O'Neill. Ignoring the advice of virtually
every top Alcoa official, the chief executive of Aluminum Co.
of America broke with the industry's lock-step pricing
mentality.

   It was a costly decision. Enraged customers canceled
orders with Alcoa, and so far the No. 1 aluminum maker has
lost perhaps $100 million of sales and several percentage
points of can-market share.
   Exceptional as the move was, it was what the industry has
come to expect from Paul O'Neill. Ever since he became
Alcoa's chief executive three years ago, he has shown a
penchant for unorthodox ideas.
   The rationale in this case is that Mr. O'Neill is
determined to get more stable pricing in the aluminum
industry. "It's nonsensical to lower can-sheet prices every
time the price of raw aluminum ingot {the primary metal}
falls on the world market," he says. "Have you ever tried to
put beer into an ingot?"
   Nevertheless, last week Mr. O'Neill discovered just how
hard it is to be a corporate maverick and resist industry
forces. On Friday, Alcoa's stock took a hit when a securities
analyst, First Boston's Peter Anker, said Alcoa had begun
giving selected price discounts to some major cansheet
buyers. He also lowered his rating on the stock, which closed
down $1.375 at $62 in heavy Big Board trading.
   Asked about the analyst's statement, Mr. O'Neill says he
won't talk about dealings with individual customers, but
contends his pricing strategy is still in place. "We walked
away from a substantial amount of business {in November} that
could have been ours if we had discounted -- and we didn't,"
he insists. "I haven't given up on the logic of that idea."
   Recasting Alcoa has been Mr. O'Neill's mission ever since
discontented directors ousted his predecessor and lured him
from the presidency of International Paper Co. Taking over
the staid, century-old metal company, he scrapped its forays
into high-tech businesses like ceramics and composite
materials to focus solely on aluminum, a strategy contrary to
that of rivals such as Reynolds Metals Co. He has linked
employee pay and shareholder dividends more directly to
profits. And he rejects Wall Street demands for quick
returns.
   "What Paul is after is longer-term results. This is
somebody not building the Alcoa of next month but 10 years
from now," says Judith M. Gueron, an Alcoa director and the
president of Manpower Demonstration Research Corp., a
social-services research organization.
   But not all shareholders are that patient. Even though
Alcoa's net income rose 10% last year to a record $945
million, or $10.67 a share, on sales of $10.91 billion, many
holders are angry about its 24% plunge in fourth-quarter
profit. "I got smacked right in the middle of the head --
caught by total surprise," says John Lattanzio, portfolio
manager at Steinhardt Partners, which nevertheless has hung
onto its nearly 5% stake.
   Mr. O'Neill had met with analysts just weeks before but
hadn't warned them -- partly, he says, because "the emphasis
on quarterly results is ridiculous." The result was that the
stock got clobbered when the profit report came out.
   Mr. O'Neill faces even tougher times ahead in trying to
counter traditionally cyclical aluminum profits in a soft
economy. Partly because of his can-sheet pricing moves,
Alcoa's earnings in the first quarter could skid as much as
40% from a year earlier and, for the year, will probably fall
25%, analysts say. (Alcoa's chief rival, Alcan Aluminium
Ltd., is suffering, too; its fourth-quarter net income fell
45%, and analysts predict drops of about 75% in the first
quarter and as much as 70% for all of 1990.)
   The 54-year-old Mr. O'Neill insists that Alcoa can make
good money on aluminum with the right mix of pricing, product
and management strategies. Soon after arriving at Alcoa in
June 1987, he sold off nonaluminum holdings, including a
natural-gas drilling business and most of an
aerospace-materials company acquired by his predecessor,
Charles A. Parry.
   Such divestitures have been backed by directors, who
expect aluminum demand to grow robustly in the 1990s.
Earlier, they had fought Mr. Parry's plans, arguing that
Alcoa should stick to what it knew best. "I don't think he
had his diversification program sorted out very well," says
W.H. Krome George, a director and former Alcoa chairman who
led the revolt against Mr. Parry.
   A lifetime veteran of Alcoa, Mr. Parry won't comment on
his ouster. Associates assert that his diversification plans
contributed to the board's lack of confidence in his
stewardship. They claim that though Mr. Parry was affable and
well-liked by Alcoans, he simply wasn't a leader and had a
blurred vision of where he wanted to take Alcoa.
   In Mr. O'Neill, directors have a chairman whose style is
as distinct as his strategy. The first outsider to run the
aluminum giant -- though he was an Alcoa director at the time
of the boardroom coup -- he broke with tradition from the
start. He did away with the corporate limousine and booked
commercial flights. A nongolfer, he declined to join the
clubs frequented by top Alcoa executives.
   He also didn't bring any trusted aides with him and,
unlike many imported CEOs, didn't fire veteran executives.
Instead of barking out orders, he asked people what he could
do to help them; in fact, some Alcoans, accustomed to gruff
handling, at first thought him a wimp. He encouraged
employees, even hourly workers, to get in touch with him if
they had a problem. (One call from a rank-and-filer in
Warrick County, Ind., led to reassignment of the plant
manager there.)
   Mr. O'Neill came to the corporate suite late in life,
after a career in government, where he had risen to
second-ranking budget official during the Ford
administration. He still confers regularly with President
Bush and says he would like to return to government someday.
   He is a frugal man. At Alcoa, he avoids the executive
dining suite for a quick sandwich at his desk and a 20-minute
walk. Even though his cash compensation last year totaled
$1.3 million, he buys his suits off the rack at Kaufmann's, a
middlebrow Pittsburgh department store, and passes down used
cars to his children rather than buying them new ones.
"Paul's not impressed by the normal things that impress
people," Ms. Gueron says.
   Mr. O'Neill imposes similar frugality on managers,
compelling them to wring better returns out of aluminum.
Touring Alcoa's sprawling power plant at its Rockdale, Texas,
smelter, he noticed water leaking from boiler pipes. Once the
tour ended, he told the plant manager to fix the leak -- and
submit a report on it to him.
   At the same time, Mr. O'Neill has begun creating an
environment in which Alcoa employees think more for
themselves. In Texas, plant workers devised a new system to
reduce power costs by $400,000 a year. In Brazil, employees
suggested a new wooden shipping crate that saved another
$150,000. In Tennessee, an employee-led innovation cut by 40%
the processing time for a coil of aluminum. To help keep
employees pursuing such improvements, half of Alcoa's 61,000
workers world-wide are now covered by some form of variable
compensation tied to corporate profits; that's up from just
5% three years ago.
   Most of the 1989 profit gain reflected reduced debt -- a
reduction partly achieved with proceeds from selling
non-aluminum operations -- and a consequent $100 million cut
in interest expenses since 1986. Interest income, meanwhile,
has skyrocketed some $200 million. The resulting improvement
in the cash position, along with widespread cost cutting, has
brightened the profit picture. Now, Alcoa can earn nearly $6
a share with the primary-aluminum price at only 55 cents a
pound -- triple the 1986 profitability. At present, the price
is 70 cents a pound; last year, it averaged 88 cents.
   Mr. O'Neill predicts that the company will average at
least a 15% return on equity in the future and not less than
10% in any year. That would be a huge jump: Alcoa's rate of
return averaged only 9.7% in the pre-O'Neill decade.
   Any such increase in profitability would directly benefit
Alcoa stockholders. Under a new formula, they are guaranteed
a 40-cent quarterly dividend plus 30% of any profits over $6
a share, a level easily exceeded last year.
   Meanwhile, Mr. O'Neill has encouraged managers to base
more of their decisionmaking on nonfinancial measures. At his
request, Alcoa people gathered tons of data about
productivity, safety, quality -- some 450 nonfinancial
measures in all -- plus similar information about competitors
to give his managers benchmarks.
   The benchmarks were revealing. Executives learned, for
instance, that one Japanese fabricator could roll aluminum
can sheet and reuse 20% more of the leftover scrap than Alcoa
could. They also found that the average smelter at its Texas
plant had to be relined after 1,221 days of use, compared
with 2,700 days at an Alusuisse plant in Switzerland.
   Mr. O'Neill pushes hard in several areas, including:
   -- Finding new uses for aluminum, especially in the
packaging, construction, aircraft and automotive markets. For
example, Alcoa has stepped up efforts to get more aluminum in
cars. The Audi unit of Volkswagen AG will soon unveil plans
for the world's first mass-produced aluminum car, which was
designed in a joint effort with Alcoa and is due out in 1993.
   -- Quality, which means to Mr. O'Neill not simply better
products and fewer complaints from customers but also the way
Alcoa employees approach their jobs. He appointed a team of
35 professionals, led by a vice president of quality, who so
far have indoctrinated 1,800 employees in the "quality
process." The process, taught over 10 days, is a rigorous
system for identifying and correcting lapses.
   -- And workplace safety, an issue seldom mentioned by
CEOs. Whether speaking to securities analysts, senior
management or the rank and file, Mr. O'Neill invariably talks
about safety first. Early on, he said he aims for an
"injury-free workplace." Assuming accidents would occur, the
executive told skeptical managers, was no longer acceptable.
Even union officials were dumbfounded; many said it was
unattainable. But the company has set stringent goals and
already has cut its serious injuries 30% since 1986.
   Safety matters, says Mr. O'Neill, because it tells
employees that they matter. But his relentless emphasis on
the issue has confused some employees. In fact, though many
Alcoans praise Mr. O'Neill, many others say he is puzzling.
Speaking to senior executives at a management retreat in
Florida last October, for instance, he talked for four hours
about "recreating Alcoa." Afterward, the 29 participants were
asked for critiques of the session. Wrote one: "We're still
learning to speak his language."
   Mr. O'Neill never seems to stop speaking to employees.
Last year, he logged some 175,000 miles and spent 137 days
away from headquarters, including 39 days outside the U.S.,
visiting Alcoa facilities.
   At the start of another trip, riding in a Chevy van
through a dark Texas night en route to the plant in Rockdale,
Mr. O'Neill questioned his driver, plant manager Jack Drake,
in a gently prodding manner that accentuated the positive.
   "That's terrific, Jack," he said as Mr. Drake explained
how one office worker's idea helped the plant reduce the
funds held in its local checking account by $50,000.
   During the next day, hourly workers beamed with pride as
they showed off their inventions that have transformed
Rockdale from an also-ran plant that had been targeted for
possible closure some years ago into a profitable performer.
   "If you can't convince people that they're more important
than the volume of products they get out the door, you
haven't got a chance," Mr. O'Neill asserts. "I don't believe
in management by fear. It doesn't make for lasting change,
because as soon as the fear driver goes away, people relax."
   Yet some Alcoa people worry that Mr. O'Neill's benevolent
but demanding style might turn ugly someday. "People are
afraid he'll strip the corporate headquarters staff if
business goes bad," one vice president says. Already, Mr.
O'Neill has transferred nearly 100 senior managers to plants
in rural Tennessee to get them closer to operations. Adds
another manager: "You're never sure Paul's satisfied. He's a
workaholic" -- sometimes arriving at work as early as 4:30
a.m. -- "and very demanding. If business turns down, what
will he be like?"
   Heightening worries was Mr. O'Neill's unilateral pricing
move in November, which critics contend exhibited his
tendency to "micro-manage" -- or meddle. Alcoa veterans
contend that his refusal to follow discounting by Alcan,
Reynolds and Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. cost Alcoa
customers that it will take months, at the least, to woo
back. In the aftermath, they note, Alcoa laid off 100
workers.
   A disgruntled buyer at Pearl Brewing Co., who has reduced
purchases of Alcoa aluminum for the Texas brewery's beer
cans, complains: "Alcoa claims they're selling quality, but
in today's market you don't buy quality. That's expected."
   Mr. O'Neill argues that holding the line on pricing is the
only way to overcome the cyclicality of aluminum profits.
"Just because somebody else hasn't {held prices} before,
doesn't seem to me a good reason not to try," he says. "For
the long run, we've got to insist on better economics" than
the industry has had in the past.
   By refusing to reduce prices last November when the bulk
of can-sheet was ordered for the first half of 1990, Alcoa
lost business, Mr. O'Neill concedes. But, he asserts, the
company has already regained some customers and will win back
even more as the year progresses and can-sheet supplies
tighten.
   "We've had a whole bunch of business come back to us in
the last six weeks," he says. "Before 1990 is over, we could
end up at or even above" the sales levels once projected for
this year. It is in the course of winning back customers that
Alcoa has done some slight discounting after all, industry
insiders say.
   Some 39,000 feet above Kentucky, airborne on a jet
whisking him to his next plant visit, Mr. O'Neill confesses
frustration with the "time it takes to create deep-seated
change" in a corporate giant.
   The market may want quick results, he concedes. What he's
after, though, takes time. "There will be a few bumps along
the way," he says, his feet propped up on the seat facing
him. "But if we succeed in creating lasting change, then the
short-term stuff will take care of itself."

   This State May Be Penny-Wise,
   But It Sure Looks Pound-Foolish

   BOSTON -- At last count, Massachusetts is facing a budget
deficit this year of $800 million.
   Make that $799,999,999.99, thanks to a punctilious
computer that figures a penny taxed is a penny earned.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Part of the credit for reducing the state's megadeficit
also goes to Anne Eustis, the exceedingly scrupulous town
treasurer of Princeton, Mass. In February, during a year-end
review of the town's books, Mrs. Eustis found she'd
shortchanged the state 10 cents on town payroll withholding
last July. "So I called {the state revenue department} up and
asked them if they wanted it paid," Mrs. Eustis notes.
   She needn't have asked. "They said yes, they did." Off
went a letter explaining the error and a check for the 10
cents.
   Her fiscal good nature was soon to be taxed, however. Two
weeks later, the state responded with a bill seeking an
additional penny for interest due on the 10 cents. "I
literally got a bill for a penny," she says, noting that it
seems rather ridiculous that the state would spend a quarter
on postage to collect a penny.
   The state blames the dunning notice on a computer. Once an
adjustment has been made to a payment, explains spokeswoman
Betsy Houghteling, it automatically goes into a computer
system, and the state issues a notice of assessment. The
computer, in kicking out a notice of assessment for the 10
cents, even though it had already been paid, tacked on a bill
for the penny interest.
   The taxpayer-assistance person who originally advised Mrs.
Eustis to pay the dime was probably just trying to help, and
had Mrs. Eustis talked to a different person she might have
been told to forget about it, Ms. Houghteling says. She adds:
"I'm sure it was a sincere attempt to keep her on the right
side of everything, but it ended up generating a lot of paper
around it."
   Ms. Houghteling says the Princeton case is a "once in a
blue moon" situation and Mrs. Eustis can rest assured the
state won't pinch Princeton for the penny. "It's good that
she's so careful with her accounting, but she needn't worry
that anything will happen subsequent to this," Ms.
Houghteling adds.
   Mrs. Eustis says she won't write a check for the one-penny
interest, which is due on April 15, but will probably tape a
penny to the bill and send it back.

   Heineken Turns to New Types of Beer,
   Restructuring of Operations to Lift Sales

   AMSTERDAM -- As Heineken N.V.'s mainstay beer markets in
the U.S. and Europe become saturated by its traditional
pilsner brand, the Dutch brewer is turning to new types of
beer and a restructuring of its operations to boost sales and
market share, the company said in its annual report.
   However, despite the changes, the Dutch brewer issued only
a cautious forecast for 1990.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We take a positive view with regard to the long-term
profit growth. . . . At the present moment, however, it is
not possible to express a well-founded expectation regarding
the results for the current financial year," Heineken said.
   The forecast comes after a relatively strong year in 1989,
when net income rose nearly 12% to 325 million guilders
($169.8 million) from 291 million guilders a year earlier.
   Heineken said its move to new varieties of beer reflects
changes in demand and changes in the social attitude toward
alcohol consumption in general.
   "The beer market is affected by a number of different
social developments, such as increasing individualization on
the part of the consumer . . . and reflection about the use
of alcohol," Heineken said.
   The response by Heineken is to offer more varieties of
beer, especially low or no alcohol beers. A Heineken
representative confirmed in March that the Dutch brewer is
aiming to introduce two beers a year, with the first new beer
in 1990 scheduled to come out this summer. However, the
representative declined to say what type of beer it will be.
   This isn't to say that Heineken is giving up on its most
popular pilsner brand of beer. Pilsner sales continued to
maintain Heineken's third-place position in the global beer
market and its leading position in the European market,
according to the company.
   In fact, global beer sales at Heineken last year rose 6.8%
to 6.419 billion guilders from 6.008 billion guilders in
1988. However, its global soft-drink sales rose at an even
faster clip of nearly 15%, to 811 million guilders in 1989
from 707 million guilders in 1988.
   These two sales figures accounted for the majority of the
brewer's total 1989 turnover of 7.820 billion guilders, with
hard liquor, wine and other revenue making up the rest.
   As the 1992 goal of an integrated European market comes
closer, Heineken said it will study restructuring its
operations to fit a Pan-European market.
   "Heineken has for a number of years been active in
numerous important markets in Europe. We are accordingly
studying whether the future situation in Europe should also
have consequences for the organization of our production
activities, the logistical structure and our marketing,"
Heineken said.
   Some of the these changes have already been apparent.
   Heineken attempted to implement a restructuring plan for
its Dutch operations earlier this year but was blocked by
strikes. The company said it will again attempt a
restructuring after consultations with its labor unions.
   Also in response to 1992, Heineken said in March that it
would switch its European advertising account to J. Walter
Thompson of the U.S. Prior to this, Heineken used individual
ad agencies in its separate European markets.
   By geographic region, Heineken's 1989 sales and earnings
from its mainstay product, beer, were improved overall, but
there were important exceptions.
   In Europe, Heineken's most important market, beer sales
are showing signs of flagging with a rise of only 4.4% from
1988. In addition, Heineken attributed part of the growth to
unusually warm weather last summer.
   In its largest European market, the Netherlands, the trend
to a more fragmented market was apparent. Sales of Heineken's
traditional pilsner brand decreased, but the Dutch brewer was
able to boost its overall market share through its purchase
of Koninklijke Brand Bierbrouwerij B.V., a specialty beer
producer that had a 4% market share. Adding to its sales,
Heineken also introduced its Dry 100 beer, and boosted the
sales of its Ridder beer.
   However, competition also became more intense, resulting
in higher costs and decreased margins, Heineken said.
Earnings rose through its increased sales.
   Although per-capita consumption of beer in the Netherlands
increased in 1989, this was due at least in part to the
weather. In several recent years, per-capita consumption of
beer has been steadily declining and consumption of normal
alcohol beers, such as its pilsner brand, as part of that
consumption is also down.
   In the U.S., Heineken's sales were hit by a weaker dollar,
a decrease in the popularity of imported beers and more
competition from specialty beers from the small U.S.
breweries. Although Heineken gave no indication what effect
this had on its earnings, the company did note that while its
overall sales in the U.S. declined, it maintained its leading
position in the imported beer market.
   In Canada, both earnings and sales from its Heineken and
Amstel brands were lower after Heineken's market was hit by
increased competition from lower-priced U.S. imports and from
Canadian breweries.
   Heineken chalked up gains in the Caribbean and Latin
American markets despite problems stemming from political
instability in several markets, inflation, and Hurricane
Hugo, which disrupted some Caribbean economies.
   Despite these problems, sales in the Caribbean and Latin
America increased enough to offset the depressed market
conditions in North America. The results were that overall
sales in the Western Hemisphere showed the most rapid growth
of all of Heineken's major market areas by rising 12%.
   In Africa, Heineken's third-largest market, beer sales
declined 1.5% as economic difficulties cut consumption in
several countries. Also disrupting operations in Africa were
more stringent restrictions for obtaining the foreign
currencies needed for raw materials, machinery and spare
parts.
   In Australia, Asia and Oceania, Heineken's smallest market
area, overall sales grew 7.7%. However, on a
country-by-country basis, the results were mixed with sales
and earnings improving in Malaysia, Singapore and New
Zealand. Competition cut market share and sales in Australia,
while the political crackdown in China curtailed operations
there.
   In Japan, Heineken's sales dropped, and as a result, the
brewer decided to restructure its operations there by
incorporating marketing and sales efforts into a single
operation.

   SEC Task Force to Conduct Wide Study
   Into Regulation of Investment Firms

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission's
investment management division has set up a task force to
conduct a sweeping study into the regulation of mutual funds
and other investment companies, the division's head said.
   Kathryn McGrath, the SEC's director of investment
management, said in an interview that the 12-member group
will work for at least a year to "study what should be done
legislatively or by the commission to bring the U.S. system
of regulation" up to date.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The study will be the first in almost 25 years to take a
comprehensive look at how mutual funds should be registered
and managed and whether the current disclosure process still
works, she said. "We're looking at anything and everything
about investment companies," Ms. McGrath said. "We want to
know anything that's too onerous so that it can be removed.
Anything that's missing we might recommend be added."
   She said the division will issue a release in the next
month or so asking for input from the public and investment
companies on directions the study should take.
   Separately, Ms. McGrath said her division is working on
proposals to tighten the flexibility of money-market funds.
The proposals would focus on making sure that funds aren't
too reliant on a single issuer of short-term paper, she said,
"so that if they hit a bad issuer it won't hurt them as
badly."
   She said the measures were triggered in part by last
year's problems in the bond market and by the difficulties
this year with some issuers of commercial paper. "This will
help make money-market funds a tad safer," Ms. McGrath said.
   Ms. McGrath added that the SEC received a number of
comment letters about a three-pronged proposal to beef up
disclosure of mutual funds. The most controverial measure
would force funds to tell shareholders or prospective
investors who manages the fund and details about that
manager's business experience.
   Ms. McGrath said industry comments generally opposed the
proposal, as had been expected. Industry officials have
argued that such disclosure would create a star system in the
industry and that many funds are run by teams of managers,
rather than a single individual.
   The SEC said at the time it issued the proposal, however,
that it received more than 300 letters from investors
supporting management disclosure after it proposed a similar
requirement for closed-end mutual funds.
   Ms. McGrath also said industry reaction was cool to a
second proposal that would require funds to state in
prospectuses how well they met investment goals for the prior
year.
   But the industry and others backed the third measure, she
said, which would add a line to the prospectus to show a
fund's 10-year total return, or performance plus dividends.
"That's really the bottom line of what an investor would make
from making an investment," she said.

by the venture's data bank. With the loan proceeds, the
venture will buy Digicon's rights to a seismic data bank of
9,500 miles of U.S. onshore seismic data and 155,000 miles of
offshore data. Seitel's loan will be repaid through revenue
from the licensing of this data.

   Seitel said it intended to file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission a proposed public offering of one million
shares of common stock. Half the issue, 500,000 shares, will
be newly issued; 350,000 will be offered by its principal
stockholder, Helm Resources Inc.; 150,000 shares will be
offered by three individual stockholders. Seitel's proceeds
from the sale will go to pay for the proposed joint venture
with Digicon and for other purposes.
   Seitel develops proprietary seismic data and arranges the
acquisition and marketing of that data. Based in Houston,
Digicon is currently operating under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code; approval of the bankruptcy court is
necessary to complete the transaction, as well as consent
from Digicon's principal lender.

   GE Sues Daimler-Benz for $1.15 Billion,
   Alleging Breach of Jet-Engine Contract

   NEW YORK -- General Electric Co. filed a $1.15 billion
suit against Daimler-Benz AG, charging the West German
industrial group with breaking an agreement to develop
high-thrust commercial jet engines.
   The suit stems from Daimler-Benz entering "a memorandum of
understanding" with United Technologies Corp. on a wide range
of commercial engine programs between their jet engine units.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   GE charged in the suit, filed in federal court here, that
Daimler-Benz broke the exclusive and binding relationship in
this area with the company. GE, a Fairfield, Conn.,
manufacturer, claims that proprietary and other sensitive
information it shared with Daimler will find its way into the
hands of its competitor, United Technologies.
   Daimler-Benz said it is studying the suit but as yet sees
no basis for it.
   In the suit, GE said that for more than 25 years its
aircraft engine unit and Daimler's Motoren-und Turbinen-Union
unit, known as MTU, have been "parties to a series of
contracts" in which they have shared "highly confidential
technological information, revenues and costs in the
development and sale of commercial jet engines."
   According to the court papers, in 1981 GE entered into a
contract with MTU under which GE shared a variety of
information in connection with the development of a subsonic
jet engine for commercial aircraft. That engine is now a
major source of revenue for GE's aircraft engine business.
Then in 1988, GE and MTU signed a letter of agreement to
cooperate in a program to develop the next generation of
high-thrust commercial jet engines.
   The latest agreement on high-thrust engines also stated
that "for the life of this program, MTU will not participate"
with competitors of GE in programs involving engines in the
thrust range over 50,000 pounds, GE said. GE's cooperative
arrangement with MTU on the new generation of jet engines,
known as GE90, intended to ultimately have thrust of 95,000
pounds or greater. These engines are aimed at powering
next-generation widebody planes.
   GE said it has shared detailed design specifications,
thrust ratios, parts configurations and fuel efficiency and
materials data with MTU. "The extent of the proprietary
information provided to MTU enables MTU or a competitor of
General Electric to plan and eventually develop and market
the new high-thrust jet engine being developed by General
Electric," the company said in its complaint.
   GE said that on March 20, MTU told GE about its plan to
develop with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines that would directly
compete with GE's.
   A spokesman for United Technologies declined to comment on
the suit, noting that the company wasn't named in the
litigation. But he said the company's Pratt &amp; Whitney unit
has had "a close partnership with MTU since the early 1970s
on several engines" and that its alliance with MTU was a
"logical outgrowth of that."
   As for the issue of GE's proprietary information in the
hands of MTU, he said Pratt &amp; Whitney doesn't "need or want
any GE confidential information."

   Defense Contractors Are Set to Report
   Strong Earnings for the First Quarter

   Defense contractors are set to post relatively strong
earnings for the first quarter, having taken steps to ward
off one of their biggest balance-sheet demons: the
fixed-price development contract.
   Still, the industry isn't exactly breathing a sigh of
relief. It knows the worst is yet to come. "The fixed-price
contracts have been devastating," says Lior Bregman, of
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "But the effect of peace breaking out
hasn't even taken much of a toll yet."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Indeed, with cutbacks in the defense budget imminent, some
major military contractors "won't have the cash flows to
survive this thing" over the long haul, predicts James
Cunnane, chief financial officer of St. Louis-based General
Dynamics Corp., which builds tanks, submarines and airplanes.
   But in the meantime, weapons manufacturers are sure to
revel in any positive numbers they can squeeze out, thankful
at least that the scourge of fixed-price work is in large
part behind them.
   Under fixed-price accords with the government, companies
must pay for all costs that exceed a predetermined ceiling.
On large-scale development work, which invariably involves
expensive engineering changes along the way, such a formula
almost always triggers heavy losses. In 1989, more than $2
billion in write-downs were logged collectively by the
biggest defense companies because of these agreements. On top
of that, five of the largest aerospace companies were
compelled to put up huge sums as part of a cost-sharing
arrangement in their bid for the Air Force's next-generation
jet, the Advanced Tactical Fighter.
   "The environment over the last couple of years has
produced a large financial commitment on the part of industry
-- one it no longer can afford," Mr. Cunnane says.
   But for the short-term anyway, things may be brighter.
Many companies, while vowing not to sign any more rigidly
termed research contracts, went a long way last year toward
accounting for their cost overruns on such work.
   "There is always a risk, some unknown out there," says
John Campbell, senior vice president, finance, at Northrop
Corp., which in both 1988 and 1989 made provisions of $150
million for expected losses on certain classified long-term
fixed-price pacts. "But, obviously, we've worked down the
exposure we had. The risk going forward has to be much less."
   Lockheed Corp., whose $490 million in write-downs on five
fixed-price projects became a point of attack for Dallas
investor Harold Simmons in his recent proxy contest against
the company, also is promising that 1990 will be a better
year. Beginning with the first quarter, the Calabasas,
Calif., concern will turn in "a solid financial performance,"
says Chairman Daniel Tellep. "We expect a big pickup over
all."
   In fact, given the pressure applied by Mr. Simmons,
Lockheed is sure to go out of its way to keep its books
clean. For instance, though waging the proxy fight cost the
company some $8 million before taxes -- roughly a
10-cent-a-share hit to net income, all other things being
equal -- Lockheed isn't expected to break out those
expenditures as a special item. (It's believed that about
half the proxy expenses will be recorded in the first
quarter, and half in the second.)
   Lawrence Harris, who follows Lockheed for Bateman Eichler,
Hill Richards Inc., a Los Angeles brokerage firm, also thinks
an AFP-731 spy satellite that broke up in orbit last month
could require the company to refigure its profit rate on the
program. But indications are that, at least for the first
quarter, Lockheed won't be making any such adjustment. The
company, as is its policy on classified matters, won't even
comment on whether it assembled the satellite in the first
place.
   Others are bound to rack up impressive increases in
profits. Mr. Bregman says defense electronics companies, in
particular, tend to be better managed than some of the big
airframe makers, and he is anticipating double-digit earnings
gains at both Loral Corp. and E-Systems Inc. He is also
looking for some improvement at Martin Marietta Corp. and
Raytheon Co.
   Yet not every company has laid to rest its earnings
difficulties. General Dynamics, for instance, is expected by
Wall Street to report that its operating profit dropped
slightly. Rockwell International Corp.'s earnings, hurt by a
weak auto market, also could be down slightly.

   Dime Financial
   Says 1st-Period Net
   Flat to 7% Higher

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
</IN>
<LP>
   WALLINGFORD, Conn. -- Dime Financial Corp. expects to post
first-quarter earnings from flat to as much as 7% higher, as
the bank conservatively forgoes substantial loan growth in a
weakened Northeast real estate environment.
   John C. Shortell, president and chief executive officer,
said Dime expects to report per-share earnings of 35 cents to
38 cents a share, or $1.9 million to $2 million, compared
with $1.9 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The quarter went "pretty much as we expected," Mr.
Shortell said in an interview. For the year, he said, "We're
on target to earn a little bit more than last year's" $1.36 a
share. Analysts see $1.35 to $1.45 a share for the year at
the holding company for Dime Savings Bank of Wallingford and
City Savings Bank of Meriden. Mr. Shortell said the parent
should "fall within that range."
   The thrift has maintained its critical capital ratios at
the expense of increasing its loan base, Mr. Shortell said.
Total capital at March 31 was 11.3% of assets vs. 11.4% at
Dec. 31, and tangible capital -- subtracting good will -- was
10.7% vs. 10.8%.
   At the same time, he said total loans grew barely 1% to
$694 million at March 31. Nonperforming loans grew to 1.62%
of total loans from 1.33% at Dec. 31, but they fell from
1.84% at their Sept. 30 peak, Mr. Shortell said.
   Reserves for nonperforming loans at March 31 were $2.2
million, covering 20% of nonperforming loans, compared with
$2.1 million, covering 22%.
   "We're about as well positioned" as possible, Mr. Shortell
said. "The first point to make is that 60% of our loans are
in one-to four-family" housing. "As long as we avoid a
general recession, we'll get paid on time."
   Mr. Shortell also says thrifts that belong to the Federal
Home Loan Bank system until recently could borrow as much as
30% of their assets from the system to fund loans. "We have
leveraged capital this way," he says. But "when you come to a
time like this and can't stretch {to make} a loan, we take
deposits and reduce interest expense by paying down" the home
loan bank loans. At March 31, Dime had $169 million of home
loan bank borrowings compared with a Sept. 30 peak of $186
million.
   The bank doesn't see a major turnaround in either
residential or commercial real estate. "What we're hoping is
that the slide doesn't go any further," Mr. Shortell says.
"The key to Connecticut is that the unemployment rate" is
4.1% vs. 3.1% a year ago. "It's still not a bad number, but
where is it heading? Can Connecticut avoid 7% unemployment?
If it can, it will help us. If not, it adds a whole new layer
of problems" for the area.
   In this environment, "You make only the loans you're
comfortable with, keep non-interest expense as low as
possible," and "ride it out," Mr. Shortell says.
   "One of the good things about this crummy environment," he
says, is that banks that are "up to their ears in problem
loans" are forced to turn away even good credit risks. Dime
Financial is able to make some of those loans, he says.
   Dime Financial's nonperforming loans "may have peaked"
last fall, Mr. Shortell says. He adds that they aren't
"heading down in perfectly symmetrical fashion, but they are
heading downward. . . . I think we'll be able to keep
nonperforming loans below" 2% of total loans, he says.
   "What I'm more concerned with is: We made a profit in each
year of the 1980s," and earnings have grown for each of the
past seven years. "If the {loan} growth comes, it comes. If
the good loans aren't there, we're simply not going to
stretch."

   Computer Horizons Says 1st-Quarter Net
   Slumped but Operating Results Climbed

   Computer Horizons Corp. officials estimated that
first-quarter net income fell 57% from the year before, but
excluding a year-earlier gain from an accounting change,
earnings advanced 50%.
   The computer-systems integrator cited new contracts and
the benefits of a fourth-quarter 1989 restructuring for the
improved operating results. The company expects
second-quarter results to exceed the first quarter's and it
projects, without being specific, a "very strong" year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Computer Horizons also rejected a major shareholder's
request for board representation and for a standstill
agreement.
   Computer Horizons, based in Mountain Lakes, N.J., expects
to report net of "better than 25 cents a share," or $600,000,
compared with $1.4 million, or 59 cents a share, John J.
Cassese, president and chief executive officer, said in an
interview. But year-earlier earnings before the accounting
change, which was related to deferred taxes, were $401,000,
or 16 cents a share.
   Revenue exceeded $23 million, up at least 17% from $19.7
million, Mr. Cassese estimated.
   In 1989's fourth quarter, Computer Horizons charged $3.3
million to restructure and $600,000 to cover bad debts and
for other reserves. The revamping "opened us up in 1990 with
reduced costs," said Bernhard Hubert, senior vice president
and chief financial officer.
   "We closed or downsized seven offices," cutting selling,
general and administrative staff 15%, Mr. Hubert said.
Computer Horizons wrote off a few small balance-sheet items
and "downsized some compensation plans," Mr. Hubert said.
   Full-year 1989 "is blurred by the restructuring charge.
But for that {charge}, we'd have made 40 cents" a share, Mr.
Hubert said. For 1989, Computer Horizons posted a loss of
$291,000, or 55 cents a share.
   The business of integrating computer systems has plenty of
players, big and small. One of the company's strategies is to
work in partnership with the majors, Mr. Cassese said, noting
that the company is working with International Business
Machines Corp. to put together a system for an IBM client.
   And contracts Computer Horizons itself has signed recently
include systems work for Exxon Corp. and the A.C. Nielsen
unit of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. The company also continues to
do significant work with General Electric Co., Mr. Cassese
said.
   Recently, Compagnie Generale d'Informatique, a Paris
company with systems-integration interests, boosted its stake
in Computer Horizons to 16.8%, bumping up against the level
at which Computer Horizons' poison-pill anti-takeover rights
would kick in. Such rights are designed to make a hostile
takeover prohibitively expensive.
   In a March 22 letter to Mr. Cassese, CGI President Bernard
Chapot said CGI regrets Computer Horizons managers'
"persistent refusal . . . to discuss areas of common
interest. . . ." Mr. Chapot calls the poison pill
"unwarranted."
   CGI then proposed a six-month standstill accord. CGI said
it wouldn't make a tender offer or wage a proxy fight for
Computer Horizons. In return, Computer Horizons would add one
CGI representative to the board and name an additional
director independent of both companies.
   But in a letter dated April 5, Mr. Cassese told Mr.
Chapot, "If, as you have been holding out, you have any
suggestions that will benefit" Computer Horizons and its
shareholders -- "not just CGI -- we want to hear them. We
keep meeting with you to hear them, but we've heard nothing
yet."

   Major Oil Concerns Expected to Report
   Flat to Lower First-Quarter Earnings

OIL, INTEGRATED MAJORS (OIL)
PETROLEUM (PET)
</IN>
<LP>
   HOUSTON -- Despite higher crude oil prices, most major oil
companies are expected to report flat to lower first-quarter
earnings. And the profit outlook for the current quarter
isn't any better.
   "For the industry, last year's first quarter is going to
be tough to match," C.J. Silas, chairman of Phillips
Petroleum Co., said in a recent interview.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Specifically, the 18 largest oil companies are expected to
post first-quarter operating earnings totaling about $5.56
billion, down 2.2% from a year earlier, according to Bernard
Picchi, a securities analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
   "The big negative factor is chemicals," Mr. Picchi said.
   Petrochemical profits were exceptionally high in the 1989
first half but have plummeted since that time. Weakened
demand and rapid overbuilding of capacity have created a glut
of many chemicals. Ethylene, for instance, a commodity
petrochemical used to make more sophisticated materials, now
sells for around 24 cents a pound, 22% below the year-ago
price.
   The rapid decline in chemical prices had even sparked some
industry concern that a long-term drop might be in the works.
For the moment, it appears that isn't happening. "Prices have
leveled off and come back up some," Sir Peter Holmes,
chairman of Shell Transport &amp; Trading, said. "We don't expect
to see the early '80s happening again" when a glut drove the
industry into a depression.
   The chief beneficial factor for oil company results in the
just-ended period was the price of crude, which averaged
around $19.50 a barrel, up $3 from a year ago.
   Natural gas prices rose only slighty, disappointing many
companies that were hoping last winter that gas would break
out of its long price depression. Gas supplies were extremely
tight during the freeze in December and prices shot up, but
then the weather suddenly became warmer-than-normal, and
prices tumbled back down even faster.
   Gasoline refining and marketing margins in the first
quarter were anemic. "They were very weak early in the
quarter and didn't come back much," Frederick Leuffer, a
securities analyst at C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.,
said. Margins were also weak in the 1989 first quarter, so
refining results will be flat to slightly lower.
   For the current quarter, refining and marketing is the
industry's big profit question mark. "Right now, margins are
low," said a spokesman for USX Corp. "But I would expect
margins this summer to improve."
   That feeling isn't universal, however. Crude prices have
been falling lately, which generally helps margins because
oil is the feedstock for gasoline refining. But many industry
economists think gasoline demand for the critical summer
driving season could be weaker than it was last year,
countering that possible margin improvement.
   Meanwhile, most oil company exploration and production
earnings probably won't compare well with last year's second
quarter. "We're in that weak demand part of the season and
{crude oil} prices could drop another $1 or $2," from current
levels, said Eugene Nowak, a securities analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   On the other hand, comparable year-ago prices were
unusually high for the period, breaking the seasonal pattern
in part because of the Alaskan oil spill and disruptions in
the British North Sea. Those events temporarily reduced the
supply of certain desirable crudes, driving prices up during
much of the quarter. In last year's second quarter, in fact,
some crude prices eclipsed $24 a barrel. Currently, they are
around $19 a barrel.

   Donald E. Salyers, formerly general manager sales, was

   WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department ruled that Mexican
companies are exporting hydraulic cement to the U.S. at
unfairly low prices.
   The preliminary anti-dumping decision will require
importers of Mexican cement and clinker, an intermediate
material, to post bonds or make cash payments to cover
penalty duties that may be assessed later.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The department's final ruling is due by June 19, after
which the U.S. International Trade Commission would decide
within 45 days whether the imports were injuring a domestic
industry. If both findings are affirmative, penalty duties
would be assessed.
   The department said the imports of cement and clinker
totaled about $111 million last year. The dumping margins,
and thus the potential duties, range as high as 56.68% for
cement produced by Cemex S.A.. The margin is 51.73% for
Apasco S.A. de C.V. and 51.16% for most other companies.
However, one Mexican producer, Cementos Hidalgo S.C.L.,
hasn't exported cement or clinker to the U.S. at unfairly low
prices, the agency said.
   Under the Anti-Dumping Act, the Commerce Department can
find a violation if imports are reaching the U.S. market at
prices below the producer's home-market price for the same
products.

   BOSTON -- A U.S. District Court judge here said he expects
by Wednesday to rule on a suit by BTR PLC seeking to block
Norton Co. from delaying its annual meeting.
   BTR, a London-based international conglomerate, last month
made a $75-a-share, or $1.64 billion, hostile bid for Norton,
a Worcester, Mass., maker of abrasives and engineering
materials. Norton rejected the bid as inadequate and delayed
its annual meeting to June 26 from April 26, saying it wanted
more time to consider its options.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   BTR then sued Norton to have the canceled meeting
reinstated for April 26, charging that Norton's management
plans to use the delay to "change Norton's shareholder base"
in order to win an expected proxy fight. Norton said it would
vigorously defend against the suit and filed a countersuit to
enjoin BTR's tender offer and to stop BTR from soliciting
proxies.
   In a hearing Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Joseph
Tauro said he hopes to issue a ruling on the annual meeting
date by Wednesday.
   BTR earlier said it would start a proxy fight to unseat
Norton's board "quite soon" if it prevails in its suit to
reinstate Norton's original annual meeting date. BTR
indicated it wouldn't proceed with its planned proxy fight
for some weeks if the new meeting date were allowed to stand.

   TV: Lurid Vision of Small-Town America

   Set in the wild and beautiful Pacific Northwest, where the
mists hang over the treetops like a guillotine over a
condemned man, "Twin Peaks" (ABC, Thursdays, 9 p.m. EDT) is
the most startlingly idiosyncratic vision on TV today --
concocted by movie director David Lynch ("Eraserhead," "Blue
Velvet") and Mark Frost ("Hill Street Blues").
   In rural Washington state, Twin Peaks is a town of diners
and gas stations and high-school love affairs, a town where
"a yellow light still means slow down, not speed up." When
the region is shaken by the shocking murder of a high-school
homecoming queen, FBI special agent Dale Cooper (Kyle
MacLachlan) and local sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael
Ontkean) are called in to investigate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Beneath the surface of this peaceful, scenic logging
community, they discover a Pandora's boxful of lust, greed,
hatred and illicit passion. And over the next several weeks,
as the series unrolls, they find that everyone seems to be
having affairs with everyone else, and several Twin Peaks
residents are engaged in behavior either illegal or bizarre.
   As anyone who's seen "Blue Velvet" knows, this is David
Lynch's world, a world at once mundane and lurid -- as
commonplace as apple pie, as deviant and twisted as razor
blades in Halloween apples. In Twin Peaks, there's the
high-school football team and the motorcycle gang, but it's
the bikers who turn out to be the good guys, while the
football stars are thoroughly rotten young men.
   Laura Palmer, the lovely cheerleader who's been killed,
had, in fact, been mixed up in porno films and cocaine deals
before her death. Expectations are constantly being
subverted: Fish turn up in coffee percolators; a strange old
woman wanders around town talking to a pet log.
   The central character, FBI Agent Cooper, is just as
wide-eyed and as cynical as Mr. Lynch himself. Cooper may be
naively enthusiastic about cherry pie and the smell of
Douglas fir trees, but he's sharp about his case. His mind
leaps ahead of the sincere local sheriff Truman as they
search for a serial killer who's murdered at least two women
and raped and tortured a third.
   As he investigates, Cooper always has a running monologue
going into a pocket tape recorder, a list of clues for his
secretary to type up ("Diane, I'm holding in my hand a box of
chocolate bunnies"). He's the kind of guy who asks for his
bacon "super crispy -- cremated."
   At the beginning of this week's episode, we find him
hanging upside down from a gravity bar, talking about "the
true test of any hotel, that morning cup of coffee," and
wondering about the one thing that still troubles him, not
just as an FBI man, but as a human being -- "what really went
on between Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys?"
   If all this seems a little surreal, it's only because it
is. As reviewers have struggled to describe "Twin Peaks,"
they've been reduced to odd hybrid comparisons -- "Our Town"
by Franz Kafka, "Dark Shadows" meets "Falcon Crest." The best
description was by an ABC executive who called it "Norman
Rockwell Meets Salvador Dali," but even that's a little off.
   Instead of Dali, I would have picked Giorgio De Chirico,
surrealist painter of "The Sinister Muses." In his empty,
brooding pictures, there are strange shadows, the same aura
of danger that lies at the heart of "Twin Peaks."
   What Mr. Lynch does so well is to imbue something as
ordinary as small-town America with an inchoate threat, an ax
waiting to fall. In short, "Twin Peaks" is creepy. As Angelo
Badalamenti's music lurks underneath -- all cool and ominous
and 1950s vibes plus fingersnaps -- Mr. Lynch's camera will
rest on everyday objects: a fan, a fallen stag's head, even
an expressionless face. He'll focus in for three seconds,
four, five, six, so long it becomes positively unsettling.
Mr. Lynch understands the chilling quality of emptiness. Like
Harold Pinter, he knows that menace hangs in the silences.
   Even a conversation about curtains turns strangely
threatening: "Do you know what I was doing? . . . I was
inventing a noiseless, completely silent drape runner. And do
you know how it works, do you know what makes it work, the
thing that I thought of at four this morning when I was
waiting for my husband to be released from intensive care?
Cotton balls] By God, those things'll be quiet now]"
   Full of surprises and richly textured, "Twin Peaks" has a
level of production quality more commonly associated with a
feature film. But it is a quintessential TV product. Half
soap opera, half murder mystery, "Twin Peaks" co-opts, and
transforms, the two television genres. There are zillions of
characters (with a cast that includes Piper Laurie, Peggy
Lipton, Joan Chen, Dana Ashbrook, Lara Flynn Boyle, James
Marshall, Russ Tamblyn, Sherilyn Fenn) and almost as many
subplots. This is a vast, sprawling story, as tangled as any
soap, as packed with secret motives as any detective yarn.
   "Twin Peaks" is, however, more unforgiving than most TV
drama. It may take weeks just to get a sense of who all the
characters are and what's going on. And the mystery, instead
of getting clearer, just keeps getting murkier and murkier.
   But I'll tell you this: After two episodes, "Twin Peaks"
is riveting. And it's so cool, it's chilly.

   BOSTON -- Three dissident shareholders of Grove Bank for
Savings said in a filing with the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. that they intend to propose a resolution at the June 7
annual meeting calling for the sale of the bank.
   James B. Rosenwald and John H. and James J. Pinto -- who
own 8.16% of Grove Bank's 1.5 million shares outstanding --
said in a letter to the bank that they also intend to
recommend an increase in board membership from 15 to 19
directors because the current board isn't "maximizing the
value of shareholders' investment."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dissidents said they will nominate to the board Mr.
Rosenwald, chief executive officer of Rosenwald Partners L.P.
in Redondo Beach, Calif.; John Pinto, co-chief executive of
Churchill Associates L.P. of New York, N.Y.; Christopher P.
Sullivan, a lawyer; and Richard L. Morgenstern, a lawyer.
   Daniel Calore, treasurer of Grove, said, "The executive
committee of the board is planning to meet with this group
shortly. We really don't think we can comment until we sit
down and talk with them."
   For 1989, Grove Bank reported net of $1.3 million, or 88
cents a share, compared with 1988 net of $1.6 million, or
$1.06 a share. The company had assets of $211.4 million as of
Dec. 31.

   Analyst projections that Valmont Industries Inc. will
report per-share net income in the range of 33 cents to 36
cents for its first quarter, ended April 1, represent a "fair
estimate," William F. Welsh II, president and chief executive
officer, said.
   Those results would equal or fall slightly below the
Omaha, Neb., company's year-ago net of $4.2 million, or 36
cents a share, on revenue of $189.4 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Valmont makes irrigation systems, industrial products
including steel poles and tubing, and additionally holds an
82% stake in ValCom Inc., a reseller of personal computers.
   The company's irrigation business will have an "excellent
year" in 1990, but "not quite as strong" as it has been in
the past couple of years, when drought conditions spurred
sales in the Farm Belt, Mr. Welsh said in an interview. The
improved health of the general farm economy this year, he
said, will help offset the absence of a "drought situation."
Domestic demand remains "strong," he said, adding that the
company's export market -- which covers some 70 nations -- is
also "quite good."

about 53% consists of U S West Communications debt
obligations. Moreover, S&amp;P said U S West has been
diversifying into higher-risk ventures, such as financial
services and cellular telephone. S&amp;P also attributed the
downgrade to increasing business risk in the company's

   Thornburgh Shows Unusual Amount
   Of Interest in Foreign-Policy Projects

</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- To his policeman's hat and bureaucrat's
green eye shade, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has added
the diplomat's black bowler.
   In the coming issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, Mr.
Thornburgh holds forth on "The Soviet Union and the Rule of
Law." The article is replete with allusions to his personal
mission last year to Moscow, where he preached to Soviet
leaders about the values of the U.S. legal system. In
frequent speeches, the attorney general contends that
Washington has an obligation to export our legal principles
to fertilize democracy movements in the East.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Anything that we can do to expostulate upon our own
experience, and to share with . . . the framers . . . of
these nascent constitutions, I think will be in our long-term
interest," he told a meeting of the Federalist Society, a
conservative legal group based here.
   Beyond proselytizing, Mr. Thornburgh has dedicated himself
to a number of foreign-policy projects that are unusual in
scope and variety for an attorney general to undertake. He
has helped orchestrate Senate approval of treaties to
facilitate cooperative law enforcement efforts with other
countries. He has visited numerous foreign counterparts to
apply personal pressure in attempts to ease foreign-bank
secrecy and extradition rules. And at home, he is supervising
a rethinking of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's foreign
counterintelligence strategies in light of the opening of
relations with previously hostile East European nations.
   Mr. Thornburgh's efforts add up to "building the
infrastructure for international law enforcement," says his
top aide, Robert Ross. Translated from the bureaucratese,
that means scrambling to keep up with high-tech criminals who
are no longer limited by national borders and who can
transfer ill-gotten gains from one bank account to another
just by punching a computer key.
   Some observers are impressed by the attorney
general-turned-diplomat. "I'd give him a good grade," says
Barry Carter, an international law professor at Georgetown
University and a Democrat. "He clearly surpasses {Reagan
administration Attorney General Edwin} Meese, who took a lot
of junkets but really didn't distinguish himself in this
area."
   Mr. Carter has one main concern: the Thornburgh Justice
Department's determination that the FBI can snatch U.S.
fugitives in foreign countries without getting the host
government's permission. "If we were to act unilaterally in
that fashion, we could undermine a lot of cooperation," says
the professor.
   Others are suspicious of Mr. Thornburgh's motives, noting
his much-discussed ambition for higher office. Referring to
the attorney general's busy schedule of international travel,
Jack Blum, an international lawyer and former special counsel
to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says, "It makes
him look like a vice presidential candidate."
   Mr. Blum's former boss, Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.),
praises the Bush administration's anti-drug diplomacy, but he
argues that some Justice Department projects abroad are
ill-advised. He points to Operation Snowcap, in which armed
U.S. agents are leading paramilitary helicopter squads to
destroy cocaine facilities in the Peruvian and Bolivian
jungles.
   "This has the makings of another Vietnam," says the
lawmaker. "You leave a lot of people hanging out there and
taking a lot of risks without the resources or the strategy
to win."
   There is, however, widespread agreement that some
countries are cooperating more with U.S. law enforcement, at
least in part because of Mr. Thornburgh's international
offensive. His pressure helped prompt Swiss authorities to
honor their earlier treaty agreements and open previously
secret bank accounts where international drug dealers stash
their profits.
   The attorney general also played a role in convincing the
Colombian government to begin extraditing people facing U.S.
drug charges. After years of inaction from Bogota, 15 members
of Colombian cocaine trafficking organizations have been
extradited since last summer.
   Critics point out that these defendants aren't Colombia's
top drug lords and therefore are easily replaced by the
cartel heads. But Mark Richard, a senior career official in
the Justice Department's criminal division, contends that
"even the level of success we've had breaks the pattern of
rhetoric with little action."

   NEW YORK -- Two Connecticut thrift holding companies,
Eagle Financial Corp. and Webster Financial Corp., ended
their agreement to merge, citing "the deterioration of the
region's economy and the uncertainties of the regulatory
environment."
   In the merger, each share of Eagle Financial, which is
based in Bristol, Conn., was to be converted into 0.95 share
of the new holding company. Each share of Webster, based in
Waterbury, Conn., was to become one share of the new firm.

   The companies announced the pact in October and
definitively agreed on it two months later. The banks
emphasized that each has capital exceeding regulatory
requirements, but they said the merger wouldn't be in the
best interests of the companies or their shareholders right
now.
   With assets of $708.5 million at Dec. 31, Webster is the
parent of First Federal Savings &amp; Loan of Waterbury. Eagle,
with assets of $472.3 million on that date, holds Bristol
Federal Savings Bank and First Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Association of Torrington.

   Letters to the Editor:
   It All Begins With Illiteracy
</HL>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A13
</SO>
<LP>
   Not once in "Here's The Bad News on The Underclass"
(editorial page, March 8) does Charles Murray mention the
primary reason for nonparticipation by many young black men
in the U.S. labor force. It is illiteracy. More than 40 out
of 100 American blacks leave school after six to 12 years,
unable to make sense out of printed pages or labels. And it
is a reasonable guess that 30 to 35 out of that 40 are young
black men.
   Thirty-five years ago, Rudolph Flesch (doctorate from
Teachers College at Columbia University) told us in "Why
Johnny Can't Read" that four out of five who cannot learn to
read with whole-word recognition or "see and say" reading
instruction (used in 80% to 90% of our first-, second- and
third-grade classes since 1950) are males. That is why the
title of his best seller did not include "Jane."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Single mothers, low income and increased crime may
accompany unemployment, but they do not cause it. Illiteracy
produces unemployment, single mothers, low incomes and
increased crime. Illiterate black men, unable to support
themselves, do not marry the mothers of their children.
Young, illiterate black men, unable to hold legal jobs, often
take illegal jobs. Literacy is not a requirement for selling
drugs. Crime bosses are among the few equal-opportunity
employers for illiterates.
   Black leaders must stop blaming whites, and white leaders
must stop blaming society for unemployed and unemployable
young black illiterate men. Both groups should look at the
majority-black, English-speaking islands of Barbados,
Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Caymans, St. Helena,
Ascension, Trinidad and Dominica for a solution. For these
are all islands where 95% to 98% out of 100 blacks can read
just about anything they want to read. And literacy produces
employment just as surely as illiteracy produces
unemployment.
   In his 1983 book, "The Economics of Politics and Race,"
Thomas Sowell notes that black families in the U.S. from the
West Indies produce almost 40% higher incomes than black
families from any state in America. Why? Caribbean blacks
have similar genetic and historical backgrounds. The British
abolished slavery in the West Indies and Bermuda only 34
years before the Civil War ended it in the U.S.
   The answer must be that British-trained teachers in those
islands have never stopped teaching children to read by
matching sounds with letters that spell sounds. They never
abandoned phonics. They never adopted "see and say" -- which,
according to Mr. Murray, apparently doesn't work well for
young white males either. For 20 out of 100 young white men
are in that same unbudgeable, unemployed and unemployable
group -- the illiterate young men who don't even ask for
jobs.

   U.S. Must Lead the World Into '90s
   ----
   By Gregory A. Fossedal

</SO>
<LP>
   Democracy is transforming the globe, yet a curious
consensus holds that the U.S. -- the oldest, richest and
prototypically successful democracy -- is declining. Paul
Kennedy and the New York Review of Books brigade see a
pitiful giant awash in deficits and overcommitments. Pat
Buchanan and many National Review types doubt there can ever
be a meaningful reform of communism, or even that democracy
is a good thing. And those in the center, such as George
Bush, while certainly favoring the tide of freedom, see the
U.S. role in its extension as that of a prep-school
cheerleader: Hooray for Gorbachev and Deng, but don't expect
us to do anything serious to influence them.
   Joseph Nye's "Bound to Lead" (Basic Books, 307 pages,
$19.95) is a potent tonic for this malaise: a brisk
counterassertion that the U.S. is, and likely will remain,
the most powerful country on Earth. With so many questioning
whether America even has substantial leverage, "Bound to
Lead" delivers a critical face-slap to the waning-empire
hand-wringers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the first five chapters, Mr. Nye coolly analyzes the
hard numbers on the history of declining powers, the relative
position of the U.S. today, and the standing of our likely
rivals: the Soviet Union, China, Japan and Europe. By many
macroeconomic measures, such as gross national product, or
various indices of technical innovation, Mr. Nye notes, the
U.S. has held its own and even advanced in the 1980s. Only
when compared with the years just after World War II does the
U.S. register substantial reduction. And one could hardly
expect or even want our unusual position in 1945 to remain
frozen.
   The U.S. "personal savings rate," he admits, has dropped
-- but it is a hollow statistic that excludes many types of
investment in the future, such as spending for education or a
rise in stock prices. When these are factored in, "U.S.
capital formation comes to 30% of GNP," roughly the average
(34%) of 10 other leading industrial countries. Likewise, the
trade deficits that hypnotize decline-mongerers reflect an
influx of foreign investment, most of it counted as
"imports," as well as a reduction in imprudent loans abroad,
which showed up as 1970s "exports."
   But no sooner has Mr. Nye debunked some of these bogus
aggregates than he, alas, picks up some of their baggage. He
harps on the U.S. budget deficit as a major problem; yet it
is not huge compared with that of most countries. He pins the
U.S. deficit, in turn, largely on tax-rate cuts that in fact
brought in a gush of revenues, particularly from the wealthy.
Mr. Nye seems to favor many of the high-tax, special-subsidy
schemes that in the '70s really did cause U.S. decline.
   A political scientist, Mr. Nye is especially cogent when
he considers the subtle, indirect uses of power. He argues
that the U.S. and other countries will have to rely
increasingly on "soft" or "co-optive" power: getting other
countries not so much to do things they don't want, but
rather, actually to want the same things we do. In recent
years, he contends, military and covert action, and even
blatant economic coercion, have been rendered less usable for
all powers by such forces as the nuclear threat, economic
interdependence, technology's diffusion, and the extension of
democratic forms and ideals.
   In many ways, the U.S. is uniquely well-situated for this
new world. Unlike Japan, we have a pluralistic society that
readily absorbs immigrants, products, new ideas. Unlike the
Soviets, we have a basically healthy polity, economy and
ideology that are envied, not loathed, by most of the world.
   Mr. Nye's concluding discussion of options for U.S. policy
seems, by contrast, flat and conventional. He seems reluctant
to consider dismantling U.S. forces in Europe, though this
would save about $100 billion a year in an age of resource
pressures. Nor do the final chapters have much to say about
rebuilding Eastern Europe economically, or the fragile
democracies of the Third World. Here we are, with several
billion people balanced on the margin between freedom and
slavery -- and Mr. Nye seems more focused on "drug traffic,
AIDS, global warming and other problems."
   Indeed, while pleading for "long-run thinking," "Bound to
Lead" provides little in the way of a central, animating
vision as to how all this U.S. influence ought to be used. If
leaders are to execute the consistent diplomacy whose absence
Mr. Nye and other intellectuals bemoan, and if voters are to
support it, then intellectuals must do a better job
propounding principles and standards.
   Mr. Nye makes up for his weak summation, however, with his
well-documented central message: If power is considered in
its broad, ideopolitical manifestations, the U.S. enters the
1990s as the world's greatest single player. No, we can't
absolutely determine that, say, Poland or Brazil will emerge
as stable democracies. But we will have much to say about it.
In alerting us to this awesome responsibility, "Bound to
Lead" may help us to discharge it efficaciously.

   A Sofa's Journey:
   In the Quest
   For EC Comfort

   BRUSSELS -- For those moving house across Europe in these
pre-1992 days, here is a cautionary tale. And, be warned,
post-1992 might not be much better.
   Andy Ashton, a 27-year-old marketing manager with a major
Dutch multinational, decided he preferred English sofas to
Dutch ones and opted to import one from the London Sofa Bed
Center. By chance, an old friend from college, Paul Horrell,
was coming to visit Mr. Ashton and had a van at his disposal.
Mr. Ashton's cheapest quote for getting the sofa to Holland
by a moving company had been around 700 guilders ($366); a
friend with a van seemed an attractive alternative.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Horrell's problems began at Dover, where he had a T2
freight form filled in by A&amp;G Freight Services (Dover) Ltd.
A&amp;G charged #25 ($40.15) for this initial bout with
bureaucracy; they then informed a bemused Mr. Horrell that he
would have to part with a further #75 for a "European
Community Guarantee." While the T2 described what the goods
were and where they were going, the guarantee is a form of
bond that ensures they get there. Filling out both took at
least an hour.
   Mr. Horrell, complete with sofa, T2 and EC Guarantee, was
then directed down the freight lane to a weighbridge. "Then
came more problems," he says. "I was told that my tourist
ticket was completely invalid." Mr. Horrell was reclassified
as freight, which cost him another #80 and another twenty
minutes. Next Mr. Horrell had to go through customs -- he
just made the 10.30 p.m. sailing.
   The French showed little interest in the sofa, but at the
Belgian border yet another form was produced. The officer
wanted five Belgian francs, but settled instead for 20
English pence. At 4 a.m. Mr. Ashton's English sofa approached
the final frontier: the Dutch border.
   Gerlach, a Dutch freight agency, wanted to see the T2, the
EC Guarantee and the VAT invoice from the London Sofa Bed
Center -- the Dutch VAT had already been paid. An hour later
an official returned with an EC Trust Receipt and a customs
clearance document.
   At 7 a.m. Mr. Ashton, who lives in Amsterdam, at last had
his sofa. Understandably, he has few volunteers for his next
furniture shipment.
   Will all this change in 1992? "I think it's not very clear
at the moment," says Gordon Goodacre, director of A&amp;G in
Dover. Though sympathetic, he terms Mr. Horrell's plight "a
one-off incident."
   Querenus Van As, a Dutch customs clearing officer, is
pessimistic. "In theory, yes, things should be easier by
'92," he says. "But nobody believes we'll be ready in two
years. It's not easy to get rid of so much paperwork."
   Mr. Ashton points out that despite the myriad forms that
had to be filled in, and the amount of time spent at borders,
no one ever inspected the sofa. "There are some things you
don't check," says Mr. Van As. "Everybody knows a sofa."
   In Brussels, the European Commission is trying to unravel
customs restrictions, but is facing strong resistance from
national customs authorities, whose bureaucrats are afraid of
losing their jobs and "raison d'etre". "Of course it will be
easier after 1992," a Commission spokesman says. "Everybody
will be able to buy things where they want and take them to
their state of residence." But he has little sympathy for
those contemplating moving objects like sofas themselves.
"It's rather unusual to travel with a sofa."
   In which case is he implying that people should pay the
heavy costs asked by international moving companies? "They're
much quicker," he suggests. Ever helpful, he notes that Mr.
Ashton made more work for himself by paying English VAT on
the sofa. "If you start a process in the wrong way then it's
a mess to emerge from," he says. But a check with the sofa
bed dealer confirms that Mr. Ashton had no choice in paying
English VAT: "Shops of our size have to charge the VAT. It's
only the major department stores that have the means to
deduct VAT."
   Meanwhile Mr. Ashton, anxious to claim his English VAT
back, is surrounded by forms. The Sofa Bed Center is
demanding the Community transit receipt, stamped at both
Dover and Hazeldonk and numerous other tax forms. So far he
has sent eight separate forms to London, but at least retains
some humor: "With all the paper I've got to sit on I needn't
have bought a sofa in the first place."

   In your Feb. 21 Law-column item "Declaring Insolvency
Called a Bad Solution," St. Louis lawyer Donald B. Kramer
asserts that filing a bankruptcy petition can be a terrible
error.
   With proper counsel, bankruptcy is a sound and effective
strategy and can be beneficial, improving one's
credit-worthiness and reputation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Kramer's assertion suffers basic flaws:
   A Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition can be filed only once
every seven years. In most bankruptcies, the debtor gets a
"clean slate" and thus is a more attractive candidate for
credit. While filing a bankruptcy petition may result in a
temporary "black mark," the benefits outweigh the negatives.
   Mr. Kramer implies that all problems can be worked out
amicably. However, many times it is either impossible or far
too costly in terms of legal fees to negotiate with
credit-card companies. If creditors established "workout
departments" specifically for consumer debts -- similar to
the departments that exist for commercial loans -- the
likelihood of amicable resolutions might be increased.

   Your Money Matters:
   Municipal Bonds Are Tempting, but Is It Time to Buy?

<LP>
   With the April 16 tax-filing deadline fast approaching,
brokerage houses and mutual funds are inundating investors
with sales pitches for municipal bonds.
   Their message: Start collecting high tax-free yields and
stop paying all that money to the government.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That can seem awfully tempting, especially for investors
in high-tax states like California and New York. Many
municipal bonds now offer yields equivalent to more than 10%
on taxable investments for people in the 28% bracket. The
taxable-equivalent yield can be even higher when state and
local taxes are taken into account.
   But while municipal bonds have a place in the portfolios
of many investors, bond strategists warn that the $784
billion muni market can be much trickier and riskier than it
looks. And while this could be the time for selective buying,
some say investors who hold back may find even bigger rewards
later.
   The average yield on an index of 20 long-term "general
obligation" bonds, which are backed by the taxing authority
of the states and local governments that issue them, is
currently around 7.3%, according to the Bond Buyer, a trade
publication. That's about 86% of the yield on comparable
Treasury bonds.
   Last November, however, the average yield was around 92%
of the return on Treasurys. Some analysts advise postponing
buying long-term municipals until that percentage rises back
to about 90%. "Long-term municipals generally are not a
bargain right now," says Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice
president at Gabriele, Hueglin &amp; Cashman.
   The gap between municipal-bond and Treasury yields has
widened since last fall because muni yields haven't risen as
fast as Treasury yields. This reflects a scant supply of
munis at a time of continued heavy Treasury-bond issuance.
But the volume of new municipal bond sales is expected to
pick up soon, which some analysts say will push muni yields
up, narrowing the margin.
   Several analysts are also unenthusiastic about short-term
municipal bonds, those due in a year or less and found in the
portfolios of tax-exempt money-market mutual funds. Yields on
these issues, they say, aren't significantly better than U.S.
Treasury bill yields after taking federal income taxes into
account.
   For example, six-month Treasury bills now pay around 8.2%,
while comparable short-term municipal notes yield about 6%,
according to Neal Attermann, head of municipal-bond research
at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. That's equivalent to a Treasury
yield of 8.3% for someone in the 28% bracket, and about 9%
for those in the 33% bracket. Although interest on T-bills is
taxable at the federal level, it's tax-free at the state and
local levels.
   Intermediate-term munis, those due in seven to 15 years,
could be a better choice right now, some analysts say. That's
because intermediate-term bonds now pay nearly the same
returns as long-term bonds, while their prices generally
fluctuate less in the secondary market. For example,
triple-A-rated bonds due in 2005 yield about 7%, while those
due in 2020 yield less than two-tenths of a percentage point
more, according to Municipal Market Data Inc. in Boston. For
an investor with $10,000, that represents a difference of
only $15 a year.
   Many investment strategists also urge investors to stick
with top-quality municipal bonds and shun most low-rated
issues. "The lesson is go for quality," says James S. Tisch,
executive vice president at Loews Corp. "The reason is the
{yield} spreads are so narrow" between top-quality and
lower-quality bonds that investors aren't getting paid for
the added risk.
   For example, a typical triple-A-rated bond due in 20 years
now yields about 7.10%. That is only about half a percentage
point less than some Baa-rated bonds.
   "Individuals should buy only bonds that are rated double-A
or better," says Christine Carter Lynch, a municipal-bond
money manager and managing editor of Lynch Municipal Bond
Advisory, a New York-based monthly newsletter. "The
risk-reward ratio just isn't there" to justify buying
lower-rated issues. She says the "most attractive" municipal
bonds available now are "pre-refunded bonds," backed by U.S.
Treasury securities placed in escrow to pay their principal
and interest.
   Credit quality is likely to become even more important in
coming months. Municipal-finance specialists expect more
state and local governments to encounter budget headaches
because of the economy's continued sluggishness. That could
further depress prices of those bonds trading in the
secondary market. Prices of Massachusetts and New York bonds
already have taken a pounding in recent months because of
those states' fiscal woes.
   Analysts also are leery of many hospital and health-care
bonds. Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered ratings for
seven nonprofit hospitals in this year's first quarter, while
upgrading only one. "The trend reflects a continuation of the
deteriorating financial condition of the hospital industry,"
the credit-rating agency said recently.
   Says Peter J.D. Gordon, managing director and head of the
municipal-bond division at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.: "I
certainly would advise investors to stay away from
health-care and nursing-home issues."
   Investors considering municipal bonds should remember that
they have some important drawbacks. Most municipals can be
"called," or redeemed early, and even professional analysts
occasionally are taken by surprise. Bond calls usually are
bad news for investors who think they've locked up attractive
yields until a bond's scheduled maturity. The number of
municipal-bond calls is expected to surge in coming years, as
issuers float new bonds to pay off older, higher-yielding
debt.
   Buying and selling municipals and keeping track of their
prices can also be a problem. There are more than one million
different issues, and most of them don't trade often. As a
result, some municipal-bond specialists recommend buying
pieces of large bond issues, which often are more actively
traded on the secondary markets.
   Harvey Spiro, a Los Angeles investment manager recently
bought some municipal bonds for himself. "If you want
marketability and liquidity," he advises, "stick to large
issues."

   The Drug War in the Halls of Justice

   When President Bush decides to deliver another "War on
Drugs" speech to the nation, it may not be necessary for the
Drug Enforcement Agency to stage a drug buy at Lafayette
Park. Perhaps all the president has to do is phone Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh and ask him to step outside his
office and into the halls of the Justice Department.
   Late last month, on a trip to Washington, I found myself
at the Justice Department, about to attend a meeting a floor
below Mr. Thornburgh's office. Upon entering the building,
like all visitors, I provided some identification and stated
the purpose of the visit and the office at which I was
expected. After those details were recorded and verified, I
passed through a metal detector and my belongings were
checked by an X-ray machine. I completed the security check
and continued on my way to my meeting, in the firm belief
that the building must be one of the most crime-free in the
capital.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   I was very tired that day and it must have showed. The
Justice Department headquarters is a rather large and complex
building, and it is easy to get lost in its long corridors.
As I was rounding one corner, I saw packages and boxes out of
the corner of my eye and a person who seemed to approach me
from this area suddenly moved and blocked my way. Imagine my
shock and surprise when this rather thin, casually dressed
young man who appeared to be in his 20s said, "Wanna fix?" I
was so startled, I stopped and stared. He repeated his
question while taking something out of his pocket and quickly
opened his palm revealing a small, shiny white square.
Dumbfounded, I made no reply but instinctively moved out of
his way and down the corridor to the first open doorway of an
office suite seeking help.
   As I walked outraged into the room, the full impact of
what had just happened dawned on me, and I said to the people
in the office that somebody had tried to sell me drugs just
outside their office in the corridor. They didn't seem
surprised, nor shocked, nor did they feel impelled to do
anything. Their response simply was, "Really?" When I
suggested that they check the corridor and see if he was
still there, I got no response. They were not interested and
went on with their work as though nothing had happened. When
I was able to get myself collected, I left their office and
continued on my way.
   Later I called the office responsible for security in the
Justice Department and gave it the details of the incident.
When I inquired if something like this had ever been reported
before, the answer was no. The security people, however, were
very anxious to take down the details of what had happened.
   I suppose it is possible that I was the victim of a prank.
But Bush administration officials have just admitted that the
war on drugs has been a failure in the streets of Washington.
Perhaps it has failed in the corridors of power as well. If
one can be offered drugs in the halls of the Justice
Department in Washington, it seems reasonable to suspect that

   Cambior Inc. is "very actively" seeking acquisitions,
Louis Gignac, president and chief executive officer, said
after a presentation to analysts in Montreal.
   Mr. Gignac said the Val D'Or, Quebec, gold mining concern
would prefer to make one major acquisition rather than a
number of smaller purchases and is particularly interested in
buying a U.S. gold property. He said that with more than 100
million Canadian dollars (US$86 million) in cash Cambior can
consider an acquisition of around C$200 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gignac said Cambior's objective is to roughly double
its gold production to about 500,000 ounces annually by the
end of 1994 from a forecast 220,000 ounces this year.

   CURRAGH RESOURCES Inc., a closely held mining concern,

public offering of shares to raise gross proceeds of about
$80 million (U.S.). The Toronto-based company said it will
offer 6,250,000 subordinate voting shares from its treasury
at about $13 each. In addition, it said Australia's Giant
Resources Ltd., which owns 44% of Curragh, will sell
2,750,000 shares, reducing its stake to about 21%. Adrian
White, Curragh's executive vice president, finance, said the
company will assist Giant in selling privately the rest of
its Curragh shares as part of Giant's previously reported
plan to dispose of its Canadian mining assets. Giant is 43%
owned by Pioneer International Ltd., one of Australia's
biggest companies, which has announced plans to sell its
stake in Giant. The public offering represents about 27% of
Curragh's shares. Mr. White said Frame Mining Corp., a
company controlled by Clifford Frame, Curragh's chairman,
president and chief executive officer, will hold about 90% of
the voting power through its holding of Curragh multiple
voting shares. Mr. White said proceeds of the offering will
be used to repay long-term debt, which stood at 213 million
Canadian dollars (US$182.3 million) at Dec. 31. He said
Curragh also will probably issue $100 million (U.S.) in
debentures later this year.

   Manager's Journal:
   When `Corporate' and `Culture' Clash
   ----
   By Lionel Tiger
</HL>

<SO>

</SO>
<LP>
   The social sciences, including my discipline,
anthropology, have made it clear that any ambitious human
enterprise must take into account cultural variations among
groups. But the concept of cultural difference has been
over-applied and misapplied, particularly in the form of the
notion of "corporate culture."
   Too often, this concept has been an excuse for
inefficiency and managerial stupidity. When Ford had 22
levels of management and Toyota five, the difference was not
in corporate culture but in sheer competence. Is the
existence of the executive dining room upstairs from the
staff canteen also corporate culture? No -- it is simply an
unintelligent personnel practice and a sign of inappropriate
privilege that costs companies money in employee morale and
is likely to encourage executive complacency.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some background: Early in the history of anthropology
there were two complementary goals. One was to try to
understand "human nature" by studying the fossil record of
early humans and our physical evolution. The other was to
document and understand the enormous range and variety of
human social arrangements.
   In recent times the two goals have become largely
separated. The main energy of the discipline has been
concentrated on studying cultural variation and the
phenomenon of culture itself. Cultural relativity has been
elevated to a certainty -- virtually every social pattern is
taken to be of equal value, standing and naturalness to any
other. Even gender has been defined as a social construct,
and fierce antipathy greets anyone who asserts that some
measure of sex-related behavior has biological roots.
   Enter corporate culture. Of course, each business or other
human group may enjoy what William Whyte in "The Organization
Man" called "the unique spirit" of the organization. Members
of robust organizations share a sense that their group is
special and that a definite loyalty and spark unite people.
Such unique spirit makes groups fun, and offers people a
workplace with which they can identify and from which they
can draw both personal security and occupational challenge.
   The problem that concerns me does not arise from the
natural feelings of community that decent, sensible people
develop when they work toward a common goal. It emerges when
people confuse these healthy feelings with the managerial and
technical means employed to achieve that common goal. Ford's
22 layers of management were supported by a series of
entrenched practices that were not only ways of doing work
but also signs of affiliation to the group: "This is how we
do it at Ford." Or British Motors. Or U.S. Steel. Or General
Motors. Or any other organization that has had to change its
M.O. drastically to compete in a marketplace unforgiving of
fat, slack and imprecision in linking resources to
production.
   Simply put, undue confidence and complacency can be subtly
but consequentially supported by the agreeable notion of
corporate culture. It can inhibit the concrete steps
necessary to compete -- especially to compete with producers
who think their process through afresh and who do not confuse
loyalty to an organization with loyalty to its particular
practices and traditions.
   This is particularly compelling in manufacturing, because
a car is a car is a car; there are relatively few culturally
expressive ways of doing the actual work involved in making
one. Cultural relativism does not apply. Different
socio-productive patterns are not equally likely to yield
good cars at prices that suit the market. While it is a human
characteristic to try to keep things the same, technology is
immune to sentimental familiarity.
   Of course, strong values about internal moral order and
community relations do characterize many successful
enterprises. I recently had considerable contact with the
Toronto-based Four Seasons Hotels company while doing
research for a book. It was clear that this enterprise -- a
consistently innovative luxury hotel group -- functions
effectively because it treats its work as an expression of
both its social and financial responsibility. For example, it
is building a hotel in Nevis in the Caribbean, and after
Hurricane Hugo hit it organized a relief shipment that was
the first on the scene from any source, including government.
   All employees eventually hired, even dishwashers, are
interviewed some four times, finally by the general manager
of the hotel in which they will work. This system is designed
not only to find out about the potential employees but also
to let them know that the organization is concerned about
them personally. This surely contributes to a labor turnover
rate less than half the industry average. No one employed
five years or more can be dismissed without review by Isadore
Sharp, the chairman and CEO.
   My discussions with senior executives about the future
revealed that their predominating concern was less about the
company's external business environment -- will people
continue to sleep in their expensive rooms? -- than it was
about becoming complacent and thoughtlessly sanctimonious
about the company's current M.O. -- would its corporate
culture overwhelm its corporate success?
   The possibility that this would happen was reduced in the
late 1980s. As Mr. Sharp has said: "I sat down with every
senior person in the company. `This is what we stand for. If
you are not happy with it, this is the time to say so.' I had
to fire people right at the top." Now, company policies on
large initiatives and the tiny details on which good hotels
depend can be efficiently hammered out at weekly meetings of
senior managers at which no holds are barred, but during
which people know that they conclusively share a central
commitment to the company and its values. Corporate culture
is an attitude, not a structure. Evidently, the result works.

   New Management Works to Salvage
   Rotterdam Energy Futures Exchange
   ----

   ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands -- It seemed like a good idea
at the time.
   Rotterdam is a massive center for oil refining, trading
and shipping. Hence, it ought to have a thriving
energy-futures market, where the oil industry could hedge its
pricing risks and speculators could bet on the direction of
oil prices -- just as they do at exchanges in London, New
York and Singapore.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Such reasoning was rife when the Rotterdam Energy Futures
Exchange, or Roefex, opened for trading last Oct. 31. But
trading on the exchange started off modestly and quickly
slowed. Proximity to oil refineries and barges hasn't yet
proved an advantage; the customers Roefex wants to attract
have no trouble dealing with the established exchanges,
however distant.
   Now, a new management team is trying to revive the Roefex.
Robert Sandelowsky, who became managing director of the
exchange March 1, is visiting its legions of inactive
members, giving them pep talks and discussing how to generate
trading volume.
   Currently, the Roefex's contracts for crude oil and fuel
oil have ceased trading. For the gas oil (or heating oil)
contract, there is still a trickle of turnover. On a recent
day, the Roefex had 137 gas oil contracts outstanding,
compared with well over 30,000 on London's moderately
successful International Petroleum Exchange and more than
70,000 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   "People don't take time to look at the Roefex any more
because the volume isn't there," says Steve Rietbergen,
director of Anglo-Dutch Oil Services, London, whose firm had
traders on the Roefex floor for the first three weeks before
giving up. Only six traders remain on the floor.
   What went wrong? For one thing, the oil market has been
relatively quiet in recent months. But many oil traders say
the real problem is that the Roefex was ill-conceived and
poorly marketed.
   A common charge is that the Roefex failed to come up with
anything novel enough to tempt business away from London's
IPE, which opened in 1981. "They basically mirrored the
established market, the IPE," says Peter Coster, a senior oil
trader at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in London. In a minor novelty,
the Roefex offered the possibility of physical delivery
(rather than cash settlement) for its crude-oil contract, but
that idea already had flopped in London.
   The Roefex did manage to attract a huge number of members
-- 160 -- but few of them were active. Roefex seats were
priced so low-25,000 guilders (about $13,000) each, compared
with around $250,000 on the New York Mercantile Exchange --
that many traders apparently bought them merely on the chance
that the seat value would soar if Roefex took off.
   Critics both inside and outside the Roefex also say that
its original management team lacked experience in energy
futures. As a result, the critics say, some needlessly
cumbersome rules discouraged potential traders. Meanwhile,
some members were unhappy with the amount of time devoted to
the exchange by its chairman, Tjerk Westerterp, who also
heads the successful European Options Exchange in Amsterdam.
Mr. Westerterp spends only a small amount of his time at the
Roefex, traders say, and in the early days few decisions
could be made in his absence. Mr. Westerterp, who remains on
the Roefex board but has been eclipsed in day-to-day duties
by Mr. Sandelowsky, who would not comment.
   Many members are encouraged, however, by the look of the
new team. Mr. Sandelowsky also serves as the general manager
of the three-year-old Amsterdam Financial Futures Market and
is credited with having played a major role in its success.
Because the financial futures exchange now "is rolling on its
own power," Mr. Sandelowsky says, he has time to run the
Roefex as well.
   Mr. Sandelowsky, who plans to concentrate for now on
building up gas oil rather than the other two contracts, says
many members remain "quite positive" about the Roefex despite
the bleak performance so far. But he concedes that the
pressure is on: One of the leading floor traders says his
firm will cut its losses and pull out if trading volume
doesn't pick up within a few months.

   LOS ANGELES -- Carolco Pictures Inc. reported a 57% drop
in fourth-quarter earnings, as revenue from feature films
declined and operating costs soared.
   The Los Angeles entertainment concern posted net income of
$8.2 million, or 27 cents a share, down from $18.7 million,
or 63 cents a share, a year earlier, when box office receipts
from "Rambo III" boosted the bottom line. Revenue fell 1% to
$54.5 million from $54.9 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Feature-film revenue fell 10% to $41.5 million from $46.2
million. That decline was partly offset by higher revenue
from television syndication and other operations. Operating
costs nearly trebled in the latest quarter, to $7.1 million
from $2.5 million a year earlier.
   Also pushing earnings lower was a 69% plunge, to $2.2
million from $6.9 million, in contributions from Carolco's
48% stake in Live Entertainment Inc., a distributor of video
and music products. The drop at Live reflected higher
amortization of accounting goodwill and an increased taxrate.
   For the year, Carolco net fell 61% to $14 million, or 46
cents a share, from $35.5 million, or $1.15 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue dropped 13% to $143.1 million from $164.6
million.

   MONTREAL -- Hurt by substantially lower earnings at its
forest products subsidiary, Canadian Pacific Ltd.'s net
income this year "is going to be down from 1989" net from
continuing operations of 664.6 million Canadian dollars
(US$568.7 million) or C$2.09 (US$1.79) a share, said William
Stinson, chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   After a presentation to analysts, Mr. Stinson said that
while earnings at 79.7%-owned Canadian Pacific Forest
Products Ltd. will drop substantially, it's "too early to
tell on balance" how Canadian Pacific's other businesses will
perform.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Including income from discontinued operations, Canadian
Pacific had net income of C$745.2 million, or C$2.35 a share,
last year. Revenue was C$11.02 billion.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Canadian Pacific closed unchanged at $20.875.
   Mr. Stinson told analysts that first-quarter revenue was
up about 5% at wholly owned CP Rail, but earnings will be
"about flat with '89." He said grain traffic, which accounts
for about 25% of CP Rail's business, still isn't "up to the
levels anticipated."
   Mr. Stinson said 87.1%-owned PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd.
will report higher first-quarter earnings due to higher oil
prices. He said Canadian Pacific's Fording Coal Ltd. unit, is
"going to do better {in 1990} than the C$40 million after
tax" it earned in 1989.
   Canadian Pacific is a Montreal-based transportation,
natural-resources, telecommunications and real estate
concern.

   EAST AURORA, N.Y. -- Quaker Oats Co.'s Fisher-Price
division said as many as 20,000 Fisher-Price child car seats
made this year may be defective.
   Metal tongues, which go between the legs and connect with
shoulder safety straps, could break in a crash, Fisher-Price
said. It blamed the problem on a defective die at the
tongue's vendor, which Fisher-Price wouldn't identify.
</LP>

   Fisher-Price said it had received no reports of injuries
or deaths because of the defect. A spokeswoman said the
division has substantial reserves to cover potential
liability. The financial impact on the third quarter, just
ended, should be "minimal."
   Opting for a part replacement plan rather than a recall,
Fisher-Price is making available free modification kits that
include a new tongue and tools to install it.
   The suspect car seats are model 9101 sold during February
and March. Seats with an inspection sticker dated April 1990
or later meet government safety standards, the company said.
Those wishing modification kits should call 800-327-9980
during business hours, Fisher-Price said.

   Enterprise:
   Manischewitz Criticized for Staying in Lucrative Niche

   Matzo Maker Isn't Exploiting Year-Round
   Demand for New Kosher Products

   B. Manischewitz Co.'s burst in sales every Passover used
to seem like a blessing. Lately it seems more like a plague.
   The Jersey City, N.J., company's Passover business has
drawn the kind of attention no enterprise wants: from a
federal prosecutor brandishing criminal antitrust charges and
from investors hoping for a management ouster.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The matzo maker has denied the charges and promised
prosperity and growth. But some investors and analysts and
the only outside director of Manischewitz say the company is
oblivious to the surging year-round demand, even from
non-Jews, for new kosher products.
   "It's a no-brainer to double the size of this company, but
nobody has addressed the issue," says shareholder Lawrence
Goldstein, a principal of Santa Monica Partners, a New York
investment firm. "This company needs a fresh management
approach. I would have said the same prior to" the indictment
last month of Manischewitz by a federal grand jury in Newark,
N.J., on charges of conspiring to fix Passover matzo prices.
   Jeffrey Herr, a 20-year veteran of the Manischewitz board,
says: "This is a company that, in my estimation, has missed
many great opportunities." Mr. Herr is senior vice president
of Chicago Corp., an Illinois investment-banking firm.
   Manischewitz -- which declined to comment for this article
-- makes matzo and other kosher foods. For this Passover,
which begins at sundown today, Manischewitz will record an
estimated $7.5 million in sales of matzo alone. The company
commands some 80% of the U.S. matzo market, half sold at this
time of year.
   Observant Jews have eaten the unleavened bread for
Passover, an annual eight-day festival marking the Biblical
exodus from Egypt, for more than 3,000 years. Manischewitz,
which has never strayed far from tradition in 102 years,
expects to rake in money for years to come.
   Yet, while many companies mistakenly venture outside a
lucrative niche, Manischewitz shows how refusing to leave a
niche can also be damaging. "Either you move forward or
backward in business," says shareholder J. Morton Davis,
chairman of D.H. Blair &amp; Co., a New York securities firm.
"You have to exploit opportunity when it's there, and they're
not," he says of Manischewitz.
   Robert M. Starr, 61-year-old president and chief executive
officer of Manischewitz, declined to comment. But last
October, in the wake of an abortive management-led buy-out
bid, he said Manischewitz was no longer for sale, and added:
"The company remains strong. Our position in the marketplace
is solid."
   Manischewitz had sales of $32.5 million for the fiscal
year ended last July 31. But heavy legal expenses and costly
efforts to sell the company slashed net income to $286,861,
or $5.41 a share, from $2.9 million, or $55.08 a share, a
year earlier.
   The more than two-year-old federal antitrust investigation
of Manischewitz, which sells through some 50 distributors,
has taken a toll. Last year, the company endorsed the
management-led buy-out bid, valued at $44.6 million, or $841
share, but the plan crumbled after outsiders in the buy-out
group were unable to get Manischewitz to disclose details of
the investigation. (The shares, thinly traded on the
Cincinnati Stock Exchange, were quoted most recently at $700
bid.) Last year, Manischewitz turned away at least two other
suitors.
   If found guilty of the price-fixing charges, the company
could face millions of dollars in penalties and possibly a
backlash from indignant consumers. Manischewitz, which
earlier defeated one competitor's civil antitrust lawsuit
over the gefilte-fish market, has said its matzo prices are
fair.
   Founded in 1888 by a rabbi, the company has always served
observant Jews; it adheres strictly to kashrut, ancient laws
that govern food preparation. The company has three of the
four major matzo brands in the U.S: Manischewitz, Horowitz
Margareten and Goodman's. (The fourth is Streit's, made by
Aron Streit Inc., New York.) Besides matzo, which accounts
for more than 40% of sales, Manischewitz makes soup, cookies,
cakes and processed fish.
   A big bite of the profit is passed on to four
Manischewitz-family members, with a 36% stake. On top of a
total of nearly $200,000 a year in consulting fees, the four
(three of whom are directors) together receive $750,000 a
year in dividends.
   While stressing dividends, the company has largely ignored
fundamental changes sweeping through its market, investors
and analysts say. No longer dominated by a few firms making
only a few items, the kosher-food industry has moved into new
and expanding markets. Not only are more young Jews keeping
kosher, but the perception among non-Jews that kosher
products are very healthy is rising as well, marketing
consultants say.
   The new kosher foods include such diverse fare as pizza,
tacos, egg rolls and pollack, a fish. Menachem Lubinsky, a
New York marketing consultant, says marketers have launched
an estimated 1,000 new kosher products in the past year
alone. He says kosher-food sales probably exceed $1.5 billion
a year in the U.S. and are growing at least 15% a year. Sales
at Manischewitz grew half that fast during the past four
years.
   Investors say adopting modern marketing techniques would
spur growth. National Foods Inc., New York, which was one of
the bidders for Manischewitz last year, has $150 million in
annual sales-- quadruple Manischewitz's volume -- partly by
promoting its Hebrew National franks on television (which
Manischewitz shuns).
   They also point to Manischewitz's performance in the wine
business. Manischewitz licenses others to use its name on
traditional kosher wine, which is sweet. But consumers have
swung toward dry wine, and the company's once-healthy royalty
stream is now a trickle. In contrast, Royal Wine Co.
introduced kosher dry wines in 1978; now they account for two
of every three bottles that the New York company sells.
Manischewitz's licensee finally rolled out a dry table wine
last year.
   Even in its matzo business, Manischewitz has missed
chances. In an era of soaring health-consciousness, many food
companies might like to proclaim that their principal product
is served for breakfast in the celebrated Pritikin diet
program. Manischewitz's matzo is, but Mr. Goldstein, the
shareholder, says the company's marketers have ignored that
fact.

   World Bank Holds
   Zaire Loan to Push
   For Overhaul Plan

   WASHINGTON -- The World Bank is pressuring Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko to spend more money on programs
for his impoverished people and less on security, political
institutions and presidential perks.
   To that end, the international financial institution is
holding up disbursing about $100 million in non-project loans
to the Central African government, according to persons
familiar with the decision. They said the funds won't be
disbursed until Mr. Mobutu shows a willingness to spend more
on health, education and other public services. Some World
Bank funds earmarked for specific projects will continue to
be disbursed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank's action surfaced as some in Congress
stepped up their attacks on Mr. Mobutu, whose regime often
has been attacked on Capitol Hill for corruption and
human-rights abuses. Mr. Mobutu, a close ally of the U.S., is
thought to be among the world's richest men, with estimates
of his wealth reaching as high as $5 billion. The average
Zairean earns less than $200 a year, according to World Bank
figures.
   Last week, Howard Wolpe (D., Mich.), the chairman of the
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa, and another
prominent House Democrat, Stephen Solarz of New York, called
on lawmakers to cut off all military aid to Zaire and to
further restrict economic assistance. Both testified before a
House appropriations subcommittee that is considering the
Bush administration's request for $56 million in economic and
military aid for Zaire.
   The U.S. gives Zaire only about $4 million a year in
military assistance. But if the Congress cuts off such aid,
some Mobutu congressional critics believe, it would be a
powerful signal that U.S. support for the Zairean strongman
was weakening. Last year, Mr. Mobutu embarked on an expensive
public relations campaign to influence Congress.
   The World Bank, meanwhile, isn't likely to restore
non-project assistance for many months. World Bank figures
show that less than 8% of Zaire's $1.2 billion budget is
spent on health and education, while the bulk of the money
goes for presidential spending, foreign-debt service,
security, defense and political institutions Mr. Mobutu
controls. Last year, Mr. Mobutu's congressional critics cited
U.S. and World Bank reports that the Zairean government
hadn't accounted for $400 million in export earnings.
   In recent months, the World Bank hasn't been able to reach
agreement with the Zairean government on a new spending
program, according to persons familiar with the discussions.
World Bank officials, these persons say, emphasized to Zaire
that much more money needed to be spent on education and
other programs that would promote economic growth in the
country.
   They said that even if the World Bank reaches an agreement
with Zaire, it isn't likely that the $100 million in loans
will be disbursed for at least six months. In the past, the
Mobutu government has reneged on promises after funds were
released, these sources said.

   CHICAGO -- The proposed $4.38 billion buy-out of UAL Corp.
would make the parent of United Airlines the world's largest
experiment in employee ownership. But before lenders agree to
fund the landmark transaction, they might want to take a
close look under the hood of the once-dominant carrier.
   The union proposal, approved Friday by UAL directors, does
have some appealing elements. It requires $2 billion less
debt than last year's failed bid by a group that included
management and the pilots union. There are plenty of assets
to serve as collateral and, notably, United's unions agreed
to substantial wage cuts to make the plan work.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the risks loom large as well. This is a company
consumed -- and exhausted -- by buy-out fever. Over the last
three years, the UAL board has considered a total of five
separate bids for the company. Even if this latest proposal
is completed, it might require an additional six to eight
months of wrangling and further distraction. Moreover, the
unions involved in the latest deal aren't exactly an example
of like-mindedness: They tend to squabble with each other as
much as they squabble with management. Thus, employee morale
has been sinking and, with management absorbed with bids and
counterbids, UAL has simply squandered many business
opportunities.
   United was so preoccupied with a proposed buy-out a few
months ago, for instance, that it had to withdraw from a
competition for what might have been its first route to
Europe -- between Chicago and Glasgow, Scotland. Although
United appeared to have the early edge, it was so busy with
internal battles it ended up unable to prove to the
Transportation Department that it had enough planes for the
new route. American Airlines picked up the business by
default, and acknowledges that it wouldn't have won if United
hadn't been so distracted by buy-out proposals.
   British Airways, which has extensive marketing ties with
United, also has grown fidgety. At a Chicago luncheon last
week, Lord King, British Air's chairman, expressed concern
about the partnership and said he hoped United could soon
return to focusing on the airline business.
   Indeed, while rivals like American have grown rapidly,
United has stagnated. Ever since its pilots union first
broached the idea of a buy-out three years ago, its share of
the domestic airline business has remained stalled at 17%.
United has lost ground to competitors at some of its key
hubs, and now American is even threatening to usurp United's
dominance on its home turf: Chicago's O'Hare Airport. In the
last six months alone, United has trimmed its revenue
projections for future years by as much as $1.5 billion
annually.
   If the employee bid succeeds, it is likely that United
will lose many of its top managers. The unions already have
said they will replace UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, who
fought behind the scenes to sink their plan. If he departs,
many of the executives he recruited will undoubtedly leave,
too. That has led people in the airline industry to wonder
whether the unions will be able to assemble a competent
management team on their own.
   "The costs of this transaction are more than meet the
eye," says Karen Firestone, manager of the Fidelity Air
Transportation Fund, which owns UAL stock. "It's not just the
purchase price; you have to look at what's been happening to
the airline-management distraction, lack of immediate
competitive planning during the past year, and a demoralized
employee base."
   Passengers sometimes felt the brunt of the company's
internal chaos. In the past 12 months, United ranked next to
last in terms of on-time performance. Its worst period was
last summer, when the pilots and flight attendants, working
without a contract, refused to volunteer any overtime. The
result: unprecedented flight delays and cancellations.
   It is possible, of course, that an employee buy-out could
cure many of these ills. Despite some highly publicized
failures of employee-owned firms, such as the 1986 bankruptcy
filing of bearings-maker Hyatt Clark Industries Inc., worker
ownership has proven at least as successful as other forms of
corporate takeovers, according to Joseph R. Blasi, professor
at the Institute of Management and Labor Relations at Rutgers
University. He estimates employees currently are majority
owners of about 1,500 companies in the U.S.
   For their part, United's unions predict the transaction
will end the bickering that has divided the carrier. "We
believe {the acquisition} will stabilize this company,
especially in view of all the turmoil that it's been going
through for all these months," says John Peterpaul, a
national vice president of the International Association of
Machinists, who is representing the United machinists in the
transaction. Mr. Peterpaul forecasts that "a new type of work
ethic" will emerge at the carrier if the plan goes through.
   But the proposal also would take United into uncharted
air. Most employee buyouts have involved one major union plus
salaried employees. In United's case, the owners would be
three big unions -- the pilots, the machinists and the flight
attendants -- each with different interests and different pay
levels for their members.
   With so many competing groups, "You have to be careful you
don't wind up with six different agendas" for the company,
says Ed Sambuchi, chief executive of McLouth Steel, a big
employee-owned company in Trenton, Mich. Every month, McLouth
managers clear a large garage in the plant to brief a group
of 60 to 70 workers on the same information given to the
board of directors two days earlier. But that kind of
communication and togetherness won't be possible at a
far-flung operation like United.
   There is also a good chance the deal will fall through
entirely. Although UAL's board gave the three unions up to
four months to secure financing -- plus another four months
to complete the deal -- some lenders believe the chances of
obtaining the needed backing are only slightly better than
50%, especially now that many lenders are turning up their
noses at highly-leveraged transactions. "I wouldn't want to
be raising $4 billion right now," says one executive at a
major U.S. bank.
   Even though employee ownership yields major tax
advantages, those benefits would be more than offset at UAL
by the additional debt the unions plan to carry. Kevin
Murphy, airline analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., estimates
the buy-out will require $4 billion in bank financing on top
of the $750 million note the unions are giving shareholders.
That will add $500 million in extra annual interest costs.
   To help fund that expense, the unions have pledged $300
million in annual pay cuts that would grow to $500 million in
1994. But those cuts are calculated off a hypothetical wage
base that rises 4% annually; so the cuts are less than they
appear. United's shrinking profit leaves little room for
error. Net income last year totaled $325 million and this
year is expected to decline to $240 million. The buy-out
would increase United's debt sixfold, from $800 million to
more than $5 billion.
   Skepticism over financing the transaction on Friday
contributed to a $2-a-share decline in UAL's stock price.
Shares closed at $163.50 in trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. That was well below the unions' proposed buy-out
price of $201 a share, but the discount also reflects the
length of time investors would have to wait to get their
payout, as well as the fact that only $155 a share of the
purchase price is cash.
   As might be expected, the union plan also calls for an
egalitarian approach to corporate governance. Senior
management would get to name three directors and there would
be one board seat for each of the unions. In addition, the
unions would choose eight outside directors. The pilots would
own 37.9% of the stock, the machinists 35.7% and the flight
attendants 12.2%. The remainder would be held by noncontract
employees.
   One factor the unions may have going for them is the
growing weariness of UAL's board. Six months ago, the
directors toasted what they thought was their last meeting
together: the session at which they approved the $300-a-share
buy-out led by UAL Chairman Wolf. But that deal collapsed,
triggering one of the biggest stock market plunges in
history.
   Since then, sources say, the board has been anxious to
resolve matters. Many of its members, such as John F.
McGillicuddy of Manufacturers Hanover Trust or Frank A. Olson
of Hertz Corp., have little sentimental attachment to the
airline business. In January, they grew so irritated with the
slow progress being made by Mr. Wolf that they ordered him to
step aside as the chief negotiator with the unions. The board
turned the job over to one of its legal advisers, Lewis Kaden
of the New York law firm of Davis Polk and Wardwell.
   Meanwhile, employee morale continued to sink. As details
of the proposed buy-out became public, company newsletters
blasted the union's proposals as unfair to management and
other non-union employees. Mr. Wolf was particularly critical
of the unions on a number of points, saying they had
overvalued their concessions and were asking for unreasonable
job guarantees. Union leaders responded with public salvos of
their own.
   Throughout January and February, the company delayed
releasing confidential financial projections that the union
needed to set the price of its bid. When UAL finally provided
the projections, they were so pessimistic that the union
would have had difficulty convincing lenders to finance the
deal, says one person who saw the data. The unions were
especially angry because the numbers were vastly more
negative than projections management supplied to banks to
support its own bid last September. When the union
complained, First Boston Corp., the board's adviser, agreed
to recalculate the revenue projections; the numbers ended up
higher.
   A UAL spokesman referred questions on the episode to First
Boston, which declined to comment. One person familiar with
the projection process, however, said management ordered up
conservative numbers after being criticized, after its own
buy-out collapsed, for its earlier, overly rosy forecasts.
Moreover, the projections compiled in February were lower
partly because of increased fuel and maintenance costs, he
said.
   As the battle between management and the unions grew more
strained, the unions ultimately linked arms with Coniston
Partners, UAL's largest shareholder, and threatened a proxy
fight to oust the board. In the end, that didn't prove
necessary. But the animosity stirred within the company was
substantial.
   United reservation agent Iris Racataian says employees
have tried hard to keep the corporate turmoil from affecting
their dealings with the public. But she acknowledges the
situation "sure affects your pysche." Ms. Racataian says she
believes uncertainty about the airline's future "has hurt us
in terms of our ability to get and keep the most productive
employees."
   The turmoil is visible from the outside, as well. "There's
been this restiveness over there for a long time," says
Jeffrey Kreindler, a Pan American World Airways vice
president. "It's not as if they've had a long period of
stability."
   Thus, while American continues to amass jets, United has
moved more slowly. American now has 500 aircraft to United's
429, enabling it to expand domestically and make significant
inroads in Europe. Indeed, American used United's own hub at
Chicago to help build its European network.
   When it came time to expand its profitable routes in the
Pacific, United again discovered the price of preoccupation.
For some time, management has been fighting with its pilots
union over buying new planes: The union wants them, partly to
assure that there will be an ever-increasing supply of jobs
for its members. Management, in turn, held out, intent on
using potential purchases of planes as a bargaining chip to
win concessions from the pilots.
   As a result of the internal wrangling, United didn't have
the planes it needed when it came time to expand its Asian
routes. So the airline has been forced to scavenge around,
clipping a plane here and there from its domestic routes. It
has covered its Pacific expansion, but at the cost of
business domestically.

   1 -- Feb. 1987 Richard Ferris, UAL's chairman, says the
company will change its name to Allegis Corp. to promote
itself more effectively as a total travel service company.
                                                                                                       

   2 -- April 1987 The United Airlines pilots' union offers
to buy the carrier from its parent for $4.5 billion. The
Allegis board rejects the offer.
                                                                                                       

   3 -- June 1987 Mr. Ferris resigns as chairman and the
company announces it will sell its Hertz rental car and
Westin and Hilton International hotel subsidiaries.
                                                                                                       

   4 -- Dec. 1987 Stephen Wolf becomes chairman of company,
newly renamed UAL.
                                                                                                       

   5 -- Aug. 1989 Investor Marvin Davis offers $240 a share
or a total of $5.4 billion, for UAL. He later raises his
offer to $275 a share or $6.2 billion.
                                                                                                       

   6 -- Sept. 1989 UAL accepts a $300 a share offer worth
about $6.8 billion made by management, unions and British
Airways.
                                                                                                       

   7 -- Oct. 1989 The management led bid collapses after
banks refuse to finance the deal.

   8 -- March 19, 1990 UAL's unions propose a $3.8 billion
buy-out; Coniston Partners, an investment group holding about
12% of UAL, says that unless the company agrees to a buy-out
it will launch a proxy fight to replace the board.
                                                                                                       

   9 -- March 23 UAL's board says it will negotiate with the
unions and also directs its financial advisors to develop
other plans to sell the company.
                                                                                                       

   10 -- April 6 UAL's board agrees to a revised employee
buy-out worth about $200 a share or a total of $4 billion.
But the unions are contributing no cash to the bid and have
not secured financing. If it is successful, Mr. Wolf will be
replaced as chairman.

   Abbott Laboratories Derides Lawsuit
   By Former Chairman, Seeks Dismissal

   CHICAGO -- Abbott Laboratories asked a court to dismiss
ousted chairman Robert Schoellhorn's lawsuit against the
company, calling it "a cry of wounded vanity" rather than a
legitimate complaint.
   Abbott's motion, filed Friday, capped a week in which the
company stepped up a vituperative counterattack against Mr.
Schoellhorn's charges that he was wrongfully dismissed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earlier in the week, Abbott alleged for the first time
that Mr. Schoellhorn violated his fiduciary obligations and
repeatedly defrauded the company during his lengthy tenure.
In addition, it officially fired Mr. Schoellhorn, after a
court modified the terms of a restraining order. Abbott,
based in North Chicago, is a pharmaceutical and
hospital-products concern.
   The company took pains to disclose last week that Mr.
Schoellhorn, within days of being turned out as chairman, had
exercised 253,022 stock options, garnering what the company
said was a profit of $9.3 million. Still to be determined is
whether Mr. Schoellhorn must forfeit 51,600 shares of
restricted Abbott stock, which is valued at $3.5 million
based on Friday's closing price.
   Abbott's latest filing says the lawsuit demonstrates Mr.
Schoellhorn's "inability to distinguish between his personal
interests and those of the corporation he was ostensibly
pledged to serve." A hearing is set for today; an immediate
ruling is thought unlikely.
   In a remarkable suit filed last month, the 61-year-old Mr.
Schoellhorn claims the company forced him out at a December
board meeting he characterized as an "ambush." His complaint
alleges that a committee of outside board members misled him
through a "campaign of deception" that masked their
intentions to unseat him.
   He asked the court to force Abbott to retain him as
chairman, or, failing that, to pay him undetermined damages
for breach of contract.
   Cook County Circuit Court Judge Anthony Scotillo issued a
temporary restraining order last month, under which Abbott
was allowed to depose Mr. Schoellhorn as chairman but
required to maintain certain aspects of his employment
contract. The company had continued paying him, albeit at
half the $1.6 million rate he received last year.
   Last week, Abbott said in court documents it had
discovered through an investigation, which began a month ago,
that "during much of the past decade Schoellhorn has
repeatedly misappropriated Abbott corporate assets for his
personal use" and committed fraudulent acts.
   The documents contain, among other things, allegations
that Mr. Schoellhorn had on a number of occasions used the
company's corporate aircraft for "purely personal purposes,"
and then ordered subordinates to make "false entries" to
conceal the wrongdoing. It also claims he "submitted false
expense reports" and was reimbursed by the company.
   Mr. Schoellhorn, in a response filed with the court,
denies all the charges, calling them "direct and overt
retaliation" to his suit.
   Abbott said that Mr. Schoellhorn had been "terminated
without cause" Wednesday. The move cuts off his pay, and
deprives him of the office space he had been granted before
the judge relaxed part of the restraining order.
   Although the board determined Mr. Schoellhorn's actions
constitute reason to terminate him "with cause," the court's
order doesn't permit that now. If the company eventually is
permitted to declare him fired with cause, he loses the right
to the restricted shares.
   In a response to Abbott's filing earlier last week, Mr.
Schoellhorn's attorney, John H. Mathias Jr., said that an
Abbott attorney contacted him in late March and "announced
Abbott's intention to charge Mr. Schoellhorn publicly with
fraud, misappropriation and personal improprieties" unless he
dropped his suit and forfeited the restricted stock. "Counsel
for Abbott made other remarks that Mr. Schoellhorn could
avoid the personal humiliation that would follow from these
charges if he capitulated to Abbott's demands," Mr. Mathias
said in the response.
   An Abbott spokesman denied the comments were made.

   Circon Corp., Santa Barbara, Calif., said it refinanced
much of its debt, buying back a $9 million convertible
debenture at a discount and revising bank borrowings.
   The maker of miniature television cameras for medical uses
said it expects to report a $700,000 after-tax gain on the
debenture repurchase. In 1989, the company had net income of
$302,000, or six cents a share, on $49.6 million in sales.

   Circon said it bought the debenture for $7.5 million from
the holder, a unit of British-based BOC Group PLC. The
debenture was convertible into one million common shares, or
about 16% of Circon's stock outstanding.
   BOC Group said more than a year ago that it was interested
in selling the debenture.
   Circon said it arranged a new $6 million, five-year bank
term loan in connection with the purchase, and a $10 million
two-year line of credit, supplanting an earlier $8.25 million
line of credit.
   The refinancing overall has reduced current company debt
by $966,000. However, annual interest costs will increase by
about $40,000 this year due to higher interest rates on the
new bank debt, said R. Bruce Thompson, executive vice
president and chief financial officer.

   PNC, Midlantic Say Larger Provisions
   For Loan Losses to Cut 1st-Period Results

   Two large bank holding companies said their first-quarter
results would be reduced significantly by increased
provisions for loan losses.
   The higher losses reflect continued problems in commercial
real estate, particularly in the Northeast. For PNC Financial
Corp., which increased its loan losses by between $70 million
and $80 million, the higher provisions will lower
first-quarter profit by as much as 40%. In the year-ago
period, Pittsburgh-based PNC earned $123.6 million, or $1.32
a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Midlantic Corp., meanwhile, bolstered its first-quarter
loan-loss provision by an additional $110 million, all but
wiping out its estimated first-quarter earnings. In the
year-earlier first quarter, Midlantic earned $59.5 million,
or $1.53 a share. The Edison, N.J., company didn't specify
what it expects to report for the latest quarter.
   The banks' decisions to increase reserves may presage
similar moves by other lenders. In the wake of huge losses
among banks in New England, Florida and elsewhere, examiners
have said they intend to scrutinize loan portfolios more
carefully. The goal is to make sure that all non-performing
loans are properly classified.
   "The standards have been out there but just not enforced,"
said analyst Lacy Shockley of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. "Sooner or later, {examiners} will get to them, and every
one will have to go through their portfolios and apply these
tougher standards."
   In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, PNC shares fell $3.875 to $34. In over-the-counter
trading, Midlantic was unchanged at $14.125.
   While analysts had anticipated larger provisions at
Midlantic, the PNC moves generally weren't expected from a
bank long regarded as well managed and conservatively run.
Friday's announcement, though, suggested to some analysts
that PNC has been overly aggressive in its lending. Reacting
to that prospect, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said Friday
it had placed PNC's debt rating under review for possible
downgrade.
   "My guess is that, contrary their previous statements,
credit quality is not stable, and it continues to
deteriorate," said James M. Rosenberg, a banking analyst for
Shearson Lehman Hutton who first wrote in August 1988 that
the bank had credit problems. "I think the bloom has been off
the rose for two years now," he said.
   Last year, PNC characterized $386.8 million in loans as
"possible credit problems," including $166.9 million in
real-estate construction loans. In 1988, the entire category
accounted for $83.8 million in loans.
   PNC has now significantly increased its loan-loss
provisions in two consecutive quarters. In the fourth quarter
of fiscal 1989, the bank holding company added $180 million
to its provisions for bad Third World debt and domestic
real-estate loans.
   The bank denies that it's ever disguised credit-quality
problems. PNC said the Office of the Comptroller of Currency,
using tougher reviewing criteria, recently examined its
Cincinnati-based Central Bancorporation unit. The result of
the review was a moderate increase in the unit's
non-performing assets.
   PNC said it took the large loan-loss provision to cover
itself in case future reviews of affiliates, including its
largest, Pittsburgh National Bank, result in similar
increases in non-performing assets.
   Meanwhile, at Midlantic, where higher provisions had been
expected, New Jersey's second-largest banking company has
been one of the state's most active construction lenders. At
the end of 1988, commercial real estate represented 30% of
Midlantic's loan portfolio, the highest of any major New
Jersey bank.
   The bank said it is preparing itself for a further decline
in the real-estate market and an increase in Midlantic's
non-performing loans. The increase in the loan-loss provision
brings the total reserve to $450 million.
   Midlantic said it expects to report for the first-quarter
non-performing loans of $630 million, and $85 million of
real-estate acquired through foreclosures.
   Reflecting the anticipated troubles, Moody's said Friday
that it had downgraded $450 million of long-term debt of
Midlantic. It cited "the ongoing process of deterioration in
the real-estate credit portion of . . . member banks' loan
portfolio."

   A RECORD LOW FOR THATCHER

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is the most unpopular
British leader since the Gallup Organization began polling
more than 50 years ago, according to a new Gallup survey.
   The opposition Labor Party, with a massive 52.5% support,
now holds a record 24.5 point lead over Mrs. Thatcher's
Conservative Party, the survey indicated.
   Battered by economic troubles and a backlash against an
unpopular new local government tax levied on almost all
voters, Mrs. Thatcher's ratings have been declining for
nearly a year. The Gallup poll, published in London's
pro-Conservative Daily Telegraph, showed only 24% of voters
questioned approve of the prime minister's performance.
   Mrs. Thatcher's rating outstrips the Gallup unpopularity
ratings of other British leaders in their darkest times. In
May 1940, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, his policy of
appeasing Hitler a failure and Britain in danger of a Nazi
invasion, recorded 32% support.
                                                                                                       

   EAST EUROPE'S PRICE CONTROLS
                                                                                                       

   The preferable path to economic reform in Eastern European
countries would be through removal of price controls in one
quick stroke, said Gyoergy Szapary, the International
Monetary Fund's chief representative in Hungary. "The
problems associated with the transition are daunting," he
said, adding that "people's expectations for dramatic
improvements in availability of goods have increased
sharply." He warned, however, that immediate removal of all
price controls could trigger dangerous inflation.
                                                                                                       

   A CAPITAL FOR UNITED GERMANY
                                                                                                       

   Most West Germans would like to see Berlin, not Bonn, as
capital of a united Germany, according to a survey conducted
for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. Nearly 52%
of 1,000 West Germans questioned last month favored Berlin as
the capital while 26% preferred Bonn. The survey said the
Bonn supporters were mostly among the young generation while
older people generally favored Berlin, capital of the former
German Reich. About 20% of those questioned were undecided.
                                                                                                       

   EC STUDIES FOOD POISONING
                                                                                                       

   Food poisoning is massively underreported throughout the
European Community, according to a study by EC researchers.
Looking into occurrences of poisoning from salmonella and
botulism, the researchers found that illnesses fre quently
stemmed from dirty kitchens. "Dishcloths are teeming with
salmonella," said Paul Gray, senior EC official in charge of
food policy. "My grandmother used to boil them every day."
                                                                                                       

   CENTRAL AMERICAN PATROL BOATS
                                                                                                       

   The United Nations accepted an Argentine offer to provide
four patrol boats and their crews to help monitor irregular
cross-border movements in Central America. The boats will
serve in the Gulf of Fonseca, between Nicaragua, Honduras and
El Salvador, as part of the U.N. Observer Group in Central
America. The group was set up last November to check on the
cross-border movement of arms and men to irregular forces
operating in the region.
                                                                                                       

   WHAT ROMANIA NEEDS
                                                                                                       

   Romania needs $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year in foreign
aid, investment and export credits to modernize its
infrastructure and rebuild its economy, a top economist said.
Eugen Dijmarescu, the head of a commission formed to set
priorities for foreign aid and investment, said emergency aid
in the form of medical supplies, food, clothing and fodder is
still essential almost four months after the revolution that
toppled dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu. He said Romania hopes to
move swiftly from emergency aid to investment and credits
that would rebuild the economy.
                                                                                                       

   LIFE AND DEATH
                                                                                                       

   Japan is at the top of rankings of life expectancy in 33
developed nations, according to new figures from the Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   The average life expectancy in Japan is 79.1 years, 4.1
years ahead of the U.S. figure of 75.0 years; the lowest of
the 33 was Hungary, where the average citizen lives 69.7
years. Japan was also best among the 33 nations in death
rates from all causes, with 628.8 deaths for each 100,000
people each year. The U.S. ranked near the middle, with 828.4
deaths, and Romania was worst, at 1,242.
   On average in the 33 countries, heart disease accounted
for 30% of deaths, with cancer causing 21% and stroke causing
14%. Fourteen percent of deaths in the 33 countries -- about
1.5 million a year -- are attributed to smoking, the CDC
said.
   Fewer Americans smoke, compared with the other countries;
31% of U.S. males and 26% of American females smoke, compared
with 41% of men and 29% of women in the other countries.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   John McCleery, from Floreat, Western Australia, will

Gallipoli on April 25, 1915 -- his 28th birthday. . . . The
Japanese government pardoned two men convicted of attempted
murder -- the final two of more than 10 million pardons
issued to commemorate Emperor Hirohito's death in January
1989. Most of the pardons were for minor offenses such as
traffic violations.

   Bell Atlantic
   Is Barred From
   U.S. Contracts

   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department suspended Bell
Atlantic Corp. from receiving future business from the
federal government because the telecommunications company
allegedly misled the agency on a telephone bid.
   The Treasury, in a letter dated last Tuesday, informed
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic that it believes a Bell
Atlantic subsidiary, Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co., made
"material misrepresentations" in a bid for a $100 million
contract to modernize the Treasury's telephone system in the
Washington area. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. also is
bidding for the work, in the latest of a series of bitter
contests to update the federal government's phone system
after the breakup of the old Bell system.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Treasury spokesman said the allegations of
misrepresentation had been forwarded to the agency's
inspector general for an investigation. Until the
investigation is completed, Bell Atlantic is barred from
receiving future contracts from any federal agency.
   It's unclear how the ban will affect Bell Atlantic, which
estimates its revenue from the federal government at more
than $250 million annually. Bell Atlantic is set to begin
service this week on a telephone contract, valued at tens of
millions of dollars annually, to hook Washington-area federal
agencies together. The telecommunications company also has
won a big Pentagon telephone contract, but that award is
being appealed.
   Bell Atlantic denounced the Treasury decision as showing
"clear bias" in favor of AT&amp;T. It also accused the agency of
trying to "eliminate C&amp;P {Chesapeake &amp; Potomac} from the
bidding." The Treasury denied any bias; AT&amp;T declined
comment.
   The allegations of misrepresentation focus on whether Bell
Atlantic based its bid on telecommunications equipment that
wasn't "commercially available," as required by the Treasury.
Bell Atlantic said it had successfully challenged two
attempts by the Treasury to award the contract to AT&amp;T by
making the same allegations -- that AT&amp;T hadn't used
commercially available equipment.
   The Treasury telephone contract was supposed to have been
awarded in 1987, but is now three years behind schedule
because of the wrangling between Bell Atlantic and its former
parent, AT&amp;T. The latest Treasury decision will delay the
award at least until the end of the inspector general's
investigation. If history is any guide, the final contract
award will probably be challenged by the loser.

   Mesa Drops Efforts
   To Sell Interests
   In Prime Properties

   DALLAS -- Mesa Limited Partnership said it dropped efforts
to sell interests in some of its prime properties for up to
$400 million, a move that was intended to reduce the
company's heavy debt load.
   The natural-gas producer, led by outspoken investor T.
Boone Pickens Jr., said Friday that it has abandoned a plan
to sell about 16 million units in a new Hugoton Royalty
Trust, made up of some of its top natural gas properties,
because of the market's disappointing reaction to its
offering. Mesa said its underwriters indicated the price
would be lower than the $23 to $26 a unit it had hoped for.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're simply not going to sell a portion of our premier
properties at an inferior price," Mr. Pickens said.
   But scrapping the plan leaves the company with a huge debt
burden, which stood at $1.52 billion on Dec. 31, and annual
interest costs that ran to $183 million last year, or more
than half of Mesa's $356 million in 1989 revenue.
   A Mesa spokesman said that the company is continuing to
explore alternatives to shrink its debt. Meanwhile, he said,
dropping the offering won't leave Mesa in a liquidity bind
because it had about $350 million in cash and marketable
securities at year end and another $150 million in borrowing
capacity.
   But Sal Ilacqua, an analyst at Rothschild Inc., said that
Mesa may have to reconsider whether to continue paying its
preferred distribution of $1.50 a unit for the time being.
The distribution is guaranteed until next year, but Mesa
could delay the payout, he said.
   At the least, Mr. Ilacqua said, Mesa should begin
liquidating its marketable securities portfolio of about $243
million. For several years, Mesa has relied on profits from
stock-market trading to improve its cash flow. But Mr.
Ilacqua noted that "the takeover game has not been that
rewarding" of late and Mesa should use part of its portfolio
to reduce its debt.
   To improve its cash flow, Mesa recently eliminated its
annual common distribution of $1.50 a unit and sold or agreed
to sell about 1.5 million shares of Edisto Resources Corp.,
reducing its stake in that energy company to about 15%.
   Mesa, one of the nation's largest natural gas producers,
has repeatedly bet that natural gas prices would improve and
has watched the gamble fail as prices remained stubbornly
low. In hopes that prices would rise, Mesa previously
borrowed to make its common distribution and, in 1988, paid
$715 million to acquire some properties from Tenneco Inc. A
company spokesman said Mesa believes the market reaction to
its Hugoton offering was lukewarm because natural gas prices
currently are lower than they have been for several years at
this time, and the weakest season for natural gas demand is
just beginning.

   Heinz to Unveil
   Recyclable Bottle
   For Its Ketchup

   PITTSBURGH -- Add ketchup bottles to the growing list of
environmentally friendly containers.
   H.J. Heinz Co., the world's largest ketchup maker, said it
will introduce a recyclable plastic ketchup bottle next year.
Although the package material, called polyethylene
terephthalate, or PET, has been used for soft-drink bottles
since the 1970s, the food company spent three years and $8
million developing the material for its own bottles. It
worked on the project with Continental PET Technologies, a
division of Continental Can Co. that also makes PET
containers for soft drinks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move is the latest response to increased concerns over
environmental problems created by nonrecyclable plastics.
Last month, Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said it
would begin to sell some of its detergents and cleaners in
bottles made from recycled plastic.
   Heinz said the recyclable package will replace its opaque,
squeezable plastic container, which was introduced in 1983
and accounts for 60% of the 190 million ketchup bottles Heinz
sells in the U.S. each year. The rest are glass. The new
recyclable package also is squeezable but is clear like a
glass jar, which the company believes consumers will prefer.
   The new container "meets consumer demands on two levels:
the recycling issue as well as the functionality of the
package," said Brian Ruder, vice president of the
consumer-products division for Heinz U.S.A.
   Heinz said that the change will require some retooling of
its factories but that the new package will not increase
ketchup prices.
   Consumers will be asked to put the recyclable ketchup
container in a bag for curb-side pick-up. But only homes that
are in a region served by special reclamation facilities,
where the containers are recycled into consumer goods, can
participate. There are currently about 30 such facilities,
but Heinz says that number will increase as the special
containers become more widespread.

   Battle Over Alternative Fuels Is Likely
   To Heat Up Debate on the House Floor

   WASHINGTON -- Alternative fuels for automobiles are at the
center of what will probably be the hottest environment vs.
industry battle in the House floor debate on clean-air
legislation.
   The House's chief environmentalist, Rep. Henry Waxman (D.,
Calif.), is promising to try to resurrect President Bush's
proposal last year to require auto makers to produce one
million cars a year by 1997 that run on fuels, such as
methanol, that are cleaner than gasoline. Auto makers and the
oil industry have succeeded in killing the requirement in the
Senate and so far in the House.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Waxman says he also will propose strengthening the
clean-air bill passed late Thursday by the House Energy and
Commerce Committee to expand the use of reformulated gasoline
in smoggy cities and of even cleaner-burning fuels such as
natural gas in centrally fueled fleets.
   Mr. Waxman's proposal sets up a titanic confrontation with
Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the House's chief defender of
the auto industry and the powerful chairman of the commerce
panel. Unless the two can strike a compromise before the
clean-air bill is taken up by the full House late this month
or in early May, "this will be the environmental vote on the
House floor," Mr. Waxman says.
   In fact, the alternative-fuels issue is one of the few big
league disputes left for the House following a series of
unusual bipartisan deals between Mr. Dingell and Mr. Waxman,
who are traditionally enemies in clean-air issues, and other
members of the panel.
   The committee locked up compromises on the major clean-air
provisions for reducing acid rain, smog in cities, tailpipe
exhaust and toxic industrial emissions. And members agreed to
stick to their guns on the issues through the House debate
and through arduous talks ahead with the Senate over
differences in clean-air provisions.
   "Most of the major areas of controversy have been removed
from this bill," Mr. Dingell said. Added Mr. Waxman, "It's
unlikely that any of these compromises are going to be
changed on the House floor." Unlike the Senate, which cut
bargains in closed-door talks with the White House before
floor action, the Bush administration wasn't deeply involved
in House committee negotiations.
   The compromises spare the House from deeply divisive
fights over subsidies for socalled dirty Midwestern utilities
hardest hit by the cost of acid-rain controls and over
reducing cancer deaths from factory fumes even at the expense
of closing plants.
   Mr. Dingell and Republican House members who are concerned
about the economic costs of the legislation, whose price tag
for industry ranges from $19 billion and $21.5 billion
annually by the year 2005, accepted tougher controls on
industry than they might have liked. But in return, they're
spared from even more stringent requirements that many
observers think could have been adopted on the House floor in
today's political climate, which is charged with concern for
the environment.
   Mr. Waxman said that rather than gamble on winning big
environmental votes on the House floor, he decided to settle
for solid solutions that stand a better chance of becoming
law because they will carry the support of key House
Republicans and Mr. Dingell in negotiations with the Senate.
   The compromises achieved by the House also have the
surprising effect of pleasing both industry and
environmentalists to a greater degree than a bill passed last
week by the Senate.
   Neither industry nor environmentalists are entirely happy
with the House bill. But both saw the greatest improvement in
the House panel's provisions for reducing toxic factory
emissions, which are blamed for causing at least 3,000 cancer
deaths a year.
   The House version "removes the automatic shutdown threat
{for coke ovens}, and that's why the steel industry likes
it," said John Stinson, a National Steel Corp. official
lobbying for the industry. Steelmakers claim a majority of
coke ovens would be closed under the Senate's provisions to
reduce cancer risks for people living next to plants.
   David Doniger, an air toxics expert with the Natural
Resources Defense Council, likewise prefers the House version
over the Senate's because the House measure requires cleanups
from smaller sources such as dry cleaners and drops
provisions that he says wouldn't eliminate cancer risks to
plant neighbors.
   The main reason the House bill is acceptable to both
sides, however, is probably that it effectively defers for
seven to 10 years the most contentious issue of how to cut
cancer risks that remain after industries have already
installed the best available technology. That technology
would reduce emissions 75% to 90%.
   Besides alternative fuels, other unresolved issues are
narrower but still contentious. Talks on some of them could
yield compromises before full House action, lawmakers said.
   Rep. Jim Bates (D., Calif.), with the support of
environmentalists, is expected to seek a total phase-out in
the U.S. before the year 2000 of chlorofluorocarbons,
chemicals blamed for destroying the atmosphere's protective
ozone layer. The Senate has already adopted a similar
provision. There also will likely be an attempt to draw
limits on the use of certain substitute chemicals now being
developed by such companies as Du Pont Co.
   Two sideline issues on toxic industrial emissions are
still being debated. Environmentalists and industry will
likely take opposing views on defining the minimum amount of
controls that existing factories should be forced to install.
Environmentalists, concerned about accidents like the deadly
release several years ago in Bhopal, India, are also seeking
provisions to prevent and investigate chemical accidents in
the U.S.
   Also in the works are amendments to remedy pollution
problems in national parks, to fix both small businesses' and
environmentalists' problems with a proposed national program
for issuing operating permits to all polluters, and possibly
to lengthen warranty requirements now in the House bill
covering automobile air pollution equipment.

   Spanish Brewer Cruz del Campo Expected
   To Fetch $1 Billion in International Sale

   Beer isn't a product usually associated with the Spanish,
but Spain's largest brewer, Cruz del Campo S.A., is expected
to be auctioned to a foreign buyer soon for around $1
billion.
   Investment analysts in Spain say they believe the asking
price for Cruz, which has been on the block for several
months, is between 120 billion pesetas ($1.1 billion) and 130
billion pesetas ($1.2 billion).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Goldman Sachs International Ltd., a London unit of
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., says the auction has attracted global
interest but declines to give a price range. Cruz's owners
aim to complete the transaction by the end of June, an
executive familiar with the situation says.
   The auction is a matter of some urgency for at least one
of Cruz's owners, Stroh Brewery Co., Detroit, which holds
about 29% of the Spanish brewer's shares. The sale would
provide a badly needed infusion of cash for Stroh, whose
agreement to sell most of its American beer operations to
Adolph Coors Co. fell through in December.
   Cashing in on what used to be regarded as a backwater of
Stroh's empire would provide "rain on parched earth" as the
American brewer struggles to put its finances in order, says
Tom Pirko, a beverage consultant at Bevmark Inc., Los
Angeles. Combined with a sale of some U.S. assets, the
Spanish proceeds might allow Stroh to limp on as an
independent brewer, Mr. Pirko says.
   For potential buyers, Cruz offers a well-established
distribution network in one of the few major countries where
beer sales are still growing.
   As it has grown more popular among Spanish youth, beer has
taken market share away from the country's traditional
tipple, wine (just as wine sales are growing at the expense
of beer in Northern Europe). Industry executives say the beer
market has grown about 4% annually by volume over the past
decade. In money terms, sales more than doubled to 258
billion pesetas last year from 105 billion pesetas five years
before.
   Brewers see plenty of scope for further froth. Though
per-capita beer consumption already has risen to about 71
liters from 45 liters in 1974, it remains far below West
Germany's 146 liters. Even if Spaniards never take to
swilling beer in Germanic volumes, the Spanish industry
figures it can narrow the gap considerably.
   The industry also can count on heavy sales to the 50
million or so tourists who flood into Spain each summer. Many
tourists prefer imported beers, however, and that makes Spain
all the more attractive to foreign brewers looking for new
outlets.
   Goldman Sachs has asked the potential buyers poring over
Cruz's books not to talk about the sale, but at least two
brewers -- Interbrew S.A. of Belgium and Heineken N.V. of the
Netherlands -- have confirmed they are having a look. One
executive involved in the sale says that at least several
more companies are also pursuing the matter.
   Some analysts say BSN S.A. of France, which owns the
French brewer Kronenbourg, is among the potential buyers, but
BSN declines to comment. Kronenbourg already owns a major
stake in Mahou S.A., a Madrid brewer.
   Carlsberg AS of Denmark, which has a majority stake in
another Spanish brewer, Union Cervecera S.A., also declines
to say whether it is bidding for Cruz.
   So far, foreign brewers haven't found Spain an easy
market. Svend Pedersen, an executive vice president at
Carlsberg, acknowledges that Union Cervecera has been
unprofitable, but says the Danish company is confident about
turning it around. A Heineken spokesman says profit at its
51%-owned Aguila S.A. unit was "under pressure" last year as
the Madrid brewer shouldered the costs of closing some
breweries and upgrading others.
   Because Cruz's shares aren't publicly traded, analysts
know little about the company's finances, but they say Cruz
is profitable and appears to have good growth prospects.
Including stakes in other brewers, Cruz has a market share
estimated at 22%, with annual production of about 5.9 million
hectoliters.
   Banco Hispano, one of Spain's largest banks, owns about 8%
of Cruz and says it might hang on to the stake when the
others sell, though a financial source said he expects
Hispano to sell if the price is right. Other shareholders
include the Andalusian families of Ibarra, Osborne, Laffite
and Delgado.
   Before putting itself on the block internationally, Cruz
approached several Spanish beer and food companies to see
whether a deal could be struck at home. Sources close to
Torras S.A., the holding company for the Kuwait Investment
Office's interests in Spain, say that company declined to buy
Cruz because the price was far too high and the brewer didn't
fit into Torras's strategy.
   Once a buyer is found, a further realignment probably lies
ahead for the Spanish beer industry, says Jose Angel
Gonzalez, chief analyst at the Madrid stockbrokerage
Iberagentes SV. He predicts a period of consolidation in
which the six big brewers will be whittled down to three.
   "The battle for market share that is taking place in other
parts of Europe is about to hit Spain," Mr. Gonzalez says.

   Mutual Funds:
   Bond Funds Had Risks but No Reward in First Quarter

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Risk is supposed to get rewarded, but lately
that hasn't been the case for investors in bond mutual funds.
   Among fixed-income funds, the first-quarter leaders were
the drab but safe money market funds. They posted a quarterly
gain of nearly 2%, not huge, but better than any other
category ranked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The first quarter was the worst period for bond funds
since mid-1987. As interest rates spiked upward in the
quarter, with the yield on benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds
jumping 0.66 percentage point to 8.63%, people who took the
risk of buying longer-maturity bonds got clobbered.
   And so the money market funds lead the fixed-income pack,
and beat most categories of stock funds in the quarter,
according to Lipper's quarterly rankings. The exception:
funds specializing in science and technology stocks, which
posted a first-quarter gain of 2.7%.
   Money market funds -- which generally hold the very
short-term corporate IOUs known as commercial paper and
Treasury bills with less than three months to maturity -- did
better than funds holding bonds with maturities of one to
five years. And those shorter-term bond funds, in turn, did
better than funds with longer-maturity bonds.
   Investors weren't rewarded for taking credit risks,
either. Corporate bond funds holding the lower-rated but
still investment grade BBB bonds lagged behind those with
A-rated paper.
   Hardest hit of all were those funds holding bonds rated
below investment grade, the junk bond funds. These
high-yielding bond funds were trounced for a 4% loss in the
quarter, worse even than the average stock fund. That 4% loss
-- which reflects both price changes and dividends paid to
fund shareholders -- brings the total 12month loss for junk
funds to 6.6%.
   But for most bond fund investors, the worst may be over.
"There may have been a turnaround in March," says A. Michael
Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. "In almost all cases,
the bond funds were up in March on a total-return basis. Is
that the beginning of a trend? I don't know."
   Convertible bond funds led the March rebound with a rise
of 1.5%, and junk funds were the second best performing group
with a gain of 1.1%.
   "{The junk bond market} is in its bottoming phase," says
Barbara Kenworthy, a portfolio manager with Dreyfus Corp. "I
don't think all the bad news is out. Clearly, we're still
seeing companies having problems with profitability. We're
also continuing to see a problem with liquidity in the
market. I don't think the market could take any sort of
selling pressure."
   Nevertheless, after eight consecutive months of
hemorrhaging by junk funds, investors now seem to be putting
more money into junk funds than they are pulling out.
   Municipal bond funds were popular with investors
throughout the first quarter. "This may be a seasonal factor,
as people realize the amount of tax they have to pay," says
Mr. Lipper.
   Demand from small investors, plus a relative dearth of new
issues, helped buoy the municipal bond market. Municipal bond
funds generally posted gains for the quarter, with tax-exempt
money market funds leading the way.
   In the taxable fund market, Ms. Kenworthy says the spread
between inflation and the yield on longer-term bonds now is
quite attractive. "With inflation at 4 1/2%, you have a
bargain in the bond market," she reckons. "I think the market
is too bearish on what's going to happen on the inflation
front."
   While money market funds fared well in the quarter, they
don't look nearly so hot if you look at the past 12 months.
In that period, the biggest gains were notched by Ginnie Mae
funds and Treasury bond funds. The Ginnie Mae funds invest in
securities of the Government National Mortgage Association
that are backed by federally guaranteed mortgages.

   Environment:
   Public Outcries
   Move Airports
   To Cut Noise

   Airport noise is under increasing fire around the U.S.,
but angry critics won't quiet down until even more is done.
   "It's sort of like smoking," says Dale McDaniel, deputy
associate administrator for policy at the Federal Aviation
Administration. "People's tolerance keeps going down."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So airports are imposing a raft of new operating rules
that airlines worry will disrupt schedules and service -- and
simply divert the noisier planes to other airports. Some of
the suggested solutions may mean big problems for airlines
with large numbers of older, noisier jets, but carriers with
lots of newer, quieter planes may be better off.
   The airports, especially those that have had recent
air-traffic surges, are staving off citizens' revolts with
noise "budgets," nighttime curfews and fines -- much to the
dismay of airline officials.
   Complying with rules causes headaches for airline
schedulers, who must match aircraft to particular airports'
restrictions. Airlines often send a single aircraft on a
national itinerary. "One restriction can affect the schedules
for 20 flights," says Mr. McDaniel. But local officials
hailed the new noise rules as innovative.
   Just last week, the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport
approved a plan to sharply cut noise by the year 2001. The
decision followed a voluntary mediation process attended by
pilots, airlines, community groups, the FAA and the Port of
Seattle. The plan calls for creating a steadily shrinking
noise "budget" that would cap the noise, allocate it among
various carriers and reduce it over time. The goal is to
compel carriers to switch to the quieter planes known as
Stage 3 aircraft for most of their flights by 2001.
   Other airports also are moving to scale down noise. In
North Carolina, Raleigh-Durham International Airport, which
saw its traffic soar when American Airlines established a hub
there in 1987, now wants to bring its noise down to the
pre-1987 level. It is also considering a noise "budget" that
would force the use of quieter planes. A Boeing 727, for
example, is an older Stage 2 plane while a Boeing 757 is a
Stage 3 aircraft.
   Several airports, including Boston Logan International
Airport and San Francisco International Airport, have already
imposed tough anti-noise requirements. In California, Orange
County's John Wayne International Airport may have the most
stringent standards in the country. The practical impact of
its rules is that only Stage 3 aircraft can fly there. The
airport goes even further, limiting the number of flights of
even the noisier kinds of Stage 3 planes.
   The noise hubbub is occurring despite statistics
suggesting the problem should be quieting down. The number of
people subjected to what the FAA defines as "unacceptable"
noise levels has decreased to 3.2 million from seven million
in the early 1970s, and is expected to decline to one million
by 2010. That reflects the industry's gradual shift to
quieter aircraft.
   But anti-noise activists scoff at the numbers, saying they
are imprecise. "People don't go to the FAA to find out
whether they have a noise problem," says Tom Duffy, executive
director of the National Organization to Insure a
Sound-Controlled Environment (N.O.I.S.E.). "They say, `I
don't like these planes this loud near my house.' There are
lots more planes than there used to be, and that's why people
are sensitive."
   That sensitivity carries big cost implications for
airlines. Today, about 55% of the planes used in
commercial-airline service in the U.S. are the older, noisier
planes categorized as Stage 2. The rest are the newer,
quieter Stage 3 planes.
   Some groups, including airport operators -- who are
legally liable for damages caused by noise -- are pushing for
a government-ordered early phase-out of Stage 2 planes by the
year 2000. Replacing Stage 2 planes with Stage 3 aircraft
will cost U.S. carriers as much as $90 billion, industry
analysts say. Setting the year 2000 as a deadline would add
as much as $2.5 billion to the cost, according to the FAA.
   Such an early-retirement rule would be tough on the
financially weaker carriers, such as Eastern Air Lines, Pan
American World Airways and Trans World Airlines, which have
lots of noisy planes and not much financial wherewithal to
replace them. Cargo carriers, which have largely Stage 2
fleets, could be hurt, too.
   Because of the cost involved, airlines want something in
return for an accelerated phase-out of older planes: a
national moratorium on new airport-noise restrictions -- in
effect a federal pre-emption of the airports' authority to
set new rules. "The airline industry doesn't object to a
phase-out of Stage 2 if it's reasonable and achievable," says
Robert Aaronson, president of the Air Transport Association,
the airlines' trade association. "But there has to be
protection of the Stage 3 fleet."
   Critics say setting a national noise standard would be a
big mistake. "The notion that you have to come up with a
national noise policy to address situations at San Diego,
Washington Dulles or Denver is ludicrous," says Eliot Cutler,
a Washington-based attorney who represents a number of
communities on noise issues.
   Uncle Sam, for his part, is sending out mixed signals on
the issue. The Bush administration's national transportation
policy, released in February, included only sketchy language
on airport noise. Recently, though, James Busey, the FAA
administrator, warned the sprouting of noise rules could hurt
interstate commerce.
   Such rules sometimes pit airport against airport. Some
residents around National Airport, adjacent to downtown
Washington, want the airport's nighttime noise curfew
tightened. But some Loudoun County, Va., residents object,
saying the noisier planes would wind up at Washington Dulles
International Airport, 34 miles west of National. "We'd get
the leftovers," complains Ann Kavanagh, a member of the
Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, whose district includes
Dulles.
   In other cities, plans to build new airports or expand old
ones are under attack because of noise concerns.
   In Texas, a range war is erupting over plans to add two
runways to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, which in
coming years is projected to become the busiest airport in
the country. "We feel that our lives and our privacy are
being invaded," complains Shirley Page, a retired teacher who
lives in the city of Grapevine, which is next to the airport.
   Residents of Tempe, Ariz., are fighting plans to add a
reliever runway to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.
And some Bridgeton, Mo., residents are so mad about the
proposed expansion of city-owned Lambert-St.Louis
International Airport that they have founded a group called
Bridgeton Air Defense (BAD) that provides a telephone
joke-of-the-day about St. Louis Mayor Vincent Schoemehl. But
officials at all three airports say their expansions are
crucial to handle expected airtraffic surges in coming years.
   Finding an accommodation between the need for additional
airport room and local homeowners' yearnings for peace and
quiet is vital, experts say. "If we don't get a handle on
noise," warns Allen Li of Congress's General Accounting
Office, "we'll never be able to keep pace with growth in the

   Austria's Chancellor and the East-West Nexus

   VIENNA -- To return to this city after 20 years is to
discover revitalization. On a sunny spring day, sidewalk
cafes are in full bloom on the stylish pedestrian malls that
wend through rococo grandeur. Newly scrubbed buildings
contrast sharply with the lingering postwar drabness of 1969.
It is no longer hard to imagine what Vienna's "fin de siecle"
heyday must have been like, and to wonder whether it is on
the verge of something like that again.
   Some have argued that the Hapsburg empire fell precisely
because it was too liberal, too relaxed, too frivolous, too
cosmopolitan and too multinational to cope with the 20th
century's explosion of militaristic nationalism. Could be.
Partly because it had all those qualities, gay Vienna at the
turn of the century was a haven for individuals who would be
leading protagonists in the century's great, bloody
historical dramas. Austrian politician-banker Hannes Androsch
listed them in a 1987 anthology called "Austria Past and
Present" (Christian Brandstatter Verlag &amp; Edition):
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "While Leo Bronstein, later known as Trotsky, was playing
chess at the Cafe Central, another exile from Russia, Joseph
Dzhugashvili, called Stalin by his fellow revolutionaries,
lived in a modest flat in Schonbrunnerstrasse busy working on
a paper examining the nationality question of the monarchy, a
work commissioned by his mentor, Vladimir Ulyanow, or Lenin.
At the same time one Josip Broz, who had still a long way to
go before achieving fame as Tito, worked as a toolmaker at a
factory in Wiener Neustadt, while in a night shelter in
Meldemann Strasse in Vienna's 20th district, a part-time
post-card painter named Adolf Hitler delivered political
speeches against Zionism, a movement initiated in Vienna a
few years earlier by the staff writer of the daily `Neue
Freie Presse,' Theodor Herzl, under the influence of the
Dreyfus affair.
   "At the same time there sat in the Reichsrat, the
monarchy's legislative body, the Czech, Thomas Masaryk, later
to become his country's first president, and the Italian,
Alcide de Gasperi, who after World War II was to rise to be
one of Europe's dominating political figures.
   "Confronted with this bundle of fateful parallelisms, one
is somewhat hard put to discard it all as mere coincidence.
Meanwhile, keeping aloof from politics as well as from
`official' medical science, Sigmund Freud, in his doctor's
office in 19 Bergasse put his patients on the couch and
psychoanalysis on the map, thereby laying bare the secret
dimension of a society dancing on the top of the volcano."
   It is hard to imagine such an incredible cast of fame's
fledglings assembled in today's Vienna, or any other city.
But it is not so hard to conjure a new role for Vienna itself
in Europe. The empire built by the Vienna post-card painter
collapsed long ago and now the one assembled by the scribbler
of Schonbrunnerstrasse may be crumbling as well. If Europe is
to become a kinder and gentler place in the 1990s -- and that
still is more a hope than a certainty -- quite possibly
Vienna can help make it happen.
   Mr. Androsch writes that "at the bottom of their hearts
the Austrians have not yet come to terms with the downfall of
their empire." But no one seriously talks of trying to
reassemble Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia into a new
mini-Austro-Hungarian empire. For one thing, Austria's
ambitions mainly turn it westward. It very much wants to
become a part of the European Community and share in the
benefits of the EC's reduced barriers to trade and capital
flows. It can't imagine why its 1955 declaration of
neutrality, which helped it escape the Soviet grip, should
remain a barrier in a Europe that is becoming less polarized
politically.
   But Austria is not neglectful of its former empire
partners as they emerge from their long night of communism.
Interestingly enough, the thing it has to offer that might be
most valuable to them is its pragmatism, something for which
Austrians have been criticized more often than they have been
praised. Austrians like to point out that they did not go
socialist for ideological reasons, but simply because state
ownership seemed the quickest way to rebuild the country's
war-shattered industry in the postwar era.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, a tall onetime basketball
star, makes this point during an interview in the parliament
building office he uses part of the time when Parliament is
in session. He is proud of Austria's success in weaning state
industries of subsidies, selling off interests in them to the
private sector, and at the same time allowing a vigorous
private sector to develop. The results show it. Austria's
economy is one of the world's best performers, with real
growth last year of 4%, inflation of 2.6% and unemployment of
3.4%.
   Mr. Vranitzky doesn't expect miracles in the East, but
Austria is doing what it can to help. "We can't supply them
with billions of dollars or deutsche marks, but the size of
our own industry fits very well with the structures of East
Europeans.
   "We try to expand cooperation with them beyond business,
money and economics. We cooperate in party politics. That
means we exchange experts and assist them in how to run a
party, how to run a campaign, how to raise funds, how to
educate the younger people in the party." Austria has been
governed by a grand coalition for the past four years. Its
parties have counterparts in Hungary, which is just emerging
from a second round of elections, and the Austrian coalition
might well serve as a model for Hungary's new government.
   "The first and foremost step they must take is to find
political bearings," says Chancellor Vranitzky. "After that
we will see what kind of government they have and the work --
the very painful and very burdensome work -- to remodel and
restructure and redo their systems will be brought forward.
My perspective is that this will take quite some time. This
will not go smoothly and quickly."
   Austria may be able to help with this process by sharing
some of its own experiences. Modernizing Hungarian industry
will mean laying off workers. But Austria has done just that
and has come out of it with a vote of confidence from labor,
which welcomed the security greater efficiency provides.
   But Austria was in darkness only seven years. It was able
to return to former owners much of the private property the
Nazis and Russians had seized. Agriculture snapped back
quickly. But privatizing after 40 years is complex.
   "Some think one or the other country could become a member
of the EC, or EFTA, {European Free Trade Association} very
soon, but I do not think this is possible within the
foreseeable future," says the chancellor.
   There can be surprises, however. Other great cities, such
as Prague and Budapest, could snap back faster than expected
now that freedom is returning. The villains that "fin de
siecle" Vienna hatched failed to kill it. That is cause for
much hope.

   Jobless Data Point to Weak Economy

   Unemployment Rate Fell
   To 5.2% in March; Gain
   In Payrolls Was Meager

   WASHINGTON -- The latest employment statistics cast some
doubt on the growing sentiment that the economy's weakest
point is past.
   Although the Labor Department's monthly survey of
households found that the nation's civilian unemployment rate
declined slightly in March, the department's closely watched
survey of businesses found that employers' payrolls grew by
only 26,000 during the month, a tiny gain by economists'
standards. The unemployment rate dropped to 5.2% of the
civilian work force, from 5.3% in February.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The meager job growth -- which came despite the hiring of
some 85,000 Census workers during the month -- disappointed
many economists. "This shows widespread weakness," said Gary
Ciminero, chief economist at Fleet/Norstar Financial Services
Group in Providence, R.I. "I'm at a loss to explain the March
weakness without making reference to the fact that the
economy may be a little weaker than the consensus thinks."
   But concern over the numbers was tempered by strong
employment gains in the first two months of the year, when
unseasonably warm weather brought on a spurt of hiring in the
construction business, for example. In both January and
February, employers hired more than 300,000 new workers.
   Paul Anton, president of Anton Financial Economics, a
consulting company in Minneapolis, said the figures don't
cause great concern "because we had such strong numbers in
the past two months. But I certainly would be concerned if we
had another month at this level."
   One of the most disturbing figures in the report was a
30,000 drop in manufacturing jobs. Over the past year, the
report said, the U.S. has lost 250,000 manufacturing jobs.
   Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said the decline in manufacturing
employment wasn't confined to certain industries. "It's all
over," he said. "It's widespread weakness. That's what's
surprising." He cited recent reports from the Federal Reserve
and the National Association of Purchasing Managers that
"seemed to suggest manufacturing was stabilizing."
   After severely slowing in the fourth quarter, the economy
has seemed to rebound a bit in the first quarter of 1990,
buoyed partly by warm weather.
   But Kathleen Cooper, chief economist at Security Pacific
National Bank in Los Angeles, said, "I still believe, based
on these and the last couple of months' numbers on employment
that we will be settling down in the second quarter to much
lower employment growth and lower economic growth."
   Another industry that appears to be weakening is retail
trade, analysts said. Retail employment declined in March for
the second month in a row following a large increase in
January. "These up and down movements make it somewhat
difficult to detect underlying trends, but net job growth for
this industry in recent months is clearly much slower than in
1989," said Janet Norwood, the Labor Department's
commissioner of labor statistics, in congressional testimony
Friday.
   The service industries continued to offset weakness in
other areas of the economy as they have for several months.
Overall, service-producing jobs grew by 122,000 in March, the
department said.
                                                                                                       

   Here are excerpts from the Labor Department's employment
report. The figures are seasonally adjusted.

   Nelson Mandela Is Walking a Thin Line
   Between Pretoria and Black Community

   SEBOKENG, South Africa -- Not even Nelson Mandela can be
in two places at the same time.
   As a black South African, Mr. Mandela wanted to be here
yesterday, one of 20,000 burying the latest group of black
martyrs killed by the South African police. But as the deputy
president of the African National Congress, he found himself
on a plane heading to Lusaka, Zambia, to brief the
organization's exile leadership on his recent talks with the
South African government. His body was there, but his heart
was here. After 27 years in prison, he wants to follow his
people, to be part of them. But he knows he must also lead.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Such is the dilemma of Mr. Mandela as he walks the thin
line between talks with the government and solidarity with
his people. While trying to unify the country's black
majority, which has been systematically divided by the white
government over the decades, Mr. Mandela is battling to catch
up and move forward at the same time. Wherever he goes in the
country, he finds himself having to balance black emotions
over the past with black aspirations for the future.
   Sebokeng, a vast gathering of shacks south of Johannesburg
that has often been a flashpoint of conflict and a target of
repression, provided his first true test, when, on March 26,
police opened fire on residents marching to protest high
rents and poor living conditions. Several blacks were killed
immediately (the death toll is now 17, according to community
leaders) and hundreds were injured. The ANC leadership
expressed outrage at the shootings, but initially said the
tragedy shouldn't derail the opening of ANC-government talks
set for April 11. But when Mr. Mandela and other leaders
visited the injured and the families of the dead, there was
no mistaking the community's anger at the police and
government. Mr. Mandela and the ANC announced a suspension of
the talks.
   Although the decision seemed to highlight divisions within
the ANC -- between Mr. Mandela and others anxious to begin
power-sharing talks with the government and hard-liners
opposed to negotiations -- and subjected the ANC to much
international criticism, Mr. Mandela and his colleagues
really had no choice.
   "For the ANC leaders to go on talking with the government
while ANC members are being killed by the police would have
given a very negative impression to our people," says Michael
Mile, a young ANC supporter who has come to mourn his fallen
friends. "To talk while the killing goes on would have shown
no unity at all."
   While the suspension of talks may have left the ANC
looking in disarray, the Sebokeng shootings actually served
to crystallize both the organization's strategy and Mr.
Mandela's stature in the black community. The ANC is now
telling other black groups and leaders inside the country
that the time has come to choose between it and the
government, between those who were shot and those who did the
shooting.
   "There is no longer room for anyone to be neutral," ANC
leader Walter Sisulu said at yesterday's funeral. "Either you
are with the regime or you are with us."
   After pulling out of this week's scheduled talks with
Pretoria, Mr. Mandela began working to isolate the
government. He spoke with the leaders of six black homelands
who were to meet with the government last week, and four of
them agreed to back out of their talks. Also, the ANC has
persuaded a host of black town councilors around the country
to resign, or pledge to work for the end of the municipal
government structures. The government, which accuses the ANC
of intimidation tactics, had been fervently hoping that the
homeland leaders and black councilors -- its allies in
administering the country's segregated political structure --
would be on its side in future power-sharing negotiations.
   Following these moves, Mr. Mandela met with President F.W.
de Klerk for three hours late last week and agreed to
reschedule the ANC-government talks for May 2-4. He also
pressed Mr. de Klerk into opening a judicial inquiry into why
the police opened fire in Sebokeng.
   "We see that Mandela did raise the grievances of the
people," says Benjamin Hlanyane, one of yesterday's mourners.
"The people now understand that the ANC does represent them."
   Still, the ANC has its opponents. Its bitter differences
with Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who heads the KwaZulu
homeland, have widened in recent weeks as the fighting
between his supporters and ANC sympathizers in Natal Province
intensifies. And the Pan African Congress, which advocates a
black takeover of power and is opposed to negotiations with
the government, accuses the ANC of selling out blacks. On
Saturday, Mr. Mandela met with supporters of the PAC, and the
two groups issued a joint statement saying, "Unity in action
and peace among our people require urgent resolution."
   But in burying its dead yesterday, the ANC resurrected its
dream of black unity. "There are only two roads to take, the
government or the people," shouted Mr. Sisulu. "It is time to
stand united . . . to follow the road traveled by the people
we bury today."

   Bush Is Mulling Ban
   On Some Oil Drilling

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush said he plans to prevent oil
drilling in "certain highly sensitive areas," but aides say a
formal decision still is weeks off.
   Mr. Bush, who made his comment in response to questions at
a convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors,
has been debating for months whether to allow drilling in
three environmentally sensitive tracts off the coasts of
Florida and California. A task force Mr. Bush formed to study
the question sent him a series of options early this year,
but Mr. Bush hasn't announced a decision.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In response to a question about whether he would consider
banning all offshore drilling, Mr. Bush said he wouldn't
approve of any general ban, but then added: "We will be
announcing a policy that prohibits drilling in certain highly
sensitive areas." He didn't refer specifically to the
controversial Florida and California tracts under
consideration, but seemed to be referring to them.
   Administration aides said a final decision about the
tracts appears to be several weeks off. Mr. Bush has asked
for additional information about the offshore areas and
possible options before making his decision, but he hasn't
received that information yet, officials said.
   Mr. Bush's task force recommended a series of options,
which aides said would have the effect of delaying a federal
sale of drilling rights on the tracts for periods ranging
from two to 10 years. But officials said the administration
also is considering the possibility of subdividing the
sensitive tracts so that drilling could be blocked in the
most environmentally fragile areas while it proceeds in other
areas.

About "building a rule-of-law country." Then you say, "No
system of power can replace morality, which is necessary in
any given society." You say: "In the past, the inner
development of the individual in this country was denigrated
as idealism, but now we have to pay a dear price for this. We
need a different conscientious attitude to work, science,
education and the arts, to culture in the broadest sense of
the word." You say: "We need to create conditions for all
spiritual values to be appreciated in society as a vital
condition for full-bloodied life and progress."
   Mikhail Sergeyevich, I love to hear you say such things.
You're right on the mark. These are good words. And here's
what you say on the subject of governance:
   "I proceed from the premise that the adoption of measures
to strengthen the sovereignty of the Union republics and
their economic and political independence and to enhance the
status of autonomous republics and other national territorial
entities should become a special concern of the presidency. .
. . To confirm the republics' sovereignty and their right to
self-determination, including secession, as specified in the
Constitution, the Supreme Soviet should consider and define a
lawful mechanism for secession from the Union as soon as
possible."
   Well, those again are significant statements. You seem to
envisage a looser federation combined with the idea of
self-determination. I might note that if you manage to put
your country on a system where markets, not political central
governments, make the decisions, then some of the strains
that go with the ethnic differences will be moderated. Also,
remember, borders are not what they used to be. If you will
let them be open, let people cross them easily, then you can
moderate some of the strains.
   In your speech, you go to the heart of the problem of
governance in this day and age. Today, all sizable countries
-- and lots of smaller ones -- face diversity: ethnic
diversity, intense national aspirations, cultural diversity,
religious diversity. That's characteristic of our world. It
can't be stamped out. It won't be stamped out. And we
shouldn't want to stamp it out.
   So those who govern have to welcome the diversity and
learn how to manage it. Some countries have had reasonable
success in doing this. The U.S. has. Canada has. In a very
different way, Switzerland has. A lot of countries, however,
have come a cropper. Look at the problems of even a small
country such as Fiji, with its Fijian-Indian problem, or Sri
Lanka with the tensions generated by the Tamil minority. We
see the problem the world over.
   Which brings me, Mikhail Sergeyvich, to Lithuania. Let's
look at the facts. First of all, the Lithuanians want their
independence. Nobody has any doubt about that. I hear some of
your spokesmen question it because the Lithuanians haven't
had a plebiscite. But they have had the closest thing to a
plebiscite that you can get. I saw a statement of yours that
acknowledged that fact, although you said that you doubted
their wisdom in wanting independence. Still they want it.
   I thought you very astutely laid the predicate for
accepting Lithuanian independence when you unearthed the
infamous von Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact and denounced it along
with the Hitler-Stalin deal. Then your Supreme Soviet voted
that the annexation of Lithuania and the other Baltic
countries was illegal. Knowing you are a lawyer, I thought
you were laying the groundwork for their realization of that
independence and also for differentiating the Baltic states
from the other republics in the U.S.S.R.
   As you know, I'm not in a position to speak for the U.S.
anymore. But let me tell you what I would say if I were:
   As far as the U.S. is concerned, it's not a question of
secession. We never recognized the annexation of the Baltic
states by the Soviet Union in the first place. So we stand
with the Lithuanians. They want independence. They are
independent. I have walked by their flag hanging in the lobby
of the State Department many times. We recognized Lithuania
and we have done so continuously since 1940. I thought that
just perhaps when you declared that annexation to be illegal,
as your Supreme Soviet did only a few months ago, you were
coming around to the same point of view.
   But your use of the Soviet army in Lithuania and the
recent passage of a Soviet law setting up a five-year process
governing secession cut against the logic of your own
position. And it means negotiation under duress. This
combination of Soviet military power and after-the-fact
legislation can in the long run only produce an agreement
that will be regarded -- by the Lithuanian people and the
world -- as unequal and illegitimate.
   Therefore, Mikhail Sergeyevich, reverse the order of these
proceedings: Take the Soviet army out of its threatening
positions in Lithuania, announce your acceptance of
Lithuanian independence and then -- under really equal terms
-- negotiate the details of the separation.
   Finally, Mr. President, let me remind you that this is the
information age. Let me quote Lech Walesa from a statement he
made last fall when conditions in Poland were still dicey. He
said:
   "Technology enforces certain solutions. Satellite dishes,
computers, videos, international telephone lines force
pluralism and freedom onto a society. Today Stalin is
impossible. Now you say, what about China? The future
monuments in China will be to those who have been shot. China
will come back to pluralism, democracy and freedom. They
won't be able to destroy all our television sets. People
can't do without telephones. Of course, technological history
can't be turned back. That's why I'm so certain about
victory."
   Mr. President, we live in a world where people know what's
going on. There's a kind an inherent transparency that we
should continue to build up. It is in your interest to do so.
   Mikhail Sergeyevich, you are a great leader, and you have
established a place that is unique in many respects. A new
world order is forming -- not just a new European order but
truly a new world order. What we need right now are statesmen
of the caliber of those who guided us in the West at the end
of World War II, and gave us the liberal, open political and
economic system that has worked so well. We are at a moment
in history that comes perhaps only every half-century; there
is a chance to design the shape of what's ahead of us. And
you, Mr. President, are not only a man of action but
obviously also a man of ideas. Stay on board. Continue to be
a part of this new drama. We need you.

   Fresh Wave of Cutbacks
   Is Hitting All Sectors,
   Leaving Few Options

   Another surge of layoffs has begun, reflecting the effects
of the junk bond market's slide and retailers' troubles, as
well as further corporate retrenchments.
   The fresh wave of cutbacks, which follows a flood earlier
this year, is hitting all sectors of the economy and leaving
companies and employees with fewer options. According to data
compiled by Cleveland-based consultant Dan Lacey, staff
reductions totaling 110,152 were announced in the first
quarter, nearly as many as the 111,285 he counted for all of
1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In recent days, underscoring the troubles in the
financial-services and retail sectors, Bank of New England
said it plans to slash its staff by one-third, and most of
Bonwit Teller's chain of retail stores were ordered closed by
a bankruptcy judge, a move that will affect more than 1,000
jobs. The broad-based nature of the cutbacks was evinced by
Baxter International Inc.'s disclosure that it plans to trim
10% of its 64,300 employees.
   Economists said that the dismissals are more severe east
of the Mississippi, especially in the Northeast and the
Mid-Atlantic regions where the economy is softest. In Boston,
for example, three industries are suffering at once: health
care, high technology and finance. As a result, said
compensation consultant John Kieley, "the chance of
employment on the outside isn't what it was" for displaced
managers.
   Nationally, the layoff rate in March was unchanged from
February's 0.424% of the labor force, reported economist
Geoffrey H. Moore, who compiles the figure. But the March
level, above the year-earlier 0.372%, was the highest in
three years.
   Despite all the personnel cutbacks, there has been a "near
balancing" with overall hiring, says Stuart Hoffman, chief
economist at PNC Financial Corp., noting that the nation's
civilian jobless rate remains relatively stable. It edged
lower last month to 5.2% from February's 5.3% rate but is
slightly above the 5% level of a year ago. But the Labor
Department's survey of businesses found that employers'
payrolls grew by a meager 26,000 during the month,
disappointing many economists.
   Mr. Hoffman noted, too, that those laid off aren't
necessarily those being hired. Job losers among civilian
employees rose to 3.4 million last month from the
year-earlier 3.2 million, with the biggest losses coming in
the manufacturing, construction, business and health-care
services and the retail sectors.
   Some job losers are having an easier time getting rehired
than others. Ford Harding, a Millburn, N.J., labor market
analyst, says clerical workers are in great demand and aren't
having trouble finding work. A recruiter told Mr. Harding
recently that he was "very pleased" with the clerical people
he's picked up since Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
bankruptcy-law filing.
   But many dismissed professionals and people with
specialized skills are facing career changes. "There's no
question that workers in this country are going to have to
adapt to career changes more frequently than they have in the
past," said Mr. Harding. Among other things, he cited Wall
Street "gossip" that suggests most of Drexel's professional
employees "will have to find another way to make a living."
   For many analysts, this year's stream of staff trimmings
chiefly represents the second stage of corporate
belt-tightening that began in the mid-1980s. This time,
however, the retrenchment is "cutting into the bone," argued
Robert Brudno, an executive headhunter in Washington, D.C. He
points to a rise in the number of senior managers out of work
and believes such dismissals may leave companies "not only
lean and mean, but hobbled."
   Reflecting the softness for senior-level jobs,
corporations' recruiting of senior executives fell 3% in the
first quarter from a year earlier, according to the quarterly
survey by Korn-Ferry International, the Los Angeles
recruiting company.
   A copycat mentality also has appeared as companies see
downsizing steps competitors are taking and follow suit.
"They're saying: `This is the perfect time to do it. The guy
down the street is doing it, and the guy up the street did
it. We won't look so bad,'" said Mr. Kieley, the compensation
consultant.
   What is clear is that the number of companies that retain
"no layoff" policies has shrunk sharply. Mr. Lacey, the
Cleveland consultant, cites broad cuts announced recently at
usually paternalistic employers, such as American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and
Eastman Kodak Co. "Companies that have sworn they never get
rid of people are getting rid of people," he said.
   A Boston University study suggests that only 13 companies
with more than 1,000 employees still have no-layoff policies,
including Delta Air Lines, Federal Express Corp., and S.C.
Johnson Co.
   Old rules about cutbacks also appear to be changing. In
the past, companies would pare back in the third quarter,
before year-end balance sheets were computed and prior to
Christmas, when it was deemed cruel to fire someone. But last
year, suggests Mr. Lacey's data, the number of permanent
staff cuts accelerated as the year went on, reaching a peak
of 67,140 in the last quarter, nearly three times as many as
in the previous quarter. The trend has continued into 1990.
   Mr. Kieley said many companies are forgoing offering
early-retirement windows to reduce their staffs because they
fear their best employees will take the offers. Instead, many
are reverting to straight firings to shrink their staffs.
   While some companies are offering generous severance
payments and benefits, others are doing less. Ilene Leff, a
management consultant in Manhattan, walked into a Drexel
office recently to see a banner that said, "Severance pay,
when and if it is paid, will be sent to your home." A
spokesman for Drexel said it is true that, for the roughly
4,500 employees who have been laid off since its
bankruptcy-protection filing, it's an open question whether
severance will be paid.
   At Baxter International, officials still are working to
identify which employees will be offered involuntary early
retirement packages as opposed to regular severance benefits.
The Morton Grove, Ill., hospital-supplies giant doesn't
anticipate any additional cuts beyond the 10% trimming
announced last week.
   Still, said Tony Rucci, senior vice president for human
resources at Baxter, people working in major corporations
must be "realistic enough to assume that the prospect" of
losing their jobs is greater today than ever.

   Genentech Wins
   Major Victory
   For Drug TPA

   Genentech Inc. won a major victory for its flagship
product, TPA, when a jury found that the Wellcome Foundation
and Genetics Institute Inc. infringed on three Genentech
patents.
   The jury also denied antitrust claims filed by Wellcome
against Genentech and a claim by Genetics Institute of unfair
competition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   TPA is a blood clot-dissolving drug used in the treatment
of heart attacks. Genentech said it plans to file for an
injunction to prevent London-based Wellcome PLC from
marketing its own form of TPA, called Duteplase, and to
prevent Genetics Institute from marketing its
second-generation version of TPA in the U.S.
   "The victory was as complete as it could be," said Stephen
Raines, Genentech's vice president of intellectual property.
The jury, however, didn't award any monetary damages to
Genentech, which is based in South San Francisco, Calif.
   Mr. Raines said the jury's verdict shows Genentech holds
"exceedingly broad patents" for TPA and predicted the
decision would "have a chilling effect on companies that want
to take a patented product and try to market it after making
minor revisions."
   Martin Sherwood, a Wellcome spokesman, said the company is
still reviewing the decision, reached Friday in U.S. District
Court in Delaware. He noted that a 1987 decision by British
courts, later upheld on appeal, "deemed a Genentech patent
invalid for essentially the same compound and processes." The
U.S. decision "is therefore the opposite of the U.K.
decision, and we'll have to consider whether to appeal."
   Genetics Institute officials couldn't be reached for
comment yesterday.
   Genentech, which spent five years and $200 million
developing TPA, began marketing the drug -- which it sells
under the brand name Activase -- in 1987. The next year,
Genentech brought a patent infringement suit against Wellcome
and its subsidiaries, including Burroughs-Wellcome, and
against its U.S. collaborator, Genetics Institute. Wellcome
responded with an antitrust action against Genentech;
Genetics Institute, of Cambridge, Mass., filed an unfair
competition suit against Genentech.
   Genentech's sales of TPA in 1989 grew 30%, to $196.4
million. But the outlook for TPA this year is clouded by
competition from a recently approved drug -- called Eminase
-- from SmithKline Beecham PLC, and a study last month which
found that Hoechst AG's streptokinase, an older, much less
expensive treatment, prolongs life as well as TPA.
   Wellcome is best known for its AIDS drug, AZT.
   Genentech, a biotechnology concern, recently agreed to
sell a 60% stake to Roche Holding Inc. of Switzerland for
$2.1 billion.
   In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Genentech closed unchanged at $26. In national
over-the-counter trading, Genetics Institute fell 25 cents to
$37.75.

   Consumption Tax
   Expected to Clear
   Canada's House

   OTTAWA -- Canada's House of Commons is expected to approve
by Wednesday legislation to introduce a 7% consumption tax,
effective Jan. 1.
   The contested bill also needs to be approved by the
Senate, an appointed body. The Senate, which is controlled by
the opposition Liberal Party, is expected to eventually pass
the legislation, but only after a lengthy fight with Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party
government.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposed tax has provoked widespread protests.
Anti-tax demonstrations are to be held in Toronto tomorrow to
coincide with Mr. Mulroney's scheduled meeting in the city
with President Bush.
   The planned levy, known as the goods and services tax, has
contributed to a sharp fall in the Conservative Party's
popularity. According to a recent Gallup Poll, only 17% of
decided Canadians support the Conservatives, the lowest
rating for a governing party in the 48-year history of Gallup
party-preference polling in Canada.
   Mr. Mulroney told the House of Commons Friday that "doing
what is right for the nation oftentimes means doing things
that are difficult and unpopular."
   The planned tax will replace an outmoded and more narrowly
based 13.5% manufacturers' sales tax. The new levy is similar
to the value-added tax systems that have been introduced in
48 other countries in the past 20 years. The Bush
administration has ruled out such a tax for the U.S.
   Canadian businesses are to levy the new tax on their
domestic sales. They are to be allowed to claim a credit for
any tax they pay on their purchases of goods and services.
The burden of the tax is to fall on the consumer.
   Critics of the planned tax claim it would be inflationary,
would weigh more heavily on the poor than on the rich, and
would dissuade the government from cutting spending. The
government estimates it would boost consumer prices 1.25%
next year.
   Supporters of the tax say that, in replacing the existing
sales tax, it would foster savings, encourage manufacturing,
and strengthen exports.
   The tax isn't to be applied to basic groceries,
prescription drugs, and medical services. Credits will be
paid to low-income Canadians to offset the tax's impact.
   Labor unions are already demanding compensation for the
inflationary impact of the tax, and consumers are expected to
increase their spending later this year to beat the tax's
introduction. Housing construction this year will remain
"relatively buoyant" as builders rush to complete and sell
houses prior to the imposition of the tax, said Toronto
Dominion Bank. Some auto buying, however, is expected to be
deferred until next year because the planned tax will be less
burdensome on cars than the existing sales tax. An Ottawa
funeral home, in radio advertisements, recommends making
arrangements for prepaid funerals before Sept. 1 to avoid the
tax.

   MOSCOW -- The Soviet Union announced its first trade
deficit in 14 years amid growing signs President Mikhail
Gorbachev is considering big purchases of Western consumer
goods to cushion the impact of his economic overhaul program.
   According to official statistics published over the
weekend, the Soviet trade balance swung to a deficit of 3.3
billion rubles ($5.4 billion) in 1989 from a surplus of 2.1
billion rubles in 1988. A drop in exports of oil and other
raw materials and increased imports of Western goods were the
main causes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government statistics office also issued preliminary
figures for the first three months of this year that showed
continued deterioration of the economy. Industrial production
dropped 1.2% before adjustment for inflation in the first
quarter, largely because of strikes and ethnic unrest in
parts of the country. At the same time, inflation showed no
sign of slowing, with average wages rising by 9%, according
to the Izvestia newspaper.
   Faced with such economic problems and widespread
shortages, Mr. Gorbachev is expected to unveil a package of
economic reform measures soon, perhaps this week. He has
called for a "radicalization" of economic overhaul involving
a push toward setting up a market economy, but few details of
his plans have leaked out.
   But a senior West German banker who met leading Soviet
officials last week said the Kremlin is clearly looking for
new credits to finance a big import program. The banker, who
asked not to be identified, said Moscow is hoping for
substantial assistance from Western Europe and the U.S.,
particularly following next month's superpower summit.
   The Soviet government so far has been reluctant to embark
on a crash import program, which Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov has warned would further weaken the economy. But some
of Mr. Gorbachev's advisers say the planned reforms, which
are expected to include big price increases for many goods,
must be accompanied by measures to win public confidence and
curb potential unrest.
   "The president and his cabinet must be ready to take
several painful and unpopular decisions, and at the same time
they must keep the trust of the people," Nikolai Petrakov, an
economist who has become a personal adviser to Mr. Gorbachev,
told a Soviet newspaper last week. He advocated taking out
large credits to buy consumer goods, and even raised the
prospect of seeking large-scale assistance from the West
along the lines of a Marshall plan.
   If Mr. Gorbachev follows such advice, he will be picking
the worst time in years to embark on a credit-financed
spending spree. The cost of Soviet borrowing on Western
financial markets has soared in recent weeks, largely because
of political upheaval in the U.S.S.R. and long delays on
payments by Soviet organizations to Western companies.
   Mr. Petrakov and several other leading Soviet economists
spent the weekend in a dacha outside Moscow, working out
details of the program that will be submitted to Mr.
Gorbachev and his council of presidential advisers this week.
Soviet officials say privately that several versions could be
submitted, enabling the president to choose between drastic
Polish-style measures to free prices and sell off state
industries and more cautious moves involving a gradual
transition to a market economy.
   Leonid Abalkin, a deputy prime minister in charge of
economic overhaul, said last week that the Soviet Union won't
copy the Polish model because of substantial differences
between the economies of the two nations. But he and other
officials concede that speedy moves are needed to shake off
the old system of bureaucratic economic management, put more
goods into Soviet stores and curb a runaway money supply that
could spark serious inflation. Soviet economists estimate
people are sitting on about 165 billion rubles that they
would spend if they could find something to buy.
   Soviet officials say opposition to a rapid move toward a
full-fledged market system is strongest among members of the
Communist Party Central Committee and the labor unions. If
Mr. Gorbachev goes ahead with a radical option, he would also
be undermining the position of his prime minister, Mr.
Ryzhkov, who only last December presented a more cautious
economic program to parliament.
   But the gloomy trade figures paint a picture of an economy
in need of an urgent fix. The Soviet Union last year was
forced to import 360 million rubles worth of soap and
detergent, more than six times the amount of the previous
year, after panic-buying broke out among consumers. Moscow
tripled purchases of coffee and vegetable oil to make up for
domestic shortages, while grain imports jumped almost 6% to
37 million metric tons. The major beneficiaries of the boost
in imports were West Germany, the U.S., Italy, Britain and
other West European nations.
   By contrast, oil exports, the Soviet Union's largest
foreign-currency earner, dropped almost 12% to 127.3 million
metric tons, and coal and steel sales were also far below
levels of the previous year. Although Moscow increased its
exports to Western industrialized nations, it cut back on
deliveries to Eastern Europe.
   Overall, imports soared to 72.1 billion rubles from 65
billion rubles in 1989, while exports rose only slightly to
68.8 billion rubles from 67.1 billion rubles.

   Lotus to Acquire Novell for $1.5 Billion;
   Possible Challenge to Microsoft Is Seen

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp. is making a
bold play for software industry leadership with its surprise
agreement to acquire Novell Inc., of Provo, Utah, for $1.5
billion in stock.
   The action solves Lotus's biggest long-term problem --
being a one-product company. Since Novell has more than half
the market for network software, the combined company is
likely to play a big technological role as other software
companies design their programs to work in the networks of
personal computers that are spreading through offices. And if
their marketing arms can sell each other's products, they
will get the attention of many customers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said that if the two companies successfully merge
their strengths and offset their weaknesses, they may provide
a counterweight to the industry dominance of Microsoft Inc.,
Redmond, Wash., which competes with both Lotus and Novell.
   "The merger rearranges the power structure of the software
industry," said Aaron Goldberg, a market researcher with
International Data Corp., Framingham, Mass. Combined, the two
companies' sales are expected to top $1.2 billion this year;
analysts expect Microsoft to have $1.1 billion in revenue in
its fiscal year ending June 30.
   Lotus agreed to acquire Novell for 41.6 million shares of
stock with a market value of about $1.5 billion. It would be
the third-biggest computer industry merger ever after
Burroughs Corp.'s merger with Sperry Corp. to form Unisys
Inc. and General Motors Corp.'s $2.5 billion acquisition of
Electronic Data Systems Inc.
   Lotus was once the industry leader because of the success
of its best-selling 1-2-3 spreadsheet. But its failure to
come up with other hits has enabled Microsoft, which has come
out with a slew of popular products, to surpass it.
   Timothy McCollum, a software analyst with Dean Witter,
said, "This is a very good growth area for Lotus to get
into."
   Networking personal computers together is a booming
business because personal computers are becoming powerful
enough to do the jobs of minicomputers and even mainframes in
corporate and government offices.
   However, Mr. McCollum cautioned that merging the two
companies may prove difficult. John McCarthy, an analyst with
Forrester Research, Cambridge, Mass., predicted corporate
culture shock when the "MBA yuppies from Lotus go out to
Provo."
   Both companies have been sharp stock gainers in the past
month as technology stocks came into favor. But on Friday,
investors -- worried that the merger may prove difficult, and
disappointed that Novell holders won't get a premium --
showed their displeasure. In over-the-counter trading, Lotus
stock fell $2 to $34.25. Novell stock fell $4.125 to $38.75.
   The two companies described the combination as a merger of
equals. Lotus will exchange stock equal to the average value
of Novell stock in the past 10 days. It said it will swap
1.19131 Lotus shares for each Novell share. After the merger,
Novell holders will own about 48% of the combined company.
   Lotus's Jim P. Manzi will remain chairman, president and
chief executive officer of the combined company. Raymond
Noorda, Novell's chairman, will become vice chairman and
chief executive of the Novell subsidiary.
   One factor that helped make the agreement possible was
that Mr. Noorda is 66 years old, and doesn't have a clear
successor. Mr. Noorda said he doesn't have any plans to
retire, but acknowledged that the lack of a second in command
"leads to some insecurity among investors."
   Both companies are highly profitable, fast-growing
software concerns. Last year Lotus reported net income of $68
million, or $1.61 a share, on sales of $556 million. Sales
had been hampered last year until Lotus finally started
shipping updated versions of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet during the
summer. This year most analysts expect strong growth.
   Novell reported net income of $48.5 million, or $1.46 a
share, on revenue of $421.9 million for its fiscal year ended
Oct. 28. Novell has about 52% of the market for software that
lets networks of personal computers share printers,
information and programs.
   If the merger works as planned, the two companies will
complement each other. "Our view is this is a powerful
combination. Sales and marketing are very complementary,"
said Mr. Manzi. Lotus expects to sell its network software,
including a new program called Notes, through the resellers
who handle Novell networks. Novell expects Lotus's
salespeople, who deal with big corporations, will help it get
its Netware into more offices.
   In terms of technology, Mr. Manzi said Lotus is making its
applications easy to use in networks where users share
information, rather than only in individual PCs. With Lotus's
backing for Novell, other software vendors may design their
programs to work well with Novell's Netware rather than
emphasizing Microsoft's competing LAN Manager.
   The combined companies may resemble the structure of
Microsoft, analysts said. Microsoft sells both software
applications, such as its Excel spreadsheet, and operating
systems that control the inner workings of computers and
networks. Now Lotus will sell applications software such as
its 1-2-3 spreadsheet, and operating systems for networks.

   MONTREAL -- Repap Enterprises Inc. "isn't as confident" as
it was six weeks ago that it will at least match 1989 net
income this year, said George Petty, chairman and chief
executive, after a presentation to analysts here.
   Last year, Repap had net income of 93.1 million Canadian
dollars (US$79.7 million), or C$1.79 (US$1.53) a share, on
revenue of C$1.22 billion. In February, Mr. Petty said in an
interview that the pulp and coated paper producer expected to
at least match 1989 net income this year.

   Mr. Petty said the first half looks
"tougher-than-expected," but Repap is "still very optimistic"
about the second half. He said the Canadian dollar and
interest rates are higher than anticipated this year, both of
which hurt earnings.
   In over-the-counter trading Friday, Repap closed at $7.50,
up 12.5 cents.

   Grand Met Plans to Boost Its Presence
   In Europe in Wake of Britain, U.S. Deals

   LONDON -- Having risen to prominence through splashy deals
in Britain and the U.S., Grand Metropolitan PLC is looking to
Europe -- but with a softer touch.
   Chairman Allen Sheppard says his company, which currently
derives 90% of its trading profit from Britain and the U.S.,
will mount greater efforts to increase its presence in both
East and West Europe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Using the brand names acquired in last year's $5.7 billion
acquisition of Pillsbury Inc., Mr. Sheppard said Grand Met
plans to use the Green Giant frozen food, Haagen Dasz luxury
ice cream and Burger King fast food names as springboards for
wider growth in Europe.
   "We have substantial ambitions there," Mr. Sheppard said
of the company's designs on Europe in the 1990s.
   In the meantime, Grand Met will concentrate on
consolidating its existing businesses after a frantic
expansion period in the late 1980s. But even during its
period of rest, the chairman said the company wouldn't pass
up a chance to pick up a particularly relevant add-on to its
food, drink and retailing businesses.
   Because much of the European food market is highly
fragmented, regionalized, family-owned and diffuse, "we've
got to be very careful," the chairman said. "We could be busy
fools and make an acquisition a week, but we'd probably end
up with bits and pieces of food companies spread across
Europe. The market would wonder why we did it." Instead, Mr.
Sheppard sees a continuing process of "small but relevant"
food acquisitions in Europe during the next several years.
   But some people in London's financial community are
concerned that the company appears too acquisition-hungry and
might be tempted to devour another company as a follow-up to
its Pillsbury purchase. "It's not that Grand Met would be
overly stretched, but thoughts of another deal give people
indigestion," said one analyst, who asked not to be
identified.
   Grand Met's gearing, or its ratio of debt to shareholders'
funds, stood at nearly 200% immediately after the Pillsbury
acquisition. But the company has worked hard to bring its
balance sheet back in line. With the completion of its
recently announced asset swap with Elders IXL, its gearing
will be sheared to 65%. Once it finds a buyer for Alpo pet
food in the U.S., the level will come down to about 50%.
   Nonetheless, Mr. Sheppard was quick to soothe the nerves
of unconverted critics. "In the foreseeable future, we don't
envisage making another macro bid over #500 million pounds
{$821.1 million}," he said, adding a disclaimer that "unless
we get some fantastic opportunity that comes along which we
just can't and shouldn't resist."
   As for the European drinks operation, Mr. Sheppard said
Grand Met already has well-established and sophisticated
distribution links built up during the past five years in
just about every European country. Joint ventures include
some of the best names in European spirits like Cinzano,
Grand Marnier and Metaxa. The brands owned outright read like
a Who's Who of the drinks world, including J&amp;B Scotch whisky
and Smirnoff vodka.
   Grand Met recently said it is negotiating to buy a 20%
stake in France's Remy Martin for #100 million. The deal
fills what many analysts saw as the last remaining gap in
Grand Met's drinks line-up, an internationally branded
cognac. Remy's portfolio also includes premium label Krug and
Piper-Heidsieck champagnes, orange-flavored liqueur Cointreau
and a number of leading wines.
   In its latest earnings report for the year ended in
September, Grand Met had a 27% leap in pretax profit to #732
million from #575 million a year earlier. Although figures
aren't disaggregated by division and geography, world-wide
drinks business accounted for #2.04 billion in sales and #230
million in trading profit in the latest results, compared
with #1.04 billion and #143 million, respectively, the year
before.
   By sector, 1990 is expected to bring 38% of its trading
profit from drinks, 31% from retailing and 31% from food.
   Grand Met enjoys the position of being the world's largest
wine and spirits seller and the eighth-largest food group.
   There's also a move afoot to bring more of Grand Met's
Burger King restaurants to the Continent. Mr. Sheppard said
the company is exploring opportunities in France, Spain and
West Germany for more exposure. Its purchase of Wimpey in the
United Kingdom has given Grand Met a "more active stance" in
allowing it to push toward the continent. Giving Burger King
a toehold in Europe will start in West Germany, Mr. Sheppard
said.
   Mr. Sheppard sees Eastern Europe as fertile ground for
Green Giant products, where there could be a swap of its
agricultural know-how and technology in exchange for abundant
land and labor. Multinational sourcing of food products has
become a more critical quest for Grand Met recently, Mr.
Sheppard said, especially in light of last year's drought in
the U.S.
   Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany are the natural
areas where the company would look for new business.

   SCOTTS VALLEY, Calif. -- Seagate Technology Inc. said it
received a statutory notice from the Internal Revenue Service
that it may owe up to $112 million in taxes.
   The maker of disk drives said it was notified of a
"possible deficiency" for the taxable years 1981 to 1987.
Seagate said it believes it has "meritorious defenses" to the
IRS adjustments. The company said it is preparing a petition
to the U.S. Tax Court.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Seagate said it believes the likely outcome of the
litigation won't have a material effect on its financial
position.
   A Seagate spokeswoman said the company wouldn't explain
why the government believes it owes the money. "There isn't
anything further I can say. We have no comment beyond the
press release. That's all the information that's available."
   In the six months ended Dec. 31, Seagate had net income of
$59.2 million, or $1.03 a share, on revenue of $1.07 billion.
   The dispute is believed to involve how Seagate accounts
for its profits from overseas operations. Seagate has
manufacturing facilities in Asia, and can increase and
possibly defer overseas profits depending on the prices it
charges its domestic units for overseas production.

   Breaking Away and Getting Away With It

   Ad agency executives with visions of breaking away to set
up their own shops can take hope from a breakaway group in
California that has won the first round in its fight for
independence.
   Thus far, a federal district judge in Los Angeles has
ruled in favor of the little guys. If the group is ultimately
successful, the case may provide an object lesson in how to
break away -- and allow old clients to follow -- without
spending a fortune in litigation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That wasn't the case when a group of top executives broke
away from WPP Group's Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein to set
up a rival shop, Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp; Partners. Several
Lord Geller clients defected to the new agency, prompting
Lord Geller to sue for breach of fiduciary duty, among other
things. Last fall, the Lord Einstein renegades and Young &amp;
Rubicam, which gave the new agency financial backing, agreed
to pay $7 million to settle the suit.
   The California case involves a group of executives who
resigned in January from ad agency AC&amp;R's health-care unit,
based in Irvine. The four executives, virtually all of the
health care unit's top management, immediately started their
own new ad agency, Esprit Communications, in Costa Mesa. At
least four AC&amp;R clients have defected to Esprit since then,
including Beckman Instruments and a Baxter International
health-care unit. Other clients are in negotiations to make
the switch.
   "We have notices of termination from seven or eight
clients, and admissions that {most} are negotiating with
those people" at Esprit, says AC&amp;R's attorney, Maggie Heim.
   AC&amp;R, a unit of giant Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, filed suit
against the tiny new agency in early February. The suit
charges Esprit and its principals with breach of fiduciary
duty, breach of contract, and violating trade secrets, among
other claims. It seeks at least $4 million in compensatory
damages and unspecified punitive damages.
   But last week, in a severe setback, it lost its motion for
a preliminary injunction, which would have prevented Esprit
from doing business with AC&amp;R's clients for two years. In his
decision, Judge James M. Ideman held that AC&amp;R didn't show "a
combination of probable success on the merits and the
possibility of irreparable injury." The decision effectively
allows Esprit to take any and all AC&amp;R clients who approach
it.
   Indeed, in his opinion, the judge chastised AC&amp;R for
seeking the injunction. Esprit, he said, "will be most likely
forced out of business" if the injunction is granted. What's
more, he chided AC&amp;R for complaining about breaches of
contracts by its clients: AC&amp;R "is attempting to hold
defendants liable for alleged breaches by its own clients,
instead of suing those clients," he said.
   AC&amp;R's lawyer, Ms. Heim, says she is considering an
appeal, and that in any case she is proceeding to a trial.
"We still feel we have a really good damage claim," she says.
She adds that the Lord Geller suit hasn't been helpful to her
case because "unfortunately it isn't a published opinion, and
it's two different courts."
   The Lord Geller case clearly has helped Esprit's
principals and others like them learn a lesson, though. That
case largely hinged on whether the breakaway group solicited
Lord Geller clients before they left Lord Geller, a question
never settled in open court. "We were real aware of the
solicitation issue, and very careful not to solicit because
of all the instances where this has been an issue," says
Elizabeth Hargreaves, an Esprit partner. "We definitely
sought legal counsel so we would do it in a way that was
legally sound."
   That doesn't mean the Esprit group is home free. AC&amp;R
contends that the Esprit executives did solicit clients while
still at AC&amp;R, and vows to prove it in court. And even Ms.
Hargreaves concedes that exactly what constitutes
solicitation is a fuzzy matter.
   The case is coming out in favor of the little guys so far,
but lawyers caution that could be reversed -- and even if it
isn't, it won't necessarily set any precedents because such
cases depend on the particular set of facts involved. But
they say the legacy of the Lord Geller case is that
executives even thinking of breaking away are taking a much
harder look at possible legal troubles, especially the
solicitation of clients or employees.
   "The Lord Geller situation brought to the fore many of
these legal issues," says David Versfelt, a lawyer with
Donovan, Leisure, Newton &amp; Irvine. "I think there are an
awful lot of advertising people out there who are more
sensitive to the legal traps of the situation than there were
before."

   Consolidation at Heileman
                                                                                                       

   G. Heileman Brewing, which has five agencies creating ads
for its many beer brands, said it plans to consolidate its
advertising at one agency.
   Executives close to Heileman said financial pressures at
its parent company, Bond Corp. Holdings, were causing budgets
on the individual brands to be diminished. But Ian Crichton,
Heileman senior executive vice president, marketing and
sales, said Heileman will spend more on advertising its
brands this year than it ever has, estimating the total
expenditure at $20 million to $25 million.
   "We feel we'll get a bigger bang for our buck with one
agency," Mr. Crichton said.
   Four Heileman agencies agreed to participate in the
review. One, Young &amp; Rubicam, declined. Since 1986, Young &amp;
Rubicam has handled Heileman's biggest brand, Old Style, and
other brands including Special Export. People close to the
agency said the shop questioned Heileman's ability to
financially support the brands. An agency spokeswoman
declined to comment except to say, "We're extremely proud of
our relationship and our work."
   The other agencies are W.B. Doner, which handles Colt 45;
Chiat/Day/Mojo, which handles Rainier and Lone Star; Borders,
Perrin &amp; Norrander; and Della Femina, McNamee WCRS. A
decision is expected by June 1.
   Two outside agencies probably will be invited to
participate in the review. Industry executives said one will
be Campbell-Mithun-Esty, Chicago, a unit of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi. C-M-E, however, currently handles the Corona beer
account, a piece of business that would be a conflict. The
agency declined to comment.

   Loss of a Star Can Cast Shadow Over Firm

   Can the magic continue without the magician? That's the
question that faces any organization that loses a superstar.
   The loss of an extraordinary leader can mean wrenching
changes in a company's culture. Anguish and uncertainty often
ensue. For those who succeed superstars, there is opportunity
-- but also the pressure of high expectations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consider the daunting tasks facing Morris Smith and
Malcolm S. Forbes Jr. Mr. Smith was named last month to
succeed Peter Lynch, who's retiring after winning renown --
and a reputation as one of the nation's top stock-pickers --
while running Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund. Now the
nation's largest stock mutual fund, it exploded to $13
billion in assets from $20 million under Mr. Lynch's 13-year
guidance.
   And Mr. Forbes took the reins at Forbes Inc. last month
after the death of his flamboyant father. Malcolm S. Forbes
Sr., a masterful self-promoter, had gained enormous
recognition for his magazine -- and attracted advertisers and
subscribers -- by exploiting the publicity value of his
wealth and personality.
   Fidelity and Forbes won't fade away because their
charismatic chiefs are gone, but both companies have a
problem. Beyond coping with emotional strain, they must
regain their footing with employees, clients, advertisers and
investors, among others. "You worry, when one person has been
so responsible for business practices, that when they leave
they create an enormous void," says William A. Sahlman, a
Harvard Business School professor.
   The stakes are often highest in small companies,
especially start-ups or family businesses where there isn't a
clear successor or a strong enough management team. But major
companies can be vulnerable too. How critical is Lee A.
Iacocca to Chrysler Corp.? Could Trump Organization survive
without developer Donald? What about Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
without investment genius Warren E. Buffett?
   When a company and its star are synonymous, the star's
fall can throw the business into crisis. Since the 1986 death
of designer Perry Ellis, the fashion house that bears his
name has lost many important employees, gone through several
management changes and struggled to maintain its prestige --
and sales -- in light of criticism that the quality and
appeal of its clothing lines have dropped. Michael Milken,
one of the business world's most acclaimed stars for much of
the '80s, almost single-handedly created the market for junk
bonds and fueled Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s success in the
decade. But federal charges of racketeering and securities
fraud pulled the plug on Mr. Milken -- part of a swirl of
events that led to the junk-bond market's woes and Drexel's
recent collapse.
   Companies needn't always plummet when a star exits. It
often depends on timing. Apple Computer Inc. forced out
founder Steven Jobs when his entrepreneurial vision and style
were judged incompatible with its needs as a mature
organization. The company remains a major player in its
industry. But if Mr. Jobs were to leave his nascent Next Inc.
now, that company might have a short future, says Harvard's
Mr. Sahlman, because Mr. Jobs is clearly its greatest asset.
   Big companies normally insist that potential successors
are in place to carry on. Such planning is critical for any
company to avoid serious damage from the abrupt loss of a
superstar, visionary or veteran leader, management
specialists say. They must also move quickly to put
contingency plans in place and make them public, lest
speculation grow that the ship will sink because its rudder
is gone.
   Malcolm Jr. had been president and deputy editor in chief
of Forbes, and his ascension was no surprise. Still, he led a
news conference at Forbes headquarters on a Sunday, the day
after his father's death, to get out word of a smooth
transition.
   When Mr. Lynch went public with his plans to leave,
Fidelity announced the same day that it had selected Mr.
Smith to succeed him and began publicizing his solid record
running another Fidelity stock fund. The company braced for a
flood of investors to redeem their Magellan shares, but it
turned out to be "a fairly meaningless number," says George
A. Vanderheiden, a Fidelity vice president who will oversee
Mr. Smith.
   Management specialists say Mr. Smith will be under heavy
scrutiny for months, and probably longer, as investors assess
whether he's worthy of handling their money. If he
underperforms the market, "the media, the public will begin
to say life without Peter Lynch just won't work," says Jay A.
Conger, professor of organizational behavior at McGill
University.
   Companies shouldn't expect miracles from a superstar's
successor, Mr. Conger says. Truly exceptional business
personalities are rare, he says, and they seldom cultivate
others to have the same vision or inspirational skills. For
one, they may not want the competition. They also can be so
imposing that they drive away or stifle those who otherwise
might shine.
   This is often the case in family operations, where
children may never feel free to be their own person. "Very
few children have outperformed their fathers," Mr. Conger
says. The late Mr. Forbes, who inherited the empire his
father started, and Mr. Trump, whose father got him going in
real estate, are notable exceptions.
   More typical is Frederick Wang, who never managed to carry
Wang Laboratories Inc. in the style of his father, founder An
Wang. The elder Mr. Wang, who died last month, forced his son
to resign as president and chief executive officer last year
after a string of losses and other problems.
   When companies lose an important figure, specialists
suggest, they should quickly remind employees and others that
the organization lives on, that "no one individual can create
success or failure for the whole," says Mary Anne Devanna, a
Columbia University management professor.
   After years of plugging Mr. Lynch and his record, Fidelity
is careful now to stress that Magellan represents just 11% of
its assets and that investors needn't worry. "This is a
well-oiled machine," Mr. Vanderheiden says.
   At Forbes, Editor James W. Michaels says there is "a
determination to show that there is a lot more to this
organization and this magazine than simply one person."
   At the same time, management specialists say companies
would be wise to preserve some of the values of extraordinary
figures, in part to help perpetuate their charisma. "This is
where an artful leader will jump in and gain a sympathetic
edge" before advancing a new agenda, says John L. Ward,
professor of private enterprise at Loyola University of
Chicago.
   But guiding philosophies must be selected with care.
"Think" remains part of the culture at International Business
Machines Corp., a legacy of founder Thomas Watson Sr. He also
dictated that IBM salesmen wear blue suits and white
button-down shirts. Neither preaching has harmed the company,
but "if he had said `mainframes,' that would have killed
them," Mr. Conger contends.

   U.S. Toughens Stance Toward Iraq
   To Pressure It to Halt Arms Programs

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. appears headed for a tougher policy
toward the brutal regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Some administration officials argue privately that it's
time to abandon Washington's soft-glove approach to Iraq.
They want to put Baghdad on notice that the U.S. will tighten
the economic screws unless Iraq radically alters its
behavior, specifically by curtailing its efforts to develop
nuclear and chemical weapons.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The tougher stance is most evident in Congress, especially
the House, where a drive to impose economic sanctions already
is under way. The ever-cautious Bush administration will
oppose these efforts, White House officials say, because it
believes quiet diplomacy is more effective than legislation.
But even some administration Mideast analysts concede that
the U.S. has little to show for its attempts to prod Baghdad
toward moderation.
   Arguments for a tougher policy were fueled by the recent
reports that Iraq tried to smuggle nuclear-bomb trigger
devices out of the U.S., and even more so by President
Hussein's threat to use chemical weapons against Israel if
his country is attacked.
   In addition, an Iraqi-American was indicted Friday by a
federal grand jury in California for allegedly participating
in an Iraqi plot to kill two foes of the Iraqi government in
the U.S.
   Recent concerns about Iraq were first aroused by a speech
Mr. Hussein delivered in Jordan in February. For the first
time since the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988, the Iraqi
president questioned the need for the continuing U.S. naval
presence in the Persian Gulf. Moderate Arab states told
Washington privately that they disagreed with that view, and
they voiced worries that the Iraqi leader was trying to give
himself a freer hand to dominate the region.
   Before the Iran-Iraq war, Iraq regularly threatened its
neighbors. Kuwait faced Iraqi claims to part of its
territory; Jordan encountered pressure from Baghdad whenever
it became involved in efforts to achieve an
Israeli-Palestinian peace; and Saudi Arabia worried about the
vulnerability of its oil fields to the huge Iraqi military
machine to its north.
   Iraq moderated its behavior and improved its relations
with the U.S. when it was bogged down in its war with Iran.
The U.S., in turn, softened its stance, and American policy
since then has been designed to keep Baghdad in the moderate
fold. But some analysts say the February speech signaled that
Mr. Hussein really hasn't altered his long-term intention to
dominate the region. These officials suggest that the mild
U.S. policy now may be jeopardizing Washington's Arab
friends.
   While the accommodative U.S. policy appears to have
failed, there are reasons to believe that Saddam Hussein
could be vulnerable to increased U.S. pressure.
   Iraq is trying to rebuild its war-torn economy and badly
needs Western help. Sanctions legislation proposed by Rep.
Howard Berman (D., Calif.) would deny the Iraq credit from
the U.S. Export-Import Bank, ban exports of items that could
have a military use and commit the U.S. to oppose any loan or
other assistance to it from international financial
institutions.
   But the sanctions bill wouldn't ban agricultural credit
guarantees, even though farm sales are the bulk of U.S.
exports to Iraq. An aide to Rep. Berman says such a
restriction would make the bill unacceptable to grain-state
legislators. The aide argues that the bill, nevertheless,
would impede Iraq's rebuilding efforts.
   Iraq also may be susceptible to pressure because it soon
could be involved in the kind of international dispute that
pushed it toward moderation in the past. Turkey is building a
dam on the Euphrates River, which supplies water further
downstream to Syria and Iraq. Turkey refuses to commit itself
to a water-sharing agreement, and Syria is a bitter enemy of
Baghdad. So water, the Middle East's most precious commodity,
could produce new tensions and put Iraq, once again, in need
of friends.
   The U.S., meanwhile, may feel compelled to get tough with
Iraq to further its claim to a leadership role in a world of
resurgent democracies. U.S. allies who want to see that
happen could cite the State Department's own words. In its
report this year on human rights, the department calls Iraq's
record "abysmal." The report says that the country uses
torture and summary execution to deal with dissidents and
that freedoms of press, speech, assembly and association are
"virtually nonexistent" under Mr. Hussein's regime.

   HOUSTON -- Coastal Corp. said it will build an oil storage
and trans-shipment facility in San Nicolas, Aruba, where it
is restarting a former Exxon Corp. refinery.
   Coastal, a diversified energy company, said the facility
would include construction of storage tanks that could hold
as much as eight million barrels of crude. That would be in
addition to 3.4 million barrels of storage capacity already
built or under construction at the refinery.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company also said it plans to build a dock capable of
handling ocean tankers that can carry as much as 3.5 million
barrels of crude.
   "The facility gives flexibility in buying crude in large
volumes and shipping it out as needed," a Coastal spokesman
said. The Aruba refinery, scheduled to begin processing
150,000 barrels a day of crude by this summer, will initially
make diesel fuel and heating oils. It will also make
low-sulfur feedstocks that can be shipped to U.S. refineries
for the production of gasoline.
   The Coastal spokesman said the company didn't yet know
what construction costs would be until bids were received.
One industry official estimated the price would exceed $40
million.

   REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   Owls Are People, Too

   No question about it, they're cute. But is the spotted owl
so cute that thousands of families of men, women and children
have to abandon their jobs and homes on its behalf? That's a
rhetorical question. Anyone who follows modern American
politics and the environmental movement knows that if it's a
choice between people and animals today, the animals will
probably win. That was the clear message of a federal report
released last week on an issue that sets about 1,500 pairs of
spotted owls against the people who make their living cutting
down trees in the Pacific Northwest.
   The spotted owl is being used to try to achieve a longtime
environmentalist goal of stopping all logging in the
"old-growth" evergreen national forests that stretch from
Northern California to British Columbia. A team of government
wildlife biologists spent six months studying the creatures
and last week presented its conclusions to a meeting of no
fewer than three subcommittees on Capitol Hill.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Inter-Agency Scientific Committee on Spotted Owl
concluded that the owls are threatened. Currently, mankind
has set aside "SOHAs", or Spotted Owl Habitat Areas, of 300
or so protected acres for each pair of owls. But the SOHAs
apparently aren't big enough, because it turns out that the
spotted owls aren't all that wise.
   They wander into open, already lumbered areas and get
killed by, of all things, the great horned owl. The face of
the horned owl is cute, too, at least to human eyes. But
apparently the horned owl's natural instincts don't respond
to anthropomorphism. Other spotted owls become separated,
don't reproduce or start inbreeding. "By some estimates
(perhaps conservative), spotted owl habitat has been reduced
by about 60% since 1800," said the report. The wildlife
biologists acknowledged, however, that some owl pairs have
been found in "new growth" areas.
   To save the owl, the biologists recommended new "HCAs," or
Habitat Conservation Areas, of at least 12 miles for each 20
owl pairs. In effect, however, that would mean ending all
logging in as much as 40% of the Northwest's national forest
land, some three million acres. This strikes us as a somewhat
unbalanced solution.
   But Congressman Jim Jontz, who represents Kokomo, Indiana,
has adopted the owls as an issue of concern to him, and he
declared how pleased he was by the recommendation. Also, the
man from the Wilderness Society located in Washington, D.C.,
felt vindicated: "The spotted owl is in grave danger and by
extension therefore the ancient forest is also in grave
danger." The Society hadn't made much progress stopping the
loggers in the ancient forest until it adopted the owl as the
basis for a series of lawsuits.
   The environmentalists have won many of their courtroom
victories before federal judges in the Ninth Circuit, in the
wilderness called San Francisco. With the biologists' report,
the Fish and Wildlife Service now won't have much choice but
to list the spotted owl as a formal endangered species this
June. Even more logging will have to cease.
   People in California, Oregon and Washington stand to lose
anywhere from 9,000 to 60,000 logging jobs, not to mention
the thousands of other jobs serving the timber industry
(there isn't much else to do in these timber areas). John
Hampton, president of Willamina Lumber Co., figured the
recommendation would set aside between four million and five
million acres for owl habitat, about $95 million in timber
for each pair of spotted owls. Rep. Bob Smith of Oregon told
the hearing, "To those of you who are unfamiliar with the
spotted owl, I say welcome to the demise of the Pacific
Northwest."
   Logger Jerry Lappell of Forks, Wash., captured the class
nature of the dispute: "We all like spotted owls. The gripe
we've got is with preservationists. I think they're
overeducated and they drive through and judge us in three
hours instead of living here all their life."
   The publicity around these battles that environmentalists
start tends to get presented to the public in all-or-nothing,
good-vs.-evil terms. There's obviously a lot of gray in this
one. Of the 5.1 million acres of national forest inhabited by
the owls, nearly 40% is already protected from or unsuitable
for logging. As for the old-growth forests of 100-year-old
Douglas fir, spruce and hemlock, at least 900,000 acres are
already protected wilderness and can't be logged.
   We just don't see that the environmental lobby should be
accorded the moral high ground on this one. The land area at
issue here is huge. If this nation's land laws, its courts,
its federal agencies and Congress have arrived at the point
that Americans have to leave their jobs and homes on behalf
of 3,000 owls, then the political system is not functioning
as it was intended to.

   Dial-a-Cardiologist
   From Remote Hospitals

   SMALL HOSPITALS soon may be able to bring distant
cardiologists to patients' bedsides instantly -- with a
computer and a phone.
   Such facilities often don't have a cardiologist who can
examine patients' hearts on video screens attached to
ultrasound machines, interpreting the subtle signs that can
tell whether chest pains call for emergency bypass surgery or
for Alka-Seltzer. Doctors at small hospitals must mail the
videotapes to big-city heart specialists for detailed
diagnoses, a process that can take days.
   Claritek Corp., a San Diego start-up, has developed a
computer system called HeartLink that sends live images of a
beating heart over a phone line to a specialist's computer
screen, circumventing the problem that ordinary video signals
are too big to fit into phone lines. Claritek's system uses
copyrighted mathematical algorithms in an encoder device that
takes a heart's image from the ultrasound machine and
translates critical heart movements -- such as a valve's
opening and closing -- into digital codes that fit into phone
lines.
   A decoder in the heart specialist's personal computer at
the other end of the phone translates the code into a color
image of a heart. The computer-generated heart precisely
mimics the patient's heart, allowing the cardiologist to
diagnose problems and give prescriptions as if the patient
were in the same room.
   Claritek, whose developers include a TRW Inc.
mathematician and a Hollywood cartoon animator, has installed
a pilot HeartLink system at the University of California, San
Diego, where cardiologists say early results are promising.
It plans to place other machines, which it expects to sell
eventually for $350,000 to $700,000, in California, Kentucky,
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts university hospitals.
                                                                                                       

   Video Standards Grow
   Passe Before They Exist
                                                                                                       

   MULTIMEDIA proponents, who want to conduct video
conferences over phone lines and send movies into PCs, are
waiting for standards-setting groups to agree on common ways
to compress those video images so they fit on such equipment.
   But standards are having trouble keeping up with
technology. The world telecommunications body, CCITT, for
example, is expected to adopt this year a standard formula to
compress video images into phone lines for teleconferences
and TV phones. But, says an executive at video-conference
equipment vendor PictureTel Corp., the standard already "is a
few generations behind the latest technology."
   The CCITT standard needs the equivalent of about four
phone lines to transmit images that don't blur if a conferee
moves his head or gestures, PictureTel says. The company
sells equipment using new compression algorithms that give
equal quality over two phone lines -- and soon will work on
one phone line. Because the CCITT standard is already
obsolete, the company says, it was forced to turn to its own
proprietary algorithms, which aren't able to talk to other
vendors' equipment cheaply.
   Similarly, the International Standards Organization is
mulling standards for PCs to process moving pictures, but the
standards aren't expected out until 1991 or later. Intel
Corp. couldn't wait, and last year introduced a set of chips
using a proprietary way to compress video images. Intel's
chips can be programmed later to conform to standards.
                                                                                                       

   Speeding Flow of Data
   With Indium Phosphide
                                                                                                       

   THERE'S ALWAYS a greed for speed among companies that
transmit information, whether it's over wires, airwaves or
satellites. Cable-TV concerns, for instance, will need faster
transmission speeds to send high-definition television
channels on fiber-optic cables.
   The solution could come from a chip material called indium
phosphide, which is far faster than older materials and
creates half the electronic "noise." The latest development
comes from Varian Associates Inc., which built an
indium-phosphide chip with seven transistors that turns on
and off 100 billion times a second. At that rate, the chip
will transmit and receive more than 50 times as much
information through optical fibers as today's silicon chips,
which typically oscillate at fewer than two billion cycles a
second.
   The Varian chip uses high-electron-mobility-transistor
technology (HEMT), which speeds up electrons by clearing
impurities out of their paths. Varian says the chips can be
made with standard chip-making equipment and could be on the
market in two years.
   General Electric Co. expects indium-phosphide HEMTs to be
used in direct-broadcast satellite systems that beam TV
signals down to plate-sized home satellite dishes. General
Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft Co. unit, which built an
indium-phosphide transistor that oscillates 250 billion times
a second, expects auto companies to use the devices in
collision-avoidance radar. TRW is developing such chips for
"smart" weapons, such as missiles that use millimeter-wave
radar to look through fog and recognize a target's shape.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   THE KEY to cheap chips is in squeezing more circuits onto
them. The average microprocessor chip unveiled at a recent
international chip conference contained 580,000 transistors,
up from 150,000 at 1987's conference. . . . Don't toss that
slow, aging fax machine: Electronic Modules Inc. has a new
$499 device that lets an old fax machine scan documents, but
takes over the task of transmitting the image, sending a fax
at speeds rivaling today's fastest machines.

   BANK OF NEW ENGLAND (Boston) -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. lowered ratings on about $750 million of long-term debt,
subordinated debt and preferred stock. The rating agency said
Bank of New England's increase in problem loans during the
first quarter has "raised greater uncertainty regarding the
viability of the institution." Moody's lowered Bank of New
England's senior debt to Caa from B3, its senior subordinated
debt to Ca from Caa, its shelf registration for senior debt
to (P)Caa from (P)B3 and its preferred stock to `ca' from
`caa.' Moody's confirmed the "not prime" rating for
commercial paper. Moody's also confirmed the ratings of Bank
of New England's subsidiary banks for deposit obligations,
based on its view that depositors would receive
"substantially better" regulatory protection than holding
company creditors. Bank of New England N.A. and Connecticut
Bank &amp; Trust remain rated at Ba3 for long-term deposits and
"not prime" for short-term deposits. The banks' obligations
backed by letters of credit remain at Caa.

   Even without a major rate move, traders still expect rates
to be yanked around from day to day by rumors and events in
Japan and Europe. In Mr. Robertson's view, the yield on the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond could vacillate between 8
3/4% and 8 1/4%.
   He and other economists base their forecasts largely on
the Labor Department's March employment data released Friday.
Bond market players view the jobs data as the most important
of the government's monthly indicators because they are
timely and sometimes help determine the Federal Reserve's
next move on interest rates.
   Reports on such topics as foreign trade and orders for
big-ticket merchandise are released more than a month after
the reporting period ends. But the jobs data emerge the first
Friday of every month, for the prior month. Last spring and
summer when the Fed was slowly pushing interest rates lower,
its moves often occurred shortly after the employment data
were released.
   Friday's report was considered especially crucial because
it was supposed to show if the big employment gains of
332,000 in January and 356,000 in February were aberrations
or a harbinger of strong economic growth. The latter
possibility worried bondholders. They feared it could lead to
higher inflation, prompting the Fed to raise interest rates.
Both trends would hurt bond prices.
   But Friday's employment report didn't clarify things. The
number of non-farm jobs expanded by just 26,000 last month,
the smallest advance in nearly four years, suggesting that
the economy isn't gathering strength. Yet the unemployment
rate eased to 5.2% in March from 5.3% in February, meaning
that the economy isn't sitting still, either.
   "You can't make a strong argument one way or the other
because the employment data was a real mixed bag," said Louis
Crandall, economist at W.R. Wrightson &amp; Co.
   With no clear trend apparent, economist Maria Fiorini
Ramirez believes "there is no reason for the Fed to change
policy," and the closely watched federal funds rate will stay
at its current level of 8 1/4%. Federal funds, which the Fed
uses to signal changes in credit policy, is the rate that
banks charge each other for overnight loans.
   Ms. Ramirez, president of Maria Ramirez Capital
Consultants Inc., said the economy is growing at a relatively
healthy pace but growth is "neither decelerating nor
re-accelerating."
   In the coming weeks, the bond market is likely to take its
cues from developments in the foreign-exchange market and the
Japanese financial markets. The biggest worry is that the
steep decline in the Tokyo stock market, which has dropped
nearly 30% so far this year, could continue and put pressure
on Japanese investors to sell U.S. Treasury bonds to raise
cash.
   "People are very afraid of a Japanese liquidation of
Treasury bonds," said Jay Goldinger, a trader and investment
strategist at Capital Insight, Beverly Hills, Calif.
"Everybody is somewhat fearful that Treasury bonds will go
down like gold," he said. Mr. Goldinger was referring to the
March 26 sell-off that resulted in gold prices plunging $20
an ounce in one day. The gold rout was triggered by reports
that the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority sold two million
ounces of gold in London. "If it can happen in gold, there is
a fear that it can happen in bonds."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bond prices ended little changed after a roller
coaster ride that was sparked by a smaller-than-expected gain
in March payrolls and other reports.
   "Trading was really kind of schizophrenic," said Charles
Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover
Securities Corp. Bond prices initially rose as much as 3/4
point, or $7.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount, in
reaction to the small rise in employment growth. But soon
after the early buying spree the market abruptly switched
gears, with bond prices giving up their gain and heading down
as much as 3/8 point before edging back up to finish little
changed.
   Among the rumors whipping the market Friday was talk that
a large Japanese institution had sold $1 billion of 30-year
bonds. The market was also disturbed by news that an official
of West Germany's central bank had said interest rates would
have to rise again if the two Germanys decided on a
one-to-one exchange rate for their two currencies.
   Bond prices were further hurt by a wire service's report,
which cited an unnamed Federal Reserve official as saying the
lower civilian unemployment rate was raising concern about
inflation. The March unemployment rate dipped to 5.2% from
5.3% in February.
   By the end of trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was
unchanged from Thursday at a price of 99 23/32 to yield
8.51%. The latest 10-year notes were at 99 19/32 to yield
8.54% compared with 99 17/32 to yield 8.55%. Short-term rates
were little changed.
   The government will auction $3.5 billion of 40-year bonds
for the Resolution Funding Corp. tomorrow and will sell $7.5
billion of seven-year notes Wednesday. In when-issued trading
Friday, the 40-year Refcorp bonds were yielding 8.83% and the
seven-year notes 8.59%.
   In the corporate market, a $500 million offering by
PepsiCo Inc. capped a heavy week of offerings that saw more
than $3 billion of new debt sold.
   Junk bonds of Eckerd Holdings plummeted more than seven
points on rumors that Jack Eckerd Corp. plans to acquire some
Revco D.S. Inc. assets. By comparison, most other junk bonds
or speculative-grade bonds with low credit ratings or none at
all lost 1/4 to 3/8 point while high-grade bonds were little
changed.
   Eckerd officials couldn't be reached to comment on the
rumors, which also included speculation that the company is
in the private market with a bond issue that will be senior
to its securities outstanding. Eckerd Holdings' 11 1/8%
subordinated debentures, maturing in 2001, fell six points to
74.
   The company's zero-coupon securities ended at 65, down 7
1/2 points from Thursday's closing price. A spokeswoman for
Anac Holding Corp., the parent of Revco, confirmed that the
company has been talking with potential buyers for the
purchase of 712 drugstores. The spokeswoman declined to say
whether the company was in discussions with Jack Eckerd Corp.

   UAL Chief Wolf, Bypassed in Latest Bid,
   Missed Opportunities, Alienated Unions

   Six months ago, Stephen M. Wolf was flying high.
   The chairman and chief executive officer of UAL Corp. had
just secured an arrangement that would make him part owner of
the nation's second-largest airline -- and very wealthy as
well. His stock options had soared in value to $76 million
when UAL directors agreed to sell the company to a group led
by Mr. Wolf and United Airlines' pilots union.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But since that bid suddenly collapsed last Oct. 13,
prospects have gone from bad to worse for the man who once
was a darling of Wall Street. His crash landing came Friday
with the UAL board's acceptance of a new offer from United's
three unions -- one without Mr. Wolf. Though there still may
be a long-shot chance of a comeback, it's likely the
48-year-old Mr. Wolf will lose his job.
   Mr. Wolf's slide has been one of the surprising features
of the UAL saga. The airline executive, an intensely private
person, won't talk about the events of the past several
months. But others close to the lengthy UAL negotiations,
including some of Mr. Wolf's allies, say that his personal
style served to exacerbate his troubles.
   According to the portrait they paint, Mr. Wolf squandered
opportunities and alienated all three of the airline's
unions.
   When the labor-management bid collapsed last October, the
pilot union had expected Mr. Wolf to take the lead in
reviving the buy-out effort. A few days after the collapse,
Frederick C. Dubinsky, the pilot-union chairman, conferred
with Mr. Wolf. He found Mr. Wolf subdued.
   Mr. Wolf then "essentially went into hiding," Mr. Dubinsky
says.
   The pilot union's advisers, meanwhile, forged ahead on a
new bid of $220 to $240 a share to replace the failed
$300-a-share proposal. At least the sharp drop in UAL's stock
price, they told the pilots, meant the unions wouldn't have
to provide as many concessions.
   But UAL management had other ideas. On Dec. 4, the pilots'
advisers traveled to UAL director Ralph Strangis's law
offices in Minneapolis. Mr. Wolf had asked Mr. Strangis, a
longtime friend, to present management's new buy-out
proposal. In exchange for his participation, Mr. Wolf still
wanted the pilots to make the same $200 million in
concessions they had before.
   "We said this is preposterous," recalls pilot attorney
Stuart Oran. "The objective of the union wasn't to provide
concessions for the sake of it, but to provide adequate
concessions to finance a deal." When the advisers told Mr.
Dubinsky the details of the management proposal, he was
livid. After that meeting, the pilots began intense talks
with the International Association of Machinists, whose
opposition had helped torpedo the earlier bid. "We knew we
either needed the IAM or Wolf" to put together a new offer,
Mr. Dubinsky says. But the machinists, still smarting over
previous battles with Mr. Wolf, had one condition: Mr. Wolf
and senior management couldn't be a part of the plan.
   Meanwhile, Coniston Partners, UAL's largest shareholder,
was threatening to oust the board in a proxy fight if
directors didn't sell or refinance the company. The UAL board
was growing weary with Mr. Wolf's failure to put together a
new bid with the pilot union.
   In early January, an executive committee of UAL's outside
directors met. Longtime directors Frank A. Olson, chairman of
Hertz Corp. and former UAL chairman, and John F.
McGillicuddy, chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., were
particularly critical of Mr. Wolf. The committee gave Mr.
Wolf a one-week deadline to show progress.
   But when the deadline passed with little progress, the
board placed in charge one of its lawyers, Lewis Kaden of
Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell, and investment banker Michael Goldberg
of First Boston Corp.
   Progress then came swiftly. At a board meeting Jan. 25,
Mr. Kaden announced all three of United's unions -- the
pilots, machinists and flight attendants -- had agreed to
work on a new buy-out effort.
   Mr. Wolf, who had appeared sullen at the meeting, then
began a behind-the-scenes effort to block the unions' bid. A
turning point came Feb. 21, when Mr. Wolf had a private
dinner meeting with the board. The next day, directors told
their advisers to stop trying to negotiate a buy-out with the
unions.
   Nevertheless, on March 19, the unions announced an offer
valued at $185 a share, or about $4 billion. The kicker was
that they had teamed up with Coniston to try and oust the
board at UAL's April 26 annual shareholders meeting.
   With the deadline looming for the start of the proxy
battle, UAL's board was pressed to make a decision.
Throughout a 21-hour board meeting that began last Thursday
and ended 6 a.m. CDT Friday, Mr. Wolf unsuccessfully tried to
block an agreement by placing a number of conditions on the
deal, people familiar with the talks said.
   Apparently convinced of the inevitable, Mr. Wolf voted for
the agreement in principle to permit the employee buy-out.

   BRIGHTON, England -- John Hider has spent more than 20
years sweeping streets in this busy seaside town, but now he
has a new cleaning cart and new boss -- both from Madrid.
   Fomento de Obras &amp; Construcciones S.A., known as Focsa,
undercut the homegrown bids and in January took over
Brighton's street-cleaning. "It was a surprise," says Mr.
Hider, who never imagined foreigners would move in to tidy up
Brighton's much-visited parks and piers. But soon the novelty
wore off. "As long as I get a week's money, it doesn't matter
who pays me," he says with a shrug.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Eventually, deals like Focsa's won't cause even a
short-lived stir, European Community officials say. To hasten
that day, the EC Commission has reignited its campaign to pry
open the public procurement practices of its 12 member
countries, where big government contracts have long been
viewed as subtle subsidies for national companies.
   The stakes are enormous: Assuming the EC push succeeds,
companies will be able to reach across borders to compete for
some $700 billion in yearly contracts from governments and
regulated utilities. "If we had our druthers, we'd druther
see this than anything" connected with the 1992 program, says
George Hall, who watches EC affairs for STC PLC, the British
telecommunications and technology concern.
   Though government procurement is probably the biggest
prize of the 1992 single market plan, it's also Europe's most
protected trove. Until recently, only rarely did a major
contract go to a company from the wrong side of a border.
Cynics doubt there will be much of a change. Despite years of
EC pushing for cross-border competition for government jobs,
civil servants -- out of habit or bias -- still ladle out big
contracts to national favorites, the skeptics say.
   But the mentality seems to be shifting, slowly but surely.
"This nationalism will erode," says J.A. Kay, a professor at
the London Business School. "Most countries are working to
have a less-political management of their industries." The EC
as well is demanding tougher rules on government procurement
and has beefed-up an enforcement team that aims to crack down
on contracting authorities who continue protectionist ways.
   Increasingly, companies are seeking -- and winning -- jobs
away from home. "It's already on the move," says John
Clement, who oversees contracts for Krinkels Beplantings
Maatschappij, a Dutch construction and maintenance company.
"We're doing more in Belgium, West Germany and the U.K."
   But the increase in cross-border contracting stems as much
from corporate restructuring as from rule-making in Brussels.
The past few years have seen a proliferation of cross-border
mergers and joint ventures, both of which tend to scramble
national identities. As a result, government contracting
officers are getting used to working with companies based in
other countries.
   Some concerns even hit pay dirt in the foreign capitals
themselves. Earlier this year, International Computers Ltd.,
a subsidiary of Britain's STC, won a contract to supply the
West German Bundestag with personal computers. Parliament
members in Bonn were won over by the computers' capabilities
and International Computers' promise of good service,
officials involved in the negotiations said.
   U.S. business, meanwhile, is nervous that while
procurement contracts open up within the EC, they'll become
more closed to U.S. bidders. The fears are based on more than
the U.S.'s phobia about Fortress Europe. Last month, EC
ministers agreed to open up government contracts in
telecommunications, energy, transport and water industries,
but they also adopted a "Buy Europe" provision that would
allow procurement officials to throw out bids involving less
than 50% EC content.
   "The Buy-Europe provision wasn't considered a friendly
gesture," says Harry Freeman, who lobbies for a number of
U.S. companies who are pushing for more open trade around the
world. "Things were going fine with 1992 until this
procurement package came along." He and others plan to fight
the controversial amendment at trade talks in progress at the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Meanwhile, Europeans say the cross-border competition
isn't embraced with equal enthusiasm throughout the EC.
Complaints about the French abound. "France makes my blood
pressure go up, because it practices blatant protectionism,"
complains Harry Moss, chief executive officer of the U.K.'s
Audioline Ltd., which makes telephones, answering machines
and security systems.
   Britain stands out as one of the most open EC countries,
partly because the Thatcher government has pushed through
legislation requiring procurement authorities to choose low
bidders, no matter where they come from. British officials
don't miss the irony: The U.K., often considered a
recalcitrant EC member, boasts a comparatively open
public-contracting policy, while France, enthusiastic about a
united EC, has a reputation for hoarding government jobs.
   As a hedge against continuing nationalism, companies are
seeking cross-border acquisitions and investments that make
them seem less foreign to procurement officers. "In France,
you take a French disguise," says one company executive
chasing government contracts there.
   Typical is the strategy of West Germany's Holtzman AG.
Last year, in a campaign to win more business in Spain,
Holtzman bought a 50% stake in Jotsa S.A., a construction
company based in Madrid, and entered a cooperation agreement
with Agroman S.A., another construction company.
   The investments and linkups are helping to change the
mind-set of Western Europe's procurement officers. Coleman
Morrissey, materials manager for the Electricity Supply Board
in the Republic of Ireland, says that in recent waves of
acquisitions, many of Europe's cable and transformer
suppliers have been swallowed up by ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG,
the Swedish-Swiss conglomerate, or by Pirelli S.p.A. of
Milan. Procurement officers increasingly expect bidders of
any nationality, he says.
   Spain's Focsa, which didn't link up with a local company
in its move into Britain, concedes it has had to make some
awkward adjustments. The first week Focsa was on the job,
winter gale winds, particularly brutal in Brighton, upended
several street-cleaning buggies that generally traveled
smoothly on sunny Spanish streets.
   Greater turbulence hit when Focsa tried to reassign a
number of elderly women to street-sweeping duties after years
of cleaning public toilets. Though women are well-represented
on street crews in Spain, the Brighton ladies considered the
switch an insulting comedown. After strenuous protests and
many letters to the local newspaper, Focsa dropped the plan,
and the women have returned to their previous assignments.
Meanwhile, the company has yet to recognize the local union,
sparking small strikes and picketing.
   Notwithstanding the frictions in Brighton, Focsa has
landed a street-cleaning contract in Stockport, and officials
expect three or four more in coming months.

   But Delay in Baseball Season
   Complicates the Task;
   Toronto's Passover Woes

   NEW YORK -- If it hadn't been for professional baseball's
32-day lockout, pious Jewish fans of the Toronto Blue Jays
wouldn't have been in such a tizzy.
   The Blue Jays had been scheduled for an off-day today. But
the week-long delay in the baseball season's opening has sent
them to Arlington to play the Texas Rangers tonight. Both
teams would then fly to Toronto for what was rescheduled as
an afternoon game tomorrow.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But that would violate a players' association rule: No
team can play a day game on the day after a night game if
that would require an airplane flight of more than 90
minutes.
   So tomorrow's game was again rescheduled, for tomorrow
night -- when many Jewish ticketholders will be observing the
Seder, or Passover supper, at home. In a four-day period, the
Blue Jays got 150 telephone calls complaining of the
conflict. "It's caused quite a stir here," says Gary Oswald,
a spokesman for the team.
   The Blue Jays have decided to offer refunds to the
frustrated ticketholders, but that isn't the end of their
scheduling woes. Another rescheduled game with the Rangers is
set now for Aug. 6. That, however, would mean games on 21
successive days for the Blue Jays, and the players'
association rules require a day off after 20. In this case,
the association is being asked to waive the rule.
   Multiply such problems by the major leagues' 26 teams,
each of which can gain a financial edge in advantageous
scheduling, and you get an idea why baseball scheduling is
too complicated to trust to computers.
   The job largely falls instead on a soft-spoken,
publicity-shy married couple on New York's Staten Island,
Henry and Holly Stephenson. Few fans have heard of them, and
the Stephensons would just as soon keep it that way; they
have troubles enough satisfying people like George
Steinbrenner. The Stephensons only reluctantly discuss their
job with an outsider.
   Their firm, Stephenson Systems Co., spends about eight
months a year scheduling 2,106 baseball games under a
contract with Major League Baseball, a league organization
headed by the commissioner. Nobody involved will say how much
the contract is worth, except that it is less than $1 million
a year.
   Scheduling a season is tough enough. Changing a single
game is something like pulling an orange from the bottom of a
neatly stacked pile in a grocery.
   In 1987, the Montreal Expos were to play in a new stadium,
but nobody knew whether it would be finished in time for the
opener. So the Stephensons put Montreal on the road for the
first two weeks, confounding the schedules of at least three
other National League East teams.
   One was the Pittsburgh Pirates. They usually enjoy a
preponderance of home games in June, when warm weather draws
larger crowds. The revised schedule meant more home games in
chilly April. "It severely hurt our attendance," says Bernie
Mullin, a Pirate executive. "The schedule can make a
tremendous difference" in attendance and revenue.
   The Stephensons try not to resort to doubleheaders to make
up for lost days. Owners dislike them because they generate
less revenue than two single games. This year's season delay
will mean more doubleheaders than usual, though.
   Mr. Steinbrenner, principal owner of the New York Yankees,
has groused for years about American League scheduling. The
Yanks draw bigger home crowds against old rivals like Boston
and Baltimore, especially in the summer, than when they play
some newer teams. "I don't like the way scheduling has been
done, and not many are completely satisfied," says Mr.
Steinbrenner, though he concedes the Yankees are getting a
fair shake in heavy-drawing home games this summer.
   In the American League, after the Stephensons turn in
their draft schedule, most of the complaints from
dissatisfied teams come to the league's scheduling committee.
Dick Wagner, a special assistant in Major League Baseball,
was fielding calls in his office last month, when the first
week of the regular season still had to be rescheduled. "I'm
not Houdini, chief," he told one caller. "I'm sorry to do
this to you, but everybody's going to be hurt."
   Long before opening day, questionnaires sent to the major
league teams give them a chance to make special requests.
   The Expos and the Toronto Blue Jays always want to play in
the U.S. on July Fourth, but not on July 1, which is Canada
Day. The Boston Red Sox have always played at home on
Patriots' Day in Massachusetts. The Minnesota Twins always
want to be away on the third weekend of May. Might as well
be; it's the opening day of wall-eye season.
   In New York, the Mets want to be home when the Yankees are
away, and the Yankees want to be home when the Mets are away.
The same is true for the other two-team places, Chicago, San
Francisco-Oakland, and Los Angeles-Anaheim. "They don't
always get what they want," Mrs. Stephenson says.
   In 1984, the Texas Rangers asked to be home when the
Republican convention kicked off in Dallas, to attract
convention-goers. But in San Francisco, site of the
Democratic convention, the Giants asked to be put on the
road, partly to avoid congestion. Also, the All-Star game
would be played in San Francisco the preceding week, making
the Giants games that would follow seem anticlimactic. Both
teams got what they wanted.
   In many stadiums, baseball isn't the only thing going on.
There are also rock concerts, trade shows and professional
football. The conflicts keep cropping up to make things tough
for the schedulers. That often means they have to do another
version of the schedule. "We did up to 14 in one year," Mrs.
Stephenson says.
   The Stephensons were living in Greenwich Village and
writing software as New York City employees in the 1970s when
by chance they met George Faust Sr., father of a friend. Mr.
Faust, then director of broadcasting for the National
Basketball Association, mentioned that the NBA was having a
hard time finding somebody to program its schedule on a
computer. It was then being done entirely by hand by
80-year-old Steve Gottlieb, who was preparing to retire.
   A year later, the Stephensons, who yearned to start their
own business, volunteered for the job. They soon learned
there was no way to do a schedule entirely by computer.
   In 1981 they were offered the Major League Baseball
contract. They also scheduled the now-defunct North American
Soccer League and still do the Major Indoor Soccer League.
The NBA now does its own scheduling, though.
   From the time the Stephensons start the schedule in
December until they turn in a rough draft a few months later,
they are always working a season ahead. The next four months,
they work with league scheduling committees to review and
revise.
   Teams that get bad breaks one season usually get favored
treatment the next. The Stephensons and the committees stick
to the system they know best, a mixture of pencil and paper
and computer, arranging blocks of games in repeating patterns
and then resolving the inevitable conflicts with owner
demands, players-association rules and competing events.
   So far as the Stephensons are concerned, the 1990 season
is ancient history now. They're busy working on 1991.

   PARIS -- The Group of Seven industrial countries said the
yen's recent decline has "undesirable consequences" for world
economic adjustment, but brushed aside Japanese calls for
coordinated interest-rate actions to support the shaky
currency.
   The group, which includes the finance ministers and
central bank governors of the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada, also agreed to keep
financial market developments, especially the yen's decline,
"under review."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a joint statement released after their one-day meeting
here Saturday, members of the world's most powerful economic
club implied that they might continue intervening in the
foreign-exchange markets to try to counter weakness in the
yen. The participants reaffirmed their commitment to economic
policy coordination, including "cooperation in exchange
markets," the statement said.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, in a briefing with
reporters after the G-7 meeting, highlighted the negative
effect of the yen's decline on the U.S. trade deficit with
Japan, which totaled $49 billion in 1989. "There's more
burden on that than there was before," he said. A falling yen
makes Japanese goods cheaper for U.S. and other foreign
buyers.
   "There's no question we aren't happy with what has
happened with the yen," said Canadian Finance Minister
Michael Wilson.
   Japan has been pressing for coordinated international
interest-rate moves -- and particularly cuts in U.S. and West
German interest rates  -- to help the Japanese stabilize the
weakening yen. Such moves would reduce the attraction of the
dollar and the mark and hence help shore up the Japanese
currency. But the U.S. and Germany are reluctant to take such
steps, fearing they might boost inflation while economic
growth remains relatively strong.
   In Tokyo Monday morning, the dollar opened sharply lower,
sinking quickly toward 155 yen to the dollar. Market
participants said traders were responding to Japanese
newspapers' optimistic coverage of the Paris meeting.
   At the close of the morning session, the dollar finished
at 156.70 yen, compared with 157.65 yen at New York's Friday
close, and the stock market posted solid gains, with the
Nikkei index at 30165.45, up 886.67 points, or 3%, from
Friday's close.
   A report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest
business daily, said the G-7 countries were expected to sell
their own currencies and buy yen in an effort to support the
yen. It wasn't immediately clear whether such actions would
occur. At midmorning, Bank of Japan was reported to be
intervening in the market but in small amounts intended to
smooth out some of the sharp early swings in trading.
   The G-7 meeting, which was primarily held to survey world
economic developments, also included discussion of a
projected capital increase for the International Monetary
Fund; developments in Eastern Europe; and Germany's expected
economic and monetary union, which the group's statement said
"could contribute to improved global growth and to a
reduction of external imbalances in Europe."
   That endorsement, sought by the West Germans, was given
following a "commitment made by the Germans" to try to avoid
increased interest rates as a result of its monetary union,
French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said after the
meeting. He added that he hoped the process of German
economic unification would recycle West German surpluses in
Europe.
   In the coming unification of the East and West German
currencies, the West Germans will effectively be subsidizing
the exchange rate. This would mean a potentially inflationary
one-time change in the stock of West German money.
   Commenting generally on the G-7 gathering, Treasury
Secretary Brady said, "we moved the consensus forward" on a
range of issues, including IMF matters, Eastern Europe and
the need to boost savings. "We have around the world --
though particularly in the U.S. -- a shortage of savings," he
said. But the group didn't detail how savings should be
boosted.
   The recent weakness of the yen, however, has been the
matter of most immediate concern to the G-7 countries. It has
declined about 10% this year against the dollar, and already
forced Japan to raise its discount rate to 5.25% from 4.25%.
The discount rate is a benchmark rate at which the central
bank extends funds to financial institutions.
   The move in Japan's discount rate came despite a rout in
the Japanese stock market, where the Nikkei index of major
stocks has fallen more than 20% this year. Many analysts
expect that Japan soon may have to raise interest rates again
in the event of continued yen weakness.
   While they had hoped for more explicit assistance, the
Japanese tried to put a brave face on the outcome of the G-7
meeting. The wording of the group's statement "is very
strong," Makoto Utsumi, the Japanese Finance Ministry's vice
minister for international affairs, said in an interview. "It
is the first time to single out the yen" he added, alluding
to the group's unprecedented attention to his country's
currency.
   In recent days, the U.S. and other G-7 nations have
emphasized that Japan is responsible for stabilizing its
financial markets. "It's up to the Japanese to keep these
developments under close surveillance. The situation should
become more stable," France's Mr. Beregovoy said after the
meeting.
   The Japanese would seem to have been in a strong
bargaining position over the weekend. Only last Thursday,
they agreed to lower a variety of trade barriers, steps that
could open their economy to goods and services from abroad.
Although the U.S. agreed to make some concessions to the
Japanese, the accord may have given more to the U.S. than to
Japan.
   Yet, despite making those concessions at the trade
bargaining table, the Japanese failed to win much of
substance at the G-7 table. In fact, officials of the
Treasury and the State Department denied that anyone even
tried to make any trade-offs between the two sets of talks.
   The G-7, which generally gathers about three times a year,
probably will have another chance to review Japan's situation
soon. Canada's Mr. Wilson said they may well reconvene before
the IMF's policymaking interim committee holds its midyear
meeting in early May in Washington.
   Mr. Wilson, who chairs the powerful interim committee,
said the Paris meeting hadn't reached a consensus on the size
of the IMF's projected increase in capital. "I think we're
getting close to a consensus (of an increase) in the range of
50% to two-thirds -- and closer to the lower end of that
range," he said. The IMF currently has capital of about $120
billion.
   There was, however, no mention of the IMF in the G-7
statement, and the group is sensitive to charges that it may
be deciding IMF matters outside the appropriate forum. "It
isn't up to us to decide," said Mr. Beregovoy. "We are moving
toward an increase in resources, but the interim committee
will decide."

   General Motors Corp.'s Canadian unit said it reduced
prices on most 1991 models of its sporty Chevrolet Camaro and
Pontiac Firebird, which went on sale in Canada last week.
   The new Firebird price policy differs from that in the
U.S., where the parent company last month raised the 1991
price of a standard, six-cylinder Firebird by 6% from the
1990 model, to $11,985.

   General Motors of Canada Ltd., based in Oshawa, Ontario,

with automatic transmission was reduced to 16,898 Canadian
dollars (UA$14,460) from C$17,805 for the 1990 model. The
price of a similarly equipped Camaro RS was reduced to
C$16,398 Canadian dollars from C$17,805.

   Jury Selection Begins in California
   For McMartin Preschool Retrial

   Jury selection begins today in the child-molestation
retrial of Raymond Buckey, the former California preschool
teacher whose first criminal trial was the longest and
costliest in U.S. history.
   Mr. Buckey, who was indicted in March 1984, will be tried
on eight counts of child molestation involving three girls
who were once pupils at the now-defunct Virginia McMartin
Preschool in the upscale California community of Manhattan
Beach.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earlier this year, after nearly three months of
deliberations in the 28-month trial, a jury in Los Angeles
Superior Court acquitted Mr. Buckey and his 63-year-old
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 out of 65 counts of
child molestation. But Mr. Buckey's victory was cut short by
the prosecution's decision to retry the remaining 13 counts
on which the jurors had become hopelessly deadlocked. Since
then five of the unresolved counts have been dismissed.
   The Los Angeles district attorney alleged that from 1978
to 1983, Mr. Buckey, the grandson of the school's founder,
and Mrs. Buckey, the school's director, molested 11
youngsters at the once-prestigious school. The children also
accused their former teachers of a litany of horrific
misdeeds including satanic rituals, child-pornography rings
and animal mutilations.
   Mr. Buckey, 31, has steadfastly proclaimed his innocence.
His lawyer, Danny Davis, has argued that the case grew out of
mass hysteria resembling the Salem witch hunts of 1692. If
convicted, Mr. Buckey, who has spent nearly five years in
prison, faces a maximum 15-year prison term. A representative
of the Los Angeles district attorney said time served would
likely be subtracted as time and a half.
   Jury selection is expected to take at least a month
because of the difficulty of finding individuals who aren't
opinionated about the case. The trial is expected to take at
least six months.

   IMELDA MARCOS ASKS JUDGE to lift her bail restrictions.
   Benjamin Cassiday, an attorney for Mrs. Marcos, told U.S.
Judge John Keenan that she wants to return to the Philippines
for the deposition of defense witnesses.
   He also said he will seek a deposition from Corazon
Aquino, who became president of the Philippines in early 1986
after Mrs. Marcos's husband, the late Ferdinand Marcos, was
ousted from power. The deposition is necessary, the lawyer
stated in an affidavit, to authenticate a taped radio
broadcast in which Mrs. Aquino said she directed the former
U.S. ambassador to the Philippines to remove the Marcoses
from that country.
   Mrs. Marcos, whose trial began last month, is charged with
stealing more than $160 million from the Philippines and
concealing most of the money through real-estate purchases in
the U.S. She has sought to have her trial in federal court in
New York thrown out on the grounds that she was brought to
the U.S. against her will during the revolution that brought
President Aquino to power. Judge Keenan previously rejected
that claim. Federal prosecutors say Mrs. Marcos came to the
U.S. voluntarily.
   In his affidavit, Mr. Cassiday, who was in the Philippines
last month, said a "general atmosphere of intimidation in the
Philippines" makes it impossible for many potential defense
witnesses to come to the U.S. to testify. "Every witness that
I interviewed demonstrated . . . that he or she was
intimidated by the combined power of the Aquino
administration in the Philippines and the U.S. government,"
he said in the affidavit. "As a result of this pervasive fear
it was necessary for me to change hotel rooms repeatedly so
that witnesses that I interviewed couldn't be identified by
Filipino government agents."
   Potential witnesses say they believe they may be jailed by
the U.S. or that the Aquino administration won't permit them
to return home if they come to the U.S. to testify, Mr.
Cassiday wrote.

   WINDMERE WINS $30 million judgment from N.V. Philips.
   After a six-year battle, Windmere Corp. won the judgment,
which will be trebled, in antitrust litigation involving
Philip's Norelco shavers. The award was made Friday in U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
   In 1984, Dutch-based Philips and its North American
Philips Corp. unit sued Windmere, a personal-care-products
maker in Miami Lakes, Fla., and one of its suppliers. Philips
alleged unfair competition and patent infringement related to
Windmere's rotary electric shaver.
   Windmere filed a counterclaim alleging that Philips drove
it out of the three-head rotary-shaver market by offering 35%
to 40% discounts on old models of its Norelco shaver,
underselling Windmere by 25% to 30%. Windmere, represented by
the Chicago law firm of Winston &amp; Strawn, said it suffered
damages of between $13 million and $39 million and abandoned
the market as a result. U.S. officials of Philips and lawyers
at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, the New York law firm representing
the company, couldn't be reached for comment.
   Upon hearing the verdict, David M. Friedson, Windmere
president and chief executive officer, sent employees home
early Friday afternoon.

   ARBITRAGERS CONVICTED of insider-trading charges.
   A federal jury in New York convicted Wall Street
arbitrager Victor Teicher and Ross Frankel, former head of
arbitrage research at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The two
were implicated in the "Yuppie Five" case in 1986 in which
five young Wall Street professionals were charged with
trading on inside information about corporate-takeover plans.
   Mr. Teicher, 38, and his securities firm, Victor Teicher &amp;
Co., were convicted of one count of conspiracy and eleven
counts of securities fraud. Mr. Teicher also was convicted of
two counts of mail fraud.
   Mr. Frankel, 33, was convicted of one count of conspiracy,
one count of securities fraud, one count of mail fraud, one
count of perjury and two counts of obstruction of justice.
   Lawyers for the defendants said they would appeal.
   The defendants each face maximum fines of $250,000 on each
count and substantial prison sentences. The Teicher firm
could be fined a maximum of $500,000 on each count.
   The trial was the second half of a case that also included
as defendants Marcus Schloss &amp; Co. and Ronald Yagoda,
formerly head of the arbitrage-trading room at Marcus
Schloss. In July, the New York arbitrage firm was convicted
of two insider-trading related charges and Mr. Yagoda was
acquitted.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission last week settled
its civil charges against Mr. Yagoda. That settlement
includes an unusual provision for Mr. Yagoda, who didn't
admit any wrongdoing: After a one-year suspension from the
securities industry, he will have to keep a log for three
years recording all communications he has about any companies
in which he trades or causes trading.
   The log will be available to the SEC for review.

   One of the feuding siblings battling for control of the
Gallimard publishing house gave up the fight Friday and
announced she will sell her shares to a bank.
   Isabelle Gallimard, 39, will give up nearly her entire
12.5% stake in the family business to Banque Nationale de
Paris (BNP) for an undisclosed price, according to a
statement.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move leaves her sister Francoise, 49, and brother
Christian, 46, alone trying to wrest control from another
brother, Antoine, 42, the firm's president and largest
shareholder.
   The sale also effectively blunts efforts by the giant
Bouygues construction company from bidding for Gallimard. BNP
said it would hold the shares for several years. The sale to
BNP increases outside shareholdings in the family-controlled
business to about 30%.
   Ms. Gallimard said she based her decision on the inability
of the siblings to agree on how the firm should be operated.

   NEW YORK -- International Business Machines Corp. said it
expects its personal-systems business to gain market share in
1990, with revenue growing by a percentage in the "midteens"
or better.
   The optimistic estimate was made by James Cannavino, IBM's
general manager of personal systems, in an annual background
session for securities analysts here. It was the first time
the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant said what it meant by
previous statements that 1990 was shaping up as a "good"
year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue from IBM's personal-systems business, which
includes both personal computers and workstations, grew 18%
in 1989, to $8.24 billion, or 13.1% of IBM's total revenue.
During the same period, the world-wide market grew about 15%.
Mr. Cannavino said IBM expects world-wide growth in 1990 to
be somewhat slower"some place between single digits and
midteens."
   IBM's personal computers, 80% of which are sold through
retail channels, held a 34.7% share of that market in the
U.S. in 1989, according to Audits &amp; Surveys Inc., a
market-research firm. IBM's U.S. market share for
workstations during 1989 was minuscule, only about 2%, but
the company recently unveiled a hot new line called the RISC
System/6000, which should boost that number in 1990. No
reliable figures are available for IBM's world-wide market
share.
   Mr. Cannavino also said IBM has resolved supply problems
that plagued its personal-systems business last year, and is
promptly filling 94% of all orders for computers, up from
33%.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, IBM
closed at $105.875 a share, down 25 cents.

   BOSTON -- Eliot Bank reported a fourth-quarter loss of
$30.5 million, or $16.25 a share, and said regulators may
appoint a receiver if it fails to restore net capital to the
required level.
   Results included a $23.8 million provision for loan
losses, as troubled real estate loans contributed to a surge
in nonperforming assets. In the year-earlier period, Eliot
earned $165,000, or nine cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bank warned that its net capital is "significantly
below the minimum required" by regulators and that failure to
raise the capital could cause the Massachusetts Commissioner
of Banks and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to "take
such actions as they consider appropriate, including the
possible appointment of a receiver for the bank."
   Eliot is the second Massachusetts bank in recent days to
warn of the possibility that regulators might appoint a
receiver. Home National Corp. of Milford, Mass., last week
used nearly identical wording in disclosing a capital
shortfall.
   At Dec. 31, 1989, Eliot's total assets were $489.3 million
and stockholder equity was negative $13.8 million.
Nonperforming assets were $133.9 million at year end,
comprised of $104.3 million in nonaccruing loans and $29.6
million in foreclosed and "in substance foreclosure"
property.
   Eliot said it has reduced its reliance on borrowed funds
and other volatile liabilities.
   For 1989, Eliot reported a loss of $50.5 million, or
$26.89 a share, compared with year-earlier profit of $2.8
million, or $1.47 a share.

   State-owned Aerospatiale said the linkup of the two
helicopter lines "has been undertaken to boost
competitiveness and sharpen their ability to penetrate the
world market." Other aerospace groups will be invited to join
the venture, according to MBB.
   The West German and French partners have cooperated in
limited helicopter activities in recent years. They currently
are working together on the "Tiger" combat helicopter
project, as well as the NH-90 military helicopter program for
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   News of an impending Eurocopter venture emerged in early
March, when Aerospatiale officials confirmed that talks were
under way.
   The Aerospatiale helicopter joint venture is the latest of
a series of business links Daimler has been arranging
worldwide. Two weeks ago, Daimler agreed to link up its
civilian aircraft-engine business with the Pratt &amp; Whitney
division of United Technologies.
   Citing that business tie with Pratt &amp; Whitney, General
Electric Co. of Fairfield, Conn., last week sued Daimler for
breach of a previous agreement to cooperate exclusively with
GE in the area of highthrust jet engines. Daimler said Friday
it sees "no grounds" for the legal action.
   Meanwhile, Daimler also last month said it is discussing
far-reaching business links with the Mitsubishi group of
companies of Japan.
   For Aerospatiale, the cooperation pact with Daimler would
help it respond to French government pressure on industrial
groups to expand their industrial bases via alliances with
other European companies. Aerospatiale is Europe's largest
helicopter manufacturer, with sales of eight billion French
francs a year.
   Aerospatiale and MBB began exploring a cooperative venture
in the helicopter sector more than a year ago, but those
discussions were suspended while Daimler undertook the
controversial takeover of MBB.

   NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc., citing USAir
Group Inc.'s planned expansion effort and "reduced cash
flow," lowered its ratings on the carrier's long-term debt of
approximately $875 million.
   Moody's said it expects the company's "debt-protection
measurements will remain depressed over the intermediate term
in the wake of the difficulties in integrating Piedmont into
USAir." USAir acquired Piedmont Aviation Inc. in 1987.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A "cyclically weaker operating outlook for the industry,"
Moody's said, will limit USAir's ability to return to its
"historical earnings levels." The airline's ability to reduce
its currently high leverage may be limited by USAir's plans
to spend more than $1 billion annually during the next two
years to modernize and expand operations, Moody's said.
   A USAir spokeswoman said the report "speaks for itself as
a fair reflection of the company's current situation."
   The rating concern lowered the parent company's commercial
paper to Prime-3 from Prime 2. Ratings on equipment-trust
certificates and pass-through certificates issued by the
airline's USAir Inc. unit were downgraded to Baa1 from A3;
USAir Inc.'s senior debentures and industrial-revenue bonds
were lowered to Baa2 from Baa1.
   Also lowered were the ratings on equipment-trust
certificates issued by the company's Piedmont Aviation unit,
to Baa1 from A3; Piedmont industrial-revenue bonds were
reduced to Baa2 from Baa1.

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Bechtel Group Inc. said it signed an
agreement to conduct a preliminary study aimed at turning a
Soviet Union research community into an area similar to
California's Silicon Valley.
   Bechtel said the study is part of a plan to convert
Troitsk, located about 20 miles from Moscow, into a
"entrepreneurial, high-technology city." Troitsk is now the
site of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, where much
of the country's scientific research is conducted.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Bechtel said there are plans to upgrade the area's
airport, and install advanced telecommunications facilities
at Troitsk. Also, Bechtel said it's hoped that a conference
center, an international hotel, "U.S.-style housing" and
recreational facilities will be developed. Terms of the
agreement weren't disclosed.
   The closely held engineering and construction concern said
it's too early to estimate the cost of the project, but said
the Soviets have indicated they plan to spend $100 million a
year to build a series of such high-tech communities. With
the plan, Bechtel said, the Soviets "hope to convert their
purely research facilities at Troitsk into a series of
entrepreneurial ventures capable of jump-starting their
nation's faltering economy."

   Stock Market Shrugs Off Takeover Slump

   NEW YORK -- The takeover business may be in the doldrums,
but the stock market doesn't seem to care.
   Six months ago, the collapse of a proposed deal to take
over UAL Corp. battered the already shaky
merger-and-acquisition business. It also sent the Dow Jones
Industrial Average plunging more than 190 points to 2569.26
on Oct. 13, 1989, effectively eliminating what many analysts
termed "the merger premium" built into stock prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since then the deal business has remained depressed. Data
compiled by Birinyi Associates, a stock-market strategy firm,
show that the value of mergers and acquisitions announced in
the first quarter of 1990 totaled $12.5 billion, down from
$23.3 billion a year ago, and $68.5 billion in the first
quarter of 1988.
   Yet in the six months since the UAL debacle, the Dow hit a
new high, slipped again, and now stands at 2717.12; that is
within 93 points of its record high of 2810.15, an overall
decline of less than 3%.
   No one is claiming this is a roaring bull market. But the
fact that stock prices are holding their own while takeover
deals have seemingly disappeared does give some analysts a
bit more confidence in the U.S. stock market.
   "Deals were one of the two principal sources of capital
for the financial markets in 1988 and 1989," says Hugh
Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "For
us to be able to hold together as well as we have is pretty
impressive."
   One reason stock prices haven't collapsed, he points out,
is that while the high-profile leveraged buy-outs and
acquisitions that drew so much attention in 1988 and 1989
have virtually disappeared, corporations still are buying up
stock through stock buy-backs. He cites Federal Reserve data
that show corporations purchased shares at the annual rate of
$143.33 billion for the first three quarters of 1989, and
that those purchases continued at a $93 billion annual rate
in the fourth quarter of 1989, the latest period for which
the Federal Reserve provides data.
   "The point is, while corporations are certainly buying a
lot less stock, they're still buying," Mr. Johnson says.
"Corporate stock purchases didn't just disappear."
   Beyond that, Mr. Johnson points out that foreign
investors, the other big source of capital in 1988 and 1989,
are still putting their money into U.S. financial markets.
Indeed, he contends that the troubles afflicting the Japanese
stock market since the beginning of this year are giving U.S.
stocks and bonds a boost as international portfolio managers
divert money away from Japan and into the U.S. and West
Germany.
   Although there isn't yet solid data to support this
contention, Mr. Johnson cites the dollar's increasing
strength against the Japanese yen as evidence that funds are
flowing this way. And while much of that money is aimed at
the U.S. bond market, it indirectly bolsters the stock market
by producing lower interest rates than would otherwise be the
case.
   "If you help the bond market, you help the stock market,"
he says.
   New money from individual investors, much of it funneled
into the stock market through mutual funds, also has helped
offset the decline of corporate stock purchases in the past
six months. For the first nine months of 1989, mutual funds
were net sellers of stock at an annual rate of $5.8 billion.
But in the fourth quarter of 1989, just as corporate stock
purchases were slackening, mutual funds were net purchasers
of stock to the tune of $22.4 billion on an annualized basis.
   Finally, the first quarter of 1990 brought a modest upturn
in the economy, effectively allaying fears among many
investors that the U.S. was headed for a recession. The
prospect that corporate profits later this year will reflect
the modest rebound in the economy is bolstering stock prices,
especially in the so-called cyclical stocks that move with
the economic cycle.
   Yet while Mr. Johnson is encouraged that those various
props are supporting stock prices, he cautions that if one or
more of the props falls away, prices could fall, too.
   "If for some reason or another mutual funds don't like the
outlook or the Japanese market stabilizes, we might not get
the kind of nourishment we need from that money flowing into
the market," he says. "That makes it kind of a risky period."
   And some analysts argue that the Dow industrials don't
really reflect what has happened to the broader stock market
following the slump in takeover deals. The broader market is
where the loss of the "merger premium" has been felt the
most, they say.
   "The Dow may be at 2700, but to conclude that the rest of
the market has come back that far is an illusion," says
Suresh Bhirud, chief portfolio strategist at Oppenheimer.
"You can look at the Dow and say it hasn't been a bad market
since last October, but if you're running a broad portfolio
of stocks, you've been in more or less a bear market." In
particular, he points to the Nasdaq over-the-counter index,
which has lost some 15% since last October.
   Mr. Bhirud says the big problem with the merger boom in
1988 and 1989 is that it persuaded many investors to abandon
conservative forms of stock valuation based on earnings in
favor of such methods as "breakup value" and "price to cash
flow ratios."
   "If you look at the market prior to Oct. 13, you'll find
at least a couple of dozen stocks that were rumored to be
takeover targets selling at 20 to 30 times earnings," he
says. "Those kinds of values were not really justified except
under some immensely rosy circumstances."
   And investors who chased some of the stocks that were
supposedly targets of takeover attempts last year have been
burned this year. Birinyi Associates compiled an index of
speculative stocks, including such names as USX, Hilton, Mead
and Unisys, that were the targets of takeovers that were
never consummated. So far this year, the index is down 11.9%.
   "That tells us that investors have to be a little more
disciplined," says Mr. Birinyi. "It isn't going to pay to be
an ambulance chaser."
   Joseph A. Feshbach, Prudential-Bache's chief technical
stock-market analyst for six years, has been hired by
Shearson Lehman Hutton. He is related to, but unconnected
with, the Feshbach brothers of Palo Alto, Calif., well-known
shortsellers who aim to profit from stock price declines. His
Prudential-Bache market comment Wednesday said the "next
test" for the industrial average will be 2600. "All the trend
measures are extremely negative," he said, citing a
"breakdown in the Dow Jones Utility Index" and "extremely
high over-the-counter volume" compared with Big Board volume.
But he expects "good support" when the industrial average
hits 2580 to 2600.

   Stock prices drifted lower in slow trading as investors
continued to dump regional bank stocks and other issues
considered vulnerable to earnings problems.
   The latest bout of selling came after the March employment
report provided an indication of possible weakness in the
economy -- a rise in nonfarm payrolls that was considerably
smaller than expected.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 4.05 to 2717.12,
but managed to record a gain for the week of 9.91 points.
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 0.65 to 340.08
while the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.37
to 186.78 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 0.78 to
316.62.
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 137,490,000
shares. Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of
advancers 860 to 622.
   The employment data, released before the opening, showed
that payrolls rose just 26,000 last month -- well below the
consensus forecast of a Dow Jones Capital Markets survey of
economists, which projected an increase of 178,000. The
jobless rate fell 0.1 point, to 5.2%.
   Although economists said the report eased concerns that
the Federal Reserve might tighten monetary policy in order to
keep inflation under control, a round of sell programs
resulting from stock-index arbitrage sent prices lower in
early trading. The selloff in regional banks' shares then
regained momentum, keeping pressure on the broad market.
   The sector's downturn began Thursday, when analysts turned
negative on the group after meeting with federal banking
regulators who indicated that the companies face extensive
reviews of their loan portfolios.
   Banks are expected to begin reporting first-quarter
results this week, and the tough talk on loans has spurred
expectations that the banks' lending problems will translate
into weak earnings.
   PNC Financial, which estimated that its nonperforming
assets rose about 43% during the first quarter, plunged 3 7/8
to 34. Because of an increase in its provision for loan
losses, the concern said it expects to report net income for
the quarter fell 35% to 40% from the year-ago quarter.
   Bank of New York fell 1 1/4 to 30 as 1.4 million shares
changed hands. Other regional bank stocks that were hit with
selling included NCNB, which dropped 3/4 to 35 3/8; National
City, which fell 1 1/4 to 33 3/8; Mellon Bank, down 1 1/8 to
24 1/8; Citizens &amp; Southern, down 5/8 to 24 5/8; Sovran
Financial, down 5/8 to 32, and Signet Banking, down 1 1/4 to
23.
   Fears of shaky loans also sent Federal National Mortgage
Association, the most active Big Board issue, retreating 2
5/8 to 32 on 3.7 million shares. First Boston cut its
estimate of 1990 earnings slightly, citing its belief that a
widening of the difference between its loan rates and its
borrowing costs has peaked. Meanwhile, Federal Home Loan
Mortgage fell 3 1/2 to 65 1/4.
   Shares of big commercial banks closed mixed. Citicorp rose
3/8 to 22 7/8, Chase Manhattan slid 1/4 to 27 5/8,
Manufacturers Hanover added 3/8 to 31 1/8, BankAmerica fell
7/8 to 25 1/2, Chemical Banking slid 1/8 to 22 7/8 and J.P.
Morgan lost 3/8 to 34 5/8.
   Aluminum Co. of America dropped 1 3/8 to 62 on 1.4 million
shares, contributing to the decline in the Dow industrials,
as analysts at Prudential-Bache Securities and First Boston
made unfavorable comments on aluminum stocks. Reynolds Metals
dropped 5/8 to 53 1/2 after Prudential-Bache cut its estimate
of the company's first-quarter earnings.
   The technology sector, which has already delivered some
disappointing earnings estimates for the first quarter, came
in for some selling as well. International Business Machines
eased 1/4 to 105 7/8, Digital Equipment fell 1 1/4 to 78 1/2,
Compaq Computer declined 7/8 to 96 1/8, Hewlett-Packard
declined 1 1/8 to 43 3/4 and Motorola fell 3/4 to 65 1/8.
   UAL dropped 2 to 163 1/2 even though its board agreed in
principle to a buy-out bid, valued at $201 a share, from a
group of unions at its United Airlines subsidiary. The unions
said they are contributing $2 billion of labor concessions to
the offer -- but no cash -- and haven't yet obtained any
outside financing.
   Browning-Ferris Industries, which put its hazardous
waste-disposal business up for sale, climbed 1 1/2 to 36 7/8
as 1.8 million shares changed hands. The company said its
results for the March quarter would include a charge of $295
million related to the pullout.

   Accord to Boost
   Stock of Counsellors
   Tandem Reached

   NEW YORK -- Counsellors Tandem Securities Fund Inc.
reached an accord with a large investor designed to raise the
price of shares in the closed-end equity mutual fund.
   Counsellors Tandem said it plans to offer to buy as many
as two million shares of the fund at 95% of net asset value a
share; however, if at least 2.5 million shares are tendered,
which would be more than half of the fund's 4.9 million
shares outstanding, the tender offer will be canceled.
Instead, the fund will hold a special shareholder vote on a
proposal to liquidate the fund, which management would
support.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sequoia Partners L.P., which with other investors holds
about 1.2 million, or almost 26% of the fund's shares, has
been pressing for measures to boost the fund's price, and
considering replacing the fund's board of directors.
Closed-end funds sell a limited number of shares, and
typically trade at a discount to net asset value. Timothy
Hurley, general partner of Sequoia, said, "We feel it's a
fair resolution. Our aim was to try to get the discount
eliminated, and this (agreement) goes a long way" toward that
end.
   Tandem also will tender about 33% of the outstanding
preferred shares at $49.50 a share; it has about 880,000
shares of preferred outstanding.
   Under the agreement, two-thirds of each class of shares
would have to approve the liquidation proposal for it to take
effect.
   In a joint statement, John L. Furth, Tandem president, and
Mr. Hurley said, "We believe we have fashioned a creative
solution that will benefit all of Tandem's stockholders."
   Mr. Furth said, "We are going to recommend to our
shareholders they remain in the fund." Mr. Furth said those
who don't tender would gain "an immediate enhancement in net
asset value of 4%" over the current net asset value. As of
March 30, the per-share net asset value of Counsellors Tandem
was $11.90. He said the fund had "an outstanding record" in
the past few years, and was up more than 60% in 1989.
   Although Tandem's portfolio, which focuses on utility
stocks, has been ranked as one of the top-performing
closed-end equity funds, it has been trading at a discount to
net asset value. In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange Friday, Tandem shares closed at $11, unchanged.
   Mr. Furth said the fund's manager, Warburg, Pincus
Counsellors Inc., wouldn't tender any shares, and that it
would recommend to its clients against tendering. Those
interests together hold 700,000 to 800,000 Tandem shares, Mr.
Furth said.
   Under an agreement between Tandem and Sequoia, Tandem
postponed its combined annual and special meeting, which was
to have been tomorrow and Sequoia agreed to withdraw its
slate of nominees to the board. The combined annual and
special meeting will be postponed until after the tender
offer is consummated or terminated. If a special meeting is
needed to consider liquidation, election of directors and
selection of Tandem's independent auditors will occur at that
meeting. Sequoia agreed to back the management slate. It also
agreed not to purchase any more shares of Tandem for five
years.

   Greenberg Hopes to Get Comex's House in Order
   While Preparing a Merger With New York Merc

   NEW YORK -- Martin Greenberg has a full agenda for his new
two-year term as chairman of the Commodity Exchange, the
nation's leading metals market.
   Besides firming up the exchange's financial footing, Mr.
Greenberg will try to get the much-discussed merger of the
Comex and the New York Mercantile Exchange moving. Merger
talks among New York futures exchanges have been on and off
for at least 10 years, but nothing has ever happened.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although the current talks will resume this month, after a
break for the election of Comex officers last month, some
observers think a merger still will be tough to achieve.
   Mr. Greenberg, now 50 years old, began in commodities as a
"local," or independent floor trader, in 1976. "I got started
in commodities by checking three books on the subject out of
the library and reading them," Mr. Greenberg recalls. "I then
stood behind an experienced trader in the silver pit and
watched what he did."
   Today, Mr. Greenberg is chairman of Sterling Commodities
Corp., a New York-based futures and options broker that is a
clearing firm on the Comex. (All trades done on an exchange
must be processed through a clearing member of the exchange.
Such firms accept and process exchange transactions, collect
margin, or good-faith money, and insure financial settlements
between their customers and the exchange's clearing house.)
   His primary task, Mr. Greenberg says, "is getting the
exchange to function as a well-run business." Over the past
couple of months, the exchange has reduced its staff about
20%, reflecting lagging trading activity.
   Last year, futures trading in copper and precious metals
at the Comex increased by only 1.4%, while volume at all U.S.
futures exchanges rose 8.7%. Options trading at the Comex
decreased 12.9% while total options trading of all the
exchanges rose 12.8%. In the first quarter of this year,
trading picked up somewhat -- futures trading rose by 3.1%
and options volume jumped 27.8% -- primarily because of
action in gold.
   The Comex has long been searching for a successful new
product to boost trading volume. The last attempt was a
contract based on the Moody's Corporate Grade Bond Index.
About 11,000 contracts traded before it died in 1987.
   Last July, the exchange lured Arnold Staloff away from the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange to be its new president and chief
executive officer and to spur the development of new
contracts; he had been head of new-product development at the
Philadelphia exchange. Comex has not announced any new
products since Mr. Staloff's arrival.
   As for the proposed merger, it's no secret that Mr.
Greenberg favors it. In addition to the five Comex seats he
owns, Mr. Greenberg also owns four on the New York Merc, two
on the New York Cotton Exchange, and one seat each on the
Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Mr. Greenberg says a merger would benefit both Comex and
the New York Merc, which trades crude oil and other energy
futures and options, plus platinum and palladium. "It's the
equivalent of baseball, apple pie and mom," he says, because
it would reduce operating costs and give the merged exchanges
a stronger voice in Washington.
   Some industry observers say the existence of five
independent New York exchanges is a luxury they can't afford
anymore, when the two Chicago exchanges are doing more than
75% of the futures and option business in the U.S. Moreover,
the New York Merc now does more than 50% of all the trading
done by the New York exchanges because of its energy
contracts. Based on last year's numbers, a combined Merc and
Comex would have done about 18% of the futures volume and 16%
of the option volume in the U.S., making it a more formidable
competitor to the huge Chicago exchanges.
   Nonetheless, negotiating an agreement acceptable to 772
Comex members and 760 New York Merc members won't be easy,
according to people close to the merger talks. "If it were up
to Lou (Z. Lou Guttman, chairman of the Merc) and me, we
could work out an agreement over lunch," Mr. Greenberg says.
As it is, any plan must be approved by at least two-thirds of
each exchange's members. Also representing Comex in the
negotiations is Robert Fink, whom Mr. Greenberg succeeded as
Comex chairman.
   Mr. Greenberg notes that the merger proposal could run
aground on almost any issue, even one that the merger
negotiators themselves consider innocuous. An acceptable
agreement must have the right "bells and whistles" in it, he
says.
   An initial issue that was thought to be a sticking point
had to do with seat prices. Seats on the Merc sell for
roughly twice the price of those on Comex. For example, a
Merc seat sold for $192,000 on March 21, while a Comex seat
sold for $100,000 last Tuesday. The merger committee
sidestepped that issue by agreeing that there would be no
crossover trading -- members of each exchange will be
permitted to trade only their contracts. According to a Merc
official, there are no plans to have a "super seat" whose
owner would have trading rights on both exchanges. However,
new products that are related neither to metals nor energy
would be open to members of both exchanges.
   Mr. Greenberg believes the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission's new rule on who may be a member of exchange
boards and certain committees could make governing more
difficult. The rule bars members with histories of trading
violations and suspensions from those positions. In some
cases, he says, rigid application of this rule could be
tantamount to "disqualifying a person from running for office
for a jaywalking ticket." He adds, however, that the rule is
appropriate for someone who demeans the integrity of the
market.
   Though he no longer trades regularly in the pit, Mr.
Greenberg's family is well-represented on the Comex floor.
His son, David, 25, is a "local" in the gold pit, and his
son-in-law, Eric Plateis, 30, does the same in the silver
pit.
   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   Has West Texas Intermediate crude finally joined the world
oil market? This week's activity in the New York Merc's crude
pit may supply the answer. It could determine if last week's
fall in West Texas Intermediate futures prices means that the
U.S. benchmark no longer can remain aloof from the rest of
the crudes.
   West Texas has been under pressure since January. But
prices for other crudes, such as the "sours" with high sulfur
content, fell faster. Then, West Texas suddenly lost its
lofty perch, if only temporarily.
   Several reasons were cited by oil analysts for last week's
plunge of $1.13 a barrel in the price of the May contract.
One major factor, they said, was new evidence that a glut of
crudes was developing because of high OPEC output. But also
important was the dashing of hopes that gasoline demand would
continue to climb, supporting the "sweet" crudes such as West
Texas, which have a high yield of the light fuels. Instead of
rising, gasoline demand is showing evidence of slowing.
"Demand is flat," one analyst said.
   Analysts generally assume that prices of West Texas as
well as other crudes will go lower before recovering. But
timing of the turnaround is debated. Until recent days, most
analysts expected prices to turn up sometime in the second
half after a seasonal softening in the second quarter. But
more are now looking for an earlier rebound. Fereidun
Fesharaki of the Resource Systems Institute at Honolulu's
East-West Center forecasts that West Texas will be back up to
$20.75 a barrel in June after dropping to $18 a barrel in
May. On Friday, the price of West Texas for May delivery
settled at $19.15.
                                                                                                       

   Grains and Soybeans
                                                                                                       

   Analysts said they were awaiting two Agriculture
Department reports due tomorrow as an indication of futures
prices direction over the next several days. The department's
world crop report will give analysts and traders a better
idea of the size of crops being harvested in the southern
hemisphere. A bumper Brazilian soybean crop in particular has
been weighing on U.S. soybean prices for the past several
weeks. A report on U.S. crop supply and demand figures as of
April 1 will be a guide to "old crop," or last season's
harvest, and corn and wheat prices, analysts said. Analysts
said they were also concerned that many trend-following
commodity funds may start selling off their substantial corn
futures holdings based on Friday's slump in prices. On
Friday, soybean and corn futures prices rallied sharply in
early trading on unfounded rumors that a nuclear accident had
occurred in the Soviet Union. The rumors appeared to have
been generated by a report -- on continuing radioactive
contamination caused by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant
meltdown -- delivered in late March by Soviet scientists at a
medical ethics conference in Poland. Word of the scientists'
report, which advocated mass evacuations of parts of
Belorussia that remain contaminated by the Chernobyl
accident, were carried in the European press Wednesday and
Thursday. Wheat futures for May delivery closed down 4.75
cents a bushel Friday at $3.65 a bushel. May corn and soybean
futures both closed one cent a bushel lower at $2.695 and
$5.95 a bushel, respectively.
                                                                                                       

   Cocoa
                                                                                                       

   The rally that has carried cocoa to a nine-month high of
$1,285 per metric ton on Thursday from a 14-year low of $900
last fall may soon begin to run into some resistance,
analysts say.
   Brazil, the only major producer to harvest a substantial
second crop, or midcrop, will have fresh supplies of cocoa in
coming weeks. This will help to satisfy some of the demand
for cocoa beans and could slow the rise in prices, analysts
say.
   However, dry weather in Brazil and West Africa, two of the
world's principal growing areas, will continue to cause
uncertainty in the market and support prices, analysts say.
West Africa, which includes such major cocoa-growing
countries as the Ivory Coast, the world's top producer, and
Nigeria and Ghana, has had only a fraction of its normal
rainfall in the past two months.
   However, the critical West African pod-setting season,
which runs from June through August, is still some time away.
This creates the possibility of significant rainfall before
then, which could help the cocoa crop.

   CBS Gets First TV Rights
   For MCA's 1989 Movies

   For the first time in more than a decade, a television
network has won first-run TV rights from a major movie
studio, bypassing the usual sales to cable TV.
   Industry officials say an as-yet undisclosed pact signed
between CBS Inc. and MCA Inc.'s Universal Pictures unit will
provide the third-place network with all of Universal's
direct 1989 releases, including the box-office hits "Field of
Dreams" and "Born on the Fourth of July."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Details of the agreement weren't available. People in the
industry speculate that CBS will pay about $50 million for
rights to run the films during its 1990-1991 season. Network
officials couldn't be reached. A spokesman for Universal
declined to comment.
   Analysts said the pact is a striking departure from recent
industry patterns, in which rights to feature films (after
theater showings) are sold for video distribution, then cable
broadcast, and finally -- at a sharply reduced price -- to
the three major TV networks.
   "This is going back to the good old days," said Alan
Kassan, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   Although Universal's contract with CBS appears a marriage
of convenience impelled by unusual circumstances on both
sides, the pact may foreshadow changes in relationships
between the major movie studios and cable TV services, some
analysts say. "I fully expect that the networks will be
bidding heavily with pay TV for movie rights in the next few
years," said Steven Rosenberg, head of his own consulting
firm, Rose Media Corp., in Pebble Beach, Calif. He says
networks are relying increasingly on major sporting events
and perhaps blockbuster movies to promote other parts of
their programming lineups.
   CBS's purchase of the film rights raises questions about
the strength of its programming lineup. "The network, with
its weak prime-time ratings, needs to look for a new
strategy, particularly for the sweeps," said Mr. Kassan. The
sweeps are the four-times-a-year rating periods that test the
relative popularity of television programming.
   For MCA and Universal, the agreement fulfills a
longstanding drive to circumvent Time Warner Inc.'s Home Box
Office and Viacom Inc.'s Showtime/The Movie Channel, whose
dominance of pay television gives the two cable empires
paramount positions in bidding for movie rights.
   That dominance not long ago led MCA's mercurial president,
Sidney J. Sheinberg, to threaten that the company not only
would try to sell movies directly to the major networks, but
might even seek informal networks of local stations to
exhibit Universal films.
   Antipathies between MCA and the cable barons apparently
remain high. MCA and Universal's talks with Home Box Office
to renew a recently expired five-year movie-rights pact were
particularly difficult, people in the industry say. Analysts
believe the pay-TV company paid far too much for rights in
the earlier pact for what proved a weak movie lineup and thus
was determined to keep the price down on any new arrangement.
Home Box Office officials couldn't be reached for comment.
   At the same time, the popularity of Universal's film
offerings improved markedly last year, convincing the studio
that it should be paid more for any new contract.
   The 10 1989 movies CBS will pick up first-run rights to
include producer-director Spike Lee's critical success "Do
the Right Thing;" "Sea of Love," with Al Pacino; "Uncle
Buck," starring John Candy; "K-9," starring Jim Belushi; as
well as "Field of Dreams" and "Born on the Fourth of July."
Also included in the package are less popular features:
"Fletch Lives," "Renegades," "Shocker," and "The Wizard," a
dud about a youthful video-game whiz.
   The agreement apparently excludes movies by Imagine Films
Entertainment Inc., which under a separate arrangement have
been sold to Showtime, with subsequent broadcasts arranged
with CBS. Imagine, a separate company, has close ties to
Universal in its feature film production and distribution.
Imagine's 1989 movies include "The Burbs," "The Dream Team,"
and "Parenthood," one of the year's better-grossing films.
   Also excluded are movies of Steven Spielberg's Amblin
Entertainment Co., including "Dad," "Back to the Future, Part
2" and "Always."
   It's not clear whether MCA will win or lose revenue in the
short term with its prospective end run around pay
television. Mr. Kassan estimated that the company took in
about $120 million in revenue last year from pay cable
licensing. Of that total, about $85 million came from Home
Box Office and the remainder from Showtime, he said.
   If industry speculation is correct that revenue from the
CBS pact will be around $50 million, then the television
broadcast rights may fall short of last year, although
revenue from Imagine Films and Amblin Entertainment may fill
in much of the gap.
   An equally important question remains for CBS: Will it get
an audience response that justifies its outlays -- whatever
they may be?
   Before home video rentals and pay TV entered the equation,
networks could count on big ratings for blockbuster movies.
But analysts question whether a prospective audience, gorged
on $2 home video rentals, will sit through a critically
esteemed movie interrupted by commercials. In some cases,
research suggests audiences accept only certain "franchise"
films, such as Sylvester Stallone's beefcake melodramas or
James Bond movies, with commercial breaks.

   {Do not consider} who was right in political disputes
between Congress and the president, between Democrats and
Republicans or between liberals and conservatives.
   -- Judge Greene, instructing the jury.
                                                                                                       

   {There's no question that even being charitable to Admiral
Poindexter, he did it because he wanted to protect the
political viability of Ronald Reagan. And I consider that to
be a selfish motive.}
   -- Independent counsel prosecutor Dan Webb after the
verdict.
                                                                                                       

   What has been resolved by the Iran-Contra trials, what has
been established? Congress and the Democratic Party have
achieved a victory of sorts. A jury has declared that John
Poindexter violated congressional law by not being frank
enough in his dealings with Congress. Politics goes on,
though, and it's a little ironic how far away politics has
moved from the original substance of this dispute.
   For example, is the Poindexter verdict a repudiation of
President Reagan's Nicaragua policy? Judge Greene's directive
notwithstanding, that of course is a political question. On
the evidence, the policy is a success. Congressional policy
was to stop the Contras from pressuring the Soviet-supported
Sandinista government. Despite the five anti-Contra Boland
amendments, the White House did keep the Contras alive body
and soul, and they made Sandinista consolidation impossible.
When the Nicaraguans got to vote, they removed the
Sandinistas from power.
   On the legal side, if the Iran-Contra convictions are
upheld on appeal we will have some very curious precedents.
President Reagan was forced to testify, but Judge Greene
refused to subpoena 65 congressmen. Mr. Poindexter's lawyers
wanted to show that Members were not deceived because they
knew before Mr. Poindexter's testimony about aid to the
Contras and the missile shipment to Iran. In other words, we
may never know what congressmen knew and when they knew it.
Those who say the Poindexter case shows that the President
isn't above the law profess no concern that Congress is far
above the law.
   Treating criminal trials as an extension of partisan
politics leaves the President's political status vis a vis
Congress pretty much where it was. Congress will keep trying
to commandeer presidential power by any means so long as the
President fails to guard his office. One likely change is
that on advice of counsel, executive-branch officials will
almost certainly be less frank in their congressional
testimony, lest in difficult matters they become the target
of a congressman's demand for a special prosecutor.
   This congressional criminalizing of policy differences
with the executive branch will probably only end when the
Democrats think they have some prospect of regaining the
presidency. They now pay no price for substituting litigation
for politics. They are happy for judges and juries to become
a proxy for the electorate -- except that in the Ollie North
and Poindexter trials the juror-voters had to convince the
court that they knew nothing whatsoever about the political
life of the country. The judiciary might ask itself if it
really wants to play the top role in this brutal political
game.
   For the larger electorate, Iran-Contra will be remembered
for the televised hearings which gave ample opportunity for
the public to form its opinion of the matter. For President
Reagan and his treatment by history, Iran-Contra will likely
be a footnote against the fall of communism -- including in
Nicaragua.
   President Bush now has the opportunity of the post-Cold
War era to find a modus vivendi with Congress that doesn't
drive politics into courtrooms. He should seriously consider
a pardon for the Iran-Contra defendants, veto any more
special prosecutor laws and tell Congress that foreign policy
will again be set the old-fashioned way, by give and take
between the two political branches of government.

   TUCSON, Ariz. -- Tucson Electric Power Co.'s auditors
cited a host of contingent liabilities and uncertainties.
   In a letter to shareholders, the auditors, Deloitte &amp;
Touche, noted that the company faces various regulatory and
legal decisions as well as contractual matters.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In 1989, Tucson Electric had a loss of $89.9 million, or
$3.55 a share, on $593.7 million in revenue.
   Tucson Electric said it decided not to take charges that
last year would have resulted in a $74 million widening of
the loss. The utility said that it may decide to record a
liability for the potential charge, which involves a gain
posted years ago, a portion of which regulators now are
saying belongs to rate-payers. Tucson Electric is challenging
that ruling by the Arizona Corporation Commission.
   Also troubling the company is the $722 million investment
in the Springerville 2 coal-fired generating station. The
unit is nearing completion. However, Arizona regulators have
questioned the need for the capacity, which could result in
Tucson Electric's being barred from recovering some or all of
the unit's costs from rate-payers.
   Tucson Electric warned that "either substantial retail
rate increases or additional wholesale sales {or a
combination thereof} will be required to recover such costs"
of Springerville 2. Without recovery, "the company will
suffer increasingly deteriorating financial results, will be
unable to earn a reasonable return on its utility investment,
and will continue to have negative cash flow."
   Tucson Electric eliminated dividend payments on its common
stock earlier this year. The company has said it expects to
post losses and sees no chance of restoring the dividend in
the foreseeable future.
   Based on certain coverage tests, the company is barred
from issuing additional preferred stock. A net earnings test
also limits to about $70 million the amount of additional
first mortgage bonds that can be sold by the company, which
added that the amount of bonds it can issue under the
earnings test is expected to dwindle through this year, as
anticipated operating losses are reported.
   However, Tucson Electric said it can issue as much as $118
million of bonds by current calculation without meeting the
net earnings test, based on bonds retired after the most
recent filing of a net earnings certificate with the bond
indenture trustee.
   The company currently is trying to negotiate a new master
credit agreement that would provide as much as $350 million
of borrowing capability and would supplant all existing
short-term credit facilities.
   Current company short-term financial facilities include a
$150 million revolving bank credit agreement that expires in
May 1991, and $100 million in various bank lines expiring
from March 30 to July 31 of this year. Tucson Electric said
it is seeking a renewal of these lines until a master credit
agreement can be negotiated. Four banks holding $40 million
of debt refused to extend and were paid in December and
January.

   Dollar's Climb Against Yen Is Expected

   NEW YORK -- The dollar is expected to continue its climb
against the yen, despite any turbulent trading that may be
ahead.
   Any profit-taking and central-bank intervention that may
occur probably wouldn't be enough to knock the dollar off
course, currency analysts say. They cite skepticism about the
new trade accord between the U.S. and Japan and low
confidence in Japan's financial markets as influences working
on the dollar's behalf.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "To stay cautiously long dollars" is how many traders may
try to play the market, says David Lapin, national
foreign-exchange sales manager at Bank of America, Los
Angeles. "We're still looking for a stronger dollar."
   In late afternoon New York trading Friday, the dollar was
at 157.65 yen, up from 157.40 late Thursday. But the dollar
was below the 39-month high of 160.30 yen it reached Monday
before retreating on profit-taking before this weekend's
Group of Seven meeting of major industrial nations in Paris.
G-7 nations include the U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany,
France, Italy and Canada.
   In early trading Monday, the dollar briefly sank below 156
yen, responding to optimistic Japanese news coverage about
the G-7 meeting. The dollar later regained some ground and
closed Tokyo's morning session at 156.70.
   The dollar traded at 1.6950 marks late Friday, off from
1.6995 marks. Sterling was at $1.6425, slightly higher than
$1.6422 late Thursday.
   Because of the yen's incessant weakness during the past 15
months, the dollar's relationship to the Japanese currency
has become the primary concern of the foreign-exchange market
and global-monetary officials. While the dollar has soared
against the yen recently, it has barely budged against the
mark and other major foreign currencies.
   Since February 1987, market participants have believed
that the G-7 is content when the dollar is in a trading range
of 120 to 140 yen, a band that would foster stable exchange
rates and help diminish inflationary pressures and trade
imbalances in the U.S. and Japan.
   Another round of profit-taking could hit the dollar if it
surges to 160 yen, and central banks may fight to keep it
from soaring above that level with more concerted sales, some
traders say.
   Even so, the dollar's uptrend isn't seen crumbling anytime
soon.
   Traders are still on the lookout for "the best place to
buy" whenever the dollar slips, says Takaharu Fukawa, a
treasury officer at Sumitomo Trust &amp; Banking Co.
   There were some suspicions that the dollar would come
under pressure as soon as the U.S. and Japan hammered out an
agreement to solve their sticky trade problems. But that
probably won't be the case, even though U.S. criticism of
Japan is abating.
   U.S. and Japanese officals agreed on a tentative plan
Thursday, the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative,
that aims to topple trade barriers in Japan and help the U.S.
compete more in that nation's markets. But until the
agreement is completed and Japan is out of political hot
water with the U.S., the trade accord probably won't be used
as an excuse to sell dollars, some currency analysts say.
   External and internal pressures on Japan to fix its trade
imbalance contributed to the lessening of confidence in that
nation and the battering of the yen.
   "I don't see any reason for a sea change in sentiment"
because trade relations between the U.S. and Japan are
warming, says Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High
Frequency Economics Ltd., an international economic-research
firm in New York.
   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan, the largest with any
single country, contracted to $2.86 billion in January from
$3.49 billion in December. Last year, the total shortfall was
$49 billion.
   Meanwhile, the battery of bearish yen fundamentals is
expected to keep the stronger dollar's motor running.
   Capital continues to leak out of Japan, where the stock
and bond markets have been in turmoil for months; interest
rates remain relatively low, and land prices are
astronomically high. "There's no real good place to put money
in Japan right now," says Mr. Weinberg.
   Despite the growing belief that Japanese investors will
have a big appetite for European investments this year, any
diversification of portfolios probably won't be very
detrimental to the dollar, Mr. Weinberg contends.
   There is a "growing pie" of Japanese capital, he says,
adding that the slice for the U.S. should be enough to keep
the dollar "comfortable" at high levels.
   But despite the dollar's impressive 11% rise against the
yen so far this year, there remains an undercurrent of doubt
among some traders about the potential of the currency to
climb in the near term.
   "I think we're going to have temporary dollar weakness,"
says Christiane Mandell, a trader at Security Pacific
Merchant Bank in Los Angeles. The dollar, she says, may head
toward 150 yen soon.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange Friday, current-delivery
gold settled at $380.70 an ounce, up $5.90. Estimated volume
was a moderate 2.6 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong, gold opened Monday at $380.10 an ounce.

   During Mrs. Gramm's two years on the panel, she and the

policing the Chicago commodity exchanges more closely. But

   Indiscriminate Run on Bank Stocks Means
   Some Investing Bargains May Be Available

   NEW YORK -- Take 70 nervous securities analysts, add some
federal regulators determined not to end up in the Capitol
Hill pillory with M. Danny Wall and, voila, you have Wall
Street's latest concoction: bank stocks flambe.
   That's what was served up last week when bank stocks got
scorched across a broad front and investors dumped everything
from the golden likes of J.P. Morgan to the tarnished Bank of
New England.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In two meetings last week with accountants and securities
analysts, the U.S. comptroller of the currency sought to
clear the air over reports that bank examiners had changed
the rules on what constitutes a non-performing loan. But
instead of dispelling misconceptions, the regulators only
added to the pall hanging over bank stocks.
   "The meeting reinforced the view that banking companies
are guilty until proven innocent," says James J. McDermott
Jr., research director at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. "It's a
time unlike any in my 13 years as a bank analyst."
   Katherine Hensel, a Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst, thinks
that's the effect the regulators wanted: "The regulators'
intent wasn't to scare us but to enlist our support as
watchdogs to discipline the banks. What better regulator is
there than the marketplace?"
   Maybe, but investors mowed down the bank stocks
indiscriminately. Now is the time for bold bank investors to
step forward, some investors say. Ann Robinson, a bond
analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, says, "You'll look
back on this as a time of good buying opportunities."
   The extreme slump in bank stocks could easily persist
through early June as regulators continue their reviews of
real estate loans and highly leveraged deals. Meanwhile
analysts suggest that investors start nibbling at selected
stocks on signs of weakness.
   At current prices, dividend yields on many big banks are
about 7%, double the market average of 3.5%. Such a wide gap
presaged rallies in bank stocks in the early 1980s and after
the stock market crash in 1987. There are values in bonds,
too, some yielding 15% and more.
   Any bargain hunter's short list has to include Citicorp.
At $22.875 a share, it's trading well below year-end book
value of $25.39 and at only about 6 times some analysts'
earnings estimates for this year. Citicorp's consumer
business alone (profit of possibly $1 billion, or $3 a share,
this year) justifies the current stock price, some say. The
icing on the cake is a 7.2% yield, with a dividend increase
expected before long.
   Citicorp sticks out like a lightning rod in the storm
surrounding bank stocks. It is the nation's biggest lender to
commercial real estate and highly leveraged transactions
($12.6 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively). But rivals
lack Citicorp's global presence and leadership in such
diverse areas as credit cards, home mortgages and foreign
exchange. Citicorp has what Chairman John S. Reed calls
"granularity" in loans -- portfolios broadly diversified by
geography and customer. Commercial real estate loans in the
company's home state, New York, represent only 10% of its
real estate loans. And domestic commercial real estate loans
account for only 7.5% of Citicorp's global commercial and
consumer loan portfolio.
   Citicorp in recent years has been doing more
five-to-seven-year mortgage loans -- considerably safer than
construction loans, which are down to about 40% of its
portfolio from 60% six or seven years ago. Still, some think
non-performing real estate loans could double again this
year, to $2.2 billion by year-end.
   For highly leveraged deals, Citicorp's first-quarter
results will show a jump in non-performing assets. The
bankruptcy-law filing by Campeau Corp.'s Allied and Federated
alone will add $288 million to the year-end $407 million. But
highly leveraged deals accounted for only 3.8% of Citicorp's
operating earnings last year, compared with 37% for Bank of
Boston, 10% for Bank of New York and 10% for Manufacturers
Hanover.
   Citicorp's biggest negative: Reserve coverage is on the
light side, with a $5.2 billion loan-loss reserve to cover
$8.6 billion of non-performing loans at year-end. It will
need to eat into earnings more just to maintain 61% coverage,
much less reach a more respectable 70%. Coupled with its
stated goal of boosting core equity to 4.5% from 3.6% of
assets -- a $2 billion rise -- through retained earnings and
asset sales, Citicorp will be stretched this year.
   Among other banks, Chase Manhattan hasn't shown its
rival's creativity, but has a more conservative credit
culture and a stronger capital base. Norwest, Mellon Bank and
BankAmerica have spent recent years rebuilding themselves,
and have relatively small exposures in real estate and
debt-heavy deals.

   The Outlook:
   U.S. Firms Increase
   Overseas Investments

   NEW YORK -- Given foreigners' high-profile purchases of
U.S. real estate and U.S. companies, foreign investment
sometimes seems a one-way street. Foreigners, especially the
Japanese, are accused of buying up America.
   This is a half-truth at best. Foreign investment is
flowing into the U.S., but capital also is flowing out
rapidly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   American companies are spending more and more on
acquisitions overseas, especially in Europe. Moreover, they
are raising their foreign spending on plant and equipment at
a record pace. One recent example: General Motors' Opel unit
plans to spend more than $500 million on a car-building joint
venture in East Germany.
   The larger issue is whether U.S. companies are likely to
be leaders or laggards in the trend toward the globalization
of markets and industries. Companies operating in the major
markets of North America, Europe and Asia are far more likely
to prosper in the 1990s than those that don't, experts say.
So, U.S. companies' stepped-up activity abroad is an
encouraging sign.
                                                                                                       

   For many U.S. companies, the spending increases are a
matter of building on their past success. Large American
companies have long been important in Europe; some are even
more competitive than their European and Japanese rivals.
                                                                                                       

   "IBM and Digital Equipment are very strong. They made most
of their money in Europe last year," notes Todd Hixon at
Boston Consulting Group.
   Much of such profits is being plowed back into operations
overseas. Last week, the Commerce Department estimated that
U.S. plant-and-equipment spending overseas would rise 13%
this year to $54.9 billion.
   Western Europe and the newly industrialized countries of
Asia are the big investment targets. "Increases in Europe
have been in double digits since 1987," says Raymond J.
Mataloni at the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.
"And spending in the NICs during the last three years has
been up 37%, up 31% and up 24%."
   Another form of investment into Europe is acquisitions of
European companies. Translink's European Deal Review notes a
big upturn in intra-European takeovers. And smaller U.S.
companies are rushing to buy companies, both in Britain and
on the Continent, with 185 acquisitions valued at $15.2
billion last year, about double the 1988 level.
   Such figures are only partial measures of foreign
investment, however. Direct foreign investment in the U.S. is
increasing faster than Americans' direct investment overseas.
And in 1988, for the first time, the total book value of
foreign holdings in the U.S. in 1988 exceeded U.S. holdings
overseas. At the end of 1989, the foreign holdings totaled
$390 billion, compared with U.S. overseas holdings of $368.1
billion. However, since inflation leaves book values far
below market values, the true worth of the U.S. holdings,
which are far older on the average, is greatly understated.
   Japanese investors have emerged as some of the most
aggressive investors in American real estate and American
companies, and their purchases of "trophy" assets -- such as
Sony's acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment and
Mitsubishi Estate's purchase of a controlling interest in
Rockefeller Center -- has sparked a political outcry on
Capitol Hill.
   ---
   However, another view suggests that foreign investment
flows to the economies with the strongest growth prospects.
During much of the 1980s, the economy in the United States
expanded rapidly and thus sucked in foreign capital. But what
about the 1990s? "The U.S. will attract investment, although
more slowly," says John Rutter, a senior economist at the
Commerce Department.
                                                                                                       

   The rate of growth in foreign investment in the U.S.,
including that by the British and Japanese, slowed a bit last
year. "European and Japanese buyers are choosing to focus
more heavily on Europe," says Ilan Kaufthal, managing
director at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.
                                                                                                       

   The one area where investment flows remain lopsided is
Japan, which historically has been inhospitable to foreign
investment. Acquisitions of Japanese companies are still
rare, partly because selling a company is repugnant to many
Japanese. Less than 1% of Japanese corporate assets were in
foreign hands in 1986, according to a study by the
London-based Royal Institute for International Studies. The
U.S. figure was 5%, and Britain and West Germany had in
excess of 10% in foreign hands.
   Last week, U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators reached an
agreement for Japan to relax its investment rules. If the
investment inflow does expand, it could increase trade and
reduce tensions across the Pacific. But if investment remains
largely one way, protectionists may well try to close the
investment street or at least limit the traffic from Japan.

   Junk Holdings Swell Cost of S&amp;L Bailout

<LP>
   The thrift industry sold or wrote down an estimated 22% of
its junk-bond holdings in the fourth quarter, incurring large
and controversial losses that are helping to swell the
overall cost of bailing out the sick industry.
   At Dec. 31, the total amount of junk bonds held by savings
and loan associations fell to $10.59 billion, or $2.93
billion less than the $13.52 billion held at Sept. 30,
according to government data collected by Sheshunoff
Information Services, an Austin, Texas,
financial-institutions research firm. The reduction reflects
outright sales of junk as well as write-downs to reflect
their deteriorating market value over the last several
months. Such write-downs are in effect required as part of
the thrift bailout law that Congress passed last August.
Under the law, thrifts must also divest their entire holdings
by the end of 1994.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, the reduction is proving increasingly painful
and costly. Of the 198 thrifts holding junk bonds at year
end, 36 have failed, including seven of the top 15, according
to the Sheshunoff report. Several other junk-bond-holding
thrifts are considered in imminent danger of a federal
seizure, including Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association of
Beverly Hills, Calif., the largest S&amp;L holder of junk bonds
with $3.69 billion at year end. Columbia said last week that
junk-bond losses through February had left it insolvent.
   As a result of federal takeovers of troubled institutions,
the federal Resolution Trust Corp. is now one of the nation's
biggest holders of junk bonds, with roughly $3.6 billion, or
enough to rival top-rated Columbia, according to the
Sheshunoff data. Lately, the government has been assembling a
junk-bond team to sell the portfolio, although it says it has
no plans to dump the junk quickly.
   Junk-bond losses are also rapidly adding to the estimated
government tab for resolving the S&amp;L crisis. On Friday, the
Congressional Budget Office revised to $325 billion from $257
billion its estimate of cleaning up the mess over a 30-year
period. Other analysts suggest that amount of loss will occur
in the next decade alone. Junk bonds are also accounting for
a growing share of the industry's on-going operating losses,
according to Kenneth Thomas, a Miami thrift consultant. Mr.
Thomas estimated that junk-bond losses alone accounted for
about 17%, or $1.2 billion, of the S&amp;L industry's $6.5
billion aggregate net losses in the fourth quarter. He also
said losses could increase because many thrifts have been
selling only their "best" junk bonds lately and holding onto
their most troubled issues.
   "I am sure the regulators rue the day they ever permitted
S&amp;Ls to buy junk bonds," said Allan Bortel, a San Francisco
thrift analyst and consultant.
   The issue is a bitter pill for some managers of junk-laden
thrifts to swallow, and it is also creating some rather
strange anomalies. Many such executives believe the
requirement to write down their holdings to market prices is
arbitrary and unfair because other thrifts and banks aren't
generally required to carry their assets at market. They said
the write-down and sales requirements are further depressing
an already weak market for such bonds.
   "When you make decisions based on holding assets to
maturity and then the rules change in the middle of the
ballgame, it is very difficult to be able to react," said a
spokesman for Mississippi Savings Bank, of Batesville, Miss.
About 17% of the thrift's $185 million in assets are junk
bonds. Recent write-downs left it in violation of minimum
federal capital standards. "We are not optimistic," the
spokesman added.
   Government regulators may also have exacerbated the
dilemma by allowing new private owners of once-failed thrifts
to continue buying junk bonds. Such institutions as American
Savings Bank, of Stockton, Calif., and Far West Federal Bank,
of Portland, Ore., built up significant junk-bond portfolios
following government-arranged private takeovers. American
Savings, which had about $493.6 million in junk bonds at
year-end, couldn't be reached for comment.
   Officials of Far West Federal said its roughly $130
million portfolio was closely regulated, that its write-downs
have approximated only about 5% of the total portfolio
through March 31, and that it has suffered no actual defaults
on any of its holdings. "It is not a junky junk portfolio,"
asserted David Nierenberg, Far West's chairman. The thrift
has nonetheless sued the federal government in Portland
federal court, alleging that it improperly backed out of a
rescue plan aimed at allowing Far West to rebuild its capital
through a series of complicated financial transactions known
as risk-controlled-arbitrage.
   By contrast, United Savings Assocation of Texas, has
reduced its junk-bond portfolio to about $129 million
currently from more than $500 million at the time the thrift
was taken over in late 1988 by a group including former
Salomon Brothers Inc. executive Lewis Ranieri, a spokesman
for that thrift said.
   But actual losses have been increasing, also. In a filing
last week with the federal Office of Thrift Supervision,
Columbia Savings, for example, said its non-accural junk
bonds had grown an additional $431.4 million just since Dec.
31, or 80% more than the $521.6 million in troubled junk it
reported at year-end. Columbia is basing its survival plan on
trying to sell its entire portfolio in a single transaction,
possibly as soon as the third quarter.

   Enticing Stellar Executives to Stay Put

   Most companies are a bit like Hydras: Cut off a head and
others appear, often indistinguishable from the first. But
sometimes there are those extraordinary leaders, with skill,
drive and vision, who aren't so easily replaced.
   Losing such a luminary can mean big trouble. A key lawyer
or sales star who exits can take major clients away or leave
dissatisfied ones. Hotshot computer programmers who defect
can send a company skidding. And high-rolling investment
bankers who depart often leave unfinished deals in their
wake. So the question is, how do you keep superstars from
bolting?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Some management specialists say it's impossible to corral
executives determined to flee. "I'm not sure anyone could
have kept Peter Lynch," says Gil Gordon, a Monmouth Junction,
N.J., consultant who specializes in employee retention
strategies. The stellar Mr. Lynch last month said he will
quit his job managing Fidelity Investments' $13 billion
Magellan Fund in order to spend more time with his family.
Still, Mr. Gordon and others say companies often lose key
creative talent when they don't have to.
   The secret, experts say, is determining what the stars
want. Money, of course, is high on the list, but so are the
intangibles of recognition and challenge, as well as the
emotional investment of owning a company. Flexibility and
time away from the fast track are also important. Here are
some of the suggestions from management specialists on how to
hold on to irreplaceable performers:
                                                                                                       

   MONEY
                                                                                                       

   Dollars are the first thing many people think of.
   That explains why many companies design programs to make
it expensive for a key executive to leave. For example, they
give packages of restricted stock that executives can't touch
until near retirement age -- say, 55 or 60 years old.
   Such packages might be worth five to 10 times an
individual's salary. But companies seeking to keep a star
from leaving can go much higher. Roger Brossy, a principal
with compensation consultants Sibson &amp; Co., says he is
working with a Fortune 500 company that's trying to attract a
key executive; the manager's current firm, though, is
offering him stock worth 20 times his $300,000 to $400,000
annual salary to stay. He hasn't made up his mind yet.
   Yet, Carl Menk, chairman of search firm Canny Bowen Inc.,
adds: "Money won't move {a star} unless there's also an
improvement in career path. The No. 1 reason people leave is
that they see their career decelerating.
                                                                                                       

   RECOGNITION
                                                                                                       

   Many consultants agree that money isn't everything,
especially for superstars who may have more than they need.
"Reward systems have three components: economic social and
psychological," says Robert E. Kelley, a business professor
at Carnegie Mellon University. "More often than not, {stars}
want artistic freedom and recognition more than they want
money. They see themselves making long-term contributions to
the firm."
   J. Gerald Simmons, president of Handy Associates, an
executive-search firm, cites a bank that moved quickly to
hold a computer whiz who was ready to jump ship to a
competitor. The bank not only boosted his salary and bonus,
it doubled his responsibility, had him report to a vice
chairman instead of a lower-level official, and placed him in
the long-term executive incentive program. "The money was
important, but the key thing was being recognized as a
participant," says Mr. Simmons. The star employee is still
with that bank.
                                                                                                       

   OWNERSHIP
                                                                                                       

   Four years ago, Barbara Provus was well-paid, happy with
her job, and not dissatisfied with the management of the
executive recruiting firm, Lamalie Associates, for which she
worked. But that didn't prevent her and three colleagues from
quitting en masse to found their own firm. Two other
colleagues soon followed -- a loss of six individuals from a
22-person firm. What could have induced them to stay?
   "In real estate, it's location, location, location. For
us, it was equity, equity, equity," says Ms. Provus, today a
principal at Sweeney Shepherd, a search firm in Chicago.
"Many times, the `other opportunity' either offers more
equity or more of a voice in management -- or the perception
of more of a voice in management."
   Later, Lamalie Associates was sold to its partners and
since then the concern hasn't lost anyone it has wanted to
retain, says Jack Wissman, a vice president. Adds Ms. Provus:
"There's nothing like feeling you are an owner to really form
a strong commitment."
                                                                                                       

   CHALLENGE
                                                                                                       

   For many years Kenichi Ohmae wasn't just important to
McKinsey &amp; Co. in Japan. "Ken WAS McKinsey," says William
Matassoni, a partner in the giant consulting firm. "If he had
left five years ago, we would have had big trouble. In Japan,
we wouldn't have been able to survive Ken leaving." While
there was never any active prospect that the expert on
Japanese business and managerial style would depart, Mr.
Matassoni says the company wanted to keep it that way.
   "We gave him lots of new challenges," says Mr. Matassoni.
He worked with clients in new ways, handled more counseling
and fewer traditional product-market studies. Mr. Ohmae also
devoted more attention to writing books, and to taking strong
-- and controversial -- stands on trade issues and
protectionism. McKinsey also restructured its operations to
free Mr. Ohmae from many day-to-day tasks, giving him more
free time, and giving others more responsibility.
   "McKinsey is still a great place for Ken Ohmae to be,"
says Mr. Matassoni. "You can't ask people to stay. They have
to want to stay. You have to make sure your organization is
the place for them to be. As soon as they think of it as a
con tract, you are probably losing the battle."
   "I appreciate the firm and the colleagues who have allowed
me to do these things. They've allowed me to explore these
mind-stretching exercises," says Mr. Ohmae, who plans to stay
with the firm until his retirement -- in 2003.
                                                                                                       

   FREEDOM
                                                                                                       

   Back in the mid-1980s, Tektronix Inc. of Beaverton, Ore.,
had a problem: Venture capital was flooding into the Pacific
Northwest, with the very real possibility of seducing away
the company's best people and ideas. So the maker of
electronic equipment had a brainstorm: Let them go, but
acquire a piece of the action. It founded Tektronix
Development Co., a $30 million fund with the mandate of
financing Tektronix's managers' good ideas.
   Tektronix feels that if it can't use an idea itself, "we
will spin you out and fund you, or part of you, so that in a
way, we hang on to you," says Richard Hill, vice president of
the development company.
   In the six years since the fund's founding, the company
has financed a dozen ventures, about half are from outsiders
but the other half are from Tektronix managers. "They are no
longer employees of Tektronix per se, but we have access to
them, and to whatever they come out with," says Mr. Hill.
                                                                                                       

   TIME
                                                                                                       

   Magellan Fund's Mr. Lynch, in announcing his departure,
said he was tired of working seven days a week. Burnout is
common among stars. And so, consultants recommend that
companies be ready to let good people go -- temporarily. "One
of the hallmarks of the creative employers is that they are
willing to flex and bend," says Mr. Gordon. "All too often
employers let their good people walk away because they aren't
flexible." Fidelity says the company discussed many options
with Mr. Lynch, but that it "respects" his final decision to
leave.

   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Stanford University President Donald
Kennedy called for the university to make teaching, rather
than research, its top priority.
   In an annual address last week to the university's
Academic Council, Mr. Kennedy said both teaching and research
are important to the university, but "the relative weight has
shifted over time" toward research. He said Stanford
educators "need to talk about teaching more, respect and
reward those who do it well, and make it first among our
labors."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stanford needs to pay more attention to students,
particularly undergraduates, he said. There is a "suspicion
that we have lost focus in designing and delivering a well
planned, challenging and inspiring education to our
undergraduates," Mr. Kennedy said. He criticized faculty
members who reduce teaching duties to concentrate on
research, leaving "too many of Stanford's classes" taught by
visiting or temporary staffers.
   Mr. Kennedy's remarks come at a time when educators around
the nation are calling for colleges and universities to
commit more resources to students, and move away from the
"publish or perish" mentality that often results in teachers,
eager to secure tenure, emphasizing their research
activities.

   UAL'S OUTLOOK REMAINS uncertain despite Friday's agreement
to be acquired by United Air's unions for $4.38 billion. The
buy-out itself may take several more months to complete, and
much will depend on how well the unions get along among
themselves and management. Moreover, the carrier has been so
preoccupied with possible buy-outs that it has steadily lost

   On Trade Issues
   Still Faces Tests

   TOKYO -- U.S. and Japanese leaders are congratulating
themselves for their "historic" report on eliminating
"structural" causes of Japan's persistent trade surplus.
   But the reaction of Albert L. Sieg, a U.S. businessman in
Tokyo, is more subdued. "The parties have agreed at the
negotiating level," said the president of the Eastman Kodak
(Japan) Ltd. subsidiary, and a vice president of the American
Chamber of Commerce in Japan. "But we've been talking about
negotiations and commitments for a long, long time. The
question is whether there's any follow-through or not. There
isn't any reason Americans shouldn't be skeptical."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It took four days of around-the-clock bargaining last week
to produce blueprints for reforming the Japanese and U.S.
economies. But the two governments still put off until July
the key question in the minds of American government and
business veterans of the bilateral trade battle: how the
agreement will be monitored and enforced. That, they say,
will determine whether this is truly a turning point, or
largely an academic exercise.
   Japan's 32-page plan is filled with many potentially
significant promises for reform. But they are largely vague
statements about "strictly enforcing" certain laws and
"resorting to more formal actions." Many have been made
before. Even the few specific pledges, such as simplifying
Japan's contorted distribution system, face political hurdles
before they can be adopted.
   And even then, such changes can be effectively thwarted by
other measures. Less than an hour after the talks broke up in
Washington Thursday night, the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry held a news conference in Tokyo stressing
the limits of what the Japanese had promised.
   Thus, most Americans invoke the conventional wisdom that
unless the U.S. applies continual pressure, the Japanese
government won't have the power or conviction to fulfill its
promises. "It's imperative that there be a full American
staff in Tokyo with adequate authority to follow up," argues
John P. Stern, head of the American Electronics Association's
Japan office. "I'm concerned the U.S. does not have adequate
resources in Japan to monitor enforcement of the agreement."
   The document released last week was the interim report of
the Structural Impediments Initiative, sweeping discussions
born last year out of frustration with the endless
sector-specific trade haggles. The idea was to knock down
some of the systemic causes of the $49 billion bilateral
trade imbalance. Thus, the focus was on long-term reforms
that likely won't bear fruit soon, such as shifting the
orientation of Japan's economy toward consumption and away
from production. The final report is due by early July.
   On the U.S. side of the ledger, American trade officials
themselves acknowledge that most of the problems are domestic
-- a low savings rate, a high federal budget deficit and poor
public education to name a few. The structural talks are
supposed to be a "two-way street," and the plan to change the
U.S. economy, also released last week, is as vague as the
Japanese. Moreover, the reforms cited may prove even more
difficult to bring about given the political and fiscal
constraints faced by the Bush administration.
   But, as a top member of the American delegation said after
the reports were released, "one side {of the street} is
longer than the other," meaning that most of the pressure
falls on Japan.
   The Japanese plan, if totally implemented as the Americans
understand it, would mean dramatic societal changes,
essentially wresting major decisions from the big businesses
and big government that so heavily rule the economy, and
turning more control over to the free market.
   But Japan has made such pledges before. In 1986,
then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone commissioned a study
under Bank of Japan's former governor, Haruo Maekawa, which
called for "economic structural adjustment for international
harmony." That report helped trigger a major shift in the
Japanese economy from one driven by exports to one pushed by
domestic demand. Yet it failed to deliver many liberalizing
measures, some of which are repeated in last week's report.
   Many of the political obstacles to change three years ago
still exist today. The most significant proposal in Japan's
SII interim plan is an overhaul of a law protecting
inefficient mom-and-pop shops.
   The Americans say the law effectively blocks many foreign
stores from setting up in Japan, and also discourages the
opening of large Japanese stores, which are more likely to
carry imported goods. The Japanese government itself says the
law hurts consumers.
   But any talk of change irritates the politically powerful
1.6 million small retailers. "The decision will do nothing
but weaken minor retailers, devastate shopping districts, and
slow down economic and cultural development of the community,
the Federation of Specialty Stores Associations said in a
statement. The group vowed to do its best to prevent the
decisions from being enforced.
   It has many levers to pull. Some of the changes require
legislative approval, and the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, which has endorsed the package, doesn't control the
upper house of the Diet. The opposition parties may try to
grab even more of the LDP power base by promising to reject
the revisions of the law. So far, however, the opposition has
been surprisingly quiet on the SII proposals.
   The retailers say they will also appeal to local
authorities, who may have the power to enact their own
legislation effectively nullifying any change made at the
national level. A recent survey of a dozen major municipal
governments showed many would consider enacting some sort of
protection if the national changes proved damaging to small
retailers. "There's a concern that the regions will respond
by tightening laws -- they don't feel the pressure from the
U.S.," said Weeks Ringle, a retail analyst with W.I. Carr
(Overseas) Ltd., a unit of France's Banque Indosuez, in
Tokyo.
   Other reforms mentioned in the Japanese package remain
vague. The government said it would increase the penalty for
antitrust violations, but doesn't mention a number. It
promises to increase spending on public works -- a move
Americans say will shift the orientation of the economy
further away from exports and more toward domestic
consumption -- but doesn't specify by how much.
   Some of those details will likely appear in the July
report, and then give a clearer picture about how seriously
the Japanese government takes the U.S. government's demands.
   But other promises require general changes in everday
behavior and attitudes, and are almost impossible to write
into an agreement. Many of the proposals, aimed at curbing
close business ties, rely on a more vigorous Japan Fair Trade
Commission. But even increasing the staff and budget of that
bureaucracy won't guarantee that the commission, which has a
history of lax enforcement, will pursue cases Americans
consider antitrust violations. Some American businessmen fear
a tougher FTC will simply target them. Indeed, a recent JFTC
report concluded that a major cause of high prices in Japan
was high markups by importers.

   U.S., Soviets Gear Up for Summit Talks
   But Must Make Progress on Arms Issues

   WASHINGTON -- With just seven weeks to go before the May
30 U.S.-Soviet summit meeting and superpower relations
strained by the Lithuania crisis, the two sides will have to
struggle to settle the major arms-control issues they have
pledged to resolve by that conference.
   During three days of preparatory meetings here last week
between Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, little progress was made on
important strategic-arms differences that are supposed to be
overcome by the summit. Indeed, U.S. officials privately
complain that Soviet negotiators, especially those from the
military, appeared to backslide on some commitments the U.S.
thought it had won at the Baker-Shevardnadze meeting in
Moscow in February.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Soviet officials also continued to express strong
opposition to a united Germany's membership in the Western
alliance. They conceded that neutrality for Germany isn't the
only solution, but openly admitted they had no alternative
proposal for the status of Germany, leaving that issue also
in the air as the two German states race toward unification.
   But the U.S. added to the negotiators' task by floating a
new plan to eliminate some or all land-based multiple warhead
missiles in favor of less-dangerous single-warhead models.
Some elements of the ban might be included in this year's
proposed treaty, officials indicated, while others might
await a follow-up agreement. But the Soviets were cool to the
suggestion, which strongly favors the U.S. because most
American missile warheads are based on submarines, not land.
Yuriy Nazarkin, the chief Soviet strategic-arms negotiator,
publicly said such a complex new plan couldn't be worked out
in just seven weeks.
   Mr. Baker will fly to Moscow May 16 for another round of
pre-summit meetings to try and bridge the gaps. Unless that
session succeeds, the summit could come up short of the most
important goal set for it by President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev when they last met on Malta in
December: resolution of all the major issues leading to the
signing of a strategic arms reduction treaty, called Start.
   The internal Soviet crisis over Lithuania's bid for
independence has placed a chill over the whole U.S.-Soviet
relationship, which has been remarkably smooth for about a
year. The Bush administration has been forced to warn the
Soviets that any drastic crackdown there would disrupt
superpower ties. Moscow has been preoccupied with Lithuania
and anxious to look tough, just when full attention and a
willingness to compromise are required for pre-summit deal
making.
   Several senior State Department officials who participated
in the meetings last week said they had the strong feeling
that top Soviet officials, including Messrs. Shevardnadze and
Gorbachev, have been so distracted by the Lithuanian
challenge that they aren't imposing sufficient pressure on
lower-level bargainers to reach compromises. In addition,
they said they sensed a new resistance to compromise by
military officials, which they speculated might reflect a
cooling of relations between Mr. Gorbachev and the military
leadership.
   Anxious to remove Lithuania as an obstacle to superpower
progress, the U.S. has decided for now to limit itself to
stern warnings against further armed intervention there. It
continued to press for the summit and for superpower
agreements. Mr. Shevardnadze hailed the American
business-as-usual attitude, saying "when two powers, such as
the Soviet Union and the United States, continue to expand
their cooperation, even at a more difficult juncture, the
world breathes more quietly."
   Mr. Baker and President Bush urged Mr. Shevardnadze to end
the crisis by holding a referendum in Lithuania on
independence and then negotiating a peaceful economic and
territorial separation if it passes. Those proposals sound
similar to key portions of Mr. Gorbachev's proposed new
secession law and would be a much slower route to
independence than Lithuania's new non-communist leaders
originally hoped to take.
   Mr. Baker denied the U.S. was siding with Moscow in the
dispute, and said Lithuanian leaders, under Soviet armed
pressure, have said they might accept a referendum and
lengthy talks rather than insisting that their March 11
declaration of independence was the last word on the issue.
   But the impact of the Lithuania crisis pervaded last
week's meetings, especially on the Soviet side. The lack of
focus by top Soviet leaders was evident beyond armscontrol
matters, U.S. officials said, and showed itself on political
and economic issues.
   On the issue of a unified Germany, the Americans found the
Soviet position confused. Mr. Shevardnadze privately
concedes, they said, that neutrality isn't the only possible
status for Germany.
   But, at a news conference after the meetings, the Soviet
foreign minister continued to praise the longstanding Soviet
demand for a "neutral and demilitarized Germany" and strongly
rejected as "one-sided" the U.S. demand that the new Germany
belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He welcomed
alternative suggestions, but said, "I have no specific
answers or proposals at this point in time."
   Two vague ideas mentioned by Mr. Shevardnadze as worthy of
study have both been rejected in the West. One, a proposal
that Germany belong to NATO and the Warsaw Pact, was
dismissed by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl after a
meeting with President Bush in February. The other, a hazy
notion gaining popularity across Europe for a new security
alliance to replace both military pacts, was rejected by Mr.
Baker Friday as a threat to NATO.
   On economic issues, Soviet specialists confirmed during
the talks news reports that Mr. Gorbachev hopes to have ready
a radical economic program, including price and currency
reforms, by the time of the next Communist Party Congress
July 2. But the Soviets were vague about how far the package
would go and whether it would survive political attacks. The
Soviets also weren't able to guarantee passage by May 30 of a
liberalized emigration law, the key condition for waiving of
U.S. trade restrictions at the summit.
   The U.S. call for a new move against multiple-warhead
missiles is partly designed to assuage Senate Armed Services
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), who has insisted the
Bush administration pursue such curbs if it wants new missile
funding. In addition, it appears aimed at avoiding the
growing impression that the Start treaty won't drastically
cut nuclear weapons stockpiles.
   But the American plan is heavily tilted towards U.S.
interests. It would trade the fully deployed Soviet SS-24
mobile-missile system for the unbuilt rail-mounted MX
missile. It wouldn't touch the most potent new weapon in
either arsenal -- the U.S. Trident II or the D5, a
multiple-warhead submarine-based missile that is the first
sea-launched weapon to match the pinpoint accuracy of
land-based missiles.
   The key remaining differences on strategic arms control,
include limits on air and sea-launched cruise missiles. In
addition, the two sides remain far apart on a critical issue
in conventional arms control: limits on aircraft in Europe.
But the conventional arms disputes aren't scheduled to be
settled by the summit, so more time remains to resolve them.

   General Development Seeks Protection
   Under Chapter 11 as Tax Bill Comes Due

   General Development Corp., short on cash and unable to pay
its property tax bills, said it filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   The petition, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Miami, put
the Miami-based developer and certain subsidiaries under the
court's protection while the company prepares a plan of
reorganization. Not covered in the filing are the company's
Vistana Resort and Glen Ivy subsidiaries, which operate
time-share resorts in Florida and the Western U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One of Florida's largest developers, General Development
has been roiled by legal troubles. After a two-year grand
jury investigation into selling practices, the company
pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiracy to defraud
some 10,000 home buyers by charging inflated prices based on
improper appraisals. The company's former top two executives
also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy each.
   General Development said it didn't yet know what impact
the filing would have on its restitution plan in the
government's case. Under that plan, announced in March,
General Development agreed to repay homebuyers as much as
$100 million over 25 years.
   In recent months, General Development has struggled for
financial stability amid the investigation. The company first
laid off 500 workers. Then, General Development hired Charles
J. Simons, one of its outside directors and a former vice
chairman of Eastern Airlines, to succeed the two executives.
And, a week ago, the company closed its world-wide homesite
sales operations, firing 1,100 workers -- nearly one-quarter
of the payroll.
   But none of the moves could reverse the company's
financial strain. The bankruptcy-law filing "was necessary in
light of the company's inability to secure additional
financing to meet its short-term cash needs," said Mr.
Simons, the company's chairman and president.
   Last week, General Development said it couldn't complete
negotiations for a $60 million credit facility, leaving the
company unable to pay more than $10 million in property taxes
due April 1. As a result, General Development said it was
considering all options, including filing for federal
bankruptcy-law protection.
   Among the parties negotiating with General Development for
the fresh credit was Prudential Insurance Co. of America,
which holds a $75 million General Development note.
Prudential couldn't be reached yesterday to comment.
   General Development said it will prepare a plan of
reorganization to restructure debt, a process that will
likely take a number of months and will be done in
consultation with a committee of creditors. General
Development also said it asked the court for approval to pay
employees their regular paychecks.
   The company hasn't yet reported 1989 results. For the
first nine months, General Development earned $11.3 million,
or $1.08 a share, on revenue of $511.6 million.
   The bankruptcy-law filing was disclosed after the stock
market closed Friday. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading Friday, General Development fell 62.5 cents to $2.25.

   A. Copeland Enterprises Inc. said it had a net loss of

of its debt.
   The owner of Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits,
which last year acquired Church's Fried Chicken Inc. for
about $392 million, said the loss resulted primarily from
about $55.6 million in interest expense related to the
Church's purchase.

   Copeland said in New Orleans that last month it received
modifications to certain covenants in its loan agreements, a
reduction in the interest rate on its bridge loan and a
deferral of $7.5 million in bank-debt amortization due in
1990. It said it requested the changes after a deteriorating
junk-bond market prevented it from refinancing some of its
current debt with high-yield subordinated debt, as planned.

   Taxpayer Rights'
   Legislation of '88
   Gets Mixed Review

<GV>
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS)
CONGRESS (CNG)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The law enacted by Congress in 1988 to
strengthen taxpayers' rights in dealing with the Internal
Revenue Service has achieved some success, but incidents of
abuse by the powerful agency are still being reported, a
Senate panel was told Friday.
   That mixed report emerged from a Senate Finance
subcommittee hearing on how the IRS is responding to the law,
known as the Taxpayer Bill of Rights.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   IRS Commissioner Fred Goldberg said his agency fully
supports the law, and he contended that the IRS has made a
great deal of progress in improving programs dealing with
taxpayer grievances and other taxpayer services.
   "We have made progress, but we clearly need to make more
in the months and years ahead," he said. "Citizens these days
have more rights in proceedings with the IRS than they do
with any other government agency."
   But the subcommittee chairman, Sen. David Pryor, (D.,
Ark.), was skeptical. For instance, he cited claims by a
California businessman that an IRS agent there encouraged a
group of businessmen to "snitch" on competitors who cheat. "I
don't want to ever see any program established in this
country that creates an underground network of IRS spies that
encourages neighbor to turn against neighbor," the lawmaker
said.
   Mr. Goldberg said he wasn't aware of such an incident, but
he said it would be "reprehensible." The IRS commissioner
added that he would put a stop to such efforts if they exist.
   The most emotional moment in the hearings came in
testimony from a widow who told the committee that the IRS
drove her husband to take his own life after the IRS imposed
what turned out to be an unjustified lien on the couple's
property.
   In tearful testimony, Kay M. Council, a 48-year-old widow
from High Point, N.C., said her husband committed suicide in
June 1988, before the taxpayer rights legislation was passed,
so she could use the life-insurance money to fight the IRS.
She eventually won her battle when a federal court ruled that
she didn't owe a penny of the $300,000 in tax, penalties and
interest the IRS sought.
   Among other things, the 1988 law requires that the IRS
notify taxpayers earlier than it has in the past when it
intends to place liens on property; that notices of
additional taxes owed spell out the agency's claims in clear
language; and that taxpayers be notified of their rights.

   OTTAWA -- Canada's unemployment rate declined to a

lowest level since August 1981, Statistics Canada said.
   The February rate was 7.7%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The unemployment decline was attributed to a drop of
91,000 in the labor force, the sharpest decrease for any
month since July 1973. An analyst for the federal agency said
Statistics Canada wasn't certain why the labor force declined
so sharply in March.
   Full-time employment fell 47,000 in March while part-time
employment rose 16,000. Manufacturing employment declined
34,000, continuing a downward trend that started in the 1989
second quarter.

   GAO Head Says Tax Increase Is Needed
   To Pay for Cost of the Thrift Bailout

   WASHINGTON -- The head of the General Accounting Office
said a tax increase is needed to pay for the savings-and-loan
bailout, which the GAO says will cost far more than
originally forecast.
   The investigative arm of Congress said the cost over 30
years should reach $325 billion rather than the $257 billion
it previously estimated. The added costs include additional
S&amp;L insolvencies, a higher estimate of what previous bailout
deals actually cost, additional interest costs, and larger
administrative expenses. Under the current plan, most of the
costs will be borne by the taxpayer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The often-cited 10-year cost, previously estimated by the
Bush administration at $166 billion, is expected by the GAO
to be roughly $243 billion.
   The GAO report, released Friday, called for Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady to consider legislation to determine
the source of new funds and also to report current S&amp;L
restructuring costs to Congress semiannually in order to
avoid big surprises in the future.
   Yesterday on NBC's "Meet the Press," Charles Bowsher,
comptroller general, said the administration's early
estimates of the plan's costs were artificially suppressed so
that the government could appear to meet its
deficit-reduction targets.
   The higher new S&amp;L estimates could make more likely an
overall congressional budget deal to reduce the deficit,
including a tax increase. "You are still going to have to
look at the revenue side of the budget," said Mr. Bowsher,
adding that it would take more than congressional consensus.
"You have to have White House leadership," he said.
   It's impossible to know yet the final cost of the
savings-and-loan bailout, which was devised to protect
depositors in S&amp;Ls that made bad investments. The cost --
bigger than all previous U.S. bailouts of private industry or
municipal governments combined -- won't be known until the
bad investments that the S&amp;Ls made have been liquidated.
   Economists have been skeptical about the Bush
administration estimates, which projected 7% deposit growth
at a time when thrift deposits are shrinking rapidly, almost
no inflation, and no recession for 10 years. Economic
projections that are less sanguine push cost estimates even
higher.
   "If we had a strong economy working against us, interest
rates going up much higher, some people are making estimates
of half a trillion dollars" over 40 years, said Mr. Bowsher
at a Senate hearing Friday.
   The GAO, moreover, sounded an ominous warning about the
deposit insurance fund that protects banks, at a time when
banks are reporting higher losses associated with sliding
real-estate markets nationwide. The Federal Deposit Insurance
Fund reported its first loss ever in 1988 and is expected to
report another loss for 1989.
   The GAO said it is considering recommendations of
extraordinary auditing requirements, particularly for large
banks. Those would include more frequent on-site examinations
by banking regulators as well as double teams of outside
auditors. The GAO has cited past, superficial audits of S&amp;Ls
as a major factor in allowing thrift insolvencies to grow to
the present size.
   "I don't think we can afford to let much time go by before
we deal with these issues," said Donald Chapin, assistant
comptroller general.
   The higher estimates occur at a time when the
administration has been scrambling to salvage the S&amp;L
restructuring plan. So far, it has been bogged down, finding
far fewer buyers of insolvent thrifts than anticipated, as
well as more S&amp;L insolvencies with greater losses than
expected.
   Resolution Trust Corp. is gearing up to sell or liquidate
140 thrifts by July 1 -- a blistering pace compared with the
52 S&amp;Ls it has sold since last August -- by using more
flexible terms. The sales are likely to leave the government
with the bulk of bad assets for later sale. The government,
however, is likely to receive better bids from buyers for the
thrift deposits if they are sold before their value
diminishes.
   After several weeks of inactivity, several thrift sales
are expected to be announced this week, said an RTC
spokesman.

   Poindexter Verdict Supports Contention
   Of a High-Level Iran-Contra Cover-Up

   WASHINGTON -- The conviction of former National Security
Adviser John Poindexter on all five felony charges vindicated
Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh's allegation that the
attempted Iran-Contra cover-up reached into the highest
levels of the Reagan administration.
   Mr. Poindexter, a retired Navy rear admiral who counseled
the former president daily in late 1985 and 1986, was the
most senior Reagan administration official tried and
convicted on charges of concealing U.S. arms sales to Iran
and White House support for the Nicaraguan rebels during that
period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A federal court jury here returned guilty verdicts
Saturday on one count of conspiracy with former national
security aide Oliver North and others to obstruct Congress,
two separate counts of obstruction, and two counts of making
false statements -- all in connection with concealing Reagan
administration dealings either with the Contras or with Iran.
   The prosecution charged that Mr. Poindexter coordinated a
White House cover-up of arms supplies to the Nicaraguan
insurgency, which had been banned by Congress, and an
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran, which Mr. Reagan had
publicly denied.
   After the verdict, Dan Webb, the independent counsel's
lead trial lawyer, said, "High men in government office who
have the responsibility for the security of this nation ought
not to be allowed to commit crimes to pursue their own
self-interest." Mr. Webb had contended that Mr. Poindexter
deliberately misled Congress to protect the Reagan
administration from political embarrassment.
   Mr. Poindexter's lawyer, Richard Beckler, said the
defendant would appeal the conviction. Mr. Poindexter didn't
testify in his own defense at the trial.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene set June 11 as the date
for sentencing Mr. Poindexter, who is 53 years old. The
maximum sentence would be 25 years in prison and fines
totaling $1.25 million. None of the other six men convicted
on charges related to the Iran-Contra affair have been
sentenced to serve any prison time, let alone receive the
maximum sentences possible under law.
   Three Iran-Contra prosecutions are pending, including Mr.
North's appeal of his conviction. It isn't clear whether Mr.
Walsh intends to bring any new indictments related to the
affair.
   Mr. North, a close Poindexter associate in the biggest
presidential scandal since Watergate, ironically became the
prosecution's main witness. Though reluctant to implicate his
former boss, Mr. North nevertheless confirmed the
prosecution's central allegations when confronted with his
own testimony from prior legal proceedings. For example, he
testified that he saw Mr. Poindexter tear in half a
potentially embarrassing document in which Mr. Reagan had
authorized a 1985 U.S.-Iran arms transfer as an
arms-for-hostages deal.
   The court-appointed independent counsel, Mr. Walsh, had
previously dropped the central conspiracy and theft charges
against both Messrs. Poindexter and North because of concerns
over the disclosure of classified government information.
   The Poindexter trial contributed only a handful of
insights into the tangled events surrounding secret Reagan
administration activities abroad. The more significant
tidbits of information came from the videotaped testimony of
Mr. Reagan, who was called as a defense witness. The former
president confirmed for the first time that his
administration offered financial incentives in 1985 to at
least one friendly third country, Honduras, to encourage
military support for the Contras. President Bush, who was
vice president at the time, has repeatedly denied that there
were any such "quid pro quos."
   On the whole, the courtroom strategies of the prosecution
and defense precluded any startling discoveries. Mr. Webb
attempted to compact complicated secret transactions and
relationships to fit the narrow charges against Mr.
Poindexter. The prosecutor further narrowed his case by
dropping some 10 witnesses he had considered calling after
Mr. North provided his damaging testimony.
   The defense, in contrast, took a scattershot approach,
frequently switching subjects in an attempt to create an
impression of a diligent, honest military man. Mr. Beckler
rarely disputed the facts asserted by the prosecution,
choosing instead to stress Mr. Poindexter's relationship with
former President Reagan.

   SAN DIEGO -- Financially troubled Computer &amp;
Communications Technology Corp. said it agreed in principle
to merge with closely held Sunward Technologies, resulting in
new, 55% majority control of the company by Sunward
shareholders.
   Computer &amp; Communications Technology also disclosed that
it has technically defaulted on $8.7 million of debt and that
it expects to report a $12.4 million fourth-quarter loss,
largely because of one-time charges.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue for the latest quarter was about $17.6 million.
The loss for 1989 totals about $17.3 milllion on revenue of
$61.5 million, the company said.
   The proposed merger is subject to shareholder and bank
approval. Both companies make magnetic recording heads for
computer disk drives and jointly represent about 40% of the
world-wide non-captive market for such products, said Gary
Hall, chief financial officer of Computer &amp; Communications
Technology. Both companies are based in San Diego.
   The merged company will adopt the Sunward Technologies
name. However, Computer &amp; Communications, technically the
continuing entity, will issue 14.5 million new shares to
Sunward holders. Computer &amp; Communications Technology
currently has about 11.3 million shares outstanding.
   Everett Bahre, chairman, president, and chief executive
officer of Computer Communications &amp; Technology, said the
merger will "substantially reduce manufacturing and operating
expenses" as well as add about $6.5 million of cash at
Sunward to the combined balance sheet. Sunward had revenue
last year of $42.1 million.
   Sunward has manufacturing operations in the Philippines,
and about 1,500 employees. Computer Communications &amp;
Technology, with manufacturing operations in South Korea and
Puerto Rico, has about 2,000 employees.

   NEW YORK -- KeyCorp expects to report first-quarter
earnings of 83 cents to 88 cents a share, generally in line
with securities analysts' estimates.
   Earnings rose about 17% from last year's first-quarter
results of 72 cents a share, or $31 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   William H. Dougherty, chief financial officer of the
Albany, N.Y.-based banking company, said in an interview, "We
will be comfortably within the range of analysts' estimates."
Mr. Dougherty said the improved results will come from
operations and not from nonrecurring items, except for a
small gain on the sale of securities.
   For the full year, he said that KeyCorp earnings will be
"at the lower end" of the $3.60 to $3.70-a-share range of
analysts' estimates, as a result of the less robust economic
environment and harsh regulatory climate. Last year, KeyCorp
had earnings of $136.9 million, or $3.20 a share.
   "We decided that it would not be wise to be pushing hard
to increase loan demand in this environment," Mr. Dougherty
said.
   Nonperforming loans, he added, are expected to rise
slightly to 1.55% of total loans from 1.45% at the end of
1989.
   Mr. Dougherty said KeyCorp's Maine bank recently was
examined by bank regulators and that "no adjustments
whatsoever" were made to the bank's portfolio of problem
loans.
   At its Alaska bank, nonperforming assets will fall to 8%
from its peak of 12%. "Alaska has bottomed out, and we will
be reporting a profit in Alaska this year," Mr. Dougherty
said.
   In addition, Mr. Dougherty said KeyCorp has a small
exposure in real estate, a problem area for many banks. Out
of a loan portfolio totaling $9.9 billion at year end,
condominium and construction loans total only $56 million and
$438 million, respectively, he said.

   Tokyo Stock Prices Surge on Bargain-Hunting

   Active bargain-hunting pushed up Tokyo stock prices across
the board Friday, with the Nikkei index surging more than
1,000 points to close above the 29000-point level for the
first time since March 30.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 1,029.72
points to close at its intraday high of 29278.78. The index
declined 193.88 points Thursday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Nikkei, after surging during the first hour of the
morning session, drifted at higher levels the rest of the
day.
   Traders said investors bought aggressively, deciding that
stock prices had fallen as far as they were going to when the
Nikkei fell as low as 27251 points intraday Thursday, down
30% since the beginning of this year.
   Buying interest was also supported by the relative
stability of the yen and bond prices Friday, traders said.
The market also welcomed the progress made at the fourth
round of the U.S.-Japan Structural Impediments Initiative
(SII) talks, which closed in Washington Thursday.
   In Monday morning trading, the Nikkei rose sharply in
response to the yen's solid gains in foreign-exchange
markets. At the close of the morning session, the index
finished at 30165.45, up 886.67 points, or 3%, from Friday's
close.
   Volume on the first section Friday was estimated at 800
million shares, up from 658 million Thursday. Friday was the
first time since Dec. 27 that daily volume reached the 800
million-share level.
   A total of 732 issues advanced, while 75 issues fell and
30 remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the first section, which lost 17.14 points Thursday, was
up 90.44 points, or 4.39%, to close at 2149.26.
   The second section index, which plunged 176.70 points
Thursday, gained 77.65 points, or 2.29%, to close at 3391.57.
Volume in the second section was estimated at 13 million
shares, up from 7.5 million Thursday.
   The market's strong advance Thursday afternoon from a
1,200-point intraday loss continued to provide a bullish mood
to the market Friday.
   Participants said, however, the market hasn't fully
discredited rumors that financially troubled speculator
groups have defaulted on payments to brokerage houses. The
rumors were the major factor behind Thursday's mid-day
plunge.
   "Investors are still feeling that their fears may come
true in the near future," said Fumihiko Ishii, manager of
investment research at Nomura Securities.
   That's part of the reason investors hurried to buy Friday,
when prices were low, so that they can take profits in the
near future.
   Mr. Ishii said Friday's gains were a technical rebound in
response to overselling over the past month.
   The largest winners were spread among the steel, mining,
construction and textile sectors.
   Nippon Steel went up 45 yen (29 cents) to 585 yen ($3.72),
while Mitsubishi Mining rose 90 to 660.
   Buying lifted both large and mid-sized construction
companies. Taisei gained 70 to 1,190. Sumitomo Construction
advanced 109 to 1,010 and Tokyu Construction was up 119 at
1,050.
   Electric utilities also rose sharply. Tokyo Electric Power
increased 250 to 3,980.
   Some pharmaceutical companies attracted investors who
considered their earnings prospects strong because they are
expected to unveil new products.
   Sankyo gained 170 to 2,600, while Mochida surged 400 to
3,800.
   London share prices finished lower Friday, as a
late-afternoon slide on the back of worries before the
weekend's Group of Seven (G-7) meeting in Paris took its toll
on the market.
   Traders also said worries about the future viability of
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government upset
the market, and particularly the recently privatized
companies.
   In a Gallup poll published Friday, the Labor party had
52.5% support of those polled, and now holds a record
24.5-point lead over the Conservative party.
   Sterling's late-afternoon tumble also unnerved the market,
as internationals came in for a bout of selling, dealers
said. Market watchers said the G-7 meeting wasn't expected to
focus on the pound, so there were perceptions that sterling
would be neglected in the aftermath of the meeting.
   At the close, the broad-based Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was down 18.4 points at 2221.1, and
just a shade better than its 2221 minimum. The index hit an
early-morning peak of 2243.2 and proceeded to move lower
throughout the rest of the session.
   The narrower FT 30-share index was down 16.1 points at
1740.2. Volume amounted to a moderately active 578.6 million
shares, compared with the 499.5 million that changed hands
Thursday.
   In the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
closed at 2242.0, down from its settlement level of 2271.0
Thursday.
   Wall Street, if anything, provided an additional negative
bias for London stocks, dealers said. By the end of the
European day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 15.54
points at 2705.63.
   The opinion polls hit the privatization stocks. Thames
Water dropped 4 pence (7 cents) to 138 ($2.27), and the
package of water stocks shed 38 to #14.50 ($23.82). British
Telecom lost 2.5 to 263.5, while British Gas slipped .5 to
205.
   Among the internationals that were unhinged by political
events and a weakness in sterling were Glaxo Holdings, off 13
to 785; Imperial Chemical Industries, down 11 to #10.84; BOC
Group, off 9 to 520, and British Aerospace, down 9 to 519.
   Elsewhere around the market, diversified conglomerate
B.A.T Industries shed 42 to 743 as the spinoff of its retail
company, Argos, began official trading on the London Stock
Exchange. Argos's debut, however, was less than stellar and
its shares dropped 2 to 202.
   Elsewhere, stock prices closed higher in Paris, Zurich,
Stockholm and Milan; mixed in Brussels and lower in
Frankfurt. The Johannesburg stock exchange was closed for a
holiday.
   Share prices closed higher in Sydney, Seoul and
Wellington, were mixed in Hong Kong and Manila and lower in
Singapore and Taipei.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each

   OTC Focus:
   Market's Volume Is Often Overstated
   In Double and Triple Counting of Trades

   NEW YORK -- Looks aren't everything in the
over-the-counter market. Scratch beneath the surface on any
trading day and you'll find that what you see isn't exactly
what happened.
   For instance, the OTC market's overall volume is
frequently overstated. There is "double counting" and even
"triple counting" of stock trades. Less often, closing prices
of thinly traded stocks suggest a big swing up or down when
there really isn't any change in the range of prices that
buyers and sellers are willing to accept.

   "As a rule of thumb, we assume the actual trading volume
of a stock is two-thirds of the reported volume," says
Lawrence Auriana, a portfolio manager of the $37-million
Kaufmann Fund, which invests in small growth companies for
individual investors.
   The New York and American stock exchanges also sometimes
have discrepancies between actual and reported volume and
prices. But it happens far less often -- a fact exchanges
sometimes exploit as they compete for business with the
growing OTC market.
   The OTC market's oddities are old hat to the pros. But
small investors need to be aware of them, too. "It's just the
reality of the marketplace," says portfolio manager Morris
Smith of Fidelity Investments, who in May will leave the helm
of the $720 million Fidelity OTC fund to succeed Peter Lynch
as manager of the $13 billion Magellan Fund.
   Here's a rundown of some eccentricities of the OTC market:
   The middlemen's role: Volume can be misleading because of
the multiple-dealer trading network used in the OTC market.
Buyers and sellers meet and negotiate prices through
brokerage companies' "market makers," who communicate by
telephone and electronically. There are at least several --
occasionally dozens of -- OTC market makers for each stock,
rather than the single floor "specialist" assigned to an
exchange-listed security.
   OTC bid and ask prices are posted and trades are executed
through the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotations system, or Nasdaq. Sometimes a broker
will act as a client's agent, telling his company's trading
desk to go into the market to buy or sell an OTC stock. More
often, if a company makes a market in an OTC stock it will
simply buy or sell that stock itself.
   By contrast, on an exchange, specialists usually don't
need to buy and hold stock until a purchaser appears. The
exchange floor functions more like an auction house, with
brokers physically present to convey their terms to the
single specialist in a particular stock. The specialist acts
like an umpire to maintain an orderly market, keeping an
order book to match up buyers and sellers.
   "Double counting." About 85% to 90% of OTC trading goes
through a dealer, according to Gene L. Finn, chief economist
for the NASD, the self-regulatory body that runs Nasdaq.
Under NASD rules, each seller must report its trade, and this
can lead to "double counting" of volume.
   For example, suppose Jill Investor wants to sell 5,000
shares of the fictional Everglow Utilities. Her account
executive at EastCoast Securities sends an order ticket to
the company's OTC trading department, which makes a market in
Everglow. It turns out that the department has a client, Jack
Investor, who wants to buy the shares. So EastCoast buys the
shares and then sells them to Jack. Volume: 10,000 shares
(the 5,000 EastCoast sold to Jack, plus the same 5,000 it
bought from Jill).
   "Triple counting." Suppose EastCoast doesn't have any
clients interested in Everglow shares. The company then finds
another dealer, Midwest Market Makers, ready to step up and
buy the stock. Midwest calls up Frank Investor and interests
him in the shares. Frank agrees to buy, and another
5,000-share trade is reported. Total volume: 15,000 shares
(5,000 from Jill to EastCoast, the same 5,000 from EastCoast
to Midwest, the same 5,000 from Midwest to Frank).
   Price anomalies. The closing price reported each day is
the last trade -- whether it occurs at the highest "bid" or
the lowest "asking" price. With thinly traded stocks, there
can be a difference -- a "spread" in trading jargon -- of 3/4
point or more between the highest bid and lowest ask being
quoted. OTC stocks with more competition among buyers and
sellers typically have smaller spreads of 1/8 to 1/4.
   Let's say the highest bid quoted for Everglow is 18 1/4
and the lowest "ask" 19. If today's final trade occurs at the
highest quoted bid -- say, 18 1/4 from Jack -- the closing
price will be shown as 18 1/4. But suppose that tomorrow the
quoted bid-and-ask range for Everglow remains the same and
the final trade occurs at Midwest's asking price of 19. On
paper, the stock now has closed up 3/4.
   Volume is a concern mainly for big institutions, which
must worry about whether a particular investment pool is big
enough for them to swim in. "The individual will be able to
buy and sell 100 shares or 1,000 shares in all but the
smallest companies," says Elliott Schlang, executive vice
president of Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, Cleveland.
   The American Stock Exchange runs a distant third behind
Nasdaq in terms of reported volume of stocks traded. But Amex
President Kenneth Leibler says the reporting discrepancies
make it difficult to compare the two markets. "Whenever I
look at the OTC market, I automatically halve the volume," he
says, though he calls the OTC system "the most efficient way
to report . . . given the structure of their market."
   In wooing new clients, Mr. Leibler argues that the public
auction system provides greater ease in trading securities
than the OTC market's multiple dealers. But Mr. Auriana of
Kaufmann Fund bet differently last year. "We feel very
strongly there's less volatility on Nasdaq, because you have
a fairly large number of firms making markets," he says. Last
year the fund encouraged T2 Medical Inc. to delist its Class
A shares from the Amex and trade on Nasdaq instead. The
company accounts for 12% of Kaufmann's $37 million portfolio.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Declining software stocks helped push down the Nasdaq
Composite Index by 2.52, or 0.58%, to 430.90 on a day when
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index eased only 0.2%.
OTC advancers trailed decliners, 874 to 1,031.
   National Market System volume totaled 102,138,400 shares,
about even with Thursday's 102,057,100 shares.
   Oracle Systems dropped 1 1/2 to 16 1/8, a 52-week low.
Angry shareholders have sued the company alleging that it
misled them regarding fiscal third-quarter earnings. A late
March disclosure about the quarter previously sank the stock
30% in one day.
   Novell tumbled 4 1/8 to 38 3/4 though the company said it
had agreed to be acquired by Lotus Development in a stock
swap. Lotus slid 2 to 34 1/4. Microsoft lost 1/4 to 114 1/4
and Ashton-Tate fell 5/8 to 12 1/2.
   Bank stocks nationwide got hammered on continuing concerns
over weakening loan portfolios. The Nasdaq 100 Index, which
tracks the biggest OTC technology stocks among other
non-financial issues, lost 3.10, or 0.72%, to 425.02. But the
Nasdaq Financial 100 Index, including the largest unlisted
bank stocks, tumbled 4.65, or 1.2%, to 379.84.
   Sun Microsystems was also on the most active list, down
5/8 to 22 following its call for the redemption or conversion
of its 5 1/4% convertible debentures. Conversion should
result in the issuance of as many as five million new shares.
   Hotelecopy gained 1 to 9 1/2. William K. Woodruff &amp; Co.
initiated coverage of the company with a "buy"
recommendation. Hotelecopy, based in Miami, provides
telephone facsimile services in about 1,800 hotels
nationwide. The company also recently began offering
self-service credit card-operated fax service in post office
lobbies throughout the U.S.
