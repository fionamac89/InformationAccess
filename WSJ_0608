   Grain Futures Prices Surge as Rain in Midwest
   Bars Planting, Bringing Cut in Acreage Forecast

   CHICAGO -- Relentless rain in the southern Midwest,
coupled with new export demand, drove grain futures prices
strongly higher.
   Many areas of southern Illinois, Indiana and Ohio -- which
have been inundated with rain in the past 30 days -- got more
than an inch of rain overnight Wednesday, and more was
expected last night.

   The wet weather has kept many farmers from finishing their
corn planting. Conventional wisdom calls for farmers to plant
all their corn within the first week of June for maximum
yields and to shift unplanted corn fields to soybeans after
that. AgResource Co. of Chicago said it reduced its planting
estimate for corn from 76 million acres to between 73.5 and
74 million acres and may reduce it again today if the rains
continue.
   The rain and cool temperatures also have inhibited growth
in what farmers have managed to plant, resulting in shallow
root development in the young corn crop, analysts said.
Weather forecasters now expect a high-pressure ridge to move
into the western corn belt soon, bringing hot, dry conditions
that could damage the fragile plants.
   Corn futures helped set the pace at the Chicago Board of
Trade as the July contract rose 5 1/2 cents a bushel to
settle at $2.8550.
   "We think weather becomes increasingly important as the
crop gets into its development stage, and it's likely that
corn futures will continue their rally," said Daniel Basse,
director of market research for AgResource.
   Soybean and related futures contracts also rose, both in
sympathy with corn and on expectations that Pakistan will
order 90,000 metric tons of soybean oil under the Food For
Peace program, analysts said. The July soybean oil contract,
which at one point was up by its one-cent-a-pound limit,
settled just shy of that at 24.42 cents a pound, up 0.97
cent.
   "Soybean oil traded over some very key resistance
patterns," said Steve Freed, senior grain analyst for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. "In general, people think that beans
have turned the corner and bounced off their lows."
   Though beans can be planted later than corn, it's starting
to get late for bean planting as well, analysts said, and any
reduction in estimates of bean crop yields would drive prices
up.
   Wheat futures prices also rose, in part because the Soviet
Union was offered two million metric tons of export bonus
wheat, Mr. Basse of AgResource said. Weather also is a factor
for wheat, as the possibility of hot, dry conditions in the
Plains states threatens crops there.
                                                                                                       

   ENERGY: Crude oil prices plunged in the final hour of a
volatile session in which edgy traders bid prices up or down
on the smallest of news events. Triggering the late sell-off
was a report that Exxon Corp. would reopen a refinery and
terminal in Linden, N.J., this month. The facilities were
closed early this year after a number of oil spills.
Presumably, the reopening of the refinery would add to the
already large gasoline inventories. Gains in gasoline prices
earlier had boosted crude contracts. Crude for July delivery
ended on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $16.67 a barrel,
down 25 cents. It had traded as high as $17.32 during the
session. Unleaded gasoline for July delivery wound up at
57.61 cents a gallon, down 0.75 cent.
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices ended lower but partly
recovered from early declines. Gold for August delivery
finished with a loss of $2.90 an ounce at $358.10. July
silver was off 2.3 cents an ounce at $5.04. July platinum
declined $1.90 an ounce to $487.50. Japanese and Middle
Eastern selling of gold bullion combined to depress prices
early in the day, an analyst said. But the Middle Eastern
selling, which took place in Europe, didn't involve the large
quantities that caused prices to plunge twice recently, he
said. The soon-to-expire June contract, which reflected cash
market dealings, at one point fell as low as $352.10 an
ounce, off $5.30 from Wednesday's close, and August, the most
actively traded month, fell to another life-of-contract low
of $355.50. Reports of political unrest in the Soviet Union
played a role in the decline, as did concern that shortages
of foreign exchange in the Soviet Union and South Africa
could cause those nations to become more aggressive sellers
of gold. The analyst said that with Europe approaching its
summer vacation period, it's not likely to show the kind of
active demand that would be needed to boost prices. But
Richard Band, editor of Profitable Investing, a newsletter in
Potomac, Md., said: "I found it encouraging that gold came
back a bit from its early lows. This is a typical pattern of
a market nearing its bottom; it absorbs a lot of European
selling, then ends up moderately off the lows."
                                                                                                       

   COTTON: Futures prices were mixed, with the July contract
declining and new-crop months from October onward rising in
response to weather problems affecting the early part of the
next crop. July cotton, the last remaining current-crop
contract, ended with a loss of 0.26 cent a pound at 80.84
cents. Prices weakened as speculators and computer-driven
commodity funds sold the July contract after it traded above
a key resistance level and rose as high as 81.25 cents. When
it fell to a low of 79.80 cents, the selling waned and the
contract started to recover. The later contracts, for cotton
harvested in the 1990-91 season that will begin Aug. 1,
posted gains of between 0.35 cent and 1.13 cents a pound.
Demand was triggered by problems in unirrigated areas of the
Rio Grande Valley in Texas. Those areas haven't had any rain
in the past week and a half, and temperatures have soared, an
analyst said. The Rio Grande crop is important because it is
the first U.S. cotton harvested in the new season -- actually
beginning in July -- and so provides a continuity of supply,
tiding industry over from the old crop to the new one, the
analyst said.

   Golf: Allah Be With You on This Course

   Medinah, Ill. -- Medinah Country Club was founded by
Shriners, an offshoot of the Masonic movement whose idea of
fun involved things Levantine, if not elephantine. In the
1920s, when they built a three-golf-course playground in this
western suburb of Chicago, they gave it a clubhouse with a
dome like a mosque, carved camel-shaped sand traps into
fairways (one survives), and affixed a sign reading "Allah Be
With You" to the exit side of the front gate.
   Next Thursday, when the U.S. Open golf tournament tees off
in this piece of the Middle East in the Middle West, the
competitors may find themselves wishing the sign were turned
around. They'll need all the help they can get before they
enter the place.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Medinah's No. 3 Course, golfdom's sheiks will be facing
a course that has daunted their fellows for decades. Anyone
coming here with notions of parboiling par will have fizz in
his fez, and thoughts of scores deep into the 60s are
downright Saheresy. Red numbers on the leader boards should
be as rare as Red Label in Riyadh, birdies as scarce as
springs in the Sinai, eagles as elusive as . . . OK, I'll
quit.
   But you get the idea. Two other U.S. Opens have been held
here -- in 1949 and 1975 -- and nobody broke the then-par of
284 over 72 holes in either. The course was extensively
altered in 1986, but lost none of its sting. When it hosted
the U.S. Senior Open in 1988, the average 18-hole score in a
field that included such olden goldies as Gary Player, Arnold
Palmer, Bruce Crampton and Bob Charles, was 78, more than six
shots above the new par of 72.
   A story has it that a bedraggled Senior Open contestant,
whose identity changes with the telling, asked a marshal on
one hole to point out the ladies' tees. "You're playing 'em,"
the marshal replied. The course for that event was charitably
set at 6,881 yards, 314 shorter than it will play next week.
   The really interesting thing is that Medinah's members can
-- and sometimes do -- play No. 3 longer than the U.S. Golf
Association, which sponsors the Open, has decreed for the
tournament; it measures 7,366 yards from the way-back tees.
Additionally, Medinah had to widen a couple of fairways for
the fest at the USGA's request, took a nasty hump out of one
green and trimmed many of the layout's 10,000 or so trees.
   The course that will be golf's Mecca next week originally
measured a modest 6,215 yards, and was designed for women
members of the club. Its architect was Chicagoan Tom
Bendelow, whose main reputation was for productivity; he put
his signature on about 650 courses in a 30-plus year career,
staking some layouts in a single day.
   Bendelow took more time with Medinah No. 3, and it is
regarded as his jewel, but this could have been inadvertent
because it was immediately apparent that it was too tough for
its intended users. The club turned over another of its
courses to the ladies, and began lengthening and
strengthening No. 3 for championship play.
   That they did well was attested by the winning scores in
the three Western Opens and two U.S. Opens played here, the
best being Jackie Cupit's 281 in the 1962 Western. Cary
Middlecoff, the golfing dentist, put first- and last-round
75s around a 67 and 69 to win the '49 Open at 286 by a stroke
over Sam Snead and Clayton Heafner. In 1975, Lou Graham and
John Mahaffey tied for the 72-hole lead at 287 after several
better-known players, including Jack Nicklaus and Ben
Crenshaw, played themselves out of contention on the last
nine holes. Graham captured the 18-hole playoff, 71-73.
   Before it could land this year's Open, though, Medinah had
to meet a USGA demand that it build a new 18th hole that
could accommodate the big grandstands modern professional
golf requires. The club wound up spending $1.2 million on a
thorough-going renovation that scrambled several holes on its
back nine, changed the 14th hole from a 326-yard par four to
a 545-yard par five, and added a new 17th hole as well as a
new 18th.
   Everyone claims to be delighted with the changes with one
exception -- their effects on the former 17th hole. This is
the heavily trapped, across-water par three that has been
called one of the toughest single-shot holes in golf. Snead
bogeyed 17 in the final round of the 1949 Open to foreclose
what would be his last strong chance at the one major title
that always eluded him, and Crenshaw dunked his tee shot into
Lake Kadijah there (named for Mohammed's wife) to spoil his
'75 bid.
   Old 17 is the 13th hole of Medinah's rebuilt back nine,
and still is formidable. But position counts in golf as in
life generally, and it probably won't be as pivotal in the
tourney's outcome this time around.
   Medinah No. 3 fits the pattern of recent U.S. Open courses
in that it's very long (7,195 yards) with smallish, very fast
greens, and its tree-lined fairways will put an additional
premium on driving accuracy. According to host-pro Mike
Harrigan, it also deserves respect for subtlety.
   The three holes Harrigan picks as the layout's toughest
share that characteristic. No. 12, a narrow, 462-yard par
four, has water hard on the right, but he suggests that
players cling to that side nonetheless because it affords
superior access to the green. At the 199-yard, par-three
13th, the nasty former 17th, the lake often frightens players
into using too much club, but Harrigan counsels against this
because it's better to miss short of the steeply
back-to-front sloping green than into the big trap behind it,
facing (aaargh]) downhill.
   The last of Harrigan's terrible trio is 16, a wooded,
436-yard par four that's a sharp dogleg left. Big hitters, he
says, will be tempted to fly some trees and cut the dogleg,
but that's a no-no because "from the tee you can't see the
trees behind the trees." Play right, use a longer iron second
shot, and take a par any way you can get it, he advises.
   "In fact," he adds, "that last point's good advice on any
hole here."

   Large Retailers Were Hurt Last Month

   Cold, wet weather damped May sales for many of the
nation's largest retailers, which may now be forced to slash
prices on slow-moving summer clothes.
   Sales in May rose an average of about 3.5% from
year-earlier results, falling short of year-to-date gains of
about 5%. But analysts blamed bad weather in the East and
Midwest in the second half of the month, rather than a
significant change in consumer-spending habits, for the
disappointing numbers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It has been a mediocre environment," declared Edward
Weller of Montgomery Securities. "Warmer weather in February
and March led some observers to believe the underlying
strength of the consumer was greater than it is. . . . Now it
looks worse because of weather-inhibited sales."
   Mr. Weller added that he expects spending to remain weak
because of the thrift crisis and sluggish demand for durable
goods.
   The unseasonably cold weather hurt May sales of bathing
suits, shorts and other summer clothes as well as lumber,
patio and barbecue supplies, gardening equipment and air
conditioners, the analysts said.
   If the weather doesn't break soon, consumers could find
big bargains. "Markdowns will begin by the third week in June
if sales trends haven't changed," predicted Barry Bryant of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Such markdowns would depress
retailers' second-quarter profits.
   Indeed, some analysts started cutting their Gap Inc.
forecasts yesterday, sending the specialty retailer's stock
tumbling $4.375 to close at $58.50 in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. Although Gap reported a
respectable 6% gain in May sales at stores open at least a
year, the chain had planned for a bigger increase. Limited
Inc. shares also fell on news that it posted a 6% gain in
same-store sales, closing at $47.375, down $1.875, in Big
Board composite trading. Analysts said investors were
disappointed by soft same-store stores at the company's key
Limited division.
   Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., a rapidly growing
discounter, continued to outpace its rivals with an 11% gain
in same-store sales.
   Other big retailers didn't fare as well. Sears, Roebuck &amp;
Co. and K mart Corp. each said same-store sales rose a meager
0.9%. And at J.C. Penney Co., comparable-store sales gained
only 1%. Dayton Hudson Corp.'s same-store sales rose 4.2%.
Its Mervyn's stores and Target discount division more than
compensated for a weather-related 4% decline in same-store
sales at its department stores in the upper Midwest.
   Same-store sales rose 4% at May Department Stores Co., 3%
at Woolworth Corp.'s U.S. divisions and 2.2% at Carter Hawley
Hale Stores Inc. Mercantile Stores Co. reported a 1% increase
in same-store sales, while Hills Department Stores Inc. said
same-store sales fell 4.1%.
   Same-store sales, meanwhile, rose 9.5% at Neiman Marcus
Group Inc., a specialty-store chain with a big presence in
the West, where bad weather wasn't a factor.

   Architecture: Designs for Living, Dog-Style

   New York -- Anybody who believes architecture is going to
the dogs need look no further than the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
Beginning today, the former Carnegie mansion's garden will
display two dozen model residences -- all designed for
occupants of the four-pawed variety.
   "We were interested in how something as out-of-the-way as
the doghouse could illuminate the design process," says Ralph
Caplan, a design consultant who helped select the submissions
to be constructed as well as wrote the entertaining
accompanying brochure. "And the exhibit is a reminder that
design has as much to do with the ordinary as with the
lofty."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Indeed "The Doghouse" (on view here through Oct. 14) shows
remarkably diverse -- and often ingenious -- approaches to
this relatively humble design problem. As different as
Maltese and mastiffs, the structures range from a Mayan
temple made of dog biscuits to a "Bauwauhaus" built on an
overturned Breuer table. There are nostalgic houses like
Charles W. Moore's copper-roofed barn, and deconstructivist
ones like Donna Selene Seftel's, which explodes the box into
four interlockable units. There's a garden bench with canine
quarters below, a portable "Pup Tent," even a "K-9 Club Car"
-- which looks an awful lot like a hot-dog cart.
   But there's more to this show than meets the eye.
Co-sponsored by a prominent guide-dog school, Guiding Eyes
for the Blind Inc., the exhibit marks the beginning of the
Cooper-Hewitt's effort to become more accessible to the
visually impaired. Architects invited to submit plans were
encouraged to consider the needs of this audience in addition
to those of the canine "clients." The doghouses are arranged
along specially designed paths with Braille labels. And
during the show there will be weekly tours of the mansion for
the blind and visually impaired.
   Particularly responsive to this challenge is "The
All-Seeing `Eye' Doghouse" by Paul Haigh, both of whose
parents are blind. When the dog enters the sleek structure,
topped by a hieroglyphic eye, wind chimes signal his
presence. Flaplike "petting panels" labeled in Braille are
cut into the walls. For added nonvisual appeal, the house is
built from aromatic cedar.
   The flea-fighting wood also lines Ronald G. Chung's witty
"Don't Fence Me In." You could call the Berkeley architect's
creation a hole in the wall -- the hidden house is entered
through a dog-inviting gap in the picket-fence facade.
   The exhibit's pooch de resistance is Lew Davis and William
H. Paxson's "The Trojan Dog." It's literally a dog house -- a
wooden shelter shaped like a 4 1/2-foot hound. This dog all
but begs to be petted, from his floppy movable ears down to
his claw feet. About the only thing visually impaired
visitors will miss is the charming Egyptian-style dog frieze
ringing the body.
   What its creators hope won't be overlooked is "The Trojan
Dog's" somewhat hidden message. Harking back to the
structure's mythological inspiration, the wooden horse used
to penetrate the walls of Troy, Mr. Davis says: "Here we have
a Trojan dog that symbolically represents an assault on the
barriers that still have to be broken down between disabled
people and the rest of society."
   Another amusing structure with a serious side is "Lassie
Come Home," by Tucker Viemeister and associates. Real-life
Rin Tin Tins can find refuge in this recycled TV console --
complete with built-in picture window. "We think there are
already too many products so we wanted to use something that
was out there," Mr. Viemeister says. "And what epitomizes the
wasteland more than a junked TV set?"
   During the dog days ahead it would be hard to beat Lee H.
Skolnick's "Lap Dog Pool House." The shelter here is pretty
bare-bones -- a red corrugated metal triangle set into a
white-shingled wall -- but the amenities are posh. There's an
astroturf-covered sundeck, a bone-shaped weather vane and, of
course, a pool.
   Some of the structures are more appealing in theory than
practice, an architectural problem that extends far beyond
doghouses. For instance, the idea behind Robin Parkinson's
spiraling design -- the circular path dogs take before lying
down -- is considerably more interesting than the stark
metallic teepee that resulted. Ms. Seftel's four-component
"DogMA Doghouse," a spatial exploration inspired by the
Japanese word "ma" (or "space in-between"), is nothing if not
clever: There's a dog-shaped feeding dish for the
"dog-eat-dog world" area, a skylight for gazing at the Dog
Star, etc. But the Great Dane-sized explanatory plaque makes
it all seem too, well, dogmatic.
   No one is likely to pick that bone with Peter Pennoyer's
"Dog House for Small Dogs." From the 6 1/2-foot tower's
bone-shaped supporting columns to its crowning
doggie-detailed clock, this is a whimsical winner. The
architect explains the design was shaped by his in-house
consultants, a pair of miniature longhaired dachshunds: "I
find little dogs often want more attention than big dogs."
   So, how did they like the result? "When I put a bone
inside they decided it was a pretty good place to be," Mr.
Pennoyer says. "But being New York City dogs, they prefer
upholstered furniture."

   U.S. Banks Slip Further Behind Rivals
   ---
   Curbs on Activities Hamper
   Efforts to Stay Competitive

   SAN FRANCISCO -- The last time the International Monetary
Conference held its annual meeting here, in 1976, 56 U.S.
banks were members. Now, 35 are.
   In his opening remarks this week to top executives from
the industrial world's leading banks, Rainer Gut, chairman of
Credit Suisse, made a second telling -- and, to Americans,
disturbing -- observation: In 1976, seven of those banks
hailed from California; but now, "three of those are owned by
the Japanese and one has withdrawn from international
business."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Douglas Kidd, a senior vice president at Bankers Trust Co.
in New York, said that "a major part of our growth over the
past five years has been overseas" because of constraints on
what the bank can do in the U.S. "You have our taxes moving
offshore and our employees moving offshore," he said.
   Nobody in the room needed to be reminded that U.S. banks
aren't as competitive as they used to be. In the past few
years, many have retreated from international business, or
sold operations to meet new international capital
requirements, and watched foreign banks gobble up an
ever-increasing chunk of the U.S. market.
   This trend threatens to damage the competitiveness of U.S.
industry -- especially the export sector -- and erodes
revenue in industries that serve banks, such as computer
companies, according to analysts and bankers. It also means
fewer jobs.
   Moreover, the growing foreign presence in the U.S. raises
concerns about the concentration of economic and financial
power, especially in terms of doling out credit to U.S.
industries and companies that compete with foreign ones.
   U.S. offices of foreign banks now control roughly a
quarter of U.S. banking assets -- Japanese owners alone
account for 14% -- compared with 14% foreign control in 1982
and 3.8% in 1973. The consolidated U.S. assets of six
Japanese banks would rank them among the 30 largest U.S. bank
holding companies, and "a couple would be within striking
distance of the 10th largest banking organization in the
U.S.," according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York.
   At the same time, U.S. banks are shedding businesses
either to help stay afloat or to meet international capital
standards planned for 1992. In the past few years, Chase
Manhattan Bank sold a Dutch bank with $5 billion of assets to
France's Credit Lyonnais, and BankAmerica Corp. sold its
Italian bank to Germany's Deutsche Bank AG. Just last week,
Bank of Tokyo Ltd. closed its $500 million purchase of Bank
of New England Corp.'s leasing unit.
   Noting that U.S. banks are unloading operations in Asia as
well as in Europe, Alexis Wolkenstein, head of the
international division of Credit Lyonnais said, "I don't
understand the American banks; they are giving up markets and
relationships that took years to build." He added: "This is a
loss to the U.S.; it gives it less influence in the world."
   At home, U.S. banks suffer from excess capacity -- there
are simply too many banks -- as well as from geographic
limits on where they can take deposits and restrictions on
what products they can sell. U.S. banks also have shot
themselves in the foot, lending billions of dollars to
developing countries that may never be able to repay them and
lending too much to the real estate and oil industries in the
U.S.
   John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, said the company wanted
the right to take deposits anywhere in the U.S., in addition
to securities powers and possibly the right to underwrite and
sell insurance. "Clearly, the geography thing killed us, and
the degree to which industrial companies are in our
business," Mr. Reed said. "It takes a lot of banking business
away from us."
   Charles S. Sanford Jr., chairman of Bankers Trust, said,
"Not having securities powers makes U.S. banks less
competitive with European banks, and this will be exacerbated
when Japanese banks get more powers."
   Meanwhile, 15 years of unsteady economic growth and
volatility in the inflation rate in the U.S., plus the
nation's deteriorating trade position and its low savings
rate "have all contributed to a financial environment that
breeds difficulties at home and contributes to slippage
abroad," E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed,
said in recent congressional testimony.
   In the Far East, U.S. banks face rich, aggressive Japanese
banks; in Europe, powerful banking institutions are allowed
to enter businesses in their home markets -- such as
investment banking and insurance -- that are denied to U.S.
banks in their own markets. Europe's big banks also stand to
gain from the planned 1992 abolition of trade and financial
barriers among the 12 countries of the European Community.
   The turmoil in the Japanese stock and bond markets this
year resulted in lower earnings for Japanese banks and chewed
up some capital represented by stock they hold in Japanese
companies. But Kaneo Nakamura, president of Industrial Bank
of Japan Ltd., and Teruyoshi Yasufuku, deputy president of
Sanwa Bank Ltd., both said that talk of a pullback by Japan's
big banks was exaggerated. "The markets {in Japan} have
improved, and the {Japanese} economy is strong," Mr. Yasufuku
said.
   "It will still be several years until Japanese banks'
advantages in cost of equity and borrowed funds dissipates,"
said Perry Quick, a principal at Quick, Finan &amp; Associates,
an economic consulting firm in Washington.
   And while U.S. banks still are regarded as leaders in
financial innovation and sophistication, "our lead in
technology is narrowing," he said. "Japan is developing its
own financial technology or buying it."
   U.S. banks are also considered to be more profitable than
many of their foreign competitors. Nonetheless, Mr. Reed of
Citicorp said that neither the West German nor the Japanese
stock markets penalize their banks for their low
profitability. By contrast, the shares of many U.S. banks
have been severely depressed.
   The West German banking system, said Hans-Georg Engel,
resident counsel at J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.'s Frankfurt branch, is
one of the world's strongest. Because its big universal banks
can bank anywhere in the country, and can trade stocks and
bonds and sell insurance, "they are less exposed to cyclical
shocks," he said. "The universal banks are well-capitalized,
have good asset quality, weren't hurt by the stock market
crash in 1987 and have absorbed their LDC {less developed
country, or Third World lending} problems."
   In his testimony, Mr. Corrigan of the New York Fed said
that the U.S. is "the only major country that does not have a
true national banking system." Even after the planned
dismantling of some barriers to interstate banking, he said,
the U.S. will still be left with a "crazy-quilt pattern" of
state and federal laws and regulations.
   Structurally, the U.S. banking system is increasingly
viewed as obsolete, especially when rapid technological
change is creating instruments that blur traditional product
lines. Moreover, many corporations whose credit ratings are
higher than those of banks now can raise money through bond
and stock markets, bypassing U.S. banks altogether.
   "Financial services have become commodities available from
a number of differing bank and non-bank sources, and
distinctions between products have faded," said Cynthia
Glassman, director of research for Furash &amp; Co., a consulting
firm in Washington.
   Noting that a European corporation can have all its
financial needs met by a single institution, she said: "A
U.S. company has to go different places for a loan,
underwriting and insurance. The difference is like buying a
car and buying the parts separately to build the car."
   Mr. Engel of Morgan said: "If a Volkswagen, a Lufthansa or
a BASF asks you to do for it in America what you do for it in
Europe, you're forced to say you can't, even though it's your
home market, your currency and the world's major currency.
That has a tremendous impact on the competitiveness of U.S.
banks."
   As Mr. Corrigan himself testified last month: "The U.S.
banking system is simply out of step with the rest of the
world, and more importantly, it is out of step with the
realities of the marketplace."

   AIDS Vaccine Is Promising in Test Tube

   Volunteers' Lymphocytes
   Show Surprising Ability
   To Root Out the Virus

   Blood cells taken from volunteers immunized with an
experimental AIDS vaccine showed an unexpected ability in the
test tube to selectively destroy cells infected with the AIDS
virus.
   The finding suggests that a type of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome vaccine may be more effective than
scientists had previously thought. The scientists cautioned,
however, that it still may take several years to develop and
test a safe and effective AIDS vaccine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The vaccine involved in a human experiment at Johns
Hopkins University medical school was genetically engineered
by Micro-GeneSys Inc. of West Haven, Conn. Similar
experimental vaccines have been developed by Bristol-Myers
Squibb Inc. and by Genentech Inc., which announced last week
that its vaccine had protected two chimpanzees against
deliberate infections with the AIDS virus and that tests in
humans might begin this summer.
   The experimental vaccines are known as subunit vaccines,
because they are made only of certain proteins that coat the
human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-1, which causes AIDS. Most
conventional vaccines are made of a whole virus. The hope is
that the viral surface protein alone will trick the body's
immune system into launching an attack against HIV-1.
   The three companies each have their own version of a
subunit vaccine made with an HIV-1 protein known as gp160.
The vaccine is designed to trigger an immune attack on
anything that displays gp160.
   Most vaccines, including AIDS vaccines, are aimed at
triggering the body to make antibodies that will disable the
infecting virus. But in AIDS, the virus wreaks its havoc by
worming its way into certain white blood cells, where it
escapes the attack by antibodies. The virus's destruction of
these infected blood cells is what cripples the immune system
and causes AIDS.
   There has been some question about whether the subunit
vaccines, such as those made with gp160 protein, can trick
the body into activating "killer" lymphocytes that will
destroy cells that are infected with the deadly virus. If so,
the vaccines would be more effective than if they just
activated antibodies against the freefloating virus.
   The new experiment at Johns Hopkins, reported in this
week's issue of Science, indicated that the gp160 vaccine
will, indeed, activate killer cells that attack HIV-infected
blood cells. But the vaccines did so in an unexpected way.
   In their experiment, the researchers vaccinated eight
healthy human volunteers with four extremely small doses of
the MicroGeneSys gp160 protein. They then extracted the
lymphocytes from the blood of the volunteers. Laboratory
tests found that lymphocytes from three of the volunteers
did, in fact, kill HIV-infected cells.
   "This was the first time this vaccine was used in humans,
so we used extremely low doses on the order of 40 thousandths
of a gram," noted co-author Robert F. Siliciano in explaining
why only three of the eight patients appeared to respond to
the vaccine. Tests are under way to see whether higher doses
will produce immune responses in a greater proportion of
volunteers.
   As they proceeded in their laboratory experiments, the
researchers found that the killer lymphocytes were of a type
known as CD4-positive lymphocytes. These CD4-positive
lymphocytes ordinarily don't operate as killer cells. Yet the
vaccine had done something to turn them into killers.
   Moreover, the CD4-positive lymphocytes picked out and
destroyed only those cells that were infected and ignored
cells that had accidentally picked up scraps of the HIV-1
virus on their surfaces.
   The tests also indicated that the CD4-positive killers
activated by the vaccine will destroy cells infected by
almost any version of the lethal HIV-1 virus. Scientists have
worried that a vaccine may be effective against only one or a
few of the several varieties of the HIV-1.

   Societe Generale
   De Belgique Gives
   Loan to Its Unit

   BRUSSELS -- Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. provided an
emergency loan to its Fabrique Nationale Herstal unit but
threatened to pull the plug on the maker of Browning rifles
unless a new rescue plan is in place within four months.
   Meanwhile, Generale confirmed that its public offering of
shares in another unit, the mining and metals-refining
company Acec-Union Miniere, had flopped.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fabrique Nationale has been one of the main blots on a
largely successful effort by Generale to reinvigorate its
Belgian industrial and financial interests in the two years
since Cie. Financiere de Suez of France acquired 51% of
Generale in a takeover contest.
   Fabrique Nationale, which makes a variety of small arms
and has interests in the making of airplane engines, had a
loss of 2.1 billion Belgian francs ($60 million) for 1989 on
sales of 21.14 billion francs. The loss reflected a
world-wide drop in military spending, huge restructuring
costs, and problems at its aerospace-engine unit, a majority
of which was sold last year to France's Societe Nationale
d'Etudes &amp; de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation.
   For the first five months of 1990, the unit's losses
totaled about 800 million francs, a Generale spokesman said.
   Generale said it would extend 1.5 billion francs of
subordinated loans to allow the unit to continue operating
through September. But Generale warned that it wouldn't be
able to renew its financial support to Fabrique Nationale if
the company fails to obtain an agreement from unions and
other interested parties on a new restructuring plan by the
end of September.
   At the same time, the unit announced the resignation of
its director general, Jacques Germay, saying he "didn't wish
to be associated in the new phase of (Fabrique Nationale's)
life." Mr. Germay couldn't be reached for comment, but an
executive close to the company said his departure apparently
reflected disagreements over strategy.
   Only three months ago, Fabrique Nationale said Mr. Germay
would be part of a three-man executive office heading the
company. The other two members were Joseph Labye, an
industrial consultant who joined Fabrique Nationale this
year, and Albert Diehl, a veteran Fabrique Nationale
executive. Fabrique Nationale said its board named Mr. Diehl
chairman and Mr. Labye chief executive officer.
   In another embarrassment for Generale, its banking
affiliate, Generale de Banque, said investors applied for
45.3% of the two million shares offered in Acec.
   The offering, which ended last week after a three-day
extension, was designed to reduce the holding company's stake
in Acec to about 79.5% from 87.5%. But Generale and its bank
affiliate said they will buy unsold shares, rather than
requiring underwriters of the offering to buy them.
   The offering was priced in mid-May at 4,250 francs a
share.
   Generale's proceeds from the share sale will total around
3.8 billion francs.

   Profit-taking pushed the over-the-counter market lower,
but traders said sellers displayed little conviction while
buyers were ready to absorb shares as prices fell.
   "Stocks are coming down, but not hard," said Jerry
Markowitz, partner in charge of OTC trading at Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco. "I think it will run its course
within a day or two."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.87, or 0.19%, to 464.09.
By contrast, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell
0.47%.
   Some telecommunications stocks fared better. The Nasdaq
Utility Index, which is heavily weighted with the group, rose
0.52 to 669.33. Tele-Communications Class A, one of the
biggest stocks in the group by value of its outstanding
shares, rose 3/8 to 15 3/4.
   Overall, advancing OTC issues trailed decliners, 957 to
989. Volume eased to 151 million shares from 156.5 million
Wednesday.
   "They're getting a little tired," remarked Robert O'Toole
Sr., head of OTC trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, of
bullish investors. "But, I don't think they're dead. There
are bids all the way down with these stocks."
   Program selling in exchange-listed issues drove the OTC
market lower too, explained Richard Bruno, head of OTC
trading for PaineWebber. "There's definitely a connection
between program trading and the OTC market," he said. Among
large investors, Mr. Bruno said he saw more institutions
willing to sell shares than he has in several weeks. He
added, however, that he doesn't think the market is changing
course, but is "just taking a breather."
   Two relatively new issues suffered in yesterday's market.
Shares of Urcarco, a Dallas retailer of used cars and trucks,
fell 1 3/4 to 17 in heavy trading. The company went public
May 31 with an initial offering of five million common shares
priced at $19.875 each.
   Urcarco said it is in discussions with its lead bank, NCNB
Texas National Bank, a unit of NCNB Corp., to "significantly
increase" its revolving credit line, and with investment
bankers to consider securitizing its automobile note
portfolio and sell commercial paper.
   Pharmacy Management Services, which tumbled yesterday amid
analysts' concerns about earnings, extended its slide. Shares
of the drug development company fell 2 1/2 to 13 5/8.
Pharmacy Management went public April 4 at $12 a share and
rose as high as 18 1/2 last month.
   MCI Communications was unchanged at 42. Wednesday, a
federal appeals court panel overturned a Federal
Communications Commission decision allowing the competing
Bell companies to combine their regulated and unregulated
subsidiaries. MCI, which had appealed the regulators'
decision, was "delighted" with the court decision, a
spokesman said. Also yesterday, the Washington, D.C.,
long-distance carrier said it will begin a joint marketing
program with Hotelcopy Inc. allowing MCI to compete in the
hotel industry with its FaxMail network.
   Adobe Systems, one of yesterday's few strong technology
issues, rose 2 to 35 3/4 after the Mountain View, Calif.,
software maker announced another licensing pact with a blue
chip company. Adobe reached an agreement with Eastman Kodak
Co. giving Kodak licensing rights to the company's PostScript
software technology. Wednesday, Adobe announced a similar
agreement with Xerox.
   InterVoice added 1 to 19 1/4. Although the Dallas maker of
telephone voice-response systems said late Wednesday that its
first-quarter earnings outlook is weak, the company's board
also approved the repurchase of up to one million shares of
its 5.6 million outstanding common stock. InterVoice said
that revenue of $4.88 million in the first fiscal quarter
ended May 31 are below expectations and will pressure
quarterly income, due for release later this month. The
company reported net income of $1.1 million, or 27 cents a
share, on revenue of nearly $5 million in the year-earlier
quarter.
   Intel slid 7/8 to 46 7/8. The Santa Clara, Calif.,
electronic equipment maker said it plans to build a
$300-million manufacturing plant in Dublin with the support
of the Industrial Development Authority of Ireland. Among
other weak technology issues, Apple Computer slipped 1/2 to
39; Microsoft fell 1 to 72, and Oracle Systems dropped 1/2 to
20 5/8. Sun Microsystems rose 3/8 to 31 3/8.
   Weak earnings outlooks hurt several stocks. Orthomet
plunged 2 3/8 to 9 after the Minneapolis maker of orthopedic
products said late yesterday that earnings for the fourth
quarter ending June 30 will be "at or near break even,"
rather than the slight profit some analysts had expected, Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report said. Craig-Hallum Inc.
analyst Dennis Nielsen told DJPIR he'd been estimating that
Orthomet would earn eight cents a share for the fourth
quarter, compared with a loss of 18 cents a share a year
earlier. Orthomet said fourth-quarter sales will exceed sales
for the year-earlier period, but won't match third quarter
sales.
   Newport News Savings Bank slid 1 to 3 after the Newport
News, Va., bank said United Financial Banking Cos. ended
merger talks between the two institutions.
   EA Engineering, Science, &amp; Technology fell 1 to 8 3/4
after the Hunt Valley, Md., environmental-consulting concern
cautioned investors that its net income for the third quarter
ended May 31 will be lower than the year-earlier net income
of 12 cents a share.
   Norstan tumbled 1 1/2 to 13 1/4 after the Minneapolis
digital communications concern said that it's reviewing the
value of its $5.65 million stake in New Summit Inc., which is
in default on certain of its loan covenants with a lender.
Norstan said that any potential reduction in the value of the
investment could will be recorded as a loss in the fourth
quarter ended April 30. However, the company said it expects
that operating income for the fourth quarter and year to be
in line with analysts' projections.

   URCARCO Inc. sold five million shares at $19.875 each on
May 31, but went public last November at $11 a share.
Friday's OTC Focus column incorrectly identified the May
stock sale as an initial public offering.

   New Civil-Rights Bill
   Won't Mandate Quotas

<LP>
   In "The 1990 Civil Rights Bill Is Wrong" (editorial page,
May 4) Abigail Thernstrom misrepresents the intent and the
effect of the Civil Rights Act of 1990. This bill corrects a
series of Supreme Court decisions made in June 1989 that
narrowly interpret equal-employment opportunity and
civil-rights laws. It does not mandate or "invite" quotas, as
Ms. Thernstrom asserts.
   For 18 years, employers had the burden of showing that
employment practices with a "disparate impact" (that operated
to exclude minorities and women disproportionately) are
required by business necessity. The Supreme Court's June 1989
decision in Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio razed this
settled law and placed an extreme and unprecedented burden on
discrimination victims by making them prove specifically the
practice that ultimately led to discrimination. The Civil
Rights Act of 1990 sends the message that employment
discrimination is never acceptable and returns the burden of
justifying any business practice that results in disparate
impact to the employer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Furthermore, on May 2 the bill was amended so that
employers can prove business necessity by showing that a
challenged practice "bears a substantial and demonstrable
relationship to effective job performance." In other words,
employment decisions made to create an effective work force
are justifiable under the Civil Rights Act of 1990. Thus, the
law allows employers to hire the best-qualified people and
does not place us on the crest of the slippery slope of
hiring and promotion quotas as envisioned by Ms. Thernstrom.
   Ms. Thernstrom says the Civil Rights Act of 1990 may
"deliver a message that minority groups amount to separate
nations and separate nations require distinct treatment." To
the contrary, the act seeks to prevent dangerous separate
treatment, which is in part what triggered Wards Cove. In
this case, Frank Atonio and other salmon-cannery workers,
mostly Filipinos and Alaska Natives, sued their employer for
hiring practices that excluded them from the better-paying
jobs and favored whites. For instance, the Wards Cove Packing
Co. maintained racially separate hiring pools and job
categories. The company's dormitories and cafeterias
generally separated white employees from nonwhite employees.
"Separate" and "distinct" treatment is precisely what the act
seeks to eliminate by providing discrimination victims a
reasonable chance of proving discrimination.
   The Civil Rights Act of 1990 also addresses other
intolerable inconsistencies created by the Supreme Court's
June 1989 decisions. The law ensures that job bias based on
gender and race is always illegal, that statutes of
limitation are applied fairly and consistently, and that
victims of intentional discrimination can recover damages.
   If passed, the Civil Rights Act of 1990 will enable this
country to continue to eradicate workplace discrimination by
restoring the well-tested legal standards used to prove
employment discrimination for the past 25 years.

   SHENZHEN, China -- Businessmen, step right up] The
People's Republic of China has just the deal for you.
   In a special one-time offer, the Chinese government is
selling state-owned Xinle Wood Furniture Factory to the
highest bidder, Chinese or foreign. Xinle Wood is a furniture
maker that lost a bundle in 1988 and then a bunch more in
1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   There's more. Whoever buys the factory also inherits its
33 employees. For life. That's because when you tap into the
socialist system, you must play by its rules. And
state-employed workers don't get fired, even if there's no
work to do. On a recent afternoon, three of the 33 paid
employees were on the job: two women idly chatting in a
corner and a young man hammering nails into some plywood.
   Still interested? The successful bidder also can continue
Xinle Wood's product line. In fact, according to the rules,
the winning bidder MUST stick to the stuff that got Xinle
Wood where it is today: cheap desks and wardrobes, and bed
frames with headboards sporting two big pink hearts on a
baby-blue background.
   The offer ends soon, so send in those bids. The government
of Shenzhen, a Chinese "special economic zone" bordering Hong
Kong, is hoping to pull in roughly $3 million for the
factory.
   In addition to Xinle Wood, the government is selling three
other struggling state-owned enterprises. There's Xinle Metal
Products Co., also in the red, and two factories barely
breaking even: Xinle Bedding Supplies and Xinle Sofa Co.
   A word of caution: If a bidder's goal is to help hasten
the privatization of China's state-run economy, it's best to
keep that under one's hat. The P-word has become taboo in
China since the lethal suppression of last year's student-led
protest movement in Beijing.
   Nonetheless, the Shenzhen government is touting the
planned sales as a bold new step in China's economic-reform
program. Guo Weiping, the bureaucrat overseeing the sale
offer, calls it "industrial adjustment." Put another way, the
four factories' state-run parent, Shenzhen Decoration &amp;
Construction Industrial Co., gets to dump a handful of money
losers.
   To date, no U.S. company has made a bid since the sale
offer was announced April 23. But Shenzhen is hopeful. "We
definitely welcome U.S. investment," says Mr. Guo, adding as
a tease, "The first companies to jump on such an offer are
sure to succeed."

   I was most distressed by Charles M. Hart's May 2 letter to
the editor in which he implies that "the young basketball
player who died on the court recently . . ." (meaning Hank
Gathers of Loyola Marymount University) was somehow illicitly
provided $6,600 with which to pay the premium on a
disability-insurance policy.
   The facts are that the decedent arranged financing with a
local bank in a transaction that, I am informed, is not
unique among college basketball players of Mr. Gathers's
quality. If he does not suffer a career-threatening injury
the loan is to be paid off out of the anticipated signing
bonus; but, if he is not signed because of injury, the loan
is paid out of the proceeds of the policy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The late and much lamented Hank Gathers, fondly remembered
as "Hank the Bank," was an extraordinary athlete. He was also
an extraordinary human being. He was a senior at LMU and,
like every other senior teammate of his, would have graduated
this academic year. The degree he worked so hard to achieve
(and would receive if alive) will be granted to him
posthumously.
   Hank Gathers was a class human being and he had the good
fortune to have attended a class institution. Neither of them
deserves Mr. Hart's innuendo.

   NEW YORK -- The world's industrial economies are growing
at a steady but slowing pace, latest figures indicate.
   The Conference Board, a business information service, said
its International Economic Scoreboard shows that the
composite leading index for 11 major industrial countries is
growing at a 1% annual rate, down slightly from the 2% growth
rate three months ago and 3% rate six months ago. The figure
suggests slower growth ahead, the report said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The report looks at leading indicators, or measures
thought to signal economic turns because they generally rise
or fall in advance of the general economy. The report for the
most part covers statistics as current as February and March.
   The Pacific region continues to show the greatest
strength, especially in Taiwan, where the leading index is
growing at an 8% annual rate; Korea's rate is 5%. Growth has
slowed in New Zealand, 1%, and Japan, 0%.
   "The weakest economy among these 11 countries is still
Australia, where the long drop in the leading index --
declining at a 6% rate -- looks more and more like a
recession," the report said.
   In Europe, growth rates are "essentially flat," except for
West Germany's 5% annual growth rate. Others include Italy,
2%, France, -1% and the United Kingdom, -3%.
   In Canada, the leading index is growing at a 1% rate while
in the U.S. the leading index is flat.
   The indexes are compiled monthly by the Center for
International Business Cycle Research at the Columbia
University Business School.

   Oil Tankers Need Double Hulls

<LP>
   As the author of language in the House oil-spill bill to
require double hulls on all tankers operating in U.S. waters
within 15 years, I take great exception to your May 7
editorial "Double Whammy."
   Your use of phrases such as "dubious" technology, "popular
quick fix" and "an expensive way for Congress to show it is
doing something" is misleading and incorrect.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   You ignore the large and ever-growing body of evidence
that a double hull is the most effective available technology
to prevent many spills and reduce the damage from others. The
Coast Guard says that of five recent major spills, four,
including the California spill caused by the vessel's own
anchor, would have been prevented if the vessels had been
constructed with double hulls; it also said the spill from
the Exxon Valdez accident would have been reduced 60% with a
double hull.
   Calculated over the lifetime of a tanker, the added cost
of double-hull construction is one-tenth of one cent per
gallon.
   If, in fact, the value of double hulls is still in doubt,
why do we currently require them on ships carrying liquified
natural gas and other hazardous materials?
   The House supported my double-hull requirement 376-37; a
similar requirement in the Senate fell two votes short.
   We have a window of opportunity now that we will not have
again for more than two decades. By 1992, more than 40% of
the current world fleet will be more than 20 years old, and
another 25% will be in the 15-to-19-year-old range. In the
Alaskan fleet, the average age is 18 years.
   We will lose a valuable opportunity to increase safety at
a reasonable cost if we wait for additional studies that are
likely to confirm what we already know -- that double hulls
prevent accidents.
   Rep. Dean A. Gallo (R., N.J.)
   Washington
   ---
   You stated that tanker double bottoms may not prevent
every oil spill, yet for many years hazardous cargoes have
been required to be carried in double-bottom or double-hull
ships. In fact, with few exceptions, all ships carrying
products other than petroleum have double bottoms. Also,
there is little evidence to suggest that ship-stability
problems are aggravated by double hulls or double bottoms.
   The Exxon Valdez disaster was an extraordinary occurrence
and, as you point out, oil would still have been spilled even
if the ship had been fitted with a double bottom/double hull.
However, if the ship had been designed and built with a
double hull or bottom, the oil spilled would have been
reduced in quantity and flow, thereby aiding in the cleanup.
The reality is that normal collisions and groundings of
single-hull tankers will almost always result in the release
of oil, and the reverse is true for double-hull tankers.
   Most of us in the marine industry are just as concerned
with maintaining the quality of the oceans as the
environmentalists your editorial discredits. Within our
industry, there is little argument about the superiority of
double-hull construction as a deterrent to oil pollution.
   The combination of increasing prices, tightening of some
world-wide capacity, and an international agreement
eradicating subsidy practices leaves U.S. shipyards in an
enviable position since American yards have available
capacity, a stable labor situation, and long-term competitive
pricing to pursue commercial market opportunities. This has
led U.S. yards and naval architects to design double-hull
tankers that will cost less to build and be cheaper and safer
to operate.

   African Immigrants in Paris Learn
   Squatters' Rights Don't Include Homes

   PARIS -- At first glance, the small square in Paris's 20th
Arrondissement is an exotic relief from a gray urban
backdrop.
   Women glide about in bright batik robes and headwraps of
Mali and Senegal, preparing the evening meal. As more women
emerge from the relative cool of their tents to join in the
work, their talk grows louder until it wakes sleeping babies
strapped to their backs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The men sit in a circle in the shade of a scrawny ash
tree, cracking nuts and talking quietly in dialects of their
native villages. The smell of peanut stew and rice hangs in
the air, drawing a stream of children from the tents.
   This odd village may seem pleasant enough to passersby.
But to the 48 families living here since May 2, when they
were evicted from two vacant apartment buildings nearby, it's
a caricature of home.
   The dozens of mattresses covering the ground inside the
tents are filthy after 28 days' double duty as floor and
bedding. Out of nearly 300 people camping in the square, 153
are children. The square has no toilet; a small fountain
provides the only water.
   Paris municipal authorities say these people don't have a
right to public housing because they illegally "squatted" in
vacant buildings. Granting their housing demands, Paris
Deputy Mayor Jean Tiberi has said, would create a dangerous
precedent, and would "penalize those who respect the law and
had patience to wait."
   Jean Blocquaux of France's Social Affairs Ministry rejects
this argument. The expelled squatters have done more than
their share of waiting; some have been on the city's
"priority" housing list for 13 years, he notes. For many,
their homes were destroyed by arson or were condemned, and
the city was legally obligated to rehouse them.
   "It didn't," says Mr. Blocquaux, "and so they found
themselves in the street."
   The Africans said they saw public housing buildings
standing vacant for months at a time. Finally, out of angry
desperation, they moved in.
   The irony -- at a time when race and immigration are
explosive issues in France -- is that as a group, these
squatters are successful examples of immigrant integration.
Most hold full-time jobs. All pay taxes and send their
children to French schools.
   Mamadou, 37 years old, who asked to be identified only by
his first name, emigrated from Mali to France 15 years ago.
He has been on the city's waiting list for rent-controlled
housing since 1980. He works full time, as a maintenance man
in a Paris fitness club. Out of his monthly paycheck of 5,600
francs (about $985), he returns almost 2,000 francs to the
state. More than 10% of his taxes are a fee for "housing
aid," which the government redistributes to low-income
families."It's a bad joke," Mamadou says.
   The joke gets worse: Some of the men in the encampment are
employed by the city as street sweepers. "I was hired to
clean the street -- not to live in it," a Senegalese man
says.
   Mr. Blocquaux and others in the Socialist-led government
say the city's allocation of public housing is unfair. They
say Paris possesses many vacant public-housing units, which
it holds for preferred clients. Mr. Blocquaux thinks the city
is discriminating on racial grounds, noting that of 3,000 new
public housing units provided in 1988, only 132 were given to
immigrant families. Yet there were 14,000 immigrant families
on the "priority" list.
   A recent government report shows that more than 60% of
units the city provided since 1988 were priced beyond the
means of people eligible for them. Only the richest of the
poor can afford "low-rent" housing.
   The government blames Gaullist Mayor Jacques Chirac for
what it believes to be a policy of gentrification; it says
Mr. Chirac fills public housing with allies who are not
underprivileged.
   At Place de la Reunion, neighbors have rallied with an
overwhelming show of solidarity for the immigrants.
Restaurants donated food and kitchen equipment; residents
opened their homes and pocketbooks, and children from a
nearby school wrote a letter to City Hall. A local support
committee provides day care for the children and drives them
to school.
   But this informal group is made up of volunteers who have
jobs. Some days the van doesn't come, so the kids miss
school, a few miles away. Last week, when no van came,
Mamadou's nine-year-old son took a subway trip with his
three-year-old sister to find school on their own. Mamadou
and his wife, Hawa, were frantic. "We were very lucky they
came back safe," she says.
   Sooner or later, that family will have a home. The city
has backed down from its initial refusal, and has now
proposed apartments -- to 12 families -- in the northern
suburb of Saint-Denis.
   Most of the apartments are in a building that was
condemned several years ago. Paris, which owns it, has now
"un-condemned" it, although some apartments -- which lack
bathrooms, heat and hot water -- are not yet habitable.
   Paris has lost 10% of its population since 1982, as
skyrocketing real-estate prices drive people farther away.
There are dwindling pockets of the mix of races and classes,
businesses and residences that historically characterized the
city.
   Looking around the squatters' square on the Place de la
Reunion, Mamadou says, "Sometimes it does seem like a
village. But in a village, you can do as you like; here you
struggle to keep up morale."

   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government decided to delay for
three years a planned smoking ban on international flights of
more than six hours by Canadian carriers.
   The Transport Department said the ban, which was to have
taken effect July 1, will now be implemented July 1, 1993.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the meantime, the department said carriers will be
required to reduce the proportion of seats for smokers on
long-range flights by 25% July 1 and by similar amounts
annually until July 1, 1993, when the ban takes effect.
   The department, in explaining its decision to delay the
ban, said Canadian airlines and some labor groups have
expressed concern that the Canadian airline industry would
suffer "serious declines in passenger traffic in markets
which have higher percentages of smokers, such as Eastern
Europe and the Far East."
   A smoking ban currently applies to all domestic Canadian
flights, to Canada-U.S. flights and to international flights
of less than six hours.

   Junk Sale Plan
   Gets a Boost

   Aided by Finance Terms;
   Proposal May Help U.S.

<LP>
   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association's proposed junk-bond
sale are boosting the chances that the controversial
transaction will be completed and possibly offer a model for
helping the government out of its growing junk-bond woes,
according to sources familiar with the plan.
   As previously reported, Columbia is offering to finance
between 85% and 90% of the purchase price for its portfolio,
which has a current market value of about $2.9 billion. But
the key element of the plan, being outlined to potential
bidders in documents being sent as early as today, is an
offer, apparently cleared at least tentatively by regulators,
to finance the sale on a nonrecourse basis, according to
people close to the company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Such nonrecourse financing would greatly limit any buyer's
risk of loss from the deal. In essence, if the buyer were to
default on a note for the balance of the purchase price, the
buyer would only risk losing the cash downpayment, and
Columbia would again be stuck with the bonds. The note,
backed by the bonds, would also carry a double-digit interest
rate to cover Columbia's high-cost deposit base, the sources
said.
   Another attraction of the deal, the sources said, is that
any buyer would have some latitude in selling the bonds and
replacing them with other collateral for the note, offering a
chance to take advantage of price changes for individual
issues.
   The terms appear to have ignited some interest in the
transaction, code-named the Big Lift, which many analysts had
seriously doubted would ever get off the ground.
   "I think what regulators and Columbia have come up with is
ingenious," said one of the bidders, who requested anonymity.
   Added another person close to Columbia who is familiar
with the bidding process, "I think people are putting real
bids on the table. Nobody has taken the process fallaciously
in any way, and I know one bidder, an institution that is
extremely well-run and does not do wheel spins, and they have
spent unbelievable amounts of man hours on this."
   This person added, however, "It is hard to put a
probability on it. Whenever the government has the final say,
they can act very far outside the rationale of what normal
finance people do. It is a very political thing too."
   At least a half dozen bidders are still interested in the
portfolio, Columbia officials said, although they declined to
name them.
   By itself, a sale at even book value wouldn't save
Columbia, which is deeply insolvent because of more than $1
billion in losses and write-downs on its junk bonds in recent
months. Indeed, some analysts consider it probable that even
if the sale is completed, Columbia will still be taken over
by regulators.
   The takeover is likely to occur in order to facilitate the
sale of the thrift's $2 billion-deposit, 22-branch retail
system. Columbia has roughly $5 billion in additional
brokered deposits paying above-market rates, and that is
considered an impediment to any purchaser of the branch
system. A federal takeover would allow the purchaser to reset
interest rates on those deposits at more competitive rates.
   Nonetheless, the structure proposed for the sale would
help minimize losses for Columbia and could also be of some
use in helping the federal Resolution Trust Corp. unload its
estimated $4 billion junk-bond portfolio acquired through
seizure of various thrifts. To date, analysts believe the RTC
has sold only about $100 million of bonds, and critics
contend the agency hasn't devised a strategy for disposing of
the rest.
   "If we are successful, it clearly points out an
alternative for the regulators for liquidation of their
portfolios," said Columbia's president and chief executive
officer, Edward G. Harshfield, in an interview. "It also
clearly points out an alternative way to handle the bonds
before the regulators actually move from conservatorship to a
receivership situation."
   Mr. Harshfield reiterated his optimism about prospects for
a sale of Columbia's portfolio. "I was hopeful before, and I
am more hopeful now," he said. "The process has reconfirmed
that there is a real transaction here to be done. The only
question that remains is at what price." He said the company
is looking to accept bids later this month.
   In Washington, a spokesman for the RTC said the agency is
"looking at a lot of different ways of selling our assets."
   Some analysts criticized the proposed structure because
the nonrecourse financing would still leave Columbia -- or
the government in the event of a takeover -- vulnerable if
the bonds sank greatly in value.
   Others said political pressures could still confound the
sale. Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., has been a
main target of thrift-industry reformers, who have been
critical of its junk-bond investing and former chief
executive Thomas A. Spiegel's close ties to former Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond guru Michael Milken. Mr.
Harshfield, a former Citicorp and Household International
Inc. executive who was brought in with the approval of
regulators in March, has been increasingly openly critical of
prior management, a move that some perceive as a way of
defusing the political storm about Columbia's future.
   When asked whether the government is supporting his
efforts, Mr. Harshfield said, "I think that speaks for
itself. As a practical matter, we are in a negative $215
million capital position, and we are not in a
conservatorship. You have to ask what do we have going for us
here. We have only two things: the potential of doing a bond
transaction and a management here now that is running the
place as well as its predecessor and probably better."

   South Africa Ends State of Emergency
   ---
   Government Hopes Nations
   Will React by Lifting
   Economic Restrictions

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- The South African government
lifted its four-year-old state of emergency in most of the
country, hoping that the international community will now
also begin to lift its web of economic sanctions.
   The announcement by President F.W. de Klerk -- the latest
in a series of moves to normalize the country's political
situation -- repeals an array of regulations that gave the
government and police extraordinary powers to curb political
dissent through bannings, detention without trial and press
censorship. However, Mr. de Klerk said the emergency will
remain in effect in Natal province, where violence between
opposing black groups is common. More than 3,000 blacks have
died in Natal's political violence over the past three years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Most opposition organizations welcomed the end of the
emergency while also pointing out that more remained to be
done to level the political playing field for opposition
groups and eliminate apartheid, or racial segregation. Still,
it does move the government a step closer to meeting the
preconditions of the African National Congress for joining
Pretoria in full-scale negotiations over a new constitution.
In addition to the lifting of the emergency, the ANC demands
the release of all political prisoners and the return of all
exiles to South Africa. After initial talks last month
between the ANC and the government, the two sides are close
to finalizing details for fulfilling these two demands.
   The government's decision to lift the emergency comes
shortly after Mr. de Klerk's return from Europe, where, he
says, he sensed a willingness by some governments to review
their sanctions once the emergency was ended. Many of the
measures restricting trade and commerce with South Africa
were imposed as a response to Pretoria's declaration of the
emergency in June 1986. That move also triggered a wave of
disinvestment by European and U.S. corporations.
   By lifting the emergency, Pretoria is also hoping to
undercut Nelson Mandela's current tour through Europe and
North America. The African National Congress leader, who
spent 27 years in prison before being released in February,
is campaigning for sanctions to be maintained until
negotiations between the government and the black majority
over a new constitution are well under way.
   In Paris, Mr. Mandela said the lifting of the emergency
was a "victory for the people of South Africa, both black and
white." But, he added, "it doesn't change my mind" about
sanctions.
   Mr. Mandela, who is scheduled to arrive in the U.S. June
20, argues that any lessening of the sanctions pressure now
will lead Pretoria to slow down its pace of reforms. The ANC
also believes that sanctions are necessary to prod the
government's thinking on a new constitution: While the ANC
demands a one-man, one-vote system, the government rejects
simple majority rule and insists on protections for minority
rights. The ANC says this is apartheid in another guise.
   By ending the emergency, Mr. de Klerk is turning up some
pressure of his own on the ANC, particularly to renounce its
armed struggle. After last month's initial talks aimed at
clearing away the stumbling blocks for constitutional
negotiations, the government pledged to review the emergency
and the ANC promised to reassess its guerrilla campaign. Mr.
de Klerk said the government has fulfilled its part of the
agreement, and he called on the ANC to do likewise.
   "We are on the threshold of the real negotiation process
and the time has come for other important role players to do
their bit," Mr. de Klerk said. "In particular, the ANC must
now stop vacillating."
   Mr. de Klerk challenged Mr. Mandela to stop advocating
guerrilla activity and criticized his statement earlier this
week that the ANC approves of organized violence against
chosen targets. The ANC argues that its armed struggle
continues to be necessary as long as apartheid is still in
place.
   The government, which has embarked on a series of reforms
since it unbanned the ANC in February, is dependent on the
ANC's cooperation to fend off the white right wing. As the
white electorate watches the government make one concession
after another to the black majority, the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party is steadily eroding the support of the
ruling National Party. In a parliamentary by-election
Wednesday, the Conservatives fell only 500 votes short of
capturing a traditionally safe National Party seat. Last
October, the National Party won the seat by 3,000 votes.
   The Conservatives will make further gains should unrest
flare up after the lifting of the emergency. Conservative
Party leader Andries Treurnicht called the government move,
"another concession to the ANC."
   Still, the government has plenty of power under other
security legislation to restrict political activity and
control unrest by using the law and the courts. Mr. de Klerk
also announced plans to beef up the police force.
   Under the emergency, the police were protected against
prosecution for many of their actions and government
ministers could act without consulting parliament. As a
result, more than 30,000 people were detained in the past
four years, some two dozen organizations were banned,
political rallies were outlawed at will and several
newspapers were shut down for various periods of time. The
country's legal system was rendered virtually powerless, as
judges' discretion was generally limited to ruling whether a
particular action was covered by the emergency decree.

   Gene Defect That Causes Inherited Form
   Of Kidney Failure Is Found by Scientists

   Researchers said they found a gene defect responsible for
an inherited type of kidney failure, an often-fatal problem
requiring dialysis treatments or kidney transplants.
   Researchers at the University of Utah and in Finland said
the inherited defect, called Alport syndrome, is one of the
more common inherited diseases, affecting about one in 5,000
people. It may account for 2,000 of the 100,000 Americans
with kidney failure who must have their blood cleansed
several times a week by expensive dialysis treatments paid
for by a special federal Medicare program.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The scientists said they expected the discovery to produce
a genetic test that could detect whether relatives of people
with the disease also inherited the gene defect. Early
detection before kidneys begin to fail might make possible
certain drug therapy that can forestall the damage caused by
the faulty gene.
   Moreover, "knowing the exact gene may help to develop
drugs that can treat kidney failure once it occurs, something
we can't do now," said David Barker, one of the Utah
researchers whose report of the finding is published in
today's Science magazine.
   The gene's discovery is a result of scientists' new
ability to map the location of previously hidden genes, a
technology driving an intense world-wide effort to map the
human genome, the entire collection of genes. The Alport
syndrome gene is located on the X chromosome. Each human cell
contains 23 pairs of chromosomes on which all the genes
reside, one of each pair being inherited from each parent.
   The disease is most common among men because they inherit
just one X chromosome, along with a Y chromosome. Women
inherit two copies of the X chromosome. Thus, defective genes
on one copy of the chromosome are often countered by a normal
copy on the other one.
   Researchers in Utah have been searching for the gene
defect since 1949, when doctors at the university's school of
medicine identified a very large family in which the disease
was being transmitted from generation to generation. In the
1950s, Curtis Atkin, a member of the family with the disease,
joined the university's gene hunt. Under his direction, the
researchers located about 35 affected families in the area
with thousands of members.
   In 1988, Mr. Atkin and colleagues reported that by sifting
through the families' DNA, or genetic material, they found a
marker for the gene on the X chromosome. But they still
didn't have the gene itself, nor did they know how it caused
the kidneys to fail. Then, earlier this year, researchers at
the University of Oulu in Finland found most of a gene that
directs cells to make a kidney collagen, a protein that is
part of the kidney's blood-filtering machinery. The gene, it
turns out, is located at the same spot as the marker found by
the Utah investigators.
   In the report in Science, the researchers said they tested
the DNA from 18 of the families and found that people with
the disease were missing fragments of the collagen gene. The
scientists expect to find the altered gene in the rest of the
families, too. The defect apparently causes the slow
deterioration of kidney tissue.
   "It's our belief that many patients with the inherited
form of this disease aren't being properly identified right
now, and that many of their relatives who are at risk aren't
being treated to prevent the disease's onset," said Martin
Gregory, another member of the Utah team.
   The researchers said they will have the test when they
find the entire collagen gene. Right now, they only have part
of it. Doctors believe they can delay the disease's onset
with so-called ACE inhibitors, drugs used for treating
hypertension.
   The research also was conducted by Mark Skolnick, Steven
Gerken and Arnold Oliphant in Utah, and Karl Tryggvason in
Finland.

   BUENOS AIRES -- Argentina made a $40 million interest
payment to foreign creditors, the first since foreign debt
payments were suspended more than two years ago, economy
ministry officials said.
   Carlos Carballo, undersecretary of economy, confirmed that
payments were renewed following "arduous" discussions in New
York between Central Bank Vice President Javier Gonzalez
Fraga and individual creditor banks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The interest payment, ministry individuals said, is
considered "a gesture of good will" aimed at aiding Mr.
Gonzalez Fraga in talks that began this week with the
steering committee of a consortium of private creditors.
   Argentina, the developing world's third-largest debtor,
owes a total of $60 billion plus interest arrearages that
could reach $8.5 billion by year end.
   The government, ministry individuals said, hopes to
negotiate an agreement to pay $300 million in overdue
interest by year end. Creditors reportedly have sought
payment of $500 million. If negotiators reach an agreement,
Argentina would make another interest payment of between $70
million and $80 million.

   Soviet Melting Pot? Nyet

   Gone is Nikita Khrushchev's boast that the Soviet peoples
are "merging" and Leonid Brezhnev's claim that they are at
least "converging." The Soviet Union is no melting pot. This
conclusion fairly leaps from comparisons of the 1979 and 1989
census figures in the official yearbook.
   The U.S.S.R.'s total population grew 9% in the 1980s, to
286.7 million in 1989. The Moslem republics grew much faster
than the European: Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Kirghizia and
Tadzhikistan grew 22% to 34%; Azerbaijan, 17%; Kazakhstan,
13%. The European, traditionally Christian regions grew at
less than the Soviet average: the Russian Republic,
Byelorussia and Estonia by 7%; Latvia, 6%; the Ukraine, 4%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Few Central Asians move to the Russian countryside, which
is badly in need of strong young workers. Instead, Central
Asia's already overcrowded rural communities are becoming
still more populous, a trend aggravated by military force
reductions. Since Central Asians don't move around much, they
intermarry very little with other ethnic groups. In four
Central Asian republics roughly 95% of the natives marry
other natives. Even though more Russians than Kazakhs live in
Kazakhstan, Kazakhs still tend to marry other Kazakhs.
   There is a trend away from intermarriage across the Soviet
Union. In the Baltic states, as in Central Asia, the share of
in-group marriages has increased since 1978. In Lithuania, it
is up to 94% from 92%; in Estonia, to 91% from 90%; in
Latvia, with the lowest rate of the Soviet republics, such
marriages increased by slightly less than 1%, to 80%. Nearly
all Armenian men living in Armenia marry Armenian women --
98%. Even in the Russian Republic, which draws students and
workers from many parts of the country, roughly 90% of
Russian men marry other Russians. In Russia as in most of the
republics the ratio of women marrying their own nationality
is slightly lower than these figures for men.
   Some minorities do not hold their own. Tatar males, living
in their own "Autonomous Republic" enveloped by Russia, marry
their own kind only 61% of the time -- down from 70% a decade
before. The shrinking number of Jews creates pressure on that
group too for intermarriage: Only 27% of Jewish men in the
Russian Republic marry Jewish women -- down from 41% in 1978.
   Unlikely to marry each other, Soviet citizens are growing
apart in other ways too. European Soviets are becoming more
citified. The most urbanized republics are the Russian (74%),
Estonian (72%) and Latvian (71%), while the Central Asian
republics and Moldavia are only 33% to 47% urban. Of the 29
cities with more than a million residents, only five have
many Moslems: Tashkent, Baku, Alma-Ata, Kazan and Ufa.
   The predominately rural women of Central Asian are also
extremely fertile. They have about five children on the
average, compared with just over two in Byelorussia, the
Ukraine, the Baltic and Russian republics. The more urbanized
European regions are likely to have low or no population
growth, while Central Asia's soars. Government subsidies for
larger families have spurred fertility slightly in some
European republics, but the trend line for Central Asia has
shot off the chart.
   The same rural poverty that leads Central Asians to have
so many children also shortens their life spans. As of 1989
the average Soviet citizen lived to 69.5 years (64.8 for the
average man, and 73.6 years for the average woman, despite
her many chores). As Moscow's demographers acknowledge, the
average life span in the Soviet Union is five to eight years
shorter than it is in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan.
Comparisons for Turkmenia, Moldavia, and Kirghizia are even
less favorable: their life spans average only 66 to 68 years.
   Soviet authorities now also admit that mortality rates
increased throughout the U.S.S.R. in the second half of the
1960s and throughout the 1970s, as rampant alcoholism led to
industrial accidents and other health problems. The State
Committee makes the dubious claim that the anti-alcohol
campaigns started in mid-1985 quickly produced a 1.8-year
gain in average Soviet life spans, but it concedes that these
gains, whatever they were, halted after early 1986.
   Moslem Central Asia suffers less from alcoholism than
European Russia, but much more from infant mortality: In
Tadzhikistan at least 49 of 1,000 children die in their first
year, compared with 11 in Latvia and 19 in Russia. The Soviet
average is 24.7 per 1,000 -- still 2.5 to five times higher
than in many "developed capitalist countries," the State
Committee says, complaining that Soviet figures have shown
little improvement in the past decade.
   In principle the Soviet Union should be able to draw upon
the strengths of Europe, Asia and the Transcaucasus; on the
traditions of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism and
other religions; on cultures as diverse as Georgian and
Mongolian. In practice this diversity yields not synergy but
entropy.

   It says all you need to know about creative thinking in
Washington that the man who's written the education book of
the year couldn't get a job in the Bush administration.
   John Chubb, co-author (with Terry Moe) of an icon-smashing
book on school reform to be released today, was close to
being hired by the White House last year as its chief
education aide. The news somehow leaked to the press, and
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos protested to the White
House. Policy director Roger Porter says he admires Mr. Chubb
and Mr. Cavazos's opinion was "only one of many factors," but
Mr. Chubb still didn't get the job. His revenge now is that
his book will do more to improve the nation's schools than
will the least influential cabinet officer since Margaret
Heckler.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That book, "Politics, Markets, and America's Schools,"
goes beyond the routine lament of failure. It explains why
even a decade of reform has failed. The authors finger the
bureaucracy and special interests that can calcify in the
joints of democracy. The failure lies with what is in effect
a socialist education system, controlled, from the top down,
by those with little incentive to change. The only solution
is "bottom-up accountability." That means creating a market
-- with universal public "scholarships" that would let
parents choose, or start, their own schools.
   The Chubb-Moe book is drawing special notice because its
sponsor, the Brookings Institution, is a liberal think tank
endorsing what is supposed to be a "conservative" idea. But
old stereotypes are falling in more places than Moscow. Even
many liberals are rethinking their traditional faith in the
bureaucratic, special-interest state. The metaphor of
"perestroika" applies here too. Some liberals are like
Soviets who've discovered that statism no longer serves even
the goal of equity.
   Mr. Chubb, a scholar of "liberal instincts" (his phrase),
says his own concern grew out of the failure of public
education to serve the urban poor. After 10 years studying
more than 20,000 educators and students at 500 high schools,
he became convinced that only radical "choice" will allow
reform to succeed. His conviction is now being endorsed in
small, grass-roots experiments from Cambridge, Mass., to East
Harlem, to Milwaukee.
   Needless to say, the Bush administration is not leading
this charge, and Mr. Cavazos seems barely to have noticed.
Aides insist he's a stalwart for choice, pointing to five
regional conferences he attended a year ago, but his recent
support is so quiet as to be undetectable.
   He last devoted a speech to choice in November. When
Milwaukee reformer Polly Williams visited Washington, Mr.
Cavazos couldn't fit her into his busy schedule. (This is the
same man whose "outreach" is praised by education lobbyists.)
Sources say he's also demoted his special adviser on choice,
John Klenk, who favors more aggressive leadership. (Mr. Klenk
won't comment, and Undersecretary Ted Sanders says Mr. Klenk
has been transferred but still does the same work.)
   Defenders say it's a matter of style, that Mr. Cavazos
prefers building "consensus" to confrontation. But after 10
years of debate, whatever consensus is possible already
exists. When Brookings and the Heritage Foundation agree, the
debate on substance is over. What's missing now is the
political will to challenge the interests (unions and
bureaucracy) that will never agree because their monopoly on
power is at risk.
   Listen to Debra DeLee, lobbyist for the National Education
Association, the Politburo of the education establishment.
Mr. Cavazos's support for choice, she says, "has been much
more low-key than we expected." She praises Mr. Cavazos for
adopting NEA language about school "restructuring" and
"site-based management" -- jargon for tinkering around the
edges of the system. Mr. Cavazos is at best timid, at worst a
cipher for the educators who've caused the current crisis.
   The White House has been better, which is not to say good
enough. President Bush has praised Polly Williams (thanks to
aide Jim Pinkerton), but choice was barely mentioned at his
"education summit" with governors last fall.
   The administration hails "choice," but in a generic sense
that can be sapped of real meaning. In particular, it won't
explicitly endorse choice involving private schools. Yet Mr.
Chubb says that choice among existing public schools alone is
mere "Soviet-style choice." A market can only liberate if the
supply of schools can also be increased. That means including
private schools, or at the very least breaking all barriers
to the creation of new public schools.
   The Bush team has stressed national testing in a few
subjects, a modest reform but also one that by itself can be
co-opted by education's "nomenklatura". Many administrators
and politicians will begin to gear instruction to satisfy
tests, not students or parents. In the current system, tests
could become as deceptive as Soviet five-year plans.
   The federal role in education is blessedly small, so Mr.
Chubb's most important readers are spread across America. But
that only underscores the abdication when Mr. Cavazos mutes
his only real power, the stature to speak the blunt truth of
the sort offered by John Chubb. George Bush seems unlikely to
be the education president with this education secretary.

   STAMFORD, Conn. -- Strong first-quarter growth at
International Business Machines Corp. helped the information
industry buck a two-year slowdown, according to a report by a
market-research firm here.
   Gartner Group Inc. said IBM's 9.2% revenue growth during
the period beat the industry rate for the first time in five
years. That performance led to a reversal of the industry's
two-year trend toward slower growth: Gartner said revenue
posted a 7.7% gain from the year-earlier period, compared
with 5.5% year-to-year growth in the fourth quarter of 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Gartner noted that industrywide profits declined
slightly, to 6.6% from 6.7%. It attributed the drop to a
continuing mainframe-computer price war, a move away from
proprietary systems, and a shift to smaller, less profitable
computers.
   Gartner added that the shift to smaller computers has
affected the software market markedly, with companies that
cater to the desktop market taking share away from mainframe
and minicomputer software vendors.
   Gartner also noted explosive growth in cellular-telephone
subscriptions, and "hearty" growth by several microchip
concerns. The company compiled its data from 221 publicly
held corporations in data processing, telecommunications and
electronic components.

   Who's News:
   Smithkline Beecham Selects Leschly
   To Run Its Pharmaceutical Business

   LONDON -- SmithKline Beecham PLC named Jan Leschly, the
former president of Squibb Corp., to run its world-wide
pharmaceutical business after John Chappell resigned in a
dispute over management philosophy.
   The health-care giant's decision to hire a highly
respected outsider for the post may quell investor doubts
about SmithKline Beecham, one of the boldest mergers in a
recent wave of drug-industry consolidations. Danish-born Mr.
Leschly, 49 years old, also will have a good shot at
succeeding Robert Bauman, SmithKline Beecham's chief
executive officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Bauman, 59, revived the earnings momentum of Britain's
Beecham Group PLC before its merger last summer with
SmithKline Beckman Corp. of Philadelphia. Some analysts
expect the go-getter American chief executive to seek a fresh
challenge in a year or two when he finishes the difficult
integration. The marriage's much-touted synergy is emerging
slowly. For example, in trying to trim its heavy debt and to
focus on health care, SmithKline Beecham searched for nine
months before finding a buyer for the first part of its
cosmetics business.
   Mr. Leschly "is obviously a prime candidate" to succeed
Mr. Bauman, said Erling Refsum, an analyst at Nomura Research
Institute in London. "He has run a major pharmaceutical
company before." Concurred Viren Mehta, a drug-industry
consultant based in New York: "It (the appointment)
strengthens their management team and offers a possible
succession planning" with a man who "has a strong grasp of
the pharmaceutical industry."
   Mr. Leschly, a former tennis professional, quit as
Squibb's president and chief operating officer last fall
after it merged with longtime U.S. rival Bristol-Myers Co. "I
worked very hard for Squibb," he recalled in an interview
yesterday. But "I wasn't part of the acquiring company."
   Mr. Leschly said he made about $1 million a year at
Squibb. A SmithKline Beecham spokeswoman said he won't take a
pay cut in his new job, but declined to disclose his new
salary.
   During his 10-year tenure in various Squibb executive
posts, Mr. Leschly earned industry kudos for overseeing its
introduction of Capoten, a heart drug that's now the second
biggest-selling prescription medicine in the world.
   Drug analysts expressed hope that he may help SmithKline
Beecham find a similar blockbuster and relieve investor
concerns about the marriage's long-term payoff. No major drug
looms to replace Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham's biggest
moneymaker. The $1 billion anti-ulcer drug is threatened by
slowing U.S. sales and world-wide patent expirations starting
next year in West Germany.
   Analysts also were encouraged by the departure of Mr.
Chappell, 53, who joined SmithKline in 1962. His resignation
will lead to "a further upgrading in the price of the stock,"
said James Keeney, head of health-equities research at Mabon,
Nugent &amp; Co. in Boston. "The guys who presided over the
decline of Tagamet are no longer in charge."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
SmithKline Beecham American depositary shares rose 75 cents
to close at $47.25.
   Mr. Chappell had run the pharmaceutical business since the
merger's completion last summer. In a phone interview
yesterday, he said he stepped down from the $500,000-a-year
post because of differences with Mr. Bauman and SmithKline
Beecham Chairman Henry Wendt over "fundamental philosophy,
rather than (over) the nuts and bolts of managing the
business." There was "a lack of alignment" over values, he
went on, while declining to be more specific. "When that
happens at the top of the house, you really have to do
something about it."
   Mr. Bauman wasn't available for comment. But the
SmithKline Beecham spokeswoman described the disagreement as
"differences in how they would structure management of the
business."
   In addition to appointing Mr. Leschly, SmithKline Beecham
promoted Frederick Kyle, president of its U.S.
pharmaceuticals business. Mr. Kyle, 57, assumes the new
position of president for the drug business's commercial
operations world-wide.

   PARIS -- In a further sign of warming East-West relations,
the U.S. and its 16 main Western allies agreed to ease their
41-year-old embargo on sales of high-technology products to
the East bloc.
   The agreement, reached at a two-day meeting of allied
officials here, authorizes a major liberalization of
technology-trade restrictions to the East. All export curbs
will end for most Western personal computers and other
commonly available technology products. More important, the
allies agreed to greatly reduce restrictions on sales of
mainframe computers, telephone exchanges, machine tools and
other more-sophisticated products.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The accord, based on a Bush administration proposal
announced May 2, opens the door to East-West trade in a wide
range of technology products. As one indication of the
accord's importance, U.S. officials said the products
involved currently make up about $45 billion, or 30%, of
annual U.S. technology exports around the world. The East
hasn't enough hard currency to place orders anywhere near
that volume. But Western businesses expect the accord to
allow a gradual rise in direct sales to the East, and an
immediate surge in East-West technology joint ventures.
   Many Western businesses cheered the accord, even though
some had urged even greater liberalization. "We are very
pleased," said a spokesman in Armonk, N.Y., for International
Business Machines Corp. "This represents substantial
progress." An official of the West German Industry Federation
called the accord "a step forward" in East-West trade.
   The pact also was attacked by some U.S. conservatives.
This "ill-advised" accord will "enable the Soviets for far
less {effort} to field far more capable military forces in
the future," said Frank Gaffney Jr., a former Pentagon
official who heads the Center for Security Policy, a
conservative Washington think tank.
   Before sales can begin, the agreement has to be
implemented by laws or rules in each of the 17 countries
participating in the trade organization, called the
Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or
Cocom. The 17 countries are the U.S., Japan, Australia, and
all of the West European countries except Iceland that belong
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who helped craft the
U.S. proposal to Cocom, said the U.S. strategy of
"differentiation" prevailed over West European plans to treat
the Soviet Union and the East European countries essentially
the same way. Cocom's decision to reward the more-democratic
Eastern European countries with higher technology could
induce the Soviets to "move towards the same direction," he
said.
   Mr. Mosbacher said he expects both the former East bloc
nations and U.S. companies to take advantage of the
opportunities being opened. "American companies are going to
leap into Eastern Europe," he predicted. And their presence
could help to "jump-start" those nations' economies.
   The success of the Paris meeting proves that Cocom is
"very much alive," he said. Cocom will have to closely watch
how the special provisions for East Germany work, but after
the two Germanys unite they will be "treated like any other
Cocom member," he said.

   U.S. Forest Service
   Plans a Cutback
   In Logging Allowed

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Forest Service plans a significant
cutback in logging in national forests over the next five
years while putting greater emphasis on recreation and
wildlife protection.
   The annual harvest of timber in national forests averaged
12.2 billion board feet from 1983 through 1988, but it will
fall to 10.8 billion board feet by 1995 under the Forest
Service's new master plan for managing its vast domain of
natural resources. The annual harvest rate won't be restored
to the 12 billion board feet range until the year 2040,
despite a projected 79% increase in demand for hardwoods and
a 35% increase for softwoods by then.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agency also plans to permit less livestock grazing on
national forest land, an important source of pasture for the
nation's cattle and sheep industries.
   "We are looking at multiple-use management from a new
perspective," said Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
"Where timber and mineral production and livestock grazing
cannot be accomplished in an environmentally acceptable
manner, production levels will be reduced."
   Representatives of the timber industry warned that the
plan will only aggravate tight timber supplies, particularly
in the Pacific Northwest. Luke Popovich, spokesman for the
American Forest Council, dismissed the Forest Service's
projections as "essentially useless" because they ignore such
critical factors as the anticipated listing of the rare
northern spotted owl as a threatened species. The industry
fears the listing will trigger logging bans across large
sections of northern California, Oregon and Washington. The
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is due to rule on the owl's
status by June 23.
   The Forest Service's five-year plan calls for greater
environmental sensitivity and a better balance among multiple
uses of public lands. Among other things, the agency intends
to permit 49% less clear-cutting of national forests by 1995.
   Clear-cutting, unlike selective cutting of trees, is
regarded as environmentally harmful because it causes soil
erosion and destroys wildlife habitat. The plan also
strengthens the Forest Service's commitment to protecting
"special places" and expanding wilderness areas.
   Under the new plan, the Forest Service projects its annual
costs will hit $3 billion by 1995. Last year, its programs
cost $2.3 billion. Jobs created by Forest Service activities,
including logging, are expected to total 623,000 by 1995, up
49,000 from 1989.

   PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp. said 57.1% of its shareholders
rejected a proposal by New York investor Carl Icahn to spin
off at least 80% of the company's steel operations.
   The preliminary count of the May 7 balloting showed that
75,021,397 shares, or 42.9% of shares cast, voted in favor of
the plan, including Mr. Icahn's 33.9 million shares. About
28.4 million shares abstained. Mr. Icahn proposed shedding
steel operations, with shareholders receiving a dividend for
that business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "In rejecting Mr. Icahn's call to spin off the steel
business as a dividend, the shareholders have decisively
supported our policy of well considered and prudent corporate
change," said USX chairman Charles A. Corry.
   Mr. Icahn said his proposal failed because a handful of
institutions, while agreeing with his goal, voted with the
company because of "strong indications" that management would
undertake a restructuring. They were afraid, he said, "a
positive vote might have the `backlash' effect of restricting
their methods of restructuring."
   The company won all but two of the 11 proposals before
shareholders. In those two instances, shareholders favored
the right to vote on the company's shareholder rights plan
and the right to keep votes confidential. Both proposals were
recommendations and, as such, aren't binding. But they likely
will be reviewed by the board.
   Mr. Icahn said he was "particularly interested" in the
company's response to what is "now a shareholder mandate to
remove or submit to a vote the company's `poison pill.'"

   The federal government's top expert has determined that
animal-rights activists can be bad for your health. Health
and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan says their
often-violent threats to necessary animal research delay
cures for many serious diseases. He complained about "major
disruptions to science by so-called animal activists who are,
in fact, nothing more than animal rights terrorists."

   REP. JAMIE WHITTEN: Are you aware of any agreement, any
assurance, by yourself or anyone else in high government
office, to Khrushchev that if he would withdraw at the time
under the conditions that you showed us, the U.S. would
thereby commit itself to any particular course of action?
   SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ROBERT MCNAMARA: I am not only
unaware of any agreement, it is inconceivable to me that our
President would enter into a discussion of any such
agreement. Moreover, there were absolutely no undisclosed
agreements associated with the withdrawal of the Soviet
missiles from Cuba.

   In a recent book, McGeorge Bundy calls Mr. McNamara's
premeditated lie to a congressional committee "most justified
deception." The country eventually learned that President
Kennedy had agreed to remove Jupiter missiles from Turkey in
exchange for the Soviets ending the missile crisis. "There
certainly would have been criticism from hardliners in the
U.S.," Mr. Bundy wrote, but "the assurance itself and the
secrecy with which we surrounded it were justified."
   ---
   Justified or not, no independent counsel ever prosecuted
Mr. McNamara. John Poindexter is not so lucky. On Monday,
Judge Harold Greene must decide his proper punishment. Mr.
Poindexter was not charged with any understandable crime --
Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh didn't allege that the
diversion of Iran arms sales to the Contras broke any law --
but with conspiracy and misleading and obstructing Congress.
For this he could get 25 years and a $1.25 million fine.
   Judge Greene may feel under some pressure to make Mr.
Poindexter the first Iran-Contra defendant sent to jail. On
the other hand, as the AT&amp;T judge who oversees the U.S.
telecommunications industry, Judge Greene hardly needs to
prove that he is energetic. But to imprison Mr. Poindexter
would most certainly align the federal judiciary on the side
of congressional criminalizing of policy differences with the
executive branch.
   Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh, who has so far spent
more than $28 million, has filed papers demanding that Mr.
Poindexter go to jail. "If, as occurred in this case,
high-ranking officials of one branch of government feel free
to feed the other branch a diet of lies," Mr. Walsh wrote in
high dudgeon, "then the constitutional system will surely
sicken and, eventually, die."
   Mr. Walsh didn't show any such concern about lying by his
clients, the Members of Congress who created his job and to
whom he must report. While Judge Greene required former
President Reagan to testify, he upheld the prosecutor's
objection to the Poindexter request that some 65 Members of
Congress and their staffers testify about what they knew
about Iran-Contra and when they knew it. In so doing, Judge
Greene accepted Mr. Walsh's argument that it was irrelevant
to argue that Members of Congress lied when they said they
were misled about Oliver North's work for the Contras.
   Mr. Poindexter testified to Congress that the executive
branch was abiding by the letter and spirit of the Boland
amendments. His meaning was clear to everyone. Congress had
voted down bills that would have barred all U.S. government
aid to the Contras. The Boland compromise was that the CIA
and other agencies were prohibited from using appropriated
funds to help the Contras, but the White House and its
National Security Council could strive to keep the Contras
alive. As President Reagan testified, he would have sent a
similar letter to Congress except that "If I had written it
myself, I might have used a little profanity."
   A National Security Agency staffer testified in the
Poindexter case that there were several secret congressional
briefings during the Boland period about executive-branch aid
to the Contras. Still, Rep. Lee Hamilton testified that
Boland was drafted to cover Mr. North. We don't think Mr.
McNamara, Mr. Poindexter or Members of Congress should go to
jail for these kinds of misleading statements. Does anyone
think we should have indicted Members of Congress who failed
to deliver on promised spending cuts after President Reagan
raised some taxes early in his term? Should we criminalize
assurances by Congressmen that the pending "civil rights"
bill won't create quotas? In our system, voters not jurors
decide when officials need to be punished for their policies.
   So what is suitable punishment for Mr. Poindexter? Mr.
North was fined and sentenced to community service fighting
drugs in Washington. How about sentencing Mr. Poindexter to
community service lecturing on separation of powers to the
new democratic government in Nicaragua that he did so much to
make possible.

   Brazilians Find Economic Purgatory in Paradise Lost

   SAO PAULO -- In typical Brazilian fashion, Jarbas Rezende,
a local businessman, tries to capture with a joke the mood of
his crisis-torn country and its latest, most dramatic
austerity plan: "Adam and Eve had no house. They had no
clothes. Just an apple. And they thought they were in
Paradise. They must have been Brazilian]" Everyone at the
business meeting laughs.
   Yet not everyone is laughing in Brazil these days. Luz
Wright, a Brazilian married to an American, titters a moment
and then reacts seriously to the joke: "I don't think
Brazilians think they live in paradise any more. It used to
be paradise, but it has changed. Brazil has troubles."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The troubles are deep and serious: persistent and
explosive inflation, currency constantly shrinking in value
and being reissued, growing poverty, a massive and hurting
informal economy, entrenched state subsidies and privileges,
fragile institutions in a democracy still finding its way
after a generation of military rule, and a spreading sense of
alarm and despair.
   Neide de Paula Santos and her family are a bizarre example
of many of Brazil's troubles. They have just moved into a new
house they built on land given them by the local government.
The two-bedroom home is three times larger than the shanty
they lived in, but it has no electricity, no sewer hookup, no
water and no heat. Mrs. de Paula Santos and her husband are
both unemployed and -- because of layoffs caused by the
austerity plan -- have no prospects for employment soon. So
their new home has no wooden floors nor glass in the windows.
To keep occupied, Mrs. de Paula Santos plays dominoes in the
afternoon.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello used his election
mandate to launch the toughest assault on Brazil's problems
in its history: freezing wages, prices and financial assets,
creating yet another new currency and initiating a variety of
tax measures to curb the public deficits. And despite
widespread complaints and world-wide skepticism, the Collor
Plan (which started March 16) is biting hard and enjoys a
remarkable degree of public support. A recent survey by the
Institute Brasileiro de Opiniao Publica in Rio de Janeiro,
shows 74% of the electorate support the plan (18% don't), the
president has the confidence of 67% of the voters and would
get 61% of the vote if elections were held today. The survey,
unlike earlier ones, sought to reflect all the voters, not
just people who live in urban centers.
   The high degree of support is surprising in the face of a
recession that moves unevenly across the economy. It reflects
a grudging acceptance of the fact that Brazil faced certain
financial doom if it continued its wild course of the 1980s.
A new mood of personal discipline is replacing the profligate
ways of the recent past. During a recent strike of
transportation workers in Rio, clerks at the daily Journal of
Brazil walked to work. "Up to 20 kilometers," says an amazed
Marcus Sa Correa, the editor. "Five years ago, that wouldn't
have happened. They'd have stayed home."
   Now that inflation is reduced, "People are thinking more
about the cost and benefits of what they buy," says Julia de
Carvalho Filho, a Sao Paulo working mother of three. "In my
house, we used to buy five or six of things. We'd stock up.
We'd reach in the closet and get the next one. When the
toothpaste was hard to squeeze, we'd throw it out. Now we buy
one tube at a time."
   Whether the Collor Plan ultimately succeeds or not -- and
government freezes rarely do -- it seems to be changing the
attitude of many Brazilians: They seem sadder, wiser,
soberer. Is a sometimes-juvenile country coming of age and
reaching a new maturity?
   Success of the plan is far from certain. Brazilian
congressmen, facing elections in the fall, are a major threat
to the program. They face strong pressure from workers and
unions as the plan continues to cut into the purchasing power
of paychecks (already reduced up to 60% since March 16,
according to some calculations). Labor observers expect a
wave of strikes in the fall.
   To pave the way for cost-of-living increases, Congress
voted to set aside President Collor's temporary order that
barred wage increases. The president immediately reissued a
new 30-day temporary order. The attorney general now is
taking sides with Congress, asserting the "reissued"
temporary order violates Brazil's new constitution. The case
is now before the Supreme Court.
   Many small businesses are hurting. At one machine-parts
factory in Sao Paulo, customers aren't taking delivery of
parts previously ordered so the parts lie wrapped up on a
shelf. In the informal sector, which may support as many as
50 million Brazilians, sales are slumping. The Collor Plan
requires all transactions to have receipts for payments. The
small-business men who normally buy in the informal sector
are turning away because the marginal suppliers won't provide
the receipts the government requires. The little businesses
don't want to give the receipts because they can't afford to
pay taxes.
   But pressures abound for the government to give ground,
and it has. At the start of this month, elderly people and
certain others got concessions, freeing up funds frozen in
banks. The nation's money supply shrank dramatically in the
first three days of the plan, and is now working its way back
to about 80% of its pre-plan level. Some experts fear it may
be growing at a faster rate.
   So far, however, there is little sign of one of the
primary offshoots of repressed inflation: Few basic goods are
in short supply. The shelves of a supermarket in central Sao
Paulo are adequately, if not abundantly, stocked, and the
lines at the checkout counter are relatively short. To keep
supplies of vegetable oil ample, the government allowed the
prices to rise. One basic in short supply is black beans, a
staple that is mixed with rice. But the cause may be export
demand from Cuba and other customers, not the Collor Plan.
Some prices seem to be tumbling, but this seems more illusion
than reality. Many merchants raised prices sharply before the
plan was announced, and now aggressively advertise "Super
sales . . . up to 50% discount" and "40% discount for cash"
to stimulate sales without really cutting prices.
   To many Brazilians, the Collor Plan offers a last chance.
"I'm trying to be as optimistic as possible," says a
secretary in Rio. "The problem is there is so much to be
done." Some journalists and intellectuals speculate about a
restive military waiting in the wings ready to move in if the
Collor Plan fails. But most Brazilians agree with Journal of
Brazil Editor Sa Correa: "Impossible. There is no
international support for the military anymore. It is
finished."
   Currently everything in Brazil seems to ride so totally on
the success of the Collor Plan that all conversations with
thoughtful Brazilians end with a plaintive -- almost
desperate -- plea: "The plan needs time and must work.
Because if it fails . . . " For the sake of all Brazilians,
especially the half who live on $800 a year or less, one can
only hope Brazil's apparent new maturity prevails.

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
</IN>
<LP>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., hoping to turn around some troubled
brands in its food division, is expected to unveil soon
several new health-oriented products.
   The trend toward healthier, lighter eating will result in
new product initiatives in its lagging Duncan Hines baking
mixes, said Edwin L. Artzt, chairman and chief executive
officer. "We're not putting Band Aids on the business," he
asserted.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Instead, Mr. Artzt suggested P&amp;G will introduce a line of
lower calorie, basic mixes, such as brownies and muffins. "We
want to get back to the basics," he said. Consumers have
wanted "better reasons to keep baking."
   P&amp;G has been a "little heavy footed" in developing
healthier formulas for its Crisco brands of shortening and
oil and the baking mixes, "which is unfortunate when you
consider that we're the company that invented olestra," he
said. Olestra, a fat substitute, awaits approval by the Food
and Drug Administration.
   Cincinnati-based P&amp;G is taking these steps to help build
up its food and beverage business, which had a $14 million
pretax loss in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1989. Although
P&amp;G's Folger's coffee and Jif peanut butter are profitable,
the company lost money on its Citrus Hill orange juice last
year.
   The company recently changed the brand's name, formula and
packaging. Mr. Artzt expects sales of the brand's
calcium-added juices to pick up as more clinical studies
confirm the product's effect on building bones.
   Citrus Hill ranks third behind industry leaders Tropicana
and Minute Maid. If it can't be salvaged, Mr. Artzt said he
hasn't ruled out the option of selling it and focusing only
on the fruit drink segment with brands such as its Sunny
Delight and Hawaiian Punch. "That's an option for the
future," he added.
   It's unclear how fast P&amp;G will make that decision,
although Mr. Artzt said he has given the unit a "reasonable
time frame" to fix the problems. But he quickly added: "I'm
not a patient fellow."
   Mr. Artzt said P&amp;G's sharpest growth is coming from hair
care and skin care products, such as Pert Plus, a shampoo and
conditioner, and Oil of Olay, a line of skin lotions. "Most
parts of our business are in some stage of growth with good
global potential," he said. "We don't expect any part of our
business to stagnate in the next decade."
   That growth won't stem from hefty increases in marketing
spending, however. "I have no particular interest in seeing
us increase our investment in marketing," he said.
   Instead, he wants to shift current spending more toward
advertising and less on promotions. While promotions give
short-term volume gains, they can erode consumer loyalty, he
believes. "Sometimes our people are even tempted to believe
that if they don't have particularly strong advertising copy,
it's better not to spend money in advertising," he said. "I
preach the doctrine that halitosis is better than no breath
at all."
   In detergents, P&amp;G sees promise in results of its Phoenix,
Ariz., test market of its super-concentrated detergents, sold
under the "Ultra" Cheer, Tide, Gain and Oxydol brand names.
P&amp;G has expanded the test market to Texas and New Mexico.
   In Japan, those products now account for 80% of the
detergent market, he said. While U.S. consumers say they want
the environmental and convenience advantages of the products,
he doesn't expect domestic sales to go "as far and fast as in
Japan."
   P&amp;G wants to expand its drug and health care business, but
"it's a slower burn deal" because of regulatory clearances
needed. When asked about how P&amp;G will achieve that goal, Mr.
Artzt said "we'll either get there on our own or with the
help of an acquisition."
   Mr. Artzt declined to comment specifically on analysts'
projections for fiscal 1990 earnings, which average about
$4.50 a share. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1989, P&amp;G
reported net income of $1.21 billion, or $7.12 a share, on
sales of $21.4 billion. The year-earlier per-share figure is
before P&amp;G's 2-for-1 stock split in November 1989.
   Mr. Artzt did say P&amp;G's rates of growth "are a little
inflated" because of some nonrecurring items in last year's
fourth quarter. The company took a $78 million restructuring
charge and had a higher tax rate in the year-ago fourth
quarter. "Any comparison you want to look at shows our
earnings growth is solid," he said.
   P&amp;G expects to increase its capital spending slightly in
fiscal 1991 and 1992 as it expands capacity at existing
plants and adds facilities. For fiscal 1989, P&amp;G spent $1.03
billion. For 1990, it should continue to be about 5% of
sales, he said.

   $1 Billion of Components
   Under Five-Year Accord

<LP>
   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp., in a symbolically
important step for its expansion into Eastern Europe, said it
has gained a foothold in the Soviet Union's auto industry.
   GM said it bested several competitors to win a five-year
agreement to supply nearly $1 billion of pollution-control
and engine-control parts to Volga Auto Works, or VAZ, the
Soviet Union's largest auto maker. GM said it is also
discussing a possible joint venture with VAZ that would
produce exhaust-scrubbing devices, or catalytic converters,
in the Soviet Union.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Further, GM executive vice president William E. Hoglund
said the VAZ deal, which had been in the works since last
fall, gives GM an avenue to begin negotiating the purchase of
Soviet platinum. The precious metal is critical to the
manufacture of catalytic converters.
   The Soviet Union has the largest platinum reserves outside
of South Africa, which is subject to U.S. trade sanctions for
its apartheid policies and whose white-minority government
faces an uncertain future.
   Mr. Hoglund didn't provide details about payment
arrangements for the new deal, but he said GM expects to be
paid in dollars. However, he added, that hinges on VAZ's
ability to export the cars outfitted with GM's hardware in
return for hard currency payments.
   Since the Iron Curtain began disintegrating late last
year, GM has moved quickly to establish a presence in the
East bloc, outflanking arch-rival Ford Motor Co. and most
other major auto makers.
   The exception is Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, which has
longstanding and extensive auto alliances with the Soviets as
well as auto makers in Poland and Yugoslavia. Since December,
Fiat has broadened its ties with the U.S.S.R. by signing
agreements to help the Soviets design three new cars and set
up factories capable of building 900,000 cars a year. Fiat
and the Soviets also are discussing building an engine plant
and a foundry to supply those cars. Fiat will be a 30%
partner in the manufacture of one of the subcompact car lines
and expects to sell some of the Soviet-made models in Western
Europe beginning in late 1993 or 1994, according to a Fiat
spokesman in the U.S. Fiat values these deals at about $5.8
billion, the spokesman said.
   GM, meanwhile, has signed an accord to build cars in what
is currently East Germany. It has deals to build cars and
parts in Hungary, and plans by the end of the year to have
distributors and dealers in six Eastern European countries.
   By contrast, Ford last year abruptly pulled out of talks
to build cars in the Soviet Union, a move that prompted a
rebuke from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev during his
U.S. visit last week. Moreover, Ford hasn't announced any new
venture in Eastern Europe.
   Ford executives have said they don't want to jump
prematurely into countries that are still in political
turmoil and that have little in the way of convertible hard
currency and consumer markets that are threadbare at best.
   But GM apparently is willing to join Fiat in gambling on
an East bloc market renaissance.
   At a news conference, Mr. Hoglund made it clear that GM is
as excited about the long-term strategic possibilities of its
Soviet venture as it is of the relatively modest parts deal,
which he described as "essentially a purchase order."
   "How long will it take the Russians to build a consumer
market? Who knows?" said Mr. Hoglund, who is in charge of
GM's world-wide parts operations. "But the first company in
the market would have a better opportunity to participate."
   GM plans to begin shipping catalytic converters,
engine-control computers and fuel-injection systems in 1992
to VAZ's factory in Togliatti, about 700 miles southeast of
Moscow. GM expects to ship parts for between 100,000 and
150,000 cars annually over the five-year life of the deal.
   GM will re-engineer its parts to adapt its systems to
VAZ's 1.5 and 1.7-liter engines and will train Soviet workers
to assemble the pieces in the Fiat-derived Lada cars they
build.
   GM's emissions-control technology could be important to
VAZ's export ambitions as Eastern and Western European
countries move to adopt tighter pollution standards, Mr.
Hoglund said.
   Mr. Hoglund acknowledged that the deal carries some risk.
But he stressed that the 150,000 vehicles-per-year volume is
a tiny slice of GM's overall capacity to manufacture
engine-fuel and exhaust-control systems. GM can make such
systems for five million vehicles a year.
   The "biggest impediment" to the deal's success may be the
tangled logistics of communicating with VAZ's Togliatti plant
from GM's European engineering centers in Western Europe, Mr.
Hoglund said.
   "There are so many unknowns in how you do business" with
the Soviets, Mr. Hoglund said.

   Industrials Fall Third Day in Row

   NEW YORK -- Investors, turning more cautious on the
outlook for corporate profits and interest rates, sold stocks
yesterday, sending the market into its third consecutive
decline.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.32 to 2897.33.
The last string of three declines in the industrial average
occurred on April 20, 23 and 24, part of a five-session drop
in the average.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Among the broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
index fell 1.81 to 363.15; the New York Stock Exchange
composite index dropped 0.94 to 198.21 and the Dow Jones
Equity Market index slipped 1.71 to 338.27.
   Volume totaled 160,420,000 shares on the New York Stock
Exchange, where declining issues outpaced advancers, 852 to
638.
   Futures-related sell programs weighed on the market
yesterday. Some big institutional investors are trying to get
out of the June S&amp;P 500 contract and into the September
contract before next Friday's quarterly expiration of
stock-index futures and options, analysts said. They
explained that the profits might be bigger now than if the
investors waited until next week.
   Some technology and energy issues, which led the rally on
various days last month, fell back. Compaq Computer dropped 1
3/8 to 121 3/4 and International Business Machines remained
unchanged at 120 5/8. Exxon fell 1/4 to 47 5/8 on 1.1 million
shares.
   Among other big blue chips: Boeing eased 1 1/8 to 83 7/8,
Merck dropped 1 1/4 to 81 1/2, Coca-Cola Co. fell 5/8 to 44
3/4 and General Motors dropped 1/2 to 49 3/8.
   Yesterday's decline was muted because many investors are
willing to buy at lower prices, said Dan Williams, head of
institutional trading at Dillon Read. "They are not anxious
to chase the market, but buyers are still around," he said.
   One sector in favor yesterday was financial shares,
especially savings and loans. HomeFed rose 1 to 32 3/4 and
Great Western Financial gained 1/4 to 20 1/2.
   J. David Mills, senior vice president at Boston Co.
Advisers, said he has recently bought financial stocks
because many high-quality companies have been beaten down
with the broad sell-off in that sector over the past several
weeks.
   Among his recent purchases are Republic New York Corp.,
Golden West Financial and KeyCorp. However, Mr. Mills remains
defensive on the stock market overall. "The market has a
price-earnings ratio of 16 times earnings and that isn't
attractive; the current rally has a limited lifespan," he
asserted.
   Apparel retailers, a focus of profit-taking earlier in the
week, recorded especially steep losses amid disappointment
with apparel-sales figures for May from the nation's major
retail chains. Gap Inc. plummeted 4 3/8 to 58 1/2 and Limited
Inc. dropped 1 7/8 to 47 3/8.
   Precious-metals stocks were hit with heavy selling as gold
prices remained under pressure. August gold futures fell
below $360 in New York trading, reflecting fears about the
possibility of additional gold-bullion sales by the Soviet
Union and Middle Eastern investors and other factors.
   Battle Mountain Gold tumbled 3/4 to 11 1/2 in Big Board
composite trading of 1.4 million shares -- close to six times
its average daily volume -- while American Barrick Resources

   Takeover Talk Re-Emerges in Britain;
   Mergers Seen Dominating Fewer Deals

   LONDON -- Takeover talk is back in the British market
after more than a half-year's absence, fueled by new and old
rumors and one or two deals.
   But equity analysts don't foresee a rerun of last year's
record level of merger mania -- #26.1 billion ($44.07
billion) in mergers and acquisitions were completed in 1989
-- and are skeptical that the talk will add an extra punch to
the London market's current upward thrust.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The bid business that does get done, analysts say, is more
likely to be through mergers than outright takeovers. With
companies generally short of cash, interest rates high, and
the stock market rallying, share swaps will be back in vogue.
Cash-based acquisitions, which some analysts say accounted
for between 70% and 80% of takeovers in 1989, will be few.
   "The balance sheets in the corporate sector are severely
stretched," implying that the aggressive takeover behavior of
last year won't recur, Richard Kersley, an analyst at
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., said.
   Analysts said Rank Organisation PLC's pending bid for
Mecca Leisure Group PLC on a part share-swap basis typifies
the type of merger activity expected this year. Willis Faber
PLC, a British insurance brokerage, is merging with a U.S.
counterpart, Corroon &amp; Black Corp., through an exchange of
shares.
   Mr. Kersley and other analysts say they expect overall
corporate investment in 1990, including spending on
acquisitions, to fall sharply from year-earlier levels, as
earnings growth slows.
   Randall Goldsmith, an analyst at James Capel &amp; Co.,
estimated that earnings growth for British companies,
excluding the financial and oil sectors, will average 7.4%
this year, compared with 9.4% last year. Though analysts
still consider this pace reasonably buoyant, companies
clearly aren't as well-positioned to launch the staggering
cash-based takeover bids characteristic of 1989. Those
resulted in a net injection of about #15 billion into the
market, according to Glenn Davies, an analyst at Laing &amp;
Cruickshank Ltd.
   Chief among these was the joint #2.04 billion bid by
General Electric Co. -- unrelated to the U.S. company of the
same name -- and Siemens AG of West Germany for Plessey Co.,
and Hanson PLC's #3.5 billion takeover of Consolidated Gold
Fields PLC. A Hoylake Investments Ltd. consortium's #13.4
billion bid for B.A.T Industries PLC also stirred up
excitement, until it ran into trouble late last year.
   While the move on B.A.T failed for reasons of its own,
other takeover attempts stalled for reasons more closely tied
to the economic climate. Perhaps the most significant example
was the failure of a British Airways PLC-backed attempt to
acquire UAL Corp., the Chicago-based parent of United
Airlines, last October for lack of financing. News of that
bid's demise helped push the London market into a slump from
which it only recently recovered.
   But as the British stock market rebounds from recent lows,
the high interest rates and lenders' skittish sentiment that
crushed the British Airways-UAL plan remain. Against that
background, analysts question whether big cash bids backed by
borrowing are feasible.
   Thus, analysts tend to dismiss much of the current bid
speculation, including talk that a private investor group is
eyeing Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries PLC.
   "We wonder if (any bidder) will be able to generate proper
financing," said Ian Brenner, a Kleinwort Benson Securities
dealer specializing in the brewery sector.
   High interest rates -- British base rates are at 15% --
are cited by some analysts as a very real impediment to
takeover business. Debt-financed deals, such as Magnet Group
PLC's management buy-out, proved to be "sobering
experiences," said Mr. Kersley of Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
   But other analysts maintained that high interest rates
don't necessarily have an effect on takeover activity, noting
that rates were already at their current highs in the 1989
third quarter, when takeover activity was intense.
   Indeed, noted Laing &amp; Cruickshank's Mr. Davies, high
interest rates, producing weaker corporate profitability,
could encourage takeovers, as some companies become more
vulnerable to their fitter competitors. But he too cautioned
that such business will be minimal, compared with previous
years. "Until interest rates come down," he said, "don't
expect much takeover activity within the U.K."

   Nynex Says 4,000
   Managers Accept
   Early Retirement

   Nynex Corp. said about 4,000 managers agreed to take early
retirement with special incentives as part of a program to
reduce operating costs.
   The White Plains, N.Y., telecommunications company said it
will take a pretax charge of about $41 million in the second
quarter in connection with the program. In the 1989 second
quarter, Nynex earned $279 million, or $1.42 a share, on
revenue of $3.3 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although the company expects to realize long-term
operating efficiencies and savings, the program has eroded
corporate earnings significantly. Nynex already has taken
pretax charges of $71 million in the 1989 fourth quarter and
$39 million in the 1990 first quarter in connection with the
retirement program.
   Several regional Bell companies, including U S West Inc.
and Bell Atlantic Corp., have taken similar cost-cutting
steps in recent months. The Nynex early-retirement program
began in January.
   In announcing the program's results late yesterday, Nynex
said about 2,100 managers retired from its New York Telephone
Co. subsidiary, about 900 from New England Telephone Co.,
some 600 from Nynex Service Co., and the remainder from other
parts of the business.
   Nynex shares closed at $88, down 75 cents, in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
   A Nynex spokesman said the early-retirement program will
trim the work force to about 91,900 employees. At the end of
1988, the company employed 97,400 people.
   Industry analysts have considered Nynex's work force among
the most bloated of the Bells, and its financial performance
among the poorest. Of the seven regional companies, Nynex
also has the oldest work force. As of December 1989, the
company's average age for telephone workers was 43.
   According to the plan, retiring managers will have five
years added to their ages and services dates in calculating
their pensions. The company said the five-year base salary
used to calculate pensions was permanently shifted to 1983
through 1987, from 1981 through 1985.
   The incentive plan for managers supplemented a plan for
non-management employees that was offered in late 1989. Nynex
said about 1,500 workers retired under that plan.

   Lawrence Sanders has been producing best-selling crime
novels for several years, slickly written books that often
revolve around schemes to separate gullible folk from their
funds.
   Mr. Sanders's latest, "Sullivan's Sting" (Putnam, 348
pages, $19.95), is set in south Florida, represented here as
a veritable wildlife refuge for white-collar scam artists. An
unnamed short-term supra-agency has been set up by the
Justice Department to bust some of the more flagrant
swindlers. The agents' attentions soon focus on David
Rathbone, a handsome and well-tailored manipulator who
specializes in preying upon the elderly rich.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rathbone's credo: "The ignorance and greed of most people
were simply inexhaustible, and a man would be a fool not to
harvest that bounty." His current brainstorm is "The Fort
Knox Commodity Trading Fund," which uses unwitting investors'
cash to buy and sell options and futures in cocaine,
marijuana and heroin.
   Into this shark's pool slithers Rita Angela Sullivan,
beautiful female cop posing as shady lady in order to get
close to Rathbone. The ploy works, and a torrid affair ensues
-- all in the line of duty, Sullivan tells Tony Harker, the
agency boss with whom she also becomes physically involved.
But Harker wonders. In this world-class hustlers' paradise,
even the straightest arrows can get bent.
   Other writers (Ross Thomas, Elmore Leonard, Donald
Westlake) might be more inventive or amusing with such
material, but Mr. Sanders tells a good story in his own
capable way. His smooth-talking players "in the game" are
fascinating to watch as they make their moves on the
"suckers" and "mooches." Rathbone is the most compulsive
cheat of all, a man who doesn't pay for anything if he can
steal it and who skims from his partners' take as a matter of
course.
   Short chapters and a large cast keep the plot moving and
the pages turning. Even the sex scenes are fairly nimbly
handled (although this reader still has trouble accepting the
use of "pleasure" as a verb).
   Like Lawrence Sanders, Joseph Wambaugh has been a
brand-name writer for many seasons, with nearly a dozen
fiction and nonfiction best sellers under his belt. His new
novel, "The Golden Orange" (Perigord Press/Morrow, 317 pages,
$19.95), also is set in a sun-and-money zone: the "gold
coast" of Orange County, Calif., known to the book's local
cops as "le Cote de Fraud."
   Winnie Farlowe was one of those cops, a detective for
nearly 15 years until a back injury forced him into early
retirement and caused a drinking problem he belligerently
denies. Forty, divorced, all but unemployable, Farlowe spends
much of his time swilling Polish vodka at Spoon's Landing, a
local dive filled with relentlessly colorful boozers and
losers.
   There Winnie is sought out by Tess Binder, a beautiful
three-time divorcee apparently attracted by news accounts of
Farlowe's flamboyant escapades. Tess is well-off by Winnie's
standards but poor by her own. Down to her last $50,000, she
keenly feels in need of another wealthy husband, preferably
"F.F.H." (Forbes 400) and "one who would not insist on a
prenuptial agreement."
   However implausibly, the "hot momma" and the ex-cop become
an item. Winnie turns detective again when it seems someone
is stalking Tess with murderous intent. Could this have
something to do with the deferred inheritance left Binder by
her father, a suicide? Or is there much more here than Winnie
Farlowe, "straight-ahead guy," is being told?
   Mr. Wambaugh sketches with broad satiric strokes, and his
often lurid style may take some getting used to. Many of his
characters speak in nearly interchangeable cynical-hip
one-liners, with racist and sexist slurs all part of the
accepted copshop banter. And his prose has a disconcerting
tendency to veer from raw action to intimate musings to
travel-brochure trivia without so much as a hand signal. But
even at its most cartoonish, "The Golden Orange" has its own
sort of charm.
   New to the best-seller lists is Sue Grafton, whose seventh
mystery featuring female Southern California private
investigator Kinsey Millhone, "`G' Is for Gumshoe" (Henry
Holt, 261 pages, $16.95), is proving to be her "breakout"
book.
   Millhone, who narrates her own case reports, is an
extremely likable individual: funny, articulate, tough-minded
and capable. As "Gumshoe" begins, she is having her 33rd
birthday, "after what seemed like an interminable twelve
months of being thirty-two" -- a nice in-joke for faithful
readers aware that the first six books in this alphabetical
series all took place within that one fictional year.
   Two things keep Kinsey busy throughout "Gumshoe": finding
a client's elderly mother gone missing, first from a trailer
home near the Mojave Desert, then from a nursing home in
Kinsey's town of Santa Teresa; and dodging a psychotic hit
man hired by a vindictive convict Millhone helped put away.
   To deal with the hit man, Kinsey enlists the services of
another PI, a no-nonsense cop named Robert Dietz who signs on
as a full-time bodyguard (and, eventually, a bit more).
Meanwhile, the case of the missing mother has Millhone
untangling a deadly chain of events rooted in the past.
   Several elements make "Gumshoe" one of the best entries
yet in this consistently appealing series. The out-of-nowhere
appearances by the assassin -- a spooky guy who brings his
little boy along on jobs -- provide genuine jolts, bursts of
adrenaline that interrupt Kinsey's usual wisecracking mode
and induce a giddy vertigo. The mystery proper has some of
the intriguing qualities of a Ross Macdonald puzzle, dank
with long-buried secrets and lingering guilts.
   Major, minor and recurring characters of all ages are
quirky and vivid, like the ensemble company of the greatest
TV show you'll never see. (Creating interesting and
believable older women and men is something the author is
especially good at.) And Millhone's distinctive running
monologue, full of pithy descriptions and sardonic
observations, pulls all this together in a most engaging
manner.
   Whatever the formula, its entertaining results make Ms.
Grafton's alphabetical "Gumshoe" seem an especially deserving
best seller. May it have at least 19 equally successful
sequels.

   LOS ANGELES -- A manufacturer of parts for microwave
systems has sued Teledyne Inc. for allegedly ruining its
business by buying exclusive rights to certain technology and
then not using it.
   H-U Development Corp., in a complaint filed in Los Angeles
Superior Court, claimed that under a 1989 agreement Los
Angeles-based Teledyne was to pay royalties for use of H-U's
"magnetic switching" technology in new microwave systems that
Teledyne produced. H-U is based in Santa Monica, Calif.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Teledyne spokesman said he hadn't seen the complaint and
declined comment.
   Teledyne, a manufacturing and insurance concern, also
acquired most of H-U's equipment and moved it to San Jose,
Calif., where its microwave division is located, the
complaint said.
   After that, the complaint said, Teledyne didn't allocate
production facilities to the new products, quoted
"ridiculously high" prices and long delivery periods to
potential customers, and continued producing its old systems
without the H-U technology.
   The complaint seeks at least $10 million in compensatory
damages and treble punitive damages.

from 593.2 million a year earlier. A revenue passenger mile
is one paying passenger flown one mile.
   The carrier's May load factor, or the percentage of
available seats occupied, increased to 60.6% from 53.3%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the first five months of this year, America West's
traffic rose 43% to 4.36 billion revenue passenger miles from
3.05 billion a year earlier. The load factor increased to
61.8% from 56.8%.

   Business Brief -- Ipsco Inc.:
   Charge of $16.9 Million
   Is Set for Second Quarter

   Ipsco Inc., a Regina, Saskatchewan, steelmaker, said it
will report a charge of 19.8 million Canadian dollars
(US$16.9 million), or C$1.39 a share, against its
second-quarter net income, as a result of asset write-downs
and severance payments.
   A year earlier, Ipsco earned C$6.8 million, or 48 Canadian
cents a share, on revenue of C$127.9 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said it wrote down the value of its Canadian
assets producing tubular steel products used in the oil and
gas industry, as a result of an expected decline in demand.
The assets had a net book value before the write-down of
C$77.2 million, Ipsco said. Even without the write-down, the
company said it would have recorded a second-quarter loss,
owing to falling sales of flat-rolled steel and a delay in
shipping a large order of large diameter pipe, for
environmental reasons.
   Ipsco said its third-quarter outlook is positive, from the
expected shipment of two large steel pipe orders. But if the
Canadian dollar maintains its high value against the U.S.
currency, Ipsco said its sales to traditional U.S. markets
could be further affected.

   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said it will make a public
offering of 49% of its Hong Kong newspaper business, which
includes the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's largest
English-language daily.
   Sydney, Australia-based News Corp., which said last month
it would sell off an undisclosed portion of South China
Morning Post Holdings Ltd., didn't specify how much it
intends to raise through the offer. The company said it plans
to provide further details Monday at a news conference.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Outside estimates of the newspaper's value range from four
billion to five billion Hong Kong dollars (US$514.1 million
to US$642.7 million). The sale comes as News Corp. attempts
to sell some of its assets to cut the almost $7 billion in
debt created by an aggressive acquisition spree in recent
years.
   News Corp. said it has applied to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange to list the South China Morning Post's entire issued
capital of 1.5 billion ordinary shares. But the company said
it will keep 51% of the shares, retaining the majority
holding.
   The public will be offered 17.5% of the Post's shares,
while an additional 17.5% will be placed with institutional
and professional investors. United Overseas Bank Ltd. has
agreed to acquire a further 9% of the shares, while Singapore
Press Holdings Ltd. will acquire 5%.

   Big Board Still Slogging in Leader Quest

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange is stuck in a
bind, as it attempts to pick a new chief for the first time
in six years.
   Four months after Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. announced he
plans to retire by year end, the Big Board hasn't settled on
a successor and doesn't have a strong frontrunner, people
familiar with the deliberations say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Phelan is increasingly eager to get the matter
resolved soon. But an internal wrangle has emerged about
whether Richard A. Grasso, the exchange's president and chief
operating officer, should be named chairman, rather than a
high-profile outsider.
   Mr. Grasso is well regarded within the securities
industry, but little known outside Wall Street. He initially
wasn't considered a primary candidate for the chairmanship.
   But many Big Board floor traders believe Mr. Grasso has
become a stronger candidate in recent weeks, because the
exchange's selection committee so far hasn't lured a big-name
outsider. Mr. Grasso, with Mr. Phelan's encouragement, has
been trying to strengthen his ties with influential floor
traders and Wall Street executives. As a candidate, "Grasso
is very much bubbling to the top . . . through attrition of
other ingredients in the soup," a top Big Board trader says.
   The problem is that Mr. Phelan, a former trader who wasn't
a prominent name when he took over as Big Board chairman, has
elevated the job into a sort of Wall Street ambassadorship.
Mr. Phelan, for example, played an important public role in
reassuring investors during the October 1987 stock market
crash.
   He has become so well known that many influential members
of the exchange prefer a successor from outside with
comparable weight. Yet many financial heavyweights don't see
the post, in which Mr. Phelan is paid what people at the
exchange say is between $750,000 and $1 million a year, as an
exalted job by Wall Street's lucrative standards.
   People familiar with the deliberations say the Big Board's
eight-member search committee has long had a short list of
celebrated outsiders to whom it would gladly offer the
chairmanship. The committee hasn't made any formal offers,
these people say, but instead is feeling out potential
interest among the candidates.
   One name on the list is Warren Buffett, the celebrated
stock-picker and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Mr.
Buffett declines to comment, but people familiar with the
matter say he doesn't want the job; instead, the exchange has
turned to Mr. Buffett as an informal consultant on potential
candidates.
   Another name on the Big Board's list is Frank T. Cary,
former chairman of International Business Machines Corp. and
a member of the so-called transition committee to find a
successor to Mr. Phelan. Mr. Cary wouldn't comment, but
people say his star has faded because of opposition on the
exchange floor.
   Another person on the list is the investment banker James
D. Wolfensohn; he also declines to comment. Former Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, chairman of the firm that
bears Mr. Wolfensohn's name, also was coveted by the Big
Board until the American Stock Exchange persuaded him
recently to be a board member there.
   It is often difficult to convince top talent to head stock
exchanges. "It's not at all unnatural that the type of
suspects you'd first identify are busy doing something else,"
says Gordon Macklin, former head of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq automated
quotations stock-trading system that competes with the Big
Board.
   "On the other hand," says Mr. Macklin, now chairman of the
securities firm Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc., "the (Big Board)
position is of such economic significance that they can, and
ultimately will, locate a very strong candidate. John did
give them plenty of time."
   The Big Board, which is running head-to-head with the
Tokyo Stock Exchange for the title of the world's biggest,
has a host of thorny issues awaiting its new chairman. These
include a slow but steady loss of trading business to
regional, off-exchange and overseas markets, and a recession
on Wall Street. Last year, the Big Board's earnings plunged
40% to $6.3 million; its return on members' equity sank to
only 2.7% from an average of 11% in the previous four years.
   Mr. Phelan himself has encouraged the perception that,
amid the rapid changes in the securities business, the Big
Board chairmanship has blossomed into a more important job
than it was in past decades. The chairmanship is "a
backbreaking job" these days, Mr. Phelan said in a recent
interview; he suggested that when he leaves, the exchange may
need a new management structure with more than one "chairman
type" at the top.
   Some exchange members still don't see Mr. Grasso as the
solution, though they are comfortable with his overseeing the
exchange's nuts and bolts.
   "The feeling is that (Mr. Grasso) will be a tremendous
support to whoever comes in," says one of the most important
directors at the Big Board, speaking only if he wasn't
identified. "But what we probably need as chairman is someone
with an outside reputation."
   Indeed, the Amex, while no match for the Big Board in
size, has restored some of its stature among Wall Street
executives, after luring former Congressman James R. Jones to
succeed longtime Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. Mr. Jones got Mr.
Volcker to be a board member as a personal favor. The Amex
also has a well-regarded president, Kenneth Leibler.
   Donald S. MacNaughton, chairman of the executive committee
at HealthTrust Inc. and head of the Big Board's search
committee, declined to comment.
   A Big Board spokesman said: "The members of the transition
committee have been diligently and thoughtfully talking to
people throughout the securities industry, as well as key
corporate leaders, for their input. Their work is ongoing,
and when it has been completed, it will be presented to the
full board for their review. There is nothing more we can add
at this time."
   Yesterday, the Big Board, as expected, named as a vice
chairman John S. Chalsty, who is president and chief
executive officer of the securities firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Inc., a unit of Equitable Life Assurance Society of
the U.S. That makes Mr. Chalsty, who retains his Donaldson
Lufkin position, the highest-ranking officer of the exchange
from a large Wall Street firm. Donald Stone, a senior partner
at the exchange specialist firm Lasker, Stone &amp; Stern,
remains the exchange's other vice chairman.
   The exchange's board also elected three new directors to
two-year terms: Philip J. Purcell, chairman of Sears, Roebuck
&amp; Co.'s Dean Witter Financial Services Group Inc.; John L.
Clendenin, chairman of BellSouth Corp.; and Stanley C. Gault,
chairman of Rubbermaid Inc.. And it elected two new directors
to one-year terms: David L. Luke III, chairman of Westvaco
Corp.; and Daniel P. Tully, president of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.

   Economy:
   Businesses Trim
   Plans for Spending
   Due to Uncertainty

   WASHINGTON -- Showing signs of economic uncertainty,
businesses are planning to spend slightly less on plant and
equipment in 1990 than they indicated earlier this year, the
Commerce Department reported.
   Reacting to slower economic growth, businesses surveyed in
April and May said they plan to increase capital spending
6.7% this year, rather than the 7.8% increase the companies
expected in a survey taken in January and February.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I don't think the original survey got the right
estimate," said Aubrey Zaffuto, an economist for IBJ Schroder
Bank &amp; Trust Co. in New York. Ms. Zaffuto said she finds the
latest survey results to be a more realistic estimate of 1990
capital spending, based on the sluggishness of the economy.
   According to the latest survey, businesses plan to spend
$507 billion on plant and equipment this year. While that's
less than the earlier estimate of $512.82 billion, it's up
from the $476 billion businesses spent in 1989, which was up
10.4% from the 1988 level.
   Kris Bledowski, senior economist for Cahners Economics,
said the figures show that businesses are uncertain about the
overall strength of the economy. But he said he looks for
industrial production to pick up, which he said will lead to
an increase in capital spending later this year or early
next.
   After adjusting for inflation, planned spending would
increase 5.5% in 1990, compared with a 7.9% rise estimated in
the earlier survey. The revision reflects an expectation of
higher prices as well as a reduction in dollar outlays.
   Manufacturing industries plan to increase capital spending
3.4% in 1990, compared with a 4.9% rise in the previous
survey. Both figures are substantially lower than the 11%
growth in 1989.
   Makers of durable goods, which are big-ticket products
expected to last at least three years, gave the least
optimistic report, saying they plan to increase outlays this
year by only 2.4%. Faced with the current softness in the
automobile industry, motor-vehicle manufacturers plan to
reduce spending 11.3% in 1990. The largest increases are
planned in fabricated metals and nonferrous metals.
   Manufacturers of non-durable goods had a slightly more
promising outlook, planning to increase capital spending by
4.3% in 1990.

   Here is the breakdown by major industries of capital
spending results for past periods and estimates for current
and future periods. For comparability with annual totals, the
quarterly figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates, in

   Time Warner to Amend Loan to Pathe,
   Which Is Seeking to Acquire MGM/UA

   LOS ANGELES -- Pathe Communications Corp. said Time Warner
Inc. agreed to amend its accord to provide a $650 million
loan to Pathe, which is seeking to acquire MGM/UA
Communications Co. for $1.27 billion. Pathe also gave itself
another week to complete its $20-a-share tender offer for the
studio.
   Observers have been skeptical about the bid by Pathe and
its chairman, Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, but Time
Warner apparently is anxious to do whatever it takes to get
the deal done. The change in the agreement would allow Pathe
to retain more revenue from the new films it would produce
after acquiring the studio, a move that also would make it
easier for Pathe to borrow money.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If the transaction is completed, Time Warner would get
distribution rights to MGM/UA's valuable library and Pathe's
new films in return for the loan. Time Warner has a lien on
the library as security for the loan, and also warrants that
could give it 20% of the new company.
   Pathe also said its offer, which was set to expire
yesterday, has again been extended, this time to June 15. It
can't be extended beyond June 23, according to the initial
purchase pact. Pathe has already deposited $150 million in
cash toward the purchase price, and a fourth $50 million down
payment is due tomorrow.
   The original agreement with Time Warner provided that
Warner Bros. would collect a distribution fee on the library
and Pathe's new films, and that Pathe would be required to
devote 65% of its remaining revenue to repaying the loan. The
amended agreement allows Pathe to retain 100% of the new film
revenues, after distribution fees, though it still must repay
the loan; the agreement on the library revenue remains the
same.
   "This gives us flexibility," said the Pathe spokesman.
   Pathe said it had also obtained a commitment for $125
million in production loans from a bank and was discussing
with Time Warner whether that would fulfill an agreement to
obtain $200 million.
   Pathe also provided details about the additional $450
million to be advanced to Pathe by Luxembourg-based
Comfinance S.A., the closely held vehicle for Mr. Parretti.
First of all, Pathe said it only needed $366 million, not
$450 million, which will be provided in return for stock in
the new company. The funds primarily will come from various
lines of credit from other affiliated companies of Mr.
Parretti.
   The details seem to indicate that Pathe has arranged the
financing without MGM/UA majority shareholder Kirk Kerkorian
having to retain a stake, but an MGM/UA spokesman said Mr.
Kerkorian hadn't made a final decision.
   The Time Warner agreement stipulates that Pathe's
additional funding must be in debt, not equity, and
negotiations with Time Warner are still going on over this
issue, said the Pathe spokesman.
   Although some cynical observers have maintained that Time
Warner's aim is to see Pathe default so it can grab the
library, Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly dismisses the
idea.
   "This is not a deal that we make and hope he goes
bankrupt," said Mr. Daly in an interview recently. "If Pathe
does well and they make eight or ten movies a year, we have a
distribution services agreement with them. So the upside of
this deal could be great and that's what we are really
betting on."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
MGM/UA shares closed unchanged at $18.25, and Pathe shares
fell 37.5 cents to close at $4.

   Management:
   For Chief Executives, Knowing When
   To Leave Post May Be Toughest Decision

   How long should a chief executive officer stay on the job?
   Lee Iacocca's anouncement yesterday that he plans to
remain CEO of Chrysler Corp. beyond his current contract,
which expires at the end of next year, points up the issue of
whether a chief executive can overstay his welcome.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the case of the redoubtable Mr. Iacocca, the question
may appear heretical. For many people, he is Chrysler. He
engineered the auto maker's return from the brink of
bankruptcy. His reputation boosts confidence in Chrysler, and
his public acclaim keeps the company in the spotlight.
   But the events behind his decision -- including last
week's resignation of Gerald Greenwald, Chrysler's No. 2
executive and Mr. Iacocca's former heir apparent -- have
raised warning flags among management specialists.
Consultants and academics -- and even some former chief
executives -- say any veteran CEO (Mr. Iacocca has been on
top for a decade) who is beyond normal retirement age (he
already is 65 years old), without a clear succession plan (he
now has none) and without a fixed retirement date risks
sticking around too long.
   Though they bemoan corporate leaders' focus on short-term
results, many management specialists agree that too much of
even a very good thing can be worse than too little. "It's
likely that more companies are hurt by CEOs staying on too
long a time than by those staying on too short a time," says
Donald Perkins, former chief executive of Jewel Cos.
   The pitfalls include disruption of orderly succession
plans, the danger of losing touch with markets and
technology, and simply growing stale in office. But knowing
how long is too long often is difficult.
   Some argue for lengthy tenures. "From my point of view, 25
years is just about right," says Philip G. Barach, chairman
of U.S. Shoe Corp. He recently stepped down as chief
executive of the troubled Cincinnati company after 22 years
in that post. "You bring out the best in people in a stable
environment."
   Walter Wriston, who headed Citicorp for 17 years until
retiring six years ago at age 65, agrees in principle that
lengthy service is preferable in some circumstances,
including his own. "If a CEO wants to change the culture or
direction of a big corporation, two years is not enough. If
he or she is only there for two or three years, the
organization is looking intently over your shoulder to see
who the next person is coming along."
   Still, even Mr. Wriston has reservations. After too long
at the top, he says, "It's easy to say, `I know the answer to
that,' when the spin that comes over the plate today is
different than on the ball I hit out of the park five years
ago."
   A decade or so seems an ideal tenure to many people. Mr.
Perkins, for instance, stepped down at Jewel after 10 years
when he was only 53. "For most people," he says, "a time
frame of 10 to 12 years is probably appropriate" before they
grow stale. "As I discuss this matter with current and past
CEOs, I find a lot of agreement with that."
   Indeed, according to studies by executive recruiters
Heidrick &amp; Struggles Inc. in Chicago, many leave even sooner.
According to the firm's studies, chief executives' average
tenure fell to 6.4 years in 1987 from 7.6 years in 1977.
   Moreover, in a book on executive succession, Harvard
Business School Prof. Richard Vancil notes that nearly 60% of
chief executives retire when they hit the company age ceiling
at 65 or younger. For the majority of the remainder, terms
are shortened by either failure or the fact that the chiefs
were older than usual when appointed. Only 4% fall into a
category that Prof. Vancil calls "curmudgeons" -- that is,
chief executives who hang on for longer than 12 years.
   Jeffrey Sonnenfeld calls them "monarchs" who won't leave
until they are forced out or die. Mr. Sonnenfeld, director of
the Center for Leadership and Career Change at Emory
University's business school, says monarchs are more common
at smaller companies than larger ones, possibly because big
companies are more likely to have a formal succession policy.
   One big problem is that too-long tenures tend to drive
away successors. "When we hear a CEO bragging to the press
that he is going to stick around for the next five years or
so, we immediately look at who's under him," says Gerard
Roche, chairman of Heidrick &amp; Struggles, the recruiting firm.
   In the case of Chrysler, people close to Mr. Greenwald and
familiar with details of his job switch privately say that
the blocked route to the top of the company was a factor in
his decision to leave to lead a proposed employee buy-out of
United Airlines. Mr. Greenwald says impatience to get to the
top wasn't a factor in his decision. A Chrysler spokesman
said Mr. Iacocca wouldn't comment for this story.
   Older chief executives who show no sign of letting up,
such as 92-year-old Armand Hammer, can thwart aspirants.
During his term as chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp.,
which so far has lasted 33 years, a half-dozen potential
successors have departed, including A. Robert Abboud, now
chairman of First City Bancorp of Texas. Mr. Hammer's current
potential successor, 55-year-old Ray R. Irani, president and
chief operating officer since 1984, was tapped as heir
earlier this year.
   But younger chief executives often block the succession
process even more. "We practically do actuarial tables here,
looking at the ages of CEOs," says Mr. Roche, the Heidrick &amp;
Struggles chairman. "Frankly, the {companies} that are very
good hunting fields for us are the ones where the CEO is
young and there are people around him who are his age."
   Another problem, experts say, is that the longer the
tenure, the greater the chance of facing multiple crises.
Chief executives who put their stamp on a company early on
may be especially handicapped later.
   "Are they able to repudiate themselves?" asks Mary Ann
Devanna, associate dean for executive education at Columbia
University. "It's one thing to come in and say, `This place
is a mess and I'm going to clean it up,' because you have no
ownership in the mess. It's another thing to say, `I've been
in charge of this place for 10 years, and this place has to
go through another revolution.' We don't see much evidence of
people being able to do that."
   Long-term incumbents may have spent political capital
earlier in their career. "Going into any job, you have a pile
of poker chips," says James Buttimer, director of
organizational planning at consultants Arthur D. Little Inc.
"You play through your pile, and after X years your pile is
gone. If you overstay your welcome, you've played out your
chips."
   Mr. Sonnenfeld's research indicates that it seems harder
for an executive to leave a company in trouble. "The greater
the increases in income and in earnings per share in the two
years prior to the leader's retirement, the cleaner the break
from the firm," Mr. Sonnenfeld writes in a book on
executives' departures. Those with lower profit growth
"resisted retirement more."
   Part of the reason might be fear of being blamed. At U.S.
Shoe, the timing of Mr. Barach's resignation as CEO, amid
soft share prices, the failure of a planned unit sale and the
discovery of some accounting irregularities, prompted
speculation that Mr. Barach had been forced out -- which he
vigorously denies.
   At Chrysler, a spokesman says that Mr. Iacocca is still
vital, powerful and effective, and still very much involved
in day-to-day affairs of the company. His visibility among
stock analysts and the public is especially important at a
time when the car maker is being rocked by weak sales and
staff cuts. "He's way at the top of the ladder for Chrysler's
needs," says a spokesman. "He hits the ball right out of the
park."
   Mr. Iacocca has said he isn't indispensable. Still, some
management specialists say the fact that any chief executive
would appear to be indispensable so late in his tenure is a
sure sign of having stayed too long. "Having the players and
the culture in place so that when the CEO goes, the thing has
a strong engine is the ultimate form of leadership," says
John Kotter, a professor at Harvard Business School and
author of several books on leadership. "Anything else,
including turnarounds, is a lesser act."

   Japanese Semiconductor Firms Keeping
   Capital Spending High Despite Outlook

SEMICONDUCTORS, INTEGRATED CHIPS (SEM)
</IN>
<LP>
   TOKYO -- Capital investment plans by Japan's major
semiconductor makers remain strong despite predictions that
the market will show little growth this year.
   According to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics
estimates, semiconductor sales are expected to decline by
about 1% this year, after rising 8.2% in 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite the prospect of slow growth for the near term,
however, Japanese manufacturers aren't trimming their capital
investment plans. Leading makers say they are increasingly
confident that they've passed the worst stage of the "silicon
cycle" between the end of 1989 and the first few months of
1990.
   Rather than cut capital investment for an expected
short-term lull in demand, producers are gearing up for a
battle for the 4-megabit semiconductor market, the latest in
a series of increasingly powerful chips to be mass-produced.
   At present, such Japanese semiconductor makers as Hitachi
Corp., Toshiba Corp. and NEC Corp. are planning to hold
capital investment spending at last year's levels. But
ultimately, investment plans will depend on how quickly the
4-megabit market expands.
   "We're optimistic that the market is gradually on the
upswing," a Hitachi spokesman said. "Depending on market
conditions, we may expand {our capital investment plans}
beyond 95 billion yen." The spokesman said the company is
expecting makers of computers, including personal computers
and workstations, to aggressively incorporate the 4-megabit
chip into their products.
   "We're currently producing 500,000 4-megabit chips a
month. By the summer, we'll expand production to one million
chips a month and by the end of the year, we'll be producing
two million a month," the spokesman added.
   Other chip makers said they're taking a wait-and-see
attitude to see how strongly demand grows.
   "We still don't know how quickly the market {for 4-megabit
chips} will grow," said a spokeswoman for NEC. She said mass
production of 4-megabit chips has just begun, but demand
could prove strong by the second half of the year.
   A Mitsubishi Electric Corp. spokesman said his company had
planned to reduce 1990 capital investment by about 22% on the
belief that the 4-megabit market wouldn't take off until
1991.
   But the spokesman said Mitsubishi Electric will adjust its
spending plans should the 4-megabit market blossom early. In
the end, he said, capital outlays for fiscal 1990 could equal
1989 outlays.
   "Nobody knows what they're going to be producing by the
end of the year," said Steven W. Myers, senior industrial
electronics analyst with Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd. in
Tokyo. With market conditions so unclear, makers can say what
their capacity will be, but they can't say what their
production will be, Mr. Myers added.
   Although rising optimism among Japanese semiconductor
makers could lead to a general increase in capital investment
plans this year, Mr. Myers said he doesn't expect to see
supply far outdistance demand.
   "We're not going to see a war of attrition like we saw in
the mid-80s," Mr. Myers said. He said such a "bloodbath,"
with makers losing heavily as they expanded production in
pursuit of market share, won't be tolerated either
politically or economically this time around.
   Mr. Myers said Japanese makers already cut back production
in late 1989 when supply appeared to be outstripping demand.
   Japanese makers' investment as a proportion of sales this
year will be around 23% to 24%, far below the 40% level in
the mid-1980s, Mr. Myers said.
   He said the strength of Japanese investment in
semiconductor capacity doesn't necessarily imply that U.S.
makers are in danger of being overwhelmed. He said such
leading U.S. players as Motorola Inc., Texas Instruments Inc.
and Intel Corp. have strengths which should give them staying
power in the market.

   NEW YORK -- A third day of selective profit-taking wiped
out an opening surge in stock prices, pushing that market
lower while bond prices inched higher on more evidence of
slowing economic growth.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.32 points to
close at 2897.33 in moderately active trading. Long-term U.S.
Treasury bond prices rose an eighth of a point -- or $1.25
for each $1,000 of face amount -- in light trading. The
dollar was mixed against the mark and the yen, with many
traders awaiting new readings next week on the inflation
rate.

   Money manager Rajiv Sharma, president of Serco
Investments, Sausalito, Calif., was among the stock-market
profit-takers. "We have been net sellers since it went over
2900," he said. At 2850, he started selling technology,
oil-drilling and environmental-services stocks. At 2900, he
started shedding Dow industrial stocks.
   The rally that took the industrial average above 2900
Friday was sparked by a run-up in bond prices. Rather than
risk the possibility of bonds heading into a severe downturn,
"It's better to take profits now and let the market play
itself out," Mr. Sharma said.
   But without a bond-market retreat, Gene Seagle,
technical-research director at Gruntal &amp; Co., says the
industrial average still could make a run for 3000. If the
extreme bears throw in the towel and the New York Stock
Exchange has a few 200 million share days, "we'll go through
3000 to 3150 before we have an intermediate correction," he
predicted.
   Concern about too much bullishness may be tempering buying
interest, some analysts say. This week's Investors
Intelligence survey of investment advisers shows the bulls
rising to 47.8% of those surveyed from 45.5% last week; bears
fell to 35.4% from 41.1%. The worry is that advisers who call
themselves bulls are in the market, which implies there are
fewer investors on the sidelines waiting to get in.
   The bullish percentage is "still below a level that would
suggest the market is overbought," said Michael Burke, editor
of the survey for Chartcraft Inc., New Rochelle, N.Y. "When
it gets into the 53% to 56% range, that normally signals a
correction."
   Bond prices moved narrowly as investors tried to figure
out how -- or if -- Manuel Johnson's resignation as a Federal
Reserve Board governor might affect Fed policy on interest
rates. Prices then rose on the news that consumer-installment
credit in April rose much less than expected.
   Some analysts say consumers are leery of taking on debt
because they lack confidence in the economy's health. This
additional indication of sluggish economic growth in turn
raises investors' expectations that the Fed will lower
interest rates to stimulate business activity and keep the
economy from tipping into recession.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell on volume of 160.4 million shares, down
from 164 million Wednesday, in Big Board trading. Declining
issues outnumbered advancers, 852 to 638.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.42%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar gained slightly. In late New York trading, the
currency was at 1.6935 marks and 152.55 yen, compared with
1.6885 marks and 152.65 yen Wednesday.

   Atlanta's Braves Try
   Some Weird Pitches,
   But Fans Still Balk

   From Ice Cream to Pickles,
   Team Does Everything
   To Sell Seats Except Win

   ATLANTA -- Earlier this year, when the Atlanta Braves
decided to dispense with a team slogan for the 1990 baseball
season, the local newspaper asked readers what tag they would
attach to the club. Their suggestions?
   "Atlanta Braves -- Still in the Major Leagues]"
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It Just Doesn't Get Any Better Than This -- Ever]"
   Subtle enough? Try one more:
   "Mathematical Elimination Fever -- Catch It]"
   That pretty well sums up 25 years of frustration on the
part of local baseball fans. Since moving to Atlanta in 1966,
the Braves have never won a pennant, never mind a World
Series. The last time they won even a divisional championship
was eight years ago. This year, the team is well on its way
to its seventh straight losing season and is already locked
in a close contest for last place in the National League's
Western Division.
   Not surprisingly, finding a seat at Atlanta-Fulton County
Stadium, the home of the Braves, is rather easy these days.
With only 12,000 people or so passing through the turnstiles
for each game -- the lowest attendance in the majors -- the
average Atlantan has a choice of about 40,000-odd seats for
any home date.
   All of this misery, however, overlooks one poignant point:
Few clubs in the major leagues have tried harder to get fans
out to the park. And yet no one has had worse luck -- or, on
occasion, has proved more inept -- at doing that than the
Braves.
   Simply put, nothing seems to go right. Not the weather
(Opening Day this year wasn't simply rained out, it was
tornadoed out); not the team's promotions (a disk jockey was
once invited to dive into the "world's largest bowl of ice
cream" and had to be hauled out of a vat of chocolate muck
when he almost drowned); and definitely not its choice this
year of a celebrity endorser (Ernest P. Worrell, of "Ernest
Goes to Jail" movie fame, whose rubbery face has been roundly
booed by fans when flashed on the stadium scoreboard).
   Some people say the problem is that team owner Ted Turner
spends more on his cable empire than on what is still being
billed, frightfully, as "America's Team." But Mr. Turner, who
reports losing $7.4 million on the Braves last year along
with 97 games, demurs. "We've tried spending exorbitant
amounts of money and we've tried not spending exorbitantly,"
he says. "If I knew what to do differently, I'd have already
done it."
   Take last October. Please. At the end of the season, the
Braves were so close to the million mark in attendance they
could taste it. Facing the final weekend series, against the
Los Angeles Dodgers, they needed only 19,910 fans to make it.
The team got a big break when Chrysler Corp. bought a block
of 10,000 tickets for Friday night. Saturday was Fan
Appreciation Night, which, with all the giveaways, seemed a
guaranteed 25,000 to 30,000 seats sold. And that left Sunday
as gravy.
   Then, it rained. And rained. Friday and Saturday were
washed out, and on Sunday, the last day of the season, only
4,840 fans showed, leaving the Braves 15,070 short of a
million. "We don't even like to think about it," says Jack
Tyson, director of ticket sales.
   Under fire from all sides, Braves loyalists like to dredge
up the old days, when things were really bad. The latest
issue of the Tomahawk Times, the Braves' booster-club
newsletter, reminds members that in 1935, when the Braves
were in their original home town of Boston, the team went
38-115, finishing 61 1/2 games out of first. And they had
Babe Ruth.
   "We're not really playing bad," contends booster-club
president Wayne Coleman. "It's just that the other team has a
tendency to score at least one more run than we do."
   That tendency makes life particularly tough for the Braves
marketing department. Saddled with a team that is perennially
short on athletic talent, the sales staff over the years has
concocted some of the most bizarre, and sometimes tasteless,
promotions in the annals of baseball.
   In the mid-1970s in particular, after Mr. Turner bought
the team, the ballpark became a virtual circus. Aerialists
walked across wires suspended from the roof of the stadium;
ostriches raced around the outfield; ponies were given away
as door prizes.
   On one memorable evening in 1976, nine couples were
married at home plate and were quickly followed by a
professional wrestling match. It was called "Wedlock and
Headlock Night."
   And those were the good promotions. The team also
sponsored Braves Halter-Top Night, a Farrah Fawcett-Majors
Look-Alike Contest and an on-field wet T-shirt contest. "It
was a disgrace, but you couldn't disgrace our team in those
days," says the Braves' former publicity director, Bob Hope.
   These days, the Braves' promotions seem to lack hope. What
famous personality was on hand to pose for snapshots with
children at a recent game? Slugger Henry Aaron? Pitching
legend Phil Neikro? Nope. It was the Vlasic Pickles Stork.
And it's hard to find anyone with a kind word for what is
generally considered a geeky-looking mascot called "Homer the
Brave," a baseball-uniformed body with an oversized plastic
Indian head topped with a Mohawk.
   Often, the Braves' biggest draw is the other team. At a
recent Cubs-Braves game in Atlanta, the loudest cheers came
from a sea of Cub-blue hats and shirts when Chicago's Andre
Dawson slugged a two-run homer. Hanging from the left-field
wall was a spray-painted sheet that read: "Lost Cubs Fan:
Please Return to Wrigley Field."
   "I don't think the fans are angry with the Atlanta
Braves," says Danny Goodwin, the optimistically named Braves
director of community affairs. Mr. Goodwin is sometimes
introduced as the "Bravest Man in Atlanta" for appearing
before the Rotary Club and other groups to field questions
about the team. "We're an outlet to vent frustrations from
bills, the job, whatever," he says.
   Frustrations with the Braves themselves are currently
being vented in the form of suggestions from local marketing
types on how the team might put some fans in the stands. One
advertising director has suggested a Frequent Suffering Bonus
system, in which Braves fans earn points, redeemable for
prizes, based on the number of innings they endure.
   Another idea is called the Guaranteed Win Plan. Fans who
attend a game that the Braves lose could keep coming back for
free until the team manages to win.
   But to fill stands, winning still is the dominant factor.
In 1982, when the team sailed into the National League
playoffs (only to be swept by St. Louis), 1.8 million fans
poured through the gates. In 1983, a record 2.1 million
showed up to cheer the team into second place, without a
single ostrich appearance.
   At the current rate, the Braves will draw about 960,000.
   Despite all their woes, the Braves have had the most
consistently loyal fan in all of baseball. Before this season
started, Pearl Sandow is said to have shown up for all 1,899
home games the Atlanta Braves had played since relocating
from Milwaukee in 1966. Honoring her achievement, the
Baseball Hall of Fame last summer immortalized her with a
statue in Cooperstown, N.Y.
   In February, the septuagenarian Hall of Famer fell and
broke her shoulders. Now, Ms. Sandow watches the games on
television. When she gets off the disabled list, though,
she'll be back in the spot she had occupied for 24 years:
Section 105, Row 9, Seat 1.
   For her, there is really no other choice. As she explains
it, "Bad baseball is better than no baseball at all."

   Schering's Maybelline Deal With Group
   Collapses, Wasserstein to Buy the Unit

   NEW YORK -- Schering-Plough Corp.'s accord to sell its
Maybelline cosmetics business to MBP Acquisition Corp.
collapsed, but the drug maker entered a new agreement to sell
it to leveraged buy-out specialist Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co.
   The sale price is unchanged at $300 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, Wasserstein Perella announced that it
closed the acquisition of the Yardley/Lentheric cosmetics
lines from SmithKline Beecham PLC for #110 million ($185.6
million).
   Schering and MBP were tight-lipped about the reason their
agreement, announced in April, fell through, but analysts
speculated that financing may have been an issue. MBP
includes Playtex Family Products Corp. of Stamford, Conn.,
the Boston buy-out firm Thomas H. Lee Co., and members of
Playtex and Maybelline management.
   Some insiders expressed surprise at the rapid demise of
the deal with Playtex, which began to unravel last week. But
Wasserstein apparently was poised to step in. An insider
involved in the deal said Wasserstein participated in early
rounds of the bidding and already had done its homework on
Maybelline, the nation's second-largest maker of cosmetics
sold through mass merchandisers.
   Schering, Madison, N.J., put the cosmetics company on the
block in December, saying it wanted to focus on its more
profitable prescription and over-the-counter pharmaceutical
lines.
   Analysts had called $300 million a low price; the figure
about equals Maybelline's 1989 sales. Allan Mottus, a
cosmetics industry consultant, said: "I still think it's a
good company at a good price." For 1990's first quarter,
Schering's cosmetics business, almost all of which is
Maybelline, posted a sales drop of 1.8%, to $59.6 million
from $60.7 million the year earlier.
   Mr. Mottus says Yardley "is a major player in the U.K.
market in makeup and skin care" but "doesn't have a strong
distribution in the U.S.," which can be remedied with
Maybelline's strong presence.
   Robert B. McKeon, co-president of Wasserstein Perella
Management Partners Inc., an arm of the parent, said that
Maybelline has 400 U.S. salespeople and Yardley has 10. In
the U.S., "Yardley has 71% brand-name recognition but only
$15 million" of the brand's $200 million world-wide sales,
Mr. McKeon said.
   In addition, "the {Yardley} name has been dormant since
the late '60s and early '70s. Even if you do {only} a decent
job of bringing the name back, you should be able" to exceed
the $15 million figure here. Mr. McKeon added that in the
U.S., Yardley items currently are sold largely in specialty
shops and Wasserstein will be aiming to place them in the
larger drug chains and retailers as well.
   Mr. McKeon said Wasserstein Perella has put together "a
very conservative capital structure" for Maybelline, using no
junk bonds. The financing involves "substantial" equity,
which he wouldn't specify, and bank debt.
   "Over time, we'll refinance the two companies together in
a holding company," providing a vehicle for acquisitions, he
said. Mr. Mottus, the consultant, suggested that at some
point, Wasserstein Perella might consider making a public
offering in such a cosmetics business.
   The Maybelline transaction is subject to approvals
including antitrust clearance. Wasserstein Perella is
expected to retain the current managers of Maybelline and
Yardley and to offer them equity holdings in the newly
acquired companies.

   Grounding of British Tanker Causes
   Another Major Spill in New York Harbor

   NEW YORK -- In the third major spill this year in New York
Harbor, a British-registered oil tanker ran aground, spilling
about 260,000 gallons of heavy crude oil.
   New York and New Jersey officials reacted angrily, some
calling the spill a consequence of the failure of the Reagan
administration to require tougher safety standards for
tankers, such as double hulls. By late-afternoon, a strike
force of the U.S. Coast Guard that specializes in oil-spill
cleanups arrived from its station in Mobile, Ala.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The single-hull tanker, BT Nautilus, was being guided by
two tugboats when it went aground in the Kill van Kull, a
narrow waterway between New York City's borough of Staten
Island and the marine terminals of New Jersey. The other
spills this year involved ruptured pipelines or leaks at
facilities.
   By noon, tanker Captain Frank Ainscrough and several crew
members had been given urinalysis tests to check whether they
were impaired by alcohol or drugs. Later in the afternoon,
investigators for the New Jersey attorney general arrested
the first mate, Geoffrey Frederick Gregory. He was scheduled
to be arraigned last night on charges of operating a vessel
while under the influence of intoxicants and of discharging a
pollutant without a permit. A criminal inquiry of possible
violations of the state's environmental laws is continuing.
   It wasn't clear what caused the tanker to run aground.
Several officials, along with Judith Yaskin, New Jersey's
commissioner of environmental protection, noted that
navigational charts of the area included a warning of a large
rock in the Kill van Kull. "We don't know if we have a case
for negligence here," she said. "This still has to be
investigated."
   The Coast Guard said the Army Corps of Engineers is
dredging the waterway to make it deeper, but a project to
blast heavy rock formations in the area won't begin until at
least year end.
   Coast Guard Capt. Robert North, who is coordinating the
spill cleanup, said the BT Nautilus was inspected by the
Coast Guard in Philadelphia in August and its
pollution-prevention, navigational and cargo-containment
equipment were found to be in good condition.
   Capt. James Sanial, chief of marine inspection for the
port, added that the 11-year-old ship was cited by the Coast
Guard on only one occasion, in 1986, for not having correct
navigational maps. "That's the only problem we know of," he
said.
   The ship, which is owned by the Nautilus Motor Tanker Co.,
London, a subsidiary of BT Shipping Ltd., of Bermuda, was
carrying 350,000 barrels, or 12.6 million gallons, of No. 6
crude.
   The starboard hold where the rupture occurred, had 1.2
million gallons. By late morning, booms were erected around
the ship and oil was siphoned off up to the 30-foot rupture
point. "There was no more product going into the
environment," said a Coast Guard spokesman. However, the
cleanup of the spill will take at least a month, another
spokesman said.
   The crude is owned by Coastal Corp., Houston, and was
loaded in the west African nation of Cameroon. Coastal plans
to distribute the oil to industrial customers.
   Angry officials from New York and New Jersey appeared
exasperated as they stood at Coastal's shoreline facility in
Bayonne, N.J., near where the BT Nautilus was being pumped.
"The message here is the folly of the Reagan Administration's
policy to abandon the double-bottom ships," said Thomas C.
Jorling, commissioner of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation.
   Ms. Yaskin said "taxpayers won't pay for this cleanup.
We're going to charge the {responsible parties} for cleanup
costs, property damage and any other penalties that exist
under our spill laws."
   "We're getting sick and tired of the repetitive nature of
these spills," said Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.). "Here
we've had 40% of the significant spills {in the country} this
year and the {Coast Guard's} national strike team is based in
Alabama."
   Moments later, when Rear Adm. Richard Rybacki, commander
of the First Coast Guard District, Boston, Mass., walked over
to greet the senator, Mr. Lautenberg asked sarcastically, "So
Admiral, has your ace force arrived yet? We have too much
activity here. We have to have the best facilities possible"
for handling oil spills. The admiral stared at the senator
while an aide said the strike team would arrive in 15
minutes.

   Cable Bill
   Is Cleared

   WASHINGTON -- The Senate Commerce Committee passed a bill
to reregulate cable television after a compromise reached
with the industry unraveled over antitrust and competitive
issues.
   The legislation, which passed 18-1, still faces many
hurdles, including the threat of a full-court press by big
cable operators to kill it. But the cable industry's
withdrawal from the compromise not to oppose the measure
strengthened many lawmakers' resolve to rein in the industry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The legislation sets up a basic tier of cable service that
consists of public-access channels and local broadcast
signals, and it requires cable systems to carry local TV
stations. Rates for the basic service would be regulated by
municipalities when local cable operators don't face
competition from other multichannel providers such as another
cable system, wireless cable service or direct broadcast
satellite service. Guidelines for regulation would be
established by the Federal Communications Commission.
   Under the legislation, the FCC can step in and regulate
rates for satellite service, such as Cable News Network and
ESPN, only if it acts on a complaint of excessive rate
increases. Further, the bill would direct the FCC to set
limits on the number of subscribers for any one cable
company, and to cap the number of channels that can be used
by programmers that are wholly or partly owned by the cable
operators.
   The legislation also says that cable programmers that are
owned wholly or in part by multisystem cable operators can't
"unreasonably refuse" to make programming available to
companies that compete with cable operators. The industry and
the committee parted company over that provision. The
industry wanted language in the bill to make clear that
exclusive programming is a legitimate business strategy. It
also wanted to be able to decline to provide programming to
competitors unless required to do so under current antitrust
laws.
   The National Cable Television Association, which earlier
in the week reached an agreement with key senators that it
wouldn't oppose the bill, reversed course after committee
leaders refused to change the legislative draft. Yesterday,
Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.) placed blame squarely on the
cable industry, accusing it of demanding at the last minute a
"special carve-out" from antitrust law.
   On a voice vote, the committee strengthened the language
stating that cable programmers with financial ties to cable
operators can't "unreasonably refuse" to sell programming to
competitors. It specifically added a reference to direct
broadcast satellite and backyard satellite dishes to the list
of competitors. And in a further slap to the cable industry,
the committee removed its "finding" that exclusivity is a
legitimate business strategy.
   Stephen Effros, president of the Community Antenna
Television Association, said the cable industry will "very
strongly oppose" the legislation. "We're willing to compete,
but these guys want us to give competitors our product," he
said. "The bill's language forcing us to make our products
available to others was murky, and we said: `Look, this has
got to be clear. There is no deal if we cannot protect our
programming.'"
   NCTA President James Mooney was more circumspect. He
called the bill "a considerable improvement" over earlier
proposals, but he added that it "goes too far and we must
oppose it." He said his organization would continue to work
toward "reasonable" legislation in both houses, but that it
"cannot accept legislation that hampers the ability of our
industry to continue to grow and to serve our customers."
   Lawmakers have been under considerable pressure from
constituents, who have complained that monthly bills have
skyrocketed since 1987, when rates were largely deregulated
under the 1984 Cable Act. Many members in both the House and
Senate would like to pass cable legislation before the
November elections. Meantime, the FCC, which would pick up
much of the authority for developing guidelines and enforcing
them, plans to present a package of proposals on the cable
industry and competition this summer.
   In a move that could help the efforts of telephone
companies to enter the cable industry, the committee said it
would hold hearings this summer and vote on a separate bill
sponsored by Sen. Conrad Burns (R., Mont.). The committee,
however, widely viewed the controversial Burns measure as a
"killer amendment" that could torpedo the entire bill.
   Gene Kimmelman, legislative director for the Consumer
Federation of America and a longtime opponent of telephone
company entry into the cable business, said the last-minute
maneuver by the cable industry gives the Burns proposal some
momentum as lawmakers seek strong competitors to cable.
"Cable companies," he said, "have now shown that they deserve
the phone companies as their adversaries."

   FORT WORTH, Texas -- It's getting to be an old joke, but
the head of American Airlines' international services, Hans
Mirka, doesn't so much as chuckle. When his managers
introduce themselves to travel officials in Europe, he says,
the response often is, "Which American airline? You mean Pan
Am?"
   Pan Am and other global carriers may take some solace in
this confusion over a generic-sounding name, but not much.
That's because they know what the travel agents don't yet.
American, the undisputed king of deregulated U.S. skies, is
going global. And that is no laughing matter for the
competition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They're an aggressive and expansionist airline," says
British Airways spokesman David Burnside. "We admire them."
   With domestic growth slowing, American is under pressure
to broaden its international business to maintain its recent
double-digit gains in passengers and revenue. Other former
stay-at-home U.S. carriers -- Delta, America West and USAir,
among them -- are seeking a stronger presence abroad for the
same reason. But only American has its sights set on three
continents at once.
   The deep-pocketed carrier picked up Eastern Airlines'
routes to South America for $310 million earlier this year.
It has moved most aggressively into Europe, anticipating a
surge in traffic when trade barriers come down in 1992.
Several months ago, American agreed to buy Trans World
Airlines' Chicago-London business for $195 million; American
hopes to secure federal approval to fly the route sometime
this summer. American is also seeking other European routes.
   To supplement its single flight to Tokyo, American is
competing against nine other U.S. carriers for six important
new passenger routes to Japan, a market expanding five times
as fast as the domestic one. The public counsel for the U.S.
Department of Transportation is expected to issue a
preliminary recommendation on the matter today.
   American is in a strong position to maintain an
international network. With 200,000 passengers a day, it has
"the biggest, most mature domestic market in the world," Mr.
Burnside of British Airways notes. That gives American
considerable "feeder traffic" to funnel onto overseas
flights.
   American's drive to become an international powerhouse
traces back to 1982, but the pace is accelerating. The
airline is adding so many destinations so fast that some
believe it could overtake the likes of Pan Am and TWA,
international carriers for half a century, within several
years. In Europe, however, Pan Am now serves 41 European
cities, TWA 24 and American 11.
   Why not simply buy Pan Am or TWA? "We've always said we
don't want to buy another airline," says Robert L. Crandall,
chairman of American and its parent, AMR Corp. "We don't want
to acquire another airline's airplanes. We don't want another
airline's people. We are only buying the right to fly."
American wants to avoid the labor hassles of integrating
union workers. And it disdains buying used planes, preferring
to maintain a uniform fleet of airliners built to its
specifications to keep down training and maintenance costs.
   But American admits that its foreign offensive has been
bumpy and fraught with missteps. Take its headlong rush last
year into Stuttgart, Hamburg and Geneva, with flights from
the U.S. that passed through Brussels. Expensive landing fees
and thin traffic on the last leg made the one-stop routes too
costly and they had to be abandoned. American's route
planners adopted a new rule as a result: nonstops or nothing.
   Meanwhile, some of its hard-won international routes are
being flown infrequently or not at all because American
doesn't own enough long-haul aircraft. It has only two Boeing
747s, for instance. Even $20 billion in planes ordered in the
past five years will provide limited relief when they roll
in, because the order doesn't include enough widebodies. "To
put the plainest face on it," says Mr. Crandall, "we guessed
wrong."
   This hasn't stopped American from aggressively seeking
international passengers. Its newspaper and magazine ads seem
ubiquitous on both sides of the Atlantic. In European ads,
they always picture an American Airlines jet so readers know
the ad refers to a specific airline.
   American's high profile seems to rile Delta. Although
Delta declined to comment for this article, it took a potshot
in a recent employee publication. "While Delta has moved with
less publicity," the statement read in part, "we believe our
expansion has been more orderly and sure-footed." Delta has
fewer routes to Europe, but more to Asia.
   American has pulled out all the stops in its efforts to
woo European travel agents and corporate travel managers, who
hold greater sway over customers' travel decisions than their
U.S. counterparts. American has been offering the agents free
first-class trips, hoping its luxurious service will win them
over "company by company, individual by individual," says
Michael Gunn, American's head of marketing.
   The carrier spares no expense on its first-class service.
Passengers nestle into supple, sheepskin and leather seats
that cost $24,000 a pair. The smell of bread and
chocolate-chip cookies being baked inflight wafts through the
cabin. Lobster fajitas are served on china with a vase of
fresh flowers alongside. And should a traveler tire of the
movie he has slipped into his personal video cassette player,
he can recline his seat nearly horizontal to doze under
oversized blankets.
   American intends its service to rival that of heavyweights
such as Swissair, Lufthansa and Cathay Pacific. "We don't
want to hear that Swissair does better than we do," declares
Donald Carty, American's executive vice president of
planning. "And we certainly don't want to hear that British
Airways does better than we do."
   But the carrier's marketing efforts will be wasted if it
doesn't rectify its seat shortage, and soon. Acquisitions of
foreign routes have outstripped aircraft deliveries, forcing
American to accelerate its "musical planes" game. It bailed
out of service to Lyon and Frankfurt this spring and
postponed flights to Helsinki, Warsaw and Barcelona -- set to
start this month -- to free up enough jets to fly
Chicago-London twice a day and the longest South American
routes.
   Such maneuvers may not bode well for the carrier's hopes
for added route awards from the Transportation Department.
The agency prefers to award routes to carriers that promise
to make the most seats available, and it has appeared partial
to fleets with lots of 747s. American doesn't much like 747s,
preferring the more cost-efficient 200-seat Boeing 767. In
any case, it would have to wait at least three years for new
747s because of Boeing's large backlog.
   Big planes are especially important if American is to
increase service to Japan and hopes to snare one of the new
Soviet routes recently authorized. So, admittedly
halfheartedly, "we're out rustling around looking for 747s,"
says American's operations chief, Robert Baker.
   The plane American plans to use most in its international
expansion, along with the 767, is the MD-11, a new, extremely
economical plane from McDonnell Douglas. American has ordered
15 of the jets, whose flying range matches that of the 747,
but which seat only about 250. The first MD-11s, originally
due at American in the fall of 1990, are now expected in
early 1991, but American executives fear the manufacturer
could fall further behind.
   American's jet shortfall could worsen considerably over
the next couple of years if other carriers put desirable
routes on the block that it feels compelled to snap up.
Continuing financial difficulties at Pan Am and TWA make that
a strong possibility.
   Critics charge that American uses the excuse of too few
planes to extricate itself from embarrassing, money-losing
routes. In fact, American is open about its practice of
abandoning a route that isn't profitable reasonably soon. "We
either succeed, and succeed fairly fast," says Wesley
Kaldahl, an American consultant who once ran the
international operations, "or we say the hell with it. There
are better things to do with our airplanes."
   In 1983, American pulled out of Rio de Janeiro after nine
months of losses. It ended its New York-Lyon run last week
after the route failed to turn a profit.
   Experimental routes such as Rio or Lyon do pay off in
other ways, though. By flying untried routes, American has
gained valuable international operating experience and
bolstered its image as an international carrier in the minds
of passengers, travel agents and government officials. "They
positioned themselves to take advantage of route
opportunities that came up later," says William H. Pacelli, a
manager at Avmark Inc., a consulting firm.
   In going global, American has been barred from using some
of its most successful domestic sales tools. Because of tight
regulations in some European countries, it has had to forgo
using its AAdvantage frequent-flier program. Nor can American
engage in the kind of quick fare changes abroad that are
common at home; fare changes overseas are subject to
government reviews that can take weeks.
   And, even though American is spending big money to bolster
its international staff and improve ground service in the
U.S., it can't affect ground service much in certain European
countries that rotate airport workers among carriers.
   American has seized on some new sales tactics, however. It
recently allied itself with the French rail service after
discovering that passengers to Paris often took trains to
their next destination. Combined ticketing for plane and
train will be a boon for American when it takes affect later
this year.
   While waiting to be discovered by Europeans -- and by
Americans bound for Europe -- American certainly isn't about
to fly at less than capacity. If it isn't packing in the
passengers, it'll pack in the cargo. "If you put 3,000 pounds
of cargo on a passenger flight, that's like having 92 more
passengers," said William Boesch, who heads American's cargo
division. Last year, American's European passenger "load
factor" hovered at a respectable 65.5%, while its cargo load
factor regularly broke an enviable 80%.
   Cargo doesn't have the cachet that passenger service does.
But American seems to accept that becoming an international
powerhouse may take time. "We haven't been, and are not going
to be, an overnight sensation," sighs Mr. Mirka.

   Hedging Risk With `Global Switch' Fund

MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)

   NEW YORK -- U.S. high-tech money managers are applying
their skills to global investing.
   One recent entrant -- the Celebration Fund -- uses a
computerized investing strategy to shuffle money between U.S.
and Japanese stock markets, moving into whichever one is
stronger.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The fund, begun Oct. 31, has already drawn $700 million
from Japanese institutional investors. And the fund enabled
them to dodge the Tokyo stock market's plunge earlier this
year with a well-timed switch out of Japanese stocks.
   The fund uses a mathematical model developed by Leland
O'Brien Rubenstein Associates Inc., a Los Angeles high-tech
money manager that won notoriety in the U.S. for inventing
portfolio insurance. Portfolio insurance uses stock-index
futures to guard an investor's portfolio against a stock
market decline; the strategy was widely popular until the
1987 market crash, when the method didn't work as forecast
and even helped accelerate the plunge in stocks.
   It's no accident that the new fund is aimed exclusively at
big Japanese investors. With plenty of cash, but little
black-box investing technology of their own, the Japanese
have been eager to tap U.S. computerized investing skills.
These include tactical asset allocation (switching between
stocks, bonds and cash), stock-sector selection, and
computer-driven program trading of stock and stock-index
futures.
   The Celebration Fund is managed by Wells Fargo Nikko,
jointly owned by Japan's Nikko Securities Co. and Wells Fargo
&amp; Co., the big San Francisco bank. Last year, Nikko paid $125
million for a 50% stake in Wells Fargo Investment Advisors,
one of the two largest U.S. computer-based money managers,
with $80 billion under management.
   First Quadrant Corp. this week announced joint ventures
with Japanese and French financial institutions to do global
asset allocation. Earlier this spring, Templeton
International, a longtime global stock manager headed by Sir
John Templeton, acquired a small quantitatively oriented firm
to supplement its traditional stock-picking.
   The latest Leland O'Brien strategy involves selling stocks
in whichever market is weaker, the U.S. or Tokyo, and moving
money into the stronger market until the trend reverses. That
can involve rapid trading. From November to January, the
Celebration Fund swung its $700 million out of Japanese
stocks entirely, and into the U.S. market. That allowed the
Japanese investors to sidestep most of the Tokyo market's
plunge. Unlike portfolio insurance, which uses stock-index
futures, the Celebration Fund trades in actual stocks.
   At the end of each year, Leland O'Brien says, investors
should end up with much of the profits from the
better-performing market.
   If more money flows into this strategy, it could
ultimately produce trading stampedes that would make global
market swings more severe. That's unlikely to happen, though,
unless $10 billion or more is committed to the strategy,
asserts Jeffrey Skelton, a vice chairman of Wells Fargo Nikko
Investment Advisors.
   So far, the Celebration Fund has performed well. For its
first seven months ended May 31, the fund's value rose 7.5%
in yen terms. That's far ahead of a 9.4% drop in the value of
the Tokyo stock market, and part of the way toward the 16.2%
gain in the U.S. market. By comparison, a fund invested half
in U.S. stocks and half in Japanese stocks would have been up
about 3.5%.
   Exactly how well Leland O'Brien's strategy works is still
open to debate. The past eight months' conditions -- with the
plunge in the Tokyo market and the U.S. market's surge --
have been just about ideal for the strategy. It hasn't yet
been tested under the most difficult conditions -- a
trendless, choppy market in both countries.
   Leland O'Brien's strategy of jumping into the
better-performing market could leave the fund whipsawed if
market trends constantly reverse.
   Leland O'Brien executives say their strategy should
capture 90% of the "absolute relative return" of the better
performing market. That's a complex yardstick, though, that
few other people use. By normal measuring standards, the
Leland O'Brien strategy so far seems to deliver 60% to 70% of
the gain of the better performing market if the two markets
diverge sharply, or a few percentage points behind the
average of the two markets if their performances are nearly
identical.
   A Nikko spokesman says Japanese investors are likely to be
offered a Celebration II fund and Celebration III soon. In
the U.S., Wells Fargo Nikko says some American clients appear
interested in a similar strategy. For its part, Leland
O'Brien hopes to apply its computer model to European stock
markets, too.

   Piper Jaffray Sees Slightly Higher Profit
   For Year, Citing Small-Investor Activity

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)

<LP>
   Despite declining revenue from bond funds, Piper Jaffray
Inc. expects small investors' increasing enthusiasm for
stocks to slightly boost its earnings for the fiscal year
ending Sept. 30, Charles Hayssen, chief financial officer,
said.
   "The days are over for {bond} funds. People have had
enough of them," Mr. Hayssen said in an interview. Yields
have fallen on many such funds since the October 1987 stock
market crash. Revenue from a new bond fund helped boost net
income of Piper's regional brokerage concern, Piper, Jaffray
&amp; Hopwood Inc., last year to $11.7 million, or $2.92 a share,
on revenue of $195.2 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Piper, based in Minneapolis, is typical of regional
brokers who specialize in analyzing industries in their area
for individual investors. Piper's expertise is largely in
food, agricultural and medical technology concerns.
   The financial performance of such regional firms is viewed
by some analysts as a gauge of small investors' interest in
the market. Regional brokers generally haven't been hit as
hard by cutbacks on Wall Street as have their national
full-service counterparts, some of whose revenue from
investment banking is off by 20% or more.
   At Piper, brokers' commissions on sales of mutual funds
over the past seven months are running 50% ahead of the like
period in the previous fiscal year, according to Mr. Hayssen.
Commissions on listed stocks rose 20% in the same period, he
said, which indicates to him that "the small investor is
showing some courage."
   The turnover rate in the ranks of Piper brokers is about
10% this year, compared with 18% a year ago. The industrywide
broker turnover rate a year ago was about 20%. Piper
currently has about 750 retail brokers, compared with 675
just before the 1987 market crash.
   Piper has helped its earnings in the past two fiscal years
by starting bond funds in its fourth quarter that sold well.
Last year, 35% of Piper's earnings came on sales of such a
fund. "That isn't likely this year," Mr. Hayssen said.
   But, he insisted: "Small investors are listening to
brokers' stories about stocks again. They're starting to get
interested. The fear from the crash of October 1987 is
disappearing."
   He declined to forecast net for the fiscal third quarter,
ending June 30. But he said revenue in the first two months
of the quarter was 15% higher than a year earlier. In last
year's third quarter, Piper had net of $3.3 million, or 83
cents a share, on revenue of $53 million.
   Mr. Hayssen said it's too early to make a specific
forecast for full-year earnings, although analysts expect
them to be flat. He disclosed that planned initial offerings
and additional offerings of stock by certain of Piper's
Midwestern clients could cause earnings in the fourth quarter
to surge from last year's $4.1 million, or $1.03 a share, on
revenue of $57.4 million. But he said such offerings might
also be delayed until the next fiscal year.
   For that reason, a specific forecast isn't possible, and
earnings for the year "may be about the same, plus or minus a
little," he said.

   Recycling White Paper
   Into Money in the Bank

   WHEN Matthew Costello looks at Boston's skyline, he sees
mountains of paper that could be recycled.
   Mr. Costello is one of a growing number of entrepreneurs
whose niche is helping companies set up in-house recycling
programs. His firm, Corporate Conservation, Cambridge, Mass.,
specializes in scrap white paper. Despite some recent
softening of the market for white paper, demand remains
strong, unlike the market for newspaper.
   Mr. Costello says setup costs for a program to recycle
white paper, which fetches $60 to $100 a ton, can be repaid
in a few months by sales. That's not to mention reduced
waste-disposal costs, he adds.
   For a fee, he arranges to install recycling bins, dickers
with paper buyers, educates employees on what to recycle and
checks their trash to make sure it has the right stuff. "We
didn't have the kind of knowledge and resources" to do all
that, says a spokeswoman for Beacon Cos., a commercial real
estate developer that's one of Mr. Costello's Boston
customers.
   Corporate recycling of newspapers, glass, plastic and
other things isn't necessarily profitable. But many companies
are setting up broad recycling programs regardless of profits
because of environmental concerns and new laws encouraging
trash reduction, says Steve Faust, a Montpelier, Vt.,
recycling consultant.
   Furthermore, says Jacqueline Neurauter, co-founder of
Ecologize for Profit, a recycling consultant in Arlington
Heights, Ill., "a lot of businesses are getting pressure from
their own employees" to recycle. And many programs are
started by "people who handle trash at companies and are
appalled" by what's thrown away, says Jeffrey Coyne of
Earthworm Inc., a nonprofit recycling consultant and paper
hauler in Boston.
                                                                                                       

   Beach Sweep Turns Up
   Everything, Even Sinks
                                                                                                       

   ITEMS COLLECTED in a national beach cleanup included a
wedding contract, Easter eggs, 605 hard hats and 1,895,502
plastic pieces.
   In various one-day cleanups held last fall, more than
65,000 volunteers in 25 states and territories collected 860
tons of debris, says the Center for Marine Conservation in
Washington, D.C., sponsor of the affair. Volunteers recorded
what they found, providing a unique audit of Americans' dirty
work down by the sea.
   Plastic accounted for 63% of the litter, with
Stryrofoam-style plastic foam winning the distinction as the
most abundant form. The conservation group singled out
cigarette filters, classified as plastic, as the most
frustrating item. Volunteers stooped to scoop up 164,141
butts.
   Beaches in Oregon and other states requiring bottle
deposits generally had fewer bottles than those in other
states. Syringes were most prevalent in Texas, but Delaware
and New York weren't far behind. New Jersey and Massachusetts
had the most sewage-associated trash, largely tampon
applicators, a sign of overflowing sewer systems. Louisiana
had the most garbage from ships' galleys, which included
plastic milk and water jugs and a carton of intact eggs
encrusted with barnacles.
   Dozens of trash-trapped animals were found, ranging from
mice caught in bottles to herons tangled in fishing lines.
Volunteers found 18,251 balloons, which turtles and other
animals are known to eat with fatal results.

   Toxic-Waste Collector,
   At Residents' Disposal
                                                                                                       

   SEATTLE is making it easier for residents to get rid of
hazardous substances with a traveling "Wastemobile."
   Household hazardous wastes account for only about 1% of
U.S. trash by weight. But concerns are mounting about those
wastes -- such as paint, pesticides, used motor oil and
batteries -- because older landfills weren't built with
liners to keep liquid toxins out of ground water. Many
households dump the stuff down the drain, fouling water
treatment plants and poisoning waterways, or throw it in the
garbage, exposing trash handlers and landfill personnel to
toxins.
   Many towns hold annual collection days for the wastes. But
a study of collection drives in two cities showed that they
actually increase the amount of hazardous waste tossed in the
trash, says William Rathje, a University of Arizona garbage
researcher. "The publicity for the collection days makes
people realize" that they possess hazardous materials, he
explains. "They don't want it around the house, so they throw
it out," instead of bothering to tote it to a collection
point on the designated day.
   Seattle's Wastemobile is a truck and trailer that stops
for two weeks at a time in various places throughout King
County. Its movements are planned to bring it within 15
minutes of every home every six months, says Henry Draper,
program director. During its first six months of operation,
the Wastemobile collected 60% more hazardous material than
expected. But it isn't cheap. The program will cost King
County $1.5 million for the first 27 months.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends

   Chicago Merc Pays
   $100,000 Penalty
   To Settle Charges

COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (CFT)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, in the
second-largest settlement ever accepted by a commodity
exchange, agreed to pay a $100,000 civil penalty for
allegedly failing to report violations by four futures firms.
   The settlement reached with the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission concludes a 13-count administrative complaint
filed by the agency in January 1987.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The penalty comes at a time when the agency would benefit
from appearing to be a strong regulator. The Bush
administration is proposing to wrest oversight of stock-index
futures away from the CFTC and grant the power to the
Securities and Exchange Commission. That shift is vehemently
opposed by the commodity regulator, which is backed in the
fight by the commodity exchanges.
   The CFTC said the Merc violated rules requiring exchanges
to tell the agency if a member firm fails to provide
CFTC-required reports. When the four firms didn't comply, the
Merc didn't disclose that, the agency said.
   A spokesman for the exchange said the complaint resulted
from a disagreement over interpretation of CFTC regulations.
   "I think there was honest disagreement over what should or
shouldn't have been reported," Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma
said. "You can't always know exactly what somebody wants, and
our interpretation of what to provide was different than
theirs."
   "The whole purpose of the case," said CFTC enforcement
director Dennis Klejna, "is to drive home the point that the
exchanges have an obligation to inform the commission when
they learn of the inadequacies and we haven't been informed."
   It isn't unusual for the agency to charge exchanges with
failing to follow their own rules, as in this case, he said.
But, "This is the first time we've brought an action against
an exchange for failing to provide notice to the commission"
of firms' deficiencies, Mr. Klejna said.
   The four firms -- CRT Services Inc., Chicago Grain &amp;
Financial Futures Co., Rouse Woodstock Inc. and
ContiCommodity Services Inc. -- failed to make reports
relating to early warning net capital levels, which tell the
agency that the firm might be headed for trouble; major
inadequacies in internal controls; and non-current books and
records, the CFTC said. Financial audits of the firms from
September 1982 to March 1984 showed the problems, the agency
said.
   A CRT Services official said the problem resulted from an
error in a computer program used by the firm that was
immediately corrected. The three other firms have gone out of
business or have been acquired by other commodity-trading
firms since the alleged violations occurred.
   Although no charges have been filed against the firms for
similar reporting violations, both Rouse and ContiCommodity
in recent years have settled CFTC charges of fraud and other
violations, the agency said.
   The Merc, which settled the complaint without admitting or
denying guilt, also agreed to let the CFTC more closely
monitor the exchange's enforcement of its financial
compliance program for two years.
   The Merc's agreement was second in size to the $200,000
settlement by the New York Mercantile Exchange in the early
1980s for problems stemming from the 400-ounce gold contract.
The case resulted in the delisting of the contract.

   FIRST FIDELITY BANCORP. (Lawrenceville, N.J.) -- Standard
&amp; Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on about $750 million of
debt, citing the regional banking concern's recent
announcement of an expected increase of as much as 40% in
nonperforming assets. S&amp;P lowered its subordinated debt
rating on the company, which operates in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania, to double-B-plus from triple-B, and its rating
on preferred stock to double-B from triple-B-minus. Other
ratings were also lowered, S&amp;P said. The rating concern put
the company on its CreditWatch list for a possible lower
rating in May after First Fidelity said second-quarter loan
losses could be as much as $300 million and announced a
dividend cut. S&amp;P said the increase in problem loans could
marginally exceed the company's estimates. "While the
downside risk is limited, given the company's relatively
moderate exposure to commercial real estate and highly
leveraged transactions," S&amp;P said, "First Fidelity's poor
financial performance over the past several months has
weakened its ability to handle new problems." It said that
although the company has bolstered credit policies and sought
to deal with its costs, "a weak operating environment will
delay the financial benefits from these changes."

   MOSCOW -- In the fall of 1985, two Soviet hackers sat down
at a computer and devised an infuriatingly simple game that
has taken the world by storm. Now a standard feature on
Nintendo, the popular home video system, Tetris is one of the
hottest software games ever to hit the market. Four million
copies have been sold in the U.S. alone so far.
   But Alexei Pazhitnov and Vadim Gerasimov, the game's
inventors, are only half celebrating. Although Tetris has won
them international fame, the two hackers haven't received a
penny of the profits the game has generated -- and it isn't
likely they ever will. Mr. Gerasimov, a 21-year-old student,
can't even afford a computer of his own. "I don't worry about
money very much," the thin, shy hacker says modestly, "but I
hope that this mistake will be corrected."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev battles to overhaul his
nation's economy, he is counting on the talents of people
such as Mr. Pazhitnov and Mr. Gerasimov. Mr. Gorbachev
insists the U.S.S.R. has more to sell than just raw materials
like oil and minerals, and he frequently talks about the
nation's "huge scientific potential." Soviet officials hail
the success of Tetris as proof.
   But Tetris seems as much a testament to the chronic
shortcomings of the Soviet economic system as an
advertisement for Soviet science. Tetris's path from computer
lab to international stardom was littered with obstacles. Its
discovery owes more to chance than design. And clumsy Soviet
efforts to market the game sparked acrimonious copyright
lawsuits in the U.S., giving the Soviets an unprecedented
taste of American jurisprudence.
   "Tetris has made history," says Nikolai E. Belikov, the
Soviet trade specialist responsible for licensing the game.
But he also concedes that the Soviet inexperience in trade
hurt efforts to capitalize on Tetris. "This was our first
contract with computer games and it was necessary to
understand the market. We needed time," he says, adding that
"we have learned very much" from the experience.
   Tetris is the brainchild of Mr. Pazhitnov, 35, a bearded
expert in applied mathematics who works at the prestigious
Soviet Academy of Sciences Computing Center, which studies,
among other things, artificial intelligence. Like hackers the
world over, he is often drawn to computer play. His passion
happens to be puzzles.
   While noodling around on his machine, Mr. Pazhitnov came
up with a kind of computerized Rubik's Cube. In his version,
a player races the clock to create orderly blocks out of
squares, rectangles and other shapes that drop from the top
of a computer screen.
   The Computing Center's clunky Soviet machines weren't
equipped to handle graphics, so the first version of the game
was fairly primitive. When the center purchased more
sophisticated personal computers from IBM in 1985, Mr.
Pazhitnov set about adapting his game to them. He got some
help from Mr. Gerasimov, then a 17-year-old math whiz who
frequently dropped by the center after school.
   Fine-tuning Tetris became an obsession. "All the chiefs
began to hate me because they wanted serious work," Mr.
Pazhitnov recalls. But the two persisted, and over a period
of months they came up with a game that was simple, elegant
and, according to its many fans, addictive.
   Tetris was an instant hit among Soviet computer buffs, who
copied it and passed it from hand to hand. "Within a couple
of weeks, I found it in every corner of Moscow," Mr.
Pazhitnov says.
   For all their work, Mr. Pazhitnov and Mr. Gerasimov had
only token rights to their invention and couldn't stop it
from being pirated in the U.S.S.R., which doesn't have any
effective copyright laws. The pair handed over the rights to
Tetris to the Computing Center, which, as a state
institution, is allowed to own inventions. The two knew it
was the only chance they had to get the game on the market.
   Soviet officials concede they probably wouldn't have done
anything with the game had they not received a telegram in
late 1987 from Robert Stein, a Hungarian refugee who runs a
British company called Andromeda Software, seeking to acquire
the rights to Tetris. Mr. Stein had spotted the game in 1986
while on a visit to Budapest. "I sat down and played it," Mr.
Stein says. "I'm not a games player, and I knew that if I
liked it, it must be a success."
   Mr. Stein copied the game and took it back to London,
where he sold the rights for an undisclosed amount to a
British company called Mirrorsoft, a software unit of Maxwell
Communication Corp., the media conglomerate. Mr. Stein
concedes he sold rights that weren't legally his, but he says
he thought he would eventually be able to acquire the rights
from the Soviets.
   Mirrorsoft launched the game in Britain and Western Europe
in January 1988, and, a few months later, in the U.S.
Mirrorsoft subsequently sublicensed the U.S. home-video
rights to Tengen Inc., a software unit of video-game
manufacturer Atari Games Corp. of Milpitas, Calif.
   Apparently concerned about his company's claim to Tetris
-- and its right to license it to Mirrorsoft -- Mr. Stein
went to Moscow in early 1988 to secure a license from Elorg,
a Soviet state trading agency that acted on behalf of the
Computing Center. Elorg gave Mr. Stein's company, Andromeda,
a license to sell the personal-computer version of the game.
   Elorg officials say they discovered only by chance that
Tetris was a big hit on the home-video market in the U.S. and
elsewhere; they found out by reading computer trade
magazines. Officials, who say they thought they had licensed
only the personal computer version, not the home video
version, to Mr. Stein, were shocked. They complained to him,
but didn't take any action to halt sales.
   Elorg also claims Mr. Stein deliberately dragged his feet
in paying them licensing fees, although the agency won't say
how much it believes it is owed. Mr. Stein acknowledges some
delays in paying the Soviets, but he says his customers were
slow to pay him.
   Meanwhile, another problem loomed. Rigid Soviet accounting
rules make it almost impossible to reward people who think up
marketable ideas. The Computing Center has earned hundreds of
thousands of dollars so far from Tetris, but the money goes
into a special fund that can be used only to buy new
equipment. "It's part of our general stupidity in this
country," says Vladimir Mazurik, a senior official at the
center. "It's important to reward people who work hard."
   Mr. Pazhitnov says he never expected to make a fortune off
Tetris. He recalls telling his bosses at the Computing
Center: "If you can pay me, please do. If you can't, it
doesn't matter." Recently, he got a small bonus of 5,000
rubles. That's about $8,000 at the official exchange rate
but, at the more realistic tourist rate, only $800.
   The Computing Center also hopes to give IBM computers to
Mr. Pazhitnov and Mr. Gerasimov. But "we can't without
special agreement of the presidium of the Academy of
Sciences," shrugs Yuri Yevtushenko, the center's director.
"We are not a private organization, we are a state
institute."
   Evidently embarrassed by the situation, he says: "It's a
new problem for the Soviet Union. We never even considered it
before."
   In any case, by early 1989, international interest in
Tetris was soaring. Japanese, American, and British firms
rushed to Moscow to vie for various rights to the game. Over
several hectic days in February 1989, Elorg conducted
parallel negotiations with Mr. Stein, who was trying to
acquire the license for coin-operated arcade games, and Kevin
Maxwell, Mirrorsoft's chairman and the son of British media
tycoon Robert Maxwell, who thought he already held many of
the licenses via Mr. Stein but came to Moscow to get more.
   Nintendo of America, the U.S. unit of Nintendo Co. of
Kyoto, Japan, the video-game giant, also entered the fray --
and ultimately walked off with one of the most valuable
rights: an exclusive world-wide licensing agreement to use
the game in its entertainment systems. (Mr. Stein got the
arcade-game rights.)
   Mirrorsoft's Mr. Maxwell was furious; he had hoped to
receive all rights to the game. So apparently was his father,
Robert Maxwell, chairman and chief executive of Maxwell
Communication, whose publishing firm brought out the English
version of Mr. Gorbachev's book "Perestroika." Mr. Belikov
says the senior Mr. Maxwell fired off an angry letter to the
Soviet government complaining about Elorg's negotiations with
other companies. A spokesman for the senior Mr. Maxwell
declines to comment on the matter.
   Were it not for the tolerance of senior officials, who
shrugged off the complaint, Mr. Belikov is convinced his
career would have been ruined. "Thank heavens for
perestroika," he beams.
   When Nintendo of America, based in Redmond, Wash.,
returned to the U.S. in April, it was promptly sued for
copyright infringement in federal court by Atari's Tengen,
which thought it had acquired the video-game rights through
Mirrorsoft. Nintendo filed a countersuit, also claiming its
rights had been infringed upon. At issue was the question of
whether Mr. Stein, the British businessman, had acquired the
home-video rights along with the personal-computer rights in
1988.
   After an initial hearing in San Francisco in June, lawyers
from both sides arranged a deposition in Moscow, believed to
be the first such proceeding in the Soviet Union. For several
hours, Mr. Pazhitnov and an Elorg official faced a barrage of
questions in Moscow.
   Meanwhile, an American lawyer for Tengen tracked Mr.
Belikov down in Singapore, where he was on state business.
The Soviet trade specialist wouldn't cooperate. Nintendo's
lawyers had more luck. They persuaded Mr. Belikov to divulge
many of the details of the commercial contracts with Mr.
Stein. For the Soviet Union, long a closed and extremely
secretive society, this was a major step into unknown
territory. Mr. Belikov gave crucial details of the business
transactions to the lawyers. Later, he went to the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow on six separate occasions to swear that his
comments were true.
   "It was the first time a Soviet trade organization had to
swear an oath," says Mr. Belikov. "This is very unusual for
us."
   The final test of Soviet willingness to cooperate in the
dispute came in November, when the case went to court in San
Francisco. Mr. Belikov agreed to go and give evidence --
"very apprehensively," says a lawyer for Nintendo. Because of
extreme difficulties in getting a passport and U.S. visa, he
just made it in the nick of time. But as it turned out, the
judge issued a summary judgment against Tengen, and no
evidence was heard. Tengen's lawyers say the company will
appeal.
   Elorg apparently decided it could play hardball too. A few
days before the hearing in San Francisco, the Soviet trading
agency employed a U.S. accounting firm to audit Mr. Stein's
books to determine exactly how much revenue the game had
generated. The audit results weren't available.
   Back in London, Mr. Stein is indignant. "Everybody hates
me, and everyone is making a fortune out of Tetris," he says,
though he declines to say how much he made off the game
himself. "The Soviets didn't know they had this product. We
told them they had a hot product. We made it famous."
   Mr. Belikov concurs. "It's quite true what he says. We are
grateful to Mr. Stein because he did much to introduce the
game," he says with a smile. "If he had just paid us
adequately, he would have gained a million times more than he
has earned now."

   WELLINGTON -- When New Zealand's economic fortunes are
waning, many move to neighboring Australia, where a bigger
market usually offers a better chance of prosperity.
   Lately, though, the many are moving back to New Zealand.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's the big-city lights" that lure the restless across
the Tasman Sea to Australia, says David Caygill, New
Zealand's finance minister. "So there's a flow all the time
across, but now as many are returning as leaving, and that
certainly wasn't true a year ago."
   To what does he attribute the trend? "Our economy is
picking up and the Australian one is doing the opposite," Mr.
Caygill says.
   By several economic barometers, New Zealand's economy is
staging a recovery, albeit a fragile one. The latest figures
show that the economy is gradually expanding, inflation is
falling and unemployment is easing. Moreover, a wide-ranging
economic overhaul has made the country more competitive, with
productivity up and the stage set for export growth.
   Still, Mr. Caygill says: "The weird thing is the mood is
pessimistic."
   It is indeed. Businesses are balking at investing; they
say the government has backtracked on reshaping the economy.
Disillusioned voters are signaling that they have had enough
of the Labor Party rule that, they say, has turned the nation
of three million people on its ear since taking power in
mid-1984.
   From one of the world's most protected economies, New
Zealand has aspired to become a bastion of free-market,
supply-side economics. The six-year transformation has
saddled the country with relatively high real interest rates,
put a historically large number of people out of work, and
left shell-shocked New Zealanders worried that there will be
little gain for their pain.
   The government must hold an election by October, and
political commentators already are calling on the Labor Party
to put itself and the populace out of their misery by holding
the election sooner. Recent opinion polls predict a landslide
for the main opposition group, the conservative National
Party.
   "We seem to be down in the dumps," observes Lindsay Pyne,
who heads government-controlled Bank of New Zealand.
Downtrodden New Zealanders, he says, "need to believe in
themselves again" to propel the economy.
   Without that all-important confidence, the nascent
economic recovery may fizzle, economists, bankers and others
say. According to a May survey by National Bank of New
Zealand Ltd., business confidence was at its lowest level in
18 months. Farmers were generally the most pessimistic about
the country's economic prospects, followed by manufacturers
and retailers.
   Economic growth "has to be underpinned by business
investment," says Girol Karacaoglu, National Bank of New
Zealand's chief economist. The outlook, he and others say, is
for a sluggish economy. Many private economists expect the
economy to expand by a weak 1% to 2% in the next year or so.
   Based on the latest official figures, the economy grew
less than 1% in 1989, in contrast to a slight contraction in
1988. For the fiscal year ending June 30, the government is
estimating growth of about 1.5%. It hopes to attain a rate of
between 2.5% and 3% next year.
   "We should aim for 3% growth a year as a medium-term
objective, and I'd like to shoot for higher," says Finance
Minister Caygill. He says New Zealand needs to grow between
5% and 6% annually to boost its standard of living, which has
plunged well below that of many industrialized countries
after having been at the top of the list in the 1950s.
   Since coming to power, the Labor government has floated
the New Zealand dollar and deregulated various areas of the
economy, including the financial system, airlines and the oil
industry. It cut tariffs and all but abolished import quotas,
took away industry subsidies, lowered corporate and personal
tax rates and "corporatized" many government-owned companies
by making them operate more like private-sector businesses.
   It also sold hundreds of millions of dollars of government
assets, including the national flag carrier, Air New Zealand,
the country's steel company, its oil-exploration concern, the
state insurance company and nearly half the government's
stake in Bank of New Zealand. It has put the national
telephone company on the auction block and plans to sell
rights to cut timber in government-owned forests.
   Still to come is a further deregulation of the labor
market, a restructuring of the railways, an overhaul of
coastal shipping and the sale of the three international
airports.
   It's the stuff of a private businessman's dreams. Yet
business is uneasy. Executives say the government hasn't
reined in spending, particularly on social programs, and they
fear increased taxes to foot the bill. They argue that the
government has been slow to tackle areas, such as the labor
market, that are keeping costs high and discouraging exports.
Moreover, they say the economy still is riddled with
regulations and relatively high tariffs.
   "It's quite wrong to see New Zealand as some kind of Hong
Kong," says Roger Kerr, a spokesman for the New Zealand
Business Roundtable. The government's momentum slowed after
it was re-elected in 1987, thus delaying the benefits of the
economic shake-up. Now, he says, "we're paying the price of
that breather."
   While the cost of the restructuring so far has been high
unemployment, which is currently about 7% of the labor force
as measured by internationally comparable standards, Mr.
Caygill maintains that his party's policies have arrested the
decline of New Zealand's living standards and resulted in a
more diversified economy that is less dependent on foreign
borrowings.
   The government and private borrowers owe foreign creditors
a total of more than NZ$47 billion (US$27.09 billion),
equivalent to about 70% of the country's economic output.
Interest payments alone consume about 20% of the country's
export earnings, helping to constrain economic growth.
   In 1989, a surge in imports and a decline in exports,
partly due to a drought, ballooned New Zealand's
current-account deficit to NZ$3.47 billion, or 5% of economic
output, from NZ$939 million, or 1.5%, in 1988. Economists
expect the deficit to widen further for at least the next
several months, thereby boosting the country's foreign debt.
   The government's goal is to slash inflation to below 2% by
December 1992. For the past year, inflation has been hovering
at about 7%, but that includes a one-time boost from a 2.5%
increase in a tax on goods and services. Some economists say
that using high interest rates to drive down inflation
bolsters the value of the local currency and makes the
country's exports more expensive than they otherwise would
be. That is undermining the productivity gains industries
have made, they argue, and comes at a time when the world
economy and export demand are slowing.

   TRW `Space Tug'
   Canceled by NASA
   To Preserve Funds

   WASHINGTON -- The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said it canceled TRW Inc.'s $736 million
project to build a "space tug" that could boost satellites
into higher orbits.
   The cancellation reflects the severe budget pressures
facing NASA, which recently scaled back the project in hopes
of saving it. The Bush administration has asked Congress to
approve a 24% increase in the NASA budget, to $15.13 billion,
in the coming fiscal year, but lawmakers are expected to vote
a substantially smaller increase. A NASA spokesman said the
agency wanted to preserve funds to renovate the space shuttle
and its main engines.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The space tug -- officially known as the Orbital
Maneuvering Vehicle -- looked more like a flying saucer than
a tugboat. It was an unmanned craft 15 feet in diameter that
would have been carried into orbit on the space shuttle for
the first time in January 1995. The tug's main purpose was to
boost the Hubble Space Telescope and a proposed X-ray
telescope into higher orbits to increase their orbital life.
The space shuttle also can boost the telescopes, but not as
high as the tug could have.
   NASA had grander designs for the space tug when it started
work on the project in 1986. The craft was supposed to help
build NASA's proposed space station, pull useless satellites
out of orbit and go into orbit around the Earth itself to
await new orders. But the project quickly ran into trouble.
   Harold Coldwater, a space-tug manager at NASA's Marshall
Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said the project had
a cost overrun of about $110 million. The project fell 18
months behind schedule and, overall, was running at about
twice its original cost estimate, NASA said.
   Last fall, the space agency tried to save the project by
cutting back the tug's capabilities. By choosing cheaper
rockets and less sophisticated navigation, the agency reduced
the tug's ability to maneuver in space and to boost
satellites. It also gave up the ability to base the tug at
the space station -- which had fallen well behind schedule
too -- or have it orbit independently.
   But the reprogramming left the tug with too little to do,
and NASA decided it was better off spending its money
elsewhere. William Lenoir, NASA's associate administrator for
space flight, said he figures the space agency will
eventually need a tug-like capability but that NASA has at
least two or three years to decide exactly what kind of craft
will be necessary.
   NASA estimated it has spent $200 million so far on the
tug, which was still in the design stage. However, canceling
the project won't help NASA immediately with its budget
problems. The space agency had asked Congress for $85 million
for the program in the coming fiscal year -- just about the
amount it said it needs to close down the project.

   Agreements Reached at Summit Appear to Be
   More Favorable to U.S. Than Critics Maintain

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush's summit meeting with Mikhail
Gorbachev had hardly begun when the cries arose: Mr. Bush was
selling out by making concessions on strategic arms and by
signing a trade pact without forcing an end to the Kremlin's
crackdown on Lithuania.
   The drumbeat of criticism is coming mostly from
conservatives, led by former Pentagon officials Richard Perle
and Frank Gaffney, who has an active fax machine and
extensive contacts in the press. Some liberals, such as
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), have
picked up some of their points.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But a closer look at the arms and trade moves suggests
that Mr. Bush didn't give away nearly as much as the attacks
suggest, according to analyses not only inside the
administration but by outside analysts. In some cases Soviet
benefits are illusory and in others the U.S. seems to be the
clear winner. Accordingly, the political dangers to Mr. Bush
may be considerably less than would be the case if there were
a full-scale conservative attack. "In the immediate
post-summit climate, the attacks are meaningless," says Kevin
Phillips, a Republican political theorist.
   The summit did fail to advance Mr. Bush's key
foreign-policy goals: unifying Germany in the West and
rolling back Soviet troops in Europe.
   But on strategic-arms control, the treaty nearing
completion will be lopsided in most respects in favor of the
U.S. And on Lithuania, Mr. Bush has shifted to a strategy of
using congressional pressure to force Mr. Gorbachev into
easing his crackdown before the pact is ratified. That
ensures that months, at least, will pass before real trade
benefits flow to Moscow.
   "On START {the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty}, we got
most of the restrictions we were looking for," maintains
Michael Mandelbaum, an analyst at the Council on Foreign
Relations. And on Lithuania, says Rep. Jim Leach, an Iowa
Republican, Congress is "making very clear that the Baltics
matter," leaving Mr. Bush free to avoid "backing Gorbachev
into a corner from which there is no maneuverability."
   Among those who disagree, the drumbeat of criticism began
the week before the summit, when Secretary of State James
Baker went to Moscow to settle key arms-control provisions
that made up the joint summit statement on strategic weapons.
   In the following days, influential conservative
commentators blasted Mr. Baker for caving in to Soviet
demands. Actively pushing the attack is the Center for
Security Policy, a small think tank run by Mr. Gaffney, an
informed and articulate conservative who was a top Pentagon
arms-control official from 1983 to 1987. Mr. Gaffney has
established a reputation for quickly providing journalists
and analysts with pointed commentary on foreign-policy
issues.
   The center's final judgment on the Washington summit
accused Mr. Bush of making "the worst strategic
miscalculation on the part of a president of the United
States since the Yalta conference of 1945," when Franklin
Roosevelt agreed to a Soviet sphere of influence in Europe.
   Columnists William Safire and Rowland Evans and Robert
Novak, and an editorial in this newspaper, all complained.
The conservative Washington Times carried a banner headline
declaring: "Baker `sellout' in arms talks feared." Mr. Perle
strongly sounded the same charges in commentaries before,
during and after the summit.
   Some lawmakers echo the complaints about Lithuania, with
Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas warning after
the summit that "if the Lithuania or the Baltic problem isn't
resolved, then I think it will become a matter of great
concern."
   In an interview, Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R., Wyo.) concedes
congressional conservatives haven't raised much of a ruckus
so far about the arms-control deals. But he called the recent
arms concessions "a serious error that will tie us down on
military technology." He said "it's arms control as a
political process, not a strategic process," adding that "the
administration has decided that there is but one overriding
U.S. national interest, and that is Gorbachev's survival.
They're willing to subordinate all other goals to that."
   On arms control, the critics have many gripes but have
zeroed in on two key issues: long-range cruise missiles,
where the U.S. has an edge; and "heavy" multiple-warhead,
land-based, ballistic missiles, where Moscow has a monopoly.
   The critics charge that, by agreeing to an upper limit of
880 sea-launched cruise missiles, Mr. Bush wrote off a major
U.S. advantage, and tempted Congress to cut the programs.
   But the deal worked out by Mr. Baker in Moscow, and
sanctioned at the summit, actually meets an American demand
that sea-launched cruise missiles be excluded altogether from
the legally binding treaty limits and verification
procedures. Instead, they are to be covered only by
"politically binding declarations" in which each side will
merely state how many it will build. In return, Mr. Baker --
with Pentagon and White House concurrence -- agreed that the
U.S. wouldn't declare an intention to build more than 880 of
the weapons, well above the total of 758 the Navy says it
needs.
   On air-launched cruise missiles, fired from the wings of
bombers, the critics lambaste the administration for agreeing
to count all such weapons with a range of more than 600
kilometers and for making promises about a new conventional
cruise missile code-named "Tacit Rainbow."
   But the U.S. actually won the right to exclude as many as
1,500 of the weapons from treaty limits vs. 840 for the
U.S.S.R. And Mr. Baker managed to exempt the exotic "Tacit
Rainbow" missile merely by stating that the Air Force only
plans a nonnuclear version.
   On heavy missiles, the critics complain that the U.S. has
agreed that some modernization of the Soviets' huge SS-18
will be permitted. They contend that by upgrading the SS-18s,
Moscow could fully offset cuts in the number of missiles.
   But the treaty as it stands would slash the SS-18 force in
half, from 308 missiles to 154. And no amount of improvement
is likely to offset that cut, according to former defense
secretary Harold Brown, because nuclear-war planners
generally seek to aim two warheads at each target. Further,
the U.S. is still pressing to effectively cut off further
SS-18 modernization after 1992.
   Overall, experts estimate that the treaty will widen the
U.S. lead in nuclear warheads and deprive Moscow of its
historic edge in ballistic missiles.
   On the trade issue, there isn't any doubt that Mr. Bush
gave Mr. Gorbachev a symbolic political prize by signing the
trade pact while the Kremlin is still squeezing Lithuania.
But in more substantive terms, Mr. Bush has made it clear to
the Soviets that he won't send the trade deal to Congress for
approval, and won't take the related step of granting the
Soviets most-favored-nation trade status, until the Soviet
legislature passes a new law guaranteeing Soviet Jews
expanded rights to emigrate.
   Beyond that, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker drove home to the
Soviets the need to keep the trade pact from becoming
entangled in a fight with Congress over Lithuania. To make
the point, Mr. Bush used a congressional action he initially
didn't like: a May 1 Senate resolution declaring that the
president shouldn't even bother sending Congress a new trade
deal for approval until the Kremlin's economic crackdown on
Lithuania is eased.
   As a result, both U.S. and Soviet officials suddenly find
it convenient to put off implementing the trade pact. Soviet
officials now are hinting that passage of their new
emigration law, the next step in the process, won't occur
until at least September. In the meantime, U.S. officials
hope that, by dangling a signed but unactivated trade treaty
before Mr. Gorbachev's eyes, they are giving a positive
incentive to get moving by then on Lithuania.
   By giving Congress the bad-cop role, Mr. Bush has let
others tie trade to the Baltics while avoiding formal linkage
that might rear its head again and again as ethnic issues
boil up in the future. Some think that's useful in the long
run. "I think we ought to think twice before we tie our
economic relationship to the Soviet Union to the satisfaction
of each and every grievance" by ethnic groups, says Mr.
Mandelbaum.

   DALLAS -- Chili's Inc. said it has called for redemption
July 6 its $35 million of 6.25% convertible subordinated
debentures due 2012 at a price of $1,057.81 per $1,000 face
amount, eliminating almost all of the restaurant company's
debt.
   Chili's said the debentures are convertible until June 26
into common stock at a price of $27.67 a share, or about 36
common shares per $1,000 bond. Assuming all the debentures
are converted to common stock, Chili's will issue 1.3 million
new common shares.

   The company currently has about 10.6 million shares and
stock options outstanding. Chili's said that under an
agreement with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Goldman will purchase
any debentures that aren't converted and then will convert
its holding to common stock.

   WHITE HOUSE WORRY: Will Greenspan cut rates to support a
budget deal?
   The Fed chairman's tight-fisted policies have
administration officials on edge. They believe last month's
weak employment growth should have prodded the Fed to ease;
they argue that with the economy already growing at less than
2% a year, a stingy Fed could mistakenly tip that into
negative numbers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the big issue, Bush aides say, is whether the Fed will
provide a major cut in short-term rates if there is a budget
accord with Congress. The administration thinks a deal should
be worth at least 1 1/2 percentage points. But Greenspan
indicates the Fed would pursue a more cautious path.
   "The odds are high they will move when the time comes,"
says an administration aide. "The question is whether it will
be far enough or fast enough."
                                                                                                       

   MANDELA AIMS to use his U.S. trip to keep the heat on
South Africa.
   Despite President de Klerk's partial lifting of the state
of emergency, the African National Congress leader will use
his June 26 speech to a joint session of Congress to rebut
arguments from U.S. conservatives that sanctions should be
eased. He will stress the importance of isolating South
Africa until apartheid truly is dead.
   The rest of his trip will be used to generate U.S.
political support and raise money. In addition to a New York
ticker-tape parade, he plans appearances in Boston, Atlanta,
Detroit and Oakland, as well as a Miami address to AFSCME to
thank organized labor for its anti-apartheid stance. A major
event in Los Angeles will seek financial support from the
entertainment industry.
                                                                                                       

   SUMMIT DEALS raise political hackles in both the Soviet
Union and U.S.
   Soviet press commentaries increasingly complain that while
the Soviets are giving up their military edge on land, Bush
refuses to negotiate cuts in navies, a traditional area of
American strength. Shevardnadze warns Baker that the newly
independent Supreme Soviet might balk at ratifying pacts it
sees as unequal.
   In the U.S., meanwhile, conservatives criticize the trade
treaty and other economic moves as sops to Gorbachev just
when he is losing power to Yeltsin and others. "Bush is about
six months behind in understanding how far along the
disintegration of the Soviet Union is," says Heritage
Foundation official Kim Holmes.
   Conservatives complain the chemical weapons treaty isn't
verifiable.
                                                                                                       

   DEMOCRATS CHEER the weak showing of Montana GOP Senate
candidate Kolstad in Tuesday's primary; they now think Sen.
Baucus could have an easier time than anticipated. The
Republicans, meanwhile, say North Carolina Sen. Helms will
have no problem painting Democratic nominee Gantt, who is
black, as ultraliberal. But Democratic strategists think
Gantt will be able to raise a lot of money for his uphill
battle.
                                                                                                       

   SPRING SLUMP? The high-powered Democratic political
consulting firm of Doak, Shrum &amp; Associates isn't off to a
good start this year. Their candidates have already lost
high-stakes gubernatorial primaries in Texas, California and
Iowa, and trail in Georgia and Florida. Says Bob Shrum:
"Unlike some people in this business, we do difficult
campaigns."
                                                                                                       

   NERVOUS REGULATORS await Tuesday's first-quarter banking
report. Delinquencies on consumer loans have been creeping up
in recent quarters; the number typically drops off in the
first quarter, but that might not happen this time, which
would indicate consumers are living beyond their means and
that banks ought to worry.
                                                                                                       

   INFRA REDS: Gorbachev had hardly left town when salesmen
for the Soviet space agency arrived to pitch their Almaz
radar satellite, which can take pictures through cloud cover
and at night. The Soviets believe the technology --
originally developed to track U.S. aircraft carriers -- will
draw customers ranging from oil companies to urban planners.
                                                                                                       

   PRESSURE GROWS to allow more flights into already
congested airports.
   Prodded by upstart America West Airlines, the Senate
Commerce Committee is working on a bill to loosen or
eliminate limits on the number of flights into LaGuardia,
JFK, O'Hare and Washington National. Landing rights are
currently dominated by more-established carriers, leading
newer competitors to complain they are shut out of lucrative
markets.
   Transportation Department officials worry that changing
the current system would increase noise and overcrowding
problems, and could raise safety questions as well. To defuse

   Davis Testifies
   Mulheren Offered
   To Monitor Boesky

   Martin S. Davis, the chairman of Paramount Communications
Inc., said that John A. Mulheren Jr. offered to secretly
monitor the activities of Ivan F. Boesky in connection with
Paramount.
   Testifying on behalf of the government in the conspiracy
and securities fraud trial of Mr. Mulheren, Mr. Davis said he
met with Mr. Mulheren in October 1985, only two days after he
met with Mr. Boesky and Carl C. Icahn, the New York financier
who is chairman of TWA Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Davis said Mr. Mulheren phoned him and asked if
Paramount's predecessor company, Gulf &amp; Western Inc., would
join with a group led by Mr. Mulheren to acquire CBS Inc., a
transaction that never occurred. Mr. Davis said Mr. Mulheren
also "stated he could be very helpful to us in monitoring the
activities of Ivan Boesky" in Gulf &amp; Western stock. "He was
in agreement with positions I stated about Mr. Boesky," which
were "nothing complimentary," Mr. Davis said.
   Mr. Mulheren is charged with, among other things,
manipulating the price of Gulf &amp; Western shares at the
request of Mr. Boesky. The government has accused Mr.
Mulheren of buying 75,000 Gulf &amp; Western shares on Oct. 17,
1985, in an effort to boost the market price of Gulf &amp;
Western stock so that Mr. Boesky could sell his 4.9% stake in
the company at a higher price than the shares might otherwise
have traded on that day. Mr. Boesky sold his Gulf &amp; Western
stake to the company that day.
   Mr. Davis said that when Mr. Mulheren indicated he agreed
with Mr. Davis's unfavorable view of Mr. Boesky, Mr. Davis
didn't know that Mr. Mulheren was then a co-trustee of trusts
established for Mr. Boesky's children.
   Shortly after Mr. Mulheren offered his assistance, Mr.
Davis said, Mr. Mulheren called Mr. Davis to say that he did
not believe that Mr. Boesky held any Gulf &amp; Western shares.
However, Mr. Davis indicated in his testimony that he knew
that Mr. Boesky held 4.9% of Gulf &amp; Western's stock at that
time.
   Mr. Davis also testified about two separate meetings he
held with both Mr. Icahn and Mr. Boesky, each of whom held
4.9% stakes in Gulf &amp; Western in October 1985. At the first
meeting, held in September 1985, Mr. Boesky proposed a
buy-out of Gulf &amp; Western, an offer Mr. Davis rejected. At
the second meeting, in October of that year, Mr. Boesky
proposed that Gulf &amp; Western repurchase his shares at $45 a
share.
   The night before Oct. 17, 1985, Mr. Boesky again
reiterated he wanted to sell his shares at $45 each. But the
company's stock was then trading slightly below $45, and Mr.
Davis told Mr. Boesky he would pay the market price for the
stock.
   The following day, when the stock reached $45 in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. Boesky and Mr. Icahn sold
their shares at the price Mr. Boesky had sought.
   "Did you view" Mr. Icahn and Mr. Boesky "to be acting in
concert?" Mr. Davis was asked by Thomas Puccio, the attorney
for Mr. Mulheren. "No," Mr. Davis responded. Mr. Davis, who
said Mr. Icahn is "someone I know well," said he didn't
believe Mr. Icahn would necessarily do whatever Mr. Boesky
did.

   Chrysler's Iacocca Agrees to Remain
   At Helm After Contract Ends in 1991

<LP>
   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Lee A. Iacocca, who led Chrysler
Corp.'s comeback in the 1980s, agreed to stay with the auto
maker through the turbulence rocking it in the early 1990s.
   After Chrysler's regular board meeting yesterday, the
65-year-old Mr. Iacocca said he would remain as the auto
maker's chairman and chief executive officer past the
expiration of his contract in December 1991. For several
months Mr. Iacocca has refused to disclose his plans, but the
recent departure of Gerald Greenwald, vice chairman and heir
apparent, prompted the announcement that he would extend his
tenure.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "When I came to Chrysler, I enlisted for the duration," he
said. "Right now there's a battle raging and I'm not going to
leave my troops in the field."
   Mr. Iacocca left vague exactly how much longer he will
stay. Chrysler officials said his new plans have no end date.
"He will stay until he and the board decide his day-to-day
involvement is no longer needed," a company spokesman said.
   "I've got a responsibility, and I'm going to see it
through," Mr. Iacocca said. "But I want to emphasize that I
have no intention of being carried out of the place."
   Among the tasks Mr. Iacocca said he wants to complete
before leaving is the creation of a clear line of management
succession. He has two obvious potential successors, but both
currently have drawbacks.
   Robert S. Miller Jr. was named Chrysler vice chairman in
the wake of Mr. Greenwald's resignation to lead the employee
buy-out of United Airlines. Mr. Miller is relatively young at
48 years old. He played a crucial role in the Chrysler
bailout by keeping the company's bankers satisfied. But Mr.
Miller has limited experience outside of financial operations
where he has spent his entire automotive career with Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler.
   The other potential successor to Mr. Iacocca is Robert A.
Lutz, 58, president of Chrysler's automotive operations. Mr.
Lutz has wide-ranging experience, including a solid track
record during the mid-1980s as chairman of Ford of Europe, a
huge company in itself. But he has only been with Chrysler
for four years.
   Another top executive, Bennett E. Bidwell, chairman of
Chrysler's auto operations, is 62 years old. But Mr. Bidwell
has indicated he may retire early next year, partly because
of health reasons, although it isn't yet certain that he'll
leave.
   Some Chrysler executives say privately that Mr. Iacocca
may have stayed on the job too long and that, despite his
many strengths and forceful presence, the company could
benefit from fresh leadership. But they acknowledge that his
departure would be problematic now, especially from a
public-relations standpoint. That's because Mr. Greenwald was
the third top executive to leave recently -- although the
departures appear quite coincidental.
   Just before Mr. Greenwald left, the company announced that
Vice President and Treasurer Frederick W. Zuckerman would be
leaving soon. But Mr. Zuckerman agreed about four months ago
to leave his post, and the announcement was delayed while he
explored several future opportunities.
   The other recent Chrysler departee was Michael N. Hammes,
vice president of Chrysler's international operations. He
left to join Black &amp; Decker Corp., and Chrysler officials say
he got a significant increase in total pay.
   Despite these separate circumstances, Mr. Iacocca's
decision to extend his stay appears partly designed to
counteract an impression that Chrysler faces a mass exodus
from the executive suite.
   The company's sales have fared poorly in recent months.
Chrysler, which held 11.3% of the U.S. car market in 1988,
claimed 10.3% last year and just 8.9% for the first five
months of 1990. Chrysler posted a record $664 million loss in
last year's fourth quarter.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Chrysler rose 12.5 cents a share to $16.125.

   House Panel Approves $20.9 Billion
   Energy and Water Bill for Fiscal 1991

   WASHINGTON -- A House Appropriations subcommittee approved
a $20.9 billion fiscal 1991 energy and water bill providing
$318 million for the superconducting supercollider and adding
substantially to President Bush's budget for cleaning up
nuclear-weapons plants.
   An estimated $2.7 billion would be allocated to the
military component of the Energy Department's program in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, a 41% increase from current
spending. An additional $563.7 million would be provided for
related domestic accounts, and the total of nearly $3.28
billion for the cleanup represents an increase of $488
million from the administration's budget request and more
than $1 billion from the current year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We have to move faster," said Rep. Tom Bevill (D., Ala.),
chairman of the subcommittee. "This is a critical situation
and I wanted to make sure we have the necessary resources to
clean up this mess."
   Within Congress, the cleanup of hazardous materials at the
weapons plants commands strong bipartisan support. But as the
first of the appropriations bills slated to come before the
House, the high costs of the energy and water legislation are
sure to draw opposition. The measure represents a net
increase of approximately $541 million above the
administration's budget for comparable accounts, and White
House Budget Director Richard Darman has sought to delay any
action until an agreement is reached on a final spending plan
for the new fiscal year.
   The subcommittee action came as a closed-door meeting of
Democratic leaders of the full Appropriations Committee
approved tentative allocations for the 13 spending bills to
fund the government in fiscal 1991. Discretionary
appropriations for foreign aid would be increased to an
estimated $15.1 billion, in close conformity with the
president's request. But elsewhere, Pentagon funding would be
cut deeply to offset increases in domestic spending. The
major Pentagon bill would be held to $262.8 billion, compared
with $287.1 billion under Mr. Bush's budget, while at the
same time, the two largest domestic appropriations bills
would grow by more than $10 billion over the administration's
request.
   Discretionary funding for the Departments of Labor, Health
and Human Services, and Education would be set at
approximately $52.75 billion, for example, compared with
$46.2 billion requested by the administration. Housing,
environmental, veterans, and space programs would grow to
$63.4 billion, compared with the $59.2 billion sought
initially by the president.
   Though the bill approved yesterday by the subcommittee
fell within the guidelines of the House-passed budget
resolution, the legislation invites criticism by adding tens
of millions of dollars for new research and
water-construction projects favored by influential members.
In a step sure to provoke controversy, the subcommittee broke
with its practice in recent years and provided a total of $40
million to $50 million in grants to five select universities
for science facilities backed by senior appropriators from
Ohio, Alabama, Louisiana, Massachusetts and Indiana.
   Mr. Bevill, for example, secured $10 million for a
biomedical building at the University of Alabama, and Rep.
Silvio Conte, the ranking Republican on the full
Appropriations Committee, added an undisclosed sum for Boston
College.
   Though the full details weren't available after the
closed-door meeting, Rep. John Myers, the ranking Republican
on the subcommittee, won funding for Indiana State, while the
University of New Orleans and Case Western University would
benefit from funding backed by Reps. Lindy Boggs (D., La.)
and Louis Stokes (D., Ohio).
   Within the Bureau of Reclamation, an estimated $30 million
is provided for the Garrison irrigation and water-diversion
unit in North Dakota. Though controversial in the
administration's eyes, the sum was justified as a compromise
between Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) and wildlife proponents
opposed to the immense project.
   Elsewhere, Army Corps of Engineers construction funding
would grow to $1.36 billion, a nearly 11% increase from the
president's budget and including as many as 25 new
construction starts.
   For the White House, the Texas-based superconducting
supercollider is a major political priority, and the $318
million represents the president's full request and a more
than 45% increase from what was appropriated for the current
year. More than half the total, approximately $168.8 million,
is expected to be allocated for early construction of the
immense atom smasher, and the remainder is divided $33
million for capital equipment and $116 million for operations
and research and development.
   The administration is pursuing foreign support to help
offset the burgeoning costs of the project. But after making
cuts for this year, both the House and Senate Appropriations
Committees appear prepared to proceed at least at the level
sought by the president.
   Though the administration has so far resisted, House rules
permit the Appropriations Committee to proceed with its bills
after May 15, whether or not a formal budget has been adopted
by Congress. The Senate needs only a simple majority -- not
60 votes -- to waive restrictions and follow suit, and
whatever the merits of the House-passed budget, it can be
argued that it provides more discipline than no resolution at
all.

   Vice Chairman
   To Leave Post

   Johnson to Take Position
   As Economics Professor,
   Director at University

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)
EXECUTIVE (EXE)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Manuel Johnson, influential vice chairman of
the Federal Reserve, announced he will leave the Fed when his
term expires Aug. 3 to return to academia.
   Mr. Johnson, who has served in government for the past 10
years, will become the Koch Professor of International
Economics and will serve as director of the new Center for
Global Market Studies at George Mason University in Fairfax,
Va.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, he will become co-chairman of a new
commission called the G-7 Council, which will be a private
sounding board for ideas on improving the management of the
global economy.
   President Bush was prepared to renominate Mr. Johnson to
the vice chairman's post, according to administration
officials. Mr. Johnson's decision to leave partly reflects a
calculation that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan will be
reappointed to the top Fed post when his term expires next
year, in which case it would be at least five years before
Mr. Johnson would have a shot at becoming chairman.
   Moreover, even if Mr. Greenspan does leave next year, Mr.
Johnson's recent scraps with the Bush Treasury Department
might prevent him from getting the president's nod for the
top post. On a number of occasions, he has criticized efforts
by the department to intervene in exchange markets to drive
down the value of the dollar.
   Mr. Johnson, who has children aged eight and 12, also will
be able to earn considerably more money in his new jobs. The
posts at George Mason, which is a privately endowed chair,
will pay $120,000 a year, compared with the $89,000 he earns
at the Fed. In addition, Mr. Johnson said he will receive "a
modest salary" as co-chairman of the G-7 Council. And he will
be able to collect speaking fees, which he cannot as Fed vice
chairman.
   In an interview, Mr. Johnson said money wasn't the main
reason for his departure, but added: "Anybody who serves 10
years in government has to make a financial sacrifice."
   Mr. Johnson has close ties to the Bush administration, and
particularly to Secretary of State James Baker, so it's
unlikely his departure came as a surprise to the White House.
Nevertheless, the Fed vice chairman didn't give official
notice of his departure until yesterday.
   Since joining the Fed in 1986, Mr. Johnson has tended to
favor looser monetary policies than the majority of his
colleagues. Lately, however, he has been a leading voice
against further cuts in short-term interest rates.
   In searching for a replacement to Mr. Johnson, the Bush
administration is likely to look for someone who shares its
belief that the Greenspan Fed has tended to be too quick to
tighten its policies, and too slow to ease.
   President Bush's only appointee to the seven-member Fed
board so far has been David Mullins, former assistant
Treasury secretary. It's possible Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady will suggest Mr. Mullins for the No. 2 spot. But
because Mr. Mullins is new at the Fed, his elevation could
cause resentment among more experienced Fed governors and
might be opposed by Chairman Greenspan. Moreover, if the
administration makes Mr. Mullins vice chairman, it still will
have to find another person to fill the vacant Fed seat.
   As a result, the White House may be more likely to look
outside the Fed for a vice chairman. One person who has been
mentioned is economist John Taylor, a member of President
Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Taylor is scheduled
to return to his teaching job at Stanford University next
year. But he might be persuaded to stay and take the vice
chairman's post.
   The administration will have to move quickly if it wants
to have a new vice chairman chosen and confirmed by the
Senate before Mr. Johnson leaves Aug. 3.
   Mr. Johnson began his career in government in the Reagan
Treasury Department, where he was a fervent "supply-sider"
advocating tax cuts. Unlike other supply-siders, however, he
became noted for his diplomatic skills, which enabled him to
work closely with such disparate personalities as former
Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, former Treasury Secretary
Baker, former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and Mr. Greenspan.
   Mr. Greenspan issued a statement saying, "I deeply regret
but understand" Mr. Johnson's decision. "The vice chairman
and I have been an effective team. I'll miss him."
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers, said: "We have a very high regard for Vice
Chairman Johnson, and greatly appreciate the service he has
rendered."
   Mr. Johnson will co-chair the G-7 Council with Washington
consultant David Smick. The group, which initially will be
set up for 30 months, will include a broad range of academics
and former government officials such as former Japanese Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, according to Mr. Smick. It will be
an independent, non-partisan group, financed largely by
foundations. It will support the efforts of the "Group of
Seven," which consists of the finance ministers and central
bankers of the seven leading industrial nations.
   "We want to see if we can't develop useful options for the
official G-7," Mr. Johnson said.
   In recent months, Mr. Johnson has been a critic of the G-7
coordination process, arguing that it has lacked energy and
purpose. In the interview, he said that events such as the
"explosion in Eastern Europe and the unification of Germany"
make the need for economic coordination among the seven
nations greater than ever.
   The G-7 nations are the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Canada and Italy.

   EL PASO, Texas -- Farah Inc. said it will call a special
shareholders meeting in early August at the request of
William F. Farah, the company's former chairman.
   Mr. Farah, who owns roughly 15% of the apparel maker's
stock, requested the meeting so that he can try to remove at
least six of Farah's nine directors and replace them with his
own nominees.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Farah, 70 years old, who retired as Farah chief
executive last July, was removed as company chairman in April
in a dispute with other board members. Thomas G. Wyman, a
company director, was named chairman.
   Mr. Farah, who remains a director of the company his
father founded, has said he would like Mr. Wyman to remain a
director, but Mr. Wyman says he wouldn't serve on Mr. Farah's
board. Mr. Farah also said he would retain Charles C. Wood as
a director.
   The company said in April that Mr. Farah had asked
directors to either remove current management or to resign as
directors, and they refused. Farah said that all of its
directors except Mr. Wood advised Mr. Farah at a board
meeting last week that his actions aren't in shareholders'
best interests and could hurt the company.
   Mr. Farah also has sued the company in El Paso county
court.
   In an interview, Mr. Wyman said that several decisions
that Mr. Farah made during his tenure, including a temporary
move to sell apparel to discounters and a failure to maintain
quality control at new foreign production plants, have
contributed to Farah's operating losses.
   For the six months ended April 30, Farah had a net loss of
$2 million, or 32 cents a share, on sales of $59.9 million.

   Compensating Victims of Nuclear Disaster

   A presidential commission studying how the legal system
could best cope with massive litigation resulting from a
nuclear disaster has outlined a plan for compensating
victims.
   The Presidential Commission on Catastrophic Nuclear
Accidents is expected to present a draft of its proposal to
President Bush within the next two weeks. The plan is
expected to be submitted to Congress on Aug. 20.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to a nearly final draft of the report, the
Commission recommends that all state and federal claims be
consolidated in one federal court. That court would then make
general findings such as who is responsible for the accident
and what injuries could be directly traced to the incident.
The court would also establish a standardized system of
paying for different types of claims, such as personal injury
or property damage.
   Further, the report calls for awarding compensation on the
basis of the urgency of the victims' needs. Those with
immediate medical and housing needs would get paid first.
Death claims, property devaluations, and reimbursement to
cities for ambulance and evacuation costs, fall into a
secondary category.
   One of the most complicated aspects of compensating
victims of mass disasters is deciding to what degree an
injury or illness might have been caused by the accident. The
Commission's solution is a sliding scale of compensation
based on the likelihood of causation.
   If an individual who fought a fire resulting from the
nuclear accident developed leukemia, he or she would receive
100% of the claim. A person 80 miles downwind from the
accident might receive only a percentage of the claim. If an
individual with no symptoms remains fearful, the potential
victim would be eligible for free medical monitoring.
   The commission, chaired by Steven C. Griffith Jr., the
senior vice president of Duke Power Co., was created in 1988
as part of the reauthorization of a 1957 bill known as the
Price-Anderson Act. The Act effectively allows for a federal
insurance program to compensate victims of a nuclear accident
as if it were a natural disaster. The original ceiling on
liability was $560 million, a figure equal at the time to the
total of private nuclear insurance and government indemnity
available to pay public liability claims.
   The reauthorization bill raised the limit to $7.3 billion
and established the Commission to decide who would get the
money and how it would be distributed.
   Commission members heard testimony from nuclear insurers
and plaintiffs attorneys involved in the Three Mile Island
accident, from scientists with expertise on the Soviet
nuclear accident at Chernobyl, as well as legal experts on
mass disaster litigation.
   Stanley Chesley, a plaintiffs attorney in Cincinnati who
has not seen the report, was critical of the two-tiered
compensation plan. "If the money is available, there should
not be two stages," he said. "Those people at the bottom will
never see justice."
   ---
   USE OF WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS restricted by Texas Supreme
Court.
   The Texas court said a written disclaimer in a sales
contract "must be conspicuous to a reasonable person."
Writing for the court, Justice Lloyd Doggett said a
disclaimer included in text that is "undistinguished in
typeface, size or color" doesn't qualify unless the buyer had
"actual knowledge" of it. Another court member, Franklin
Spears, called on the state legislature to abolish
implied-warranty disclaimers.
   Courts have for years upheld implied warranties, under
which makers and sellers of goods are presumed to guarantee
the quality of their products. However, many state laws also
permit businesses to disclaim such warranties in their sales
contracts as long as buyers are put on notice. Whether the
notice is sufficient is a question that often sparks
litigation.
   Cate's Transmission Service, a Texarkana, Texas, business
had brought the suit, alleging breach of implied warranty
against Dover Corp., a New York company which made three
vehicle lifts purchased by Cates. The plaintiff said the
lifts never worked, but two lower courts summarily dismissed
the case, upholding Dover's claim that the suit was barred by
a disclaimer in the sales contract.
   The Supreme Court said the disclaimer wasn't conspicuous
enough and sent the case back for trial.
   ---
   JUDICIAL NOMINEES' membership in discriminatory clubs is
debated.
   Some Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are
pushing for a resolution that would brand as "inappropriate"
any federal judicial nomination of a person belonging to a
discriminatory club.
   The proposed nonbinding resolution was opposed by
conservative Republicans during a committee hearing. "We must
not focus on one issue, the club issue," said the ranking GOP
member, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. But he added, "I
oppose discrimination in any form."
   Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) labeled the Democratic
resolution "a litmus test" that would be hypocritical because
some of the senators themselves belong to clubs that exclude
women and nonwhites. Thomas Boyd, the Justice Department's
director of policy development, said after the hearing that
the agency agreed with the intent of the two-page resolution
but that its wording was ambiguous and required refinement.
   The judiciary panel is expected to vote on the highly
unusual resolution within the next few weeks. The outcome is
uncertain, although Democrats have already received support
from Sen. Arlen Specter, a politically moderate Republican
from Pennsylvania.
   The issue of discriminatory club membership has cropped up
repeatedly in confirmation hearings, including those of
Justice Anthony Kennedy and the Justice Department's civil
rights chief, John Dunne. Both Mr. Dunne and Mr. Kennedy quit
exclusionary clubs in connection with their nominations.
   Proponents of the resolution contend that important
business is conducted at private eating and sports clubs.
Exclusionary practices "deny women and minorities a full and
fair opportunity to participate in the economic life of their
communities," said Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), the
resolution's prime sponsor along with Sen. Howard Metzenbaum
(D., Ohio).
   Representatives of women and minority professionals
testified strongly in favor of the resolution. But members of
some all-male organizations called the provision intrusive.
   Reno Menapace, an Ohio lawyer speaking on behalf of the
Loyal Order of Moose, said that membership in that all-male
organization shouldn't "be viewed as a tacit endorsement of
discriminatory practice." He said the order has an auxiliary
called Women of the Moose.

   TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES sue AT&amp;T over 900 number.
   Mirage Studios, creator of the popular comic-book
characters that were the basis of a movie, is seeking damages
of $105 million from American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Phone
Programs Inc., SBK Records Group and WPIX Inc. The suit,
filed in federal court in New York, claims the 900 number,
which charges callers $3 to listen to a daily recording about
turtle superheroes, is "strictly a rip-off" of the trademark.
The recordings unlawfully use terms such as "Turtle Power"
and "Cowabunga," associated with the trademark, the suit
said.
   The suit said SBK of New York was granted the right to
sell the movie soundtrack, but not to provide a 900 number.
It seeks a court order banning AT&amp;T from billing customers
for the service and demanding that the number be
disconnected. In the suit, Mirage said AT&amp;T and the other
defendants have ignored requests to halt the service.
   A spokesman for AT&amp;T said the company hasn't seen the
suit. "We will look at the claims closely and see if they are
justified," he said.
   WPIX, a New York TV channel, is named as a defendant for
allegedly broadcasting commercials promoting the number.

   CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER RESIGNS from American Bar
Association.
   Jill Wine-Banks resigned as the highest staff member at
the ABA. Ms. Wine-Banks, a former Watergate prosecutor and
general counsel to the U.S. Army, said she will remain with
the ABA until a successor is named. She was the first woman
named to the post and has served for three years.
   According to one source at the ABA, Ms. Wine-Banks had
disagreed with the group's board of governors last month over
her compensation. But Ms. Wine-Banks denied that. "Salary had
nothing to do with this," she said, adding that she has long
thought about leaving and had other professional
opportunities available to her.
   "We accept Jill's decision with regret, and look forward
to having her back among us as a lawyer and an active ABA
member," said ABA president L. Stanley Chauvin Jr., of
Louisville, Ky.

   Nevada Power Co., Las Vegas, Nev., said about 900 clerical
and plant workers went out on strike, affecting the company's
entire operation.
   The company said it believed it could provide service for
its 328,000 existing customers by using supervisory and
salaried personnel. But new construction for residential and
business connections will be delayed or suspended, the
company said.

   "That's where the crunch is going to come," said David
Barneby, vice president for power supply. "We're in the midst
of a huge building boom here."
   The union local's business manager, Jim Brimer, disagreed.
"There will be tremendous delays in restoring service if
there are any power outtages," he said. Las Vegas has
experienced 100-degree heat all week. On Wednesday, members
of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
overwhelmingly rejected a tentative four-year contract. The
company rejected a new union proposal yesterday, prompting
the walkout. The major issues are wages, medical benefits and
overtime.

   Heard on the Street:
   Westinghouse's Stock-Boosting Tactics Win
   Plaudits as Real Estate Triggers Some Jitters

HEARD ON THE STREET (HRD)

</IN>
<LP>
   Westinghouse is winning acclaim from savvy money managers
for its recent stock-boosting tactics, including last month's
2-for-1 split and a recently unveiled stock buy-back plan.
   The last time the Pittsburgh-based giant took similar
steps, the stock more than doubled within two years. In the
buy-back of 1984-1986, the company shrank its shares
outstanding by 18%. And the stock, adjusted for splits, rose
from a little above 10 to a 1986 high of 31 1/4.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although the latest buy-back will pack less punch --
involving no more than 20 million shares, or about 7% of the
total outstanding -- it's a tonic that has proved potent
before.
   Several money managers view Westinghouse as a rarity in
today's market: a high quality stock that's relatively cheap.
At 37 1/2 yesterday, it sells for less than 12 times the past
12 month's per-share earnings, compared with more than 16
times for the average stock in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.
   Westinghouse's refusal, announced last week, to hide
behind the skirts of Pennsylvania anti-takeover law impresses
Craig Drill, who runs the New York hedge fund Craig Drill
Capital. The typical company, he says, "fights to put moats
around themselves."
   Although Westinghouse hasn't wowed Wall Street for some
time, its stock has provided a total return of better than
25% a year for a decade. "We've owned Westinghouse for about
10 years," says David Dreman, whose Dreman Value Management
holds more than 1.4 million shares. "It has sold below the
market multiple {the average ratio of stock prices to
corporate earnings} the whole 10-year period. But when you
add up the return, it's been about sevenfold."
   Kathleen Millard, who manages the Chase Equity Fund for
Chase Manhattan Bank's private-banking clients, notes that
Westinghouse is selling for a far lower multiple than General
Electric, which trades at around 15 times earnings.
Historically, GE has sold at some premium to Westinghouse,
she says, but "you want to buy Westinghouse when the spread
is wide."
   To be sure, some money managers and analysts are negative
on Westinghouse. Their biggest worry concerns real estate
loans by its finance unit, Westinghouse Financial Services
Inc.
   "Everybody's scared to death about the banks having highly
leveraged transactions exposure," says David E. Nelson of
Investment Counselors of Maryland. "But not many people
realize that {Westinghouse's finance unit} does the same kind
of lending." Investment Counselors sold almost all its
Westinghouse shares recently.
   Commercial real estate lending is 40% of the finance
unit's portfolio, and "nonperforming assets have gone from
7.9% to 15.2% of commercial real estate receivables," says
Michael Bunyaner, analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. The category
includes loans in arrears by 60 days or more, plus real
estate that has been repossessed and isn't yet sold. Many of
the properties are hotels and motels, a category afflicted by
"a great deal of overcapacity." Difficulties in the finance
unit are important, he says, because Westinghouse has relied
on it for a big part of its growth.
   In an interview, Paul Lego, Westinghouse's recently named
chief executive officer, said he considers the finance unit
"an excellent business." Though 1989 was a tough year for
real estate, he said, the unit had record results, and he
expects even better results for 1990.
   However, he says Westinghouse wants to gradually reduce
its real estate portfolio, without dumping properties on a
depressed market. "We have staying power," he said, adding:
"We have the wherewithal to stay with the properties until
the market improves."
   Other money managers are concerned because of
Westinghouse's slow sales growth. But Don Mitchell, chairman
of consultants Mitchell &amp; Co. in Weston, Mass., says sales
growth is slow because Westinghouse has been "very
disciplined about what businesses they keep," jettisoning
those with inadequate profit margins.
   The finance unit is one of six major business groups for
Westinghouse. The other five are broadcasting (20 radio and
five television stations); energy (mostly power-generation
equipment); industrial (including transport refrigeration
systems and electrical products); electronics (mainly serving
the military and the space program); and commercial
(furniture and Longines-Wittnauer watches, among other
things).
   The combined strength of the six units appeals to analysts
such as Candice Eggerss of Morgan Stanley and David S.
Gardner of Nomura Securities. Ms. Eggerss says demand for
Westinghouse's power-generating equipment should grow 10% a
year as utilities scramble to deal with impending energy
shortages in some parts of the country. Mr. Gardner says
recent weakness in the stock is "a perfect buying
opportunity."

   Transcisco Industries Inc., San Francisco, said it agreed
to make a "substantial" investment in Piper Aircraft Corp.
and to take over Piper's parts-distribution business.
   Transcisco said a letter of intent signed with Piper calls
for Transcisco to form a separate company to take over
Piper's world-wide parts business. Transcisco said the letter
also calls for it to receive warrants to acquire an
unspecified amount of stock in Piper, a troubled Vero Beach,
Fla., maker of small airplanes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The acquisition of the Piper business, if completed, would
fit into Transcisco's effort to expand transportation
businesses beyond the company's basic rail-equipment
maintenance-and-leasing operations, Transcisco said. More
than 90,000 piper airplanes are flying around the world, it
said, representing a large market for replacement parts.
   The transaction provides the privately held Piper with the
working capital it needs to deliver its order backlog of
aircraft, which Piper estimates at over $200 million, and to
develop new models, Transcisco said. Terms of the proposed
acquisition weren't revealed.

   Playboy Enterprises Inc., Chicago, said it completed a
recapitalization plan, under which it will convert its common
stock into voting and nonvoting classes.
   The proposal was criticized by some holders, but passage
was never in question, as it had the support of Hugh M.
Hefner, founder and former chairman, who holds a 71% stake in
the publishing and entertainment concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After the measure was approved, Playboy said, it carried
out a 1-for-2 reverse split of its common stock, and
reclassified that reduced number of shares as voting Class A
stock. It then paid a stock dividend of three shares of new
nonvoting Class B common stock for each share of Class A
common. The two classes will trade separately on the New York
Stock Exchange, beginning today, Playboy said.
   The dual-class arrangement will allow Mr. Hefner, should
he wish to do so, to retain his majority voting stake while
shedding up to three-quarters of his shares. That was what
irked some shareholders, including Industrial Equity
(Pacific) Ltd., which has a 7.6% Playboy stake.

spokesman said that Bio-Medicus's directors will meet to
consider the new proposal. He declined further comment.
   Under a 1987 pact, Medtronic can't boost its current 5.5%
stake in the company above 10% without Bio-Medicus board
approval.

   NEW YORK -- Metropolitan Asset Group Ltd. and Lambert
Brussels Real Estate Corp. agreed to buy the assets of U.S.
Shelter Corp., a troubled Greenville, S.C., real estate
syndicator.
   U.S. Shelter is a publicly held property manager and
savings bank owner. It also is general partner in about 150
real estate limited partnerships that own about 220
properties valued at about $700 million, Metropolitan Asset
Group said. Metropolitan Asset said it is difficult to value
U.S. Shelter's partnership interest in the portfolio, but
that it could be as high as $50 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, U.S. Shelter owns Malibu Savings Bank, a
California thrift with about $170 million in assets that
apparently isn't in compliance with new regulatory capital
requirements. U.S. Shelter also has a mortgage banking unit.
   Metropolitan Asset Group is a real estate investment
banking firm. Lambert Brussels Real Estate is the U.S.
investment arm of Pargesa Holding/Groupe Bruxelles Lambert.
   The pact calls for a Metropolitan Asset Group partnership
to provide a $6 million cash infusion into U.S. Shelter.
Also, Lambert Brussels would convert about 40% of its debt in
U.S. Shelter into equity.
   Lambert Brussels is U.S. Shelter's largest creditor, Mr.
Farkas said. Following the purchase, Metropolitan Asset Group
would hold 65% and Lambert Brussels 25% of the equity in the
new company.
   Mr. Farkas said "the reason we're doing this is to create
the largest real estate investment bank and workout entity in
the country." Mr. Farkas said that he envisions the company
"doing a sort of LBO of real estate limited partnerships."
   In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors buys a
company in a transaction financed largely by debt.
Ultimately, the group's borrowings are repaid with funds
generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its
assets.

   French Oil Group Set
   To Sell Headquarters,
   Boost Capital Base

   PARIS -- Total-Cie. Francaise des Petroles intends to put
its Paris headquarters up for sale in the near future, but
the oil concern gave no indication of the size of the capital
gain the sale would bring.
   Company Chairman Serge Tchuruk told shareholders that the
oil group also intends to boost its capital base in the near
future, but he declined to reveal the magnitude of the
planned capital increase.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Tchuruk said the group's financial performance since
the beginning of this year has been satisfactory in the
exploration and production sectors, while refining and
distribution businesses have been steady but still below
average industry levels of profitability in Europe.
   Mr. Tchuruk said it is "imperative" for Total to improve
its profitability. He pointed out that last year Total's
profitability, defined by earnings as a percentage of
revenue, was 6.4%, well below the industry average of 9%. He
said it was Total's firm intention to improve the group's
profitability to more than 10%, if possible, within the next
2 1/2 years.
   Answering shareholders' criticism that the group's
dividend has remained unchanged since 1985, Mr. Tchuruk said
Total shareholders fare much better than those of most other
big French groups in terms of dividend as a percentage of
earnings per share.
   In Total's case, this came out at 38% for 1989 compared
with 30% for a sample group of 14 big French industrial
groups, he said. He also noted that Total's shares were
yielding 4.2% on the basis of a share price of around 700
francs ($122.81), compared with 2.6% for the sample group.
   Mr. Tchuruk, who is also Total's chief executive officer,
said the group's 400 million tons of crude-oil reserves in
the Middle East will become an increasingly strategic asset,
as the region will become the key area for the international
oil market.
   He reaffirmed his belief that there is no future for the
petrochemical industry in countries that are oil importers.
But he said Total is studying possible partnerships in the
petrochemical field with concerns from oil producing
countries.

   Nixdorf Computer AG of West Germany posted a 1989 net loss
of about 1.07 billion marks ($623.5 million), compared with
year-earlier profit of 26.4 million marks after extraordinary
gains.
   The financially troubled computer concern, which is being
taken over by Siemens AG of West Germany, said its pretax
operating loss last year widened to 849 million marks from
59.8 million marks in 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 1989 net loss figure reflects unspecified charges to
account for the cost of Nixdorf's continuing corporate
overhaul, the company said. In 1988, the modest profit
included 152.8 million marks of extraordinary gains.
   Analysts had been anticipating a Nixdorf loss of as much
as one billion marks for 1989, which the company has
characterized as the worst year in its history.

   As a Broad Range of Issues Post Moderate Gains

   Tokyo stock prices finished higher with a broad range of
issues adding moderate gains on active buying by
corporations, individuals and dealers who traded for their
own accounts, analysts said.
   Meanwhile, stocks in London steadily lost ground in late
afternoon trading, with the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100 Share Index ending at the midway point of its intraday
range.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 239 points to
33192.50, finishing above 33000 points for the first time in
five trading days. The index gained 31.88 points Wednesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose
54.09 points to 33246.59.
   With help from some arbitrage buying, the Nikkei Index
moved at higher levels Thursday afternoon, before closing
just below its intraday high, traders said.
   Because Thursday was the last trading day for the June
stock futures and options, fears of a possible heavy sell-off
linked to the unwinding of the futures contract had
discouraged buying until yesterday.
   But growing confidence that the market can absorb such
futures-related selling prompted investors to buy stocks
without waiting for the special quotation today, when
settlement prices for the June futures and options are
determined, said Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of stock
trading at Nikko Securities.
   "That's because investors are expecting gains when
uncertainty {about the impact of unwinding of the futures} is
cleared," the analyst said.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 650 million
shares, up from 599.6 million shares Wednesday. Advancers
outnumbered decliners 567 to 372, while 185 issues were
unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which shed 1.86 points Wednesday, was up 5.37
points, or 0.22%, at 2428.44.
   The second section index advanced for the eighth
consecutive trading day, gaining 17.75 points, or 0.44%, to
4057.12. Volume was estimated at 24 million shares, down from
30.6 million shares Wednesday.
   "Fears of a vast sell-off were wiped out," said Masashi
Okuma, a senior trader at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International,
as arbitragers opted to roll over their positions held
against the June futures contract to the September contract.
   Analysts said the prevailing view on the market is that
stock prices will advance strongly today and in the first
half of next week if domestic interest rates and exchange
rates remain at current levels.
   One analyst said not many investors are willing to buy any
issue steadily, pushing its price higher. But investors place
buy orders whenever stock prices fall, gradually pushing up
the bottom of the Nikkei Index's range.
   Buying interest was spread over a wide range of sectors.
Volume failed to grow in the afternoon session, as
large-capital shares, which were the focus of morning trade
were replaced by small-capital shares, traders said.
   On the one hand, large-capital shares led by shipbuilding
stocks gained, partly supported by major brokerage houses'
efforts, traders said. Brokers were trying to make up profit
declines caused by lowered commission fees this month by
increasing trade volume, observers said.
   Buying interest, including that from institutions,
continued to stream toward small-capital shares with bright
earnings outlooks. Such interest wasn't limited to the Tokyo
Stock Exchange first and second sections, but was consistent
on over-the-counter trading, as well as on the Osaka and
Nagoya stock exchanges.
   Other issues that gained were laggards in sectors such as
mining, cement, machinery and automobiles.
   Winners included construction companies such as Kajima,
which gained 20 yen to 1980 yen (13 cents to $12.98), and
Kumagai Gumi, which added 50 yen to 1250 yen.
   Some car makers ended firmer, with Isuzu gaining 20 yen to
1110 yen, and Honda up 20 yen to 1810 yen.
   In London, traders said that the market was being pulled
in two directions, with London continuing to look undervalued
relative to other leading exchanges but being dictated to by
Wall Street's fortunes.
   "There's a lot of nervousness about Wall Street because
it's all over the place," said one market maker, referring to
Wall Street's recent erratic trading pattern.
   If Wall Street holds steady, London could easily breach
upside resistance levels, traders noted. With the recent
phenomenon of trade houses' running short positions largely
ended, the market is in a healthier position to scale new
heights, the traders added.
   A gain would be aided by an actual takeover bid. Current
takeover rumors are helping to shore up prices, but an actual
bid would swiftly add 30 points to the FTSE 100 index, the
traders reckon.
   The FT-SE 100 Share Index ended up 19.9 points yesterday
to 2378.4. The index initially fell, but the day's reversal
was largely attributed to bargain hunting by institutions
with considerable cash.
   The Financial Times 30 Share Index rose 23 points to 1904.
Volume was 592.5 million shares, compared with 429 million
issues Wednesday.
   In the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
ended at 2425, up from 2399 Wednesday.
   Banks issues suffered yesterday, running out of steam
after a recent run-up on speculation of a takeover. Lloyds
fell 6 pence to 291 pence (10 cents to $4.91), while Midland
shed 42 pence to 354 pence.
   Unilever's 7 pence loss to 698 pence was ascribed to
U.S.-led selling. Burton dropped 10 pence to 164 pence, as
the retail sector generally fell.
   Boots, which reported a rise in pretax profit for the year
to March 31 to #358 million from #306.7 million, eased after
an initial rally. The stock shed 2 pence to 296 pence.
Traders said the results were discounted in the share price,
which rose earlier in the week. In addition, the company's
much-vaunted new heart drug won't likely yield profits for
several more years, traders said.
   Meanwhile, stocks closed higher in Milan and Brussels,
lower in Stockholm, Frankfurt, Zurich and Madrid, and mixed
in Paris and Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed
sharply lower.
   Elsewhere, shares ended higher in Manila and Singapore,
and lower in Sydney, Taipei, Hong Kong, Seoul and Wellington.

   NEW YORK -- Reports on monetary policy in Switzerland and
Australia sparked traders' interest against a background of
mixed U.S. dollar dealings.
   The Swiss franc fell against the dollar and other
currencies on a news-service dispatch, later termed
misleading, about comments made Wednesday by Swiss National
Bank Chairman Markus Lusser in San Francisco. The market took
the report as a sign that the central bank might soon ease
its tight monetary policy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, a comment by Australian Treasurer Paul Keating
that the nation's monetary policy would stay tight drove the
Australian dollar higher.
   In other activity, the U.S. dollar extended its gradual
rise against the mark, but slipped slightly against the yen.
U.S. dollar dealings were characterized by participants as
slow, amid a general dearth of news on which to trade.
   But the U.S. currency leapt against its Swiss counterpart
after traders seized on the news-service report. The report
appeared to signal a change in tone by Mr. Lusser, who in the
past has vowed to do whatever is necessary to maintain the
strength of the franc, meaning in practice a policy of
relatively high interest rates.
   But a central bank official later termed the report
misleading, and added that the bank hasn't any intention of
easing policy soon. The bank raised its Lombard rate to
10.875% from 10.75%.
   In Australia, Mr. Keating said the continued tight grip on
money is needed to prevent a rebound in spending. He said it
will be some time before policy can be relaxed, because the
country's inflation and current account deficit are too high.
   In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at
1.6935 marks, up from 1.6885 marks late Wednesday, and at
152.55 yen, down from 152.65 yen. Sterling was at $1.6890, up
from $1.6875.
   The dollar was at 1.4445 Swiss francs, up from 1.4360
francs late Wednesday. The Australian dollar was at 77.75
U.S. cents, up from 77.23 U.S. cents.
   In Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading at 152.55 yen soon
after opening at 152.58 yen; it closed in Tokyo Thursday at
152.55 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.6925 marks, up from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.6884 marks.
   In other dealings, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen
against its West German counterpart, which has been weakening
in past days on nervousness about labor unrest in East
Germany.
   A nationwide strike by retail, restaurant and other
workers at small, independent businesses has been called for
today. They are protesting terms of the planned integration
of the two Germanys July 2, which employers' groups have said
would result in the near-term loss of as many as 350,000
jobs.
   In Europe, the U.S. dollar was mostly firmer, although the
currency continues trading in well-established bands. In
Tokyo, the U.S. dollar was narrowly mixed in thin trading.
   Separately, U.S. monetary authorities sold $1.78 billion
for yen and marks in the three months ended April 30,
according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   While the level of intervention was greater than the $750
million sold for yen in the November-January period, it was
small relative to other recent periods, and mainly was
intended to moderate the dollar's rise against the yen, the
Fed said. In the May-July quarter of 1989, the U.S. sold a
record $11.92 billion.
   For the year ended Jan. 31, the Fed spent approximately
$21 billion in intervention operations, according to Sam Y.
Cross, executive vice president of the New York Fed in charge
of its foreign group, who presented the Fed's quarterly
foreign-exchange report to Congress.
   The Fed sold $1.58 billion to buy yen during the most
recent period, and $200 million to buy marks, often in
concert with the central banks of other Group of Seven
industrial nations, Mr. Cross said. G-7 nations include the
U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada.
   Mr. Cross said the Fed didn't intervene against any other
currencies in the period. The Fed does, however, occasionally
act as agent for other central banks.
   The dollar rose 10% against the yen and fell less than
0.5% against the mark on balance during the period, Mr. Cross
said.
   The Fed didn't comment on any current activities in the
currency market.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery fell $2.80, to $354.60 an ounce. Estimated volume
was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $354.25 an ounce.

   Calgene Inc., an agricultural biotechnology concern based
in Davis, Calif., said it will incur a "significant" one-time
charge in its third quarter ending June 30, citing layoffs
and severance payments, and a greenhouse closure in
consolidating sites.
   A spokesman said an estimate of the charge wasn't
available. In the year-earlier quarter, Calgene had a net
loss of $1.7 million, on revenue of $8.1 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Calgene also said that this year, it will change its Sept.
30 fiscal year end to June 30, a time of seasonally low
activity in agriculture, when accounting relating to
inventory and other factors is easier and less expensive than
in September.
   Calgene said it has stopped development programs in
genetic engineering of certain plant hybrids and of alfalfa,
and laid off 35 employees, or about 11% of the total work
force, from those programs last week. These moves and the
closure of one of Calgene's three greenhouse operations are
aimed at focusing the company on its core projects of oils
modification, development of cotton that isn't damaged by
herbicide, and creation of improved-quality tomatos. Calgene
said the actions will reduce expenses by at least $3 million
annually.

   Panel Rejects
   Drexel Proposal
   To Reorganize

   NEW YORK -- The creditors' committee of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc. rejected the company's reorganization
proposal and said it will ask the bankruptcy court to let it
take the lead in coming up with a workable plan.
   The committee said its proposal will call for the ouster
of Drexel's board and management. In an unusual arrangement,
the plan also will set up an independent trust responsible
for going after the $260 million in bonuses that Drexel paid
its executives just weeks before filing for bankruptcy-law
protection. Recovery of the bonuses, however, would only be
sought if the sale of assets doesn't bring in enough money to
pay creditors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The creditors' committee is proposing that it and other
groups representing shareholders and subsidiaries' creditors
organize a search committee to find a new chairman for
Drexel.
   The committee voted unanimously to reject Drexel's
preliminary proposal, which was unveiled Wednesday. While
Drexel's proposal was light on specifics, the creditors'
committee will file "a detailed plan, a full-blown plan" with
the court on Monday, said Wilbur Ross, senior managing
director of Rothschild Inc., the committee's financial
adviser.
   The plan will be filed along with a motion asking federal
bankruptcy court Judge Howard Buschman III not to extend the
time period during which only Drexel can officially propose a
reorganization plan under Chapter 11. Drexel hasn't yet filed
a plan with the court and has said its preliminary proposal
earlier this week merely meant the negotiations of a plan
were under way.
   "The committee was quite unhappy with essential elements
of the Drexel plan," said Mr. Ross.
   A Drexel spokesman said, "The proper forum for discussing
these issues is in the court, and there is a hearing set for
Tuesday at which they will be discussed." The hearing will be
in Judge Buschman's chambers in federal bankruptcy court in
New York.
   Similar to Drexel's proposal, the committee's plan calls
for issuing securities backed by the company's assets,
estimated at about $2 billion. The notes, with maturities
staggered over three years, would be paid off as assets are
liquidated, Mr. Ross said. Unlike Drexel's plan, the
securities could be publicly traded immediately, Mr. Ross
said -- rather than having to be held for 30 months.
   Some creditors would be paid cash immediately, depending
on how much money is available when the reorganization plan
is confirmed. Mr. Ross said all creditors would be paid
securities or cash for 100% of the amount owed.
   If the liquidation of assets doesn't bring in enough money
to pay creditors, then the bonus payments would be targeted.
Under the creditors' proposal a separate trust would be
formed to pursue litigation to recover the bonuses, Mr. Ross

   U.K. Firm Says It Entered

   Coloroll Group PLC said it went into receivership after
the company was unable to arrange a refinancing strategy with
Candover Investments PLC, a venture capital group.
   Coloroll, a U.K. home fashion and home products concern,
has been involved in talks with Candover since May. Coloroll
issued a strong profit warning in January, as returns from
various operations waned in the wake of a downturn in the
U.K. housing market and consumer spending.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, the appointed receiver, and
Coloroll weren't available to comment.
   Financial problems have dogged Coloroll for several
months, as the group's ratio of debt to equity rose following
the purchase of John Crowther Group PLC, a British cloth and
carpets maker, in a stock swap for #215 million ($363
million).
   Coloroll planned to sell off several Crowther units, but
they became less attractive as U.K. interest rates rose
before the sales could be put into effect.
   For the six months to Sept. 30, Coloroll reported a 50%
drop in pretax profit to #10.1 million.

   New York State Finds Strong Investor Demand
   For Its $4.1 Billion Short-Term Spring Borrowing

   NEW YORK -- New York state drew strong investor demand for
$4.1 billion of short-term notes at its long-awaited spring
borrowing.
   An official at lead underwriter Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. said the offering was oversubscribed and that yields
were lowered from original levels.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We have orders for about $5.5 billion, with a good degree
of institutional participation as well as retail," said Frank
Murphy, senior vice president and head of the short-term
municipal desk at Shearson.
   The spring borrowing -- traditionally the largest bond
offering each year in most states -- was priced early to
6.15%. But later in the day, yields on the nine-month notes
were cut to 6.10%. The notes, which are used to finance the
state's huge accumulated deficit, mature on March 28, 1991.
   The yield on the notes was lower than the 6.20% to 6.35%
that had been talked about earlier this week.
   The thinking had been that the state couldn't sell the
spring borrowing at a lower rate than 6.20%, given that
credit rating agencies recently downgraded the state's credit
rating.
   The tax and revenue anticipation notes, which were priced
by a group led by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., was rated
MIG-2, the second-highest short-term municipal rating from
Moody's Investors Service. Last year's spring borrowing
carried top ratings.
   Late Wednesday, underwriting officials had agreed that the
deal should be priced to yield 6.20%, but the yield was
lowered when New York State Comptroller Edward Regan said he
wanted a lower rate, according to underwriting officials at
several members of the selling group.
   "We negotiated aggressively," said Bob Hinckley, a
spokesman for Mr. Regan when asked if the comptroller had
urged that underwriting officials offer the notes at the
lower yield level. The 0.10 percentage point reduction from
estimates will save the state about $3 million in interest
costs over the life of the notes.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Treasury bonds were unchanged to 1/8 point higher after
prices inched up in response to news that consumer credit
expanded much less than expected in April.
   The Federal Reserve reported that consumer credit grew
$584 million in April, much lower than expected.
   Trading was extremely quiet yesterday.
   The benchmark 30-year bond rose more than 1/8 point, or
$1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's
yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price,
fell to 8.42% from 8.44%.
   The price of the benchmark bond was quoted late at 103
14/32, up from 103 9/ 32.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   Investors continued to bid up junk bond prices.
   Most junk bonds, speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, climbed between
1/4 point and 1/2 point.
   Traders said that bonds from Duracell Holdings Corp.,
Kroger Co. and American Standard Inc. were among the
so-called high-quality junk bond names that advanced
yesterday.
   Duracell Holdings' 13.50% subordinated debentures,
maturing in 2000, were bid for at 104, up 1/2 point from
Wednesday, while Kroger's 13 1/8% subordinated debentures,
maturing in 2001, closed at 104, also up 1/2 point.
   Junk bonds of Trump Taj Mahal Funding slipped after news
that the number of employees at the Trump Taj Mahal gambling
resort is expected to decline to 6,200 from 7,100.
   Trump Taj Mahal Funding's 14% bonds, maturing in 1998,
closed at their session lows, sliding 3/4 point to 56 1/2.
The bonds had traded as high as 59 earlier in the session.
   By comparison, bonds of Trump Plaza Funding and Trump
Castle Funding showed little change.
   In the investment-grade debt market, actively traded
corporate issues were unchanged to slightly higher.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Retracing marginal gains posted earlier in the session,
municipals ended flat to 1/8 point higher in lackluster
dealings.
   Aside from the $4.1 billion New York state issue, trading
among secondary issues was slim.
   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 were unchanged, at 98 5/8 to yield
7.32%.
   No large municipal issues are expected to be priced today.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   A growing number of Japanese corporations are tapping the
commercial-paper market, or short-term corporate IOUs, a
trend that is expected to continue as other methods of
financing become scarce.
   Analysts estimate that outstanding commercial paper at the
end of April, the most recent figures available, totaled 15
trillion yen ($98.33 billion), up two trillion yen from
March. Japan's Finance Ministry first allowed companies to
issue commercial paper in November 1987.
   But the growth of new issuance was slow until the Tokyo
stock market dropped sharply earlier this year. Since then,
stock and equity-linked debt offerings have nearly
disappeared. Tighter restrictions on lending have made it
more difficult for companies to get bank loans. As a result,
more companies are turning to the commercial-paper market.
   Mitsubishi Motors Corp., the third-largest Japanese auto
maker, for example, obtained a commercial-paper rating at the
end of May that will allow it to issue as much as 200 billion
yen of paper.
   Shinichi Korechika, assistant manager of the planning and
funding group of Mitsubishi's finance department, said his
company has never issued commercial paper in the past, but
plans to in the near future.
   Officials at Japanese rating agencies said there has been
a rise in companies obtaining commercial-paper credit
ratings. The Japanese government will soon require all
companies that sell commercial paper to first obtain a credit
rating. Nippon Investors Service said it rated 41 companies
for commercial paper, including 15 since late March.
   In trading yesterday, Japanese government bonds ended
weaker on growing speculation that short-term interest rates
will keep their present high level. Japan's benchmark 10-year
issue ended at 87.97, down 0.07 point, to yield 6.975%. (The
yield is calculated in local terms, but would be lower if
calculated by the semiannual compound measure that is used in
the U.S.)
   In Britain, bond prices were buoyed by a rise in the pound
and a business survey pointing to moderate retail-sales
growth in May. Among benchmarks, Britain's 11.75% bond due
2003/2007 rose 10/32 to 100 1/2 to yield 11.68%.
   West German government bonds ended as much as 1/2 point
lower, pressured by technical trading in the futures pit.
Traders in the cash market said that while prices fell,
trading activity was very thin. Bonn's 8.75% bonds due in
2000 were quoted late at 99.60 to yield 8.82%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities crept up in response
to small gains in U.S. Treasurys.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
for June delivery advanced 1/32 to 99 10/32.
   In other mortgage sectors, Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. 9.5% securities were up 1/32 at 98 22/32; 10%
securities were 2/32 firmer at 100 19/32. Federal National
Mortgage Association 9.5% securities rose 1/32 to 99 6/32;
10% securities firmed 2/32 to 101 1/8.

   SOUTH AFRICA LIFTED its state of emergency in most of the
country.
   Hoping that the international community will move to end
economic sanctions, President de Klerk announced the repeal
of an array of regulations that gave the government and
police extraordinary powers to curb political dissent through
bannings, detention without trial and press censorship. But
de Klerk said the four-year-old emergency will remain in
effect in Natal province, where violence between rival black
groups is common. It was the latest in a series of moves to
normalize the country's political situation, and was hailed
by Mandela and other apartheid foes.

   Pilkington PLC said its pretax profit for the year to
March 31 fell 3.4%, as higher interest costs and reduced
investment income offset a slight gain in its big glassmaking
business.
   Pretax profit was #314 million ($186.1 million), down from
#325 million a year earlier. Profit after taxes dropped 7.6%
to #186 million from #201 million, while earnings per share
eased 8.4% to 25 pence from 27.3 pence.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Net profit attributable to shareholders managed a slim
1.2% rise to #179 million from #176 million. The group took
an extraordinary charge of #6.9 million, chiefly the result
of a provision against the effect of hyperinflation on its
Argentinian operations. The charge was down from the #24.4
million extraordinary loss a year earlier.
   Chairman Antony Pilkington said the "economic climate in a
number of the markets in which the group operates is more
uncertain today than has been the case for some time."
However, the group said it would still recommend a final
dividend of 7.57 pence a share that would increase the total
payout for the year to 10.5 pence from 9.5 pence.

   Greenwald Receives Lucrative Package
   To Spearhead UAL Buy-Out Effort

   Gerald Greenwald, who left the No. 2 job at Chrysler Corp.
to lead the proposed employee buy-out of United Airlines,
will be paid at least $9 million under terms of his
employment contract, even if the buyout effort fails.
   Mr. Greenwald, who quit as Chrysler's vice chairman last
week, received a $5 million bonus for signing on with the
buyout group, according to people familiar with his
compensation. He will receive an additional $4 million fee
even if the takeover isn't completed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The big payments are part of a five-year contract Mr.
Greenwald negotiated with United Airline's three unions
before agreeing last Wednesday to spearhead their takeover
effort. Under that agreement, the 54-year-old executive began
earning a $1.2 million annual salary the day the contract was
signed.
   If the transaction is completed, Mr. Greenwald will
receive a "success fee" of $1.2 million in addition to his
regular salary in the first year of the contract.
   Mr. Greenwald, who is slated to become UAL's chairman if
the employees take control, was in a strong bargaining
position since there is no guarantee the buy-out will
succeed. The unions had sought to keep terms of the agreement
secret. However, details of the pay package began to emerge
as the effort enters a critical stage.
   Mr. Greenwald and the unions' advisers are about to the
begin formal discussions with banks over financing for the
$4.38 billion so that they can meet a financing deadline of
Aug. 9. The buy-out group is also in the last stages of
negotiations with United's nonunionized employees whose
support is considered critical to the effort.
   The unions have proposed that the noncontract employees
contribute as much as $55 million in annual wage concessions
to fund the buy-out.
   Some employees are raising questions about Mr. Greenwald's
level of compensation, especially since workers will have to
take wage cuts to provide "sweat equity" for the buy-out.
However, one leader of the nonunionized employees called Mr.
Greenwald's deal "no worse than what goes on in baseball."
   Spokesmen for United's three unions declined to comment on
Mr. Greenwald's contract. Mr. Greenwald couldn't be reached,
but has declined in the past to discuss his compensation.
   Union officials have indicated previously that the
financial package was structured to compensate for potential
income and benefits Mr. Greenwald was giving up at Chrysler,
where he was in line to succeed Chairman Lee A. Iacocca. They
note than UAL paid current Chairman Stephen M. Wolf a $6.7
million bonus to take the job three years ago.
   One union adviser characterized as "perfectly natural" the
portion of the agreement guaranteeing Mr. Greenwald a fee if
the transaction fails.
   At Chrysler, Mr. Greenwald received an annual salary of
$1.1 million. According to 1990 proxy materials, he held
47,647 Chrysler shares and had options to buy $21,625 more at
prices ranging from $13.98 to $25.88. Chrysler stock closed
at $16.125 yesterday in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   The UAL agreement also provides Mr. Greenwald with stock
in the airline. It couldn't be determined how big of a stake
Mr. Greenwald would receive. As currently contemplated, the
employees would own 100% of United Airlines if the buy-out
succeeds.
   Discussions with the nonunionized employees are expected
to come to a head within the next few days. The buy-out is
structured so that it could proceed without the participation
of the 26,000 non-contract employees. But it would hurt the
buy-out group if dissent among the ranks surfaced during
financing negotiations with the banks.
   The buy-out group is also close to finalizing a proposed
slate of directors should the buy-out succeed. The unions
asked Spencer Stuart Associates, an executive search firm, to
recommend eight outside directors for the 15-member board.
   The unions want to have a slate of directors in hand in
order to convince banks that Mr. Greenwald and the board, not
the unions, will govern the company. One official familiar
with the deliberations said the unions want to keep some
current UAL directors, believing that will enhance their
chances with the banks.
   Mr. Greenwald and three union representatives will also
sit on the board.

   Barry Blau &amp; Partners
   To Restate Its Results
   For Certain Past Years

   FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- Barry Blau &amp; Partners Inc., a direct
response advertising agency, said it will restate its
financial results for certain prior years as a result of "an
understanding" with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The adjustments, of an unspecified amount, involve
deferred compensation aspects of a 1984 employment agreement
with Barry Blau, the company's chief executive officer. In
addition, the company will accelerate in prior years the
write-off of certain deferred costs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said the restatement won't "materially affect"
stockholders' equity as of March 31. The company said the
vested portion of the deferred compensation agreement has
been waived by Mr. Blau and has been contributed back into
the company as capital; the other deferred costs had been
treated as expense as of March 31.
   Fred Kaseff, chief financial officer, said the restatement
would include the financial results for the nine months ended
March 31, when the company reported net income of $69,839 or
4 cents a share, on revenue of $45.4 million.
   The company also said that, apart from the accounting
issues, it anticipates that over the near term, earnings will
suffer "due to budget reductions and program cutbacks at
certain clients." Mr. Kaseff declined to elaborate.
   The company has been reviewing a number of accounting
issues raised by its former accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand in
the 10-Q report for the three months ended Dec. 31. At that
time, the accounting firm said it believed certain prior-year
results should be restated, and that its report on the fiscal
year ended last June 30 shouldn't be relied upon.
   Subsequently, the company's board hired accounting firm
BDO Seidman to analyze the accounting issues. The company
said it decided to restate its figures on the basis of
consultations between the company, BDO Seidman and the SEC
staff.

   Work to Salvage
   Anti-Crime Bill

CONGRESS (CNG)

   WASHINGTON -- Democratic and Republican leaders in the
Senate said they will continue efforts to salvage an omnibus
anti-crime bill, after a second attempt to limit debate on
the wide-ranging legislation failed.
   After private negotiations last night, proponents of the
bill said they will try to preserve for a future vote
provisions already fiercely debated on the Senate floor,
including a three-year ban on nine types of semi-automatic
"assault" weapons, expansion of the federal death penalty,
and sharp curbs on constitutional appeals by death-row
inmates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But George Mitchell, the majority leader, and Robert Dole,
the minority leader, emerged from the closed-door session to
report that they didn't have an agreement. Democrats, Mr.
Mitchell said, "will review and take a look at" a Republican
proposal to avoid a filibuster that has threatened to kill
the entire bill.
   Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden, who is managing the
legislation for the Democrats, sounded more optimistic in a
separate press conference. Calling the Republican proposal "a
serious effort," he said, "my gut tells me something will
break and we will get a bill."
   Among other things, the GOP proposed to strip a measure
that would allow criminal juries in certain instances to
consider unconstitutionally gathered evidence. Mr. Biden
predicted there would be several days of negotiations before
any further votes.
   Earlier yesterday, Democratic proponents of the bill had
pronounced it dead after the Senate failed for a second time
to limit debate on the legislation. The second vote in favor
of a 30-hour debate limit was 57-37, but 60 votes are needed
under Senate rules.
   With some 300 amendments pending at that point, debate
could have dragged on indefinitely. Mr. Mitchell had said
that without a time limit, he would be forced to end
consideration of the bill. That outcome is exactly what
opponents of the gun-control provision, led by the National
Rifle Association, had sought in helping orchestrate the
avalanche of amendments.
   But South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond led a Republican
effort to save some portion of the crime legislation. In a
private caucus, GOP leaders agreed to propose to Democrats
that each party be allowed to propose a maximum of 12
amendments to the current version of the bill, with a
predetermined time limit on debate, Republican aides said.
   Another set of noncontroversial amendments might also be
added under the Republican plan, aides said. GOP leaders
proposed that the Senate drop consideration of a Biden
proposal to allow certain exceptions to the so-called
exclusionary rule, which bars the use of unconstitutionally
gathered evidence in criminal prosecutions. Republicans have
advocated even broader exceptions to the rule, and the issue
was sure to provoke sharp conflict.
   In his news conference, Mr. Biden indicated a willingness
to consider eliminating the exclusionary-rule provision, as
well as his proposal to create a new division for drugs and
organized crime within the Justice Department.

   BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS -- A federal bankruptcy judge approved
a series of measures that allow Greyhound Lines Inc. to keep
its buses on the road for the start of the summer travel
season.
   Judge Richard S. Schmidt said he would permit Greyhound to
pay salaries and operating expenses until June 28, when he
scheduled another hearing to discuss the matter. He also
permitted the company to release $2 million in pre-filing COD
payments from package-express customers and to honor charter
bus deposits made before Monday, when Greyhound and five
other units of GLI Holding Co. filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This enables us to get on with business as usual,"
Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said of the decisions.
   But the proceedings also set the stage for continued
wrangling between Greyhound and the Amalgamated Transit
Union, which has waged a three-month-long strike against the
company. Among the $29.5 million in pay, benefits and
workers' compensation claims to be honored were $2.5 million
in paychecks issued, but not cleared before the Chapter 11
filing. In a move affecting top Greyhound executives, ATU
attorneys successfully negotiated a $2,000-per-employee cap
on honoring those checks.
   Before the hearing, Greyhound withdrew a tender offer it
made two weeks ago to redeem about $191 million in face
amount of debt for about $86 million in cash. J. Michael
Doyle, senior vice president and chief financial officer,
said the action was taken "so that we can focus on mapping
out a sound debt restructuring plan for the court."

   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Edward Tracy, the president of
Donald Trump's Atlantic City holdings, said none of the
beleaguered casino owner's three casinos are for sale.
   Mr. Tracy tried to allay concerns that Mr. Trump's casino
properties were not doing well, and predicted they would
produce "an avalanche of cash" this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since the Taj Mahal opened in April, revenue at Trump
Plaza and Trump's Castle has fallen, compared with a year
earlier. Revenue at the Taj Mahal has also fallen short of
expectations. But Mr. Tracy said reports of the Taj's revenue
results have been unfair because the reports failed to
account for about $16 million of non-casino income.
   Mr. Tracy said he expects as many as 1,100 additional
layoffs at the Taj. He said such layoffs were routine for a
new casino.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Trump named Gary Selesner president and
chief operating officer of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. Mr.
Selesner was previously acting president and chief operating
officer.

   LONDON -- Lloyd's of London Chairman Murray Lawrence said
he plans to step down at year end, and the insurance market's
ruling council nominated David Coleridge, a recent deputy
chairman, to succeed him.
   Approval for Mr. Coleridge's nomination is expected Dec. 5
at the first meeting of a newly elected Lloyd's council. If
cleared, he will take the helm at an important time. The more
than 300-year-old insurance exchange has been buffeted in
recent years by increasing competitive challenges and is
trying to increase its business and reduce costs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Lawrence, 55 years old, appears to be looking for a
change after serving on Lloyd's governing panel for 11 years,
the past 2 1/2 of them as chairman. "These have been years of
great change and achievement," he said. But, he added, now is
"an appropriate moment for a successor to take over the
reins." Mr. Lawrence will continue to head the Lloyd's
underwriting agency that bears his name, and will continue as
a member of the council for another year.
   Mr. Coleridge, 58, is considered a consumate Lloyd's
insider, having been a broker, underwriter and executive in
the market for more than 35 years. He currently is chairman
of Sturge Holdings PLC, one of Lloyd's largest underwriting
agents. He also has served on the ruling council for seven of
the past eight years, and was a deputy chairman until last
December.
   In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Coleridge declined to
discuss any plans for Lloyd's. But he said he "will really
try hard" in the post.

   NEC Corp. has developed a new siliconwafer etching
technology, taking a crucial step toward mass production of
64 megabit dynamic random access memory chips, the company
announced.
   The latest semiconductors to be mass produced are 4
megabit chips while 16-megabit chips are still in the
experimental stage.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A NEC spokesman said the new technology, called Super-ECR
Plasma Etching, makes it possible to quickly etch the tightly
packed, complicated structures necessary for the
next-generation chip.
   The spokesman said the new technology will first be
applied to the production of 16-megabit chips.
   NEC's newly developed technology, using plasma over the
silicon wafer, makes it possible to etch electric circuits at
high speed.
   Compared with previously developed plasma etching methods,
the new technology is faster, finer and causes less damage to
adjoining layers of wafer membrane, the spokesman said.

   DALLAS -- Laurence Vineyard Jr., a former Dallas lawyer
and onetime owner of a Colorado thrift, agreed to plead
guilty to a charge that he misapplied the proceeds of loan
from the defunct Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association of Dallas,
the Justice Deparment said.
   The charge, filed yesterday in federal court in Dallas,
involves a $12.7 million loan that Mr. Vineyard obtained from
Vernon Savings on the same day he was indicted for fraud in
connection with his ownership of Key Savings &amp; Loan
Association of Englewood, Colo.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Vineyard had financed his purchase of Key Savings with
a loan from Vernon and was to pay down a portion of that debt
with the new loan. Instead, according to the new criminal
charge, Mr. Vineyard drew $2.6 million on the loan and used
the money to purchase a $1.18 million mansion and to
establish trust funds for his children.
   Mr. Vineyard, 41 years old, currently is serving a
five-year prison term for his conviction on fraud charges
related to Key Savings. The new fraud charge carries a
maximum penalty of five years in federal prison and a fine of
up to twice the loss he caused to Vernon Savings.

   Valmont Industries Inc. said its second-quarter earnings
won't equal last year's second quarter, but will exceed the
$4.5 million, or 38 cents a share, it earned in the first
quarter.
   In the second quarter of 1989, the maker of irrigation

a share, on sales of $199.6 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Valmont of Valley, Neb., said its second-quarter
performance of 1990 is the result of sales in its irrigation
markets slowing sooner than expected. The lower activity was
due to an early spring planting season and abundant rainfalls
in irrigation markets, as well as the slowing of industrial
products sales in construction markets.
   The company said that, while its second-quarter earnings
will be lower than last year's, it expects earnings for 1990
will exceed the 1989 level of $20.7 million, or $1.78 a
share, on sales of $789.8 million.

   Sets Cease-Fire
   For Talks on Sale

   Pic 'N' Save Corp., which has waged a two-month dogfight
against takeover attempts by an investor group led by David
H. Batchelder, declared a temporary cease-fire to talk with
the group and others about a possible sale of the concern.
   Pic 'N' Save said it would postpone its annual meeting
until Aug. 15 from June 20. Meanwhile, Mr. Batchelder's
group, Girard Partners Limited Partnership, said it would
temporarily drop its proxy battle for control of Dominguez,
Calif.-based Pic 'N' Save.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company, which said it would accept takeover bids
until July 15, agreed with Girard that the partnership and
other potential bidders wouldn't be required to sign a
standstill pact precluding future proxy fights, as previously
stated, in order to make a bid. Pic 'N' Save, an operator of
a chain of retail stores specializing in new "close-out"
merchandise, stated that neither Girard nor Pic 'N' Save
would be allowed to solicit proxies prior to July 15.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Pic 'N' Save closed
at $12.375, down 12.5 cents, placing the market value of the
company at about $436.6 million.
   Mr. Batchelder, who said Girard hasn't as yet made any
offer and that he knows of no other bids, said he was hopeful
the agreement would negate the need for a proxy fight after
July 15.
   Pic 'N' Save's chairman and chief executive officer, Lewis
B. Merrifield III, said the pact would allow the company to
"concentrate all of our efforts on trying to maximize
shareholder value through a sale of the company and hope that
there will not be any need for further disputes with Girard."
   A news release hinted that there were other interested
parties, but a spokesman for the company declined to say if
any bids had been received.
   Girard has previously stated that if it succeeded in
efforts to gain control, it would buy the company or auction
it off to the highest bidder.
   The spat between the two concerns began when the
partnership controlled by Mr. Batchelder, a former strategist
for T. Boone Pickens, disclosed in April that it held a 6.6%
stake in Pic 'N' Save and planned to make a bid to acquire
it.
   Girard later formally asked the company for control of the
Pic 'N' Save board and launched a proxy fight to gain a
majority on the board.
   Meanwhile, Pic 'N' Save, struggling to keep control, put
itself up for sale in May and said its financial advisers
would begin calling a host of potential buyers. But it said
it would only provide non-public information to prospective
buyers who sign a confidentiality agreement with several
standstill provisions. If it wished to bid for the company,
Girard Partners would have been forced to abandon for three
years efforts to seize control of the board.
   Although Pic 'N' Save late last month offered the group
minority representation on its board and on a newly formed
committee to evaluate bids to buy the company, Girard
promptly rejected it.
   Pic 'N' Save said it would allow Girard to participate in
the auction and resume its solicitation of consents and
proxies for its board nominees after July 15, the new record
date for the annual meeting, if no bidder emerges. It also
agreed to reimburse Girard for out-of-pocket proxy fight
expenses and to drop pending litigation until after July 15.

   Real Estate Sales Keep
   Steam in Troubled Railroad

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS (REA)

<LP>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Soon after Philip Anschutz bought
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. in 1988, dozens of
employees gathered in the Utah desert to re-create railroad
history.
   As cameras clicked, the celebrants posed on facing diesel
locomotives from the Southern Pacific and from Mr. Anschutz's
smaller Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western. Recalling the 1869
"golden spike" ceremony on completion of the first
transcontinental railroad, the scene was meant to symbolize
Mr. Anschutz's plan to revive Southern Pacific as part of a
new railroad across the West.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Mr. Anschutz's Southern Pacific is hitting rough
track.
   Faced with deepening losses at the railroad and high debt
obligations, Mr. Anschutz is keeping the Southern Pacific
afloat with accelerated real estate sales. Shippers complain
of management confusion, erratic pricing tactics and delays
caused by worn-out locomotives.
   "A lot of people thought Anschutz coming aboard was like
Santa Claus coming down the chimney," says Rollin Bredenberg,
a Southern Pacific general manager. But combining the
railroad with Mr. Anschutz's smaller Denver &amp; Rio Grande
Western "hasn't solved any of the fundamental problems of the
Southern Pacific," he concedes.
   Others worry that Mr. Anschutz, a Denver owner of oil and
gas, real estate and Western art, doesn't know how to run a
railroad. Robert Starzel, a Southern Pacific vice chairman
and Anschutz confidant, says that railroading has proven
"difficult for us" but insists his boss will make the
railroad prosper.
   Although the Southern Pacific is the weakest of the
nation's seven major railroads and isn't publicly owned, its
health is of keen interest to shippers, consumers and
travelers. The railroad is the largest hauler of
international goods to the Midwest from Southern California
ports and its scenic routes are traversed by Amtrak passenger
trains.
   Mr. Anschutz and minority partner, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.,
acquired the company in a $1.02 billion leveraged buy-out
plus assumption of $780 million debt. The purchase was widely
hailed by Southern Pacific employees after a plan to merge
the railroad with Santa Fe Pacific Corp. was rejected by the
Interstate Commerce Commission in 1987.
   But hopes for fast rejuvenation of Southern Pacific have
faded. The company's rail operations had a loss of $66
million last year, reflecting a downturn in automobile and
lumber traffic, rate wars, a major accident and the cost of
adding new trains. Proceeds from property sales, however,
resulted in net income of $98 million.
   However, when real estate sales failed to cover the
company's burden of debt and capital spending, Southern
Pacific renegotiated terms of its loan with Bank of America
last December to avoid default. In April, Moody's Investors
Service downgraded $695 million of the company's long-term
debt, concluding that proceeds from real estate sales will
only partially offset the gap in cash from lower rail
operating earnings.
   The company's disappointing railroad performance has
shaken the confidence of some shippers. "I'm concerned that
they will become financially insolvent and the railroad will
be sold piecemeal," says Homer Bollard, general traffic
manager of Louisiana-Pacific Corp., a big lumber shipper.
   Southern Pacific officials dismiss such concerns. "This
isn't a question of bankruptcy. There are billions of dollars
of assets here," says Vice Chairman Starzel. Even if company
forecasts for profitable rail operations next year don't pan
out, Southern Pacific could support its railroad with
proceeds from real estate sales for years, Mr. Starzel says.
   Mr. Anschutz declines to give interviews. But he has told
shippers that his 15,000-mile rail franchise is among the
strongest, because it includes two major east-west routes and
track to most West and Gulf coast ports. To strengthen the
system, Mr. Anschutz bought a regional rail line last year,
giving Southern Pacific trains direct access to Chicago for
the first time. Now he is trying to overcome the objections
of competing railroads to buy a second route to Chicago.
Slight, restless and 50 years old, Mr. Anschutz likes to take
freight trains to meet crew members and entertain shippers
aboard the Anschutz family yacht.
   The Southern Pacific is struggling to regain ground lost
to competitors when it was held in trust for five years
pending its aborted merger with Santa Fe. While Southern
Pacific languished, larger rivals Union Pacific Corp. and
Burlington Northern Inc. moved aggressively to shed surplus
lines and employees and invest in modern technology.
   Without the heavy coal and grain traffic of Union Pacific
and Burlington Northern, the railroad is also highly
dependent upon cyclical and rate competitive shipments of
lumber, automobiles, chemicals and containerized freight.
   Mr. Anschutz also inherited the results of years of
lagging capital spending. Although Southern Pacific's main
lines have been upgraded, some of its yards are old and
poorly maintained. As he walks through Southern Pacific's
freight yard in Portland, Ore., trainmaster Robert Melbo is
summoned by radio to a two-car derailment caused by rotted
ties under the rails.
   Much of the company's locomotive fleet is old and
outmoded. And its freight cars for carrying lumber are
deplorable, says Dennis Williams, director of traffic and
distribution at Bohemia Inc., Eugene, Ore. "They have some
good cars but too few. The rest are old and inefficient."
   But some problems are of Mr. Anschutz's own making. He
built the railroad's management team with a president from
the Southern Pacific and a vice chairman from Denver &amp; Rio
Grande, even though the two railroads have conflicting
philosophies. While President D. Michael Mohan was steeped in
the Southern Pacific's costcutting ways, Vice Chairman
William Holtman learned at Denver &amp; Rio Grande to put a
premium on service. Southern Pacific executives say the
confusion is heightened because Mr. Holtman sometimes differs
with Mr. Mohan on important decisions.
   Last year Mr. Mohan tried to cut crew costs by ordering
that freight trains be combined. But after freight began to
back up in yards and customers complained of delayed
shipments, Mr. Holtman shortened train sizes. "We adopt a
strategy, and before it can produce results, we drop it and
try something else," says Mr. Melbo, the trainmaster, adding
that the company has changed its train-size requirements four
times in the past 18 months.
   Southern Pacific has won some freight lost to competitors
but often at such low rates that the railroad lost money
hauling the traffic. "In our zeal to sign up customers we
lost sight of the fact that you sign them up to make money,
not just to lure them away from someone else," says a former
Southern Pacific vice president.
   Now, the railroad's efforts to boost rates are straining
relationships with customers. "They had tremendous reductions
in rates to gain market share and then raised rates beyond
what the market will bear," says Philip Yeager, chairman of
Hub Group, a Chicago-based shippers' agent. "They have
bewildered the shipping public."
   Company officials say Mr. Anschutz sought to clear up
management confusion last fall by declaring Mr. Holtman head
of the railroad's day-to-day operations while putting Mr.
Mohan in charge of marketing and long-range strategy. Last
month Mr. Anschutz hired Don Orris, a former American
President Cos. executive who is highly regarded by shippers,
to give new direction to Southern Pacific's troubled
marketing and sales department.
   Some shippers see signs of improvements. American
President, a big container shipper, recently dropped threats
to abandon the Southern Pacific after the railroad boosted
on-time delivery of its shipments to 90% from 60%.
   Mr. Anschutz has won praise from rail labor. Glynn
Gallagher, a general chairman of the United Transportation
Union, says Mr. Anschutz improved relations between
management and labor by retiring a vice president who was
unpopular because of his harsh disciplinary tactics. "We're a
lot better off with Anschutz than we would have been any
other way," says Mr. Gallagher, who is supporting a plan to
sharply reduce crew sizes aboard Southern Pacific freight
trains in the West.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Anschutz tries to accelerate sales of real
estate that company officials value at close to $2 billion.
The company stunned long-time employees last month by
announcing that the company's San Francisco headquarters
building may be offered for sale. Southern Pacific is also
trying to peddle surplus lines in Los Angeles and San
Francisco to the state for rail transit corridors. When state
officials had trouble meeting the company's price for the
lines, Southern Pacific contributed $250,000 to an
environmental group that campaigned for new sources of
transit funding. Californians voted on and passed measures
Tuesday, which will provide $1.9 billion for state rail
projects.
   "Voters have said not only that they want these rail
corridors but that they are willing to pay for them and that
can mean a lot of money for us," Mr. Starzel said.

   MILAN, Italy -- The Italian subsidiary of U.S. food
company Kraft General Foods Inc. is to take a majority stake
in a new holding company being set up to control the Pietro
Negroni S.p.A. salami and cold meats group.
   Kraft General Foods is a unit of Philip Morris Cos.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The accord with Negroni strengthens Kraft's position in
the Italian market while giving the privately owned Negroni
group access to Kraft's financial and technological
resources, top executives of both companies said.
   Under the agreement, Kraft General Foods Italia S.p.A.
will take an approximately two-thirds stake in the new
holding company. (Kraft already has a 25% stake in Negroni.)
The Negroni family, which has been in the prepared-meats
business since 1907, will have a one-third stake in the new
company.
   "The aim is to create an Italian meat concern to compete
better internationally. . . . It is useful to combine forces
to develop the company," said Negroni Chairman Pietro
Negroni, noting that exports would be targeted particularly
at the European and North American markets. The new holding
company is likely to be called Negroni Holding '93.
   Kraft General Foods Italia Chairman Ernesto Fugazzola
would give no details of the cost to Kraft of the
transaction, but said that it had been calculated on the same
basis as other recent transactions in the sector. Despite its
minority stake, the Negroni family will have considerable
influence on the board of the new holding company, especially
concerning strategic investments.
   Mr. Fugazzola said the holding company could eventually be
listed on the Milan stock exchange, although there were no
plans at present for such a step.
   Kraft has been active in Italy for more than 25 years.
Last year, Kraft's Italian unit reported after-tax operating
profit of 77 billion lire ($62.2 million) on sales of 1.22
trillion lire. Employing close to 4,000 people, its main
products include mayonnaise, cheeses, prepared plates, tuna
and pasta.
   Negroni is considerably smaller, with after-tax operating
profit of 1.5 billion lire last year on sales of 140.6
billion lire, and around 800 employees. Its production,
concentrated in four sites around Parma and Cremona in
northern Italy, consists primarily of salami, ham, cold meats
and stuffed pasta.

   Rockwell Realigns
   Its Big Defense
   Electronics Sector

   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Rockwell International Corp., trying
to squeeze what it can from one of the only potential growth
areas left in the military budget, has realigned its
defense-electronics organization.
   The action won't affect the 16,000 employees in the
sector. But it streamlines the number of divisions that fall
under Rockwell's defense-electronics rubric to five from six,
and the number of individual operating segments to 14 from
17.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We're always looking for ways to bring like businesses
together, to build on each other," Kent Black, Rockwell's
executive vice president and chief operating officer, said in
an interview. He said the move was made not to save money per
se, but to allow the company to bid more effectively on
Pentagon contracts and overseas work.
   For example, the segment that makes missile-guidance
equipment will be combined with the shop that designs
navigational gear for submarines, allowing the two to share
similar ideas and technologies. Likewise, units that deal
heavily with computer software will unite.
   The push to regroup defense-electronics apparently was
heightened by several recent contract awards. "It's created
pressure to rationalize some of these things," Mr. Black
said. Among the wins: exclusive production of the Hellfire
missile, which had been shared with Martin Marietta Corp.;
the manufacture of parts for the MX and Midgetman missiles,
which had been handled primarily by Northrop Corp.; and the
integration of a combat system for the Australian navy's new
submarine program.
   Mr. Black also said the company has been notified that it
beat out General Dynamics Corp. for a $150 million pact to
upgrade the avionics on F-111 aircraft for the Australian
government, though the contract award hasn't been officially
announced.
   Rockwell's efforts in the defense-electronics realm mirror
those under way throughout the industry. Electronics is one
of the few parts of the Defense Department budget that might
grow through the mid-1990s, because even if new aircraft,
armored vehicles and ships aren't built, the insides of the
older models will have to be retrofitted.
   As a result, competition is heating up. "A lot of
companies are trying to eliminate their redundancies," said
Chuck Quinn, a marketing executive with United Research, a
consulting firm that works closely with aerospace concerns.
Abeyance, he said, will spell doom.
   Mr. Black said he thinks that Rockwell's
defense-electronics group, which now accounts for about 15%
of the diversified parent corporation's $12.52 billion in
total revenue, could expand slightly in the next few years.

   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. -- General Cinema Corp. reported a
97% drop in fiscal second-quarter net income, chiefly because
of a gain in the year-earlier period from discontinued
operations.
   The operator of cinemas and specialty retailer said net
for the quarter ended April 30 fell to $29.8 million, or 40
cents a share, from $893.9 million, or $12.10 a share, in the
year-ago period.

profit of $859 million from discontinued operations, which
included $855.1 million from the disposal of operations.
Profit from continuing operations was $34.9 million, or 47
cents a share, a year ago.
   Revenue rose 20% to $642.8 million from $536.9 million.
   In the first six months, net fell 95% to $49.9 million, or
68 cents a share, from $938.3 million, or $12.71 a share, in
the year-ago period.
   The latest period included a pretax loss of $586,000 from
the sale of securities. A year ago, the company had a pretax
gain of $82.9 million from the sale of securities, and profit
from continuing operations of $72.4 million, or 98 cents a
share.
   Revenue was $1.16 billion, up 19% from $976.6 million.
   The company did not predict results for the third quarter,
but said it is unlikely its theater division's earnings will
exceed the $12.2 million earned in the past year's summer
quarter.

   The prototype, which Hitachi says is the world's first,
has 16 times the memory capacity than the four megabit DRAMs
that are the largest capacity chips in mass production today.
The next largest chips, with capacity of 16 megabits, are
still in the experimental stage.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hitachi officials said the prototype consumes
approximately one-tenth the electricity required by the
16-megabit DRAMs the company unveiled recently, suggesting a
new step toward miniaturization of products such as laptop
computers.
   The prototype is capable of operating on a 1.5-volt
battery cell, because of the use of dense packing technology.
   An industry analyst said the timing of the announcement
"isn't a mystery," considering the speed with which Japanese
semiconductor makers are developing advanced chips.
   The Japanese industry also is working to develop advanced
mass-production techniques, he noted, adding he expects
Hitachi to begin producing the chips by 1996. Hitachi said it
didn't know when mass production would begin.

   PPG Industries Inc. said it agreed in principle to form a
joint venture with France's Essilor International to make
plastic lenses for consumer eyeglasses.
   PPG said it would own 51% of the new company, which would
be based in St. Petersburg, Fla. The agreement, which has
been approved by Essilor's board, must be approved by PPG
directors. Terms of the venture weren't disclosed.

   The new firm would make the plastic lenses, which darken
when exposed to bright light. The product would be sold
exclusively to lens casters for ultimate distribution to
consumers. PPG said such lenses have been available only in
glass.
   PPG said the venture is part of the company's strategy to
generate 40% of total chemicals revenue from specialty
products by 1994. The Pittsburgh maker of glass, chemicals
and coatings said it has invested more than $10 million to
research and develop the new plastic lens, which has been
test marketed under the Transitions trademark since July.
Mass U.S. distribution is planned for 1991, with
international sales expected to begin in 1992.

   April Consumer Debt Grew
   At Annual Rate of Just 1%

   WASHINGTON -- Consumer debt barely grew in April, weighed
down mainly by a plunge in car loans, the Federal Reserve
said.
   Consumer installment credit outstanding -- generally all
forms of personal debt but mortgages -- grew a scant $584
million in April, amounting to an annual growth rate of 1%,
the Fed said. That followed annual growth rates of 4% in
March and 0.1% in February, both far smaller than most gains
last year and weaker than many economists had predicted.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Consumer credit has expanded at a faint pace all year.
Many economists say the slowdown mainly reflects a new
caution among consumers in response to uncertain economic
conditions.
   "Consumer spending had held up pretty well through the
first quarter, but it has begun to weaken a bit, as has the
job market and income gains," said Sandra Shaber, an
economist for the Futures Group. "So we can't take consumer
spending as much for granted as we had." She noted that the
expansion of consumer debt has slipped behind personal-income
gains during the past six months.
   Automobile loans, which fell in two of the past three
months, tumbled at a 10.3% annual rate during the month, a
drop of $2.5 billion. But revolving credit, which includes
mostly short-term debt such as credit-card and bank-card
borrowing, shot up $2.4 billion, or at a 14% annual rate.
   The numbers were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.
Without adjusting, consumer installment credit outstanding
stood at $715.82 billion at the end of April, up 4.3% from a
year earlier.

   Colombia must urgently increase its foreign trade to
create jobs for people now dependent on narcotics traffic for
their livelihood, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
said.
   The country has made great progress in diversifying its
exports following a sharp decline in the price of coffee in
recent years, said a GATT review of trade policies in South
America. But the Geneva-based body, which sets rules for most
world commerce, added, "Further trade expansion is crucial
for Colombia."
   Colombia has increased its sales of coal, petroleum,
bananas, cut flowers, clothing and leather goods, said the
GATT report. But it said Colombia faces difficulties in major
export markets. It cited as an example U.S. anti-dumping
duties that almost doubled tariffs on Colombian carnations
and chrysanthemums.
   An unrelated report by two Colombian research groups noted
that murders in Colombia increased to 23,312 in 1989 from
9,122 in 1980 and said that nearly half of last year's
killings were probably linked to drug trafficking.
                                                                                                       

   ALGERIAN GAS FOR EUROPE
                                                                                                       

   Algeria will become the European Community's main supplier
of natural gas once a planned pipeline is completed, the
senior vice president of West Germany's Ruhrgas AG, Gerhard
Enseling, was quoted as saying in a report by the OPEC News
Agency. Mr. Enseling reportedly told an energy seminar in
Morocco that the EC had a long-term requirement of up to 45
billion cubic meters of natural gas annually. The seminar was
told that Algeria ultimately planned to transport as much as
17 billion cubic meters of gas a year through the pipeline,
which would pass through Morocco across the strait of
Gibraltar to Portugal.
                                                                                                       

   KENYA MAY LIFT A HUNTING BAN
                                                                                                       

   Kenya is considering lifting its current ban on wildlife
shooting. But Richard Leakey, the country's leading
conservationist, stressed that no big game or endangered
species would come under fire. "Certainly no elephants, no
rhino, no endangered species," said Mr. Leakey, who is
director of Kenya's Wildlife Department; instead, any
shooting would be a controlled effort to kill some plains
species that have runaway populations.
                                                                                                       

   THE EC AND WASTE
                                                                                                       

   European Community environment ministers agreed to tighten
controls on the production, transport and disposal of waste.
The measure approved by the ministers calls for the EC to
dispose of waste within its own borders, which would end the
much-criticized practice of sending waste to countries in the
Third World or in Eastern Europe. The ministers also said
member states should aim for "self-sufficiency" in waste
disposal to reduce the transport of waste around Europe.
                                                                                                       

   VISAS FOR ISRAEL
                                                                                                       

   More than a million Soviet Jews have received Israeli
immigration visas, according to the semi-official agency in
Israel that tracks such data. The agency said 1,163,350 Jews
held entry visas but were awaiting Soviet permission to
leave. Arabs opposing the immigration say they fear Israel
will settle the arrivals in the occupied territories, home to
1.75 million Palestinians, which Israel captured from Jordan
and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. A spokeswoman said
Israel was processing 1,500 entrance visas daily.
                                                                                                       

   `MAD COW' COMPROMISE
                                                                                                       

   European Community agriculture ministers agreed on tighter
measures to curb "mad cow" disease, and France, West Germany
and Italy agreed to lift bans on British beef imports.
   After an all-night emergency meeting, British Agriculture
Minister John Gummer said the bans would be lifted by
midnight last night. The bans were imposed because of concern
that the cattle brain disease, which has afflicted British
herds, affects human health.
   The basis of the agreement is that beef from herds where
the disease -- bovine spongiform encephalopathy -- was
confirmed could not be exported. Live cattle can be exported
only if they are younger than six months and are certified
not to be the offspring of a cow suspected of having the
virus.
   Britain has 150,000 herds of cattle and the disease has
been identified in 7,500 of them, British officials say.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .

   France should legalize brothels, former Health Minister
Michele Barzach said. Since brothels were banned in 1946,
prostitutes haven't been subjected to obligatory medical
tests, and Ms. Barzach said that it was thus impossible to
keep tabs on the spread of AIDS within France's prostitute
community. . . . A butterless diet including a lot of
spaghetti and very little meat is the recipe for World Cup
soccer success, according to Italian team doctor Antonio
Vecchiet. For those on the team who are too nervous to sleep
he prescribes extra camomile tea.

   WOLFSBURG, West Germany -- Volkswagen AG outlined plans
for an expanded joint venture to produce and market autos and
car parts in Yugoslavia.
   The company said previously that it intended to expand its
relationship with the Yugoslavian industrial group UNIS.
Under a new agreement, Volkswagen will increase its stake in
the auto maker Tvornica Automobila Sarajevo to 50% from 49%.
UNIS will hold the remaining 50% of in Tvornica, which will
be transformed under new government rules into a West
German-style private limited-liability company, Volkswagen
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Volkswagen, West Germany's largest auto maker, said it
will boost its stake in the Yugoslavian company by
subscribing to a planned, though unspecified, increase in
Tvornica's share capital.
   Volkswagen said Tvornica has begun a 200 million-mark
($118.3 million), five-year capital investment program,
ending in 1995. The investments will be directed toward
modernizing the Yugoslavian venture's national production
network in an effort to boosts its competitive strength.
   Volkswagen said the most important of the new projects at
Tvornica, already a major supplier of diverse auto parts for
Volkswagen cars, will be to make rear axles to be supplied to
the West German company's Seat auto subsidiary in Spain.
Those deliveries are expected to begin by the end of this
year. The company hopes to gear up to assemble car engines by
the end of 1991.
   The capital investment program also is aimed at boosting
Tvornica's output of complete Volkswagen autos to about
45,000 units in 1992 from an aggregate 35,000 VW Golfs,
Jettas and Caddy models last year.
   The joint-venture company hopes to boost annual sales in
1992 to the equivalent of 700 million marks from 484 million
marks in 1989, Volkswagen said. The Yugoslavian venture
projects export sales in that period to rise to about 220
million marks from 150 million marks.
   Volkswagen has gotten off to a quick start in broadening
its business and operating presence in Eastern Europe,
following the opening of the Berlin Wall late last year. The
company has a major car development, production and marketing
venture planned for East Germany, and is negotiating a
similar arrangement with Czechoslavakia's auto maker, Skoda.

   WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan commission is recommending that
the political parties shave a day off their four-day
quadrennial conventions in an effort to sharpen their appeal
to television voters.
   The commission, which includes five current or past
national party chairmen, also recommends that each of the
major television networks allocate three hours of air time
for use by the parties and presidential candidates in the
months leading to the presidential election.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The commission suggests that during the parties' air time,
only the presidential and vice-presidential candidates be
permitted to address the public. The use of pre-produced
materials such as taped candidate biographies would be
barred.
   Democratic Party Chairman Ronald Brown already has
indicated his willingness to tinker with the national
political convention. He is toying with proposals either to
compress the proceedings or to conduct some of them over a
weekend, rather than during the week.
   Commission members said taking a day off the conventions
would make the proceedings seem less tedious. "We've got to
make them more enlightening and better to watch," said former
GOP Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf.

<LP>
   ConAgra Inc. agreed to acquire Beatrice Co. from Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. for a scaled-back $1.34 billion in cash
and stock.
   The price is about half the amount some Beatrice insiders
boasted the food company would fetch just before the October
1987 crash dashed those expectations. KKR still will profit
substantially, with a 50% annualized return from its
four-year ownership of Beatrice. The transaction price,
however, apparently also was below KKR's more-recent hopes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They kept saying our {offers} were way too low," Charles
M. (Mike) Harper, ConAgra chairman and chief executive
officer, said in an interview last night. But the acquisition
includes assumption of $987 million of long-term debt, an
additional $552 million in other noncurrent liabilities plus
$419 million in noncurrent and deferred taxes. More than half
of Beatrice's $3.5 billion in assets is good will, reflecting
the premium above book value that Beatrice has paid for
various acquisitions over the years.
   Among the household name-brands ConAgra would acquire are
Hunt's tomato products, Wesson oil, Orville Redenbacher
popcorn and Peter Pan peanut butterstrong brands that will
vastly enhance ConAgra's clout in the dry grocery business.
The company already is the nation's second-largest food
processor, behind the Kraft General Foods unit of Philip
Morris Cos. The transaction is subject to government
clearances.
   The proposed sale represents the last chunk of a
much-larger Beatrice that KKR swallowed for $8.2 billion in
1986. Since then, KKR has sold off 10 major pieces for a
total of about $7.7 billion.
   Terms call for ConAgra to pay $626 million in cash plus
$355 million in common stock and an identical amount in two
series of preferred stock for Beatrice. The company said the
proposed acquisition was not expected to dilute per-share
earnings, and it forecast record earnings for the year just
under way.
   For the fiscal year ended last May 28, ConAgra is expected
to report sales approaching $16 billion. In its latest fiscal
year, which ended last Feb. 28, Beatrice reported sales of
$4.3 billion. Thus a combined concern could easily exceed $20
billion in annual sales.
   KKR will end up, on a fully diluted basis, owning 15% of
ConAgra. KKR founding partner Henry Kravis indicated that KKR
intends to hold its ConAgra stake long-term, calling the
shares "excellent investments."
   While announcement of the proposed deal came after the
stock market had closed, Wall Street analysts initially
reacted favorably. "There's a very good fit," said Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co. food analyst Nomi Ghez, who noted that ConAgra
was acquiring Beatrice at less than 60% of its annual sales.
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst John M. McMillin
noted that ConAgra "has an insatiable appetite for cheap
assets."
   But both Moody's Investor Service Inc. and Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. debt-rating services put ConAgra under immediate
review for possible downgrading of some of it debt, although
Moody's said it anticipates "significant benefits" to ConAgra
from Beatrice's consumer food lines.
   Acknowledging that "we stretched our balance sheet
standard {of 35% long-term debt} on this," Mr. Harper said
the acquisition would put ConAgra at nearly 50% debt. "But we
intend to get back to 35% as soon as practical," he vowed,
noting that Beatrice has good cash flows.
   ConAgra, which is particularly strong in the red-meat
business, features such brands as Armour in meats, Banquet,
Healthy Choice and Morton in frozen foods, and Chun King and
Patio in ethnic prepared foods.
   There are some product overlaps. For example, in Chinese
foods Beatrice has LaChoy, while ConAgra already owns a
peanut-butter brand. Also, because both companies are major
forces in the prepared-meats business, government regulators
may study the proposal for antitrust implications.
   But Mr. Harper, asked about that, said he wasn't worried.
"We think we're below the threshold of their concern level.
We feel very confident about that." He said ConAgra was
particularly attracted by Beatrice's sales and distribution
system in the dry-grocery business, where it now is an
also-ran.
   ConAgra, which Mr. Harper likes to say dominates "the
middle of the plate," has been an aggressive food-business
buyer. In 1986 it bought RJR Nabisco's frozen-food unit,
including the Patio and Chun King brands, for $64 million; in
1987 it acquired Monfort, a large Colorado beef and lamb
concern, and in 1988 it added to its phalanx of flour mills
by picking up those of International Multifoods Corp. for $76
million. Last year it added Pillsbury Co.'s
grain-merchandising business, but lost out in a protracted
bidding war with Tyson Foods Inc. for Holly Farms Corp., a
large poultry processor.
   The assets ConAgra seeks include 63 manufacturing or
distribution facilities in 20 states and 15,900 employees at
Chicago-based Beatrice. ConAgra already employs more than
55,000 people world-wide and has operations in 25 countries.
   ConAgra shares closed at $32, up 75 cents, in composite
New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday. Volume was
relatively light, indicating that both parties had managed to
keep a lid on the proposal.
   Mr. Harper said the first discussion came while he was
riding a chairlift with investment banker Eric Gleacher in
Colorado, while skiing last January. Yesterday's acquisition
accord caps at least four months of talks between KKR and
ConAgra, following a get-acquainted meeting between Messrs.
Kravis and Harper.
   Mr. Kravis came away from those talks "impressed, talking
about how he would love to do something with Mike Harper," a
witness recalled.
   Beatrice in its current form has been shrunk almost
two-thirds from its sprawling size when KKR acquired the
company in 1986, as units such as Avis, Tropicana and Playtex
have been sold off. Nonetheless, the remaining core of the
business has proved tough for KKR to sell, mainly because of
possible tax liabilities and $1.8 billion of goodwill, an
accounting item that penalizes reported earnings.
   To finally sell Beatrice this spring, KKR asked that
ConAgra "get comfortable with the contingent liabilities"
before visiting Beatrice's operating units, said a KKR
adviser. That strategy was designed to avoid jitters that had
affected previous potential buyers, who liked Beatrice's
operating businesses but pulled back when they examined its
books more closely.
   On May 15, top ConAgra officials visited KKR's offices and
worked out the outlines of an acquisition agreement. ConAgra
then visited Beatrice sites in detail, and checked with
rating agencies to ensure that the debt involved in the
Beatrice acquisition wouldn't hurt its credit rating too
severely.
   Yesterday at 7:30 a.m., the Beatrice board held a
three-hour meeting at KKR's New York offices to approve the
proposed acquisition, while ConAgra did the same in Omaha. A
witness said that while the Beatrice board's vote was
unanimous, it was a "difficult" moment for Donald Kelly, the
former Beatrice chairman who had played a major role in
reshaping Beatrice in the first two years after the 1986
buy-out.
   In recent months, KKR -- which was by far the most active
takeover player of the 1980s -- has become noticeably less
active in seeking to take over entire companies. Instead, KKR
has been selling some of its portfolio companies and taking
minority stakes in publicly quoted companies.

conjunction with academic institutions, to advance technology
and initiate research projects.
   IBM Europe will provide the centers with advanced
hardware, a library of systems and application software, and
training and education for the staffs. It plans to lend the
computer equipment to the countries, including an IBM
3090-model mainframe priced at about $1 million, a spokesman
for the Armonk, N.Y.-based company said.

   This represents the first part of a broader initiative IBM
plans in Central and Eastern Europe to foster
information-technology advances and give scientists and
others access to tools to communicate in their fields or
participate in international projects. The centers will be
linked by a Vienna computer gateway to Western academic
networks.
   Setting up the centers is subject to export licenses being
granted by the U.S. and the Coordinating Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls. IBM said the Hungarian and
Czechoslovak partners will sign a document that states the
end use of the computers will be for peaceful purposes.
   Once established, the IBM centers will be staffed and
operated by the local IBM partners, for access by academics,
students and people in industry. IBM's partner in Hungary
will be the University of Economics in Budapest; in
Czechoslovakia, Charles University and the Czech Technical
University.

   Fluor Corp., Irvine, Calif., said it was awarded six
contracts with a combined value of $30 million from three
concerns.
   The engineering, construction and technical services
company said that its Fluor Daniel unit received two
contracts from Atlantic Richfield Co. for $17 million to
provide engineering and technical services to Atlantic
Richfield's Alaska unit.

   Fluor said its unit received two other contracts with a
combined value of $5 million from Big Rivers Electric Corp.,
a power plant owner and operator based in City of Henderson,
Ky., to provide maintenance services to nine coal-fired power
generating units.
   The unit received two contracts from the Fort Dodge
Laboratories unit of American Home Products Corp. valued at
$8 million. One contract is to provide engineering,
procurement, construction management and other services for a
veterinary products manufacturing facility in Sligo, Ireland.
The other contract is to design and help construct an
expansion to a veterinary products facility in Fort Dodge,
Iowa, Fluor said.

   WASHINGTON -- White House and congressional budget
negotiators appear to have discovered that, for all their
vows to reduce the deficit, there's little appetite for
cutting spending outside the Pentagon.
   A couple of Republicans emerged discouraged from
yesterday's review of government spending, but most
participants said they are resigned to another week of what
Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) called "a learning experience,
a get-people-involved experience."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Domenici said he doubts the parties will begin any
significant bargaining for another 10 days. White House
Budget Director Richard Darman called that assessment
"realistic," although he has been pressing for a faster pace.
   When Mr. Darman expressed impatience at yesterday's
session, participants said, Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.)
responded by reading excerpts from a 1967 speech by then-Rep.
George Bush asserting that President Lyndon Johnson wasn't
exercising presidential leadership.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt told negotiators he
still hopes for an agreement in principle this month and
vowed longer and more frequent meetings toward that end,
participants said.
   The budget summit agreed to form a
congressional-administration staff group to prepare a list of
ways to cut spending on federal entitlement programs, Mr.
Darman said.

   NEW YORK -- New York City officials are expected to
announce as early as today that five large Wall Street
investment banking firms have been picked to head its new
bond underwriting syndicate.
   A spokesman for city Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman
wouldn't confirm the names, but other officials said the
city's senior underwriting managers are CS First Boston
Inc.'s First Boston Corp. unit; Goldman, Sachs & Co.; the
Bear Stearns Cos. Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. unit; American Express
Co.'s Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit and Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last year New York issued about $35 billion of general
obligation bonds and paid more than $30 million in fees to
its lead and other underwriters. The city's senior
underwriting managers were Goldman and Merrill Lynch, but the
city dropped Merrill when the firm moved some jobs to New
Jersey.
   The new list doesn't include any firms headed by
minorities or women. Mayor David Dinkins, is believed to have
wanted to include at least one minority or woman-headed firm
as a senior manager, while Ms. Holtzman placed emphasis on
the size of the firms, analysts said. Dinkins administration
officials have stressed that the lineup can change at the
last minute, although an official familiar with the process
said a change seems unlikely.

   Canada Talks Stall After Fifth Day
   Over Quebec's Bid for Special Status

   OTTAWA -- Negotiations to resolve Canada's constitutional
impasse stalled last night after five days of talks, and
several provincial premiers warned that the situation is
critical.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the nation's 10
provincial premiers have been meeting here since Sunday night
to try to resolve the constitutional dispute. They will meet
again this morning. The premiers are stalemated over
recognition of French-speaking Quebec as a "distinct society"
within Canada.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We say enough is enough," said Quebec Premier Robert
Bourassa. Quebec "can't and won't accept amendments" to the
Meech Lake accord, a package of proposed constitutional
amendments. One Meech Lake clause recognizes Quebec as a
"distinct society."
   The provision is highly prized by Quebec as recognition of
its cultural uniqueness even though constitutional lawyers
say it won't add to the province's powers. The distinct
society clause "simply confirms the obvious," said Mr.
Mulroney. Quebec, he said, is different, and "that difference
is very much worth conserving in the interest of Quebeckers
and of all Canadians."
   Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells said "it seems highly
unlikely" the premiers will be able to reach an agreement if
Quebec refuses to budge on the "distinct society" issue.
Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon said "we are in a very critical
situation."
   Several premiers were optimistic they would be able to
reach an agreement yesterday as they entered the government
conference here where they are meeting. Over the course of
the day provincial goverment officials said the premiers were
making progress. By late afternoon the officials were saying
the talks were at a decisive stage. They said all issues had
been discussed, proposed solutions were on the table and it
was now up to the premiers to accept or reject the proposals.
   Talks also involve reform of the federal Senate. Ontario
and Quebec each has 24 seats in the 104-seat chamber. The
smaller provinces are demanding a more equitable distribution
of seats.
   The smaller provinces have also been urging that the
Canadian Senate become more like the U.S. Senate in order to
get more power over the federal government. The Canadian
Senate is supposed to be a forum for regional concerns, but
it currently has only limited authority because its members
are appointed instead of elected. The appointments are made
by the prime minister.
   Some Canadians have reservations about a more powerful
Senate. "An elected Senate will bring substantive change to
Canada's parliamentary system, weaken central government,
diminish the powers of the House of Commons and make the
political process more derivative of American practice and
less influenced by the British experiences," said Dalton
Camp, a former senior aide to Mr. Mulroney.
   Quebec has refused to participate in negotiations on
Senate reform or any other constitutional issue until its
demands on the accord are met. The Quebec government says the
Meech Lake Accord will satisfy its "minimum" demands.
   The other provinces agreed several years ago to give
priority to Quebec's concerns because major constitutional
changes were made in 1982 without the consent of the Quebec
government. Government leaders had also pledged to address
the province's constitutional demands after Quebeckers
rejected separation from Canada in a 1980 provincial
referendum.
   Several provincial leaders said they recognized that
Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa had little room for maneuver
in the negotiations because he is faced with an opposition
party, the Parti Quebecois, which advocates Quebec
independence.
   Parti Quebecois leader Jacques Parizeau attacked Mr.
Bourassa earlier this week for allegedly making concessions
to the other provinces, and he demanded that Mr. Bourassa
abandon the negotiations.

   Businesses Map Plans for Use of Tiger Geographical Files
   ---
   Census Bureau Data, Now on Disk,
   Offer Opportunities and Headaches

   Countless small businesses can't wait to use the Census
Bureau's new Tiger file. But Tiger is proving tough to tame.
   Tiger, a landmark project in demography, is a minutely
detailed computerized map of the entire U.S. When combined
with a data base such as the results of the 1990 census or a
company's own customer files, Tiger gives desktop computer
users for the first time the cartographic equivalent of the
computerized spread sheet.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Software companies, some run by Census Bureau veterans,
are writing Tiger-based programs that allow small companies
to create "smart maps" on their own computers. Users can ask
various "what if . . ." questions and print out the answers
in map form. Only mainframe computer customers could perform
this trick before, and never with the geographic precision
provided by Tiger.
   Retailers, banks, franchisers, vehicle fleet operators,
marketers, and direct mail houses are excited about the
combined Tiger-census file. So are political consultants and
special interest groups, who see it as a revolutionary way to
approach political redistricting.
   Package delivery companies can use Tiger technology to
figure out the fastest and most efficient routes for their
truck fleets. By juggling population, age and income figures
with geography, retailers can pinpoint on a computer-screen
map the best location for a new store.
   The Census Bureau's computer map is "an amazing product .
. . that has immediate uses," says Stephen Poizner, president
of Strategic Mapping Inc., San Jose, Calif. His company's new
program for PCs, Atlas*Gis, incorporates Tiger.
   But training users in Tiger talk may be more difficult
than originally thought. The Census Bureau provides Tiger
files on magnetic tapes for mainframes and on compact discs
(CD-ROM) for PCs at bargain prices -- $250 for a disc that
maps an entire state -- but the data is tough for the
non-computer professional to digest.
   Viewed by itself, Tiger resembles uncooked spaghetti, a
jumble of random lines and address numbers. "Tiger is 16
billion lines," says Ed Spar, president of New York-based
Market Statistics. "Until you turn those things into
coordinates, and blend them with a mapping software package,
you haven't got much."
   Some purchasers of the first Tiger tapes say they've found
an uncomfortable level of errors in the geographic
information, including erroneous addresses and missing postal
ZIP code numbers.
   The Tiger tapes "are significantly different from what was
promised," grumbles Skip Hunt, general manager of Donnelley
Marketing Information Services, Stamford, Conn. Jeanne
Savage, a manager in the geographic information systems
division of International Business Machines Corp., says Tiger
tapes that IBM has seen vary from "very accurate" to "OK."
   Census enumerators are using Tiger maps in checking
households that didn't send in census forms and are penciling
in corrections. "No map is completely up to date," says
Robert LaMacchia, a Census Bureau assistant division chief
for planning. "Through use, the {Tiger} data will become
current and represent what's actually on the ground."
   "There's going to be a whole industry that's going to take
Tiger, improve it, and resell it at a premium," adds
Donnelley's Mr. Hunt. Mr. Poizner says he expects "a ton of
competitors," as the concept of desktop mapping becomes
better known.
   Tiger's formal name is the Topologically Integrated
Geographic Encoding and Reference file. It's an ambitious,
seven-year, $200 million project that lists in digital form
every highway, street, bridge and tunnel in the 50 states.
Each city block or stretch of country road carries its own
range of addresses. In scope and level of detail, Tiger and
its associated computer programs stand alone in the desktop
mapping arena.
   Software companies are scrambling to take advantage of
this statistical mother lode. "It looks like the government
opened up a big oil field," says Don Cooke, president of
Geographic Data Technology, Lyme, N.H., who helped compile
Tiger when he worked at the Census Bureau. Mr. Cooke says the
Detroit-based data firm R.L. Polk is paying his company $3
million "to clean up Tiger and make it work for direct mail."
   Mr. Cooke thinks there's also a payoff in programs that
help delivery services get better productivity from their
vehicles. "Everybody running a big truck fleet is looking at
this technology," he says.
   Routing Technology Software Inc., Vienna, Va., markets
software called Roadshow. It ponders the number and location
of orders received by a company, then divides the day's
deliveries between vans, laying out the sequence of stops and
the most efficient route to drive. Tiger, "in its present
form, is probably too tough to use so there's an opportunity
for companies like ours to predigest it," says Donald Soults,
Routing Technology's president.
   Even the watered-down version can be intimidating. "I
can't even explain it to you, and I've seen it three times,"
says Richard Orloff, marketing manager for the Asbury Park
Press, an afternoon newspaper in central New Jersey. The
newspaper uses Roadshow to deploy its circulation trucks.
   Fred Barber, research demographer in the Washington
consulting firm Matthew Greenwald &amp; Associates, warns that
Tiger is untested in the marketplace and complex for the
average PC user. "Small businesses, retailers and
distributors who can get on top of this are going to have a
competitive advantage. But I think the learning curve is
going to be a bit steep."
   Computer hardware may be a problem. Tiger programs require
more computer capacity than some small businesses possess.
And the price of software that can be linked to Tiger could
come as a shock to the entrepreneur who is used to paying
$400 for a sophisticated spread sheet. "You're talking about
$2,500 for a piece of software that doesn't even include
Tiger data," says Joe Francica, commercial applications
manager for Tydac Technologies Corp. of Ottawa.
   But Strategic Mapping's Mr. Poizner says: "I'm shocked if
anyone thinks price is an issue. If you're building a new
store, you're talking $1 million in real estate and
construction costs."

   Lonrho PLC, a British trading conglomerate, said interim
pretax profit eased 8.3% from year-earlier levels, when
taking into account last year's disposal of bulk whisky
stocks. Sales of platinum group metals and gold contributed
"significantly" to earnings in the current period, the
company said.
   Excluding last year's #38 million ($64.2 million) disposal
of bulk whisky stocks, pretax profits rose 34%.

   Profit attributable to shareholders before extraordinary
items fell to #56 million from #70 million last year.
   The company said in addition to the contribution from
mineral extraction and refining, its Hondo Oil &amp; Gas division
saw improved profits in the first half. The group's hotels
and newspaper interests in the U.K. produced higher profits,
although the manufacturing and motor companies were hit by
the downturn in the British economy. The company didn't
provide a detailed breakdown by division and officials
weren't immediately available for comment.

   Assailed at Home, Gorbachev
   Faces Test on Economic Plan

   MOSCOW -- Mikhail Gorbachev has left behind the cheering
American crowds and come home to confusion and critical
deadlines on the economic front. Within a week, he must find
support for his latest economic proposal, now under attack
from all sides.
   After several years of halfway measures that generally
have only worsened the shortages, speculation and daily
hardships, the Soviet people show little to no faith in the
government's ability to improve the situation. The Soviet
Parliament plans to decide next week whether to approve the
latest Gorbachev program. It has already extended its session
twice to grapple with the issue.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov announced the program
May 24, its backers such as First Deputy Premier Leonid
Abalkin have been campaigning in the media for public
understanding of the plan to turn a centrally controlled
economy into a market economy.
   But politicians and economists from the right and left are
assailing the program, and most people here simply don't
understand what a market economy is.
   "In Moscow today you find more opinions than people," Axel
Lebahn, director of Deutsche Bank AG, said at a recent
conference on the outlook for investment in the Soviet Union.
   Those who are classed as conservatives here argue that the
program doesn't protect workers from unemployment or
inflation. They say its risks are great and that the worker
will have to bear the greatest burden in the transition,
paying higher prices without being adequately compensated.
   On the other side, some argue that the transition
envisioned is too slow. Others say that the overall pace may
be adequate but that the program is starting from the wrong
place by making price increases one of the first steps.
   The program outlines a five-year transition to take place
in three stages:
   First, 1990 would be spent preparing price changes, and
the social and legal framework for a market economy.
   Next, in 1991 and 1992, the government would still direct
some industrial and agricultural production, but a new price
and tax system, higher interest rates and other fundamental
measures will be implemented. Some state property will be
transferred to collective, semiprivate or individual control.
   Finally, from 1993 to 1995, market pricing and competition
are to develop rapidly as central control withers away.
   The program's architects say that unemployment will rise
and production will fall in the first two years of the
program but that 1993 should start to bring an improvement in
living standards. The government rejected the alternative of
Polish-style "shock therapy," an immediate freeing of prices
and an halt to government subsidies like those adopted by the
new non-Communist government in Poland, as extreme and
politically risky.
   For the public, however, the first concrete evidence of
what this plan will mean was the government's announcement of
a tripling of bread prices as of July 1 followed by price
increases on many other foods, consumer goods and services
next Jan. 1. The program also provides for raises in pay, but
its opponents say the increases won't fully compensate
anyone.
   The announcement sparked a flurry of shopping and
hoarding, with Muscovites standing in line for hours to buy
such staples as matches and macaroni. More important, by
announcing the price rises as a first step to a market
economy, the government fed popular fears that a market
economy simply means higher prices.
   "The most dangerous thing with this program is that it can
discredit the whole idea of the market," says Rair Simonyan,
a senior economist at the Institute of World Economy.
Pro-reform economists agree that price overhaul is essential,
but some say it is the wrong place to start. Prices could
evolve more naturally if industry were put in private hands
first, they say.
   "It would have been wiser to have started from the other
end, from agriculture -- giving the freedom of economic
activity on the land," says Oleg Bogomolov, director of the
Institute of the Economics of the World Socialist System.
Large state-owned farms could be leased in parcels to
families and cooperatives, he says, and there could be a
gradual reduction of their legal obligation to deliver
certain kinds and amounts of products.
   But the program's designers defend starting with price
increases, saying they will familiarize people with real
price structures and will help soak up the roughly 160
billion rubles ($268 billion at the official exchange rate)
in cash that the Soviet people are estimated to have stashed
away.
   In the past week, Mr. Abalkin has tried to separate the
price increases from the fundamental concept of a market
economy. In several newspaper interviews and a televised
debate, he has explained that price rises are only a
preparation to allow a move to a market economy. He said the
government announced them at an early stage to be honest with
the people. "The only chance for avoiding social eruption is
to honestly declare the intentions of the government," he
said in an interview with Pravda this week.
   But the people appear unconvinced. The nation's largest
coal-mining area has threatened a strike to protest the price
rises, and the three largest Soviet republics have all voted
to refuse to impose them. A recent poll by the All-Union
Center for Studies of National Public Opinion found that 77%
of those surveyed expect increased economic difficulties or
an economic catastrophe. Only 32% tended to believe the
current government would be able to lead the country out of
the crisis.
   Says Levada Alexandrovich, a senior researcher at the
polling center: "For a long time we've lived a socialist
life, and it's not a joke. It's not a good life, but a large
part of the population is accustomed to it -- to not so much
wages and not so many goods, but more or less stability."

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Newsreels May Offer a Way Into Theaters

   Booing and hissing by outraged moviegoers helped persuade
Disney and Warner, among others, to ban commercials from
theater screens showing their films.
   But intrepid advertisers in search of a captive audience
are undaunted. And now, they have found a new way to sneak
into theaters by the backdoor: newsreels.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Once a staple of movie showings, newsreels are starting to
resurface. Today's version, though, is less likely to be a
recap of current events and more likely to be a blatant
vehicle for advertisers. The most notable of the bunch, "The
Popcorn Report," is basically just a series of video news
releases strung together. Cable News Network last week began
testing a more conventional newsreel, shown commercial-free
in a dozen Manhattan theaters, and is already out scouting
around for sponsors.
   Stan Zeitlin, president of West Glen Communications, which
puts out the Popcorn Report, believes the newsreels will fly
even in theaters that wouldn't normally allow commercials.
Indeed, he says, the Disney and Warner ad bans have been
terrific for business: Advertisers frozen out of running ads
in theaters are now considering the pseudo-newsreel as a way
to circumvent the ban. Advertisers provide West Glen the
video news release and pay $12,500 to be included in the
report. The report, Mr. Zeitlin says, is positioned "as a
short subject, not as a commercial. It's more subtle."
   Subtlety, apparently, is in the eye of the beholder. A
recent Popcorn Report includes a segment on cotton that is an
undisguised promotion for Cotton Inc., the cotton trade
group. In just two minutes, the viewer is treated to a long
shot of Cotton Inc. headquarters, an interview with a Cotton
Inc. executive, and a glimpse of a Cotton Inc. fashion show
in which the trade group's logo looms larger than life. Other
segments score about the same on the subtlety scale, with
"sponsors" ranging from Sandoz Pharmaceuticals to Skippy
Peanut Butter.
   That bash-'em-over-the-head approach may not pass muster
among some ad-ban proponents. At Loews Theater Management
Corp., which doesn't allow commercials on its 850 movie
screens, "we won't accept any commercial advertising for our
screens in whatever form. We wouldn't go for anything that
would make anyone even slightly bristle in their seats," a
spokesman says. At General Cinema, which allows
advertiser-sponsored slides before the lights go down on its
1,400 screens, but which bars filmed commercials, a spokesman
says a newsreel would be considered. But he adds, "if it's
blatant advertising, we'd be opposed to it."
   Disney executives couldn't be reached, while at Warner, a
spokesman says the only advertising or promotions the studio
would welcome would be those pushing other films. "The reason
for the ban on screen advertising is because it isn't related
to movies. We don't want to lose screen advertising time for
our upcoming movies," he says.
   How Disney and Warner stand on the newsreels is of
enormous importance to the advertisers. Disney is about to
release the summer's most talked-about new movie, "Dick
Tracy," while Warner, which scored last summer with "Batman,"
is coming out with "Gremlins II." Advertisers would love to
find a way to sneak back onto the screens where both studios'
films are showing; if they can't, advertising in theaters
could be far less effective.
   To try to make advertising more palatable to the big
studios, CNN is going the low-key route as it searches for
sponsors. "We're hoping to get somebody interested in just a
mention at the beginning -- CNN Reel News is brought to you
by Nabisco, or something like that," a CNN spokeswoman says.
"Hopefully, they can get it to be real inconspicuous."
   CNN's newsreel, which lasts just over two minutes, puts
together light news clips that have already aired on CNN,
like a story about the last manned lighthouse. The
unsponsored test will last for three months before CNN
decides if and how to expand.
   Advertiser interest since the Disney and Warner ad-ban
decisions, meanwhile, is prompting West Glen to consider
expanding. So far, it has remained a tiny operation, with
just 50 copies of each "Popcorn Report" edition. But since
the bans, some national advertisers have expressed interest,
including one of the networks seeking to promote its fall
season, Mr. Zeitlin says. As a result, he says, it is "quite
probable" that within the next two weeks he'll expand the
report. He also wants to increase the frequency to bimonthly
from quarterly.
   There's no assurance, though, that the theaters will run
the pseudo-newsreel; currently, participating theaters get
the report for free, and run it as often -- or as
infrequently -- as they'd like. But Mr. Zeitlin says he
thinks theaters will bite, contending: "It is certainly a
form of advertising, there's no question about that. But

   Nintendo Picks Foote Cone
                                                                                                       

   Foote, Cone &amp; Belding's San Francisco office added a major
national advertiser to its client roster, winning the video
games account from Nintendo of America.
   Nintendo, based in Redmond, Wash., said the account will
bill $35 million this year. According to Leading National
Advertisers, Nintendo spent only about $15 million
advertising its game products last year, but Nintendo said
the figure was actually much higher.
   The account had previously been handled by
McCann-Erickson, a unit of Interpublic Group. Donald Coyner,
Nintendo's advertising manager, wouldn't say what prompted
the switch.
   He did say, however, that Foote Cone's work with Levi
Strauss and other youth-related clients was a factor in
awarding the account to that shop. "We feel that the guys in
the San Francisco office can help us well into the future,"
he said.
   In addition to Foote Cone, Nintendo also considered
Chicago-based Leo Burnett for the business.

   Town Finds Good Health
   Can Be Hard to Live With

   WELLSBURG, W.Va. -- For two years, residents of this rural
hamlet feasted on cottage-cheese omelets and did daily
rigorous exercises as part of a bold medical experiment. The
maker of Bayer aspirin wanted to see if changes in diet and
life style could bring more "wellness" to Wellsburg.
   The Bayer Wellness Program is a widely publicized study
pegged to making people aware of how to lower the risk of
heart attacks. It officially ends this weekend, and there
have been some successes in lowering cholesterol and
blood-pressure levels, among other health benefits.
Participants didn't necessarily take aspirin, although in
promotional material Bayer noted that its product could
prevent second heart attacks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, to ensure that townspeople stay on the
healthy track, Bayer has donated $30,000 to install a jogging
trail as well as other programs to keep the health
consciousness going.
   But while the program seems to have temporarily promoted
some better health here, residents aren't certain that's
something to cheer about. And some wonder whether the program
will result in lasting change, as people return to their old
habits and patterns.
   Joan Wilson, for one, is glad it's over.
   "Honey, these people ate so much oat bran around here that
it was unbelievable," says Mrs. Wilson, owner of Ye Ole
Townhouse, a local restaurant. Now that the program is
ending, though, "some of these people are switching from fish
and going back to what they used to order, like B.L.T.s," she
adds. "You can't eat oatmeal forever."
   For 67-year-old Charlotte Jackson, the program wasn't as
successful as she'd hoped. "I like to eat. I did cut down on
the red meats and watched the fat, but my cholesterol is
still over 200," says the 5-foot-1-inch, 180-pound Mrs.
Jackson.
   Others say they've changed their life styles only
partially. Ronald Antigo was tricked into participating by
his wife, who poured skim milk into whole-milk containers and
used turkey in recipes like chili that called for ground
beef. He initially lost about 10 pounds, but since he retired
in January, he's been eating more -- and now has gained those
pounds back. He also gave up smoking and drinking, but now
spends $30 a month on chewing gum.
   The town's ambivalence toward its new-found health is
immediately apparent to any visitor. A banner at the edge of
town reads, "Welcome to Wellsburg, Home of the Bayer Wellness
Program." Underneath, in big red letters, another banner
reads: "Buy One Sundae Get Another One Free," an
advertisement for Dad's Sweet Tooth, the local ice-cream
emporium.
   "We still have people who come in here and buy ice cream,"
says Charis Moatis, manager of the malt shop. Even residents
who choose the lower-calorie frozen yogurt, which has been a
big seller the past two years, heap on sundae toppings, she
says.
   Still, Bayer officials insist that the $3.3 million
program was a success -- and results give some support to
their assertions. "We proved our point," asserts Richard
Gaccione, president of Bayer, which is owned by Eastman Kodak
Co. through its Sterling Drug unit. "You can actually get
people to change their life styles and vital signs in such a
way that they can reduce heart attacks in their community."
   Wellsburg was selected as the program site because it was
a small, generally unhealthy town in a state with high levels
of obesity, cholesterol and heart disease. (West Virginia
ranks seventh in the nation in the incidence of heart attack,
according to the latest study by the national Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta.)
   At the program's outset, 65% of the 517 people who
participated the full two years (another 500 or so dropped
out along the way) had a cholesterol level of 200 or more.
Though 55% still do, cholesterol levels for the group fell an
average 12 points, to 208 from 220.
   That may not sound like much. But each one-point drop
lowers the likelihood of heart attack by 2%. "They're going
to get a 25% fall in their heart-attack rate. That's
tremendous," says William Castelli, director of a division of
the National Institutes of Health that studies heart disease
in Framingham, Mass. "You have to fight for every 1% fall.
They did it hygienically, no drugs."
   Consider Earl Mitchell, a self-described onetime "couch
potato" and fan of fast food. He lost 80 pounds and trimmed
50 points off his cholesterol level. "The program has changed
my life completely," he says.
   Though other health experts view the results positively,
they are also somewhat skeptical because Bayer won't publish
them in any medical journal. Bayer's Mr. Gaccione explains
that this wasn't a clinical study, so Bayer won't publish
results in medical journals; however, it will publish results
for its own staff and make those findings available.
   The participation group also lowered its average pulse
rate by five beats per minute, its average systolic blood
pressure by six points and achieved an 11% reduction in body
fat (though the average weight loss was just 3.4 pounds).
   The best results were achieved among residents with the
highest risk of heart disease. The average cholesterol of
this subgroup dropped 18 points, to 226 from 244. "The sicker
they were, the more effective we were in getting them to make
behavioral change," says William Reger, director of the
program.
   Behavioral changes included a daily regimen of exercise
(regular exercisers increased to 60% of participants from 26%
previously). In addition, participants were encouraged to
attend medical lectures and were advised on their diets.
Bayer hired four full-time staff workers to run the program,
and there were 250 volunteers who conducted support sessions
for people trying to quit smoking (57% did).
   "We didn't tell people what they could and couldn't do,"
Dr. Reger says. "We gave them the information to make the
proper choices."

   Campaign Unreform

<LP>
   As the Senate revs up to pass campaign-reform legislation,
enthusiasts should recall how the last batch of "reforms"
turned out. As usual, the do-gooders seem to have done more
good for themselves than for the general public.
   Last year's "reform" of congressional ethics turned out to
be a back-door pay raise for members of Congress.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The "reform" of franked mail regulations was heralded as
curtailing the free mailings that have given incumbents an
almost insurmountable advantage over challengers. But in the
House the cost of such mailings has practically doubled --
from the $41 million budgeted for this year to an estimated
$79 million.
   No wonder Congress loves "reform."
   And no wonder the public is unenthusiastic about the
campaign-reform legislation gathering steam in the Senate.
   The measures being negotiated behind closed doors are
another example of incumbent self-perpetuation disguised as
statesmanship. The evils to be vanquished are "unlimited
spending," according to the Democrats, and "special
interests," according to the Republicans.
   But the Democrats really want full public financing of
campaigns and even greater perks and security for incumbents.
(Most incumbents are Democrats.) The Republicans really want
to block the Democrats without appearing to be against
"reform." So the enterprise boils down not to the Democrats
vs. the Republicans, but to the Incumbents vs. the
Challengers -- the Imperial Congress vs. the Voters.
   Campaigns cost too much, say the Democrats. In speeches
introducing their bill, they bemoaned "the money chase {that}
has corrupted the political process of this country" and "the
escalating arms race of fund-raising that is destroying the
system." Their prescription: public funding and overall
campaign spending limits.
   Democrats stress the spending limits are voluntary, but
apparently no one will volunteer without the lure of
substantial government benefits: low-cost television time,
subsidized campaign mail (there they go again), and public
money to match money spent by independent groups and
"excessive" spending by an opponent.
   To collect all these goodies, the incumbent merely has to
promise not to spend more than a certain limit. But if the
challenger, swimming upstream against the powerful current of
incumbent advantage, spends more than the limit, the
incumbent gets millions more in public money, and the
spending limit is removed.
   Republicans oppose spending limits. The centerpiece of
their "reform" proposal is the abolition of political action
committees. PACs, so it is argued, are "special interests"
that dominate campaigns and give more to incumbents than
challengers.
   The Democrats recently jumped on the "Kill PACs"
bandwagon, and the good-government forces are now shifting
into bipartisan high gear.
   Initial posturing is completed. Partisan positions are
staked out. Bipartisan negotiations are under way. Now,
observe the next step in this typical dance: In the coming
weeks a bipartisan compromise is likely to emerge, and there
will be much back-patting among the reformers -- Democrats
and Republicans alike. If scientists measure the hot air
coming from the Senate wing of the Capitol, they'll probably
identify it as a critical source of global warming.
   The truth is, there always have been "special interests"
in American politics, and there should be. People get into
politics because they are interested in something, mad about
something, or want to get something done. If teachers, oil
workers or accountants have a beef with Washington and want
to band together to support or oppose a candidate for
Congress -- what's wrong with that?
   Nothing. It's one of the animating principles of our
Constitution. Madison explains in "The Federalist Papers"
that a multiplicity of "interests" are fundamental to
republican government. De Tocqueville observed: "As soon as
several inhabitants of the United States have taken up an
opinion or feeling they wish to promote . . . and as soon as
they have found one another out, they combine. From that
moment they are no longer isolated men, but a power seen from
afar, whose . . . language is listened to." Perhaps the
moralists and would-be reformers of today should reflect upon
De Tocqueville's conclusion that the banding together of
citizens to promote these "special interests" enhanced both
individual rights and the common good.
   PACs make "special interest" money both public and
accountable. The alternative, at least in the past, was that
special interests exerted influence behind closed doors. Read
Robert Caro's latest book on President Johnson: During the
1948 Senate campaign, Johnson aides took $50,000 cash
donations from oil tycoons in paper bags, he claims.
   In the last campaign, PAC money for all Senate races
constituted an estimated 23% of campaign money, vs. 64% from
individuals. And, like PACs, individuals also gave more to
incumbents than they did to challengers. Eliminating PACs
makes no more sense than eliminating individual
contributions.
   Most important, eliminating PACs probably would be
unconstitutional. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court left
no doubt that campaign contributions and expenditures are
protected as a form of expression by the First Amendment. And
PACs, as voluntary associations of free citizens seeking
lawful political aims, are protected by the Constitution as
well.
   Also in dubious constitutional standing are the provisions
in the Democratic bill that guarantee that public revenues
will be used to match "excessive" spending by an opponent or
by PACs or other independent groups. What does it do to the
protected political expression of a challenger who, as he
spends more money -- as he must necessarily do -- to take on
a powerful incumbent, has his expression effectively
nullified by an ever larger public subsidy flowing to the
incumbent?
   Granting reduced TV broadcast rates and mail costs to
candidates using public money, while denying them to those
using private money, is also likely to run afoul of the First
Amendment. The American Civil Liberties Union calls this
"effort to micromanage the content of political speech . . .
wholly inappropriate and unconstitutional," declaring:
"Surely, there is no justification for allowing a publicly
benefitted candidate to pay only 25% of the price of a
first-class stamp, while a privately financed candidate pays
full rate."
   Incumbents claim they're forced to spend too much time
chasing campaign money, at the expense of their jobs in
Congress. If that is true, why is last year's average for
roll-call-vote attendance 94% in the House and 98% in the
Senate? How do members find the time to act on bills
designating "National Tap Dance Day" or "National Juke Box
Week"?
   Then there is the claim that campaigns are too expensive.
Put it in perspective: $459 million was spent in the last
election on all House and Senate campaigns. That's less than
the amount spent to advertise just snacks and soft drinks on
network TV: $492.8 million. In 1988, each of 52 American
companies spent more on advertising alone than the combined
cost of all the campaigns for the U.S. Senate that year.
   What's really wrong is not campaign finance -- it's what
goes on in Congress itself. To truly limit the power of
incumbents, bring fresh blood and competition into
congressional races, and correct some related abuses in
Congress, we should:
   1. Limit terms. The career Congress, with its 98%
incumbent re-election rate in the House and 85% in the
Senate, breeds cynicism, now at epidemic proportions.
   We have strayed far from the Founders' idea of
landholders, merchants, farmers, and those in the various
professions coming to represent their fellow citizens for a
time in the national legislature. We have forgotten that, in
a civic sense, returning home is as important as coming to
Washington in the first place.
   Limiting representatives to six terms and senators to two
seems reasonable.
   2. End free mail. The franking privilege gives incumbents
a huge advantage over challengers. Reforms, controls, and
limits haven't worked.
   In fiscal 1989, one Republican senator mailed 12.1 million
pieces with a price-tag of $2.7 million. A Democratic
colleague sent out 10.3 million items at a cost of $1.7
million. He fired out one million pieces of mail in the first
quarter of fiscal 1990.
   In 1988, the latest year for which figures have been
disclosed, members of both houses mailed 805 million
newsletters and other franked mail -- more than seven pieces
for every household in America -- at a postal cost of $113.4
million, according to the estimates of the House clerk.
   3. Cut congressional spending. The money Congress spends
just on itself is outrageous. It took Congress 191 years to
reach an annual budget of $1 billion in 1980. Just 10 years
later, it had climbed to $2 billion. With reduced budgets,
fewer staffers and fewer perks, incumbents could perform
their duties and have less idle time and fewer resources to
waste.
   4. Shorten the campaign season. Members of Congress should
volunteer to defer fund-raising until 12 months before any
given election. Think how it would free them to devote their
attention to important legislation]
   5. Insist on openness. Full disclosure of all campaign
contributions is the best accountability imaginable. Citizens
would have the freedom and power to band together and
contribute to candidates. Voters would know everything and
could make their decisions accordingly.
   Pundits and politicians profess to be concerned about the
growing cynicism of American voters. But the campaign reforms
before the Senate are exactly the kind of legislation that
fosters such cynicism from Portland to Pueblo to Peoria.

   ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands -- Royal Dutch/Shell Group
completed a study on restructuring operations at its Pernis
refinery and will make a decision on whether to go ahead with
the two billion guilder ($1.06 billion) renovation in the
first half of 1991, a company spokesman said.
   Shell spent approximately 2.5 billion guilders upgrading
Pernis with a hydrogen-conversion unit and related
facilities, which produce higher than normal yields of
lighter petroleum products, such as gasolines, from heavier
crudes. Work on the hydrogen-conversion unit, which started
in 1984, ended last year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The spokesman declined to specify what new processes or
operations the study called for. But he said the
restructuring at the Group's largest European refinery would
be specifically aimed at reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide
and nitrous oxide and producing lighter products from heavier
crude oils.
   The spokesman declined to confirm whether the switch to
facilities capable of processing heavier oils was a defensive
move aimed at repositioning the refinery ahead of an expected
drop in output of light, low sulfur oils.
   But he did say: "When we look to the far future, we see
that we will have to get heavier oils out of the ground."
   If Shell proceeds with the restructuring, new construction
at the plant would be completed by 1995, roughly five years
before Dutch government-mandated reductions in emissions go
into effect.
   The study envisions reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide
and nitrous oxide from the plant by 70% from 1980 levels.
Current levels are 55% less than 1980 levels.
   Output at the 350,000-barrel-a-day capacity plant won't be
interrupted by the restructuring efforts, the spokesman said.

   Behind the bright lights of the anti-communist revolution
that has swept Eastern Europe lie the cold details of
remaking nations and their economies. It is important that
the West not lose interest as these incipient democracies now
take up the hard part. For Czechoslovakia, that begins this
weekend as citizens go to the polls for the first free
election in 42 years.
   The country's new Parliament will be drafting a
constitution, an undertaking no less important than the task
that confronted the Founders of the United States 200 years
ago. This will be the fifth version of the country's
constitution since the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia
united with Slovakia in 1918. The current squabbling between
the country's Czechs and Slovaks reflects an identity crisis
that has haunted Czechoslovakia throughout its history.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The internal divisions among the 10 million Czechs, five
million Slovaks plus Hungarian, German, Polish, Ruthenian and
Romany nationalities have made the country easy prey to
external and internal predators. The Slovaks have felt all
along that the dominant Czechs reneged on a promise of Slovak
autonomy. But it wasn't until about the 20th birthday of
Czechoslovakia before Slovaks could find someone to take up
their cause. The tragedy was that that someone turned out to
be Adolf Hitler.
   When the "Fuhrer" swooped down on Czechoslovakia in 1938,
he renamed the country "Czecho-Slovakia," with a hyphen and a
capital S, the same spelling Slovakian separatists have been
demanding this year. The 1948 communist "coup d'etat" brought
Czechoslovakia under a Stalinist constitution. Perversely,
Communist rule had the effect of unifying the country. The
political and cultural liberties of the Czechs were trampled
as much as those of the other nationalities. Anti-communism
was a sentiment all groups could support.
   But when constitutional tinkering in 1960 eased press and
cultural restrictions, the issue of Czech domination of the
other nationalities once again caught fire. Jan Carnogursky,
one of Slovakia's leading human-rights and religious
activists, and who emerged from prison as the November
revolution began to unfold, wants Slovakia to apply as a
separate entity for membership to the Common Market. He could
succeed this weekend in leading his right-wing Christian
Democratic Party to victory over the Civic Forum's Slovakian
affiliate. Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's current and
undoubtedly future president, has been crisscrossing the
country trying to defuse the issue, but without much success.
   Since all parties agree that the country needs to adopt a
market economy, tough issues such as privatization, currency
reform and the development of capital markets rank low in the
electioneering. Despite this promising consensus on economic
policy, the people responsible for it will need solid
political support, not factionalism, if they are to have the
courage to carry through on these reform.
   The longer Czechoslovakia remains adrift in its
constitutional void the greater the danger to all the good
that it has achieved and to its great future potential.
(Voters also go to the polls this weekend in Bulgaria, a
country whose long road to recovery is suggested by the fact
that, unique among East European countries today, one still
sees the Soviet flag flying.)
   Whether a consensus can be reached in Czechoslovakia on
the sovereignty of the state hinges on the ability of
political leaders at a crucial point in their country's
history to devise a federal structure that recognizes the
authority of the majority, while it extends to nationalities
collective political rights sufficient to satisfy them. Such
an extraordinary achievement would be a first in Eastern
Europe.

   Writing Scores of Private-School Students
   Much Higher Than Public-School Levels

   WASHINGTON -- The federal government's first comparison of
public and private schools shows that private-school students
score significantly higher on tests of writing ability than
those who attend public schools.
   However, the federally financed National Assessment of
Educational Progress characterizes the average writing
ability of students in all schools, public and private, as
"minimal." It says the scores of private-school students,
including those from church-operated schools, were just less
minimal than public-school students' scores.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The agency's latest report on tests administered in 1988
also shows a greater disparity between the writing abilities
of minority and white students than earlier assessments. The
National Assessment was established by Congress to measure
how much students learn in school.
   The report is likely to fuel two current revolts against
traditionally run public schools: One demands greater
parental control of schools and the other seeks to give
parents and students wider choice among schools.
   In several cities, including Chicago and Detroit,
inner-city parents, largely of minorities, have won greater
managerial authority over local schools. Wisconsin has
launched a novel program to allow a limited number of
low-income children in Milwaukee to attend private schools
with public assistance. In addition, some liberals are
joining conservatives in arguing that all students should be
allowed to go to private schools with public assistance if
their parents choose.
   The data from tests of nationwide samples of students
shows that eighth-grade students in private schools
demonstrated greater writing proficiency than 12th graders in
public schools. Looking at the difference in writing scores
between public and private school students, Roy Truby, the
executive director of NAEP's governing board, said, "The gap
between them is substantial." However, he noted that the
writing performance of students in so-called advantaged
public schools, generally those in wealthy suburbs, is equal
to that of private-school students.
   The latest NAEP report on writing skills isn't comparable
with an assessment of writing skills the agency released in
January, which showed a small decrease in the gap between
whites and minorities. NAEP officials said the latest scores
are based on writing tests as much as 30 minutes long, rather
than the 15-minute tests used in other assessments. "The new,
longer format appears to have had the effect of raising the
average performance of white students by increasing the
proportion with adequate or better responses," Mr. Truby
said. "However, it had very little effect on blacks and
Hispanics. . . . As a result, the racial gap appears wider on
the writing exam than on other NAEP assessments."
   The wider gap between whites and minorities on longer
tests could raise ticklish political issues. NAEP is planning
writing tests of as long as 50 minutes for its 1992 writing
assessments. The longer tests are part of an effort to find
better ways to gauge student skills and performance, which
will come under greater scrutiny as the nation measures its
progress toward ambitious educational goals President Bush
and the nation's governors set for the year 2000.
   In explaining the overall poor writing performance, NAEP
noted that students do only a "limited" amount of writing in
school. Only a third of the eighth and 12th graders reported
having to write one or two-page assignments at least once a
week.
   In a companion report on reading performance, the NAEP
said about half the students surveyed in the fourth, eighth
and 12th grades reported reading 10 pages or less a day in
all their courses combined.

   Probably more people could tell you which six states
border Arkansas than could tell you whether the mutual funds
they buy in banks are different from other funds.
   But this ignorance can be costly. While it is possible to
find top-performing mutual funds at banks, many do little
better than passbook savings accounts. There can also be
other pitfalls.

   Banks have been offering stock and bond mutual funds for
only a few years. But more and more of them are getting into
the act these days, lured by lucrative fees and a captive
consumer base.
   "It's a natural addition to their product line," says
Patrick Kennedy, a marketing vice president at Northern Trust
Co. in Chicago. "They have the distribution channels in
place, and they have the image as a more secure organization,
whether right or wrong."
   Lipper Analytical Services Inc. tracks the performance of
435 bank-advised funds, representing $71 billion. That
compares with a mutual fund universe of 2,549 funds, at $1
trillion. Only about 88 of the largest banks actually manage
investments themselves. Other banks without the in-house
resources to manage money often contract with mutual-fund
companies to sell outside funds in bank offices, sometimes
under a bank name, in exchange for a percentage of fees.
   The banks' biggest selling point is convenience. Customers
can purchase mutual funds with the same ease that they buy a
certificate of deposit -- and have the ability to redeem
shares into their checking accounts with a phone call. Some,
including Chase Manhattan Bank, also count the money in
mutual funds toward the minimum balance necessary for free
checking.
   But investors who limit themselves to mutual funds they
find for sale in bank lobbies may be curtailing their choices
unnecessarily. Unless a bank has a brokerage affiliate that
enables depositors to buy "outside" funds, they may have to
settle for a family with six or fewer funds.
   "Investors who want a growth fund, a money market and a
fixed-income fund would be lucky to find that the three
offered by their bank all have better than average returns,"
says Matthew Fink of the Investment Company Institute, a
trade group for the mutual funds industry.
   Further, investors in most cases are limited to funds that
charge sales fees, usually 4.5% to 5%, though a few major
institutions such as Chase and Citibank offer their own
no-load funds. Anyone with the energy to pick up the phone
has access to many top-performing mutual funds that are
available from mutual fund companies without sales fees.
   As for performance, bank officials challenge the
prevailing belief that mutual fund companies are inherently
better at managing money. "One of the myths on Wall Street is
that banks aren't good at managing money," says Gregory
Sanford, a managing director at Security Pacific Corp. in Los
Angeles.
   Since most bank-advised funds are relatively new, they
don't have performance figures available for longer than
three years, which makes long-term performance impossible to
evaluate. But the numbers that are available show that
returns vary widely. Moreover, some of the major bank fund
families include both stellar and mediocre performers.
   "The bottom line is that the performance is generated by
the investment managers, and you have good and bad in
banking, and good and bad in outside fund management," says
Stephen Mintos, director of sales and marketing with the
Winsbury Co., a Columbus, Ohio firm that provides mutual fund
services to banks.
   Investors evaluating the performance of a bank-advised
fund should compare it with other funds of its type, such as
growth funds or balanced funds, "regardless of whether it's a
bank fund or a traditional mutual fund," Mr. Mintos says.
   Says Northern Trust's Mr. Kennedy: "Only go with a bank if
you get the type of fund you're looking for, and the
performance."
   Some bank funds have done quite well. Over the past 12
months, for instance, Chase Manhattan's Vista Growth and
Income was up 36.87%, compared with an average of 9.8% for
all growth-and-income mutual funds, according to Lipper
Analytical; Vista Capital Growth was up 10.35%, compared with
11.24% for all growth funds.
   Other bank funds with healthy returns over the past 12
months include Security Pacific's Pacific Horizon Convertible
(up 16.81% vs. 4.48% for all convertible funds) and Banc One
Co.'s Helmsman Income Equity (up 12.22%, compared with 6.85%
for all equity-income funds).
   On the other hand, Citibank's Landmark Growth and Income
was up just 2.08%, far below the 9.8% group average, Lipper's
numbers show.
   Investors who stick with their banks should also know that
the funds available there tend to be smaller than other
mutual funds. "They haven't been around as long, and aren't
marketed nationally," says James McLaughlin, director of
trust and securities for the American Bankers Association.
   Their smaller size may give some bank funds the same
disadvantages all smaller funds typically face, such as being
more difficult to track, and having higher expense ratios,
which can have a negative effect on performance. However,
many banks have been willing to waive some investment
advisory fees until the fund reaches a target size.
   "Read the prospectus to find out what fees they're
waiving, and for how long," says Michael Ryba, product
manager for Columbus, Ohio-based Banc One's Helmsman funds,
which charge no advisory fees on most funds.
   (Finally, for those who've been racking their brains about
geography, the six states bordering Arkansas are -- starting
to the north and moving clockwise -- Missouri, Tennessee,
Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma.)

         How Some Bank-Advised Mutual Funds Compare
                                                                                                       

   Bank mutual-fund families typically include money-market,
growth-stock and fixed-income funds; some also include such
other offerings as aggressive-growth, growth-and-income,
balanced and international funds. Most bank fund families
offer telephone switching and redemptions, and fund
investments are sometimes counted toward balances required
for no-fee checking.

   House Overrides
   President's Veto
   Of Amtrak Bill

   WASHINGTON -- The House voted to override President Bush's
veto of an Amtrak authorization bill, moving the issue to the
Senate, where the administration was struggling to find the
votes it needed to uphold the veto.
   In a 294-123 vote, the House brushed aside administration
complaints that one provision of the bill, which authorizes
$2 billion over three years for Amtrak, represents
reregulation of the railroad industry. The Senate is expected
to vote next week.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After the House action, Senate Democrats yesterday pushed
for a quick vote, saying they were reasonably confident that
they had the necessary two-thirds majority to override the
veto. But Minority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas objected,
noting that some Republican senators were absent because of
health reasons or family obligations. "We can't do the best
we can with five absentees," he said.
   President Bush has turned back 10 bills, not counting the
Amtrak bill, and so far Congress has failed to override any
of the vetoes. In January, the House rejected his veto of
legislation protecting Chinese exchange students from
deportation, but the Senate upheld the veto.
   In vetoing the Amtrak bill May 24, President Bush
criticized as an unwarranted "regulatory burden" a
requirement that the Interstate Commerce Commission review
proposed acquisitions of major freight railroads by non-rail
companies.
   But some members of Congress believe that Mr. Bush objects
to the federal subsidies in the Amtrak bill, even though
administration officials have said that the president would
sign the legislation if it were stripped of the ICC-review
requirement. House Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois
introduced such a measure yesterday.
   A White House spokesman yesterday said, "We're
disappointed by the House vote. The president supports the
Amtrak bill without the ICC provisions."
   During debate on the House floor, Rep. Thomas Tauke (R.,
Iowa), defended the provision, saying, "To say that this is
reregulation of the railroads is just mind-blowing." He noted
that the ICC already has wide authority to review financial
transactions involving railroads and contended that the
disputed provision would simply close a loophole.
   The administration, in recent days, has turned up the
lobbying heat, with mixed results. President Bush called Sen.
Mark Hatfield (R., Ore.) to ask for his support, but Mr.
Hatfield is still undecided. On Tuesday, in a meeting with
Republican senators, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
argued that rail deregulation would be threatened by the
Amtrak bill and pressed for support for the administration.
But the talk deteriorated into a rambling session on airline
deregulation, with several senators voicing complaints.
   Those opposing the president may benefit from Amtrak's
popularity among urban senators of both parties. Moreover,
some senators from rural states have deep concerns about any
corporate takeovers which could threaten rail links to farms.
And though Mr. Dole is counted as loyal to the president on
this issue, some of those closest to him, like Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum (R. Kan.), are opposed to the president's veto.
   Some senators, like freshman Dan Coats (R., Ind.) are
caught in the middle. Sen. Coats, who replaced Vice President
Quayle in the Senate, normally could be expected to support
the White House. But a large number of Amtrak employees, who
are lobbying heavily for the override, live in Indiana. For
now, said an aide, the senator "is completely undecided."
   Because of previous congressional appropriations, the veto
battle, whatever its outcome, isn't expected to affect Amtrak
operations anytime soon.

   Education:
   Colleges Find
   Fewer Freshmen
   To Go Around

   A number of universities are reporting a sharp decline in
the size of this year's freshman classes, signaling the start
of a demographic slide that educators have been dreading for
years.
   The drop-off could put even greater pressure on rising
tuitions, as universities struggle to spread fixed costs
among fewer students. It could also lead to belt-tightening
and staff layoffs, which generally have been avoided despite
a decline in numbers among the college-age population.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With fewer high school seniors graduating this spring,
many schools are accepting record numbers of students off
waiting lists, while others have extended their application
deadlines from February until as late as August, all in
attempts to salvage pinched budgets.
   "We think demographics are a major factor in all this,"
says David Smith, dean of admissions and financial aid at
Syracuse University in New York, where the incoming freshman
class is expected to drop about 6.4%. But there are other
factors, he says. "Cost is an issue, and so is the general
state of the economy."
   Northeastern University, in Boston, expects 3,000 freshmen
in the fall, 19% fewer than last year, prompting the school
to consider freezing faculty hiring and salary hikes. Oberlin
College, in Ohio, is predicting that about 670 freshmen will
attend, about 21% fewer than a year ago, while the Illinois
Institute of Technology, in Chicago, expects 20% fewer
freshmen, or about 328.
   Some schools, such as Colgate University in New York and
Pepperdine University in California, are expecting larger
freshman classes next year, buoyed by better recruitment
efforts or a surplus of applications. But some of these
increases follow declines last year, and several admissions
officers predict the overall tally this year will be down.
   "The general trend is that people are looking at smaller
freshman classes," says William Conley, dean of undergraduate
admissions at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio.
   The trend is affecting both private and public schools.
Michael Barron, director of admissions at the University of
Iowa, says he expects fewer freshmen overall in the large Big
Ten public universities. At Iowa, Mr. Barron expects about
3,162 freshmen next year, a 10% decline.
   The decline in high school graduates has had a lesser
impact on top-tier schools such as Yale University or
Stanford University because applications far exceed available
freshman seats. Still, even the Ivy League's Brown University
expects a decline in incoming freshmen of about 3%. Some
educators contend that the Ivy League and comparable schools
went deeper into their waiting lists this year.
   Educators also say that strong students were accepted by
schools they never expected to get into early in the season.
"This year by June 1, the gig was up. Students knew all of
their options and their options were very good," says Case
Western's Mr. Conley. "In the past, there was some hope of
picking up some stragglers over the summer. This year, we're
not going to see that ebb and flow."
   With numbers down, many schools will face declining
revenue, says John Rouhoniemi, director of admissions at
Saint Olaf College, in Northfield, Minn. "The schools that
are really in trouble are those with small endowments or an
operating budget totally driven by student tuition," he says.
   Because the number of high school graduates isn't expected
to reach last year's level of 2.7 million again until 1997,
many schools may be forced to lay off staff, defer
maintenance and freeze salaries.
   "We're looking to the future with a certain apprehension,"
concedes Mr. Smith of Syracuse. "We see a situation that's
wobbling nationally."

   Poland Gets Approval
   For $250 Million Loan

   WASHINGTON -- The World Bank approved a $250 million loan
to Poland to increase natural-gas production and reduce the
country's dependence on coal.
   The bank said its loan will help finance rehabilitation of
existing gas fields and expansion of gas-transmission and
storage facilities. The European Investment Bank also will
provide Poland with a $60 million credit for the same
projects, World Bank officials said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "As Poland moves toward a market economy, demand for gas
and oil is expected to increase, while demand for coal, which
produces large quantities of air pollution, is expected to
decrease," the World Bank said.
   The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, jointly
financed by the World Bank and the United Nations Development
Program, will provide Poland with technical assistance on
pricing gas and setting up a contractual framework to expand
the country's petroleum industry through foreign and domestic
private-sector enterprises.
   In other actions, the World Bank cleared a $190 million
loan to Indonesia to improve public-water-supply facilities
in the Jakarta region, while the International Development
Association, a bank affiliate, approved a $175 million credit
to Bangladesh to strengthen the country's banking and
financial system.
   The bank also approved a $50 million loan to Papua New
Guinea to support economic reforms and help maintain
financial stability in the wake of the closing of the
country's main gold and copper mine.
   In addition, the bank cleared a $32 million loan to
Algeria and a $17 million loan to Tunisia to help finance
agricultural research.
   The World Bank loans will be at variable interest rates,
currently 7.75% a year; the IDA credit to Bangladesh will be
interest-free but will involve administrative fees.
