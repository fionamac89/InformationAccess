   Technology:
   Texas Instruments
   To Introduce New
   Laptop Computer

   DALLAS -- Texas Instruments Inc., continuing its effort to
ease back into the personal computer market after an absence
of nearly a decade, will today introduce its entry into the
crowded field of so-called "notebook" personal computers.
   The TravelMate 2000, to be introduced at the annual PC
Expo trade show in New York, is a 4.4-pound notebook-sized
laptop computer that measures 8.5 inches by 11 inches and is
just 1.4 inches thick. The machine runs on an Intel 80C286
microprocessor, has a 20 megabyte hard disk drive, has a
rechargeable, nickel cadmium battery that will run for two
hours, an optional battery pack that will extend operating
time to five hours, and will retail at $3,999.

   Having survived a disastrous plunge into the personal
computer market in the early 1980s, Texas Instruments
returned to the business last fall with three laptop
computers. But those machines were market followers. With the
TravelMate 2000, which the company claims is the thinnest and
lightest of the notebooks that run on the 286 chips, Texas
Instruments hopes to get a leadership position.
   But it won't be easy to gain or maintain a leading
position in the competitive new market for notebooks. The
field has gotten crowded with formidable competitors such as
Compaq Computer Corp. and NEC Corp. And the technology is
advancing rapidly.
   Also to be unveiled at PC Expo, for example, is a notebook
designed by Airis Computer Corp. that weighs 6.5 pounds, runs
an Intel 80C286 microprocessor and has a 20-megabyte hard
disk drive. But the Airis machine runs on C batteries, rather
than the heavy and expensive rechargeable batteries now in
general use, and will retail for only $1,899 -- roughly half
of what Texas Instruments, Compaq Computer Corp. and
virtually every other manufacturer is charging for a
comparable machine. Some analysts, however, question whether
the Chicago-based start-up company will have the resources to
mass produce the machine in a reasonable amount of time.
   Faced with such formidable competition and chastened by
its earlier failure, Texas Instruments is trying to share the
risks and costs with other computer resellers. The company
manufactures a virtually identical machine that was recently
introduced by Sharp Corp.
   The machine being introduced today will be marketed under
the Texas Instruments label. But unlike many of the competing
notebooks, the TravelMate is being targeted primarily for
business users and won't generally be available at
consumer-oriented retail stores.

   WASHINGTON -- Major industrial nations are close to
agreement on a new set of international rules to remove
trade-related restrictions on private direct-investment flows
from one country to another.
   But a group of Third World nations, led by India, Brazil
and Egypt, is balking over accepting such an accord during
the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations in Geneva.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The U.S., European Community and Japan have conceded that
developing nations need a longer transitional period than the
industrial nations to get rid of "domestic-content"
requirements and other laws and regulations that impede
direct private-investment inflows.
   This debate continues among member countries of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade even as barriers to
international investment flows are coming down all over the
world.
   Moreover, spokesmen for Third World countries are
expressing concern that many countries in Latin America, Asia
and Africa may be left behind as multinational corporations,
commercial bankers and international lending agencies
concentrate on the urgent needs of Eastern and Central
European countries for loans and private investment to
support their economic reforms.
   By late July, governments participating in the Geneva
trade negotiations are supposed to complete the basic
outlines of a big package of new agreements to liberalize
world trade, so that these accords can be completed by the
end of this year.
   GATT officials and others are confident that an agreement
to eliminate trade-related international investment
restrictions will be approved this year, although there are
serious questions to be resolved among major nations and
developing countries on agricultural-trade reforms, textiles
and other issues.
                                                                                                       

   U.S. "Open-Door" Investment Policy: Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady and others in Washington maintain that the
U.S. market is wide open to foreign investments.
   Yet there is considerable sentiment in Congress for
closing this door a bit on a case-by-case basis.
   Recently, the House voted to relax antitrust laws for U.S.
companies undertaking joint manufacturing as well as
research-and-development ventures, but not for any U.S.
company controlled 30% or more by foreign investors.
   The Bush administration favors the thrust of the
legislation but not the discrimination against U.S.
affiliates of foreign companies, according to Treasury
Department officials.
   The Senate soon may consider a similar bill to ease
antitrust laws without discriminating against foreign
investors. It's uncertain, however, whether any such
legislation will reach the enactment stage this year.
   Also pending on Capitol Hill is a proposal that would
allow the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis
to tap the "confidential" data banks of other government
units to help pull together a clearer statistical picture of
foreign investment in various segments of the U.S. economy.
This legislation wouldn't put any new reporting burdens on
foreign-controlled companies and therefore is considered to
be relatively noncontroversial.
                                                                                                       

   Hills Shelves Trade Sanctions: U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills says India's restrictions on U.S. investors and
insurance companies, which can't do business in that country,
are "unreasonable."
   But she says it would be "inappropriate" for the U.S. to
impose economic sanctions on India under the "Super-301"
provisions of the 1988 Trade Act because of the continuing
negotiations in world trade talks in Geneva to remove
government restrictions on investments and services.
   She warned last week, however, that the U.S. could relight
the fuse on this "Super-301" trade complaint if such action
is "warranted" after the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations is completed late this year.
                                                                                                       

   British, Japanese Investors: According to the Commerce
Department, British and Japanese companies were the leading
foreign investors in the U.S. last year in establishing or
acquiring U.S. companies.
   The total for such direct investment from all foreign
countries was about $64.6 billion. British investors
accounted for about $22 billion; Japan ranked second with
about $14.9 billion.
   The Commerce Department says the Japanese have been
investing in various manufacturing companies and U.S. real
estate. By the end of last year, the report adds, most big
U.S. producers of steel "had embarked upon at least one joint
venture with a Japanese steel manufacturer."
                                                                                                       

   Australia Gets a Seat at the Table: What used to be known
as the "Quad" group of agricultural ministers, representing
the U.S., Canada, Japan and the EC in discussions of
international trade issues, is now known as the "Quint."
   Australia joined this group late last year.
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says the second
meeting of the "Quint" group will be held in Ireland at the
end of next month.
   Australia and Canada also are participants in the
so-called Cairns group, a larger group of countries that are
important exporters of agricultural products. They would like
to see reductions in the agricultural-export subsidies of the
U.S. and the EC.
                                                                                                       

   Vietnam Opening: President Bush is being urged by some
business leaders to lift U.S. economic sanctions on Vietnam.
   Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce told the White
House that U.S. rules barring trade with Vietnam are "no

companies doing business in Asia.
   On Cuba, which also has long been cut off from normal
trade relations with the U.S., Mr. Bush has said that he
isn't ready to consider changes in the economic sanctions
against that country.

   Pathe Extends
   Tender Offer
   For MGM/UA

   LOS ANGELES -- Pathe Communications Corp. said it extended
the expiration date of its $1.2 billion tender offer for
MGM/UA Communications Co. by another week. The offer now
expires Friday.
   Pathe Communications's $20-a-share offer, launched last
March, has already been extended several times, and this
latest delay was expected. The originally agreed-upon
"drop-dead" date is June 23. However, "if all parties agree,
it's possible" there could be another extension, a Pathe
Communications spokesman said. An MGM/UA representative said,
"additional discussions would have to be scheduled" if Pathe
Communications asked for more time.

   Time Warner Inc. has agreed to lend Pathe Communications
$650 million toward the transaction in exchange for certain
distribution rights to its films and a security interest in
the valuable United Artists film library. Pathe
Communications has indicated it won't meet all the terms of
its agreement with Time Warner, but Time Warner has already
made one concession and discussions are continuing about
more. Despite the complexity of Pathe Communications's
financing and the fact that Pathe Communications principal
Giancarlo Parretti is appealing a prison sentence in Italy
for fraudulent bankruptcy, Time Warner is believed to be
anxious to see the transaction completed.
   Pathe Communications last week revealed that it is raising
about $368 million from a variety of European asset sales and
bank loans. The company has already deposited $200 million in
cash as a down payment.
   MGM/UA shares closed Friday at 18.625, down 37.5 cents, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Separately, Mr. Parretti suffered another blow as France's
Finance Ministry, citing a threat to "public order," blocked
his latest effort to take over Pathe Cinema.
   Mr. Parretti's Paris representatives said they would fight
the French move.
   The government decision doesn't have any direct impact on
Mr. Parretti's main holdings, which are grouped in Pathe
Communications. Despite the similar names, Pathe
Communications and Pathe Cinema aren't legally related.

   HELSINKI -- Finland's annual inflation rate remained at
6.2% in May, unchanged from the previous month, the Central
Statistical Office said.
   The biggest increase during the past 12 months has been
housing, at 11%. The smallest increase, 3.6%, was in food
prices, the statistics agency said.

   Baby Bells to Work
   On Phone Network
   For Czechoslovakia

   Bell Atlantic Corp. and U S West Inc. said they were
selected to form a joint venture with Czechoslovakia's
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to build and operate
a cellular telephone network.
   Under the arrangement, the Czech ministry will own 51%,
and the two regional Bells together will own 49%. Bell
Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, and U S West, based in
Denver, said they expect to invest about $60 million over 10
years to develop the analog cellular network for the Eastern
European country. Both companies view the award as a
strategic victory.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As part of the agreement, the companies will have
long-term opportunities to help the Czech ministry upgrade
the country's telephone system. Even the cellular system they
are planning is likely to be upgraded at some point in the
future because most of Europe already has adopted a digital
standard.
   Czechoslovakia has a population of about 15.5 million and
about 2.2 million telephone lines. Czechoslovakia's serious
need for more and better phone service "warrants our
attention," a U S West spokesman said. "As an example, there
are about 300,000 pending orders for service in
Czechoslovakia that cannot be accommodated by the present
wire-line system."
   Construction on the cellular network is expected to begin
in the third quarter, with service starting in mid-1991. A
Bell Atlantic spokesman said his company and U S West expect
to pay for design, construction and operating costs of the
venture with hard currency, while wages would be paid in
local currency.
   Steven Andrews, president of U S West's international
unit, said the Czech award and the cellular network that U S
West is already building in Hungary provide "a firm base"
from which to develop "a wireless network serving Eastern
European customers."
   For Bell Atlantic, the agreement was its second
international victory in a week and its first successful bid
in Europe, a market all seven regional Bell companies are
eager to enter. Bell Atlantic views the cellular award as a
foot in the door. "This is hardly the end of it," a Bell
Atlantic spokesman said.
   On Wednesday, Bell Atlantic announced that it, along with
Ameritech, had been selected to buy New Zealand's state-owned
telephone system. Two New Zealand companies, the Freightways
Holdings Ltd. conglomerate and Fay, Richwhite Holdings Ltd.
merchant bank, also will have a small share.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Bell
Atlantic closed at $51.125 a share, down 62.5 cents. U S West
finished at $37.875, up 37.5 cents.

   Economy:
   Factory Output
   Climbed 0.6%
   During May

   Consumer Prices Rose 0.2%;
   Economy Is Said to Be
   In a Slow-Growth Rut

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy continues to show little
luster, with slow growth and steady inflation.
   Friday's economic data gave some cause for optimism. The
Federal Reserve reported that a rebound in auto production
pushed factory output up 0.6% in May. And the Labor
Department said consumer prices rose a modest 0.2% in the
same month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But in the wake of Wednesday's dismal retail-sales report,
economists say the latest data only confirm that the economy
is stuck in a slow-growth rut.
   "Friday's numbers offer some hope that activity in the
manufacturing sector is at the very least stabilizing, and
perhaps improving," said Norman Robertson, chief economist
for Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "But that comes at a time when
activity in almost every other sector is showing signs of
weakness. Putting it all together, it's very hard to see
anything much better than an economic growth rate in the 1%
to 2% range."
   The slow growth in consumer prices during May provided
little reason to fear that inflation is accelerating. But the
report also offered little evidence that the rate of
inflation is coming down.
   "Year over year, excluding food and energy, you are still
dealing with 4.8% core inflation," said Lyle Gramley, chief
economist for the Mortgage Bankers' Association and a former
Federal Reserve Board governor. "Inflation has been
contained, but there hasn't been an outright reduction."
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers, said the latest figures are in line with
the administration's expectations. "As we said last year, we
expected the economy to grow more slowly in late '89 and
early '90, and that is indeed what is happening," he said.
The administration believes "the economy will do better in
the second half of this year," Mr. Boskin said.
   Privately, administration officials have been hoping the
Federal Reserve would give a boost to the economy by easing
credit and bringing down short-term interest rates. But with
few signs of a recession, and with inflation unchanged, the
Fed is unlikely to change its policy soon. Fed officials say
that before easing, they would like to see convincing
evidence that the inflation rate has started to drop.
   "The only way to keep inflation under control is to keep a
tight rein on the economy," said Robert Ortner, former
Commerce Department undersecretary and author of the book
"Voodoo Deficits." Referring to the Fed chairman, he added:
"Alan Greenspan's job is to promote a healthy economy; it is
not to get George Bush re-elected."
   May's rise in industrial production followed a month in
which factory output, according to revised estimates, was
unchanged. The Fed initially reported a 0.4% drop in output
in April. Most of the rise in May was in motor vehicles and
parts. Excluding those, production rose only 0.2% from the
previous month.
   The rise in production brought the operating rate at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities to 83.6% in May, up
from 83.3% in April.
   May's 0.2% rise in consumer prices was the same as April's
increase, but it followed a string of much bigger jumps in
the first three months of this year. Prices in May were 4.4%
above their level during the same 1989 month.
   Medical care costs showed the biggest increase in the
month, while prices for gasoline and apparel dropped.
Excluding food and energy prices, which are volatile, prices
rose 0.3% in May.
   The Labor Department also reported that the average weekly
earnings of nonsupervisory workers rose 0.3% in May, after
accounting for inflation. That followed a 0.2% rise in April.
During the past year, earnings have fallen a steep 1.8% after
inflation.
   All the figures are adjusted for predictable seasonable
variations.

   The Outlook:
   Big U.S. Banks Need
   Much Greater Latitude

   WASHINGTON -- Hoary complaints that economists can't agree
on anything weren't borne out at a recent conference
sponsored here by the American Enterprise Institute.
Discussing "International Competitiveness in Financial
Services," most of the participants agreed on a lot.
   They agreed that the internationalization of finance is
likely to grow even more rapidly in the 1990s than in the
1980s. That strong, highly competitive banks are essential to
strong, highly competitive manufacturing. And that if the
U.S. doesn't modernize its regulatory policies, it may
regulate its big banks into an ever-weaker position.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The AEI conference also turned up little dispute about
what ails U.S. banks: the relatively high costs of capital
and the steep rates they must pay on deposits; the
perhaps-excessive regulatory reports and reserve requirements
demanded of them; their own penchant for making bad loans,
and, perhaps most of all, the limits on the regions and
businesses they may enter.
                                                                                                       

   "We have financial institutions that aren't allowed to
exploit their expertise," complained David W. Mullins Jr.,
the recently appointed member of the Federal Reserve Board.
                                                                                                       

   Undoubtedly, restrictions on geographical expansion have
done much to push American banks far down on the lists of the
world's banking giants. In contrast to other countries'
liberal statutes, American antitrust and anti-branching laws
have long barred the creation of nationwide banks.
   Consequently, "no U.S. banking organization reflects the
economic strength of our country as a whole," Rep. John J.
LaFalce, a New York Democrat who sits on the House Banking
Committee, told the AEI conference. "Continuing limitations
on interstate operations preclude some of our institutions
from accumulating the critical mass" to help them expand into
other markets.
   However, size alone doesn't guarantee global power; some
huge foreign banks are almost exclusively domestic. And
George J. Benston of Emory University attributed "the
dominant current position of the Japanese banks" largely to
Japan's rapid economic growth. He added that measures of
deposit totals ignore "banks' ability to lend or offer
services to customers."
                                                                                                       

   It is that very ability that is being weakened by the
product-line restrictions. At a time when American banks have
already lost many large corporate customers to the
direct-loan market, such restrictions may become the most
serious handicap hobbling U.S. institutions in the 1990s.
                                                                                                       

   "Legal prohibitions that prevent U.S. banks from offering
their customers complete securities and insurance
underwriting and sales," Prof. Benston said, "reduce those
banks' ability to serve their customers and to diversify
their activities. As a result, U.S. banks are somewhat less
profitable and possibly more risky than they would be in the
absence of these restrictions."
   Despite the prohibitions, Prof. Benston noted, U.S. banks
are highly innovative, especially with regard to
off-balance-sheet activities. He cited their role "in
developing interest and foreign-exchange rate swaps, futures,
and options for customers to allow them to deal with the
increasing variability of interest rates and other prices."
   During the 1990s, he said, U.S. banks' European
subsidiaries "will be able to offer the same services as EEC
banks even though their U.S. branches and subsidiaries must
conform to more restrictive U.S. laws. But because the
Glass-Steagall Act and other laws prohibit most U.S. banks
from being directly involved in such activities as corporate
securities underwriting, insurance and real estate, U.S.
bankers may lack the skills to compete effectively."
                                                                                                       

   Acknowledging that "U.S. banks have lost some competitive
edge to foreign competitors," Kathleen B. Cooper, the chief
economist at Security Pacific National Bank, observed that
it's hard to introduce new products abroad if you can't learn
how at home. "If U.S. banks don't get a broader range of
products, they will no longer be the most innovative," she
added.
                                                                                                       

   Although some AEI speakers forecast nationwide banking
within 10 years, there is some doubt that it will come soon
enough to keep foreign banks from gaining devastating
advantages over their U.S. competitors.
   Describing the U.S. as "lurching ineffectively" toward
reform, Rep. LaFalce stated, "Barriers to interstate banking
are gradually falling, and U.S. banks are gradually being
allowed to make limited forays into the securities business.
But the changes we are seeing are not part of a long-term
strategic plan designed to ensure the competitive strength of
our financial-services sector."
   Those changes are coming mostly through moves by
regulatory agencies and state legislators. But, arguing that
"piecemeal reform" led to the S&amp;L mess, Mr. Mullins said,
"Reforms should be comprehensive." Also criticizing the
reforms to date, Willard C. Butcher, chief executive of Chase
Manhattan, attacked the currently required "rigid firewalls"
within bank holding companies. Rather than preventing
problems, he said, they can endanger troubled operating units
and reduce service to customers.
   "Despite years of debate on financial-institutions
reform," Rep. LaFalce complained, "neither the administration
nor the Congress has made the issue the top priority it
deserves to be." With elections looming, he does "not expect
that we will see any significant legislation on this issue in
this congressional session." But he said the prospects in the
next Congress "are growing stronger with each passing day,"
and he added, "We dare not wait too long -- 1991 must be the
year]"

   If you're looking for a rustic summer vacation, West
Virginia has a few vacancies these days.
   That's because the Mountain State got cut from a "Third
World in the U.S." tour of Appalachia. The reason: West
Virginia is too remote, even for this tour.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Global Exchange, the San Francisco group that organized
the tour, says it would take too long to get to West
Virginia. Besides, local officials weren't exactly receptive
to a group that compares their state to the Third World.
   "If they're looking for the Third World, they don't have
to leave the state of California," grouses John H. Brown Jr.,
West Virginia's commissioner of tourism and parks. "They've
got more poor people in the barrios of Los Angeles than we
have in the whole state."
   West Virginia officials suggested that the group skip the
southern coal fields, a depressed region, and focus on the
state's scenic charms: lakes, mountains and golf courses.
"They suggested we come and go white-water rafting," says
Laurie Adams, tour planner.
   No dice. These are reality tours, says Ms. Adams. So the
10-day trip, which began yesterday, will skip West Virginia
and focus on Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. Nine people,
including a teacher, a convention planner and a film maker,
have signed up for the $500 excursion to coal mines, farms
and rural households.
   So West Virginia feels a bit left out. "I'm disappointed,"
says Mr. Brown. "I didn't mean to keep them from coming."
   Folks in the states still left on the itinerary express
mixed feelings about the tour. Ms. Adams has received some
nasty letters and irate phone calls from residents who are
fed up with the stereotypes of their mountain communities.
"One person wrote to say she never married her cousin and has
used an outhouse only once," says Ms. Adams.
   For their part, Kentucky officials say they welcome any
visitors to the Bluegrass State. Jim Carroll, a state tourism
spokesman, considers the tour's name offensive, but "we
haven't taken it too seriously."
   Personally, he questions the premise of a so-called
reality tour by these city slickers from the West: "Reality
in San Francisco is an oxymoron," he jokes.
   But Mr. Carroll says Kentucky officials might turn out to
greet the out-of-towners. "We just hope we have enough time
to put on our shoes and kick the pigs out of the yard before
they get here."

   Bush Vetoes Bill
   That Would Relax
   Hatch Act's Curbs

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush vetoed a bill that would ease
restrictions on political activity by federal civil servants,
saying the change would "inevitably lead to repoliticizing
the federal work force."
   Mr. Bush's veto, which was expected, was his 12th since he
took office. All his previous vetoes have been sustained;
most recently, the Senate last week sustained his veto of an
Amtrak authorization bill by two votes. Mr. Bush is also
expected to veto a measure passed by Congress late Thursday
that would guarantee workers as much as 12 weeks' unpaid
leave for childbirth, adoption or serious family illnesses.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In rejecting the measure to lift restrictions on federal
workers' campaign activities, Mr. Bush said the current
system protects workers from harassment and ensures the
integrity and neutrality of the federal work force. Since
1939, the so-called Hatch Act has barred federal workers from
most partisan political activity aside from voting, including
holding partisan political positions or participating in
campaigns. Federal workers can, however, participate in
non-partisan activities such as school board races.
   Labor leaders and representatives from jurisdictions with
a substantial federal work force pressed for the changes,
saying three million federal and postal workers should have
the same rights as other citizens. The changes approved by
Congress last week, by a vote of 334-87 in the House and
67-30 in the Senate, would allow federal and postal workers
to hold positions in the political parties, to attend party
conventions as delegates and to raise money from fellow
members of the same union.
   Although the original votes in both houses were large
enough to override Mr. Bush's veto, GOP leaders have
expressed confidence they can muster the votes in the Senate
to sustain the veto.
   Meanwhile, some Republicans are urging Mr. Bush not to
follow through on his threat to veto the parental-leave bill.
"I would hope the First Father wouldn't make this decision
without first hearing from Republicans who support the bill,"
said Rep. Marge Roukema (R., N.J.). "There are reasons why
business should be concerned about intrusive new mandates,
but this isn't one of them."

   Rate of Inflation
   In Britain Rose
   To 9.7% in May

   LONDON -- Britain's annual rate of inflation rose more
than expected to 9.7% in May from 9.4% in April.
   The so-called underlying rate, which by excluding
mortgage-interest payments and the recently introduced
"community charge" is more comparable with European inflation
measures, rose to 7% from 6.5%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Treasury spokeswoman said the inflation rise, which was
caused by increased food and clothing prices and the residual
impact of higher excise duties on tobacco and alcohol prices,
is "not very welcome."
   Economists warned that the rise in the underlying level
indicates that inflationary pressures are even more
entrenched than expected, and that will make it even more
difficult for the government to achieve the economic
conditions it has set for taking the British pound into the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
   The government has repeatedly said that it won't take that
step until British inflation is down closer to European
levels. Although it remains unclear exactly what inflation
measure the government will use in making its judgment,
Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major has said that an
underlying level will be used.
   Stephen Hannah, head of research at Natwest Capital
Markets, predicted that the underlying inflation rate won't
fall toward European inflation levels until early next year.
"If we take the government at its word," sterling probably
won't be able to join the exchange rate mechanism until the
spring, he said.
   Sterling rose sharply last week on speculation that the
government is considering taking sterling into the mechanism
as early as this autumn, but it slipped back after the
inflation report was released.
   The rise in the annual rate of inflation, as measured by
the retail price index, was higher than the 9.5% average of
economists' forecasts and took the rate back up to its
highest level since March 1982, when it was at 10.4%.
   The 0.5-point increase in the underlying rate took it to
its highest level since October 1982, when it was also at 7%.
   Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co.,
said price rises in clothing and food confirm that the
country is facing continued demand-led inflation. Retail
sales figures last week indicated that consumer spending
remains buoyant despite the government's tight-money policy.

   As Aetna Adds
   Flextime, Bosses
   Learn to Cope

<LP>
   HARTFORD, Conn. -- It's 8 a.m. Monday and Aetna Life &amp;
Casualty Co. employees, once a lockstep army, are marching to
their own tune.
   And the weekly maneuvers begin for managers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A corporate meeting planner arrives to find an employee he
didn't expect to see until Wednesday busily organizing her
desk; she's switched places with her job-sharing partner, who
usually works Mondays. A finance manager calls a department
meeting, then cancels it after realizing two part-timers
won't be in until Tuesday. And a data processing manager
ponders how her department of six will function when three
employees, all expecting babies, take six-week family leaves.
   Faced with a tight labor market, Aetna is rewriting its
rules to give employees more say in when, where and how much
they work. While other companies are beginning to do the
same, Aetna seems to be on the vanguard. And a look at what
the insurer is doing shows some of the benefits and the
pitfalls of breaking away from workweek rigidity.
   The new flexibility means difficult adjustments for
managers. Suddenly they must negotiate an array of work
schedules, supervise "out of sight" subordinates and assuage
traditional nine-to-fivers who may resent their freewheeling
colleagues.
   "You can no longer say `this is the way it's always been
done' and expect that to continue," says Barbara Prescott,
director of health claims. Nearly 40% of her 107 employees
now work "flextime" (adjusting their own starting and
quitting hours), while others work part-time or from home.
"Today's work force is fluid," she notes. "You've got to give
up some control and be open to new ideas -- but also realize
you aren't going to please everyone."
   Daniel Durej, director of financial services-commercial
insurance division, admits "a chill went through me" when a
manager on his staff requested a part-time schedule after the
birth of her second child two years ago. "My first response
was `we can't do it,'" he says. "I thought maybe if we were
standing on an assembly line making widgets it would be
possible, but this is a management job."
   But the alternative -- losing a highly valued employee --
seemed worse. So Mr. Durej offered her a three-day-a-week,
nonmanagement job. Still, he adds, he probably assigned her
too many duties for a part-time schedule, and "she ended up
taking work home a lot, working overtime and feeling
overburdened."
   He, in turn, found himself "stepping in too often" to
absorb some of the load. The solution: putting a layer of
management between himself and the part-timer.
   Despite the snags, Mr. Durej became "less apprehensive"
about flexible scheduling. When a second manager requested a
four-day week after the birth of her third child, he didn't
immediately rule out a management slot. Instead, he polled
her staff, who agreed they'd have no problem working for a
part-time boss. But to ensure that they wouldn't be
overworked, he added one more employee to her staff.
   The biggest fear among managers is that once they say yes
to one employee, everyone will want part-time or job sharing.
After Vin Darcy, a systems supervisor, arranged a three-day
schedule for a woman who was juggling caring for a new baby
and her two elderly parents, he heard "me too" rumblings from
others on his staff. "I called them together and said `you
know you'd have to take a pay cut' if you work fewer days --
and they all backed off," he says.
   Mr. Darcy isn't at all certain he'd offer part-time
equally to everyone. "It takes a very strong person to do
this," he says. Two women on his staff who currently work
compressed weeks "do as much in three days as others do in
five."
   Still, the success of such arrangements has propelled
Aetna to offer employees a medley of options. Some 1,200
employees now work part time, up from 700 a few years ago;
several hundred telecommute from their homes and 65 to 70
work part-time in pairs, sharing one job, one salary and one
set of benefits.
   "We're not doing it to be nice, but because it makes
business sense," says Sherry Herchenroether, manager of
family services. Nearly 70% of Aetna's 45,000 employees are
female, including 17% of the company's managers. Three years
ago, Aetna found that 23% of those who had taken maternity
disability left the company after becoming mothers. A year
later, after introducing a six-month unpaid family leave,
that attrition rate was cut in half.
   The hardest thing to manage is job sharing. "You have to
match the right people together, and you're supervising two
people for the time it would take to supervise one," Ms.
Herchenroether says.
   Sue Yucha and Karen Queno for the past four years have
shared a job arranging conferences for Aetna managers. Each
woman has a distinct style (Ms. Yucha, for instance, admits
she's messy, while Ms. Queno is neat). But the pair, both
mothers of two children, have made it work. They aren't
supervisors, so there isn't the problem of subordinates
answering to two masters. They hash out differences privately
and stay in close touch by phone. Ms. Queno works the first
half of the week, Ms. Yucha the second, and they confer over
lunch on Wednesday.
   Their boss, Paul Rannenberg, acknowledges that he had
initial reservations -- but says he'd now welcome an entire
staff of job sharers. "The synergy you get can be great, and
if one is sick or on vacation, the other is always there."
   At what point is flexible scheduling more trouble than
it's worth? When employees try to take advantage of the
situation, says Ms. Herchenroether. One employee, she says,
arranged a flextime schedule when his parents became ill --
but instead of honoring the new arrangement arrived at work
later and later. Another wanted to work just 20 hours a month
-- not nearly enough to make a contribution.
   But if there's a will, there's usually a way. She recalls
the dilemma faced by a data processing manager when three of
her six staffers, all specialists, became pregnant at the
same time. All three wanted family leaves and part-time
schedules on their return. "The thought of having even one
out was frightening," says Ms. Herchenroether. But the
manager mapped out a plan to cross-train the employees to do
each other's jobs. She also found temporary workers to fill
in during family leaves.
   "The manager said she was bending over backwards to
accommodate everyone because she'd eventually want the same
treatment," says Ms. Herchenroether. And indeed, the manager
became pregnant nine months later and is currently on a
family leave.

   Telecredit, Check-Guarantee Provider,
   Holds Merger Talks With Several Firms

   LOS ANGELES -- Telecredit Inc., a provider of
check-guarantee and credit-card processing services, said
that it is holding talks with several companies about a
possible business combination.
   "Telecredit believes it is in the best interests of its
shareholders to explore the possibility of such a
transaction," said Lee A. Ault III, chairman and chief
executive officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Telecredit told shareholders last year that it was
considering various ways to use its excess cash, including a
stock buy-back, recapitalization or leveraged buy-out. After
"we were approached by some companies of substance, we
thought we might as well include {a merger} as one of the
alternatives, " Mr. Ault said Friday.
   The announcement propelled Telecredit shares up $9.375 to
$52.50 in national over-the-counter trading. Nearly 1.2
million shares changed hands, more than 25 times the stock's
average daily volume. The closing price gives Telecredit a
market value of about $578 million.
   Telecredit is best known for its check service used by
retailers and other merchants to verify customers' personal
checks. If a check bounces after Telecredit approves it,
Telecredit "purchases" the check from the retailer.
Dominating the market, Telecredit guarantees more than $7
billion of checks annually.
   Credit-card and debit card processing services, mainly for
MasterCard and Visa transactions, make up the other main part
of Telecredit's business. The company's customers are 1,700
credit unions and small and medium-sized financial
institutions that don't process their own credit-card
payments.
   Analysts suggested that Telecredit's suitors probably are
large financial institutions seeking to expand existing
services or add new ones. Most banks wouldn't be interested
because they wouldn't want to reduce their regulatory capital
by putting substantial goodwill on their books, the analysts
said.
   Mr. Ault wouldn't describe the suitors, but he said that
"the only {companies} that make sense would be those where
there is a strategic fit and they have some size to do it."
   The board hasn't set a deadline to review the options, but
the process "won't drag on for a long time," he said.
Telecredit has retained Dillon, Read &amp; Co. and Alex. Brown &amp;
Sons Inc. as financial advisers.
   Telecredit isn't widely followed by securities analysts,
possibly because its niche business doesn't neatly fall into
any large industry group. Joseph A. Stieven, an analyst at
Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co. in St. Louis, counseled clients Friday
to "take profits" because the stock "could drop as quickly as
it came up" if a transaction doesn't materialize.
   Mr. Stieven, who has followed Telecredit for four years,
praises management for achieving pretax profit margins of 27%
for the nine months ended Jan. 31. After more than 20 years
at the helm, Telecredit's 53-year-old chief executive, Mr.
Ault, "is highly energetic and has sharp people working for
him."
   One of Telecredit's attractions is that it throws off a
lot of cash. The company currently has about $82 million, or
$7 a share, in cash and no debt. While earnings growth has
slowed a bit in recent years, analysts are forecasting future
growth of about 13% to 15% a year.
   Telecredit was hurt in recent years by the disappointing
performance of a subsidiary that launched a computerized
system to prevent counterfeiting of stocks and bonds. The
unit, most of whose operations have been phased out,
accounted for $38 million in operating losses in fiscal years
1984 through 1988, one analyst calculated.
   In the year ended April 30, 1989, Telecredit posted net
income of $24.9 million, or $2.26 a share, on revenue of
$158.7 million. For the nine months ended Jan. 31, the
company had net income of $21.9 million, or $1.98 a share, on
revenue of $129.2 million.

   PEND OREILLE COUNTY., Wash. -- "For Us, Every Day is Earth
Day," Plum Creek Timber Co. assured the Pacific Northwest in
an advertisement last April. Depicting a forester tenderly
planting a seedling, the ad concluded: "Our Roots are Here."
   But so are its stumps -- which may prove to be the
company's most enduring legacy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   From the green mountain walls of western Montana to the
misty Cascades of central Washington, Plum Creek is
chainsawing a trail of profits and cut-over forests across
the Pacific Northwest. It is rapidly felling old-growth
forests, including trees that predate this nation by a
century or more. It has cut to the very banks of pristine
trout streams. It has bulldozed a road into one de facto
wilderness area and threatened to do the same to another.
   The land it is doing this to is its own, part of a 1.4
million-acre forest empire that was a gift from President
Abraham Lincoln himself. Nevertheless, Plum Creek, a publicly
held limited partnership spun off from Burlington Northern
Inc., has become one of the Pacific Northwest's most
controversial corporate citizens. By its own figures, the
company has been logging the forest Lincoln gave away at
perhaps twice the rate it can regenerate itself.
   "Within the industry, they're considered the Darth Vader
of the state of Washington," says Rep. Rod Chandler,
Republican of Washington, who is drafting more-restrictive
federal legislation covering private logging. "And I think
they've earned it."
   What is unfolding here is a case study in the public costs
of private decisions. It also demonstrates how a board-room
effort to maximize shareholder values can leave an enduring
mark upon the land -- and, some fear, perhaps contribute to
an economically crippling regional timber shortage in future
decades.
   Plum Creek's "only concern," charged an angry Idaho Gov.
Cecil Andrus after personally photographing a company
clear-cut in 1987, "appears to be cashing out their equity at
everyone else's expense."
   Plum Creek has grown accustomed to such talk. "There's no
question -- we can't deny the fact -- that we have a bad
image," says David Leland, president and chief executive
officer. He corrects himself: "Have had a bad image." He says
the company is reforesting its cut-over lands and argues it
has "tried to be good neighbors to the citizens who live
around us." He thinks the solution may lie in "more
professional publicity work," a better job of letting people
know "what we're doing and how we're going about doing it."
   Yet what Plum Creek does, and how it does it, has a way of
startling people.
   Last year it jolted Bozeman, Mont., by announcing plans to
log in South Cottonwood Canyon, an old-growth forest
treasured by hikers and hunters. Responding to anguished
citizens, Congress rushed through a $1 million
land-acquisition appropriation. But Plum Creek is holding out
for more. It now talks of bulldozing roads this summer.
Negotiations continue.
   Plum Creek also jolted northern Idaho last year by
bulldozing a logging road into prime elk habitat proposed by
both Gov. Andrus and Idaho GOP Sen. James McClure as a
special management area. After a furor, Plum Creek sold
12,055 acres for eventual exchange to the state fish and game
department. But the company continues to ask $1 million --
too much, environmentalists protest -- for the timber rights
on one key 640-acre tract. Logging there, at the headwaters
of an unspoiled trout stream, remains a possibility.
   Even what Plum Creek says, and the way it says it, also
has a way of unsettling people.
   Late last year, Rocky Mountain Regional operations
director Bill Parson spoke to the issue of "sustained-yield
forestry," in which forests are logged no faster than they
can regenerate themselves. On a company-sponsored tour of
Plum Creek operations, Mr. Parson told a Montana state
legislator: "We have never said we were on a sustained-yield
program, and we have never been on a sustained-yield program.
Let's get to the heart of it. Sure, it's extensively logged,
but what is wrong with that?" The company doesn't deny the
remarks, but CEO Leland says they are "not an accurate
statement" of company philosophy.
   Plum Creek's accelerated logging dates back to the early
1980s. One driving force is a voracious demand from Japan,
particularly for huge logs from ancient groves; the
beautifully grained wood looks exquisite in exposed-wood
construction. But increasing logging profits was part of a
larger Burlington Northern strategy, conceived in an era of
hostile takeovers, to boost shareholder values.
   Richard M. Bressler, chairman of both Burlington Northern
and Plum Creek, says Wall Street regarded Burlington Northern
as a stodgy railroad company, undervaluing its gas, oil and
timber holdings. "I was concerned that if we didn't do
something about that, somebody else would see those values .
. . and would do something to make those values known," he
says. "So that's when the scheme was hatched to separate the
business into its component parts."
   Thus, in 1988 Burlington Northern spun off Burlington
Resources Inc., an energy and natural-resources concern. A
year later, Plum Creek Timber was spun off as a limited
partnership. The spinoffs increased shareholder values by
"several billion dollars," says Mr. Bressler. Plum Creek also
loaded itself with $325 million in debt, another takeover
deterrent.
   Although little known nationally, Plum Creek is
intertwined with the nation's history. It is named for the
site of its first lumber mill, the Minnesota creek
immortalized by Laura Ingalls Wilder, author of "Little House
on the Prairie" and "On the Banks of Plum Creek." Today the
company is, after Weyerhaeuser Co., the Northwest's largest
timber owner.
   Its economic cornerstone is a framed document on the wall
of its corporate suites, signed "A Lincoln, Dec. 29, 1864."
Amid the Civil War, Mr. Lincoln granted the country's
railroads vast tracts of land as incentive to build lines to
the Pacific. A large share went to the railroads eventually
absorbed into today's Burlington Northern.
   For more than a century, Mr. Lincoln's timber grants were
treated as something of an afterthought. Even today,
volunteers Mr. Bressler, "I don't know anything about trees,
particularly."
   But buried within the land-grant document were always the
seeds of massive ecological disruption. The government
parceled out the lands to the railroads in corridors of
checkerboard squares, each square about three-fourths the
size of New York's Central Park. The railroads typically were
given every other square. Now the checkerboard on the map is
turning into ugly reality on the ground.
   A case in point is a company clear-cut here in the
mountains of northeastern Washington. Straight-edged as an
Iowa cornfield, oblivious to topography, the clear-cut runs
right up to the edge of a U.S. Forest Service square. On the
Forest Service side is a sweet-scented stand of cedar and
spruce, the ground springy with moss and the detritus of
decades. On the Plum Creek side is a desolation of stumps,
water-filled skid marks and roads that encoil the
mountainsides. Discarded beer cans litter the boundary
itself; an official Forest Service marker lies toppled in the
mud.
   "This is an accounting decision, not a forestry decision,"
charges John Osborn, a doctor and environmentalist who has
spearheaded the fight against accelerated logging. His fear:
"Plum Creek has already overcut their corporate forests. Now
they'll use their financial clout to {outbid others and}
overcut the public forests." The eventual losers, he
predicts, will be small sawmills and timber-dependent towns.
   Rep. Chandler shares that fear, foreseeing a timber
shortage that will approximately halve the next generation of
millerloggers. "I grew up in the kind of area where the dream
was to graduate from high school and own a logging truck," he
says. "I see a lot of dreams being smashed by what I consider
some pretty shortsighted decisions by private industry."
   The spreading blotches of logged-over land come at a
pivotal moment in Northwestern logging. "The timber wars,"
some call it. The leading protagonists in this multi-front
war seem alike only in their utter commitment to opposing
views.
   Environmentalist Osborn, who coordinates the Inland Empire
Public Lands Council, is a man driven by the ecological
destruction he sees all around him. His Spokane living room
resembles a military command post. Maps wallpaper every wall;
papers blanket the floor. Stuck to a file box is a one-word
sign: "Bugged." It is a warning to himself -- perhaps
unwarranted, he concedes -- not to trust the security of his
own phone lines.
   "We're kind of in the belly of the beast here," he says.
"The levels of intimidation are very high." Asked if he's
been threatened himself, his response is terse: "No comment."
   Dr. Osborn argues that the Northwest has reached the end
of the "timber frontier" -- the complacent certainty that
just over the next ridgeline would always be more virgin
forest to fell. "What's over the next ridgeline now is the
Pacific Ocean," he says. Of Plum Creek, he says: "There is no
more egregious example of rapid liquidation."
   "Liquidation" is a red-flag word to Mr. Leland, sitting in
Plum Creek corporate headquarters high above the Seattle
harbor. "As a matter of fact, we started accelerating our cut
in '82, '83 to get on to a sustained-yield cut," he argues.
"Our view, and the view of most people who have studied this,
is that to move from a natural stand to a managed stand we
have to get rid of the older, slower-growing trees."
   But Mr. Leland's own figures indicate something far
removed from sustained yield. Last year, he says, Plum Creek
cut 597 million board feet; this year it targets about 500
million; in a few years it expects to throttle down to 450
million. Even the lowest figure, however, is well above his
estimate of the annual growth rate of Plum Creek's forests:
About 250 to 300 million board feet. Moreover, a Plum Creek
prospectus last year put the figure even lower:
"Approximately 210 million."
   Much of Plum Creek's future course could be affected by
what is currently being discussed in the other Washington,
the nation's capital. Congress, concerned that the U.S. is
exporting jobs along with timber, is close to banning the
export of logs cut on state-owned lands; a similar ban
already applies to federal lands. But since neither ban would
affect private lands such as Plum Creek's, logging pressures
would if anything intensify there.
   In addition, Congress remains stalemated over Idaho and
Montana wilderness bills. In still another flashpoint issue,
the federal government must address the plight of the
northern spotted owl by June 23; declaring the tiny owl
"endangered" could well put great tracts of old-growth forest
off-limits.
   Meanwhile, there are signs that Plum Creek has become
somewhat more environmentally sensitive recently. For
instance, Marcy Golde, a leader of the Washington
Environmental Council, says the company has been "very
forthcoming" in negotiating standards for cutting in the
Cascades -- though she estimates that the company's
flexibility has come after it is already about two-thirds
done there. The company says its harvest is slightly less
than half finished.
   The company also now leaves buffers along streams, spares
individual trees where eagles and spotted owls nest, and
preserves tree corridors for wildlife migration. From the
air, they look like green sidewalks across cut-over areas.
Plum Creek says it is willing to swap ecologically sensitive
land for publicly owned lands elsewhere, but complains that
such swaps can take a decade. It has offered to sell land to
homeowners but, says Mr. Bressler, gets "very few takers."
   "Most people," he says, "would rather we own the trees so
they can look at them, rather than they own the trees so they
can look at them."
   But those moves have done little to assuage people like
the group of Spokane sportsmen who gathered one recent night
to hear from some Plum Creek middle managers. Dean Lydig, a
hunter and retired lawman, whipped out photos of Plum Creek
clear-cuts. "The land speaks for itself," he said, his voice
tight with emotion. "It speaks for itself."
   James K. Lehner, the easy-going manager of Plum Creek's
Coeur d'Arlene, Idaho, division, assured Mr. Lydig that the
company is trying to do better. Then he told the group:
"We've got a public-relations problem, and we've got a
problem where people just don't quite believe us."

   Big AIDS Conference Will Be Showcase
   For Activists' Discontent With U.S. Policy

   SAN FRANCISCO -- When the Sixth International Conference
on AIDS begins here Wednesday, opening ceremonies will
feature an array of scholars and officials, as well as a gay
activist who chained himself to the New York Stock Exchange
last fall to protest the high price of the AIDS drug AZT.
   Despite the wooing and the inclusion of angry young men
such as Peter Staley of the New York-based activist group ACT
UP, the conference promises to be a theater of political
discontent over the U.S. response to the decade-old epidemic.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Inside the bunker-like Moscone Center, a subterranean
conference center in the gritty area south of Market Street,
more than 10,000 registered participants will gather to hear
some 2,500 reports on the spread, treatment and prevention of
the global epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   In the streets outside, several thousand activists are
expected to stage daily demonstrations, many directed by ACT
UP, which is prepared for as many as 500 arrests. They plan
to protest immigration laws restricting entry of homosexuals
and people with the AIDS virus as well as the country's
health establishment for the pace of research and limited
access to new drugs.
   "Access is the watchword," says Kevin Farrell, a member of
ACT UP Los Angeles, a branch of the organization. While the
group espouses peaceful civil disobedience, San Francisco
activist Josh Gamson says: "It's hard to call. There are a
lot of angry people out there."
   Despite special training in peaceful demonstrations on the
activists' part and a commitment by the San Francisco Police
Department to sensitive crowd control, there were nasty
exchanges last week over fears of violence on both sides.
   One police officer, in a televised interview, said
activists might be carrying syringes filled with tainted
blood. A police spokesman tried to defuse the incident by
branding the interview as unauthorized and the syringe story
as "rumors . . . not substantiated reports." Activists said
the affair was a ploy to unleash brutal crowd-control tactics
-- an image the city is struggling to shed. Amid such
tensions, conference organizers have offered top scientists
and dignitaries special secure accommodations and bodyguards
for the week.
   Nor will the scene inside Moscone Center be a haven of
scientific decorum. Activists vow to disrupt many speeches
and denounce powerful researchers as "criminals" in white
coats. "The intent isn't to stop the presentation, but we'll
correct them from the floor," says Robin Haueter, a member of
ACT UP from New York. "It could get interesting."
   Many scientists, such as Jerome Groopman of New England
Deaconess Hospital in Boston, say that if it turns into "a
zoo," it will doom all future efforts at a large
interdisciplinary AIDS meeting.
   The prospect of a debacle also infuriates the moderates
within the AIDS community. Pierre Ludington, an activist
here, wants to attend the meeting to learn more about the
virus that he himself is trying to fend off. To him, the
disruptions are "an absurd infringement."
   "I am going to listen and learn," Mr. Ludington says. "And
I bet the majority of virus-positive people want this meeting
to go on." He argues that the less visible majority of gay
people shouldn't allow a small cadre of activists to write
their agenda for them. Moreover, he frets about a possible
backlash.
   "People in Des Moines will watch this on TV and say,
`There go those queers again.'" Mr. Ludington says.
   If the meeting's scientific agenda doesn't collapse into
chaos, attendees can expect to hear, not about breakthroughs,
but substantial reports on vaccine progress, new disease
manifestations such as AIDS lymphoma and new drugs such as
the designer antibody from Genentech Inc. called CD4-IGG.
   Meanwhile, activists expressed only a little optimism
about any sign of reconciliation from Washington. "We're
hoping that President Bush will back down on the immigration
policy on the opening day of the conference," says ACT UP's
Mr. Farrell. Although it wouldn't derail this year's
demonstrations, he says it could salvage the 1992 AIDS
conference in Boston. That meeting just lost its major
sponsor last week, when Harvard University's AIDS Institute
withdrew its support in a protest against the border
restrictions.
   As for Mr. Bush, who declined an invitation to address the
conference, he's scheduled to spend Wednesday in more serene
surroundings, at a fund-raising event for the man whom gay
activists consider most inimical to their cause, Sen. Jesse
Helms (R., N.C.).

   Ice Cream Chain Adjusts Mix and a Franchisee Screams

   Six years ago, Roger and Joyce Stewart were seeking a
sideline business that their son could help run.
   On a visit to Dallas, the Tucson, Ariz., couple saw a busy
Steve's Ice Cream outlet, marked by a product made fresh
before customers' eyes. Sensing a winner, the family paid
$95,000 in franchise fees toward eight projected Arizona
franchises, spent $170,000 more to equip and open the first
one, and waited for the earnings to roll in.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But instead of lapping up profits from ice cream, the
Stewarts now are licking their wounds. No longer in the
business, they say they are more than $1 million poorer. And
they're embroiled in a costly legal dispute with both
Integrated Resources Inc., the chain's former franchiser, and
Steve's Homemade Ice Cream Inc., the current franchiser.
   Site selection errors, heavy debt and other factors may
have contributed to the Stewarts' failure, Mr. Stewart
concedes in an interview. But he also points a finger at the
chain's decision to sell factory-made ice cream.
   The case illustrates a common problem: Even a franchisee's
best-laid plans can go awry if a franchise promoter
unexpectedly reverses the very policies that attracted
investors. The case raises the question of what recourse the
franchisee has when the franchiser changes gears.
   "There's a gut-wrenching problem with franchisers that
have been around for a while," says Patrick J. Boroian,
president of Francorp Inc., an Olympia Fields, Ill.,
franchise-development and consulting firm. "They have to keep
remaking themselves, but often they must repudiate the things
that made them successful in the first place." Though
well-motivated, the reversals can conflict with the interests
or desires of entrenched franchisees, Mr. Boroian adds.
   In federal court in New York, the Stewarts face a lawsuit,
filed by Steve's Homemade, charging breach of contract and
trademark infringement. In their own lawsuit filed in the
same court, the Stewarts accuse Steve's Homemade -- and
Integrated as well -- of breach of contract and fraud. They
complain that Steve's Homemade, despite its name, began
requiring factorymade ice cream to be sold at new outlets.
The Stewarts contend that the switch was illegal, while the
franchisers argue the opposite.
   In January, U.S. Judge John E. Sprizzo dismissed the fraud
charges against Steve's Homemade; the breach of contract
charges await trial. Meanwhile, the Stewarts have asked the
Second Circuit Court of Appeals to restore a portion of the
dismissed charges. In so doing, they have asked the court to
decide, in part, whether it is legal in New York state --
where both Integrated and Steve's Homemade are based -- for a
"successor franchiser" to break the original franchiser's
promises. All parties deny wrongdoing.
   "Our view is that this is a frivolous case," says Stephen
D. Weinroth, chairman of Integrated. The case against
Integrated has been stayed because the financial-services
company, for reasons unrelated to its former ice cream
business, last February filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Gary P. Stevens, vice chairman of Steve's Homemade,
declined to comment on the case. But in court papers, lawyers
for Steve's Homemade say the company honored franchise
agreements and committed no fraud. From a legal standpoint,
they add, the Stewarts' appeal is an unjustified attempt "to
convert a questionable contract action into a tort action."
   In a market glutted with look-alike stores that sold
factory-made ice cream, the original Steve's store, opened in
1973, became a sensation. Under founder Stephen Herrell,
Steve's made its own ice cream at its single location, in
Somerville, Mass. "People are interested in the local-hero
kind of thing where they know the ice-cream maker," says Mr.
Herrell, now president of Herrell's Ice Cream Corp., a
Northampton, Mass., operator and franchiser of ice-cream
stores. In addition, Steve's had appeal because of its
pioneering candy, fruit and nut "mix-ins."
   By 1984, after changing ownership twice, Steve's had begun
growing into a multi-regional chain. It then had about 15
franchises overseen by Integrated. Like other franchisees,
the Stewarts paid fees and royalties in return for using an
established business name and receiving help from the
franchiser.
   "It went very well initially," says Mr. Stewart. The
family's first outlet, near the University of Arizona in
Tucson, opened in November 1984 to brisk business, he
recalls. Steve's officials from Integrated paid visits, he
says, and pitched in with advertising materials and
promotional ideas.
   Though it urged the Stewarts to proceed with more stores,
Integrated reduced its support of the Tucson store and, it
turns out, quietly negotiated to quit the business, Mr.
Stewart says. In December 1985, only about five days after
the Stewarts opened a second store, Integrated sold the
assets of its Steve's Ice Cream operations to Steve's
Homemade. The new Lindenhurst, N.Y., company was headed by
investor Richard E. Smith, who already had interests in some
factory-made ice cream brands, such as Dolly Madison.
Integrated initially retained a 20% interest in Steve's
Homemade, but eventually sold it.
   Steve's Homemade has expanded the chain to about 100
Steve's franchises in the U.S. and 20 in Japan. It insisted
that new outlets use factory-made ice cream, the Stewarts
complain. This gave the franchiser a new source of income --
from supplying the product. The move also improved the
quality of Steve's ice cream and ensured "a uniform product
throughout the chain," says David M. Smith, Richard's son,
marketing vice president of Steve's Homemade. Many
franchisees, he adds, were happy to be freed from the demands
of making their own ice cream.
   But the change in franchisers came at the worst possible
time for the Stewarts. Their second store -- in Tempe, a
Phoenix suburb -- opened before the Stewarts had a franchise
agreement covering it. When the new franchiser sent the
contract, it called for factory-made ice cream. But the
Stewarts and a new partner say they had already invested
about $100,000 in the store, largely for equipment to make
ice cream.
   In a court deposition, Mr. Stewart says Steve's Homemade
advised him to keep the machines -- but only to maintain the
fiction that the store was making fresh ice cream. (The
company's Mr. Stevens declined to comment on this
allegation.)
   The family was also upset because Richard Smith planned to
sell factory-made Steve's Ice Cream in supermarkets. Steve's
outlets no longer enjoyed an exclusive on the brand name --
and, according to the Stewarts, now faced price competition
from low-margin supermarkets.
   On top of all that, the Stewarts say they were having
second thoughts about their obligation to develop eight
stores. Though brisk initially, sales at their first store
had slowed and weren't meeting projections. And sales at the
new Tempe store -- in a location that Mr. Stewart now says
was poor -- were even worse. The stores never became
profitable, the family says.
   Faced with all the problems, the Stewarts balked at
signing the new franchise agreement and began withholding
fees and royalties. Steve's Homemade then filed its lawsuit.
The Stewarts agreed to stop using the Steve's name, pending
the outcome of the litigation. They sold the Tempe store at a
loss in 1988. Last year, the Tucson store closed after the
city, in order to allow for a wider street, condemned the
building in which it was situated.
   Now the Stewarts hope to recover their losses in court,
while possibly setting a precedent that helps other
franchisees. Meanwhile, an amused Stephen Herrell notes how
much has changed at the chain that bears his first name. He
says, "If people want to see what the original Steve's was
like, they have to go to Herrell's."

   Nielsen Ratings Will Face Competition
   As Britain's AGB Plans to Re-Enter U.S.

   NEW YORK -- The A.C. Nielsen Co., whose audience ratings
methodology is harshly criticized by the three major
broadcast networks, is about to get new competition: AGB
Television Research, a British-based ratings company owned by
Robert Maxwell, the British media conglomerate owner.
   The AGB plan is only one of several expected from research
companies as the networks seek alternatives to the Nielsen
measurement system. For example, the Arbitron Co. is testing
a sophisticated system in Denver, titled ScanAmerica, that
connects product purchasing with the viewing of television
commercials.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   AGB challenged Nielsen, a division of Dun &amp; Bradstreet
Corp., in the 1980s, but lost $67 million after only CBS Inc.
paid for the service. Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and National
Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., declined to
participate in AGB's attempt to take on Nielsen's monopoly in
measuring the American television audience. AGB shut down its
American subsidiary in August 1988.
   AGB's move, which is expected to be announced today, is
the latest salvo in the increasingly bitter dispute between
the three networks and Nielsen, which earns a combined $15
million annually from the networks for suppling ratings data
on which advertising rates and the fates of prime-time series
are decided.
   Each network alleges that Nielsen's ratings based on the
so-called people meter, an electronic device with
push-buttons, are inaccurate. For ratings to register, an
individual must press a button on the people meter each time
a program is viewed. The networks say the audience easily
tires of such an exercise.
   The networks have openly encouraged other companies,
domestic or foreign, to take on Nielsen, and they said they
will pay for the service.
   "We welcome the competition," said David F. Poltrack, a
CBS senior vice president.
   Mr. Poltrack said he didn't expect AGB, a subsidiary of
Audits of Great Britain, will be able to have a service
operational until September 1992. "We anticipate the 1991-92
television season as a year of experimentation for AGB," he
said.
   A Nielsen spokesman said: "We welcome the challenge. We've
competed before, we'll compete again. We'll compete with
anybody. Competition is nothing new to us."
   AGB pioneered the people meter system in Britain. It was
AGB's arrival in the American market that forced Nielsen to
quickly switch to people meters from handwritten diaries. AGB
supplied ratings during the 1987-88 television season.
   Although he declined specific comment, another network
executive said Mr. Poltrack was briefed by AGB officials
Friday about how AGB's system would differ from Nielsen's.
"Clearly the industry does not need a copy cat approach to
Nielsen," he said.
   For example, AGB will remove an individual or family from
its survey if it discovers that the household has stopped
using the people meter. Nielsen doesn't turn over its sample
of 4,000 people meter households for two years.
   Nielsen recently challenged AGB for the British market.
But AGB prevailed in intense bidding. "We came a lot closer
than anyone expected," said a Nielsen official. Nielsen is
used in other overseas markets, including Australia.
   The controversy with Nielsen deepened recently when
Nielsen data showed television network viewing plunging by 7%
in the first quarter. Neither the networks nor Nielsen could
explain the sharp drop, which resulted in the networks giving
back millions of dollars in free ad time to advertisers.
Sponsors receive free commercial time, or "make goods," when
audience viewing levels fall below those guaranteed by the
networks.
   All three networks said last week that they will no longer
give advertisers traditional audience guarantees. Instead,
the networks said, they will adopt a plan presented by NBC
last week. That plan uses an eight-year audience average to
project ratings, instead of relying exclusively on Nielsen
ratings.
   The moves come as the television and advertising
industries prepare for the projected $4.4 billion up-front
market, when advertising is sold in advance of the 1990-91
season, which begins in September.

   Getting to Zanzibar
   Isn't Half the Fun,
   It Isn't Any Fun

   Tourists Who Make It
   Might Wish They Hadn't

   ZANZIBAR, Tanzania -- Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and the
Hollywood movie to the contrary, there is no Road to
Zanzibar.
   For one thing, it's an island in the Indian Ocean
inaccessible by land. You can't even be sure of getting there
by boat or plane. And once you are there, you might wonder
why you bothered.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   All of which is trouble for the local tourist trade.
   Zanzibar is a quirky place. Once part of a British
protectorate, it overthrew Arab rulers in 1964, only to then
merge with Tanzania. Its president at the time, hoping to
attract visitors, set about building the world's largest
swimming pool -- in a swamp. Pouring concrete there didn't
work out well, but hope springs eternal.
   Today, Chief Minister Omar Juma, who, like many
Zanzibaris, is given to sighing wistfully, considers it his
mission to create a tourist trade that will save Zanzibar's
decaying economy.
   In theory that isn't a bad idea, since the island has the
makings of a tropical paradise: groves of coconut palms
hugging pristine coral beaches, an equatorial climate with a
dry period from June to October and cool southeast trade
winds. Native spices -- cloves, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg
-- add an alluring aroma. The ancient Stone Town, the
commercial quarter of limestone buildings set on twisting
narrow streets, oozes history of Arab slave traders, Persian
craftsmen and African chieftans.
   Unfortunately the streets at times also ooze sewage. The
buildings, in various stages of collapse, are mainly occupied
by squatters. Half the island's children are malnourished.
And skinny cats chase skinny rats. The local mosquitoes carry
malaria. The water isn't potable, and the best hotel is none
too good.
   It isn't surprising then that the tourist trade suffers
from a decided lack of tourists. The government claims there
were 43,557 of them last year, but the figure is way off,
including as it surely must residents returning from the
mainland and everybody else who came to the island for any
reason at all. The 700,000 people who live on Zanzibar mostly
are peasants engaged in farming, fishing and trade.
   Since transport is a problem, there are precious few
visitors to Zanzibar today. Those who actually make it here
are mainly Europeans, Arabs and Indians -- and students with
packs on their backs.
   "I must confess," sighs Mr. Juma, "it is very difficult
for tourists to get to Zanzibar. You can get stranded in Dar
es Salaam."
   That isn't a pleasant prospect either. Dar es Salaam is
the seedy capital of Tanzania, a huge, seedy nation. Dar es
Salaam has the biggest urban potholes in Africa. It also has
a fairly modern airport, which is a plus, since one is likely
to get stuck there for hours and hours.
   Dar es Salaam lies a mere 20 miles west of Zanzibar, a
distance shorter than a marathon but harder to negotiate.
   The latest brochure on Zanzibar from the tourist office in
Dar was printed in 1983 and speaks of "up to four flights
daily" and "several passenger ferries." That information is
hopelessly out of date. Zanzibaris tell the tale, sighing
wistfully, of the Virgin Butterfly, a Norwegian catamaran
that carried travelers between Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar.
For several months last year, the Butterfly actually plied
the seas in air-conditioned style, making the trip in less
than an hour. Then one day, the Butterfly broke down. Fixing
it was adjudged to be "too sophisticated" for Zanzibari
technology, so the craft was towed to the Kenyan port of
Mombasa. Work was just commencing when, as a local
businessman explains it, "one fine night, the Butterfly, she
just disappears." Apparently, she disappeared back to
Scandinavia.
   In the wake of the Butterfly came the Dolphin, a
fresh-water ferry from the U.S. made seaworthy for saltwater.
Two months ago it began chugging from mainland to island in
about three hours. It was no Butterfly, but for several weeks
it did the trick, until it hit a reef about six miles off
Zanzibar. It awaits repair.
   For the truly desperate traveler, there are the Arab
trading dhows, which carry all manner of cargo in their
wooden hulls, including the occasional tourist. If the wind
is right, the dhows can make the trip to Zanzibar in four to
five hours. If the wind isn't right, the traders lower sail
and can drift for four or five days. To lighten the load, the
traders will first throw the tourists' luggage overboard, and
then, if need be, the tourists themselves. "It happens," says
a travel agent for the Tanzania Tourist Corp. in Dar es
Salaam. "Better to forget the dhows. Why not just fly?"
   Ah, yes, the national airline, ATC. It's not for nothing
that the locals call Air Tanzania Corp. "Any Time Canceled"
and "Air Total Confusion." Whatever the brochures say, it is
cause for jubilation on the island when a flight arrives.
Scheduled flights to Zanzibar are routinely rerouted to
destinations on the mainland, and even foreigners who have
paid for their tickets in dollars are frequently bumped and
recompensed in Tanzanian shillings. Last month, passengers
flying to Zanzibar from Oman were told to disembark in Dar
because the plane was being rerouted. The passengers refused.
After a standoff lasting several hours, the plane actually
made the 15 minute flight to Zanzibar.
   The last resort is to charter an 18-year-old Cessna. On
take-off, the pilot apologizes for the plane's tattered
condition. "At least it flies," he says. It has till now. The
fare: $200, one way.
   Of course, even the charter doesn't fly when the Zanzibar
airport is closed, as it was for five days last month. That
was one week that this tourist paradise went without
tourists, except for those already marooned here.
   Some Zanzibaris are willing to blame everything on bad
luck. Boats break down, flights are canceled. Things happen.
Still, with African political intrigue as thick as the
malarial mosquitoes, conspiracy theories abound.
   "Zanzibar wants tourists, but it doesn't want foreigners,"
whispers Zanzibari political dissident Muhammed Ali. "The
authorities fear that if foreigners come, the Zanzibaris will
inform them about the situation."
   Mr. Ali spent seven months in a Zanzibar jail in 1983 for
opposing union between Zanzibar and Tanzania and now, as he
speaks in the foyer of the Dar es Salaam library, he is
suddenly surrounded by young men straining to listen like
extras in one of those old E.F. Hutton commercials.
"Informants," says Mr. Ali. To throw them off, he picks up a
copy of the Economist and pretends to read. Then he walks to
the bookshelves and pretends to browse.
   The "situation," he explains quietly, is that a number of
dissidents such as himself are agitating for Zanzibar's
independence. Zanzibar, he says, has been neglected since it
joined the union in 1964. The mainland government, he says,
has consistently refused Zanzibar permission to start its own
air service to provide for a reliable tourist trade. That is
proof, he insists, of a conspiracy to isolate the island.
   "Why else," he asks, "should it be so difficult to get to
Zanzibar?"
   A lonely bartender at the Bwawani Hotel, confronted with
the riddle, throws up his arms. The Bwawani, a concrete
monstrosity painted a garish yellow, is located on the edge
of the swamp where the world's largest pool is in an advanced
state of rot. On a good day, 20 of its 120 rooms are
occupied. It is supposed to be the best hotel on the island,
providing "luxury accommodations for visitors." Visited
recently, the place was in the middle of a power failure and
phones weren't working. So much for luxury. "No boats, no
planes," sighs the bartender wistfully. "Maybe in 10 years it
will be better."
   Zanzibar has already been waiting 30 years for better, its
development on hold since the 1964 revolution. Its heyday was
in the mid-1800s, under the rule of the Sultan of Oman, when
the island was the center of the ignominious Arab slave
trade. It enjoyed a brief renaissance earlier this century as
the fabled Spice Island, exporting its cloves to the world.
But as its largest customers learned to grow cloves
themselves, the market collapsed. As they say here, as cloves
go, so goes Zanzibar.
   Perhaps, says Chief Minister Juma, Tanzania's current tilt
toward private enterprise, after three decades of socialism
and pervasive nationalization, will save Zanzibar. He speaks
hopefully of a privately run airport, a private air service
that can maintain regular flights, and of returning Stone
Town to private owners who will fix up the houses.
   There is just one problem. "I must confess," Mr. Juma
sighs, "most of our people are not very experienced in
private matters."

   Caesars World to Manage Nevada Hotel
   As Part of Japanese Development Plan

   LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Caesars World Inc. said it signed an
agreement with Cosmo World, a Japanese development concern,
to manage a non-casino luxury hotel as part of a $600 million
master planned community near Henderson, Nev.
   The 1,228-acre Cosmo World project, situated roughly 15
miles from Las Vegas, will include 2,500 homes, a
championship golf course designed by Jack Nicklaus, a tennis
complex and other facilities. The project, called Silver
Canyon, is scheduled to open in 1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 350-room hotel, Caesars Canyon Resort, would be
Caesars' first non-casino luxury resort. Caesars also
operates honeymoon properties in the Poconos, which are aimed
at a middle-class market.
   Caesars World didn't break out the details of its
management contract with the developers, but Henry Gluck,
Caesars chairman and chief executive officer, said the
company may consider other joint projects with Cosmo World in
the future. He also said the company's newly created Caesars
World Resorts subsidiary will seek similar projects, mostly
through management agreements.
   Cosmo World executives couldn't be reached to comment.
Cosmo World builds and operates golf courses in Japan, where
it currently has six courses under construction. The company
recently opened a golf course in Salzburg, Austria, and is
planning other projects in the United States and Europe. The
company also makes golf clubs and professional photography
equipment.
   Silver Canyon, as well as other planned projects, is part
of a new wave of development here that regional officials say
will help position the area as a destination resort rather
than just a gambling mecca. The Cosmo resort also is designed
to attract international visitors who travel with families or
who dislike staying in a casino-hotel.
   Mr. Gluck said the hotel venture is part of the company's
efforts to cash in on the Caesars name, which is particularly
well known in the international market. "We have a tremendous
consumer franchise," Mr. Gluck said.
   Some Wall Street analysts, however, have voiced skepticism
about Caesars' other marketing ventures, such as its
fragrance line. Also, they note, major new competitors in
Caesars' key casino markets are targeting the company's
high-rolling clientele. Mr. Gluck said the resort will be a
good marketing tool for its casinos, and doesn't demand the
hundreds of millions in capital that Caesars would need to
launch a similar project by itself.
   Despite the added competition to its casinos, Mr. Gluck
said Caesars' basic business remains strong. The retail
shopping project at its flagship Caesars Palace, which is
scheduled to open in late 1991, is already 65% leased, he
said.

   Businessland's Top
   Marketing, Sales
   Executives Leave

   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Businessland Inc. dismissed its top
two marketing and sales executives, reflecting management's
concern that the computer retailer's performance in those
areas wasn't cutting it.
   The company said the two executives, James A. Heisch and
Murray Dennis, resigned. However, a company spokeswoman,
Beverley Bird, acknowledged that the two "basically" were
fired. Rumors that heads would roll in the marketing and
sales departments had been circulating for months, company
officials said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Heisch had been senior vice president, sales and
services. Mr. Dennis was vice president, marketing. Neither
could be reached for comment.
   Businessland has been plagued recently by shrinking
margins and a series of other problems that have dragged down
profits and left the company seemingly somewhat adrift. In
January, the company said it intended to trim as much as 10%
to 15% of its work force and to close poorly performing
stores. It had a loss of $1.7 million, or six cents a share,
on sales of $323.4 million in the third fiscal quarter ended
March 31.
   Furthermore, the company still hasn't recovered from a
bitter feud with Compaq Corp. Last year, Compaq's chief
executive, Rod Canion, cut off sales of its machines to
Businessland after Businessland's chief executive, David
Norman, criticized a new Compaq product. The two companies
re-established ties in March, but Businessland hasn't been
able to recapture many of the customers it lost as a result
of not being able to provide Compaq machines.
   Ms. Bird said the two executives weren't dismissed for any
particular gaffe. But she noted that both men started with
the company in fields other than marketing; Mr. Heisch had
been chief financial officer, and Mr. Dennis had been general
manager. "They both went into different areas where they
didn't have that much experience," she said. "We just feel
that we need more seasoned people in those roles, people with
large-company experience." She said a search is under way to
replace the two men.
   Analysts said one problem Businessland has faced on the
marketing side has been its inability to successfully
implement a decision to de-emphasize simple-computer
retailing and to broaden the company's so-called
"value-added" services, such as offering to tailor an entire
computer system to a particular business's needs.
   "They haven't been getting it," said Susan Yamada, an
analyst with Merrin Information Services Inc., Palo Alto,
Calif. "They're going to companies and saying, `We'll do this
and this and that for you,' but the companies are saying,
`Forget it.'" Businessland needs marketing and sales
executives "who know how to compete for that type of sale,"
she said.
   Ms. Yamada also saw the executives' departure as a
possible indicator that the company's fourth-quarter results
weren't good. She predicted that the company will have a loss
for both the fourth quarter and the full year. For the nine
months, Businessland had net income of $1.4 million, or four
cents a share, on sales of $1 billion.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday, Businessland closed at $8.75, up 12.5 cents.

   Law -- Washington Docket:
   Some Legal Experts See Flaws in Plans
   To Amend Constitution to Protect Flag

CONGRESS (CNG)
SUPREME COURT (SUP)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- In the week since the Supreme Court struck
down the federal flag law, the debate has focused on whether
to amend the Constitution to protect the flag. But little
attention has been paid to how the proposed amendment would
work.
   At first glance, the amendment appears straightforward.
"The Congress and the states shall have power to prohibit the
physical desecration of the flag of the United States," reads
the text proposed in both the House and Senate and favored by
President Bush.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But some constitutional law experts say that the wording
of the proposal, far from being straightforward, is ambiguous
and will lead to considerable uncertainty. "The proposal
creates a constitutional black hole," says Walter Dellinger,
a Duke University Law School professor and an opponent of any
flag amendment.
   The Supreme Court found that both the Texas flag law it
struck down last year and the federal law it invalidated last
week violated the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of
speech. Logically, then, a constitutional amendment to
protect the flag would have to modify the First Amendment.
   But the proposed amendment doesn't say what it would
modify, notes William Van Alstyne, also a Duke University Law
School professor. There is nothing in the proposal "that
suggests the First Amendment is to be deemed no longer
applicable to any state or national law providing penalties
for what the government may regard as the physical
desecration . . . of the flag," he says.
   Because the proposed amendment doesn't make clear its
effect on the First Amendment, Mr. Van Alstyne says, it is
possible that even if it is adopted the Supreme Court might
still find the Texas flag law unconstitutional under the
First Amendment when it is used to prosecute those who burn
the flag as a political protest.
   Mr. Van Alstyne argues that it is no accident that the
proposal doesn't mention the First Amendment directly. An
amendment that squarely removed "one particular kind of
symbolic expression" from the protection of the First
Amendment, he says, "would be unseemly" and "would embarrass
us."
   Mr. Dellinger says the proposal must be intended to alter
the First Amendment, because Congress and the states already
have the power to protect the flag in situations to which the
First Amendment doesn't apply. For example, the Supreme Court
suggested last week that Congress and the states still may be
free to protect publicly owned flags, and that Congress also
may be able to prohibit commercial exploitation of the flag.
   But Mr. Dellinger raises other concerns. The Supreme Court
has long held that laws restricting speech or other forms of
expression protected by the First Amendment are
unconstitutional if they are too vague or too broad. If 50
states and even more local governments pass new flag laws,
will they be subject to vagueness and overbreadth rulings, or
will they be exempt?
   And, he asks, what of the Eighth Amendment limits on
criminal sentences that are "cruel and unusual punishment?"
Are they applicable to new flag laws, or will they be swept
aside by the proposed amendment?
   Mr. Dellinger also notes that state and local governments
may define "physical desecration" in disparate ways. A city
or state could choose to include the waving of the flag at
political rallies or conventions as a form of physical
desecration, he says.
   Besides these uncertainties, there is another wild card in
the flag debate. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph
Biden, a Delaware Democrat, is drafting his own amendment,
which is intended to be less ambiguous than the one backed by
the administration.
   Moreover, congressional aides who are familiar with the
effort say Sen. Biden plans an approach like Prohibition,
which was established by the 18th Amendment. Aides say the
Biden amendment would prohibit desecration of the flag but
would say that Congress alone may pass laws to enforce it.
   Sen. Biden has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on the
flag, but he isn't expected to reveal his proposal then. One
problem he faces, according to congressional aides, is that
he can't find constitutional law experts to testify in favor
of his plan.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Theater:
   Brecht's Berlin; Sterner's U.S.
   ----

<LP>
   Chicago -- We're being administered heavy doses of epochal
theater here, one from the lurid, pre-Hitler Germany of the
1920s, the other from the rapacious, pre-Bush U.S. of the
1980s. "Threepenny Opera," by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill,
was imported by Chicago's third International Theatre
Festival in a production of the Theater An Der Ruhr, a young
troupe that operates out of Muelheim, West Germany. A local
production company is doing a new play, "Other People's
Money," originally produced in New York in 1987 and still
running there as a kind of cult event. The playwright is
Jerry Sterner, a former real estate syndicator and
stock-market speculator, whose venture into theater plays
resonantly along with the Brecht. One of the most famous
lines in "Threepenny Opera" is: "Grub first, then ethics."
MacHeath, Mackie the Knife, sings the line to a laconic but
delightful Kurt Weill tune. Mr. Sterner is no Brecht, and he
has no Weill to lift his leaden prose. But his main
character, the takeover artist Lawrence Garfinkle, Larry the
Liquidator, can sound Brechtian: "We've come from `Ask not
what your country can do for you' to `What's in it for me?'
to `What's in it for me -- today]' all in one short
generation."
   Nobody even started out innocent in Brecht's Berlin.
Mackie is an old-fashioned crook who would steal anything not
tied down, even if he had to kill for it. He could count on
his friend, Tiger Brown, the police chief, to look the other
way. The only thing Mackie favored above crime was sex, and
sometimes he was able to combine them in rape. His women
loved Mackie as much as he loved them, which is to say they
had no problem betraying him to Peachum, the father of
Mackie's bride, who wanted Mackie hanged.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Greed also was pretty widely distributed, according to Mr.
Sterner, in the epoch of corporate cannibalism just ending.
Labor sucked companies dry. Politicians stole money and
raised taxes, making it even harder for our companies to
compete. Management ignored the handwriting on the wall in
order to protect their cushy jobs. Lawyers and investment
bankers hired themselves out to the highest bidders and
conjured up schemes such as stock repurchases, shark
repellents, poison pills, greenmail and golden parachutes, to
protect unworthy managements while diluting stockholder, or
"stuckholder" interests, as Garfinkle puts it.
   So we live in a time that should make it possible for an
accomplished German theater troupe to visit these shores and
re-create the mood of Brecht and Weill's Berlin. To be sure,
"Threepenny Opera" is not easy to bring off, but the
International Theatre Festival had an obligation to import a
company capable of doing so. Chicago, after all, is not
Edinburgh, or Spoleto, or Charleston, S.C., cities and towns
that import theater periodically because they have relatively
little of their own. The millions of dollars in grants from
Ameritech, Illinois Bell and other corporate sponsors
expended to shlep Theatre An Der Ruhr and the other
international companies across the water might instead be
nourishing another "Grapes of Wrath" at Chicago's Steppenwolf
Theatre Company, which just won the Tony Award for best
Broadway play, or "Glengarry Glen Ross," the David Mamet
piece that was developed at the Goodman Theatre. Instead of a
"Threepenny Opera" dramatically better than one of our own
young theaters might have done locally, we got a mildly
interesting production by a company younger and greener than
several doing business here.
   Much of the mild interest was supplied by having the part
of Jenny, brilliantly created and often re-created by Weill's
wife, Lotte Lenya, played by a mincing man, Volker Roos. The
point, I suppose, is to suggest the utter decadence of the
epoch, but one can't help thinking that it was to obscure the
absence of a female who could come close to matching Lenya's
recorded performances, notably the splendid 1931 film version
made by G.W. Pabst.
   The street singers and pianist who open the show with the
famous "Ballad of Mackie the Knife" are played as clowns.
Perhaps because they can't sing either, director and company
founder Robert Ciulli has them run through lots of clown
business as the evening wears on, but to no good effect. The
play itself is burlesque enough without superfluous gags. If
the unnecessary and unwanted clown shtik made the audience
impatient, the lack of adequate translation was downright
frustrating. We cannot blame the acting troupe for the
failures of the simultaneous-translation technology that
prevented those not fluent in German from understanding the
opening scene. But it must have been by design that Mr.
Ciulli didn't even attempt to translate Brecht's lyrics to
Weill's tunes -- a great mistake.
   In "Other People's Money," Mr. Sterner's dialogue
sometimes reads as if it were a mediocre translation from
some other tongue, but director Kevin Conway, who played
Garfinkle in the New York production, derives real feelings
and mixed motives from his characters. As Jorgenson, the
elderly chairman of the unfriendly takeover target, Edgar
Meyer conveys a nice sense of challenged rectitude. Peter Van
Wagner's smart, roguish Lawrence Garfinkle plays the takeover
game with a feeling of joy that obviously transcends his
quest for money. Larry not only wants to liquidate New
England Wire and Cable, he also wants to win the body and
even the heart of Kate Sullivan, the tough yuppie lawyer who
comes back to her home town of Providence to defend the
company.
   The role of Kate is not easy to portray. She's got to be
smart, shrewd, tough and sexy. Elizabeth Hess plays Kate as
an aggressive cheerleader, which just isn't enough. I can
imagine Kathleen Turner succeeding with Kate, but even she
would have problems. The young Lotte Lenya would have been
perfect. But even without a script that sings or a perfect
cast, "Other People's Money" is very satisfying theater.
Unlike the movie "Wall Street," Mr. Sterner's play doesn't
let us rest comfortably with the false notion that the
takeover artists are unnatural predators who are destroying
our industrial ecology. Larry the Liquidator is no more a
hero than Mackie the Knife. He's in the game because he loves
money and what it buys. But he also believes that he is
making assets more productive, forcing workers to do a day's
work for a day's pay, replacing complacent managers with
those who know how to go head to head against the Japanese .
. . and the Germans.
   If these theatrical productions are a gauge of how well
various countries can compete in the international
marketplace, buy American. Theater An Der Ruhr presented
"Threepenny Opera" as part of the International Theatre
Festival and immediately returned to Germany to begin
rehearsals for its new season. Other People's Money" will run
at least through the summer at the Royal George Theater.

   Investing, and Retiring, Well

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A9

   All of us, from time to time, think nostalgically about
reliving at least part of our childhood. But then we remember
our introduction to algebra and "word problems." If you
haven't quit reading yet, stick with me -- it might be
important to your financial well-being.
   For example, here are a couple of word problems anyone
contemplating retirement ought to learn how to solve. You
estimate that you must accumulate $600,000 of investable
funds by age 65, just seven years from now. How much must you
deposit at the end of each year in an account that pays 8%
tax-free to reach that goal?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   You also have decided that you do not wish to leave an
estate and you believe you will live 13 years after you
retire. (That is one actuarial estimate for a 65-year-old
male.) If you want a monthly income of $7,000 over your
retired lifetime, at what annual rate of return must your
nest egg be invested?
   Such are the tense relationships between money and
investing that Michael Thomsett considers ever so gently in
his new book, "The Mathematics of Investing" (John Wiley, 244
pages, $29.95). Mr. Thomsett starts by reviewing the basic
ideas of the time value of money, illustrating them with
simple examples. He then moves on to more complicated
problems so that within an hour you could easily manage the
answers to the two questions posed above (and if you can't,
keep reading).
   Two forces are certain to play an important role for
anyone considering retirement-taxes and inflation. Mr.
Thomsett has a brief chapter on how to include the effects of
those facts of life on any investment. The material presented
is not detailed, but should encourage you to include them in
your planning. Another chapter gives the math that should be
known by anyone who buys bonds. With the junk-bond market in
the tank many savvy investors now are trying to pick up a few
bonds that bark like Dalmatians.
   On the surface, investing in the bond market looks simple.
And it is, if you only compute the current yield -- the
stated interest rate for the bond divided by its cost.
(That's the calculation this newspaper makes in its New York
and American bond listings.) But Mr. Thomsett shows how to
figure out approximately a bond's yield-to-maturity that
takes into account if it is purchased at a premium or a
discount to its face value. That approximation should be good
enough for most people who have not been convicted of
shenanigans in the junk-bond market. This book is elementary
and so it won't turn you into a financial wizard, but it will
help you find answers to some key questions involving money.
   ---
   But suppose you already understand how to use the simpler
mathematical relationships that govern money and investing.
Then you might be ready for the book by Stephen Brown and
Mark Kritzman, "Quantitative Methods for Financial Analysis"
(Dow Jones-Irwin, 266 pages, $42.50). This is the second
edition of this book and is required reading for candidates
for chartered financial analyst certification. However, that
doesn't mean others shouldn't consider owning it.
   Besides covering nearly all the techniques described in
Mr. Thomsett's book, "Methods" goes considerably further. For
example, it applies mathematical techniques to real estate
investments, option and futures instruments and asset
allocation. It even has a section on "closet indexing" that
can be cheerfully discussed without embarrassment in mixed
company. And for those of you who have forgotten what you
learned in Statistics 101 and/or managed to avoid
successfully finding out whether your roommate was a standard
deviation, the book has an appendix on the principles of
statistics.
   ---
   But suppose you have no interest in learning about the
mathematics of finance but just want to reduce the amount of
money you are going to have to pay back on your mortgage. For
you Marc Eisenson has written "The Banker's Secret" (Villard
Books, 256 pages, $14.95). He has managed to put his own time
to good use, generating an entire book out of a simple
application of time value of money principles. This book
makes a big deal out of how a homeowner who pays an
additional $25 a month on his mortgage would save more than
$34,000 in interest and shorten a 30-year loan by more than
five years. It includes copious mortgage tables and schedules
to guide you through the calculations required to find your
savings. A homeowner interested in reducing his total
financial outlay on his house might be better off: (1)
applying the cost of this book to the principal he owes on
his house, and (2) then learning to solve all kinds of time
value of money problems by purchasing either of the first two
books reviewed in this column.
   ---
   And now for the envelope, please. The way I figure, you
must deposit $67,243 in the account annually to accumulate
$600,000 and your nest egg must be invested at 10.3% for you
to receive a monthly income of $7,000.

   LONDON -- Where's the beef?
   It's showing up again on many British dinner plates as a
monthlong scare over "mad cow disease" has begun to ease.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, the consumer panic may now reignite -- but this
time hurt pork and poultry sales -- because of new scientific
fears that pigs and chickens could become susceptible to the
deadly disease.
   In recent testimony before a parliamentary panel, several
researchers urged the U.K. government to include pigs and
poultry in an animal-feed ban intended to check the disease's
spread among cattle and sheep. "The best way to control this
thing is to make {the ban} mandatory" for all animal feed,
Gareth Roberts, a lecturer in neuroanatomy at St. Mary's
Hospital Medical School in London, said in an interview
elaborating on his testimony. "It's common sense, really,
rather than any startling scientific finding."
   Ivor Mills, a Cambridge University emeritus professor of
medicine who also testified, added in an interview that "if
they {government officials} are going to wait until this
{infection} has taken place, then the danger to man increases
dramatically."
   But the government, still shaken by the domestic
beef-sales tumble and a fight with three European neighbors
over "mad cow disease," refuses to buy any more such
hypotheses. "Ministers can only act on good science," said
Peter Wilkinson, a spokesman for Britain's Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. "There's no scientific
justification for such a ban" on poultry and pig feed.
   British farmers aren't taking any chances, however. The
National Farmers Union is encouraging its members to stop
using any animal feed that may be infected with the disease.
In an internal memo, the farmer group said that consumer
organizations believe the voluntary ban "would help public
confidence" even though "there is no danger to pigs and
poultry" from the feed.
   Mad cow disease, officially called bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, has forced the slaughter of 14,324 cows in
Britain since 1986. The government has paid farmers about #6
million ($10.2 million) for their losses. The disease,
thought to be carried by a virus, makes cows' brains go
spongy and causes the animals to stagger and foam at the
mouth.
   There isn't any proof that humans are at risk from eating
contaminated beef. The panic among British consumers was
triggered by the mid-May death of Max, a Siamese cat with
symptoms like those of the disease. His death prompted fears
that the disease can be passed from one species to another.
   Tabloid newspapers ran sensational headlines on the
matter, and several communities banned beef from school
lunches. But U.K. officials insisted that British beef
remained safe to eat. Many consumers discounted such
reassurances, however, because they felt the government had
handled previous food scares badly. Beef consumption dropped
an estimated 10% to 15% in late May, and the European
Community began buying British beef to try to keep prices
from plunging.
   France, Italy and West Germany then banned imports of
British beef, setting off a political firestorm amid threats
of EC legal action and of British counteraction. The three
countries lifted their bans June 7, when EC ministers agreed
on measures to contain mad cow disease. But the crisis isn't
over. Last week, Switzerland imposed an immediate ban on
imports of British cattle and beef as a precaution against
the disease.
   In Britain, meanwhile, meat producers and major food
chains such as J. Sainsbury PLC and Tesco Stores Ltd. say
beef sales are starting to recover. The EC settlement helped
to push mad cow disease off newspapers' front pages.
   "People have begun to realize that it {the scare} was
exaggerated and have gone back to eating beef," says Clare
Cheney, assistant director of the British Retailers
Association. Gavin Richardson, an account director at
market-research concern AGB Research, says that "people have
short memories" about food scares.

   Among Far East nations, the outlook for corporate-earnings
growth improved in Hong Kong and Malaysia during May but
continued to deteriorate in Japan, according to the latest
survey of analysts by Institutional Brokers Estimate System.
   According to the survey, earnings prospects were
little-changed in Australia, Singapore, Thailand, New Zealand
and South Korea. Because of insufficient data, IBES doesn't
generate estimates for Taiwan, the Philippines or Indonesia.
   IBES, a unit of the New York-based securities house Lynch
Jones &amp; Ryan, tabulates thousands of analysts' reports each
month to produce "consensus" earnings estimates for
individual stocks and markets throughout the world. The
consensus estimates always look 12 months into the future and
are derived by combining per-share earnings estimates for
each company's current fiscal year with estimates for its
next fiscal year.
   In the case of Japan, overall estimated earnings growth
fell to 5% from 8% last month, the lowest level since IBES
began tracking Japanese shares in February 1989. Although
analysts expected earnings in most market sectors to increase
at least 5% in the next 12 months, they predicted that
earnings growth will decline in three sectors: utilities,
financial services and energy-related companies.
                                                                                                       

   SOUTH KOREAN INFLATION
                                                                                                       

   A South Korean government think tank predicted the
nation's consumer prices would rise 12% to 13% this year,
about twice the government's original projection of 5% to 7%.
The Korea Development Institute said the 1990 inflation rate
would be the largest rise since 1981, when consumer prices
surged 21% on a year-on-year basis. The institute noted that
unless the high inflationary pressures are curbed, workers,
who had agreed to relatively low wage increases this year,
will demand high wage raises next year.
                                                                                                       

   SWISS BAN BRITISH BEEF
                                                                                                       

   Switzerland banned imports of British cattle and beef as a
precaution against "mad cow" disease, the nerve disorder that
has killed 13,000 cows in Britain over the past four years.
Last week, France, Germany and Italy lifted bans on British
beef imports after a compromise devised by the 12-nation
European Community, of which Switzerland isn't a member.
Under the compromise, EC farm ministers agreed to limit
British exports of live cattle to calves under six months of
age, and to certify that beef exports were from herds where
no traces of the disease were found in the past two years.
                                                                                                       

   MALAYSIA AIRLINES BONUS
                                                                                                       

   The 16,000 employees of Malaysia Airlines will get a bonus
of three months' pay because of increased profit in the
fiscal year ended last March 31, said Managing Director Abdul
Aziz Abdul Rahman. He said the airlines' financial accounts
were still being audited but that net profit for the last
fiscal year was estimated at 180 million ringgit ($66.4
million); the previous year's net profit was 154 million
ringgit, and two months' bonus was paid to the staff.
                                                                                                       

   AIDS IN THE PHILIPPINES
                                                                                                       

   AIDS is spreading at double its previous rate in the
Philippines, the government said. It said there were four
cases a month in 1990, compared with two a month last year.
Manuel Dayrit, government health director for AIDS control,
said the nation had a total of 172 AIDS-related cases on
record, of which 31 had the disease and 141 were infected
with the HIV virus. Twenty people had died of AIDS thus far,
he said. Mr. Dayrit said female prostitutes were the largest
group of those infected, totaling 93 cases.
                                                                                                       

   ANGER IN TAIWAN
                                                                                                       

   Taiwan's Vice Economics Minister Chiang Pin-kung told
Taiwanese and Japanese industrialists that Japan "was sick
with fear of the rabid Chinese Communists" and treated Taiwan
with less respect than the smallest African country. Taiwan
had a record trade deficit of $6.96 billion with Japan in
1989. Mr. Chiang said Japan wouldn't address the trade issue
because it feared offending Beijing.
                                                                                                       

   RESTITUTION FROM EAST GERMANY
                                                                                                       

   East Germany agreed to return property and other assets
that its governments since 1949 have confiscated from
citizens and refugees, West German government officials said.
   Rudolf Seiters, chief of staff for Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
said such property owners also can apply for financial
compensation for damages.
   The agreement came about as part of the economic and
monetary unification of the two Germanys set for July 1. It
doesn't cover property confiscated during the 1945-1949
Soviet administration of the territory that later became East
Germany. The Soviets and East Germans balked at that idea,
Mr. Seiters said.
   The pact does state that should a single parliament be
formed to govern both Germanys, the question of compensation
or return of assets seized between 1945 and 1949 would be
readdressed.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .

   Careers Start Giving In to Family Needs

   The workaholic generation is working to put its family
life back on track.
   After a decade of career obsession, more professionals and
managers are balking at grueling hours, frequent travel and
family neglect. There's a push for equilibrium between work
and home, even at a cost of lost promotions and pay.

   And that means pressing often reluctant companies for more
work schedule options. Last week, the Senate approved
legislation already passed by the House that would require
companies to give workers up to 12 weeks annual unpaid leave
for childbirth, adoption or serious family illnesses. But
President Bush has threatened to veto it, saying such
benefits should be offered voluntarily. Business groups
likewise oppose the measure and say many companies already
offer such benefits.
   Even if it survives to become a law, the legislation
covers only special circumstances, and many employees say
day-to-day problems need addressing, too. To achieve balance,
some are negotiating part-time jobs or switching to
slower-paced careers. Others are staying in full-time jobs
but limiting business travel and their daily schedules.
   "Unless I'm inventing a cure for AIDS, unless I'm really
making a major social contribution, it's not worth missing my
daughter growing up," says Judy Pesin, 38 years old, who once
worked 12-hour days as a vice president of Citicorp but
switched to part-time work there after the birth of her child
four years ago. "I'm good at what I do, but delivering $50
million in banker's acceptances isn't worth the tradeoff."
   For the most part, it's women who are leading the push for
flexible work schedules, and getting them at a small but
growing number of companies. The drive is especially evident
for baby boomer women in their 30s and early 40s who've had
fewer and later-born children, and now want to invest as much
energy in their progeny as their deals.
   Consider Joan Cohlan, 35, who after her son was born
continued to work a frenetic pace as a marketing executive at
Citicorp. When she wasn't at the office, she was out-of-town
on business or grappling with a 90-minute commute. "The
challenge was to be like a man," she says. "But I missed the
first three years of my son's life." So she quit to do
consulting work from her home, and to learn she was "capable
of being a good mother."
   When her son was five, Ms. Cohlan took a full-time
management job at Nynex Corp. nearer to her home in White
Plains, N.Y., and tries to limit her daily work schedule to
10 hours. She believes she has the best of both worlds now --
a professional challenge coupled with family support. She
earns less than she did at Citicorp, so she and her husband
have shelved home-renovation plans, deferred vacations and
frequent dinners out. But she's gained "a sense of family."
   Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, a research firm, noted a
similar shift in its annual surveys of American values and
life style. "We're finding that having it all and doing it
all is neither desirable nor practical," says Barbara Caplan,
the vice president of the firm. Both women and men are
beginning to "reassess" tradeoffs between work and family,
she says.
   Many women are still deeply committed to work, but "the
issue here is options," Ms. Caplan says. And "while men don't
want to be Mr. Moms, they're rethinking how much of their
family lives, friends and leisure they're willing to give
up."
   In fact, more than half of 500 men polled recently by
Robert Half International, the executive recruiting firm,
said they'd be willing to cut their salaries as much as 25%
to have more family or personal time; about 45% said they'd
likely turn down a promotion if it meant spending less time
with their families.
   Paul Whitehead, a 39-year-old attorney at the United
Steelworkers union in Pittsburgh, has strong memories of
"hearing the back door shut in our house every day at 4:52
p.m., hearing my dad walk into the front hall and kiss my mom
hello. I associate my happy childhood with a father who was
home." Mr. Whitehead used to routinely put in 70 hours a week
at work. But since he married and subsequently had a son
three years ago, he's learned to do more in fewer hours, so
there's time left over for family.
   Not all bosses or colleagues understand, however.
Switching to the balanced track is a risky proposition that
almost always includes a price -- a cut in pay perhaps or
loss of a promotion. Sometimes it's a decline in career
status, or respect. "If you acknowledge that you like to
spend a lot of time with your family, you risk being seen as
not sufficiently dedicated to your job," says David
Machlowitz, who left a New York law firm three years ago for
a less-frenetic corporate counsel's job.
   He still works long days and travels out-of-town on
business, but he has "more control over scheduling," he says.
Nevertheless, after talking openly about his career switch, a
co-worker in another department sent his boss a snide note
saying, "Gee, can I get a job in your department?"
   Mr. Machlowitz warns those who want more time outside work
to "make sure you'll be judged on the basis of what you
accomplish rather than the mere hours you spend in the
office, even if you spend them talking about football or
office gossip."
   Indeed, many companies still equate high performance with
physical presence at work, rather than contributions, leaving
employees with responsibilities for children or elderly
relatives at a "distinct disadvantage," says Fran Rodgers,
president of Work/Family Directions, a Watertown, Mass.,
consulting firm.
   Linda Ortwein, a principal at Kurt Salwyn Associates, a
New York management consulting company, has squeezed her
weekly work load into a four-day, 40-hour schedule since her
daughter turned one. While her productivity hasn't slipped,
she believes that "in the short term I may not have the same
opportunities to advance." And although she often works at
home in the evenings, she worries about whether her staff
feels resentful when she leaves the office each day at 6 p.m.
   Slowing down in times of managerial and cost cutbacks can
be chancy, too. Says one Wall Street skeptic: "If your firm
is going through a 20% cutback, do you want to be the first
one to say you want part-time work?"
   Most corporations are only beginning to come to grips with
tensions in the modern work force, where more than half of
women return to their jobs within a year of having a child
and 60% of employed men have employed wives. Yet the
high-cost of replacing experienced employees and other
economic factors are propelling companies to offer more
family-supportive policies. A survey of 259 major employers
by Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm, shows that
55% offer some form of child-care aid, 31% provide elder-care
aid, 56% have flexible scheduling, 42% offer unpaid parental
leave and 14% provide adoption benefits.
   "Companies are being pressured to accommodate more -- but
they're reacting with schizophrenic sensitivity," says
Kathleen Christensen, a City University of New York professor
who surveyed flexible scheduling at 521 U.S. corporations.
"They say sure you can work at home as long as you do 80
hours a week, or they give one person part time, but don't
reduce that person's work load."
   And even compressed work schedules don't leave very much
time for families. Gloria Jacobs works four days a week as a
senior editor at New York Woman magazine. But on those four
days, she says, "I come home beat to kids who are also tired.
There's really no life with them during the week." She also
worries she may not be there for guidance. "There's a lot
going on at school -- racial tensions, boy-girl issues -- and
{my eight-year-old daughter} wants to talk about it when she
gets out for the day, not at 7:30 at night."
   Others believe some jobs simply can't be done on
flex-time. Marlee Myers, a partner at Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart
in Pittsburgh, says she's had to accept that her corporate
practice can't fit into a part-time or even normal full-time
work schedule. "You don't know if you'll be working until 10
p.m. or 2 a.m. or around the clock -- but you have to do
whatever it takes to get the deal done."
   She's able to do that, she acknowledges, because her
husband, a free-lance writer, can always be home for dinner
with their two children, ages seven and 10. Ms. Myers is also
"skeptical" about what critics deride as "the mommy track,"
and wonders if part-timers can really get ahead. "You can be
a part-time lawyer and not do the kind of work I do, but to
me it's not the most challenging work. You have to make a
choice, and there's a price you pay."
   That ability to make a choice is the point for many, and
it looks as if it may become available to more employees as
time goes on. Peter Friedes, chief executive of Hewitt
Associates, the benefits consulting firm, believes that over
the next 20 years a "normal career" will be replaced by
"multiple paths that people will take trying to be good
workers and good parents." Companies will operate like ski
resorts, he believes, with multiple starting points, paths
and ending points at the bottom of the mountain. "Even the
idea of stopping half way down the mountain for lunch seems
applicable to a career," he says.
   Laura Meyer, a 39-year-old Citicorp manager, felt her own
half-way stop was an enjoyable pause in a demanding career.
After her second child was born two years ago, she took a
one-year leave from her job as director of investor relations
to spend more time with her family. And because she'd left
her job "in a senior capacity with good exposure," returning
to another senior position was no problem.
   Similarly Susan Reid Morris, a 35-year-old Washington,
D.C., attorney who switched from full-time to a part-time
position after the birth of her daughter, says her path has
already produced a payoff for her daughter's future. "When
she's asked what she wants to do when she grows up, she says
she wants to be a lawyer and a mommy. In her mind, she's sure
it can work out."

<LP>
   In his June 14 editorial-page article ("Stop Bashing
Program Trading"), Dean Furbush, an economic adviser to the
chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
criticized the SEC's Division of Market Regulation report and
argued that we should "stop bashing program trading." Mr.
Furbush misstates our position on index arbitrage and misses
the main factual conclusions.
   It has never been the position of the SEC or the division
that program trading or index arbitrage causes extreme
volatility in the market. Indeed, the division emphasized in
its report regarding Oct. 13, 1989 -- when the securities
markets lost $190 billion in market value, $160 billion of
which was lost in the space of just 90 minutes -- that the
triggering event for the decline was the announcement that
financing for a buy-out of United Airlines had fallen through
with predictable effects on potential takeover activity.
These are not opinions, they are simply facts regarding what
actually happened that day.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What the division's market reconstruction actually did
find was that, from the UAL announcement to the close of Oct.
13, index arbitrage and other program selling on the New York
Stock Exchange accounted for nearly 27% of S&amp;P 500 stock
volume. Moreover, program selling accounted for 36% of S&amp;P
volume when the futures were not subject to price limits and
reached levels as high as 50%. These aggregate levels were
substantially higher than the aggregate program trading
levels during the market crash of October 1987.
   The division found that index arbitrage has the effect of
concentrating selling activity in a time period in which
market participants are not always capable of responding
effectively. Moreover, even when index arbitrage is not
flooding the stock market, the "billboard effect" of
plummeting index futures can lead to additional selling and
discourage buying interest. To use Mr. Furbush's automobile
metaphor, when prices are falling rapidly, index arbitrage
can act like a turbocharger on a car engine. The driver has
to press the gas pedal, but once the pedal is pressed the
turbocharger causes the car to accelerate far more rapidly.
   Our finding that index arbitrage will "accelerate" market
declines isn't new. Since 1986 we have concluded in every
study of volatility that program trading and index arbitrage
compress the time in which market moves occur from days to
hours and -- in the case of Oct. 13, 1989 -- minutes. Index
arbitrage, however, is not the end of the story, it is the
beginning.
   Because of its structure and leverage, the stock-index
futures market has assumed a price leadership role. Arbitrage
trading acts, in effect, as a bridge transferring potent
price swings from the futures markets to the stock market. As
such, it highlights the need to scrutinize carefully not the
transmission belt of arbitrage trading, but the underlying
trading practices and dynamics of the futures market that may
encourage periods of extreme price volatility. While Mr.
Furbush ignores this question, there are a number of relevant
findings in the division's report.
   -- Index-futures selling on Oct. 13 was dominated by
short-term traders. The division found futures selling was
focused in small and large speculative accounts, foreign
accounts (mostly speculative short-term trading accounts) and
options-market-maker accounts.
   -- Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor traders ("locals")
did not provide net liquidity to the market. Throughout the
critical period between 2:40 p.m. and 4:15 p.m. locals were
net sellers in seven out of nine 10-minute periods. This does
not compare well with stock specialists who were net buyers
of stock during that period.
   -- A number of transactions classified as index arbitrage
were not executed contemporaneously, as bona-fide arbitrage
transactions normally are. These "legging" transactions --
where one side of the transaction is completed before the
other -- are really speculative trading in arbitrage clothing
and can have a substantially destabilizing impact on the
market.
   These findings underline concerns the commission has
expressed over the operation and regulation of the
stock-index futures market. It simply makes no sense for
fundamentally interlinked markets to have different
regulators.
   Moreover, the high levels of speculative trading on Oct.
13 explain why the commission along with the chairman of the
Federal Reserve and the secretary of the Treasury all believe
that levels of stock-index futures margin as low as 2.2% are
simply unsafe for our markets.
   How can we address these problems without crippling the
futures industry? We strongly believe that the bill recently
introduced by the administration would accomplish these dual
objectives.
   By giving a federal agency oversight of stock-index
futures margins -- oversight that exists now with respect to
stocks and options, but not futures -- the bill would ensure
that stock-index futures margins never again would fall to
irresponsibly low levels that can jeopardize the stability of
stock and futures markets. At the same time, by transferring
jurisdiction over stock-index futures to the SEC, the
proposal would reduce costs to market participants,
facilitate regulatory coordination, and improve efforts to
detect and deter fraud in the stock and the futures markets.
   As a bonus, the administration's bill would negate the
anti-competitive effects of the so-called "exclusivity
clause" of the commodities laws. This would allow securities
exchanges and corporate issuers to offer investors products
that are forbidden from trading anywhere but on a futures
exchange. To invest in these products today, investors must
look to our competitors in Europe and Canada.
   In short, the bill would improve dramatically the current
regulatory environment while significantly reducing costs to
market participants. Most important, both market stability
and protection against intermarket fraud would be improved
for the 50 million Americans who have invested in U.S.
securities markets.

   Tokyo Stocks Decline on Index-Linked Selling
   Amid Light Trading; London Shares Also Fall

   Tokyo stock prices finished lower in light trading Friday
on index-linked selling in the last half hour of trading.
   The Nikkei index of 225 issues, which advanced 296.34
points Thursday, was down 129.71 points at 32538.40.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   London shares were moderately lower.
   Tokyo stock prices moved in a narrow range most of the
day, as investors remained on the sidelines ahead of releases
of U.S. economic indicators later Friday, traders said.
   Investors picked up laggards among pharmaceutical,
machinery and food sectors as well as small-capitalization
second-section stocks. Shipbuilding, construction and
electrical shares, meanwhile, ended mostly lower.
   In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index rose
88.85 points to 32627.25.
   Friday's volume on the first section was estimated at 450
million shares, in line with 456.2 million Thursday.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues 477-443,
while 198 remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which gained 21.56 points Thursday, was down
3.65 points, or 0.15%, at 2396.32.
   The second section index gained for the fourth consecutive
day. The index, which advanced 19.87 points Thursday, was up
47.61 points, or 1.16%, to close at 4153.60.
   Volume in the second section was estimated at 33 million
shares, up from 26.7 million Thursday.
   "The first section trading was lackluster," said Shigeru
Akima, head of equity trading at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
International. "Little money is coming into the section, and
investors are passing off the time by trading in small-cap
stocks on the second section with bright earnings outlooks,"
he said.
   In addition to the second-section stocks, traders said,
high-priced shares on the Osaka and Nagoya stock exchanges
advanced strongly, drawing buy orders from investors going
after these smaller stocks that often move up significantly
on relatively small amounts of buying.
   Trading in large-capitalization shares on the first
section requires encouraging factors such as a sign of lower
interest rates, traders said.
   Even a favorable market "mood" such as expecting the yen's
rise or interest rates to fall would be helpful, said Atsushi
Koishihara, general manager of stock trading at Taiheiyo
Securities. "Everybody is waiting to see such a cue," he
said.
   Expectations of lower U.S. interest rates grew last week,
triggered by Wednesday's report of unexpectedly low U.S.
retail sales for May and fueled by Thursday's remarks by U.S.
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that U.S.
interest rates will fall "very significantly" if a credible
budget-deficit reduction accord is reached.
   "But after all, investors are unable to tell which way
rates are heading," said a senior trader at Dai-Ichi
Securities.
   Traders predicted that stock trading for this week will
depend largely on how the foreign exchange market reacts to
the latest U.S. economic data.
   Pharmaceutical shares, which had been lagging in recent
weeks, bounced back Friday as investors shifted their
attention from shipbuilding and electrical shares, both of
which had been traded actively earlier in the week, traders
said.
   Dainippon Pharmaceutical went up 400 yen ($2.59) a share
to 3,210 yen, Mochida gained 80 to 3,950, and Daiichi
Pharmaceutical rose 100 to 2,500.
   Also higher were retail issues such as Isetan, which
advanced 120 to 4,480, textile shares such as Kurabo, which
increased 52 to 1,000, and Kuraray, which was up 60 at 1,550.
   Shipbuilding and steel shares advanced through midday but
ended lower on late profit-taking, traders said.
   Electrical stocks also softened. Sony dropped 60 to 8,510,
while Sharp declined 20 to 1,880.
   London share prices finished a sluggish session moderately
lower amid disappointment over the latest U.S. and U.K.
economic figures and a soggy early performance on Wall
Street.
   Traders termed the session frustrating, as many had
awaited the outcome of the U.K. data for most of the week as
well as a slew of U.S. figures.
   But the indicators caused little stir in the market, with
many traders closing their books early for the weekend.
"There was such a great buildup to Friday that we thought
we'd see some action," said one trader. "But it just didn't
happen."
   U.K. inflation figures for May showed that the retail
price index rose 0.9% from April and was up 9.7% on a
year-on-year basis, compared with expectations of a 9.5%
increase.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was down 10.7 points at 2392.3, up from its
midafternoon low of 2387.4 but well below the early morning
peak of 2414.4.
   The final calculation of the narrower FT-30 share index
showed a 2.7-point drop to 1925.9. Volume amounted to a
modest 400.2 million shares, compared with 554.2 million
Thursday.
   Reuters shares chalked up the largest advance on the day,
surging 44 pence (75 cents) to #12.94 ($22.10). Dealers
suggested a stock shortage forced the price higher, while
talk also circulated that the company will win the contract
to provide the electronic dealing system for the American
Stock Exchange in New York.
   Polly Peck surged 16 to 435 after a series of bullish
presentations to analysts in the U.S., dealers said.
   Securities house Smith New Court reported pretax profit
for the year to April 27 rose 115% from year-earlier levels.
Its shares finished 5 higher at 106.
   Employment services concern Manpower, formerly known as
Blue Arrow, slipped 1 to 86 after reporting six-month interim
pretax profit down 14%. The results were worse than expected,
analysts said.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in Paris, Brussels,
Amsterdam, Milan and Madrid. Prices were mixed in Frankfurt,
Zurich and Stockholm. South African gold stocks closed lower.
   Share prices closed lower in Sydney, Taipei and Seoul and
higher in Manila, Wellington, Singapore and Hong Kong.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.

   Sisters, Los Albertos
   Settle on Running
   Big Spanish Concern

   MADRID -- The Koplowitz sisters get the construction
companies. Los Albertos get the finance firms.
   That, roughly, is the result of a settlement affecting one
of Spain's biggest private business empires, Construcciones y
Contratas S.A.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a pact ending months of wrangling, principal owners
Esther and Alicia Koplowitz agreed with their estranged
husbands, Alberto Alcocer and Alberto Cortina, known in Spain
as los Albertos, to divide the empire into the two zones of
influence. To maintain the group as an entity and avoid
possible fiscal charges, however, no shares are expected to
change hands. One result is intended to be the concern's
future passing to the two couples' six children, three on
either side.
   The nucleus of the group, Construcciones y Contratas, was
founded by Ernesto Koplowitz, the father of Esther and
Alicia, as a public works contractor in the 1940s. In the
1970s and 1980s, under the management of their husbands, who
are cousins, it grew to be one of Spain's most powerful
private business empires. But it failed in its most ambitious
project, launched in 1987, to gain control of Banco Central,
then Spain's biggest bank. The business conflict that ensued
led to tensions within the group, contributing ultimately to
the breakdown of the two couples' marriages.
   Under the agreement, the Koplowitz sisters will retain
control of Construcciones y Contratas, the construction
company Fomento de Obras y Construcciones S.A., the cement
company Portland Valderrivas S.A. and about 50 other
companies. Los Albertos will take charge of the group's
stakes in Banco Zaragozano, in Carlo De Benedetti's Spanish
holding company Cofir and in the planned Spanish
pay-television station Canal Plus, and will retain their
plush offices on the 43rd floor of Madrid's Torre Picasso,
owned by Portland Valderrivas, and two country estates. The
holdings involved have an estimated value of 10.6 billion
pesetas ($101.3 million).
   The pact brings to a close one of the most passion-filled
chapters of Spain's recent business history. Los Albertos
made repeated headlines in the past 2 1/2 years, first with
their abortive bid for Banco Central and later because of
their amorous affairs. They were the subject of a page-one
article in The Wall Street Journal in December.

   Reebok Itself May Be Most LIkely Buyer
   For Pentland's 31.5% Stake in Company

   Reebok International Ltd. itself is the most likely buyer
for the 31.5% stake in the company put on the block by
Pentland Group PLC, its largest shareholder, analysts say.
   Several analysts speculated that London-based Pentland
will shop the block around for several months, but find few
bidders because of the limitations on what a buyer could do
with the shares. However, the effort may help determine a
fair price. "I think it's a dance to determine price," said
Gary Jacobson, footwear analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
"Pentland feels it's worth a premium. Reebok probably
doesn't," he said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Reebok disclosed Pentland's plan late Thursday, and
simultaneously announced new takeover defenses. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Reebok rose 50 cents
to $18.50. At that price, Pentland's 36.2 million shares of
Reebok would be worth about $670 million.
   U.S. analysts struggled to come up with names of companies
that might be interested in acquiring a minority stake in a
maker of trendy footwear. They noted that standstill
agreements would prohibit a buyer from expanding its stake.
In addition, Reebok's second biggest holder, Chairman Paul
Fireman, who owns 14.5% of the firm's stock, has a right of
first refusal on the Pentland shares.
   In a telephone interview Friday, Frank Farrant, finance
director of Pentland, a footwear trading firm, said "we have
a list of people that we intend to contact" about possibly
buying the stake. He declined to identify then or provide the
timing of any sale. He said Pentland plans to sell the stock
as a block in order "to get strategic value for it."
   Mr. Farrant, who also sits on Reebok's board, emphasized
that Pentland was ending its relationship amicably. He said
Pentland originally invested $77,000 in Reebok in 1981 and
has realized #37 million ($63.2 million) through previous
sales of Reebok shares.
   The executive said Pentland is disposing of its remaining
Reebok shares because it doesn't reap cash flow from a
minority position, only dividends. Reebok pays a quarterly
dividend of 7.5 cents a share. Mr. Farrant added: "We don't
want to take the money and run. We want to take the money and
invest it in a business that will give us cash flow." But he
conceded that Pentland won't easily find another growth stock
like Reebok: "The reality of life is you only are blessed
once."
   Pentland has hired S.G. Warburg &amp; Co., London, to help it
sell its Reebok stake. Reebok has hired First Boston Corp., a
New York investment banking firm, to advise it, according to
Wall Street executives. First Boston declined comment.
   A Warburg official indicated that Pentland expects to
receive offers for its Reebok shares from companies outside
the U.S. which could help Reebok grow abroad. "We think it is
important to help Reebok to grow in international markets and
I think that's where a lot of interest will come from," the
Warburg official said.
   The Warburg official declined to comment on whether
Pentland had asked Reebok to buy its holdings, or how Reebok
might have responded.
   Pentland decided to sell its Reebok shares now because a
series of contracts under which Pentland supplies Reebok with
merchandise expire this year, the Warburg official said.
   If Reebok does end up buying back the shares it would be
good for Reebok holders because it would "shrink the market
capitalization and accelerate the earnings gains," said Alice
Ruth, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
She said Reebok has ample cash flow to support borrowing
money to buy back the Pentland block. She calculated that if
Reebok bought the Pentland stake at $20 a share it would cost
about $82 million in annual interest costs, well below the
company's estimated $250 million in available annual cash
flow, she said.
   Ms. Ruth said Reebok's value in a takeover might be as
high as $24 to $26 a share, but she said she considers a
takeover unlikely.
   Heidi Steinberg, who follows specialty retailing for
Salomon Bros., said that in a hostile takeover, "Reebok would
be more than a $2 billion purchase. The companies that could
afford it wouldn't be interested. Those who would be
interested couldn't afford it. I don't think Reebok is likely
to be put into play."
   However, Dennis Rosenberg, a special situations analyst
with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said the Pentland plan "definitely"
puts Reebok in play. He said that between its substantial
cash flow and its well-known brand name, the company would be
attractive to acquirers who might bid for the Pentland block.
He speculated that such a bidder would want to make an offer
for the entire company, despite Mr. Fireman's wish that it
remain independent.
   "Fireman has to act in the interests of all the
shareholders," Mr. Rosenberg said.

   NEW YORK -- Small investors can sometimes punish their
brokers in court even when they make big bucks.
   At least that's the message from the Eighth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in St. Paul, Minn. In a 3-0 decision, the
court Friday upheld a $2 million punitive damage award
against Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in an unusual excessive-trading
case involving the account of a deceased widow.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Merrill, the nation's largest securities firm, says it is
"greatly disappointed" with the decision, and may appeal. One
reason: The investor's account actually rose 50% during the
time of the complaint, Merrill Lynch says.
   It's rare that investors are awarded punitive damages when
they haven't suffered monetary losses, securities lawyers
say. "It's extraordinary," says Sam Scott Miller, a former
general counsel at PaineWebber Group Inc. and currently a
partner at Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe in New York.
   Punitive damages are generally awarded to punish and deter
a defendant found to have acted recklessly or maliciously.
(Most cases involving punitive damages occur when investors'
nest eggs have been depleted.) Punitive damages are applied
in addition to awards intended to compensate for actual
injury or loss.
   The award for the estate of Ethlyn Davis, the investor,
also included $100,000 in compensatory damages. Merrill Lynch
said the $2.1 million total has been "previously reserved
for." A federal jury awarded the amount in Sioux Falls, S.D.,
in August 1988.
   In court papers, Mrs. Davis alleged that from February
1982 to August 1984 former Merrill Lynch broker Steven Ulrich
"churned" her account, which had an average balance of
$144,000, by making 141 trades totaling $2 million. Churning
is excessive trading in a customer's account by a broker
solely to generate commissions.
   Despite the heavy trading, Merrill says in court papers
that the account actually made a net profit of more than
$53,000. But the appellate panel, in a 42-page decision,
said: "The gravity of the wrong committed by Merrill Lynch is
not mitigated by the fact that the account was nevertheless
profitable."
   Mr. Ulrich was terminated in August 1984 after other
customers complained of unauthorized trading in their
accounts, a Merrill Lynch spokesman says. Mrs. Davis died in
November 1986 at age 91.
   Arlo Sommervold, a lawyer for Mrs. Davis's estate, says
Mr. Ulrich should have made much more for his client,
contending that stocks were rising for much of the time the
alleged excessive trading took place. He says punitive
damages were justified.
   "You can't rob a bank and then, if they catch you, just
give the money back and everyone's even," Mr. Sommervold
says. "She's entitled to all the money she should have
earned."

   Seven Journalists
   File $330 Million
   Suit Against Atex

   NEW YORK -- Journalists from five newspapers and a news
service sued Eastman Kodak Co.'s Atex electronic-publishing
unit for $330 million, claiming that using the Atex computer
system at work caused them permanent injuries.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleged
that Atex knew the computer system could pose health risks,
such as injuries to the wrists and arms, from repetitive use.
The lawsuit accused the company of negligence in not
notifying users of the risks or changing the computer system,
which is used for reporting and editing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The lawsuit said Atex "disregarded medical and scientific
information, studies, tests, data and literature concerning
the causal relationship between the repetitive use of
computer systems and cumulative trauma disorders," as the
ailments are known.
   A spokesman for Atex said the company hadn't seen the
suit. He said the company doesn't comment on issues that are
in litigation. Eastman Kodak, the parent company, isn't named
as a defendant.
   The plaintiffs are seven journalists working for both the
New York and Long Island editions of Newsday, Discount Store
News, the Village Voice, American Banker and the Associated
Press, and one former American Banker reporter. Three of the
plaintiffs' spouses also are plaintiffs, seeking additional
damages for the loss of the journalists' support.
   The journalists claim their injuries prevent them from
pursuing normal activities and employment. The injuries
include carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis and nerve
disorders, the lawsuit said.
   In the lawsuit, the journalists also alleged that the
computer system -- including the keyboard and video display
terminal -- was defectively designed. A similar suit was
filed against Atex in state court in Manhattan earlier this
month by three other Newsday reporters.

   Hershey Foods, Jell-O Are Mixing It Up
   As Refrigerated Pudding War Gets Hot

   Hershey Foods Corp. is betting that its chocolate-bar
taste can take a big bite of the rapidly growing market for
refrigerated pudding.
   But the market leader, Jell-O, is flexing its muscle to
show the new kid on the block who runs the neighborhood.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We intend to defend our share ferociously, with
everything we've got," declares Dana Gioia, marketing manager
for Jell-O desserts at Kraft General Foods, a unit of Philip
Morris Cos. "We take the competition very seriously, and we
don't intend to make life easy" for Hershey.
   One of the fastest-growing categories in the supermarket,
refrigerated pudding is expected to rack up sales of $300
million this year, compared with only $55 million in 1987.
Packaging improvements are helping to boost sales, and many
consumers prefer ready-to-eat desserts and snacks. Moreover,
dry pudding mixes are waning in popularity because they
require extra time to cool.
   Until early this year, the refrigerated category had been
dominated by only two players, Kraft's Jell-O brand and
Beatrice Co.'s Swiss Miss. Hershey, hoping to exploit its
famous chocolate name, identified a promising pudding niche
for itself. Beatrice is a unit of ConAgra Inc.
   Without test-marketing its new product, Hershey quietly
began its national rollout in New England stores in January,
offering what it promoted as four "chocolate bar flavors you
can eat with a spoon": Hershey's Bar, Hershey's Bar with
Almonds, York Peppermint Pattie and Hershey's Kisses
Chocolate. Hershey introduced the pudding line soon after
that in the West and this month in the mid-Atlantic states.
   But Kraft, which says it has captured 57% of the national
market since its 1987 entry, is responding aggressively to
the new competition. Immediately after Hershey's pudding
packs appeared on the racks, Kraft began airing TV
commercials with longtime Jell-O spokesman Bill Cosby leading
the counterattack.
   In one television ad, Mr. Cosby warns pudding-eaters about
an unnamed "Johnny-Come-Lately." Asks Mr. Cosby: "What does
it have that Jell-O Pudding Snacks don't? Tropical oils and
artificial flavors." In addition to the ads, Kraft is pasting
stickers on its pudding packages, encouraging the consumer to
"read the label." Kraft says Jell-O is made mostly with skim
milk and contains no preservatives, artificial flavors or
tropical oils.
   Hershey didn't like the Cosby ad. "They called us up" to
complain, says Kraft's Mr. Gioia. "I think Hershey has been
surprised by the ferocity of our competitive response."
   "I'm a little bit suprised by some tactics of the Jell-O
campaign," said Peter Tate, executive vice president of
D.D.B. Needham Worldwide, the ad agency handling the Hershey
pudding account. He said Kraft "has chosen an issue which is
at best temporal and at worst irrelevant."
   Pudding-slinging aside, Hershey is encouraged by the early
results. John McMillin, a food-industry analyst at Prudential
Bache, estimates that Hershey has captured 15% of the markets
where it competes and holds about an 8% share nationwide. The
product line "is meeting or exceeding customer sales
projections," says Grace Thomas, marketing director of
Hershey's Venture Group, which developed the pudding.
   But a few weeks ago, Hershey eliminated coconut oil from
its pudding formulas and began using a non-tropical oil
instead. Hershey insists that the Cosby campaign wasn't the
impetus for the recipe change. "We have taken our time," says
Ms. Thomas. "The process has been under way for a year and a
half now." Hershey's newly formulated pudding is ecpected to
be available by late summer.
   Hershey plans a new advertising campaign to inform
consumers of the change, although Ms. Thomas says Hershey
will refrain from attacks on Jell-O or Swiss Miss. "It's not
the type of advertising we do," she said. "It doesn't fit
with our philosophy."
   Meanwhile, Kraft says it has more tough-talking ads in the
works. When the pudding market revives from its usual summer
slump, "Hershey will recognize the seriousness of our
commitment," Kraft's Mr. Gioia says.
   For its part, Beatrice is sitting back and enjoying the
fracas. The entry of Jell-O and Hershey has "been a good
thing for us, and our business has grown," says Dick Nathan,
marketing manager for the Swiss Miss line, which has an
estimated 30% of the market. Swiss Miss, the oldest big
competitor in the category, sells at a significantly lower
price than the two other brands.
   With the refrigerated pudding category expected to
continue its rapid growth (in the past 12 months, Beatrice
estimates total sales volume rose 40%), there seems to be
little need for the Hershey-Kraft squabbling.
   "Hershey has ridden on Jell-O's coattails," said
Prudential Bache's Mr. McMillin. "But there's enough growth
in the category for everyone."

   Book Publishers' Sales Growth Forecast
   At 8.3% Annually for Next Five Years
   ----

   NEW YORK -- Despite turbulent times marked by lots of
executive changes and several big write-downs, book
publishers are enjoying healthy sales, which are expected to
continue to grow about 8.3% a year for the next five years,
according to a new industry survey.
   The Book Industry Study Group, a trade group with members
including publishers, manufacturers and distributors of
books, is releasing its annual Book Industry Trends survey
today. The group forecasts "steady growth" in book sales for
the next five years, though at a slightly lower rate than in
the past several years. Total U.S. book sales, excluding
exports, are expected to reach $21.1 billion by 1994 from an
estimated $13.1 billion in 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the survey states that the sales advances "will be due
far more to price advances than to increased unit sales."
Thus, the expected 8.3% annual increase in book sales
translates to an average 3.1% rise in unit sales. For most of
the '80s, total book sales rose about 8.4% a year, with the
growth rate shooting up to 8.8% from 1985 to 1989.
   Breaking down the forecast by categories, the group said
it expects the substantial gains of the 1980s to continue for
professional, trade (general-interest fiction and
non-fiction) and especially juvenile (from toddler to teen)
books. Juvenile books have been growing faster than any other
category, about 17% a year for the past five years, and by
1994, they sales are expected to account for more than 25% of
all trade books.
   Because of the economic crunch in many public school
budgets and the cyclical nature of textbook adoption in major
states, school books are expected to show the slowest growth,
increases of only 6.6% in sales and 1% in unit sales. The
group forecast only modest growth in mail-order books, which
could be hurt further by expected postal rate increases.
   Seymour Turk, treasurer of the Book Industry Study Group,
said publishers got "unnecessarily nervous" in late 1989,
because a huge jump in sales of general-interest books from
1988 to 1989 was followed by a decline in sales growth and by
climbing numbers of books returned unsold from bookstores.
   Industry specialists said publishers became
over-aggressive in recent years in the advances paid to
authors and in the initial number of copies printed. Then,
when the growth of the big bookstore chains slowed in the
late '80s, the pipeline more or less backed up, and
publishers weren't prepared for it. The sense of crisis in
publishing was further fed by the continuing consolidation
after a period of big publishing mergers; some big publishing
houses are still saddled with heavy debt loads and some have
cut staffs.
   Still, the optimism of the forecast doesn't surprise
Robert Di Romualdo, chief executive officer of Book Inventory
Systems Inc. of Ann Arbor, Mich., which operates 10 enormous
bookstores and supplies books for other megabookstores
stocking about 100,000 titles.
   "Our sales have been healthy for a long time," Mr. Di
Romualdo said. "We hear so much about illiteracy and the
drop-out rate that we tend to forget there are more college
graduates in this country today than ever before. And there
are more categories of books than ever before. There's been
explosive growth in areas like self-help, medical and
science, computer books, cookbooks, diet books and all kinds
of gift books. Women today wouldn't consider having a baby
without buying 10 books about it." More than 57,000 titles
were published in 1989; the total has been edging up for
years.
   Also unsurprised by the forecast is Richard Snyder,
chairman of Paramount Communications Inc.'s Simon &amp; Schuster,
who said press coverage of the publishing industry in 1989
focused too much on short-term upheaval at a handful of
publishing houses. "We are still in a golden age of book
buying," Mr. Snyder said. People who are between the ages of
35 and 50 buy the most books, he said, noting that many baby
boomers now fall within that range. "That's prime book-buying
time," he said. "They are affluent enough to buy books and
they are educated and read more. They also buy a lot of books
for their children, much more than previous generations."
   Simon &amp; Schuster took a $140 million write-off in its past
fiscal year, mainly related to the adoption of more
conservative accounting methods for educational publishing,
and Mr. Snyder conceded that in trade publishing, the company
"had been profligate, as had many other companies," spending
too much on advances and printing too many copies. But he
said the company has become much more disciplined, publishing
more selectively and becoming more efficient in a variety of
areas, including manufacturing and order-taking.
   Mr. Snyder agreed with the industry group's robust sales
forecasts for professional, trade and children's books, but
said he believes the forecast for elementary and high school
textbook sales is too low. He said he anticipates some form
of "peace dividend," with money formerly used to fight the
Cold War available for domestic problems. "I don't know how
much money it will be, but I believe some of the money will
be used to strengthen our schools, and that will help
textbook sales," Mr. Snyder said. "This country must educate
its children better to be competitive in the global economy."

   I want to correct a misquote in the May 23 "Heard on the
Street" column regarding Playboy's new recapitalization plan.
For the record, the recapitalization plan does not dilute the
voting power of any shareholder nor change control. It does
provide the company with additional flexibility to use equity
in future acquisitions, financings and employee-benefit
plans, which will benefit all shareholders.
   In my comments regarding the plan and voting rights of
stockholders, the reporter quoted me as saying, "I'm sort of
a believer in one share, one vote," which would be strange
and illogical on the eve of creating a nonvoting class of
stock. What I said was, "I'm a believer in one voting share,
one vote." Anyone who holds voting stock has a right and
responsibility to exercise his vote. This right has been
preserved under Playboy's recapitalization plan, and that is
why we did not disenfranchise the majority shareholder, as
most companies have, in his right to vote on this plan.

   In a potentially serious blow to the union effort to buy
UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, the company's 26,000
nonunionized workers indicated that they might not support
the buy-out.
   The nonunionized workers said they still hope they can
reach an accord with the three unions spearheading the
buy-out effort. Their opposition wouldn't necessarily be a
deal-breaker, but it could pose a public-relations problem
for the buy-out group as it seeks bank financing for the
$4.38 billion offer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Union officials began formal talks with lenders last week.
Banks are already skeptical of the union coalition between
United's pilots, machinists and flight attendants, given the
unions' past disputes. Signs of tension between any of the
labor groups is bound to make the banks even more nervous.
   A union adviser called the disagreement "a tempest in a
teapot" and said talks are expected to resume today.
   The nonunion workers said they had developed a plan under
which they could agree to support the buy-out, but they are
"very disappointed" that the unions have so far refused to
accept it. "We think it is particularly disturbing that {the
buy-out group} has not yet been able to resolve the issues
relating to the non-contract employees." Previously the
nonunion group hadn't taken a stand on the buy-out.
   The dispute centers on two issues. The nonunionized
employees are upset over the buy-out group's refusal to
improve the nonunion pension plan. They also want an overall
agreement with the unions to be binding.
   However, the unions want an agreement in principle that
would give future management the authority to make changes in
the nonunionized workers' compensation, as UAL management has
done in the past. The unions say that the nonunionized
workers have never had a binding contract in the past.
   "We continue to be hopeful that an agreement can be
reached," said Stephen Fraidin of Fried Frank Harris Shriver
&amp; Jacobson, attorneys for the nonunionized group including
reservations clerks, customer-service agents and managers,
about one-third of the work force.
   On another level, the dispute points up the Byzantine
quality of the buy-out negotiations. Just last Friday, the
two sides appeared close to an agreement that included
enhanced pension benefits for the nonunionized group. The
company provided the buy-out group with an estimate of the
cost to make these changes.
   Later, when the union appeared ready to accept the
changes, UAL said its original calculations were wrong and
that the pension plan changes would cost about 30% more than
anticipated. The unions backed away from an agreement, and
the talks stalled.
   Union officials say UAL may be trying to "sandbag" the
buy-out by creating friction between the two labor groups.
They say that UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, who stands to
lose his job if the buy-out succeeds, encouraged the
non-contract workers to hire financial advisers. He
recommended First Chicago Corp.
   Indeed, UAL is paying the fees for First Chicago and Fried
Frank, the non-contract group's legal adviser. The chief
negotiator from First Chicago has past ties to Mr. Wolf and
Ralph Strangis, a UAL director the unions also are planning
to replace.
   First Chicago and Fried Frank deny that they are trying to
frustrate the buy-out effort. They say they want a fair deal
for the non-contract workers, who wouldn't otherwise be
represented in the buy-out negotiations.
   A spokesman for Mr. Wolf said the unions' suggestion that
management of Chicago-based UAL is using the non-contract
employees to try to block a deal is "ludicrous and absurd."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, UAL
shares rose $2 to $157.75. The nonunion statement was issued
yesterday.
   The unions have already said they are willing to reduce
the amount of annual concessions they sought from the
nonunionized workers to about $50 million from $55 million.
In return, the non-contract workers would receive a 14% stake
in UAL. However, the unions maintain that they can finance
the transaction even without a contribution from nonunion
workers.
   The disagreement between the two labor groups poses the
first major test for Gerald Greenwald, who left the No. 2
spot at Chrysler Corp. two weeks ago to lead the buy-out
effort. Mr. Greenwald will have to find a way to smooth over
the differences quickly to avoid any erosion of confidence.
Mr. Greenwald couldn't be reached last night.
   "If this package is not agreed to very shortly by {the
buy-out group}, it does not bode well for its ability to make
business judgments," the nonunionized workers warned in their
statement.

   REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   The Flag and the Community

<LP>
   The U.S. political arena is beginning to look like a
traveling circus. In center ring, the world-famous American
flag-burning controversy. Ring left, we feature a national
argument over the sex-drenched lyrics of a rap group called 2
Live Crew. And in the arts circle there's a nonstop pitched
battle over the erotic photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe.
   The news outlets that describe and in a sense do the
promotion for the actors in these controversies tend to
define them in the same basic terms. It's always a
confrontation between right-wing zealots on one side and free
thinkers and First-Amendment advocates on the other. In a
Flag Day parade in Chicago last week, one sign read: "Make
Our Day -- Try and Burn These Flags, Pinkos," while in front
of the city's Art Institute the Revolutionary Communist Youth
Brigade did burn flags.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When a Cincinnati objects to photos of Robert
Mapplethorpe's most private behavior or when a Chicago
objects to an artist at the local Art Institute laying out
the American flag as a foot-wipe, the signal coming off
nearly every news account in the land of these disagreements
is that folks in Cincinnati and Chicago reflect some
tight-lipped, up-from-the-swamps provincialism. And, the
story line continues, if truth is to prevail, media pressure
and a congenial judge will send them scuttling home, tails
between their legs.
   To a great extent, many of these controversies are largely
scams. They exist because the people who organize them know
that the press and the people in the TV business will provide
publicity. The Broward County, Florida, legal system hasn't
made 2 Live Crew rich and famous; the media have. All such a
group has to do is manage to get arrested, and the media
moguls will descend on them with millions in free
advertising. But of course, the newspapers defending the 2
Live Crew lyrics or the Mapplethorpe photographs somehow
desist from inflicting them on their readers.
   ---
   It's been fun, but maybe it's time to recognize that
something more complex is going on than yet another First
Amendment dispute. We'll admit that some of these issues
arrive in difficult shades of gray, but how did it ever
happen that it is now a settled "right" to spend public money
to promote Robert Mapplethorpe's bullwhip photographs, but an
indisputable "crime" to spend public money on prayer in a
school. Somehow, it seems to us, the country's basic social
and political principles have left the tracks.
   Or rather, perhaps, the principles of the country's
largely self-appointed elites have fundamentally diverged
from the broader public's. Our sense is that the broader
public wants some sense of community; it feels the community
has a right to set some standards. As Harlem political leader
Basil Patterson said recently: "Everything has gotten so
crude. You hear it in the streets all the time, and not just
there. In some of the music you hear now, and on television."
Standards, of course, imply that some things are left in and
some are left out; some things are allowed, some are not. It
is sometimes called having a sense of judgment.
   Against this, elite culture in the U.S. over the past 20
years has developed the position, and presses it every time
one of these flaps arises, that community standards equate
with majority repression of anything that is individual,
iconoclastic, experimental, free. What is primarily at work
here is an assault on the notion of community standards. It
is an attempt to eliminate all the practices and procedures
that civil society in the United States has established to
define itself.
   What's more, this mind-set has its own internal
censorship. Many common-sense liberals have discovered that
they are expected to adhere to a seamless web of ideological
commitments -- flag-burning as politics, Sierra Club
environmentalism, the most extremely militant gay rights,
militant women's rights, animal rights, sexual display as
art, unlimited abortion. Liberals are not only not allowed to
deviate from the claims of their most extreme members on any
of these matters, they will be denounced or driven out if
they do. And so Congress's hapless Democrats end up making a
no-win defense of flag burners.
   It is something of a paradox that these are the people who
claim to be defending independent thinking. For example it is
they, in the torrent of lobbying and reporting around funding
"controversial" programs at the National Endowment for the
Arts, who claim to be holding back the booboisie from the
gates of late 20th-century culture, represented by the
chocolate woman Karen Finley (formerly the yam woman), Andres
Serrano's "Piss Christ," and 2 Live Crew. Culture? Are these
people kidding?
   Further, it is simply foolish to believe that refusing to
give public grants to a Karen Finley is the first step on a
slippery slope to banning "Ulysses." No one is talking about
community standards that legalize oppressions such as
separate racial drinking fountains. They are looking for
standards that help the community's members with the task of
moving forward in a complex world with a moral and political
compass. Denying the community's right to press its views on
flag burning or public obscenity because it might hamper
someone's "individual rights" is to obliterate the very idea
of judgment. Just who are the yahoos here?
   ---
   Sooner or later the political and intellectual leadership
of this country has to wake up to fact that this constant,
recurring tension between these extreme positions and the
American middle class is about something other than the First
Amendment. The flag's man-on-the-street defenders know that
their battle is about something larger than just the flag
itself. And they know that each time the courts, politicians
and press combine to defeat their claims to mainstream
values, civil life in this country somehow ends up more
corrosive and antagonistic.
   We agree that there's something preposterous about
amending the Constitution to prohibit flag burning, but no
more preposterous than the mindset of court rulings that make
such lengths necessary. It is in fact a relatively harmless
way of telling the courts and the intelligentsia they have
tilted too far against community standards. A community has
some rights, and a law against burning the very symbol of
community is not a lot to ask.

   WASHINGTON -- U.S. imports of steel mill products in April
rose 17% from March but remained slightly below the
year-earlier month, according to an American Iron and Steel
Institute compilation of Commerce Department figures.
   Imports in April totaled 1,313,000 tons, compared with
1,120,000 tons in March and 1,341,000 tons in April 1989, the
trade group said. April imports were 16.4% of total steel
consumption, the same percentage as a year earlier but up
from 13.5% in March.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the first four months of 1990, imports totaled
4,975,000 tons, equal to 15.7% of consumption, compared with
5,677,000 tons, or 17% of consumption, a year earlier. The
1990 import share of the market was well below the maximum of
19.1% established under a revised "voluntary" import
restraint system that took effect last Oct. 1.
   Steel exports in April were 335,000 tons, down 8.2% from
March but practically flat with 334,000 tons a year earlier,
the trade group said. For the first four months, exports of
1,388,000 tons were down 3.3% from 1,436,000 tons a year
earlier.

   Your April 24 page-one article "Report Cards: Connecticut
Grades Its Schools and Holds Officials Responsible" is a
tribute to a state that made a commitment to its children and
to the state's own destiny.
   I have found that government can no longer throw money at
a problem and expect it to go away. Illinois spends about $8
billion a year on education. Yet we have a 25% dropout rate
statewide, with 50% in Chicago alone. There are average test
scores, rampant drug abuse and a swollen bureaucracy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So, where's our education policy? What are the goals we're
trying to achieve? How will we know if test scores will climb
and drug use drop? How will we know tax dollars are going
into the classroom and not into the bureaucracy? Why should
we keep throwing money at this problem if we don't know
whether conditions are improving?
   State government must be held accountable for these
failures, especially when children can no longer wait for the
long-overdue federal standards to guide them.

   Caterpillar's Schaefer Set to Pass Reins

   PEORIA, Ill. -- When George A. Schaefer assumed the reins
at Caterpillar Inc. in 1985, Japan's Komatsu Ltd. was on the
move in the construction-equipment industry. It opened a
plant in Tennessee and vowed to wrest market share from the
industry leader.
   Caterpillar pounced back with a plan to virtually remake
its factories: PWAF, for Plant With a Future. The $2 billion
project, coupled with the restraining of price increases,
helped Caterpillar retain its No. 1 position among global
construction equipment companies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But that didn't help profits. In Mr. Schaefer's five years
as chairman and chief executive officer, profit went on a
roller-coaster ride of up, down, up, up and down. Although
Caterpillar says the PWAF payoff will start this year, Mr.
Schaefer won't be around to see it.
   After 39 years at the company, his long-planned retirement
starts July 1, at age 62. Before leaving, he shared his views
about everything from the competition to his wife's critique
of his office decor.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Have you learned anything from Komatsu?
   A: We used to be not overly concerned about Komatsu. That
all changed radically as we moved through the early part of
the '80s and we started to see erosion of our historic market
shares, particularly in North America.
   So I can tell you today that we know all we can legally
know about our friends from Japan. We read everything that's
published. We digest it. We look over their shoulders from
our vantage point in Tokyo, as I'm sure they do from their
vantage point in Peoria. They have a plant right here in
Peoria.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Are you saying you spy on them?
   A: No, I wouldn't say that. We know everything we can
legally know, but we sure don't spy on them. We know they've
had excellent quality. We know they've had a determination to
prevail and grow in this industry. And we know that they are
long-term players. They absolutely are not concerned about
next quarter's profit. They're concerned about market share
and long term.
   For us to maintain the lead in the industry we have to
excel in those areas. That's the reason we aren't the
favorite around Wall Street, although recently the stock has
been moving pretty well considering the earnings pressure
we're under.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Have you felt it was unfair to demand of Caterpillar or
George Schaefer better short-term results?
   A: You can look at that from two different vantage points.
When we sit down with our pension fund managers, we say,
"Well come on, where were you {in performance} last quarter?"
There, we're kind of talking short-term.
   If you look at our situation, we're kind of saying, we
have to be long-term players, or we're not going to be
around.
   I don't think it's unfair. We are making the right
long-term judgments, and if people want to take us to task
for doing that, that's their prerogative.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Why is market share so important?
   A: For us to take a less aggressive stance vis-a-vis
market share means that we lose that long-term stream of
parts and service. Parts are more profitable than prime
product or machines. It's really like the razor blade
business, when you get right down to it.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Why did the cost of your plant modernization program
increase so much over your original projection?
   A: We had an overall blueprint within our own company, but
there was no case study or textbook. We are doing something
very unique in a major manufacturing company. We are
simultaneously restructuring world-wide our manufacturing
processes from A to Z, and it's a gigantic undertaking. We
are 60% to 65% along, but it has cost more to get there, and
it has taken longer than we thought.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Is there a peace dividend for Caterpillar?
   A: We're already seeing some results, faster than we
thought. We recently took our West German dealer and gave him
the East German dealership. And we've sold over 100 machines
in East Germany this year. And I think that's just a start.
   Granted, all these Eastern Bloc countries need the
wherewithal to pay for all this stuff. But you'll see
increasing evidence of the Western countries, Japan and
others willing to make some of the funds available.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Are we losing ground to foreign competitors in
manufacturing?
   A: There isn't any question we were losing ground in the
early '80s, but we've got it stabilized. The advent of the
world-wide competitive situation is making management
everywhere -- not only the U.S.smarter. It's caused us to do
a better job.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Will your domestic work force change in the 1990s?
   A: There's no question. And it will even accelerate
because a lot of these jobs in the plants are being
reoriented to higher-skilled jobs. Running major complexes
with computer assistance means we've got to have
higher-skilled people on those things. We're doing a lot of
training, and a lot of the menial jobs of the past are gone.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Why aren't there more women executives at Caterpillar
today?
   A: It's probably just a function of the industry we're in.
There just aren't that many women engineers. We are seeing
upward movement in some of the other areas -- financial,
specifically. We do recently have a lady running our service
tool company, which is a pretty substantial ancillary. But
the base that we've drawn from has not been there
historically.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Your successor, Donald Fites, has reorganized the
company into profit units. Does this mean the company will be
focusing more on short-term profit than it has in the past?
   A: The tendency will be there to focus more on the short
term because the heads of these profit centers will be
challenged to meet their business plan. As they find they're
having difficulty, they may want to take short-term actions
as the year {goes on}. Therein is the challenge of what we
call the executive office, to make sure that the long-term
interests are being tended to.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Will this mean Caterpillar managers will be worrying
about their jobs more?
   A: In a word, yes.
   The guy that runs that business unit is totally
responsible for product, for design, for engineering, for
manufacturing, for pricing, for everything. And he's got his
target, which is the bottom line of his business unit. And a
fair amount of his compensation will eventually be determined
by how well he meets or exceeds or falls short of that
target. That's never been in our approach.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Can a top executive at an American corporation also be
a good parent?
   A: I think so, but he or she better be very, very specific
in allocating their time and prioritizing their time.
Fortunately, our children were in the formative stages,
through the later grade school and high school, when I was
much less active -- when I was plant manager in Decatur
{Ill.}, for example. I spent a lot of time with my children.
If I had teen-age children and I was a CEO, I would have a
problem trying to find the time they really need -- and
should have.
                                                                                                       

   Q: Will you miss this job?
   A: I'll miss all the fancy ability to pick up the phone
and ask for something. But I tell you, the demands that are
there are such that I'm going to relish some time to reflect
and do some things at a slower pace.

   Q: Who gets this big corner office?
   A: Well, the best office in the place is the one that Don
{Fites} already is in. I don't care where I'm at. I really
don't. My wife thinks this is a terribly poorly decorated
office, and it is.
                                                                                                       

   Q: What doesn't your wife like about it?
   A: She doesn't think things go together very well. I don't
care about any of that kind of stuff. I'm different, I guess.

   Kemp Says House-Building Proposals
   In Bill Could Institutionalize Profiteering

   WASHINGTON -- Housing Secretary Jack Kemp said that new
housing-construction proposals in legislation that the Senate
will consider today could lead to "institutionalizing
profiteering and political influence peddling."
   Secretary Kemp stopped short of threatening to recommend a
veto of the National Affordable Housing Act, but did say the
Housing and Urban Development Department has "major problems
with this bill as drafted on both policy and budget grounds."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At $17.7 billion for fiscal 1991, the price tag for the
bill is $4 billion more than the administration is willing to
authorize. The act would overhaul federal housing programs.
   The bill would create a new Housing Opportunity
Partnership, or HOP, which would expand housing for the poor
through rehabilitation and new construction using government
and private-sector funding. The legislation also includes
administration proposals to help low-income persons buy their
own homes, including units currently in the public housing
stock.
   Ten HUD programs, including urban homesteading, rental
rehabilitation and public housing construction, would be
consolidated into HOP, which is "designed to be one flexible
delivery system carrying out many of the purposes of older,
more narrowly focussed programs," according to a report by
the Senate's housing and urban affairs subcommittee.
   In a letter to subcommittee Chairman Alan Cranston (D.,
Calif.), Mr. Kemp said federally financed new
housing-construction measures "will run into troublesome
systemic scandals, inadequate targeting to the poor and
management crises." The secretary has made similar criticisms
about legislation approved by a House committee this past
week. Final action on the Senate's measure is expected this
week.
   The Cranston subcommittee report said that "a blanket
position against new production is too simplistic to be a
responsible national housing policy."
   HUD scandals involving political favoritism, influence
peddling and corruption didn't result from new housing
construction efforts, according to the report. "On the
contrary, individuals implicated in the scandals were among
the most vocal opponents of federal assistance for housing
construction," the report said. It said that already-passed
legislation eliminates certain conditions that led to the
scandal and that the proposed legislation provides for
additional protections.
   Mr. Kemp said he favors using the community development
block grant program to provide rental and home-ownership
assistance to low-income families and to assist state and
local governments in the rehabilitation of the existing
housing stock.
   He added that "private-sector construction can offer
dramatic new additions to affordable housing" if only state
and local governments eliminated such barriers as rent
controls, exclusionary zoning, high user fees, and
unnecessary environmental and land-use regulations."
   "These government imposed barriers can add tens of
thousands of dollars to the cost of affordable housing,
pricing moderate and low-income people out of the
marketplace," he wrote.
   The housing bill, which is being considered by the full
Senate earlier than expected, doesn't include Federal Housing
Administration restructuring plans that Mr. Kemp recently
proposed. Those proposals are designed to keep FHA's largest
fund, which insures mortgages with low down payments, from
going broke by the end of the decade.

   SAN DIEGO -- Wahlco Environmental Systems Inc. canceled
plans for a $50 million offering of convertible subordinated
debentures and said delays in orders for its core product
could reduce 1990 earnings by about 10 cents a share from
previous expectations.
   The maker of air-pollution control systems for utilities
said it withdrew the offering because of its eroding stock
price, which has fallen from a record $16.625 late last
month. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Wahlco dropped $2.75 a share to $10.375.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company didn't disclose what its previous earnings
expectations were, but it said it is comfortable with
analysts' current expectations of 70 to 75 cents a share for
the year. Last year, Wahlco had net income of $10.4 million
on revenue of $40.6 million. The company, which has about
17.6 million shares outstanding, didn't report per-share
results for last year because it didn't go public until
April.
   Wahlco blamed the drop in anticipated earnings on delays
in several orders for its flue gas conditioning systems. Of
particular significance, analysts said, was the delay of a $6
million order by a U.K. concern. Wahlco said it hasn't
received contract cancellations from its customers.
   Wahlco said it believes clients are delaying their orders
until the Clean Air Act is completed by Congress, probably
later this year, and that the earnings lost this year "should
be realized" in 1991.

   Surviving Mid-Life Crisis in Japan

<LP>
   TOKYO -- Trade barriers notwithstanding, 80 of the 100
largest foreign-affiliated companies (FACs) entered Japan
before 1975. Today these companies are confronted with a
serious form of mid-life crisis: They have to reinvigorate,
even reinvent, themselves because the sources of their early
advantage are much harder to find and to sustain.
   FACs represent a considerable body of economic activity in
Japan. In 1987, foreign industrial presence here, most of it
U.S.-related, amounted to roughly $300 billion, or about 13%
of Japan's GNP. Of the approximately 450,000 people employed
by FACs in Japan, some three-quarters work for U.S.
companies. This activity is also fairly concentrated. Four
industries -- oil, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and medical
and office equipment -- account for some 60% of sales, and in
each, FACs have achieved industry penetration greater than
10%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   More than 60 of the top 100 FACs established and
consolidated their initial positions on a foundation of
clear-cut technological advantage. But the remaining 40 got
in a different way. Most established themselves by bringing a
completely new product or business concept to Japan.
   With fast-foods, the key was to transfer a product or
service concept from elsewhere -- usually the U.S. -- to
Japan before the local market had begun (e.g., McDonald's,
Nestle, Kentucky Fried Chicken), and to create a strong and
defensible position before local competitors could react.
Coca-Cola seized an opportunity by end-running the
established distribution system and rapidly signing up
top-quality bottlers. It then spent five years training the
bottlers, despite their strong opposition, in Coca-Cola's
route sales approach.
   In these cases, the company introduced a concept new to
Japan and modified it to meet local market needs. This
appears obvious. Not so. How many companies would invest in
building a hamburger chain when all the available market
research says that no one in the target market eats
hamburgers? It's easy to say, with the shoe salesman of
legend, that a new country is a rotten prospect: "No market;
no one wears shoes." It is far harder to say: "Great market;
no one wears shoes" -- and to back it up with the necessary
dollars, people, time and imagination.
   However, even those FACs that started out well and found
effective routes into Japan often have met a crisis as the
initial window of advantage closes. Fuji-Xerox, for example,
showed extraordinary returns until the mid-1970s, when it
came under pressure from emerging Japanese competitors that
were able to capitalize on small copiers and out market them.
Similarly, Procter &amp; Gamble created the disposable-diapers
market in Japan, but its share of almost 100% in 1979 tumbled
to less than 10% as Uni-charm and Kao first met and then
surpassed it on technology, and outmaneuvered it in
distribution-channel management (wholesalers, distributors
and retailers, etc.).
   A senior Japanese executive of a U.S. chemicals company,
now in his 50s, recalls: "Twenty years ago I spent every
night at the best restaurants in Tokyo being entertained by
the chief executives of major Japanese companies, who wanted
to gain access to our technology through joint venture or
licensing. . . . Today, Mitsubishi Chemical has technology to
equal ours; Sumitomo Chemical has surpassed us in some
aspects. No one asks me out to dinner any more."
   For those FACs that do not disappear off the map, this
plunge into a mid-life crisis usually precipitates a major
internal review. The conclusion, quite predictable, is that
"we need to become more of an insider." Since it is difficult
to attract top-level Japanese managers from outside the
company, internal Japanese managers are moved up rapidly.
   While this solution may result in temporary improvements,
management at headquarters outside Japan usually has
difficulty understanding or accepting local Japanese managers
in the top slots. The result is often a swing back toward
"foreign" management -- most visibly, by the outright removal
of the FAC's top managers or by shunting them sideways.
   The ability to manufacture, market and/or sell in Japan
depends, in large measure, on the training and development of
personnel. Few FACs manage to recruit staffers of the quality
of those that enter their Japanese competitors. Effective
execution and the harnessing of global resources also depend
on the transplanting of resources to Japan, despite the high
costs of doing so. Nearly all the industrial companies among
the top 100 FACs have, for example, now established R&amp;D
laboratories in Japan.
   The demands of doing business successfully in Japan,
however, go beyond hiring practices and the transplantation
of R&amp;D laboratories and even factories. As the head of one
FAC put it: "We take the most crucial and complex decisions
about Japan and give them to a group whose knowledge about
doing business here amounts to an annual visit to the Okura
Hotel."
   Thus, the pressure is on to move in the direction in which
IBM moved in the early 1980s when it shifted a full set of
headquarters functions for the Asia-Pacific region to Tokyo.
Johnson &amp; Johnson asked a retiring member of its Executive
Committee, Frank de Angeli, to head the area and based him in
Japan. Others have taken their former Japan "heads" and put
them in charge of the whole Asia-Pacific region (still based
in Japan) with a new Japan head below them.
   These changes highlight what is becoming a core challenge
for FACs and their parents: To compete effectively in Japan
means changing the organization both outside and inside
Japan. As my McKinsey colleague Ken Ohmae has long argued,
success in a global competitive environment requires
companies to "decompose" their global headquarters. There is
often great resistance in doing so. Why, managers wonder,
change comfortable arrangements many thousand miles away when
the problems are local in Japan?
   How FACs resolve the problems accompanying their mid-life
crisis will do much to shape the Japanese economy of the 21st
century as well as Japan's economic relationships with the
rest of the world. Traditional sources of advantage no longer
work, and making the necessary adjustments requires carrying
out substantial changes not just in operations in Japan, but
also at headquarters.

   JERUSALEM -- Pushed by rapidly rising housing prices,
Israel's consumer price index rose 1.6% in May, the
government announced.
   The rise in the index, which measures price changes in a
fixed market basket of goods and services, compares with 2.5%
in April and 0.9% in May 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government-run Central Bureau of Statistics projected
that inflation for the year would probably be about 18%, or
little changed from the three preceding years.
   The bureau attributed May's increase to price rises for
fruit and vegetables, clothing, footware and housing. The
housing component climbed 2.2% during the month, the bureau
said.
   Housing costs have been pushed up by a shortage caused by
an influx of Soviet Jews to Israel, expected to reach up to
150,000 this year.

   FLINT, Mich. -- Action Auto Stores Inc. said it has
voluntarily filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code "in order to continue the
company's restructuring and consolidation program."
   C. James Sabo, chairman and chief executive officer of the
auto-parts retailer, said: "We regret having to take this
action, but we believe that it was absolutely necessary for
the overall well-being of the company."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chapter 11 protects a company from creditor lawsuits while
it works out a plan to repay debt. A spokesman said the
company filed under Chapter 11 after taking an "assessment of
our financial situation." He declined to be more specific.
   In reaction to recent quarterly losses, Action Auto in
March said it started a cost-cutting program, obtained a $9
million secured line of credit from its bank and modified its
agreement with another lender.
   Mr. Sabo said that the Chapter 11 filing shouldn't affect
the efforts under way by the investment banking firm of
PaineWebber Inc. to restructure the company.

   CUYAHOGA HEIGHTS, Ohio -- American Steel &amp; Wire Corp.
declared a special dividend of $3.25 a share after completion
of a $95 million borrowing.
   The dividend, the steel producer's first since it went
public in 1988, is payable June 29 to stock of record June
24.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said the dividend will consume about $27
million of the borrowed funds. Slightly more than that will
be used to refinance debt, the company said, with the
remainder available for capital expenditures, working capital
and other corporate purposes.
   In late April, American Steel said it might pay a dividend
of as much as $4.25 a share when the financing was completed.
However, sales have been picking up, making it advisable to
retain more of the borrowed funds for improving facilities
and working capital, said C.V. Meserole III, executive vice
president and chief financial officer.
   Directors decided to use borrowed funds to pay a special
dividend to shareholders, who haven't fared as well in the
stock market as they might have expected when they bought the
stock at $9 a share in the 1988 initial offering, Mr.
Meserole said. The stock closed Friday at $6.25, up 25 cents,
in over-the-counter trading.
   The lending institutions include Security Pacific Business
Credit Inc., Sanwa Business Credit Corp., State Bank of South
Australia and Cigna Investments Inc., American Steel said.

   Russia Hasn't Yet Tamed the Golden Hordes

   Outbreaks of violence in Central Asia are being attributed
by Soviet authorities to "inter-ethnic" conflicts, mainly
between Uzbek and Kirghiz factions. But Moscow has a far
bigger problem than that. Central Asia, populated mainly by
the descendants of Genghis Khan, has never cottoned to
Russian rule. Now it is in a position to do something about
it.
   Shukrulla Rahmatovich Mirsaidov, prime minister of the
most populous Central Asian republic, Uzbekistan, recently
issued a "declaration of economic independence." He is
demanding greater control over the republic's resources.
Uzbekistan already is conducting some foreign and domestic
trade independently of Moscow's directives. The Soviet
Parliament, desperately trying to stave off economic
collapse, may have added impetus to such ad-hoc
decentralization moves last week by pushing for devolution of
central-government property to regional and local authorities
to promote market economics.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A housing shortage was the flash point of Central Asian
unrest. Rapid growth of the population has been aggravated by
an influx of refugees from other trouble spots, such as
Armenia and Azerbaijan. There are well-founded suspicions
that the KGB stirred up some of the ethnic quarrels over
housing to provide an excuse for the military crackdown
unleashed on the region by Moscow early this month.
   The most serious "inter-ethnic" conflict is between the
Central Asian peoples as a group and the Russians. It has
existed for centuries. Ivan the Terrible, reacting against
many years of devastating assaults on Russia by the Mongols
and Tartars, conquered the Khanate of Kazan in 1552, giving
Russia its first Moslem subjects. The Russians completed
their conquest of the region in 1873.
   But this part of the Russian empire, as with others, has
been held together mainly with force and cunning, not by
mutual advantage of the type that has made other empires
thrive. Some of the more idealistic Bolsheviks of the Lenin
era hoped to create a genuine "union" of peoples of disparate
cultures. But just as communism ultimately failed as an
economic idea it also failed as an instrument for creating
social and cultural comity.
   Central Asians helped the Bolsheviks overthrow Czar
Nicholas II. The Uzbeks had visions of shucking off the czars
and setting up a European-style democracy, as might befit a
country nearly as large as Spain. But all those early dreams
were wiped out by Stalinist tyranny. Islam was brutally
suppressed. Secret-police methods of political control were
installed, and the Central Asians were no better off than
they had been under the czars.
   During World War II, Stalin moved factories to Uzbekistan
to get them out of the reach of the Germans. The Russians
also have developed Uzbekistan's natural resources -- gas,
oil, a variety of metal ores, uranium and the gold of the
Kyzyl Kum desert. But the region still is heavily
agricultural. One of the many Uzbek grievances is over their
share of the fruits of their natural wealth. Pipelines
carrying Uzbek gas to Russia pass through regions that have
no access to fuel, they complain.
   One of the biggest failures, however, has been the
self-conscious Russian attempt at cultural imperialism. No
one would doubt the richness of Russian culture, but Central
Asia has its own cultural history. Indeed, it was a thriving
outpost of Persian civilization at the time of Alexander the
Great's conquests in the fourth century B.C., when Russia was
a vast wilderness. The emperor Tamerlane, sitting in his
wealthy capital of Samarkand, ruled a 14th-century empire
that stretched from Baghdad to Delhi.
   I had a firsthand glimpse of the Russian-Uzbek cultural
division in 1967 when I toured Tashkent, Samarkand and
Bukhara -- three ancient Uzbek cities -- for an article in
this newspaper about Soviet tourism. The Soviets had just
opened up Central Asia to tourists. I asked the Intourist
bureau at the Tashkent Hotel for a ticket to a concert that
would give me a taste of the local culture. What I got
instead was a ticket to a viola concert by a Russian woman.
It was almost a private performance because the vast hall was
nearly empty. Russian culture was not a big draw in Tashkent.
   A few nights later, I made the same request in Bukhara, an
ancient city that still had at its center the large domed
caravansary that once was an overnight haven for the richly
laden camel caravans traveling the silk route between the
Middle East and China. This time, the Intourist desk was
manned by Uzbeks and a young Uzbek guide conducted me to a
concert very much to her own liking, seating me in the front
row with a jolly group that seemed to be members of her
extended family. This time the performer was an Uzbek man
plucking a stringed instrument and keening the haunting,
unrhythmic music of the Turkic world.
   "He is a classic," my guide whispered, and a packed house
seemed to agree, applauding each song wildly. The guide's
kinfolk, pleased at having a visitor from a distant planet,
treated me to a glass of Pepsi.
   In Samarkand, another guide showed me the observatory
where Ulugh Beg, the great Uzbek astronomer, in the 15th
century had made precise calculations of the distance to the
sun. Nearby, gleaming in the spectacular light that followed
a thundershower, were the beautiful turquoise domes of
mosques that still decorate Tamerlane's capital. At that time
their use for worship was being discouraged by the Russians.
Indeed, the grand mosque at Bukhara, with columns made of
wood from the Holy Land, had been converted to a billiard
parlor by Soviet authorities.
   On a still-seamier note, I had been greeted in Tashkent
when I deplaned at 2 a.m. after a five-hour flight from
Moscow by a tough-looking fellow who had joined the young man
from Intourist. His purpose was to see that I stopped in the
airport lounge to have a drink with some of his friends, two
men and two women. It soon became obvious that these were my
local KGB shadows, folks I kept glimpsing out of the corner
of my eye throughout my innocent pursuit of the tourism
story.
   Today's unrest is the legacy of economic exploitation, KGB
fun and games, and attempts to suppress Islam (which have
proved unsuccessful). It comes as no surprise today that
local politicians in Tashkent and elsewhere in Central Asia
have been emboldened by "glasnost" to begin to talk about
Uzbek independence and about keeping some of the wealth of
their country for the direct benefit of the people there. As
with the Baltic peoples, they complain about having their
young men drafted to serve in the Soviet army. Those soldiers
proved highly unreliable when they were sent into Afghanistan
early in the war there, so much so that they were quickly
withdrawn. The Afghan rebels looked more like brothers than
did the Russians.
   None of this says much about the future of Central Asia,
particularly now that Soviet troops are on the scene. But it
is useful to remember that it does have a culture, and a
polity, of its own. And after all these years, the Russians
are discovering that their brand of imperialism has not been
a big success.

   TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. said
exports declined significantly in May from a year earlier,
although domestic sales and production rose.
   Officials of both companies attributed the continued drop
in exports to efforts to shift production overseas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Exports by Toyota, Japan's largest auto manufacturer, fell
3.6% in May to 147,377 units, the second consecutive monthly
decline. A company official cited a downward trend in exports
to North America.
   Toyota exports to the U.S. and Canada in May fell 11.6% to
68,319 units from a year earlier. Conversely, exports to the
Middle East rose 9.4% to 9,625 units, reflecting the region's
improving economy. Passenger car exports to the Middle East
jumped 12.5%, while exports to Europe rose 5.5%.
   Nissan, Japan's second largest car maker, reported similar
results. It said exports in May fell for the ninth
consecutive month, declining 6% to 79,049 units.
   Exports to Southeast Asia tumbled 29.7% to 6,399 units, a
Nissan official said, while exports to Europe fell 16.5% to
32,592 units.
   Nissan's exports to the U.S. climbed 15% to 25,333 units,
but the company official said the rise was exaggerated. "The
volume remains consistent but the basis of comparison was
particularly low," she said.
   Toyota's domestic sales rose 8.4% from last May to
194,203, marking the 14th consecutive monthly increase. It
said the total represented a new high for the month, topping
the previous record of 179,165 units set in 1989.
   Total domestic market share held by Toyota slipped one
percentage point to 32%.
   Sales of Toyota's passenger cars rose 5.8% to 144,479
units, while sales of trucks and buses rose 16.6% to 49,724
units.
   Nissan's domestic sales grew 5.6% in May to 103,424,
putting its domestic market share for May at 23.3%, down 0.1
percentage point from May 1989.
   Nissan's sales of passenger cars rose 4.2% to 77,145
units, a record for the month. Truck and bus sales rose 9.9%
to 26,279 units.
   Toyota's overall production rose 9.1% to 357,503 units
last month, a record for the month of May. Overseas
production soared 58.7% to to 60,447 units. A breakdown of
output showed an 11.7% increase in passenger cars, to
284,173, while trucks and buses slipped 0.1% to 73,330 units.
   Nissan's overall production rose 6.5% to 252,173 units
last month, with domestic output rising 10.7% to 196,666
units.
   Overseas production by Nissan fell from a year earlier for
the second consecutive month, an indication that Nissan Motor
Manufacturing Corp. (U.S.) and Nissan Motor Manufacturing
(U.K.) Ltd. are set to release new models, the company said.
   Nissan produced 161,162 passenger cars in May, up 10.6%,
and 35,504 trucks and buses, up 11.3%.

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
RECREATION, ENTERTAINMENT, TOYS, MOVIES, PHOTOGRAPHY, SPORTS (REC)
</IN>
<LP>
   WAUKEGAN, Ill. -- Outboard Marine Corp. isn't positioning
itself for "tomorrow or the next quarter, but for the long
term" during the current slump in the recreational boating
industry, James C. Chapman, president and chief executive
officer, said.
   Outboard Marine is sticking with its program of vertical
integration of engine and boat manufacturing and stepping up
its global sales and marketing efforts, Mr. Chapman said in
an interview.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Initially a leading manufacturer of boat engines, Outboard
Marine will step up its presence in all aspects of boat and
engine sales and manufacturing to "compete in every product
line," according to Mr. Chapman. He said Outboard Marine also
will work to rebuild its relationship with its 5,000 North
American dealers, many of whom are wary of expanding
inventory as consumers shun recreational boats.
   In its second quarter, ended March 31, Outboard Marine had
a loss of $5.6 million, or 29 cents a share, from continuing
operations. It had profit of $9.2 million, or 47 cents a
share, in the year-earlier period. Sales in the quarter fell
to $309.2 million from $402.6 million.
   While expanding its interests from engine manufacturing to
boating packaging and sales, Outboard Marine has shed its
unrelated units. After selling its Cushman industrial vehicle
and turf-care business to Ransomes America Corp. for $150
million and its Lawn-Boy lawn mower division to Toro Co. for
$85 million, Outboard Marine is in a strong cash position
with a debt-to-equity ratio of about 26%. A flurry of
acquisitions has added the Donzi and Chris-Craft boat and
cruiser lines to Outboard Marine's industry-leading Johnson
and Evinrude outboard brands.
   Mr. Chapman said Outboard Marine's recent acquisition of
Grumman Corp.'s boat division brought it 11 boat makers with
13 brand names. He said the purchase has allowed Outboard
Marine to push hard to boost its position in the world
market.
   In the 3 1/2 years that it has been selling packaged
boats, Outboard Marine brands accounted for 25% of all U.S.
boats sold overseas, Mr. Chapman said. International sales
accounted for 23% of the company's $1.46 billion revenue in
1989, and its goal is to boost overseas sales to as much as
35% of the total.
   Mr. Chapman said Outboard Marine will continue to hold
down manufacturing costs in the capital-intensive engine
manufacturing business. From 1980 to 1985, the firm spent
$100 million to move 70% of its manufacturing capacity from
Northern plants to technically improved sites in the South,
Mr. Chapman said. Those moves resulted in a 50% reduction in
labor costs, he said.
   Outboard Marine has responded to the 15% industrywide
sales downturn over the past 18 months by closing one plant
and idling workers at others. The closing last month of an
engine assembly plant in Rutherfordton, N.C., will result in
a $3 million charge for the current quarter.
   "It may seem contradictory to close an assembly plant and
buy a boat company," Mr. Chapman said. "But the closings help
us consolidate our outboard manufacturing in the here and
now. The acquisitions are for our long-term strength. The
next 100 years, that's what we're looking at."

   Sentencing Set for Today for Three Men
   Involved in Scheme to Falsify Test Results

   LOS ANGELES -- Federal prosecutors are seeking "a
substantial period of incarceration" for the president of a
now-defunct company that pleaded guilty in April to
falsifying test results on millions of nuts and bolts that
are supposed to hold together aircraft engines.
   The government's attempt to jail the executive, McHaffie
Inc.'s Norman McHaffie, is likely to be bolstered by a diary
account of the scheme kept by another defendant in the case.
Sentencing is set for today.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the hand-written journal, McHaffie quality-control
supervisor James Hicks detailed the extraordinary lengths to
which he, Mr. McHaffie and a third defendant, shop-floor
manager William Whitham, went to keep the skullduggery a
secret. All three men have admitted wrongdoing.
   The scam, the government says, took place over a 10-year
period beginning in 1979 and involved more than 4,000
government and commercial contracts. According to documents
filed in U.S. District Court here, the employees of Sylmar,
Calif.-based McHaffie decided not to conduct
Pentagon-mandated testing on their products, but rather
filled out blank, certified reports as if they had passed.
   The court papers also assert that certain bolts sent to
General Electric Co.'s engine-making division had actually
failed testing performed by an outside laboratory. But the
words "does not" were whited-out of the lab reports, which
were then photocopied, so that only "meet specification
requirements" remained.
   Eventually, the government says, Messrs. Hicks and
Whitham, with Mr. McHaffie's "knowledge and approval,
performed the dirty work of removing a large quantity of the
fraudulently created test documents from" the company's files
and threw them in a trash dumpster.
   Stephen Mansfield, the assistant U.S. attorney handling
the case, said no engine failures have been attributed to a
McHaffie part. But he painted the company's conduct as a
clear threat to safety. Among the planes using McHaffie
fasteners are the B-1 bomber, the A-7 attack plane and the
F-18, F-16 and F-14 fighters.
   In addition, thousands of Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas
Corp. commercial jets were outfitted with GE engines during
the time of the illicit conduct. GE, while maintaining there
was no danger, ultimately scrapped all the McHaffie equipment
it had in stock.
   The McHaffie case is part of a larger effort by the
Justice Department to crack down on companies that peddle
substandard or poorly tested aircraft components. Just a few
weeks ago, for instance, a unit of Banner Industries Inc.'s
Fairchild subsidiary agreed to plead guilty and pay $18
million in fines and penalties to settle civil and criminal
charges stemming from fraudulent testing documents it
submitted on its aerospace fasteners.
   "It's clear that ferreting out quality fraud is a top
priority for the department," said Bruce Carter, an assistant
U.S. attorney in Seattle who is leading a special task force
focusing on such crimes.
   In the McHaffie case, the company faces a maximum fine of
$1.5 million, which the government is seeking. The
prosecution is also pushing for Mr. McHaffie to cough up
$750,000, the maximum, and he could land in prison for as
many as 15 years as well. Messrs. Hicks and Whitham, whom the
government says cooperated with the investigation once they
became fearful of being implicated, could be sentenced to up
to 10 years in prison and $500,000 fines.
   Lawyers for Messrs. McHaffie and Hicks declined comment.
Mr. Whitham's counsel couldn't be reached.
   The government said it anticipates that Mr. McHaffie may
try to blame the fraud on "renegade employees." But, it said,
that stance conflicts with his sworn plea and the evidence at
hand.
   In fact, Mr. Hicks may have begun to keep his diary of
deceit after becoming worried that Mr. McHaffie would try to
pin the whole affair on him. At one point, he chronicled
efforts by a GE official, John Frassica, to get to the bottom
of what was happening.
   "John Frassica called and said he could not figure out why
their test failed and ours passed," Mr. Hicks wrote in a
March 28, 1989, entry.
   Then on March 31: "He called twice wanting answers. I told
Norm {Mr. McHaffie} there was no way to explain."
   April 4: "Norm's idea was for me to take the blame for
everything to protect the rest. I agreed and he said that if
I took the blame he would set up another business if
necessary and continue to pay me as normal. Everyone in the
meeting agreed with the plan. Norm committed that he would
see that all of us would be taken care of and shook hands."
   In a filing last week, the government contended that
McHaffie, which shut down operations in June 1989 and
eventually sold off its assets, saved more than $1.5 million
by its actions. The government also contended that Mr.
McHaffie's "10-year fraud . . . has enabled him to live a
comfortable life," citing his ownership of a $250,000-plus
yacht and several condominiums in Mexico.
   In one of his last diary entries on June 2, Mr. Hicks
wrote: "The people in the plant are very nervous about their
jobs. I'm doing the best I can to answer questions, but I
don't know much about what's going on. All Norm has said is
it's every man for himself."
   Mr. Hicks then penned two final words: "Nice guy."

Philadelphia general obligation bonds to Triple-B-minus from
Triple-B-plus. The rating agency cited the city's inability
to erase its deficit, which is expected to reach $60 million
for the year ending June 30. It would be the city's third
consecutive deficit and next fiscal year's budget also has a
likelihood of an imbalance, S&amp;P said. Other issues downgraded
to Triple-B-minus from Triple-B-plus include $9 million
issued by the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority, $6
million issued by the Philadelphia Parking Authority, and
$7.6 million issued by the Philadelphia Parking Authority. A
final rating is still pending on the March 1990 offering of
$148 million of variable rate general obligations, backed by
a letter of credit by Fuji Bank. S&amp;P said Philadelphia's
financial outlook for fiscal 1991 is not expected to improve.
A recent court stipulation will require the city to provide
an additional $32 million for child welfare. The city also
may be required by court order to refund an additional $25
million in real estate transfer tax collections that were
declared illegal a year ago. S&amp;P also anticipates the city
having to pay $20 million in labor arbitration settlements
and an indeterminate amount in court costs.

   RELIANCE GROUP HOLDINGS Inc. (New York) -- Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said it raised its ratings on this insurance and
financial holding company's senior debt to double-B from
single-B-plus and on subordinated debt to single-B-plus from
single-B-minus. The rating concern affirmed its ratings on
debt of related entities, including Reliance Group Inc.,
Reliance Financial Services Corp., and Reliance Insurance Co.
About $1.2 billion in debt was affected. S&amp;P noted that
Reliance Group Holdings continues to show improved financial
leverage, augmented by a large capital gain from the sale of
an insurance unit in April, and that it expects the trend of
improved financial leverage to continue. But S&amp;P lowered to
triple-B-plus from single-A its rating on the claims-paying
ability of United Pacific Life Insurance Co., which S&amp;P said
has a "significant tolerance for single-issue concentrations
in its large high-yield portfolio."

   Midland Chief Can't Seem to Halt Slide

   Rising Costs, Falling
   Earnings Imperil Merger

   LONDON -- When Sir Kit McMahon took the helm at Midland
Bank PLC three years ago, his mission was to straighten out
Britain's most troubled major financial institution. It
increasingly looks like a mission impossible.
   Midland, Britain's third-largest bank, seems to be
slipping backward rather than turning around. Costs are
rising, earnings are declining and finding new business is
growing harder in a saturated market. The situation raises
questions about Midland's future and clouds prospects for its
long-expected combination with Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though Sir Kit has shaken some of tradition-bound
Midland's complacency, he and his team haven't rectified
Midland's core problems: a fatter cost base, a worsening
bad-debt portfolio and poorer-yielding assets than its major
U.K. competitors. After bad-debt write-offs, Midland has
spent two of the past three years in the red, and probably
would face another if it could afford to raise reserves for
soured international loans to competitors' levels. With the
economic climate worsening at home, Sir Kit has been warning
that earnings are running below last year's slackened pace.
If the trend continues, and many analysts say it will, Sir
Kit's management will have produced lower operating earnings
for two consecutive years -- half the time he's been in
command. (Midland releases first-half results Aug. 2.)
   "There's disappointment" among investors with Midland's
lack of progress, says Gary Mairs, analyst and fund manager
at Scottish Amicable Investment Managers in Glasgow, a
Midland institutional holder. Sir Kit's team hasn't "achieved
what the market was expecting." Salomon Brothers analyst
Stephen Lewis, son of a Midland banker and a former employee
himself, says Midland "is in the weakest position" of
Britain's major banks. "They really haven't got the financial
resources" to compete in the longer term.
   Against that backdrop, bankers and customers in London and
Hong Kong are asking whether the transaction that was
expected to resolve Midland's capital problems and transform
its future -- a merger with or friendly acquisition by larger
Hongkong Bank -- will occur this year or next, if at all.
Such a combination would create the world's ninth-largest
bank; its nearly $240 billion in assets would make it
slightly bigger than Citicorp.
   Merger talks began in late 1987 when Hongkong Bank
acquired a 14.9% Midland stake. Those discussions had been
expected to produce closer links by this December, when
Hongkong Bank is freed from an accord freezing its stake. But
Midland's recent problems, coupled with smaller-scale
uncertainties at Hongkong Bank, have raised doubts that the
move will happen so quickly.
   In an interview, Sir Kit says "tactical" problems have
cropped up at both banks, but he adds the merger strategy
remains unchanged. Hongkong Bank Deputy Chairman John Gray
echoes the view. "The concern that has been expressed by Sir
Kit {about Midland's current profit outlook} we would have to
share," says Mr. Gray. But "the relationship is going pretty
well." He points to several hundred million pounds in
referred business shared by the banks and to the successful
swap of certain Midland Far Eastern assets for Hongkong Bank
European branches. "Conceptually {a combination} has to make
sense," says Mr. Gray. Neither he nor Sir Kit will talk about
a timetable.
   However, Midland's darkening outlook weakens Sir Kit's
bargaining power on jobs, management power and price. Even if
the banks do combine, they still will face deep problems.
   Sir Kit, a former central banker and academic, brought a
new style to Midland, but acknowledges he has found the going
tougher than expected. "Certainly a lot of people expected it
to produce change quicker than it has, and maybe we incited
their expectations too much," says Sir Kit. "In many ways we
set out explicitly to change the culture." That, he adds, "is
a hazardous and difficult thing to do, which leads to
accidents as well as successes."
   Though Britain's inflation-infested economy is hurting
many banks, Midland suffers from a combination of troubles
all its own. Just 45 years ago, Midland was the world's
biggest bank. But its failure to modernize and diversify from
its base in Britain's rusting industrial heartland caused the
bank to slide several dozen places. When Midland finally
expanded overseas, it moved recklessly and accumulated
billions of dollars in losses from Third World debt and its
Crocker Bank acquisition in the U.S.
   Sir Kit has shuffled a dozen senior managers and
directors, but the team still looks like the gang that
couldn't shoot straight. Though Sir Kit came in wielding a
cost-cutter's knife, Midland's operating costs have risen
steadily. Cutting salaries and closing branches has proven
difficult; indeed, staff compensation rose 11% last year to
#1.19 billion ($2.03 billion). As a result, Midland has
failed to lower its cost-to-income ratio, which rose slightly
last year to 72.4%, the highest among major British banks and
well above U.S. averages.
   Part of the cost growth is due to back-office investment.
H. Eugene Lockhart, an abrasive former consultant now in
charge of Midland's U.K. banking, says 13 regional
"processing factories" are handling more of Midland's
clearing business and are already saving money. But he says
significant improvement in cost ratios depends less on
cutting costs than drumming up new business.
   To do that, Midland has embarked on an ambitious and
costly strategy to market its products as brands, like candy
or cigarettes. But it's still far from clear how much
customers appreciate the effort. The most unconventional
campaign is a series of surreal advertisements for a
telephone-banking service, called First Direct, which has
British tongues wagging -- some with ridicule. Sir Kit says
the ads have grabbed attention, and he cites a high product
awareness among target consumers.
   Less pleasing was Midland's #116 million loss in a
money-market division last year. Senior asset managers
incorrectly anticipated a fall in U.K. interest rates; when
those rates rose, Midland took a big hit on its money-market
positions. Midland expects a similar-scale loss this year as
the position unwinds.
   Richard Delbridge, who became finance director in the
aftermath of the loss, says the loss "could happen to any
bank," but adds "we wouldn't take that size position again."
In an unrelated -- but some say analogous -- management
mix-up earlier in Sir Kit's tenure, Midland staged an
embarrassing flip-flop in its accounting practices related to
bad-debt write-offs.
   The search for an explanation for such blunders often
comes back to Sir Kit. Though peers give the 62-year-old
Australian high marks for intellect and charm, he is
sometimes aloof and is considered to give subordinates too
much freedom.
   Counters Sir Kit: "If you don't let people do what they
can, you don't get the best out of them. But then they
sometimes make mistakes." He says Midland, which continues to
spend heavily on new technology and marketing, is on track to
emerge leaner and more profitable. "By five years from now
there will be quite a change."

   Amex-CBOE Alliance Heats After-Hours Trading Battle

   NEW YORK -- The exchanges' battle for positions in the
budding after-hours stock trading market is heating up.
   Today, the American Stock Exchange, Chicago Board Options
Exchange, Cincinnati Stock Exchange and Reuters Holdings PLC
of Britain are expected to announce a major nighttime trading
effort. The strategic alliance between the U.S. exchanges and
Reuters is a direct response to the New York Stock Exchange's
recently announced after-hours trading proposals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The alliance will mark an unprecedented partnership
between two big options exchanges, the Amex and CBOE; the
latter is the world's largest options exchange. The
consortium also will expand Reuters' already powerful
foothold in electronic trading systems.
   The plan also could revive interest in the lackluster
Cincinnati Stock Exchange, which trades about 500 Big Board
issues electronically but in relatively light volume.
   The new after-hours trading system, to be announced at a
news conference in Chicago and New York this morning, is
primarily designed for options trading, according to people
familiar with the still-incomplete negotiations. The network
is to be built by Reuters and isn't expected to be in
operation until next year at the earliest.
   The new Amex-CBOE network could accommodate after-hours
trading in most Big Board issues in the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index. It wasn't clear whether the system will run
all night, but it would be capable of doing that. The system
could match orders for stocks and options, such as the
Instinet electronic trading network, a Reuters subsidiary,
and provide market making through traders who already deal on
the three exchanges.
   Officials of the Amex and CBOE, the main partners in the
new options network, wouldn't comment prior to today's news
conference. A Reuters spokesman declined to discuss details
of the project.
   The partnership between the Amex and CBOE comes at a
moment of increased competition for both exchanges --
possibly with each other. Under a mandate from the Securities
and Exchange Commission, options listed for trading after
Jan. 22, 1991, may be traded on more than one exchange. And
the SEC requested that by June 30, exchanges come up with a
system to link their markets, so investors can have access to
the best price. A person familiar with the alliance between
the exchanges said the after-hours system could serve as a
partial response to SEC demands. On Jan. 21, all exclusive
options-trading privileges will be eliminated.
   Options give a holder the right, but not the obligation,
to trade a security at a predetermined price within a set
period.
   The new options network completes other efforts toward
after-hours trading of securities by U.S. exchanges. Besides
the plan for periodic night trading of stocks at the Big
Board in New York, the Globex system for after-hours trading
in currency and interest rate futures is under development by
two Chicago exchanges and Reuters. The big S&amp;P 500
stock-index futures contract could be put on Globex, once the
system is up and running, executives of the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange said. Trading on Globex is expected to
begin as early as November.
   But there is much skepticism about how many investors will
use all these products. Last week, Big Board Chairman John J.
Phelan Jr. indicated that he is still gauging demand for
after-hours trading. A person familiar with the Amex-CBOE
consortium said the customer base has yet to be discovered.
Still, he said, the options exchanges believe they have to be
prepared for after-hours trading, especially because of the
Big Board's move.
   "If night trading on stocks becomes common, it's only
logical we'll have options, too," an exchange official who is
familiar with the plans said.
   Despite the questions about customer demand, the new stock
and options network represents yet another potential threat
to the New York Stock Exchange, the central stock market for
the biggest U.S. stocks. The Big Board has stepped up its
after-hours trading efforts, to head off erosion of its
traditional trading volume to electronic, regional and
overseas markets.
   "It's going to be a real challenge for the New York Stock
Exchange, but the ultimate alignment {in nighttime trading}
is still in question," a person close to the talks said.
"Everybody is positioning."
   The Amex and CBOE, which account for about 75% of all U.S.
options trading volume, have other products in addition to
stock options that might be attractive to investors, once
after-hours trading in stocks takes off. The Amex lists the
Major Market Index options and the CBOE lists the Standard &amp;
Poor's 100-stock index options, both favorites of program
traders and other large investors looking to hedge their
stock portfolios.
   A person familiar with the Amex-CBOE plan said it wasn't
clear whether the two big option-index products will be
listed on the new electronic system, rather than just options
on individual stocks. But it is possible. Also, just as in
the Big Board's proposed new system, the Amex-CBOE plan has a
different role for the exchanges' market makers on the floor;
these people wouldn't be physically present during the
after-hours electronic trading, but are expected to have some
role and possibly share in the profits.
   Meanwhile, the over-the-counter market is gearing up for
after-hours trading, as well. The National Association of
Securities Dealers' Nasdaq automated quotations trading
system is scheduled to launch an after-hours trading venture
Sept. 1.

   OPTIONS LISTED for trading since Jan. 22, 1990, may be
traded on more than one exchange under a Securities and
Exchange Commission mandate. Yesterday's edition misstated
the year the mandate took effect.

a car phone, holding his pipe instead as he shuttles
contentedly about this metropolis in a Dodge convertible. He
sometimes sounds like he's running to prove a point to the
campaign consultants of America. He emphasizes a distaste for
"packaging." His radio spots were cut from a Steiger
monologue his sons taped in their father's kitchen in
Prescott. No pollster pointed him toward winning issues, and
the ads run randomly without an attempt to target subject
matter to station audience.

   In the jumble of politics in the nation's
second-fastest-growing state (behind only Nevada), maybe it
pays just to let the rhetorical missiles fall where they
will. Arizona is an uneasy mix of cowboys &amp; Indians, retirees
and urban professionals, but the fact that nearly a million
of them found their way here in the 1980s gives it added
national weight. It should gain two congressional districts
from the new Census, and that makes the governorship a bigger
prize. Moreover, Mr. Steiger's beliefs, a modified form of
laissez faire, have special significance here, where the
political drift is toward the bigger government that typifies
populous jurisdictions.
   Long removed from his native Brooklyn, Mr. Steiger appears
comfortable with who he is, where's he been and what he
thinks. That's not as clear a plus as it might seem, because
in standard political terms, he is damaged goods.
   His story began auspiciously enough, with election to the
Arizona Senate in 1960 at age 31. He was a congressman at 37
and recognized as a conservative comer during the Nixon
presidency. After five House terms, however, his bid for the
U.S. Senate in 1976 was entangled in a bitter primary that he
says included anti-Semitism by his opponent; he was defeated
in the fall by Democrat Dennis DeConcini.
   Thus began a decade of setbacks private and public. The
cattle business went sour. In 1982 he ran for governor -- as
the nominee of the Libertarian Party. Mr. Steiger got an
unusually high 5% of the vote then, but the link with what
even he and many other small-L libertarians regard as a
fringe group did not enhance his gravitas. The Purple Heart
winner in Korea was already an oddball in some eyes because
of a brush with the law years before when he shot some feral
burros in the behind. (The incident still comes up.)
   Mr. Steiger re-entered public life as an aide to Evan
Mecham, the right-wing populist elected governor in a
three-way race in 1986. He left his post prior to Mr.
Mecham's impeachment and removal by the Legislature in 1988,
but not before he himself was caught up in the
political/legal storm. He was convicted of extortion for
threatening a parole official's job, but an appellate court,
apparently accepting Mr. Steiger's contention that his
characteristic bluster was distorted by an anti-Mecham
prosecutor, overturned the verdict.
   In his campaign appearances Mr. Steiger jokes about his
hard times. He portrays himself as an "SOB" who can whip a
fractious Legislature into action, and as a man whose own ups
and downs suit him for governing a state that's suffered a
real-estate finance blowout in recent years but, according to
Mr. Steiger, is primed for recovery.
   Mr. Mecham, also trying a comeback as one of Mr. Steiger's
opponents in the Sept. 11 Republican primary, includes his
former aide in his stump vitriol. The pair are among the
three leading GOP contenders. (Fife Symington, a wealthy
developer, is considered the front-runner by some.)
   Mr. Steiger has been less harsh on his former boss, though
he points up management and personal weaknesses. What brought
the two together in 1986 was a shared antipathy for Arizona's
power structure, which these days is a bedfellowship of
statist Democrats and corporatist Republicans. Mr. Steiger
says he wanted to strike at the expanding governmental mass
through streamlinings and privatizations, but Mr. Mecham was
distracted by uproars over his crankiness toward cosmopolitan
culture. With only a limited political base to begin with,
Mr. Mecham couldn't withstand a press frenzy fed by his own
maladroitness. He was later acquitted of criminal charges.
   The Democrat who took his place, longtime Secretary of
State Rose Mofford, generally restored the policies of Mr.
Mecham's predecessor, Bruce Babbitt. Symbolically foremost
among these: a paid holiday to honor Martin Luther King Jr.
After a petition campaign made the first attempt at
reinstituting the King day off subject to a referendum this
November, Ms. Mofford and a media-led coalition got the
legislators this spring to pass a bill to circumvent the
vote. This has led to another active petition drive to get
the issue back on the November ballot. Mr. Mecham's people
are leading the effort. Meanwhile, a referendum drive is
pledged by opponents of a tax increase that may pass in the
legislature today to accommodate rapid growth in state
spending.
   The particular volatility of Arizona politics in 1990 is
an environment the rough-and-tumble Mr. Steiger may find
advantageous. He says, however, that stability is required
because "Arizona is fast earning a national reputation as the
Venice Beach of the world" because of its freakish politics,
and that his free-market pragmatism and common sense are the
antidote.
   Indeed, Mr. Steiger appears to have kept at least a foot
in the establishment's camp. His campaign treasurer is a top
official of the Phoenix 40, a civic group that functions as a
sort of executive council of what might be called the
governing Arizocracy. And he has taken a progressive stance
on some social issues. He backs the King holiday. He urges
more use of "intensive probation" as an alternative to prison
time, which he says breeds more crime. And he favors abortion
rights, admitting he's lost conservative backers as a result
but arguing that a lucrative black market would spring up in
the event of restrictions.
   Although he has discarded the formal affiliation, Mr.
Steiger remains essentially a libertarian. He says economists
Milton Friedman and Murray Rothbard have most influenced him.
When asked, he's prone to say that farmers shouldn't get
subsidized water and other businesses shouldn't be favored
either, except possibly on land-improvement costs. But his
platform comes off as rather moderate. He dodges the
drug-legalization issue. Privatization remains his way of
slimming down the state agencies, 40% of whose employees, he
says, are in management.
   A big issue for Mr. Steiger recently has been the rapid
growth of the state university system. (Arizona State now has
65,000 students; the University of Arizona, 40,000.) He
suggests that many enrollees belong instead in a beefed up
community-college system.
   Mr. Steiger likes to bash the bar. One of his aims is to
have "lawyers leaving Arizona for lack of business, and
business coming for lack of lawyers." He seeks to require
losing plaintiffs to pay civil-court costs of the defense in
order to deter litigiousness. It was reported last week
however, that Mr. Steiger himself hasn't paid a 1984 judgment
and costs from a civil case he initiated.
   Although he lists as qualifications a penchant for
personal deal-making and "a perverse delight in making people
mad," two traits that might be ascribed to Evan Mecham, Mr.
Steiger hastens to draw a contrast. He knows when to cajole,
he says, and would delegate authority, whereas Mr. Mecham
wouldn't. He recalls being in the governor's office during
one of the tense periods when Mr. Mecham, an auto dealer in
private life, was interrupted to approve an advertising
jingle his son, then running the dealership, had conceived.
   Mr. Steiger may be an effective bargainer in the halls of
power, and he's uncommonly funny for a politico, but his
people skills on the campaign trail are being tested. Like
many successful and/or wealthy men, he can seem oblivious to
indignities felt by those below his station, his gruff humor
only making matters worse. At a small Kiwanis luncheon in
May, Mr. Steiger joked a couple of times about the uninspired
Red Lobster venue. This was received well enough, but then he
tried a variant of the "food's not so good, but the service
is lousy" line in front of the waiter. The youth wore one of
the chain's "Star Performer" pins, and despite an "only
kidding" assurance, the candidate didn't leave 'em laughing
at that one.
   Nevertheless, for much of the electorate, a contrast
between Mr. Steiger and the likely Democratic nominee, the
recently resigned mayor of Phoenix, Terry Goddard, could work
in the GOP's favor. Mr. Goddard, himself the son of a former
Arizona governor, is perceived as a yuppie. Before that
match-up can occur, though, Mr. Steiger must turn back Mr.
Mecham, who retains a loyal following, and Mr. Symington, the
pick of the corporate elite.
   Polls show the three Republicans in a tight race, but Mr.
Steiger isn't listening to any numbers anyway. He's only
speaking his mind. Just don't expect to hear from him while
he's driving.

   WASHINGTON -- The Energy Department announced it will
comply with a federal court order and begin negotiations with
a TRW Inc. subsidiary on a possible award of a 10-year, $1
billion contract.
   TRW Environmental Safety Systems Inc. lost out in initial
bidding for the contract to a consortium led by Bechtel
Systems Management Inc., a subsidiary of Bechtel Group. But
TRW went to court and won a federal claims court order last
August barring award of the contract, as it was originally
solicited, to anyone but TRW.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department had been planning to appeal the
ruling. However, it announced Friday it is changing course to
try to prevent further delays in work on its high-level
nuclear-waste disposal program. The department said it will
drop its appeal "if a mutually satisfactory contractual
agreement can be achieved" with TRW.
   Although TRW wasn't the agency's first choice, it called
the company "a qualified contractor capable of successfully
performing the work." The contract is for systems
engineering, development and management services for the
government's waste program. The department currently is
evaluating a Yucca Mountain, Nev., site for possible use as
the first permanent dump for highly radioactive waste from
nuclear power plants.
   The department said the Bechtel-led consortium was barred
from receiving the contract "through no fault of its own."
TRW had alleged in claims court that the selection process
was illegal and that the department used different criteria
than it had said it would when it selected Bechtel.

   MEXICO CITY -- Shareholders of Telefonos de Mexico
approved a recapitalization plan that should pave the way for
the state-controlled Mexican telephone monopoly's
privatization.
   The recapitalization, which includes a stock dividend of
new, limited-voting shares, is designed to reduce the size of
the investment a buyer will need to obtain operating control
of the company, Mexican officials said. Under the plan,
full-voting shares will be reduced to just 40% of the total
shares oustanding; the buyer will need to obtain the majority
of only the full-voting shares to gain operating control. The
government currently holds an interest of slightly more than
50% in Telmex.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new capital structure was approved by 87% of
shareholders at a special meeting Friday afternoon. In New
York, amid investor nervousness over the plan, Telmex's
American depositary receipts were the most actively traded
stock on the Nasdaq, closing at $1.53 bid, down 18 cents.
Under the plan, Telmex will use $230 million in accumulated
earnings to issue a dividend of 1.5 shares of new Class L
stock for each share held. The Class L shares will have
limited voting rights.
   Of the 40% of shares outstanding with full voting rights,
slightly more than half will be held by the government. A
group seeking operating control of Telmex would have to pay
roughly $1.5 billion for the government's full voting shares,
based on recent market prices.

   Investors in Britain Raise an Eyebrow
   To Big Board's Nighttime Trading Plan

   LONDON -- Among British investors being wooed by the New
York Stock Exchange with its plan to trade stocks in the wee
hours, reaction runs the gamut from lukewarm acceptance to
icy opposition.
   Some big investors doubt there will be enough heavy
hitters to provide smooth trading during the graveyard shift.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the plan, continuous trading in Big Board issues
would be conducted by computer after the exchange closes at 4
p.m. Eastern time, which is 9 p.m. London time. The Big Board
said it would begin such trading this year, but hasn't
specified dates. Starting in 1991, it also would let brokers
enter potential trades all night, with computers matching and
executing orders at 8 p.m. (1 a.m. in London), midnight (5
a.m.) and 5 a.m. (10 a.m.).
   The plan is designed partly to woo business from London's
International Stock Exchange, where the Seaq International
system trades 49 Big Board issues. The London system recently
has amassed a healthy, but far from enormous, chunk of volume
in Big Board stocks, mostly when the New York market was
closed. Between last February, when London began keeping such
statistics, and the end of May, Seaq International volume in
those stocks totaled 816 million shares -- about one good
week of volume in New York.
   The London exchange said Friday that it hadn't any plans
to expand trading hours in response to the Big Board's move.
The London market is open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., but
Seaq International trades can take place at any time. Few
dealers linger after the close, however.
   Investors are concerned about inadequate service in an
after-hours market. "I'm skeptical about how much liquidity
would be provided," Graeme Johnson, a fund manager for
Glasgow-based Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, said.
"Trading should be fairly thin. That would mean wide spreads
and greater volatility. We would reserve judgment as to
whether we'd trade."
   Moreover, the Big Board plan seems to overlook the
long-view approach many British investors take. Baillie
Gifford &amp; Co., an Edinburgh-based fund manager, said this is
why it isn't interested in the Big Board's plan. Gavin J.N.
Gemmell, chief pension investments manager, said: "We try to
buy stocks in successful companies and hold them for a long
period. We don't care if we pay an extra eighth {of a point,
or 12.5 cents, for a share}. If we've made the basic decision
right, we're going to make a lot of money, anyway. If you've
got that basic attitude, it doesn't make much sense to come
into the office in the middle of the night."
   Even some who cautiously endorsed the idea predicated this
on the after-hours market's attracting enough trading volume
to minimize wild price swings. But they acknowledged that
their reticence could lessen the new market's chances of
success. "We're cautiously positive. The move is a good one,"
Ian Young, U.S. investment manager for Norwich Union
Insurance Group, said. "If the liquidity is there, we're
prepared to use it."
   Some investors, while generally opposed to the plan, said
after-hours trading could be a useful tool in emergencies,
such as the October market plunges of 1987 and 1989. "We
certainly wouldn't trade after hours as a matter of course,
but we probably would do it in exceptional circumstances when
quite a lot of dealing has to be done," said Richard A.
Barfield, chief investment manager for Edinburgh-based
Standard Life Assurance Co.
   Some London units of Big Board member firms, eager for
more business in a market long bereft of heavy volume,
welcomed the plan. "It must help us. These are serious moves"
by the Big Board, Bernie Leaver, head of equity trading at
Shearson Lehman Hutton International Inc., said. "If that's
the way of the world, we're ready for it."

   TOKYO -- Chrysler Corp. will soon get help selling its

   Honda, the target of a recent Chrysler advertising
campaign, said it agreed to help the No. 3 U.S. auto maker
sell its Jeep Cherokee and Wrangler models in Japan beginning
this fall.
</LP>

   Honda said it plans to sell 2,000 Jeep models in 1991.
Chrysler sold only 1,500 cars and Jeeps in Japan last year.
   Honda and Chrysler officials previously disclosed they
were negotiating a distribution agreement, but details
weren't announced until Friday.
   A Chrysler spokeswoman said there is "potential for
discussion about Honda distribution of other Chrysler
vehicles" but declined to elaborate.
   Honda, which doesn't build off-road vehicles or minivans,
said it entered into the agreement to help broaden its appeal
in the Japanese market. A Honda spokesman said the Chrysler
ad campaign that claims Chrysler models are superior to
Honda's Civic and Accord never deterred the Japanese company
from going ahead with the marketing alliance.
   "This agreement is not a matter of helping anybody; it's a
matter of Honda dealers expanding sales," the Honda spokesman
said.
   Honda said it will sell and service Chrysler vehicles
through its 1,375-dealer Primo chain.

   Norway May End Output Restrictions
   It Imposed on Itself in Support of OPEC

   OSLO -- Norway, an independent North Sea oil producer, may
eliminate output restrictions imposed on itself four years
ago in support of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   "It is likely we will not continue these measures" for the
second half of the year, Eivind Reiten, the Norwegian oil
minister, said in an interview. Since 1986, Norway has
voluntarily held its expanding production below capacity in
sympathy with OPEC's similar efforts to bolster prices by
limiting output. Currently, Norway pumps 5% less oil than it
could.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rescinding the so-called holdback would mean little to the
volume of oil reaching world markets, adding only about
80,000 barrels a day to the nearly 1.7 million a day Norway
pumps. But the country's posture plays a psychological role
in jittery oil markets. Norway was among the first -- and now
is the last -- non-OPEC producer to curb output in a goodwill
gesture to OPEC.
   "We are very pragmatic about it," said Mr. Reiten. He said
current oil market conditions suggest Norway no longer needs
to hold down production. While petroleum markets recently
have softened because of high OPEC production, prices still
are nearly double the lows reached during 1986 when Norway
volunteered to cooperate in production-cutting.
   In fact, Mr. Reiten, named oil minister only a few months
ago, has already been changing Norway's policies; in January,
he reduced the holdback to the current level from 7.5%.
   Mr. Reiten cited other reasons for putting the entire
policy under review. He noted that most OPEC members except
Saudi Arabia are currently exceeding that organization's
production quotas, and that "we seem to be the only country
outside OPEC doing anything at all." He said Norway might
consider production coordination again "if the situation
changes."
   Meantime, the country is actively expanding capacity --
largely by developing smaller fields. Mr. Reiten disclosed
that he will present applications in two months to Norway's
parliament to begin development of two such new fields.
   Also, Norway will take bids for exploration licenses on 52
offshore tracts in September, the country's 13th such
licensing round and one of its largest ever. The tracts are
divided about equally between the Norwegian sectors of the
North Sea and the Barents Sea. Although Mr. Reiten said oil
companies are "queuing up" for the bidding, the Barents Sea
has proved disappointing for Norway so far. "The North Sea is
much more promising than expected," he said.
   He estimated current spending for exploration and
development of North Sea fields at a record 30 billion to 35
billion Norwegian kroner ($4.62 billion to $5.4 billion)
annually.
   Although North Sea oil workers have threatened to strike
July 1 and close production temporarily, Norway's total
output is expected to continue rising, at least for a few
more years. "We will see a peaking of production at two
million barrels a day around 1995," Mr. Reiten said. "We
expect it to continue that level for another five or six
years" and then start to drop, he said.

   MADRID -- The Madrid stock exchange plans to spend 1.1

options market, expected to come into operation sometime in
1991, officials said.
   As a first step, a 340 million peseta agreement is
expected to be signed in Frankfurt this week covering
computer software, technical assistance and personnel
training.
</LP>

   The system to be acquired is the DTB system in use on the
Frankfurt stock exchange. That system is based on the Zurich
stock exchange's Soffrex system, Madrid officials said.
   The total cost of the project, including the computer
equipment, is expected to be about 1.1 billion pesetas. The
Madrid exchange hopes part of this cost will be borne by
Spain's three regional stock exchanges, making the options
market a joint project.
   Separately, market sources said Volkswagen AG of West
Germany is expected to become the first foreign company
quoted on the Madrid stock exchange. They said Volkswagen
shares are expected to be quoted in the next few weeks in the
form of depositary receipts.

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
   Hopes to Secure
   Bank Guarantee

   LONDON -- Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. hopes to win a #45 million
(US$76.9 million) bank guarantee this week so that its
advertising agencies can keep booking commercials on British
television stations.
   But some of the troubled ad giant's 20 banks apparently
are balking. The bankers may demand a stiff price: toughened
terms for Saatchi's recently renewed $450 million line of
credit. "That is something Saatchi may have to consider,"
said one knowledgeable individual. The recalcitrant banks
"would rather not do it {the guarantee}" because "it's a risk
on top of a fairly fully drawn {lending} facility," this
person added.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Saatchi spokesman said the company has nearly completed
several weeks of negotiations over the bank guarantee.
"Whenever it is required, we'll have it," he said, but
declined to elaborate.
   Officials of Saatchi's lead banks, including Barclays Bank
PLC, Chase Manhattan Bank and Citibank, also declined comment
Friday about the guarantee talks. The consortium of 20 banks
renewed the broader $450 million credit line earlier this
year to cover all of Saatchi's financial obligations over the
next three years.
   "Saatchi is a very borrowed company," observed Mark
Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, a British
brokerage firm. "Most banks don't want to expand their
exposure for something they aren't very happy with."
   The ITV Association, which represents British commercial
TV companies, asked Saatchi for the guarantee last month, the
knowledgeable person said. The company is supposed to arrange
the backing before an association committee meets this week.
Without support from all 20 banks, Saatchi may have to ask
the association for more time or to "reduce its demand," this
individual suggested.
   The association requests such bank guarantees when it
becomes concerned about ad agencies' financial condition.
Saatchi never had to provide such a guarantee before, the
Saatchi spokesman said, although other big advertising groups
have done so. Saatchi, saddled with heavy debt from a flawed
diversification strategy, recently posted a #7 million net
loss for the fiscal first half and omitted its dividend for
the first time.
   The bank guarantee covers the highest amount that agencies
expect to spend on TV commercials during two consecutive
months over the next year, according to Susan de Cesare, the
association's agency executive. The association may withdraw
credit from agencies which fail to arrange a bank guarantee.
These agencies then must "pay for it {air time} up front or
they can't book it," she added.

   Dravo Corp., Pittsburgh, said it has resumed its shell
dredging in southern Louisiana following a consent judgment
ending a lengthy dispute over the legality of Dravo's leases.
Dredging had been suspended last May 25.
   Dravo said the dispute began in 1983 over procedures in
which the company obtained leases to dredge for shells, which
it uses as an aggregate in road construction. The agreement
deletes from the leases three specific areas that previously
had been included in the dredging tracts, Dravo said, but
impact on shell recovery "will be minimal."

   Crackdown in Romania

   A woman named Florica Ichim is hiding for her life in an
apartment on Petre Cretu Street in Bucharest. Florica Ichim
is the executive editor of Romania Libera, until last week
Romania's biggest opposition daily. Wednesday, Romania Libera
was still printing 1.5 million copies. Early Thursday, its
own printers -- doubtless pushed by the government -- arrived
at the paper's door and beat up the only person around to
greet them -- the receptionist. Then they took clubs to
Romania Libera's printing presses and ransacked editors'
offices. Next arrived vandals who called themselves miners
from the countryside. Their leader told a frightened staffer,
"Romania Libera will not be printed anymore."
   President-elect Ion Iliescu made this sudden surge of
government-initiated brutality official when, in a public
speech, he deemed the Romanian press responsible for the
anti-government uprising that has shaken the capital in past
days. Strangers have already appeared at the doors of Mrs.
Ichim's colleagues with trumped-up excuses for house
searches.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The repression, of course, goes beyond Romania Libera, or
the press in general. Crowds looted offices of opposition
parties and systematically beat up pedestrians. A
photocopying machine at the office of the opposition Liberal
Party was presented on television as evidence that the party
was running a counterfeit operation. Leaders of another
party, the Peasant Party -- a group of oldsters mostly well
into their 70s -- were charged with dealing narcotics.
   It's rather clear that much of this mob is Ceausescu's old
Securitate police. Many of the "miners" who traveled into
Bucharest to aid Mr. Iliescu this past week wore suits --
hardly the garments of workers. Witnesses also report that
the beatings these forces delivered -- they wielded
truncheons and metal cord -- betrayed professional skill.
   That such behavior comes from a government that is the
product of the freest election Romania has experienced in 40
years is disheartening. What is clear is that whatever
mandate Mr. Iliescu garnered in last month's elections is now
cracking. Petre Roman, Romania's prime minister, and Silviu
Brucan, another leading figure, spent this weekend taking
care to distance themselves from the bloody Iliescu
crackdown. There will be a simple way to recognize when real
change has returned to Romania. It will be the moment when
Mrs. Ichim is able to start printing a free paper again.

   To Trim Mining Operations

   JOHANNESBURG -- Anglo American Corp. of South Africa said
it will curtail mining operations at two of its subsidiaries
because of the plummeting price of gold.
   Anglo American said the moves at its Free State
Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd. and Vaal Reefs Exploration &amp;
Mining Co. subsidiaries would cut at least 7,800 jobs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The price of gold reached a four-year low of $346.25 an
ounce in New York and London last Thursday before recovering
amid central bank buying. Gold is South Africa's major
industry, earning more than half the country's foreign
currency.
   Lionel Hewitt, managing director of Anglo American's gold
and uranium division, said the curtailment of operations will
take place over the next nine months. He said the cutbacks at
Vaal Reefs won't necessarily eliminate jobs, because workers
may be assigned to other areas of the mine.
   Operating reductions at Free State will reduce its gold
output by less than 1%, while the proposed action at Vaal
Reefs probably will improve production, Mr. Hewitt said.

   Do We Want
   U.S. to Be Rich
   Or Japan Poor?

   Which of these futures do you prefer?
   (a) Between now and 2000, the American economy grows a
respectable 25%, but the Japanese economy grows a whopping
75%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   (b) Between now and 2000, the American economy grows only
10%, and the Japanese economy grows an anemic 10.3%.
   If you chose (b), you're in good company. I've posed the
same choice to several groups of people in recent months -- a
class of Harvard graduate students, a conference of
executives of large American corporations, a conference of
Wall Street investment bankers, a gathering of senior State
Department bureaucrats, a meeting of several hundred citizens
of Belmont, Mass., and a gathering of professional
economists. A majority of every group except the last voted
for (b). The economists all voted for (a).
   Why would so many people prefer (b)? The economists had a
hard time believing that thoughtful Americans willingly would
choose to sacrifice a gain in wealth of 15 percentage points.
The answer, I think, is that the non-economists looked at
relative gains. They don't want the Japanese to catch up with
us and then move ahead. The specter of an economic goliath
towering over the U.S. from across the Pacific frightens them
to the core.
   ---
   This is the dark side of America's relationship with Japan
that never gets talked about, but colors everything else.
Forget the trade imbalances, the negotiations over whether
they'll buy our baseball bats or allow Boone Pickens to buy
their companies, the interminable "structural impediments
initiatives" and summit meetings, the righteous American
indignation over Japanese "dumping" and unfair subsidies to
Japanese companies. We say that all we want is a "level
playing field," but that's not quite true. We also want our
team to remain bigger and stronger than theirs.
   Japan could agree to every one of our demands to buy more
American goods and invite in more American investors, and yet
the (b) problem would remain and probably get worse. The
Japanese economy is growing fast not because Japan keeps us
out but because the Japanese are investing like mad and
working like hell. America is growing slowly because
Americans are doing neither.
   Americans who choose (b) won't be satisfied until the
widening gap in the growth rates of Japan and the U.S. begins
to close and America regains the lead. But for this to happen
we would have to radically step up our investment in
factories, machinery, research, education, training, roads,
ports and everything else that would equip us to produce
more. And we'd have to work harder, longer and better. The
Japanese, on the other hand, would have to learn to live it
up -- stop investing as much and be less diligent on the job.
   ---
   If all this seems unlikely to happen, there's another,
more insidious, remedy the (b) choosers might ultimately
pursue. Disconnect the trade and investment lines between the
two nations -- lines that have fueled our growth and fueled
theirs even faster: Block Japanese imports, bar Japanese
investments, prevent the Japanese from acquiring U.S.
technologies. Both nations would lose -- but the Japanese
would lose more. America would sacrifice the gains of (a) to
prevent Japan from enjoying the much larger gains of (a).
   It has not yet come to this, but it may. American
anxieties temporarily subside each time the Japanese
cautiously accede to U.S. demands to open their market and
buy more American goods, as in the most recent accord. But in
a few months, when Americans once again ponder Japan's
growing economic might, the anxieties may come back even
larger than before.
   Are the (b) choosers irrational and irresponsible? Or are
they wisely responding to the "Realpolitik" of global power,
and the lessons of world history? I'm enough of an economist
to think it must be the former, but not so much of one that I
don't have a lingering doubt. I do know that unless we
confront the (b) crowd's fears openly and directly, our
long-term relationship with Japan will continue to
deteriorate -- regardless of how many American baseball bats,
modems, Toys `R' Us franchises, and Boone Pickenses they
allow in.

   Law:
   Siegel's Cooperation With U.S. Results
   In Lenient Sentence for Securities Fraud

   NEW YORK -- In a move that reflects the extraordinary
value that courts and prosecutors place on cooperation by
defendants in securities fraud cases, former Wall Street
investment banker Martin A. Siegel was sentenced to two
months in prison for his crimes.
   In imposing the lenient sentence, U.S. District Judge
Robert J. Ward said that the two securities fraud-related
felony counts to which Mr. Siegel pleaded guilty in February
1987 were "serious." But Judge Ward added that Mr. Siegel's
"cooperation, his contrition and his candor under difficult
circumstances" prompted him to order a much lighter sentence
than many had expected. Mr. Siegel could have been sentenced
to as long as 10 years in prison.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judge Ward also noted that the government's position, put
forth in a sentencing memo released on Friday, was "not
typical." The government, in its memo and in court, praised
Mr. Siegel as a "credible and reliable" witness who
cooperated despite "an intense campaign of villification."
The government said the assistance of the 42-year-old Mr.
Siegel enabled prosecutors to learn about wrongdoing they
would not otherwise have uncovered.
   The sentencing of Mr. Siegel, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.'s
former chief takeover strategist, ended a saga that began on
Nov. 14, 1986, when a federal marshal thrust a subpoena into
Mr. Siegel's hands relating to his dealings with Ivan F.
Boesky, the convicted former stock speculator. Mr. Boesky's
cooperation, which began the insider trading investigation,
led the government to Mr. Siegel.
   Mr. Siegel began cooperating with the government and
eventually pleaded guilty to exchanging insider information
with Mr. Boesky and with Robert M. Freeman, the former head
of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. Mr. Siegel also paid
more than $9 million in fines.
   Mr. Siegel's cooperation proved a bonanza for the
government. The Kidder unit agreed in June 1987 to pay $25.3
million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges
in connection with Mr. Siegel's actions. The government also
disclosed for the first time in its sentencing memo that
leads provided by Mr. Siegel resulted in the conviction last
year of five officials of Princeton/Newport Partners and a
former Drexel trader on racketeering and other charges.
   Mr. Freeman pleaded guilty last August to one felony
count. Mr. Freeman, who had long denied that he had done
anything wrong, admitted to using inside information received
from Mr. Siegel in connection with the proposed takeover of
Beatrice Cos. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. In April, Mr.
Freeman was sentenced to four months in jail.
   The government has said the crime to which Mr. Freeman
pleaded guilty was one of many he committed. But until
Friday, the government hadn't elaborated on Mr. Freeman's
other alleged misdeeds. In its memo, the government said that
beginning in 1984, Messrs. Freeman and Siegel passed inside
information to each other about companies involved in "at
least twelve takeover situations."
   The government also said that Mr. Siegel provided credible
information about a 1985 telephone call in which Mr. Siegel
received a tip from Mr. Freeman about Unocal Corp. Mr. Siegel
then ordered Kidder traders to buy securities based on that
tip. The government said in the memo that it also seized a
tape from Princeton/Newport on which Mr. Freeman is heard
giving that defunct firm similar information about Unocal.
   On Friday, Mr. Freeman's attorneys continued to deny that
he had engaged in further wrongdoing. "Mr. Freeman has taken
and passed a lie detector test on his statements that no
illicit arrangement with Siegel ever existed and that he
never deliberately gave Siegel confidential information to
help Siegel make a trading decision," the attorneys, Paul
Curran and Robert Fiske Jr., said in a statement.
   According to individuals familiar with the drafting of the
government's memo, Messrs. Curran and Fiske successfully
sought to block the government from including more details
about Mr. Freeman's actions. Those details were included in a
probation report that was not made public. Mr. Curran
declined to comment.
   Mr. Siegel had accepted $700,000 in cash payments from Mr.
Boesky in 1983 and 1984 in exchange for information he
provided to Mr. Boesky. Judge Ward noted that the profits of
Mr. Boesky, who recently completed a three-year prison term,
totaled $30 million.
   "After Mr. Boesky received a three-year sentence {in
1987}, I began to think about Mr. Siegel," Judge Ward said.
"At that time, I was of the view that" a prison term of "18
months to two years would be reasonable" for Mr. Siegel.
   Judge Ward said that in the "intervening period, I was
advised that the government wished to defer Mr. Siegel's
sentence because of his cooperation." Largely because of that
cooperation, Judge Ward decided that Mr. Siegel should serve
"a sentence less than imposed on Mr. Freeman," who has
refused to cooperate with the government.
   Legal experts say that Judge Ward is likely to be attacked
for the lenient sentence. Jed Rakoff, an attorney for Mr.
Siegel, said: "The sentence was fair and just and reflected
very well on the degree to which Judge Ward immersed himself
in the particulars of the case."
   Mr. Siegel was also sentenced to five years probation and
ordered to perform 1,500 hours of community service in
Jacksonville, Fla., near his home. He is to begin serving the
sentence on July 16.

   Thrift Agency Transfers the Deposits
   Of Two Insolvent Texas S&amp;Ls to Sunbelt

   The federal government transferred the deposits of two
deeply insolvent thrifts in San Antonio, Texas, to Sunbelt
Savings of Dallas in hopes of creating an entity that will be
more attractive to potential buyers.
   Sunbelt assumed $2.1 billion in deposits from Bexar
Savings Association and Gill Savings Association, in a
transaction estimated to cost taxpayers about $1.68 billion,
the Resolution Trust Corp. announced.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sunbelt, a federally owned and subsidized thrift, was
created in the 1988 consolidation of eight S&amp;Ls that included
some of the most notorious thrifts from the Texas real-estate
bust. The government installed new management in hopes of
improving the institution's condition and eliciting investor
interest. But Sunbelt has been burdened by high-cost deposits
and a bleak lending market, and regulators now hope the
transfer of Bexar's and Gill's deposits will make Sunbelt a
more appealing acquisition target.
   Separately, the RTC said it sold its entire portfolio of
loan holdings in Alaska. The S&amp;L cleanup agency, under
increased pressure to speed sales of S&amp;Ls and their
investments, is beginning to make headway. The RTC has
targeted the sale of 141 institutions in the April-June
quarter, which would be its speediest pace ever. If all are
sold, about $200 million in operating costs for those thrifts
will be saved this year, said Lamar Kelley, who is in charge
of asset sales for the RTC.
   In what the RTC hopes will be the first step in a quick
disposal of its Alaskan assets, Security Pacific Bank Alaska,
the Anchorage-based unit of Security Pacific Corp., acquired
a portfolio of distressed loans, including commercial loans,
mortgages and consumer loans, for $29 million, mostly from
Home Savings of Anchorage. The loans were originally carried
on the thrift's books for roughly $70 million.
   The heavy write-down wasn't unexpected, Mr. Kelley said.
"These were severely distressed loans, so we were extremely
pleased with the transaction," he said. Security Pacific had
previously purchased the deposits of Home Savings.
   Moreover, a small amount of real estate holdings remain in
Alaska, Mr. Kelley said, and the agency expects to auction
the 352 properties, carried on RTC books at a value of $53.3
million. By selling all the Alaskan holdings quickly, the RTC
hopes to avoid the overhead of opening a permanent sales
office in the state, he said.
   About $140 billion of the RTC's $173 billion in assets is
held in financial instruments such as loans and securities,
and not all are performing. The agency hopes to begin
publishing a schedule of sales of loan packages this summer,
Mr. Kelley said.
   Several other loan packages were sold recently. American
Express Co.'s Lehman Brothers unit acquired $165 million in
commercial real estate loans originally held by Atlantic
Financial Federal Savings &amp; Loan, Bala Cynwyd, Pa. The
package included separate pools of adjustable-rate mortgages
and fixed-rate loans.
   Other loan packages are to be sold in the form of
securities. First Boston Corp. has been selected to structure
a senior subordinated pass-through security to be completed
this summer for $350 million in single-family home mortgages,
and loans that aren't conforming with secondary-market
standards. These loans were originated by University Savings
&amp; Loan, Houston.
   The RTC is also in the final bidding stages for a $1
billion auto-loan operation from Empire of America, Buffalo,
N.Y., Mr. Kelley said.
   In the Sunbelt transaction, Sunbelt will absorb the
deposits of the two San Antonio thrifts, while the RTC will
retain all of their assets. The agency will advance $2.1
billion to Sunbelt, and asset sales are expected to reduce
the government's cost from this transaction to $1.68 billion.
   Gill had assets of $1.1 billion and liabilities of about
$2 billion, the RTC said, while Bexar had assets of $874
million and liabilities of $946 million. Sunbelt, with $9
billion in assets, posted a fourth-quarter loss of $7.4
million, which included an undisclosed amount of federal
assistance. It had repossessed assets of $2.57 billion and
past-due loans of $1.17 billion at year end, the largest pile
of bad assets at any thrift in the country.
   Other RTC actions Friday included:
   -- Unifirst Bank for Savings, Jackson, Miss., with $700
million in assets, was sold in a transaction that is expected
to ultimately cost the RTC $121.6 million. Mississippi buyers
of separate branches included Trustmark National Bank,
Jackson; Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., Belzoni; Merchants &amp;
Farmers Bank, Kosciusko; Hancock Bank, Gulfport; Newton
County Bank, Newton; Merchants National Bank, Vicksburg; Port
Gibson Bank, Port Gibson.
   -- First Savings &amp; Loan Association, Waco, Texas, with
$375.1 million in assets, was sold to Kilgore Federal Savings
&amp; Loan Association, Kilgore, Texas.
   -- Plano Savings &amp; Loan Association, Plano, Texas, with
$256.3 million in assets, was sold to First Gibraltar Bank,
Plano.
   -- New Mexico Federal Savings Association, Albuquerque,
N.M., with $201.9 million in assets, was sold to First
National Bank in Albuquerque.
   -- First Savings of Laredo, Texas, $175.5 million in
assets, was closed, and depositors are to be paid off within
several days.
   -- Sentinel Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Phoenix,
Ariz., with $171.5 million in assets, was sold to Biltmore
Investors Bank, Phoenix.

   Your Money Matters:
   Before Opting Out of Health Plans
   Take the Pulse of Benefits vs. Costs
   ----

   Your employer may be willing to pay you good money to get
out of the company health plan. Think twice, or maybe three
times, before you accept.
   More and more companies are offering such choices these
days in response to soaring medical costs and the growing
number of two-income families with overlapping
health-insurance plans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The idea is that some of those with duplicate coverage may
prefer to drop out of one of the plans in return for cash or
some alternative benefit. Companies, meanwhile, get to pare
their soaring medical costs.
   But although that can seem appealing, benefits consultants
say a careful comparison of what you'd be giving up and what
you'd be getting is essential. Employees, they say, should
pay special attention to details such as deductibles and
limitations on coverage. It's also important to know what it
would take to get back into the plan if you decide you want
to later.
   "It's something we hope {employees} don't take lightly,"
says Earl W. Hunt, director of employee benefits at Buffalo,
N.Y.-based Marine Midland Bank. About 20% of the bank's
12,000 full-time employees choose not to take medical
insurance every year, opting instead for as much as $400 in
cash or credits for other benefits, such as increased life or
disability insurance or extra vacation days.
   A recent survey of the 5,000 largest U.S. employers by
consultants William M. Mercer Inc. showed that 47% offer or
plan to offer "flexible benefits," compared with 23% just
five years ago. Most of these companies allow employees to
opt out of health coverage. Between 5% and 20% of workers do,
generally getting between $300 and $800 a year in cash or
other benefits.
   "It's partly financial, partly philosophical," says Steven
Fein of Towers Perrin, the New York-based consulting firm.
Employers are saying, "Who are we to tell employees what kind
of coverage they need?"
   Still, many companies require that employees have other
medical insurance before they can opt out of their own plan.
They "don't want someone {who didn't have insurance} sitting
outside corporate headquarters in a wheelchair" after an
accident, says Mr. Fein.
   But it isn't just a question of taking a $70-a-month
payment from one spouse's employer and paying $20 a month for
coverage from the other's. One policy may have a $150
deductible, another $300. One may pay 80% of most medical
expenses, the other 75%. Some plans pay for outpatient
psychological and psychiatric care, others don't.
   Employees have to determine "what coverage is available
and what level of coverage is important to them," says Joan
Gianico, first vice president, benefits compensation, of New
York's Republic National Bank. "We try to remind them of what
their individual circumstances are."
   Whether a plan covers prescription drugs, for instance,
can be important to someone taking regular medication for a
heart condition or asthma. A family with children might not
want to give up a plan that covers well-child care.
   Benefits professionals say the two key questions for
employees before opting out of a medical plan are how well
they would be covered in case of a catastrophe and how easy
it would be to get back into the plan if their circumstances
change.
   Limits on out-of-pocket expenses can vary from one plan to
another. Some plans set a lifetime maximum on payments, which
could have a severe impact on someone permanently injured in
an auto accident, for instance, who might require full-time
care for life. There are plans that would pay for 365 days of
hospitalization, while others only cover 120. Cancer, heart
disease or a premature birth can easily become a financial
disaster without adequate insurance coverage.
   Companies can be tough if someone wants to get back into a
medical plan. Most allow immediate re-enrollment if other
coverage is lost, as in the case of divorce or because the
spouse loses a job. But sometimes the deductible is higher or
pre-existing conditions aren't covered for some period of
time.
   Employees who just change their minds about coverage
generally have to wait for the annual re-enrollment period,
usually in the fall, to take effect the following Jan. 1.
Pre-existing conditions often aren't covered for the first
year, and some companies require proof of insurability,
usually based on a medical examination. "You may find that
you're not covered for just what you need {insurance} for,"
says Douglas Carey of Hewitt Associates, a Lincolnshire,
Ill., consulting firm.
   Few companies require actual proof of other coverage. In
such cases, the employee generally is required to sign a form
stating the name of the company providing the alternate
coverage. Mr. Hunt of Marine Midland says a recent survey of
employees did turn up a few who were going without medical
insurance, despite having signed a statement that they had
coverage.
   As tempting as the extra vacation days or cash may be to
the young and healthy, "it's real dangerous" not to have
medical insurance, says Mr. Carey of Hewitt Associates. "You
never know when you're going to be in an accident, when
something serious is going to happen. The fact is that
hospitals in this country treat you better if you have
coverage than if you don't."
   Companies surveyed last year by Towers Perrin said that
even in the event of a catastrophe, employees would have to
live with their decision to turn down medical coverage. A few
companies said they would help the employee find other
assistance, such as welfare. Mr. Fein, the consultant, says,
"If word got out that you could take the {cash payment} and
still be covered, everyone would take the cash."

   Station Sounds Out
   A Kids' Wavelength

   RADIO entrepreneur Christopher Dahl wants to become the
Wizard of Aahs.
   To put advertisers in touch with kids, he's trying to
establish the Children's Radio Network, a programming service
that would be distributed nationwide by satellite. His
prototype is called Radio Aahs, pronounced Oz.
   The format, being developed on WWTC-AM in Minneapolis,
includes youngster DJs spinning requests from listeners, a
call-in show, a theater of the air, Sesame Street-style
educational fare and reruns of such Golden Age of Radio shows
as "The Lone Ranger."
   If it works, Mr. Dahl's CD Broadcasting Co. hopes to link
up several dozen markets with feeds that would be
interspersed with live local programming. The target audience
is kids under 12, but the station figures it will reach
parents who are within earshot.
   "It's a market that hasn't been served," he says, adding
that many AM station operators are looking for a new niche.
"We're finding a lot of music out there that kids have been
listening to on their Walkman" that's not played on the
radio, he says.
   So far Radio Aahs has attracted advertisers such as
McDonald's, Domino's Pizza, the Target Stores division of
Dayton Hudson Corp., along with a record shop chain, a pet
store, an amusement park and even a car dealer. "A great deal
of buying decisions on cars are made by mothers and kids,"
Mr. Dahl contends.
   But some ads the under-age audience won't hear. Besides
such obvious no-nos as beer, Radio Aahs won't plug soft
drinks containing caffeine.

   The End of the Line?
   Overkill on Extensions
                                                                                                       

   LINE EXTENSIONS have long been a popular way to leverage a
lustrous brand name. Witness Arm &amp; Hammer, whose venerable
baking-soda franchise now has expanded into toothpaste,
fabric-softener sheets for dryers and room deodorizers.
   But brands, like businesses, can become overextended.
Eventually brand equity runs out, says Joel Rubinson, an
official of NPD Group Inc., a market research firm.
   Mr. Rubinson thinks the line-extension cycle has about
peaked. "There's a definite need for new brand names," he
says. In the 1970s, only 22% of the products tested by the
Port Washington, N.Y., concern were extensions; in the '80s,
that figure nearly tripled. Mr. Rubinson says a preoccupation
with product spinoffs has left some companies vulnerable
because they haven't put enough time or money into building
new brand franchises.
   As line extensions turn off consumers, some companies will
make brand acquisitions. Others will create new brands.
   That's what Honda Motor Co. did to market its Integra and
Legend luxury models. It launched the Acura brand rather than
add the cars into its Honda line. Similarly, to build new
foundations in pet foods, Mars Inc. dumped the Kalkan name
domestically in favor of three distinct labels, Whiskas and
Sheba for cats and Pedigree for dogs.
   But many companies still think line extensions are the
easiest way to go. And those managers looking for
acquisitions increasingly are likely to examine brand
beachheads for their line-extension potential -- and limits,
Mr. Rubinson says.
                                                                                                       

   Hoopsters Snuff Out
   Smoking, Cigarette Ads
                                                                                                       

   THE MINNESOTA Timberwolves are giving up smoking -- and
some big advertising bucks.
   When the National Basketball Association expansion team
moves into a new downtown Minneapolis arena this fall, fans
will be prohibited from lighting up anywhere in the building.
Most NBA arenas bar smoking in the game area but allow it in
the concourses.
   "We did it because I believe that if smoking were
introduced today it would be outlawed," says Marvin
Wolfenson, co-owner of the team.
   The ban goes beyond puffing. Tobacco advertising and
cigarette sales will be prohibited throughout the building,
which is shared with a health club. Mr. Wolfenson estimates
that the stand will cost the 'Wolves at least $500,000 a year
in lost ad revenue. "Sure it's a sacrifice," he says, "but we
think it's right."
   Alcohol is another story. The Timberwolves named Miller
Brewing Co. as the arena's exclusive beer vendor. Mr.
Wolfenson concedes it's ironic that Miller's parent is
cigarette giant Philip Morris Cos.
   Another NBA arena, the Salt Palace in Salt Lake City,
dodged a big beer-company ad revenue loss. Changes in Utah's
alcohol laws had forced the Palace to cover two large Coors
scoreboard signs, worth about $80,000 in revenue. But lawyers
found a loophole. The company will replace its beer trademark
with signs bearing the corporate name, Adolph Coors Co. The
rationale: The Golden, Colo., concern also bottles spring
water.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   MCDONALD'S HOPES that its three new Fs -- "food, folks and
fun" -- satisfy its other big F: franchisees. Before rolling
out its latest marketing campaign, the chain got some
stinging criticism from licensee operators fed up with
earlier efforts. A recent survey found only 32% thought the
company's product promotions were working, compared with 77%
two years ago. A McDonald's spokesman says operators at last
month's national convention applauded the new ads. . . .To
push a book on child-rearing, Polybius Press of Houston sent
copies to hundreds of school superintendents asking them to
review "Mothers, Leadership and Success" for their local
newspapers. About 90 did.

   STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's foreign trade surplus narrowed to
1.4 billion kronor ($229 million) in May from 2.4 billion
kronor in April but was wider than the May 1989 surplus of
700 million kronor, Statistics Sweden said.
   The national statistics agency said preliminary May
figures showed that exports totaled 29.8 billion kronor, up
9% from May 1989, while imports amounted to 28.4 billion
kronor, up 7% from the corresponding month last year.

   LOS ANGELES -- Drought-conscious bureaucrats in Southern
California are employing the latest in electronic
surveillance to identify businesses that use too much water.
   The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is
using pictures from a Landsat satellite circling 450 miles
above the Earth to determine areas of excessive water use.
Computer analysis of the photographs will measure infrared
light waves from plants, with the wettest areas appearing in
bright red. The analysis is being provided under an agreement
between the water district and Terra-Mar Resource Information
Services Inc., Mountain View, Calif.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Homeowners needn't worry just yet about overwatering their
lawns, however. Measurements will only be taken for large
landscaped areas such as golf courses, cemeteries, parks and
big residential projects, as the satellite can only pick up
areas about as big as a football field, a spokesman for the
water district said.
   While the district won't be nabbing water gluttons, "this
data is essential for determining potential water savings in
urban landscaping and will be used in developing future water
conservation programs," says Carl Boronkay, general manager
of the water district, which provides more than half the
water used by 15 million people living in Los Angeles,
Ventura, Orange, San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties. The information will also be used in state water
allocation hearings.

   WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration reversed its policy
and announced it will support a special international fund to
wean developing countries from chemicals that destroy the
Earth's protective ozone layer.
   The change of course removes a stumbling block from an
international conference in London next week that is expected
to accelerate the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons, or
CFCs, which are damaging the upper-atmosphere ozone layer
that filters the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Developing countries, including such giants as India and
China, have insisted they need financial and technological
help, and the industrialized countries expect them to join in
switching to chemicals that are safer for the atmosphere.
   The White House drew strong criticism at home and abroad
last month, when the U.S. objected to an international
proposal to create a fund of at least $100 million. Chief of
Staff John Sununu objected to setting the precedent of a
special environmental fund and insisted aid should be
provided through existing organizations. But
environmentalists and industry and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher appealed to the White House to change its
position.
   A statement issued by Mr. Sununu on the new policy
stipulates the U.S. will support the new fund, and would
donate about $25 million to it over three years, on the
condition that this doesn't set a precedent for further
foreign aid for environmental causes.

   Drexel Creditors' Committee Is Taking
   Depositions of Employees Over Bonuses

   NEW YORK -- The creditors' committee of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc. has begun taking depositions of company
employees to determine whether any improprieties occurred in
the company's controversial bonus payments.
   The committee also is conducting fact-finding interviews
of current and former Drexel officials about transactions
involving gold loaned to Drexel by foreign central banks. The
central banks are estimated to have lost more than $500
million in the deals, in which Drexel paid them interest for
use of the gold as capital.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Robert T. Ladd, an executive vice president of First City,
Texas-Houston who represents the bank on the committee, said
about 50 former and current officials will be questioned in
the next two months. Also under investigation are
partnerships in which Drexel employees benefited from selling
securities underwritten by the company. First City,
Texas-Houston, is the main banking unit of First City
Bancorp. The officials to be questioned include Drexel
President Frederick Joseph and Richard Wright, chief
financial officer.
   Under an order signed Friday by U.S. bankruptcy court
Judge Howard Buschman III, the committee's findings will be
part of a disclosure statement to be released about Dec. 10
that will also include proposals for Drexel's reorganization.
   Mr. Ladd said the investigation could turn up hundreds of
millions of dollars that may be recoverable under bankruptcy
law. He said the committee is focusing on whether Drexel
acted imprudently in granting the bonuses and entering into
the other transactions just months before filing for
bankruptcy-law protection. The creditors have said they won't
seek to recover the bonuses if the liquidation of Drexel's
assets covers its liabilities. Drexel filed under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Feb. 13.
   Drexel has said there was nothing improper about the bonus
payments, the gold transactions or the partnerships.
   If the committee finds any improprieties, the report could
give weight to the creditors' demand that current Drexel
management be ousted in the reorganization. Drexel and the
creditors have until mid-November to come up with a
consensual reorganization plan, but the two sides are far
apart in their negotiations.
   In the order issued by Judge Buschman in federal
bankruptcy court in Manhattan, the committee has until Oct.
31 to analyze potential steps that could be taken to go after
the bonuses or other payments. The depositions must be
completed by Sept. 15.
   The judge also ordered that the value of Drexel's
portfolio of securities be analyzed by Sept. 15. The order
sets Feb. 28, 1991, as the goal for getting a reorganization
plan approved.
   A spokesman for Drexel said the order sets forth "a
reasonable time frame to accomplish what we have to
accomplish, which is to get a consensual plan that is fair to
creditors and to shareholders." He added that the judge's
order doesn't give the creditors any investigative authority
they didn't already have.

   CHICAGO -- Sutton Holding Corp., which has been trying to
acquire DeSoto Inc. since last year, said it will seek three
seats on DeSoto's board.
   Sutton also said it offered to buy certain of DeSoto's
businesses as an alternative to its $50-a-share, or $200
million, tender offer for the Des Plaines, Ill.-based maker
of paints, chemical coatings and detergents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   DeSoto stock fell $3.25 Friday, closing at $40.25 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Two Sutton executives, Chairman William Spier and Senior
Vice President Michael Zurawin, will seek board seats at
Desoto's annual meeting July 16, along with Giorgio Arra, a
Sutton director.
   Sutton and a DeSoto spokesman said the nominations were
made under an agreement with Sutton, a New York investor
group. The election of the three would expand DeSoto's board
to 13 members.
   Saying that DeSoto had failed to enhance shareholder
value, Sutton said it would offer $45 million for DeSoto's
detergent business if the company sold all of its other
businesses. Sutton said it would then take steps to acquire
all of DeSoto's outstanding shares.
   Failing that, Sutton said, it would offer about $90
million for DeSoto's detergent and surfactant businesses.
   In a statement, Sutton said the offers were made because
DeSoto "was having trouble selling certain businesses in a
timely manner."
   Sutton also said it extended its tender offer until
midnight EDT June 25. The offer had been set to expire last
Friday.
   The DeSoto spokesman had no comment on Sutton's
unsolicited offers for DeSoto or its businesses.

   Japan, however, will reject a U.S. request to specify the
size of public works spending as a percentage of gross
national product, government sources said. The figure of 450
trillion yen could be roughly 8% of Japan's GNP, they said.
The plan doesn't include works of the JR Group of railway
companies and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.

   Repsol and La Caixa
   Negotiate to Create

   MADRID -- Repsol S.A., the Spanish state-controlled oil
company, and La Caixa, Spain's largest savings bank, are
understood to be at an advanced stage in negotiations for the
creation of a giant Spanish gas utility.
   The principal remaining question, however, is understood
to be who will be Repsol's partner in the utility: Repsol
wants La Caixa itself as a partner, while the savings bank
would prefer to participate indirectly through water utility
Aguas de Barcelona S.A., of which it is a shareholder.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At stake are Spanish government efforts to reorganize
Spain's fragmented gas industry and keep it under Spanish
control. Repsol officials say their aim is to create a single
large gas utility along the lines of British Gas, Gaz de
France or Belgium's Distrigas.
   Repsol's parent, the state oil and gas agency Instituto
Nacional de Hidrocarburos, is investing heavily through
Repsol's sister company, Enagas, in a project to bring
natural gas by pipeline to Spain from Norway.
   In parallel, Repsol began talks last year aimed at
regrouping its gas activities with those of Spain's biggest
gas utility, Barcelona-based Catalana de Gas S.A.
   But alarm bells rang a few months ago when the U.K.'s
British Gas disclosed it had bought around 8% of Catalana de
Gas.
   The prospect of foreign companies getting an inexpensive
back door into Spain's gas market added impetus to Repsol's
efforts to forge a unified national gas utility.
   To strengthen Repsol's hand, INH launched a bid last month
for control of Gas Madrid, Spain's second largest gas
utility. As a result of this bid, INH now controls 87% of
Enagas, directly and through Repsol.
   The plans under discussion between Repsol and La Caixa
call for the creation of a joint holding company owning
Repsol's holdings in Gas Madrid and a number of regional gas
utilities. The regional interests would include a sizable
stake in Catalana de Gas, which in turn has stakes in gas
firms in Andalusia and Valencia. Repsol owns 11.8% of
Catalana de Gas, and La Caixa owns 24%. Another
Barcelona-based savings bank, Caja de Barcelona, which is
planning to merge with La Caixa, owns 10% of Catalana de Gas.
   But a spokeswoman for La Caixa said the talks, though at
an advanced stage, appear for the moment to have reached a
dead end.
   The reason, she said, was the government's insistence that
La Caixa be Repsol's direct partner in the gas venture.

   ROME -- Italy's unadjusted index of industrial production
rose 1% in April from a year earlier, the state statistical
institute Istat said.
   Istat said the index, on which 1985 equals 100, registered
116.0 in April, compared with 114.9 in April 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The index was based on 19 working days in April, the same
as in April 1989.
   The increase in April followed a year-on-year rise of 2.8%
in March.
   Industrial production in the first four months, which had
a total of 83 working days, rose an average of 2.1% from the
year-earlier period, which had 82 working days.
   In the first four months, production of capital goods rose
5.9% from a year earlier. Production of consumer goods was up
1.2%, while output of intermediate goods was up 1.5%.
   The increase in capital goods was due to an 8.5% rise in
the production of transportation goods, a rise of 5.9% in the
production of machinery and equipment and a drop of 1.6% in
the production of other goods.

   WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court threw out an $11
million jury verdict against Grant Thornton, an accounting
firm that was sued in connection with its audits of
Auto-Train Co. in 1978 and 1979.
   A federal jury in Washington awarded the damages in 1985
for breach of contract, negligence and fraud. The damages
were awarded to Murray Drabkin, the bankruptcy trustee for
Auto-Train, who filed the suit in 1983. Auto-Train ceased
operations in 1981.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The lawsuit charged that Chicago-based Grant Thornton,
formerly Alexander Grant &amp; Co., failed to disclose in its
audits that Auto-Train used funds withheld for federal
payroll taxes to meet its cash needs. The lawsuit also
charged that the audits overestimated the value of
Auto-Train's assets. Because of these omissions, the lawsuit
said, the audits failed to sound alarms about Auto-Train's
worsening financial plight.
   But the appeals court, in a 3-0 decision written by Judge
Stephen Williams, said the evidence on which the jury relied
failed to show that Grant Thornton caused or contributed to
Auto-Train's problems. Moreover, the appeals court noted that
Grant Thornton's audits included qualified opinions on the
company's stability.
   The appeals court ruling didn't establish any new legal
principles. But Kathryn Oberly, a Washington lawyer for Grant
Thornton, said that with lawsuits against accounting firms
becoming more common, "We're delighted to have the appeals
court recognize that, regardless of how badly or how well the
auditing firm did its job, plaintiffs must prove" that the
accountants caused the problem for which a suit seeks to hold
them liable.

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Eastman Kodak Co. and International
Business Machines Corp. said they will jointly develop an
improved computerized publishing system that permits
publishers to add business and other functions to the
electronic system.
   Kodak, of Rochester, N.Y., has been selling Atex
publishing systems for several years. The systems control the
editorial, advertising and production activities involved in
publishing a newspaper or magazine. Kodak said it will
contribute that expertise, focusing on imaging and publishing
systems software.

   IBM, White Plains, N.Y., the world's largest computer
company, is a major supplier of computerized business systems
to the publishing industry. IBM will provide technical,
marketing and development assistance and some financing for
the project. The big computer producer and Kodak both
declined to disclose how much financing IBM will provide.
   Kodak, a photographic products, chemicals and drug
company, has a sizable office-equipment business.
   Automation suppliers in the past few years have been
developing systems that include sales, purchasing,
administration and other functions in the same computerized
system that controls production. The Kodak-IBM venture
intends to supply such a system for publishers. In addition,
they want to establish a system that can readily accept and
communicate with other equipment that third parties currently
manufacture, Kodak said.

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed
to $6.94 billion in April, primarily because a sharp drop in
imports offset a smaller decline in exports, the Commerce
Department reported.
   April's deficit, which compared with an $8.36 billion gap
in March, reflected a 6.2% plunge in imports to $39.25
billion. Exports fell 3.5% to $32.31 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Generally, economists said slow economic growth in the
U.S. pulled imports down in April, and they suggested the
drop in exports may have reflected a slight sag in economies
abroad.
   "This drop in imports is a reflection of the slowdown of
the general {U.S.} economy that has generated less demand,"
said Richard Rippe, chief economist for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in New York. "Now looking at exports . . . this kind of
bouncing around from month to month is not all that unusual;
it might reflect a little slowing down in overseas economies,
but there isn't enough data to substantiate that yet."
   Most economists were reluctant to read much into the
single month's trade numbers. Despite April's fall in
exports, many said they found the overall trend encouraging.
The economies of most major U.S. trading partners are still
quite strong, economists said, suggesting that demand for
U.S. products will continue to be vigorous for some time.
   "Exports are going to enjoy a certain amount of growth
over the next few months, due to demand abroad, particularly
in Western Europe," said Fred Sturm, senior economist for
Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   Overall, economists say they expect the trade deficit to
continue to narrow in coming months. "We are seeing a lower
deficit already . . . and I think we will end this year with
a substantially improved merchandise-trade deficit," said
Kermit Baker, chief economist for Cahners Economics in
Massachusetts.
   Declines in imports were widespread in April. Imports of
cars, clothing, office machinery and general industrial
machinery all fell. Oil imports also dropped, reflecting a
fall in oil prices. But the volume of oil imports shrank as
well, to 226 million barrels from 261 million barrels in
March.
   Exports of aircraft and chemicals increased. But many
other categories showed declines, including office machinery,
power generating machinery, electrical machinery, cars and
general industrial machinery.
   The U.S. trade deficit with Japan, consistently the
largest the U.S. has with any country, widened to $4 billion
from $3.62 billion in March. But the U.S. trade surplus with
Western Europe also continued to swell, nearly doubling in
April to $1.36 billion.
   All the numbers except the trade balances with individual
countries are adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations.

   TORONTO -- Cineplex Odeon Corp., continuing its strategy
of selling off non-core assets to reduce its heavy debt load,
said it has found buyers for 62 of its U.S. movie theaters.
   In one transaction, set to close by the end of June,
Cineplex agreed to sell 24 theaters in North Carolina, South
Carolina and Tennessee to Columbus, Ga.-based Carmike Cinemas
Inc. Cineplex said it would receive between $7 million and
$13 million for the theaters, depending on their operating
cash flow in 1990.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cineplex also agreed to sell 38 movie theaters with 150
screens in Utah, Idaho, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington to
Plitt Amusement Co., Los Angeles, for $31.8 million. That
transaction is scheduled to close by July 31.
   The sales take the motion picture theater chain one step
closer to its goal of raising $200 million through asset
sales by the end of 1990. Under new, more restrictive bank
agreements, Cineplex must complete the asset sales and apply
$135 million of the proceeds to reducing its debt load. At
the end of the first quarter, Cineplex had debt of about $620
million.
   But Cineplex's president and chief executive officer,
Allen Karp, warned that the market for theaters is difficult
and that the company doesn't intend to dispose of assets at
what he called "fire sale prices."
   "We are not going to give assets away," Mr. Karp said
after Cineplex's annual meeting Friday.
   Mr. Karp said an "extremely, extremely healthy
relationship" with the company's two major shareholders, MCA
Inc. and Montreal's Bronfman family, allows him to hold out
for "realistic" prices for the assets. The two major holders
have agreed to invest a total of $100 million in Cineplex if
the company doesn't achieve its asset sale targets, either in
the form of subordinated debt or through a rights offering.
   "I would have felt good if we could have gotten another $5
million or $10 million," Mr. Karp said of the sales. Analysts
note that the movie theater industry is characterized by
overcapacity and a difficult financing environment.

   ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Ireland's Department of
Health authorized the company to market the anti-viral drug
ribavirin for use in the "management" of patients infected
with the human immunodeficiency virus and other conditions
related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The approval, the Costa Mesa, Calif., company said, marks
the first time that a country has authorized the anti-viral
drug specifically for the treatment of HIV-infected patients.
Ribavirin already is used in the U.S. and in 16 other nations
for the treatment of infants and young children with severe
respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory syncytial
virus. Ribavirin is used in more than 30 additional countries
to treat other viral infections.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   ICN recently withdrew its request for U.S. government
approval to market ribavirin for the treatment of the HIV
virus.
   There were about 100 cases of AIDS in Ireland in 1989, and
about half of those victims have since died, according to an
ICN spokesman. He said researchers predict the number of AIDS
patients in Ireland will reach 12,000 by 1995.

   South African Platinum Producers Buy

   LONDON -- South African platinum producers, the biggest in
the world, are buying the metal and an important byproduct,
rhodium, on the international open market because their own
mines and refineries aren't turning out enough, dealers say.
   The metal is being bought to meet sales commitments and
for stockpiling against the possibility of further production
disruptions, dealers explain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mainly as a result of these purchases, platinum at $475 an
ounce is performing far better than gold, which is
languishing around $346 an ounce, a four-year low.
   Its premium over gold has widened to $129, or 38%, against
a premium of $90, or 21%, at the beginning of the year. In
the mid-1980s, platinum traded at a discount to gold.
   Meanwhile, the price of rhodium -- an important byproduct
that is used with platinum and palladium in "three-way"
catalysts to reduce auto pollution emissions -- soared to a
record $3,100 an ounce because of an acute shortage.
   "Earlier this year we gave the first customer who bought
rhodium at $2,000 an ounce a bottle of champagne," says Brian
Nathan, managing director of Ayrton Metals Ltd., London
platinum merchants. At the time, such a price, up from around
$1,250 last August, appeared extraordinary, he says. Now
rhodium's surge shows no signs of slowing. The U.S. General
Services Administration has advised the federal government to
buy 6,000 ounces of rhodium a year to build a stockpile of
30,000 ounces, Mr. Nathan says.
   Tight supply rather than robust demand is bolstering
platinum, rhodium and to a lesser extent palladium, dealers
say. The slim supplies are mainly blamed on the South African
mines, dealers say. They produced 2.6 million ounces of
platinum last year and accounted for 77% of world supplies,
says Johnson Matthey PLC, precious metals refiners and
distributors. The Soviet Union, the next biggest producer,
which last year sold 550,000 ounces or 16% of total supplies,
is also selling smaller amounts this year, Johnson Matthey
says.
   Secretive about their activities in the market, South
African producers are reluctant to disclose details of their
open market purchases.
   The buying could be from several sources, says Edwin
Arnold, metals analyst at Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith
in London. First, there was a two-week strike last month at a
mine of Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd., the largest producer
in the world.
   Production at the operation, known as Atok, almost came to
a standstill and the loss of platinum output was nearly 4,000
ounces, estimates Mr. Arnold. Although the loss was small in
relation to Rustenburg's estimated annual production of 1.4
million ounces, the company probably needs to buy platinum on
the open market for a stockpile as a buffer against any
future disruptions, he says.
   The stockpile idea may look especially good to Rustenburg
because it was production difficulties at Rustenburg's
refinery earlier this year that precipitated the rhodium
price surge.
   Another factor in tight supplies is that output of a new,
though smaller South African mine, Barplats Mine Ltd., is
coming on stream later than expected, Mr. Arnold says. As a
result, the mine had to buy refined metal on the market to
meet sales commitments that were negotiated last year, he
says.
   Shortages of platinum, however, could be less critical in
the next few months, dealers say. Production at Rustenburg's
refinery is back to normal, says Jeremy Coombes, an analyst
at Johnson Matthey, a sales agent of the South African mine.
   Yet prices aren't likely to fall much because demand is
holding up. Although auto sales are declining in the U.S. and
Europe, says Mr. Coombes, the European motor industry needs
three-way catalysts to meet new anti-pollution standards in
the next three years. There are also more stringent
anti-pollution rules in the U.S., so their demand for
platinum and rhodium hasn't fallen.
   "Unless the Soviet Union increases sales, prices of
rhodium could continue to surge," says Oscar Prager, managing
director of Ayrton &amp; Partners Ltd., London metals merchants.
World supplies of rhodium are only a tenth of platinum
supplies, he says. But such a small proportion is used in
auto catalysts that the motor industry isn't concerned about
the price, he says.
   Despite short-term problems, South African platinum mines
are planning to raise production by one million troy ounces,
or 39%, during the next five years, Mr. Coombes says.
Moreover, supplies from South Africa "will rise in 1990 as
new mines build up capacity," he adds.
   Yet some analysts are wary and contend that strikes,
strife and cost inflation will pare the mines' expected
output over the next few years. Platinum will surge to $2,000
an ounce following violence, sabotage and eventually
nationalization of the South African mines, predicts James E.
Ryan, a Bellevue, Wash., precious metals analyst and author
of "Platinum -- The Metal That Could Make You Rich in the
1990's."
   Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:
                                                                                                       

   Energy
                                                                                                       

   If tight gasoline supplies keep pushing prices higher on
the West Coast of the U.S. and East Coast supplies come under
pressure from an oil workers' strike in Brazil, gasoline
futures prices will continue their meteoric rise in trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange this week, analysts say.
   The strength in gasoline, which tested trading limits much
of last week, doesn't necessarily mean good news for crude
oil, however. The July Nymex crude contract, which expires
midweek, fell sharply two days running last week, even as
gasoline made its strong showing. In fact, many trading
decisions were based in part on the relative difference in
prices between the two.
   Several disparate factors that might have helped the
overproduction picture didn't materialize. Oil workers in
Kuwait, a major producer, canceled a planned strike. The Mega
Borg, a Norwegian tanker that was on fire last week in the
Gulf of Mexico, failed to disrupt other tanker traffic. The
tanker, carrying 38.2 million gallons of crude oil, spilled
4.6 million gallons of its cargo before fires were
extinguished and the leaking stopped. Much of the spilled
crude burned, evaporated, was sucked up with skimmers or
eaten by microbes. Tar balls were expected to reach the Texas
and Louisiana coasts late yesterday.
                                                                                                       

   Grains and Soybeans
                                                                                                       

   Analysts predicted upward trends in the prices of corn and
soybean futures this week, after prices plunged late last
week as weather improved in some central growing regions. "I
think we're very close to the bottom price levels right here
at these ranges," said Richard Loewy, president of AgResource
Co., Chicago. Mr. Loewy said he expects the weekly progress
reports issued by Midwest states today to show that farmers
were unable to do much last-minute corn planting in
rain-plagued areas. That should support corn futures prices
throughout this week, he said. The deadline for planting corn
usually is early June.
   Soybean planting also is behind schedule in many Midwest
states, though a week of consistently good weather could give
farmers time to finish planting. Some analysts expect soybean
prices to rise for the week in sympathy with corn.
                                                                                                       

   Orange Juice
                                                                                                       

   Futures prices plunged Friday on a rumor that Brazil might
cut its selling prices, but analysts said they expected a
steady market this week. The July contract ended with a loss
of 10.65 cents a pound at $1.7950 after trading as low as
$1.7530.
   One analyst said the report was denied by the three major
Brazilian processors, who also said they had no present plans
for changing prices.
   The rumor was apparently sparked by a report that some of
the concentrate had been sold in Europe at a discount and
that price declines would follow, the analyst said. As a
result, widespread futures selling developed, causing prices
to fall below several main support price levels, which
accelerated the decline.
   One analyst said he expected prices to continue to be
steady for a while. Another said that although U.S. consumer
demand for orange juice has slackened somewhat because of
high prices, tight supplies should continue to persist during
the summer.

   Scott Paper Co. said it will form a joint venture with
Feldmuhle AG, a West German company, to own and operate
Feldmuhle's sanitary-tissue business.
   Scott, a Philadelphia-based maker of paper products, said
it plans to pay $125 million for a 51% stake in the joint
venture. At Feldmuhle's option or after three years, Scott
would have the right to acquire the remaining 49% of the
joint venture and would have to pay Feldmuhle an equivalent
price for that stake.

   The joint venture is subject to approval by the German
Federal Cartel Office and both company's boards. Scott said
it expects the joint venture to be formed in the fourth

   Feldmuhle markets sanitary-tissue products in Europe and
manufactures tissue products in Germany and in the
Netherlands. The company had gross sales of about $300
million in 1989; Scott had European sales of about $1.2
billion in 1989.

   DONALD TRUMP'S debt includes more than $500 million in
bank loans that he personally guaranteed, bankers say.
Lenders are increasingly seeking the liquidation of most of
his properties, and demanding that he relinquish day-to-day
control of his operations. The market value of his assets is
believed to fall well short of the amount the developer has
borrowed. Trump missed $73 million in debt payments that were

   Control of Major Airports by Carriers
   Is Focus of Justice Department Inquiry

   The Justice Department is investigating one of the most
controversial offshoots of airline deregulation -- the
domination of major airports by one or two large airlines.
   A department spokesman confirmed that the agency is in the
preliminary stages of a broad inquiry into possible antitrust
violations in these markets. As an initial step in the probe,
federal prosecutors asked USAir Inc. to supply information
about how gates will be allocated at a new terminal at
Greater Pittsburgh International Airport.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A Justice Department spokesman said the agency wants,
among other things, to find out if arrangements between the
airport and USAir could make it harder for other airlines to
start service in Pittsburgh. The unit of Arlington, Va.-based
USAir Group Inc. already controls 81% of the market in
Pittsburgh, measured by the number of passengers carried.
Including its commuter airline affiliate, USAir has an 87%
market share. USAir denies any wrongdoing.
   The USAir investigation, first reported last Friday by the
Pittsburgh Post Gazette, is part of a broader federal probe,
said Joseph Krovisky, a Justice Department spokesman. He
declined to identify the other airlines or airports under
scrutiny. A number of major carriers, including NWA Inc.'s
Northwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc. and UAL Corp.'s
United Airlines, said they hadn't been contacted by the
Justice Department in connection with this investigation.
   The trend toward the building of "fortress hubs" by major
carriers has been a controversial one in recent years. The
wave of airline mergers in the 1980s left some airports with
little open competition. In cities like Pittsburgh,
Minneapolis, Detroit and St. Louis, a single carrier now
controls nearly all the business. At others, only two
airlines share most of the business.
   A study by the General Accounting Office, Congress's
investigative arm, found that ticket prices at these airports
have risen faster than elsewhere. The average one-way fare
between Pittsburgh and New York, for instance, has risen 70%
to $90.28 in 1988 from $52.98 in 1984.
   The USAir investigation, which is "in the preliminary
stages," is separate from a continuing Justice Department
probe of possible ticket price-fixing by major airlines, the
spokesman said. The price-fixing investigation targets AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines, among other carriers, although the
Justice Department has never formally confirmed which
companies are under scrutiny.
   "Justice Department has turned up the heat," said William
E. Kovacic, a former antitrust attorney at the Federal Trade
Commission. "We've seen the {amount of} activity pick up."
   The agency's concern about market domination at certain
airports dates back to the mid-1980s when it opposed big
mergers such as Trans World Airlines -- Northwest-Republic.
But the Transportation Department, which had final authority
over the mergers, approved the transactions. At the time,
airlines and officials of the Transportation Department
reasoned that competition between airports was a more
important consideration than what would happen in individual
markets. They also decided that the threat of new competition
would force carriers to hold down fares in their home
markets.
   But now there is concern about whether or not carriers are
taking steps to keep new competitors off their turf. For
instance, the agreements under investigation in Pittsburgh
would allow USAir to control 50 of the 75 gates at the new
terminal. This "may limit the entry of new competitors into
the Pittsburgh market," in violation of federal prohibitions
on restraint of trade and attempted monopolization, the
Justice Department spokesman said.
   The issue of market domination also was raised last year,
when the Justice Department threatened to file a civil
lawsuit to block the sale of Philadelphia gates and other
assets owned by Eastern Air Lines Inc., a unit of Continental
Airlines Holding Inc., to USAir, which is the largest carrier
in Philadelphia. Midway Airlines Inc., a new entrant in the
market, got the okay instead. Two years ago, the Justice
Department asked United Airlines for information about the
control of takeoff and landing slots at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport. In that case, which is still under
review, the agency is concerned that the way slots are
acquired could restrict competition.
   The latest investigation came to light when USAir
disclosed it in documents related to the issuance of about
$85 million in revenue bonds for the Pittsburgh airport
expansion.
   The Justice Department has sent USAir formal requests for
documents on its activities at the Pittsburgh airport. The
requests, known as civil investigatory demands, are the civil
equivalent of criminal subpoenas. They ask for a broad range
of documents and data related to possible antitrust
violations.
   "Nobody has accused USAir of anything," says a spokesman
for the carrier. The airline says it believes its agreements
with airport authorities won't prevent increased competition
at Pittsburgh and aren't designed to do so.
   Herb Hovenkamp, an antitrust attorney at the University of
Iowa, considers the Justice Department's series of
investigations into the airline industry "a silent
recognition that one important aspect of the Reagan era's
antitrust policy didn't work very well."
   "I think they believe that the error of indulgence toward
mergers was most serious toward the airline industry," says
Mr. Hovenkamp.
   The Justice Department's investigation of major airport
dominance by one or two big carriers reflects the Bush
administration's stepped-up concern about antitrust
enforcement, especially in the airline industry. In contrast,
the Reagan administration took a generally lenient approach
toward mergers among rivals and allowed three major airline
combinations, which significantly increased the market power
of the surviving carriers.
   Although he hasn't blocked any notable mergers, President
Bush's chief antitrust enforcer, James Rill, has talked tough
about increased federal scrutiny. He has launched
investigations in a number of industries, including airlines,
health-care and higher education, reminding corporate America
that the antitrust laws aren't dead.
   Mr. Rill, an assistant attorney general, has indicated
personal concern about single-carrier domination at key
airports resulting in higher ticket prices. During a recent
interview, he pointed out that an internal Justice Department
"discussion paper" had concluded that two recent airline
mergers had resulted in higher prices at major airports.
   Specifically, the document concluded that the merger of
TWA and Ozark "appears to have caused a slight increase in
fares and a far greater reduction in service" out of the St.
Louis airport. The paper also concluded that the merger of
Northwest and Republic "appears to have caused a significant
increase in fares and a significant reduction in overall
service" out of the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport.

   American Healthcare Management Inc., which emerged from
bankruptcy-law proceedings less than six months ago, said it
retained First Boston Corp. to evaluate additional capital
restructuring alternatives.
   Chief Executive Steven L. Volla, in a news release, said
the Dallas health-care firm's reorganization plan was based
on overly optimistic assumptions. The release noted that
further restructuring is needed to reduce the financial risk
of the current "highly leveraged capital structure."

   Company officials didn't return phone calls seeking
further explanation.
   American Healthcare, which owns or leases 17 hospitals in
10 states, sought protection from creditors in August 1987.
It completed its reorganization at the end of 1989 by issuing
15.2 million new shares of common stock to creditors and
shareholders and by issuing new debt.

   Chrysler Financial Corp. -- $300 million of 10.30% notes,
due June 15, 1992, priced at 99.939 to yield 10.33%. The
notes were priced at a spread of 200 basis points above the
Treasury's two-year note. Rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors
Service Inc. and triple-B-minus by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.,
the issue will be sold through First Boston Corp. The
Chrysler Financial issue offers bondholder protection in the
form of event-risk language. Investors can put the notes back
to the company at the offering price if the company's debt
ratings falls below investment-grade while Moody's has
Chrysler's debt on its watch list. Earlier this week, Moody's
said it is reviewing the ratings of $22.28 billion of
Chrysler debt for possible downgrade. The sale of debt Friday
comes after Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. late Thursday downgraded
certain debt ratings of parent Chrysler Corp. and Chrysler
Financial. Corp.
   Illinois Tool Works -- $275 million of zero-coupon

Canada, eliminating 200 jobs, some of them seasonal.
   Sunbeam will close its Solaray facility at Brantford,
Ontario, by mid-December, ending production of electric and
non-electric blankets, heating pads and humidification
products. Sales, marketing and other administrative functions
currently performed at Brantford will be consolidated with
Sunbeam's Toronto operation.

   In addition, Sunbeam will end production of gas barbecue
grills and lawnmowers at its Toronto facility, effective
immediately.
   Sunbeam said it will continue to sell a full line of
products in Canada, most of them manufactured in the
company's U.S. plants. Sunbeam Canada will employ about 160
people after the cutbacks.
   Allegheny is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.

   Machines Are Step Toward
   Merging Apollo Line

   PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co., struggling to
quiet critics of its purchase last year of Apollo Computer
Inc., today is to introduce its first computer workstations
that combine product lines from both brands.
   H-P is unifying only one segment of its H-P and Apollo
workstation families -- the machines based on microprocessors
from Motorola Inc. H-P will still market its own and Apollo
computers that are based on other, dissimilar
microprocessors, and that use different operating systems,
the software that controls a machine's basic functions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   H-P's new workstations are based on Motorola's new 68040
microprocessor. The 68040 workstation starts at $8,990 and
will be available in late summer. H-P also is releasing a
$4,990 machine based on Motorola's 68030 chip, but buyers
will be able to swap their processors for the more powerful
68040. The introduction of the 68040 model was delayed
because the Motorola chip hasn't been available, H-P said.
Both models, which come equipped with various options, are
aimed more at demonstrating the seriousness of H-P's vow to
streamline its workstation offerings than at any one
particular competitor.
   How quickly H-P merges the two different workstation lines
is a critical factor in whether the $476.4 million
acquisition, which vaulted H-P to the top of the roughly $7
billion workstation market, is considered a success. Already,
in the 13 months since buying Apollo, confusion over the
company's direction in workstations and pressure from
competitors have proven costly.
   H-P's executives acknowledge problems in coming to grips
with Apollo's operations, but they vigorously defend the
purchase. Many observers, however, are pessimistic, noting
that the strength of Apollo, which helped forge the
workstation market in the early 1980s, had begun to wane even
before the purchase. "The whole Apollo acquisition has turned
out to be quicksand," said Peter Rogers, an analyst at
Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.
   H-P concedes that workstation sales are below its
expectations this year, and that Sun Microsystems Inc., which
H-P displaced from the top spot last year, is again the
market's frontrunner. Workstations are generally used by
engineers and scientists for a variety of everyday tasks, and
in recent years have become essential tools in the design of
everything from semiconductors to airplanes.
   Observers say Sun is gaining momentum, putting last year's
operational troubles behind it and recently introducing an
under-$5,000 version of its best-selling Sparcstation model.
   "Sun is clearly considered to be a more aggressive
marketing company, a win-the-big-deals company," said Thomas
Bruggere, chief executive officer of Mentor Graphics Corp.,
which last week agreed to purchase $300 million of Sun
computers over the next three years. Before the deal, Mentor
was virtually wedded to Apollo workstations.
   Strong new products by other competitors also have
squeezed H-P. Earlier this year, International Business
Machines Corp. introduced a slew of aggressively priced
workstations, re-entering the market after years on the
sidelines. Digital Equipment Corp., which like Sun and H-P
has more than 20% of the workstation market, also introduced
new models recently.
   The stream of competitive products isn't likely to slow
because the workstation industry is very much a game of
technical leapfrog. Analysts say H-P could trail in the race
for some time. "Until it has a single, coherent workstation
family, H-P is going to find things increasingly difficult,"
Mr. Rogers said.
   H-P executives insist that its new workstations, to be
unveiled in Boston, are the first in a series of moves by the
company aimed at reversing its slide in this market. "We have
not abandoned the idea of being the No. 1 workstation
vendor," said Lew Platt, who runs H-P's computer products
sector, which includes the company's workstation group. "We
can certainly regain that position."
   David Wu, an analyst at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co., agrees. "While
everyone complained about the costs {of the purchase}, the
benefits are substantial," Mr. Wu said. "Now if Sun ever
stumbles, {H-P has} a shot at No. 1."
   Mr. Platt believes the new workstations will put some heat
on Sun and testify to its ability to meld Apollo's
workstation family with its own diverse offerings. Both H-P
and Apollo have workstation lines that are based on
Motorola's chip, and William Kay, general manager of H-P's
workstation group, said this was a natural place to start
blending the product lines.
   But analysts questioned H-P's willingness to heavily
support the 68040, Motorola's most advanced chip, at a time
when many customers are choosing workstations that contain
reduced-instruction-set-computing chips at their heart.
Workstation users are notoriously power-hungry, and the
so-called Risc chips outperform Motorola's microprocessors on
most measures.
   "They are going against the trend by continuing to push
Motorola," said Jay Prakash, an analyst at Strategic Focus
Inc., a Milpitas, Calif., company that tracks workstation
trends. "The industry is moving to Risc." H-P has its own
Risc workstations, as does Apollo, but Mr. Platt admits that
in bringing Apollo into the fold, H-P neglected important
work in providing new Risc machines.
   H-P also must blend two different software operating
systems. The machines announced today use either Apollo's or
H-P's operating system, but customers want a single operating
system that covers every workstation sold by H-P. "They're
working on it," said Mr. Bruggere. "The question is how soon
they'll get there."
   Mr. Kay, H-P's workstation chief, said the company planned
to support two different Risc families through 1992. Analysts
expect H-P to support multiple operating systems at least
until then as well. "That's very expensive to do," said Mr.
Prakash.

   SEC, Congressional Panel Investigate
   `Roll-Ups' to Check Fairness to Investors

   The Securities and Exchange Commission and a congressional
subcommittee are looking into reorganizations of public
limited-partnerships called "roll-ups" to see if they are
fair to investors.
   The SEC said it initiated a staff inquiry after receiving
complaints from some limited partners involved in the
reorganizations earlier this year. An SEC spokeswoman
wouldn't discuss details of the inquiry and said the agency
won't make the results public.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Edward J. Markey (D. Mass.), chairman of the House
Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, told SEC
Chairman Richard C. Breeden this past week, however, that the
subcommittee will conduct hearings on roll-ups next month.
The subcommittee, which deals with securities issues, has
asked the SEC for answers by July 13 to an extensive list of
questions the agency has about the reorganizations.
   Roll-ups already in progress or planned by syndicators
will affect an estimated 146,000 investors who put about $1.2
billion into limited partnerships, Rep. Markey said in a
letter to Mr. Breeden. "The subcommittee is generally
concerned that individual investors haven't been well-served
by such reorganizations in the past and that regulatory or
legislative changes may be necessary to assure that limited
partners are treated fairly in future roll-ups."
   In a roll-up, several non-traded limited partnerships --
typically including some healthy ones and some that aren't --
are consolidated into new, publicly traded investments.
Limited partners usually approve the reorganization to gain
liquidity.
   But often, the supposed exchange value of their interests
is far below the price the market puts on the new units when
they begin trading. Most roll-ups so far have involved real
estate partnerships or those that invested in oil and gas.
   Many analysts expect a wave of the reorganizations because
of the large number of syndicators that are financially
troubled. A roll-up effectively transforms limited
partnerships, which have a finite life of about 10 years,
into an open-ended investment that continues to generate
management fees for the general partner.
   The subcommittee has asked the SEC for ways to mitigate
such conflicts of interest, suggesting that establishing an
independent board of trustees might be one remedy. The panel
has also requested that the agency evaluate whether the SEC's
current disclosure rules on roll-ups and the legal remedies
available to investors are adequate.

   Colorado Passes
   Regulation to Fight
   Penny-Stock Fraud

   The war on penny-stock fraud is heating up in several
states, and the latest shot has been fired by Colorado, a
hotbed of penny-stock trading since the turn of the century.
   Colorado passed a law this month that will vault the
state's notably lax securities regulation "into the
mainstream," says Philip Feigin, the state's securities
commissioner. In cracking down, Colorado follows the path
taken in recent years by a number of former penny-stock
havens including New Jersey, Utah and Florida.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Everybody knew the Denver penny-stock game was nothing
more than gambling," says William McDonald, chief of
enforcement for the California Department of Corporations.
"It was anarchy out there for a long time. So was Utah. Both
of them have improved."
   The states aren't waiting for lawmakers in Washington to
pass a recently proposed bill that would strengthen federal
policing of penny stocks. They have already joined forces
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to chase
after scams in low-priced stocks.
   Penny-stock fraud generally involves shares that sell for
$1 or less.
   And there are signs that penny-stock abuse may be abating,
says Joseph Goldstein, chairman of a two-year-old SEC task
force on the matter. For the six months through March, the
SEC received 1,075 complaints of penny-stock fraud. That pace
puts it well behind fiscal 1989, when a total of 3,776 such
complaints were filed.
   Some regulators, however, are skeptical, expressing doubt
that deceptive salesmen of cheap shares will abandon their
lucrative swindles for long.
   "Some penny-stock firms are going away," says Deborah
Bortner, assistant securities administrator for Washington
state. "But for a lot of these people, it's the only way they
know how to make a living. They may be gone shortly, but
they'll figure out a way to get back." Penny-stock fraud
costs investors in the U.S. an estimated $2 billion a year,
according to the North American Securities Administrators
Association, a group of U.S. state and Canadian regulators.
   Colorado's new law, modeled on a measure Utah adopted in
1986, takes aim at "blind pools" in which investors put up
money to buy stock in a company without any definite business
purpose. Colorado now requires that money invested in a blind
pool remain in escrow until a business plan is adopted and
the state securities commissioner is notified.
   In Utah, the tactic helped slash the number of blind pools
to just five (raising $500,000) in 1988, compared with 217
(raising $19.8 million) five years earlier, according to the
North American regulators' group.
   Nationwide, about 70% of all new penny-stock offerings in
recent years have been blind pools, the group says. Promoters
typically raised $50,000 to $200,000 at a time by selling
millions of shares of stock, for pennies a share, in
businesses that generally had no assets, no employees and no
written business plan.
   Colorado's new legislation requires that all securities
offerings be registered with the state, creates licensing
requirements for broker-dealers and sales agents, and beefs
up state enforcement powers. Although the new measures are
aimed at restoring investor confidence in Colorado offerings,
they don't have quite the teeth that other state laws do, Mr.
Feigin says. "We'll see how that works."
   Colorado's penny-stock operators already are "treading
water," says Frank Birgfeld, director of the National
Association of Securities Dealers' Denver office. He ties a
slowdown in low-priced share promotions to the 1987 stock
market collapse, greater public awareness of stock fraud and
a new federal rule making it tougher for brokers to take
advantage of first-time customers.
   In Washington, the SEC's Mr. Goldstein says shady dealers
have been pressured by the SEC's "cold-call" rule, which took
effect Jan. 1. Designed to protect unsophisticated investors
from high-pressure telephone sales tactics, the rule requires
brokers to determine whether an investment in penny stocks is
financially suitable for first-time customers.
   California's Mr. McDonald says the regulation has been
largely responsible for cutting to six from 22 the number of
penny-stock brokers in that state.
   Mr. Goldstein also praises heightened public-awareness
campaigns and tougher policing by state regulators. In a
joint effort with the SEC, Florida has become a model for
apparently successful crackdowns coordinated with federal
authorities.
   More than one million brochures warning investors about
abuses by investment dealers were mailed to Floridians with
their utility bills, banking statements and corporate and
state employer letters, Mr. Goldstein says. Titled "Don't Be
a Victim of Penny Stock Fraud" and printed in English and
Spanish, the brochures describe frequently used high-pressure
sales tactics, risks involved in trading penny stocks and how
to file complaints. A toll-free advice number is provided.
   Florida, after more than doubling its enforcement staff,
in 1988 put 70 examiners, attorneys and investigators to work
full time on penny-stock abuse, says Florida Deputy
Comptroller Larry Fuchs. Complaints are beginning to decline,
he says. Since Jan. 1, 10% of all complaints received by his
office involved penny-stock investments, down from 31% in the
first half of 1989. Since January 1988, the state has revoked
the licenses of 3,800 of Florida's 142,000 registered
securities agents, he says.
   Georgia and Southern California inherited a number of the
illegal dealers who fled Florida, Mr. Fuchs says. Georgia
recently passed legislation to fight the proliferation of
abuse there. California regulators are struggling to keep up
with a growing number of "boiler-room" salesmen of
commodities and other investment vehicles, rather than
penny-stocks, says Mr. McDonald.
   To avoid U.S. regulators, some penny-stock operators are
moving their operations offshore to Latin America and Pacific
island countries, some regulators say. "We can't get bank
records in those places," says Washington state's Ms.
Bortner.
   Also on the rise: a phenomenon in which broker-dealers who
have lost their licenses (or others who want to evade
licensing requirements) suddenly surface in branch offices of
licensed firms. They identify themselves as financial
consultants or account executives, aggressively tout penny
stocks and reap large profits for the branch office.
   "That's the coming way out of getting out of registering
as broker-dealers," Ms. Bortner says. "They are popping up as
owner-operators of branch offices."
   Crooks will remain elusive as long as their profits
outweigh the penalties and settlements they may have to pay,
she says. "I've seen agents with $30,000, $40,000 settlements
-- four or five of them" -- who are still active, she says.
"Even though some of them may be slightly sleazy, they have a
pretty easy time of keeping jobs" if they produce big
profits.
   Restricting blind pools at the federal level might further
curtail the penny-stock market, suggests Ms. Bortner, who is
vice chairwoman of a committee on penny-stock telemarketing
for the North American securities group. The reason: Blind
pools still can register in states with lax laws. Limits on
blind pools are part of a federal bill introduced in April by
Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of a House Finance
subcommittee.

   Southeast Banking Slashes Its Dividend,
   Expects to Post Losses for Quarter, Year

   Southeast Banking Corp. slashed its dividend, announced
asset sales, boosted loan-loss reserves and said it expects
to post losses for the second quarter and year, all
reflecting the worsening condition of the South Florida real
estate market.
   As recently as March 23, Charles J. Zwick, chairman and
chief executive officer of Miami-based Southeast, said the
bank holding company would be profitable this year, and many
banking analysts had expected Southeast to turn a modest
profit in the second quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Friday, the company disclosed that the credit quality
of its large South Florida loan portfolio is much lower than
previously believed.
   The bleak outlook sent Southeast stock tumbling Friday to
$11, down $2.375, in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.
   Southeast said it would take several steps to shore up its
balance sheet. First, the company slashed its quarterly
dividend by 64%, to 10 cents a share from 28 cents a share.
The dividend is payable July 17 to shares of record June 25.
The last time Southeast cut its dividend was 1976.
   Second, the company said it reached a preliminary
agreement to sell certain assets of its mortgage subsidiary
to Sears Mortgage Corp., a unit of Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. The
transaction, if completed, would include Southeast's
residental mortgage servicing portfolio, a number of branch
offices of the mortgage unit and other assets and would
result in a payment to Southeast of as much as $100 million,
the firm said.
   Southeast said it is looking for other "significant cost
savings," including the possibility of deferring some capital
projects.
   Third, Southeast said it is adding between $2 million and
$22 million to its loan-loss reserve, raising its total
provision for bad loans to a projected $260 million to $280
million by June 30 from $258 million March 31. The increase
reflects a surge in nonperforming assets. The company said it
expects its total nonperforming loans to range between $600
million and $620 million by June 30, up at least 26% since
March 31.
   Loan-loss reserves are a fund that banks set aside to
offset expected losses from bad loans. Nonperforming assets
are loans that have been foreclosed upon or are more than 90
days past due.
   Southeast didn't elaborate on its projected results for
the second quarter or year except to say that neither period
will be profitable. In the 1989 second quarter, Southeast had
net income of $32.3 million, or $1 a share. For all of 1989,
it had net of $80.5 million, or $2.42 a share.
   "The condition of Florida's economy has not improved and
continues to adversely affect the loan porfolio," Mr. Zwick
said. But, he said, "The situation now is better than it was
in the mid-'70s," the time of the last severe slump in
Florida real estate.
   Cheryl Swaim, a banking analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.,
said Southeast's loan portfolio is deteriorating faster than
she expected. In addition to the Florida real estate
problems, she said, Southeast added a $55 million leveraged
buy-out loan to its nonperforming category in the second
quarter. Before Friday, Ms. Swaim projected Southeast would
earn between 25 cents and 30 cents a share in the second
quarter and at least break even in 1990.
   Mr. Zwick confirmed that Southeast added an LBO loan to
its nonperforming list in the period, but he wouldn't
elaborate on the size of the loan or provide any other
details. He said 70% to 75% of Southeast's nonperforming
assets are from real estate loans, with the rest from
commercial credit.
   John J. Mason, a banking analyst with Interstate/Johnson
Lane, said he expects Southeast to record a roughly $50
million capital gain from the sale of its residential
mortgage unit, compared with the gross price of as much as
$100 million that Southeast said it should receive for the
assets. The difference reflects Southeast's hefty investment
in acquiring the mortgage subsidiary, said Mr. Mason. "They
paid real money for that company," he said.
   Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered
its senior debt ratings for Southeast as well as the
company's commercial paper rating. The rating service also
said it downgraded the ratings of long-term and short-term
deposits of the company's Southeast Bank N.A. unit.
   The changes affect about $375 million of debt.

   Marketing-Minded Child-Care Centers
   Become More Than 9-to-5 Baby Sitters

   Many child-care centers are becoming surrogate extended
families to increase their appeal to a generation of harried
working parents.
   At some facilities, parents now can get child-care any
time of the day or night, whether they work odd hours or are
simply going to see a show. Some offer gym and swimming
classes, and transportation to baseball and soccer games.
Others let parents buy prepared meals to take home and reheat
for dinner. Even some centers serving low-income families are
taking a broader view of their role by arranging for a doctor
to visit weekly or providing immunization shots to children.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To go with their new flexibility and novel services,
innovators in the child-care field also have developed
sophisticated marketing strategies, keeping their eye on the
bottom line. Indeed, many of the more elaborate child-care
centers are actually making money in an industry with tight
profit margins. Their primary targets are affluent,
two-income families and corporations looking for ways to ease
family pressures. Many corporations, which often don't want
the hassles of operating an on-site child-care center, prefer
to subsidize spaces for employees' children nearby.
   "The child-care business is professionalizing and doing
what other market-oriented businesses do -- satisfying the
needs of its customers," says Michael Connelly, president of
Lepercq Capital Management Inc., the venture capital unit of
Lepercq, deNeuflize &amp; Co., a New York investment banking
firm.
   Lepercq Capital has been investing in "high-end child
care." A company launched by Lepercq two years ago already
operates 12 child-care centers in Pennsylvania and New
Jersey, with three more set to open this fall, and plans for
more elsewhere. Lepercq recently invested $600,000 to acquire
a 20% stake in Sunrise Preschools Inc., which provides care
for about 3,600 children in 12 facilities in the Phoenix,
Ariz., area, and two in Hawaii.
   Lepercq says it was led to Sunrise by a reputation for
quality and its pioneering programs. Consider the options:
Sunrise offers round-the-clock care for working parents with
late night, overnight and weekend schedules. It sets up
satellite facilities at the Phoenix civic center and area
resort hotels to provide care for the children of
conventioneers and vacationers. The Phoenix Symphony and
Herberger Theatre have tie-ins with Sunrise so parents can
make a child-care reservation when they order their tickets.
   "The type of parent we serve needs a lot of attention,"
says Buffy Owens, executive vice president of Sunrise, where
40% of the families enrolled have annual incomes exceeding
$50,000 and another 20% have annual incomes of $35,000 to
$45,000. "They earn more, they're having fewer children per
household than ever before, they're having children much
later in life and have more disposable income, so they're
looking for a place that can take care of both the parents'
and the child's needs."
   In Chicago, the Lakeshore Teaching &amp; Learning Center aims
to do the same. Its "flex" programs offer "clients" the
option of two to five days a week divided into any
combination of half days, three-quarter days or full days.
The center's parents, more than half of whom are
professionals with combined incomes of more than $50,000,
include diplomats and politicians.
   Richard Levin, president of the Lakeshore center, uses
advertising and public relations skills acquired in a past
career to market the nine-year-old center, which boasts 99%
occupancy with 350 children aged five months and up, even
though the $135 weekly rate is the area's priciest.
   To promote his center, Mr. Levin contracts with an outside
public relations consultant, publishes quarterly newsletters,
and holds constant tours of the center. One of the local
television stations shot background for "Year of the Child"
public service announcements at the center. "Every time you
turned around, there we were" on television," says Mr. Levin.
He also uses direct mail, and recently bought a list of
several thousand names targeted to affluent local ZIP codes
within 10 to 20 minutes of the center.
   Of course, many child-care centers prefer the traditional
path. Flexible hours can be an administrative nightmare. And
some believe that other programs divert attention from the
basic tasks of quality care and education. But there are
increasing numbers of parents and employers who need more
than that, and apparently are willing to pay for it.
   Though Mr. Levin says quality care for the children is
more important than the bottom line, "we can't be in business
unless we make a profit."
   At Sunrise, tuition runs from $84 to $130 a week, which
puts it at the high-end of the local market. But up to 30% of
its enrollment is subsidized by employers. Annamarie
Jennings, an attorney with the city of Phoenix, has two
children enrolled in a Sunrise center. Like other city and
county employees, she gets a 25% discount under a $356,000
three-year contract the city and county negotiated with
Sunrise to reserve spaces for 150 children who use it full
and part time.
   Cheryl Walsh and her husband, Jeff, both attorneys with
the law firm of Snell &amp; Wilmer, pay $86.40 a week for child
care for their two-year-old daughter, Keely, because of a 10%
discount negotiated by their employer. Their Sunrise facility
is just three blocks from their Phoenix office, and comes in
handy for weekend and evening care when they have to work
overtime.
   Sunrise says it has gone out of its way to cater to
corporate needs, and its roster also includes McDonnell
Douglas's helicopter subsidiary, the U.S. Postal Service and
several hospitals. To accommodate America West Airlines Inc.
flight attendants, baggage handlers and other employees with
diverse work schedules, Sunrise agreed to run a 24-hour,
seven-day-a week facility. It also created a new rate
schedule for part-time, three-quarters time and full-time
care. The airline subsidizes up to 50% of the weekly tuition.
   "Child care up to now has pretty much been held hostage by
the attitude that people in child care give of themselves and
that everybody must be the Mother Theresa type," says David
Pierson, editor of Child Care Review, a bimonthly journal for
managers of child-care centers. "The fact is that there
aren't that many saints on the face of the Earth. They've got
to figure out a way that a buck can be made."

   Saab-Scania AB said Friday its pretax profit in the first
four months surged 27% to 817 million kronor ($133.9 million)
from 642 million kronor in the corresponding period a year
ago.
   The Swedish aerospace and automotive group said
consolidated sales rose by 11% to 10.2 billion kronor from
9.2 billion. Consolidated income before appropriations and
taxes was 2.52 billion kronor, compared with 642 million in
the first four months last year. The increase reflects 1.7
billion kronor from the sale of 50% of Saab's profit-losing
car operations to General Motors Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Saab's pretax profit in the first four months was about
130 million kronor above the 690-million-krona average
predicted by analysts.
   Among business areas, Saab Aircraft reported a 74% surge
in sales to 1.65 billion kronor from 951 million, propelled
by the success of its turboprop commuter planes, Saab 340 and
Saab 2000.
   The car division, Saab Automobile, owned jointly by Saab
and GM, which started operations Jan. 1, reported a
995-million-krona loss in the first four months.

   First Commerce Corp. said its nonperforming assets have
increased $14 million since March 31 and are $6 million
higher than it reported at the end of the second quarter of
1989. The primary reason, it said, is the placement on
nonaccrual status of several credits at the New Orleans bank.
   Nonperforming assets now total about $79 million, or 3.4%
of all loans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company's provision for loan losses is expected to be
about $12 million for the second quarter, compared with $8
million in the first quarter and $6 million in the
year-earlier period. Because of weaknesses in the loan
portfolio, bank officials said, second-quarter earnings are
expected to fall in a range of 35 to 40 cents a share,
compared with 62 cents a share in the first quarter and 58
cents a share a year earlier.

   Manpower PLC said that pretax profit for the six months to

its non-Manpower brand operations, which were sold June 4.
   The London-based company, an employment and financial

because of insufficient distributable reserves. Last year, it
declared an interim dividend of 0.6 penny a share.

   Pretax profit for the six-month period was #21.3 million
($36.4 million), down 14% from year-earlier profit of #24.8

million a year earlier. Per-share earnings eased 18% to 1.8
pennies a share from 2.2 pennies.
   Analysts said the results were slightly worse than
expected, with the average forecast for around #23.5 million
pretax profit.
   Manpower's share price rose 1 penny to 88 pennies on the
results, before easing to 87 1/2 around midday Friday on the

   Hardening of Positions in Middle East
   Points to Trouble Ahead for Washington

   WASHINGTON -- All the trend lines in the Middle East
suddenly point toward trouble for President Bush.
   Public attention has been focused on the souring of U.S.
relations with both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
The formation of a right-wing Israeli government clearly has
complicated the Bush administration's peace efforts. At the
same time, Mr. Bush is considering whether to suspend the
American dialogue with the Palestinian Liberation
Organization because of the role a PLO group played in a
seaborne attack on Israel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But those events are just pieces of a broader, more
troubling mosaic of new problems in the region that are
deeply worrying Bush administration policymakers.
Specifically:
   -- Once-moderate Jordan is moving more and more into the
orbit of Iraq and its hardline leader, Saddam Hussein.
Jordan's King Hussein is spouting anti-American, anti-Israeli
rhetoric; he has allowed his air force to conduct joint
military maneuvers with Iraq and is warning of dire
consequences if Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel push
Palestinians out of Israeli-occupied territories and into
Jordan.
   -- PLO leader Yasser Arafat also seems to be drifting
closer to Iraq. That means Mr. Arafat is sliding away from
Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, who has been a moderating influence on
the PLO chief for the last few years.
   -- The rise of an increasingly belligerent Iraq and the
drift of Jordan and the PLO toward it have left Egypt,
America's best friend in the Arab world, more isolated and
less effective.
   -- All this is occurring against a backdrop of
proliferation of dangerous arms in the region, particularly
long-range missiles and chemical weapons. There is "a sense
of the Middle East on edge," says one of the administration's
top Middle East policy-makers.
   Richard Murphy, formerly the head of the State
Department's Middle East bureau, says the situation is
particularly troubling because it is developing at a time
when there is an Arab perception that a war government has
just been brought to power in Israel. "I guess my concern is
of accidents happening because there is no or very little
peace process to point to," he says.
   Of course, these dangerous trends are offset in part by
the decline in U.S.-Soviet animosity, which removes a source
of tension that long contributed to fears of war in the
Middle East. With the Soviet Union beset by its own problems,
it no longer seems plausible that Moscow might seek to alter
the superpower balance of power by prodding its friends in
Iraq and Syria to seek a fight with Israel, America's closest
friend in the region.
   But new forces, many of them beyond President Bush's
control, could lead to hostilities. Iraq seems to have grown
more bellicose toward Israel in recent months, in part out of
genuine fear that Israel is contemplating some kind of
pre-emptive military strike at Iraq's missile and
chemical-arms installations. Those Iraqi fears will only grow
as a result of the formation of Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's new government.
   The Israelis, in turn, already are edgy because of the
signs of increased military cooperation between Iraq and
Jordan. Israel was particularly troubled by an incident last
year in which Jordanian and Iraqi jets flew a joint training
mission near Israeli territory. King Hussein, his kingdom in
bad economic shape, may see little choice now but to
cooperate more with oil-rich Iraq in hopes of winning both
its protection and its economic aid.
   The increased flow of Soviet Jews into Israel is
exacerbating Arab-Israeli tensions across the board. King
Hussein, in particular, worries that the new Israeli
government is likely to funnel thousands of the Soviet
emigres into the Israeli-occupied West Bank, prodding
Palestinians there to head into neighboring Jordan. There,
they might disrupt the king's regime.
   Adding to this volatile mix is the prospect that the
long-running uprising among Palestinians in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip may grow in intensity if Palestinian anger is
stoked by an American decision to cut off its dialogue with
the PLO.
   The danger for President Bush is that some spark could set
off this volatile mixture, creating an explosion that draws
in the U.S., says Judith Kipper, a Middle East analyst at the
Brookings Institution, adding that rather than simply wait
for peace agreements, the U.S. and the Soviet Union ought to
move jointly to put in place a "regional security structure"
to prevent a blowup.
   For their part, President Bush's aides insist they don't
intend to retreat from the region simply because trends are
bad; they argue that American involvement is more important
than ever at such times. But the dangers are arising at a
time when the chief American tool to prevent a blowup -- a
peace process that holds out some hope of resolving the
Palestinian problem -- is dead in the water.

   Bellyaching Advertisers Stomach
   New Audience-Guarantee Plans

   Advertisers screamed when all three major television
networks scrapped the traditional practice of guaranteeing
audience sizes last week. Sponsors threatened to take their
advertising dollars elsewhere, to place ads on -- perish the
thought -- upstart rivals such as Fox.
   But the temper tantrums appear to be almost pure
posturing. When the upfront market, during which advertisers
pull out their wallets and start negotiating to buy ad time
for the upcoming fall season, kicks off this week, ad agency
executives concede it will be business as usual. Advertisers
are expected to spend $4.4 billion or more on prime time on
the three networks and Fox, up from $4.2 billion a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There's a certain amount of money out there that's been
slated to buy {network television}, and that's going to get
spent. It's still the best medium for advertisers to look
at," says Jennifer Young, a senior vice president with Della
Femina McNamee. Once upfront sales start, "the market will
move as if pretty much nothing went on, despite all our
bellyaching."
   The change in the guarantee system, agrees Paul Schulman
president of Paul Schulman Co., a media buying firm, "won't
affect the upfront very much at all. It's just one more
factor in the total upfront equation." Some advertisers may
channel a tiny piece of their budgets away from network
television just to slap the networks' wrists, industry
executives say, but that amount will be barely noticeable in
the multibillion-dollar pie.
   Late last week, all three networks agreed to use a plan
formulated by NBC which does away with the traditional
guarantee system. Under the plan, the networks will project
audience size for the fall TV season by using an average of
audience levels over the past eight years. The networks will
guarantee audience sizes based on those projections, rather
than based solely on ratings from A.C. Nielsen Co., as they
have in the past. The reason behind the change: Nielsen
ratings showed a steep, unexplained drop earlier this year, a
drop that cost the networks dearly.
   Until now, the networks guaranteed advertisers certain TV
ratings as measured by Nielsen. If the actual ratings fell
short, the networks would have to cough up free commercial
air time to the advertisers, known as "make goods." The three
networks just this year have had to shell out as much as $200
million of make goods after the disastrous, mysterious
ratings decline. With the new plan, they are trying to avoid
another such trouncing.
   Advertisers immediately denounced the plan; they still
don't support it, but now say they will treat it as just
another issue at the negotiating table. "Certainly, anything
you give away you try to get back somewhere else," says Mr.
Schulman. He and others say that advertisers will attempt to
hold out for slightly lower prices, a better programming mix,
or other extras in return for the reduced guarantee.
   Advertisers may also attempt to stick to the traditional
guarantee system, if they have enough leverage to twist the
networks' arms. "Every deal may be slightly different,"
predicts Marc Goldstein, director of national broadcast for
Lintas.
   With the audience-guarantee issue moving to a back burner,
advertisers and networks alike are now trying to fathom who
the big winners will be in the upfront market. Advertisers
say Capital Cities/ABC's network, the second-ranked network
that has been gaining on No. 1 NBC, is looking for the
biggest price increases, ranging from 17% to 20% for the
desirable 18- to 39-year-old age group. Although ABC is
unlikely to get increases that big, advertisers say it may
well win double-digit rises.
   NBC, a unit of General Electric, is expected to win
smaller increases. Its stable of hits is seen as aging and
vulnerable. And CBS could eke out even smaller increases.
   News Corp.'s Fox, which brought in about $300 million in
the upfront market last year, is expected to make a
particularly strong showing; industry estimates for its
upfront take range from $425 million to $600 million. Fox not
only is introducing additional new programming, but has a
strong hold on the 18- to 34-year-olds advertisers love. It
also wins points among advertisers because it is sticking to
the traditional guarantee system.
   Perhaps the biggest unanswered question in the upfront
market, though, is its size. Last year, ad executives
expected modest increases at best. But a surge of buying by
auto makers set off a feeding frenzy that led to almost a 25%
increase in upfront sales to $4.2 billion. This year, ad
executives say, the auto market has clearly cooled, and they
are looking for only modest increases again.
   H. Weller "Jake" Keever, head of sales at ABC, estimates
the market will grow to $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, while
advertisers say the figure will be on the low end of that
range. Several ad executives interviewed said their clients'
budgets are flat or only marginally above last year's levels.
   But ad executives could be surprised again, just as they
were last year. Agencies have already submitted their plans
to the networks -- some more than a week ago -- and
negotiations are about to start in earnest. ABC is already
working with auto makers, and ad executives say movie firms,
which are seeing some moderate increases in spending, may
also be early out of the gate.

   Billboard Guidelines
                                                                                                       

   The Outdoor Advertising Association of America this week
will announce a new "code of advertising practices" calling
for restrictions on the placement of billboards promoting
alcohol and tobacco products.
   The OAAA, a trade group, has no power to enforce its new
code, which is expected to call for a ban on tobacco and
alcohol billboards within 500 feet of churches, hospitals,
schools and playgrounds. The group is expected to strongly
urge its member companies to adopt the code.
   But the code isn't likely to appease tobacco foes, who in
recent months have garnered hefty press for their attacks on
the outdoor ad business. In New York, for example, the Rev.
Calvin Butts got a lot of press when he whitewashed
billboards in Harlem.
   A number of big billboard companies have recently adopted
their own policies governing the placement of billboards that
pitch products illegal to minors. Patrick Media Group, for
example, instituted formal guidelines in January.

   For years, Donald Trump has said he never uses his own
money to purchase what he calls his trophies. But now it has
become clear that the developer personally guaranteed more
than $500 million of the $2 billion in bank loans to buy
them.
   If the troubled entrepreneur should be forced to sell his
major assets, and the proceeds don't cover the debt, he could
be left not only with a collapsed empire but with a huge
personal liability.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   And right now, the market value of his properties does
fall well short of the total amount of his indebtedness, both
his bankers and some of his advisers agree.
   Perhaps more ominously, a sale of most of Mr. Trump's
major properties now looks more and more likely. His bankers,
even as they consider a new $60 million credit, aren't
focusing primarily on trying to help him get back on his feet
so he can repay them. Instead, they increasingly are trying
simply to prepare for an orderly liquidation of assets.
   The only mystery remaining, several bankers say, is
whether the dismantling of Mr. Trump's real-estate and casino
empire takes place under the watchful eye of his creditors or
in bankruptcy court.
   In fact, says a person familiar with the Trump-bank
negotiations, Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened a
bankruptcy-court filing, telling the banks this could wipe
out a billion dollars worth of his debt.
   Mr. Trump, through a spokesman, declined comment over the
weekend. But while he has been uncharacteristically press-shy
of late, his few public remarks indicate he retains his
confidence. At his 44th birthday party in Atlantic City
Saturday, Mr. Trump told throngs of employees, according to
the Associated Press, that "over the years I've surprised a
lot of people. The largest surprise is yet to come."
   What that surprise may be is still anybody's guess. People
close to the negotiations say one positive development is
that talks are going on with a potential buyer of the Plaza
Hotel at a price greater than the approximately $450 million
Mr. Trump has in it.
   Such is the power of Mr. Trump's reputation that many in
financial circles continue to believe he will somehow
extricate himself from his troubles. Indeed, if the real
estate and Atlantic City markets took sharp turns for the
better, Mr. Trump could probably emerge from his troubles a
wealthy man.
   Mr. Trump's lead bankers now are demanding that he appoint
two top executives of Trump Organization -- a chief executive
officer and a chief financial officer -- a move that would
effectively rob him of day-to-day control of his own
operations. Mr. Trump, who now functions as chief executive
himself, is resisting the effort to replace him in that
position, though not the CFO appointment.
   On Friday, Mr. Trump's situation grew more precarious as
he missed the deadline on $43 million in payments on Trump
Castle bonds, and a $30 million payment to Manufacturers
Hanover Corp. If he does not come up with the money within 10
days, he could be held in default, a move that could lead to
his first loss of an asset to creditors, one of his three
Atlantic City casinos. A default also would put Mr. Trump in
jeopardy of losing his New Jersey casino licenses.
   Beyond this, a default could have consequences for the
rest of his empire as well. A single default, one of Mr.
Trump's bankers says, could trigger other defaults. Mr.
Trump's largest bank creditors are units of Bankers Trust
Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp, and Manufacturers
Hanover Corp. All four banks formally declined to comment.
   Last week Mr. Trump and his major creditors agreed to a
new $60 million credit package. Some of Mr. Trump's smaller
bank creditors are opposed to the plan. Mr. Trump's major
bankers continued to work through Saturday to persuade them
to go along.
   But even if Mr. Trump gets $60 million in breathing room,
it is unlikely to help preserve his wealth. The idea behind
the plan, say several bankers involved in the discussions, is
to wait until Mr. Trump's assets rise in value to avoid
fire-sale prices.
   "The misconception people have is that the $60 million
would give Trump time," says one person familiar with the
negotiations. "In fact, it is the banks who bought the time
to have an orderly sale of his assets" -- a strategy that may
prove risky given the current real estate and gaming markets.
   The disclosure over the past two weeks that Mr. Trump had
personally guaranteed hundreds of millions of dollars in bank
loans have come as a surprise even to some of his closest
aides. Most of these personally guaranteed loans were made
within the past two years, when Mr. Trump's celebrity status
was at its peak.
   Developers usually shun such guarantees. But for the
supremely self-confident Mr. Trump, such personal guarantees
appear to have been a key part of his leveraged modus
operandi. In fact there are indications the guarantees could
total over $600 million.
   The loans he guaranteed include three from Citicorp: $135
million on the money-losing Trump Shuttle, $125 million on
the Plaza Hotel in New York and $60 million of a construction
loan for the Trump Palace condominium tower in New York. Mr.
Trump also is believed to have guaranteed a personal loan
from Bankers Trust for over $100 million, a $75 million loan
from First Fidelity Bancorp on the Taj Mahal casino in
Atlantic City, N.J., a $10 million loan to buy his yacht and
various personal lines of credit. The yacht loan is from
Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co.
   The missed bond payment Friday caused the prices of Mr.
Trump's three casino bonds to spiral downward. Moody's
Investors Service Inc. also lowered its rating on the bonds
secured by his new Taj Mahal casino.
   After the close of business Friday, First Fidelity said it
planned to resign as the Trump Castle bondholders trustee, to
avoid the appearance of conflict of interest. It also is a
major Trump creditor. Before resigning the account, the bank
sent a notice of default to Mr. Trump, and said that if the
payment was not made within 10 days, an event of default
would occur.
   There could be serious repercussions for other properties,
say bankruptcy experts, if so-called cross-default provisions
exist allowing other creditors to start calling in their
loans too after a first default. "If one project is in
default and it's owned by an entity with other interests, it
could be a problem for him," says Alan Kornberg, a lawyer
with the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison.
   According to one banker involved in the talks, certain
such loan agreements exist, providing for creditors to claim
a loan is in default if Mr. Trump defaults on any other
asset. Those provisions raise the ante; if Mr. Trump fails to
make his bond payments within 10 days, he could default on
other properties too, giving creditors the right to
foreclose.
   Following two weeks of grueling negotiations, Mr. Trump's
four major bank creditors suspended their negotiations for
Father's Day. They are expected to be back at the table this
morning, trying to win over the smaller creditors to their
plan to extend $60 million in credit and suspend interest
payments on existing debt. Bankers say they are no closer to
an agreement than they were a week ago. Under the plan, all
of Mr. Trump's assets would be cross-collateralized, and the
money from asset sales would be thrown into a single pool.
   Banks would then take money from asset sales according to
their share of the loans. By extending further credit, the
banks are in effect betting $60 million that orderly,
well-spaced-out asset sales would bring them much more than
would a distress sale. Because some of Mr. Trump's largest
loans were syndicated to smaller creditors, about 70
institutions are involved in the discussions. Participants in
the negotiations say there are at least three major hurdles
still to be overcome.
   First, Citicorp, which has lent Mr. Trump over $1 billion,
has yet to persuade its pool of 54 creditors to go along with
the deal. The group, which includes banks from Japan,
Ireland, Brazil, South Korea, Italy and France, is an
unwieldy consortium; in particular, the banks with superior
security are reluctant to go along with a deal that puts them
on par with banks with lesser security.
   Another obstacle remains the 11 or so banks that have
purchased portions of Chase's $75 million loan securing the
retail and commercial space in Trump Tower, overlooking
Central Park. Those predominantly foreign banks are said by
people close to the discussions to be unwilling so far to
have their strong collateral mixed in with the less-secured
assets.
   Finally, Mr. Trump's New Jersey bankers, which include
First Fidelity and Midlantic, are similarly unwilling to pool
their loans with the larger banks' less-secured loans.
   Just as Mr. Trump has used the threat of a bankruptcy
filing against the major creditor banks, they have used such
a tactic against smaller creditors. They've told the smaller
creditors that even if their collateral is strong, collecting
could take years in the event of a Trump bankruptcy filing.
Thus it is in their interest to compromise, big creditors are
telling them.
   If the banks do patch together a deal in the next week and
a half, Mr. Trump and his creditors are likely to immediately
begin the painful process of selling off the exceptional
properties the high-profile developer has acquired over the
past decade.

   Heard on the Street:
   Dow Chemical Expects an Earnings Rebound,
   But Analysts Worry Over Cost of Acquisition

   Dow Chemical says there are going to be a lot of red faces
on Wall Street when its earnings rebound and the stock starts
climbing.
   "People are going to be surprised," says John Lillich,
investor relations director.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company says Wall Street analysts are overreacting to
a cyclical downturn in commodity prices while ignoring its
shift toward high-profit-margin specialty chemicals, drugs
and consumer products. Such "value-added" products will
account for 50% of Dow Chemical's 1990 profit, up from 32%
last year, and their future contribution will be greater than
many analysts think, Mr. Lillich says.
   Dow Chemical says earnings in 1991 should actually
increase, albeit "slightly," from 1990 estimates in the range
of $6.50 to $7 a share.
   That would certainly be a shock for the Street. Several
analysts recently downgraded the stock to a hold from a buy,
citing a big cost that might grow out of its Marion
Laboratories acquisition. Many say that earnings, widely
expected to drop 25% this year, are likely to be flat or down
slightly in 1991.
   A lone wolf in praising the stock is Allen Simpson, owner
of Simpson Capital Management in Philadelphia. He says the
chemical industry is poised for strong growth when the
economy picks up, which it should if interest rates fall as
he expects. Dow Chemical's estimated 20% return on equity
this year makes the stock "a strong buy" at around 10 times
this year's estimated earnings, he says. "It's significantly
undervalued" at Friday's 63 and he says it could top 90
within 12 months.
   Most analysts couldn't disagree more.
   "There has been a perception that Dow could lead the
industry in 1990 and 1991, but the outlook still isn't good.
We think the stock will only be an average performer," says
Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bache Securities. Expanding
industry capacity is expected to trigger "precipitous" price
declines starting in late 1990, prolonging softer earnings
until mid-1991, he says. This month Mr. Bogner downgraded Dow
to a hold from a buy, shaving his per-share estimates to
$6.60 for 1990 and to the same amount (down from $7.25) for
1991.
   A major concern is the $1.5 billion some think Dow
Chemical may still have to pay in connection with its Marion
Laboratories acquisition; it now holds 67% of a combined
Marion Merrell Dow. Dow Chemical promised to pay as much as
that amount on Sept. 30, 1991 -- or a larger amount in 1992
-- if Marion Merrell shares don't reach specified levels.
(Dow Chemical's obligation would decline incrementally if
Marion Merrell's shares top $30, and would reach zero if they
hit $45.77.)
   But the Street is skeptical that Marion Merrell, at 23 1/2
Friday, will rise beyond the low to mid-30s. Two mainstay
drugs, the heart drug Cardizem and the nonsedating
antihistamine Seldane, lose marketing exclusivity in 1992 and
1994, yet the company hasn't announced major new drugs to
replace ground that may be lost to generics.
   Even if Marion Merrell shares reach $35, Dow Chemical
would have to fork over roughly $1 billion at an awkward
time. With earnings down and capital spending peaking at $2
billion a year, Dow Chemical is expected to have negative
cash flow in 1991. A major outlay for Marion could force the
company to increase debt.
   The Marion situation is "the catalyst" for downgrading
Dow, says Paul Leming of Morgan Stanley. He says the company
faces a "high probability" of paying the maximum $1.5 billion
liability at the same time it is experiencing a "classic
end-of-cycle cash flow problem." Nonetheless, Mr. Leming says
Dow presents a "paradox." He still thinks the shares could
climb to $75 or $80 in the next year, despite "diminishing
likelihood of positive developments" as 1991 earnings slip to
perhaps $6 a share.
   Analysts say Dow's new products, such as Spiffits cleaning
towels, aren't big enough to compensate for sagging commodity
prices. Ethylene prices, for example, are expected to drop an
additional 35% over the next 20 months.
   "I don't see any great blockbuster coming down the pike
that will make a major improvement in Dow's profitability
over the next three to four years," says William R. Young of
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. The shares could rise or fall
depending on the economy, says Mr. Young, who has a neutral
rating on the stock.
   Dow remains attractive for long-term investors, says Avi
Nash of Goldman Sachs, though the stock isn't on the firm's
recommended list. With leading products, geographic
diversity, a strong position in Europe and low production
costs, he says, the company should rebound with solid growth
in 1992 or 1993.

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- The few investors who were hoping the Federal
Reserve would soon push interest rates lower are abandoning
that view and now are hoping the Fed will ease later this
summer.
   But these investors may be missing the point. According to
some international bond-market analysts, investors should
stop crying about the Fed and start focusing on the bigger
problem: even if the Fed did ease access to credit, rate
reductions might not stick because the U.S. is about to enter
a heated world-wide competition for investors' money.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The reduced hope of Fed easing was evident in the bond
market Friday when prices dropped nearly one point, or $10
for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The sell-off was
triggered by news that industrial production rose 0.6% in
May, indicating that recent declines in manufacturing have
ended and that production is beginning to pick up again.
Another report, the consumer price index, confirmed that
inflation is slowing, but that the rate of progress has been
painfully slow.
   The industrial-production reports, when viewed along with
an index of business activity issued earlier this month by
the National Association of Purchasing Management, "seem to
be saying that the worst is over in manufacturing and
activity is stabilizing," said Norman Robertson, chief
economist at Mellon Bank Corp. "The inflation numbers were
generally favorable, but I don't think they are good enough
to trigger an easing of Fed policy."
   Meanwhile, international analysts see pressures abroad
that could make it more costly for the U.S. government to
borrow money and thereby drive up interest rates.
   These investors contend that recent declines in U.S. bond
yields have made the Treasury market less attractive to
foreign investors. They say that cash is already being
diverted away from the U.S. in favor of Europe and Japan.
   "In the competition for international savings, countries
with the highest level of rates will have an advantage," said
Hung Q. Tran, director of fixed-income research for Deutsche
Bank Group, Frankfurt.
   Currently, yields on U.S. Treasury securities are about
8.4% compared with 8.9% in West Germany and 11.3% in Britain.
   With rates in the U.S. trailing rates in other countries
while U.S. inflation remains higher than in West Germany and
Japan, "it's hard to justify lower U.S. yields," said Mr.
Tran.
   Another factor that will keep interest rates from falling
is the sheer size of the government's future cash needs.
   Lacy Hunt, economist at Carroll McEntee &amp; McGinley Inc., a
primary dealer of government bonds, estimates that the
government raised $31 billion in new cash in the second
quarter, which is $19 billion more than expected. He said
government borrowings in the third quarter could raise more
than $70 billion, more than double the amount of new cash
raised in the third quarter a year ago. He said the
additional funds are needed to finance the Resolution Trust
Corp., the federal thrift bailout agency.
   "This sum of money will constitute a very significant test
for the U.S. financial markets," said Mr. Hunt, because while
the U.S. is tapping the debt market, West Germany will also
be vying for investors as it begins to raise billions of
dollars to finance reunification with East Germany.
   Earlier this year, bond yields in West Germany surpassed
rates in the U.S. for the first time in more than a decade.
Mr. Hunt says this situation could give West Germany an edge
over the U.S. Even if the West German bond auctions don't
siphon money from Treasurys, he says the U.S. market will
become "sensitive to world-wide pressures."
   The Treasury market may find itself in competition with
Britain and Japan, too.
   In recent weeks, a flood of foreign cash has swamped the
British bond market due to speculation that the Britain pound
will soon enter the European Monetary System's exchange-rate
mechanism. Joining EMS could be good for gilts because it
would help to stabilize the pound, force Britain to contain
inflation and lead eventually to lower interest rates.
   The prospects that Britain could soon join EMS triggered
one of the strongest rallies in the market's recent history.
The price of Britain's benchmark bond 11.75% issue due in
2007 has risen more than eight points in the past five weeks
while the issue's yield has slid to 11.30% from 12.25%,
according to James Capel &amp; Co., London.
   According to Geoffrey Dennis, chief international
economist at James Capel, "a lot of overseas" investors were
big buyers of the British bonds, known as gilts. Mr. Dennis
said the opportunity for investors to earn high current
yields on British gilts, with limited currency risk, "is a
situation where investors feel this is too good an
opportunity to miss."
   Mr. Tran at Deutsche Bank said that many of the investors
rushing to put money in the British market were from Japan
and the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia. In recent
months, the Saudis have been selling large amounts of gold
and using the proceeds to buy British bonds, and to a smaller
degree, U.S. bonds.
   "Middle Eastern investors are moving away from physical
assets. They like high-yielding bond markets like in Britain
because with the prospects of the pound moving into EMS the
high yields are more attractive and the currency risk will
diminish," said Mr. Tran. Currencies in EMS trade within
specified trading bands. A band limits how far one currency
can trade away from its assigned level without prompting a
change in monetary policy.
   Japanese investors, who also have been big buyers of U.S.
Treasury securities in the past, seem to be losing interest
in the U.S. market in favor of Europe and their own market.
   Daniel Ceto, an economist at Nikko Securities Co., said
that Japanese investors have sold more U.S. Treasury
securities this year than they have purchased. He said this
trend is likely to continue into the third quarter, which
could cause "some difficulties" for the Treasurys, he said.
   No one expects foreign investors to completely ignore the
U.S. Treasury market. After all, Treasurys still are
considered the safest and most liquid market in the world and
the U.S. designation as the No. 1 "safe haven" remains
intact. And with political uncertainties abroad, some foreign
investors are likely to find the U.S. attractive.

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell sharply after the government reported
that industrial production in May was stronger than expected.
   Industrial output rose 0.6% compared with the 0.4%
economists expected, dashing hopes that the Federal Reserve
would ease monetary policy in the near term. The government
also revised April's industrial production to show the rate
as unchanged instead of the previously estimated 0.4%
decline.
   "The hard fact is that the economy is still expanding, and
people didn't like that," said Robert Chandross, a vice
president and economist at Lloyds Bank PLC.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
103 15/32 to yield 8.42% compared with 104 11/32 to yield
8.34% on Thursday. The benchmark bond was down a full point
by midday, but retraced some of their declines on late
position-squaring, dealers said.
   Other economic news -- the consumer price index report and
the merchandise trade deficit -- had little effect on bond
prices.
   A major focus in the corporate bond market was Chrysler
Corp. Although the auto maker's bonds were reeling from a
sweeping downgrade of its debt, Chrysler's financing unit
braved the public debt market with a $300 million debt issue.
   Chrysler Financial offered investors two-year notes that
were priced to yield 10.33% -- two percentage points higher
than yields on two-year Treasury notes. The transaction was
managed by First Boston Corp. and Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets.
   The debt offering comes one day after Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp. downgraded certain Chrysler debt and several days after
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing the
ratings of $22.28 billion of debt of Chrysler and its units
for possible downgrading.
   In an unusual twist, underwriters led by First Boston
Corp. offered investors a unique form of bondholder
protection.
   Essentially, investors can sell the notes back to the
company at the offering price if Chrysler's debt rating is
downgraded by Moody's to below investment grade. The feature,
called a put option, applies during the current review of
Chrysler Financial debt by Moody's.
   "This kind of put has never been done before," said
Richard duBusc, managing director and head of syndicate at
First Boston Corp. Mr. duBusc said that about 60% of the
Chrysler issue was already sold. Insurance companies, banks
and money managers were among the prime buyers of the notes.
   On Thursday, underwriters at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
were forced to pull a $100 million issue of Chrysler
Financial five-year notes, market sources said.
   The note issue was targeted to be priced at a spread of
1.10 percentage points above the Treasury's five-year note
but was withdrawn in the wake of the Moody's credit review
announcement Wednesday and S&amp;P's anticipated action.
   In the junk-bond market, prices ended mixed Friday. Most
bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. rose sharply with the pay-in-kind
bond advancing between 1 3/4 points and 1 5/8 points. PIK
bonds pay interest in the form of additional securities.
   The junk bonds of casinos operated by developer Donald
Trump were sharply lower on news that until negotiations
between Mr. Trump and his bankers are completed, interest and
principal payments due on Trump Castle bonds won't be made.
   Trump Castle Funding's 13.75% first-mortgage bonds due in
1997 ended three points lower at 55 1/2 in over-the-counter
trading. The Trump Taj Mahal 14% first-mortgage bonds, due in
1998, slipped 1 1/2 points to end at 54 on the American Stock
Exchange while Trump Plaza Funding's 12 7/8%, due in 1998,
were unchanged at 80.

   Canadian Dollar Risks Losing Japanese Support
   As Constitutional Crisis Nears Boiling Point

   NEW YORK -- With Canada's constitutional crisis near the
boiling point, the Canadian dollar runs the risk of losing
some of its most loyal supporters in recent years: the
Japanese.
   Because of persistently high Canadian interest rates,
traders say, the Japanese have faithfully helped rescue the
Canadian dollar during hard times in the past -- even when
those high rates started to upset the economy. In the bond
market Friday, the 10-year Canadian government bond yielded
10.67%, well above the 8.44% yield on the equivalent U.S.
Treasury issue.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But some currency specialists say Canada's rates might
lose some of their appeal if the nation's political scene
gets any stormier. Manitoba and Newfoundland have yet to
approve the so-called Meech Lake accord that all 10 Canadian
provinces must ratify by Saturday. The accord, negotiated
three years ago at Meech Lake, Quebec, would recognize Quebec
as a "distinct society" within Canada. Quebec has threatened
to secede if the pact doesn't pass.
   If the worst-case scenario is borne out and Quebec
announces a quest for independence, knee-jerk sales are
expected to jolt all of Canada's financial markets.
   In the case of Japanese investment, however, more
worrisome is the possibility that capital flow from Japan
will dry up over the long run, leaving the Canadian dollar
particularly vulnerable, some analysts say.
   There probably wouldn't be an "instant collapse" in
Japanese investment in the Canadian financial markets because
secession by Quebec would take a number of years, says Klaus
Pringsheim, president of the Canada-Japan Trade Council, an
independent, nonprofit organization in Ottawa.
   "What will be affected," he says, "is the willingness to
put more" money into Canada.
   Japanese portfolio investment in Canada totaled 40 billion
Canadian dollars (US$34.1 billion) last year while Japanese
direct investment in business ventures amounted to C$4.2
billion, says Mr. Pringsheim, adding that the level of direct
investment was up sharply from C$605 million in 1980 because
of strong interest in manufacturing and other sectors.
   Although the level of American and British investment in
Canada has been greater than that of the Japanese in the last
few years, Japan's interest has been of "significant"
benefit, Mr. Pringsheim says.
   Late Friday here, the Canadian dollar was quoted at 85.38
U.S. cents, marginally higher than 85.37 cents late Thursday.
In early January, the Canadian dollar rose above 86 cents and
traded at its highest levels in more than nine years.
   The Canadian dollar plummeted to 83.79 U.S. cents May 22
after Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's chief Quebec political
lieutenant, Lucien Bouchard, resigned and worries about the
future of Quebec intensified. But it has firmed in jittery
dealings in the past few weeks, with traders watching each
new twist in the wrangling about the Meech Lake accord.
   In the near term, it wouldn't be surprising to see a range
of 82 cents to 84 cents, Mr. Pringsheim says.
   Relatively high interest rates can bolster a currency
because they draw buyers to investments denominated in the
unit, and they make yields attractive in the Eurocurrency
market. And some believe it will be hard to stem the hearty
appetite in Tokyo.
   "Canada won't disappear" even if the political picture
isn't pretty, says Naota Kanemitsu, vice president of
treasury at Fuji Bank Canada in Toronto. "So far, the
interest rate differential {between Canadian and U.S. issues}
is very attractive. The return is a very, very good return."
   Takeaki Misumi, treasurer at Sumitomo Bank of Canada in
Toronto, agrees. "The most important factor for Japanese
investors is the interest rate differential. It seems
Canadian interest rates aren't likely to go down so fast," he
says. But while Mr. Misumi is upbeat, he concedes that there
is growing Japanese interest in the financial markets of
other nations, including West Germany and Spain.
   Even if the Japanese are seen buying the Canadian dollar
on any dips that may occur in coming weeks as Canada tries to
get its political act together, some analysts believe the
currency has a lot more troubles than Japanese purchases can
solve.
   "The Canadians have got problems beyond Quebec," says
Roger Shields, chief international economist at Chemical
Bank. He and others say any remaining confidence in Canada's
economy may soon erode, because of sluggishness in a number
of sectors and the nation's shrinking merchandise trade
surplus. "A very low-growth economy" isn't very encouraging,
he says.
   As for the U.S. dollar, continued jittery trading within a
range is deemed likely. Traders will be tracking interest
rates closely. Late Friday in New York, the dollar traded at
1.6875 marks and 153.90 yen, down from 1.6935 marks and
154.17 yen late Thursday.
   In Tokyo Monday, the dollar was trading at 153.98 yen soon
after opening at 153.77 yen; it closed Friday in Tokyo at
154.52 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.6880 marks, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 1.6938 marks.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $349.50 an ounce, up $2.70.
Estimated volume was a light 2.4 million ounces.

   Watson Doesn't Use Gentle Persuasion to Enlist
   Japanese and German Support for Genome Effort

   WASHINGTON -- Here is James Watson's recipe for winning
support for a vast international science project: Taunt the
Germans for their fears about science, bash the Japanese for
"freeloading," and dish out money to your opponents to knock
the program.
   Somehow it works for Mr. Watson, the brash Nobel Prize
winner who heads the U.S. government's $3 billion effort to
decipher the human genetic code. "He administers by
petulance," says Norton Zinder, a biologist who chairs a
National Institutes of Health advisory committee for this
so-called human genome project.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Watson compares the genome project's ambitious goals
-- mapping the body's 100,000 or so genes and figuring out
exactly how they're constructed -- to landing a man on the
moon. In contrast to the U.S.'s Apollo moon program, though,
he proposes that all major industrial nations share in the
cost of the work and the rewards, which could include new
medical technology, drugs and treatments. "Our main
motivation is to find out the nature of diseases," he says.
   In pursuit of this laudable goal, the 62-year-old official
employs a sharp-edged nationalism rarely seen among
scientists. His views reflect mounting fear among U.S.
officials that this nation can't keep its technological lead
without getting tough with competitors. For example, Frank
Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, is
pushing Japanese industry to pay U.S. colleges $100 million a
year to close a "training" trade gap that he says is produced
by the 24,000 Japanese students who study here. And the
Energy Department is pressing Japan and South Korea to
contribute a total of as much as $2.6 billion to its
superconducting supercollider.
   "Everybody is skittish; they {U.S. officials} are elbowing
people" to raise money from abroad, says Rep. Ralph Hall, a
Texas Democrat who chairs a House Science Committee panel on
international cooperation.
   No one has sharper elbows than Mr. Watson. He started his
international campaign last spring, hectoring Germany for
hesitating to join the genome project because of fears that
genetic information could be abused, as it was by the Nazis.
"This may tell us something about Germany," he told a
conference here. "That it's so horrified of what it did in
the past, that it's afraid to move into the future."
   Then he turned to Japan, whose government funds scientific
research at less than half the rate of the U.S. In July, he
sent three bitter letters to Kenichi Matsubara, a Japanese
scientist trying to organize a genome effort there. Unless
Japan coughed up more money for the genome project, Mr.
Watson implied, the U.S. would block Japanese scientists from
getting valuable research. "I have little enthusiasm for
being a supplicant before a nation that should much more
spontaneously begin to return the generosity with which
America has treated Japan ever since the war ended," he
lectured Mr. Matsubara.
   After the letter was leaked, Mr. Watson made his threats
about withholding data from the Japanese more explicit at
congressional hearings, which only added to his luster here.
According to William Raub, acting director of the National
Institutes of Health: "He's captured a set of concerns, if
not angst, of many in industry, high levels of the executive
branch and Congress."
   In Japan, the reaction has been one of consternation.
Nobuyoshi Shimizu, a Keio University scientist, called Mr.
Watson's letters "blackmail." Mr. Matsubara says he agrees
that Japanese science is underfunded but says "we don't work
according to his {Mr. Watson's} suggestions." Japan now
spends about $6.6 million on genome work, Mr. Matsubara
estimates, and may increase that next year to between $10
million and $13 million.
   But that's a pittance compared with the U.S. For the
fiscal year starting Oct. 1, the Bush administration proposes
nearly doubling genome funding to $155.9 million from the
current $87.4 million. Over 15 years, the federal government
is expected to spend $3 billion on the project.
   In light of those figures, Mr. Watson complains that
Japan's contribution "isn't proportional to their national
wealth." A U.S. genome consultant, Robert Cook-Deegan, wrote
Mr. Matsubara suggesting Japanese funding of between $30
million and $50 million, which he said should double in a few
years.
   Personality partly explains Mr. Watson's demands. He
revels in the outrageous. He made one of the century's
greatest discoveries -- the structure of the genetic material
called DNA -- then wrote a best-seller about it, twitting his
colleagues and competitors. He wanted John McEnroe to play
him in his life story, says a Watson aide, because he
identifies with the tennis star's rudeness and brains. He is
also miffed at the Japanese for inviting him to head a
proposed Asian research organization in the early 1980s and
never coming through with the money to start the project.
   But Mr. Watson can be a canny science politician, too; he
understands the effect his fame and stature have on people.
He prodded NIH to back the genome project and revise it, well
after the Energy Department originally proposed it. Then he
successfully lobbied Congress for extra funds for NIH, so
that it now dominates the joint NIH-Energy program.
   As NIH's genome chief, Mr. Watson has become the de facto
leader of the federal effort -- though he retains his other
position as head of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a
privately owned laboratory on Long Island that gets $13
million in NIH research grants. "Jim is standing like a
colossus over the whole program," says Mr. Zinder, who chairs
the NIH advisory panel.
   Mr. Watson's Japan initiative may turn out to be a shrewd
move. By publicly embarrassing the Japanese, he wins friends
in Congress for a project that has been bitterly attacked in
the U.S. by rival scientists, and he gives allies in Japan a
weapon to prod their government to increase spending on
science. The Japanese call this "gaiatsu," literally "foreign
pressure," but pressure of a kind that lets Japanese
bureaucrats make changes that they want to make but fear to
because of domestic opposition.
   "Watson makes this human genome project a big issue," says
Michio Oishi, a Tokyo University biologist trying to organize
the genome project there. "That makes the government want to
get into the business. It helps."
   Not all of Mr. Watson's attention is focused abroad, of
course. He helps set priorities for U.S. genome research,
lures leading researchers to join the project and brokers
deals among scientists whose work may overlap. Persuasion and
prestige are his main tools. At NIH, the power to direct
funds largely resides in independent panels of scientists
that judge the merit of research proposals, not in center
directors such as Mr. Watson.
   From the beginning, Mr. Watson also has insisted the
project spend at least 3% of its money studying the ethical
implications of genetic advances and holding town meetings on
the problems. Among the tough questions to be resolved:
Should employers and insurance companies have access to DNA
records of employees?
   Much of the ethics money will probably go to critics of
the program, worries Mr. Cook-Deegan, the genome consultant,
and that could backfire politically.
   So what, responds Mr. Watson. He has already charmed
Jeremy Rifkin, biotechnology's most vociferous critic, by
backing Mr. Rifkin's call for an "absolute" right of privacy
over genetic records. "On important issues, I find that it
pays not to hide your feelings," Mr. Watson says.

   The International Trade Commission in March found that the
patent was valid, a setback for Moleculon and another
marketer of cefadroxil, Biocraft Laboratories Inc., Elmwood
Park, N.J. Biocraft has settled its dispute with
Bristol-Myers. Moleculon said it expects a subsequent court
hearing on the assessment of damages to Bristol-Myers and
that Kalipharma intends to appeal the court ruling.

   Ford, Breaking With Recent Practice,
   Unveils Broad Midyear Price Increases

</IN>
<LP>
   Ford Motor Co., for the first time in three years,
announced broad, midyear price increases ranging from $58 to
$134 on many of its cars and trucks.
   The move is unusual because U.S. auto makers have
generally avoided midyear, base-price increases for the past
few years. Also, the U.S. auto market has been relatively
soft since February. Sales of Ford's cars and trucks fell 14%
in May from a year-earlier levels.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the No. 2 auto maker needed to raise base prices on
most 1990 models and one 1991 model "to partially offset
increases in ongoing operating costs and product-related
costs," Robert L. Rewey, vice president-North American sales
operations, said in a statement.
   In March, Ford raised option prices by an average of $29.
A month later, General Motors Corp. also boosted option
prices. Neither GM nor Chrysler Corp. have announced any
broad vehicle base-price increases, however. Ford said it
didn't change option prices in its latest action.
   The increase in base prices for cars, which took effect
Friday, averages $49, or three-tenths of one percent. The
boost in truck prices averages $95, or six-tenths of one
percent. Ford didn't cut prices on any models, a spokesman
said.
   The largest increase came on the new 1991 Ford Explorer
sport utility vehicle, which was introduced only last March
with a base price of $19,015. Ford raised Explorer's base
price 0.7% or $134 to $19,149.
   Explorer has sold well since March, but another new Ford
product, the redesigned Escort subcompact, hasn't. Combined
sales of the new Escort and the model it replaces were off
17.2% in May; Ford didn't change price on either version.
Base prices for the Mercury Tracer, introduced June 14, and
the Mercury Capri, due out in July, were also unchanged. "We
felt it wasn't necessary" with the newer models, the Ford
spokesman said.
   Ford also didn't raise prices on other, less-popular
products including 1990 Ford Ranger compact pickup truck, the
1990 Ford Probe sporty car and the Festiva subcompact. "Those
vehicles aren't selling as well," the Ford spokesman said. A
price hike could further dampen sales that already "need
stimulation."
   The biggest price jump on passenger cars came on Ford's
top three luxury models. The base prices of the 1990 Lincoln
Town Car, Continental and Mark VII all rose by $122. The new
price for the Town Car is $28,110; for the Continental,
$29,546; and for the Mark VII, $29,369.
   Sales of the Town Car during the first five months of the
year have been stronger than the Continental and Mark VII,
showing a 39.1% increase during the period.
   The smallest price increase, $58, came on the two-door
Ford Tempo GL, now $9,541, the Mustang LX sedan, $9,514; and
the two-door Topaz GS, $10,065.

   Pickens Poised Again to Battle Koito
   But Sees Little Chance of Early Gains

   TOKYO -- Proclaiming himself wiser in the ways of Japanese
business, Texas oilman and corporate raider T. Boone Pickens
Jr. comes to Japan this week for another round of battle with
Koito Manufacturing Co.
   But analysts, and even Mr. Pickens himself, don't expect
this visit to produce any breakthroughs in his campaign to
gain a voice in the auto-parts company's operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As the largest shareholder, Mr. Pickens has been fighting
for more than a year for seats on Koito's board as well as
access to the company's financial records and pricing
policies. Through Amarillo, Texas-based Boone Co., a merchant
bank he controls, Mr. Pickens owns a 26% stake in Koito.
   "Sure, I've learned a lot in a year's time," Mr. Pickens
said in a telephone interview. "But I don't have any hope
that Koito will change its mind."
   Nevertheless, Mr. Pickens is determined to make his
presence felt at Koito's annual shareholders' meeting June
28. He is paying the airfare for 50 other Americans who own
Koito shares so they can attend the session in Tokyo with
him. And in a sugary appeal for support, he mailed videotapes
to around 4,000 Koito holders. In the video, which cost about
$20,000 to produce, Mr. Pickens outlines his proposals --
which include representation on the board, increased dividend
payments and an anti-greenmail resolution -- as he rides
horseback across the Texas range.
   "I've done everything I can to make it clear I am a
long-term investor," insists Mr. Pickens.
   But Koito is hardly preparing a red-carpet welcome. The
company argues that Mr. Pickens is really a greenmailer --
someone who tries to force a company to buy back his shares
at a premium. Mr. Pickens is welcome to attend the annual
meeting -- the company will even provide simultaneous
interpretation for the visiting Americans -- but that's as
far as the hospitality may go. "All of his proposals will be
denied," a Koito spokesman says.
   Koito's top brass aren't the only ones skeptical of Mr.
Pickens's intentions. Last week, Koito's labor union adopted
a resolution urging management to reject Mr. Pickens's
proposals. Sources say Japanese banks also are under pressure
to refrain from lending money to Mr. Pickens or any companies
associated with him.
   Mr. Pickens confirmed reports that a U.S. subsidiary of a
major Japanese bank had withdrawn its intent to join a group
of banks that backs Mesa Limited Partners Oil &amp; Gas Co., a
publicly held company that Mr. Pickens heads.
   Other major shareholders such as Toyota Motor Corp.,
Nissan Motor Co. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
appear to have no time or sympathy for Mr. Pickens. "We
contacted all the large shareholders and said we'd like to
call on them. They have all said they will be out of town,"
says Mr. Pickens.
   While Koito and its supporters may be turning a deaf ear
to Mr. Pickens's complaints, Mr. Pickens has found more eager
listeners back in the U.S. Tapping into growing U.S.
resentment of Japanese business practices, Mr. Pickens has
emerged as a spokesman for those frustrated by Japan's
closely connected corporate relationships and has taken his
case to Washington to testify before congressional
committees.
   Analysts in Tokyo agree that Koito and Mr. Pickens seem
headed for a long, drawn-out fight. Mr. Pickens is suing
Koito in Tokyo District Court for access to its accounting
books and other records. He says Koito's pricing policies
favor Toyota -- its second largest holder, with a 19% stake
-- to the detriment of other holders. The next hearing is set
for July 12.

   Amoco Will Post
   2nd-Quarter Gain
   On Iran Payment

   CHICAGO -- Amoco Corp. said the settlement for about $600
million of all claims and counterclaims between it and Iran
will result in an undetermined second-quarter gain.
   The company said it expects to receive by the end of June
a net payment of about $594 million but that the gain will be
offset by income taxes and a charge that will also be booked
in the second quarter. The amount of the charge is
undetermined, in line with the completion of a study under
which the company has targeted specific worksites for
environmental cleanup.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the year-earlier quarter, the energy concern had net
income of $497 million, or 96 cents a share, on revenue of
$6.76 billion.
   The settlement ends Amoco's claims for compensation for
the seizure by Iran of its two major Iranian operations in
1978 and 1979. In Washington, U.S. officials said the
settlement wouldn't have any direct bearing on the chances of
gaining release of the six U.S. hostages still held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. "It's really not related,"
said a senior State Department official, pointing out that
Iran will be paying money, not receiving it.
   Nevertheless, the Bush administration privately hopes that
such progress at The Hague, and the promise of more, will
help induce economically strapped Iran to prod the Lebanese
kidnappers into fresh releases. President Bush has adopted a
policy of making whatever gestures appear reasonable in their
own right -- such as working to clear up claims -- and hoping
Tehran interprets them as favorable gestures.
   However, claims settlements so far seem to have had little
impact on the hostage problem. After a series of claims
settlements last month, no hostages were released, and Iran's
line even seemed to harden. Tehran and its allies are
demanding the release of Shiite prisoners from Israel and
Kuwait before any more hostages are released, and anti-U.S.
feelings have been rising in the Middle East lately as the
war of words against Israel has heated up.

   Micron Technology Inc., continuing to suffer from
cutthroat competition in the semiconductor industry, reported
net income for its fiscal third quarter plunged 93% to $1.8
million, or five cents a share.
   Micron's third consecutive quarterly decline in profit
came as revenue slipped 29% to $84.1 million from $119.2
million. In the year-earlier quarter, Micron earned $28.8
million, or 75 cents a share.

   For the nine months ended May 31, profit plummeted 98% to
$1.9 million, or five cents a share, from $90.1 million, or
$2.37 a share, a year earlier. Revenue tumbled 34% to $228
million from $343.4 million.
   Micron said the earnings declines reflect the effects of
"downward price pressure on the company's principal
products," as well as a slow and costly updating of its
product line to include the so-called one megabit dynamic
random access memory chips, or DRAMs.

   Abreast of the Market:
   Strategists' Polarity Shows Uncertainties

   Canelo, Cohen Meet
   In Bull-Bear Debate

   NEW YORK -- Peter Canelo was right in mid-1987 when he
said it was time to sell stocks. Abby Joseph Cohen was right
immediately after the Oct. 19, 1987, crash in saying that a
recession wouldn't follow and that the time was right to buy
stocks.
   Today, Mr. Canelo is an unrestrained bull. He says the Dow
Jones Industrial Average could rise as high as 3350 before
the end of the year. Mrs. Cohen, now very much a bear, sees a
potential 25% drop in the stock market in the near term,
assuming interest rates don't decline further.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These investment strategists can't both be right, and the
disparity of the positions they represent is producing a smog
of uncertainty that permeates the stock market these days.
   Mr. Canelo, of Bear Stearns, and Mrs. Cohen, of Barclays
de Zoete Wedd Research, dropped by The Wall Street Journal
offices last week for a debate about the market's future
course. The two-hour session was cordial, but the two
expressed sharply contrasting views of stock valuations,
earnings expectations, prospects for industrial growth, and
the outlook for interest rates.
   Mrs. Cohen believes the market is overvalued, that
investors have bid it up on the strength of overly optimistic
earnings expectations, and that the Federal Reserve Board
won't ease interest rates soon. She thinks investors ought to
be in bonds.
   Mr. Canelo believes the market is fairly valued. While he
agrees that earnings expectations generally are too high, he
is more optimistic than Mrs. Cohen, because he foresees a
surge in the industrial sector that Mrs. Cohen doesn't. And
he believes conditions may be right for the Fed to ease
interest rates, possibly as early as this summer.
                                                                                                       

   Stock Valuations
                                                                                                       

   "There's no measurement in my usual tool kit which tells
me this market is cheap," Mrs. Cohen says. "On a variety of
measures, this market is approaching the kind of valuation
levels you had in the summer of 1987. That's something that
doesn't give me great comfort."
   Mr. Canelo agrees that an overpriced market must top out,
but this isn't where the market is now, he says. "If you
think earnings {per share for the 500 companies in Standard &amp;
Poor's stock index} are $22, then the market is expensive,
but if you think earnings power is around $25 on the S&amp;P,
then price-earnings ratios are average for the last 25 years
-- 14.5."
   The critical factor, he says, is inflation. The ratio of
stock prices to per-share earnings falls when inflation
rises. So if inflation is moderating, a higher ratio is
acceptable. Even if earnings don't improve but inflation
continues to ease -- as Mr. Canelo expects -- then a ratio of
16 to 18 may be the result, which generally alarms some
investors. "I agree if multiples are too high, that's a
problem." he says. "I just don't think they're that high."
                                                                                                       

   Earnings Estimates
                                                                                                       

   Mrs. Cohen believes the market has already been bid up on
the basis of sanguine earnings estimates. One consensus
measure says analysts are expecting the S&amp;P 500 companies to
earn a little more than $27 a share this year and $31.50 next
year. "If you believe those kinds of numbers, the market is
reasonabley priced," she says, but she is projecting $22 for
this year. "What I worry about is whether analysts and
investors are building into their heads -- when they pay
those multiples -- those consensus profit numbers."
   Mrs. Cohen believes earnings growth momentum peaked last
year. Mr. Canelo doesn't see a peak coming until the 1991
first quarter.
   Mr. Canelo agrees that consensus earnings estimates are
unrealistic. But "On the whole, I don't think investors are
that bullish," he says, noting that stocks are still
performing better than bonds. "The only time the stock market
has run into a valuation brick wall vs. bonds is when the
bond market is near or above the return on stocks. That was
the case in 1981, '84 and '87. We don't have that comparison
now."
   Mrs. Cohen, however, says that unless earnings do
fabulously well in the next two quarters, "There's going to
be disappointments" that will hurt stock prices.
                                                                                                       

   Industrial Growth
                                                                                                       

   At the core of Mr. Canelo's earnings-growth optimism is
the belief that the economy's industrial sector is poised for
a new surge. He believes that industrial prices, which were
weak in the fourth quarter, are firming, and that industrial
profits will soon follow. He notes that recent surveys of
purchasing managers indicate increased buying.
   Underlying this theme is Mr. Canelo's conviction that
Eastern Europe is providing a fertile new field for
industrial growth that will benefit U.S. companies.
   "Despite the continuing story on the Street that the
primary benefits from Eastern Europe will come to the
Coca-Colas and McDonald's and Levis, our greatest strength
and potential benefits come from the technology area," Mr.
Canelo says. "It's no accident that when the market was
tanking earlier this year, in January when interest rates
were rising, that some of the old-line technology stocks
actually rallied, along with some of the new-technology
stocks and some of capital goods companies. This is the
Berlin Wall coming down."
   But Mrs. Cohen doesn't expect such benefits from
developments in Eastern Europe any time soon. "Ultimately,
there could be quite a terrific benefit for U.S.
manufacturers," she says. "What I'm concerned about are the
mechanics of how that happens and the time frame. For
example, when you take a look at U.S. trade with Eastern
Europe, you've got to realize that less than 2% of U.S. trade
is done with Eastern Europe right now. Even if that were to
double, which I think is a grossly optimistic kind of
assumption in the near term, you're not talking about a very
big number."
   But Mr. Canelo says industrial companies are in better
shape than other businesses, because the era of merger mania
during the past five years generally bypassed the
industrials, "so their balance sheets actually look pretty
good."
                                                                                                       

   Interest Rates
                                                                                                       

   Mrs. Cohen asks Mr. Canelo: "If you think the
re-acceleration {of industrial growth} has already begun, why
do you think the Fed will ease interest rates?"
   "Because you have softness in the consumer world," Mr.
Canelo replies, "which is more pronounced than any of us had
probably anticipated."
   Mr. Canelo believes gold prices are an important indicator
of Fed policy. "A 15% move {downward} in gold prices in the
past has always led to some kind of improvement in the
economy and one heck of a bull-market move in stocks," he
says. Gold has dropped that much since February.
   Mrs. Cohen, however, isn't convinced that the Fed is ready
to lower interest rates to increase liquidity. "Typically,
when you have a liquidity-driven market where it's the Fed
helping you out," she says, "you're emerging from a
recession, not from seven or eight years of continuing
growth."
   And while the Fed might decide to do something for
domestic purposes because of weak consumer spending, "There's
a limit to how much they can do, because ultimately they do
worry about the currency stability, and in a world with very
high real interest rates, there's a limit to how low rates
can go in the U.S."
   But Mr. Canelo counters, "Given the weakness in retail
sales, the slowdown in employment, a pronounced weakness in
gold and oil, it looks like the Fed might have some room to
continue easing. . . . If we get bond yields down to the 8%
area again, you're talking a market well over 3000."
   Mrs. Cohen responds: "Peter is answering the question,
`What could kill the bull market and is it present?' I'm
approaching it a different way, which is: `What's going to
start another bull market?' We are in the final stages of the
bull market, and I don't see anything that's going to give us
another major upward surge in equity prices."

   Friday's Market Activity
                                                                                                       

   Broader market measures closed little changed, but the Dow
Jones Industrial Average set another record high, driven by
program trading.
   Because several economic reports failed to provide
investors with a sense of direction, the market was pulled
and tugged by waves of trading related to the quarterly
expiration of stock-index futures and options, and options on
individual stocks.
   The industrial average gained 7.67 to 2935.89, a fraction
above the previous record of 2935.19 set June 4. For the
week, the Dow rose 73.51, or 2.6%.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.01 to 362.91;
the New York Stock Exchange composite index slid 0.12 to
197.86; and the Dow Jones Equity Market index fell 0.28 to
337.65. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.1%; the Big Board
composite and the Dow Jones Equity Market indices each gained
0.9%.
   Expiration-related trading accounted for much of the
205,130,000 shares traded on the Big Board. Still, it was the
lightest trading on a quarterly expiration day, commonly
known as "triple witching hour," since Dec. 16, 1988, when
196.5 million shares traded. Declining issues on the New York
Stock Exchange outpaced advancers 835 to 611.
   Many investors sat out the session to avoid "the inherent
volatility" that surfaces on triple-expiration days, said
Thomas Callahan, senior vice president at Yamaichi
International (America).
   The market showed little response to the news that May
consumer prices rose 0.2%; that the April trade deficit
shrank to $6.94 billion from $8.36 billion in March; and that
industrial production and capacity utilization rose in May.
None of the reports deviated sharply from expectations,
though bond prices dropped on the news that industrial output
gained 0.6%.
   Meanwhile, uneasiness about corporate profits continued to
haunt the market, traders said. Southeast Banking, which said
it expects losses for the second quarter and year, fell 2 3/8
to 11; the company also cut its quarterly dividend.
   Merry-Go-Round Enterprises fell 3/4 to 25 7/8 on 1.1
million shares, following the completion of a 2.15-million
share offering, sold at $26.625 a share.
   DeSoto skidded 3 1/4 to 40 1/4. Sutton Holding, which has
been pursuing a $50-a-share offer for the company, submitted
an alternative proposal, under which it would pay $45 million
for DeSoto's detergent business, following the sale of its
other operations.
   McDonnell Douglas's stock price had been dropping since
Monday amid concerns about its second-quarter earnings, and
it lost another 3/4 to 38 5/8. The company wouldn't comment
on its outlook for the quarter, but denied rumors that its
bankers have asked for a reduction in its dividend.
   Wahlco Environmental Systems, which said net income for
its current fiscal year would be about 10 cents a share below
an earlier estimate because of delays in expected orders,
fell 2 3/4 to 10 3/8. The company didn't give its previous
earnings forecast.
   Salant plummeted 3 1/4 to 2 1/2. The company defaulted on
its bank credit line, by failing to make $10.8 million in
principal and interest payments, and said it is reviewing the
possibility of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing, along with
other alternatives.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index dropped
0.27 to 364.03, ending the week with a gain of 0.8%.

   NEW YORK -- Salant Corp., which emerged from bankruptcy
court three years ago, said it may again seek Chapter 11
protection after defaulting on a $10.8 million payment of
bank debt.
   The news sent Salant's shares tumbling $3.25 to close
Friday at $2.50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
wiping away more than half the company's market value. Salant
had 3.4 million common shares outstanding at the end of 1989.
At this time last year, the shares traded in a range of
$24.50 to $28.

<TEXT>
   The apparel manufacturer, which owns Manhattan Industries
Inc. and Denton Mills Inc., said that in addition to
defaulting on the payment of interest and principal, it had
failed to comply with certain covenants in its credit
agreements with its banks. And it said it was not able to
make an interest payment of $1.9 million on its 13.25% senior
notes, which was due Friday.
   Moreover, the company said it didn't expect to complete a
new factoring arrangement on its accounts by Friday, as it
had hoped, or to amend its credit agreements.
   The company said in a statement it's "in discussions with
its lenders concerning the refinancing of its credit
arrangements, and is continuing to review its financial
conditions and its options, including among others, whether
it should seek relief from its creditors" under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Telephone calls to Salant and its investment banking
advisers at Lubin Delano &amp; Co. for an explanation on the
company's announcement were not returned.
   The past year has been difficult for Salant. The company,
citing a depressed retail environment, posted a loss of $2.3
million, or 67 cents a share, in the first quarter. A year
earlier, it posted a loss of $427,000, or 12 cents a share.
Sales fell 7.8% to $101.9 million from $110.5 million.
   In 1989, although revenue rose 27% to $469.6 million, the
company reported a loss of $9.35 million or $2.72 per share
compared with a profit of $7.65 million or $2.10 per share
the year before. Most of that came from a $6.5 million charge
in the 1989 second quarter after closing its Perry Ellis
Portfolio for Women division.
   The company reported at the end of 1989 that long-term
debt totaled $169 million, with $19.8 million due in 1990.
Shareholder equity in 1989 fell to $16.5 million from $31.6
million in 1988.

   TOKYO -- Support is growing in Japan for what was once
unthinkable but now may be inevitable: importing rice.
   The first signs of what will likely be a slow, steady
public campaign to accept an end to this nation's 48-year
virtual ban on foreign rice came June 8 when Komeito, an
opposition party often allied with the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, said it would consider supporting partial
liberalization of rice trade. On June 13, Noboru Takeshita, a
former prime minister who remains a leading LDP power broker,
publicly praised the move as "courageous" and said public
opinion might shift in that direction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Recent polls have shown strong majorities of the general
public backing such a move, reversing the results of similar
surveys from two years ago.
   Top elected officials have yet to openly embrace rice
imports and most still vehemently oppose it. Last week, five
LDP Diet members flew to Washington to try and persuade the
U.S. to drop its demand. Indeed, the positive but
noncommittal stirrings also come at a time when Japan is
trying to navigate through another set of difficult trade
negotiations with the U.S., the Structural Impediments
Initiative talks slated to end by early next month. But in a
nation where shifts in government policy are often carefully
choreographed to create the necessary public opinion, some
Japanese and American officials say a change is underway.
"People living in urban areas cannot understand why we give
subsidies to the farmers who produce rice," said a government
official who supports liberalization. "We should educate
Japanese public opinion to get back to normalcy" in accepting
such a move. He said a "campaign" would start with "political
leaders," and "when the time is right, then we {government
leaders} can come out." He added that "perhaps Mr.
Takeshita's remarks" were the beginning of the drive.
   An American Embassy official asserted Friday: "The
decision's been made for quite some time. The Japanese
understand that they're big players in the world trade
environment and they're in an untenable position in insisting
on a total import embargo."
   The Japanese government's official policy, submitted in
the ongoing multilateral Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, says that a country should be
allowed "adjustment measures necessary to maintain its
required domestic production level in basic foodstuffs for
food security considerations." Both the Japanese and American
government officials interviewed said the statement doesn't
necessarily mean support for a continued import ban.
   The U.S. is asking Japan to loosen its rice policy as part
of the Uruguay Round, scheduled for completion by the end of
the year. The U.S. is also pressuring Europe to relax
agricultural trade restrictions, and is offering to do the
same if the other countries comply.
   Any change in Japan's policy would likely be symbolic,
however, at least at the beginning. Under the U.S. proposal,
countries would first convert agricultural quotas to tariffs,
then phase them out. According to U.S. calculations, Japan's
rice ban is the equivalent of a 700% tariff. If the ban were
replaced with that high a tariff, little rice would be
imported.
   Under outside pressure, Japan has over the past decade
taken down many of its formal trade restrictions. But the
U.S., recognizing the political sensitivity, had refrained
until the current GATT talks from pushing on rice, even as it
pried open Japan's beef and citrus markets two years ago. At
that time, the Diet endorsed a resolution, backed by all the
major parties, supporting the no-import rice policy.
   Japan has justified the protection of its rice farmers as
preserving cherished symbols of its agrarian heritage, and as
maintaining a policy of "food security" for a nation with new
natural resources. Consumers groups, especially housewives
organizations, have campaigned against rice imports, even
though it means higher prices. They also argue that foreign
rice is unsafe.
   (Actually, Japan does allow some importation of rice for
certain rice-based products, like rice crackers. Once,
according to one government official, Japan "borrowed" rice
from Korea during a shortage, then "paid it back" during a
surplus period.)
   But the reality is that the number of rice farmers is
dropping drastically, and many who remain do so simply for
tax breaks and government subsidies while holding other
full-time jobs. In the fiscal year ended March 31, per capita
rice consumption dropped 1.6%, the fourth consecutive annual
decline.

   Integrated Pact
   To Sell Interests
   Faces Hurdles

   NEW YORK -- Integrated Resources Inc. agreed to sell its
general partner interests in its American Insured Mortgage
Investors series of limited partnerships to Krupp Cos. for
$38.6 million.
   But it isn't clear whether the agreement will be
completed. CRI Inc. is seeking to gain control of the
interests by approaching the partnership investors directly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Integrated's agreement with Krupp was reached through an
auction supervised by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court here.
Integrated has been in bankruptcy proceedings since February,
and has been seeking to raise cash by selling assets. Krupp
is a Boston real estate investment manager.
   The agreement with Krupp, however, is conditioned on a
proposal by CRI being ended. A real estate investment trust
managed by CRI, a real estate syndicator based in Rockville,
Md., last week filed a proposal with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to offer to swap interests in two of its
real estate ventures for the Integrated partnership
interests. CRI values its proposed offer at about $664
million. CRI also filed two lawsuits accusing Integrated's
management of trying to entrench itself at the expense of the
limited partnership investors by changing the management
agreements.
   It isn't known what steps Integrated might take to try to
have CRI's proposed exchange offer ended. One option might be
for Integrated to ask the bankruptcy court to block the CRI
proposal. But the AIM partnerships themselves, which invest
in government-insured or guaranteed mortgages, aren't part of
the bankruptcy-law process and continue to operate.
   The four funds involved have about 64,000 investors.
Integrated receives income from managing the partnerships in
addition to its general partnership interest.
   The CRI proposal is "something we and Krupp are discussing
. . . right now," said Stephen D. Weinroth, Integrated
chairman. He didn't elaborate, but said that if CRI succeeds
in its proposed bid and unseats Integrated as the general
partner, "they would be obligated to give Integrated a
substantial amount of money" under the American Insured
partnership agreements for Integrated's partnership interests
in the funds, aside from management fees.
   Mr. Weinroth said he hasn't read the CRI complaint, but
said allegations that Integrated adopted "this cleverly
disguised poison pill are clearly untrue."
   A Krupp spokeswoman said she didn't know how or when the
issue might be resolved. There isn't a deadline for the pact
to be completed.
   Integrated manages more than 600 partnerships, and values
its assets at about $700 million. Mr. Weinroth said senior
creditors, who are owed about $1 billion, were told in
January they would receive about 45 to 50 cents on the
dollar. He said that figure remains "a proper valuation".
It's unclear what junior creditors, who are owed about $600
million, can expect.
   Although the auction set a minimum bid of $40 million
without conditions for the American Insured interests, CRI
said in its filing it was rebuffed in earlier efforts to
purchase the management entities from Integrated, including
an offer of $60 million in February. According to the filing,
Krupp in late May sought to have the court reduce the minimum
bid on the partnerships to $30 million. However, the pact
announced Friday calls for Integrated to receive an added
$6.5 million within a year after Krupps's $38.6 million
payment.
   Mr. Weinroth said Integrated hadn't turned down any offers
but he said CRI's $60 million offer involved substantial
deferred payments. The CRI proposal is conditioned on
Integrated reversing the change in its management contract.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Television:
   World War II a Perennial Ratings Winner
   ----

<LP>
   On the sixth of June, some 10 days ago, a network
broadcaster noted that it was "the anniversary of D-Day, when
Allied forces invaded the continent of Europe during World
War II." This slightly jarring explanation served as a
reminder that, to a very large segment of the population, the
war is history of a long-gone era. To those who grew up in
the '30s and '40s, of course, it is nothing of the sort: To
this generation, the war is always here, always alive and
lurking just under the skin.
   But even this audience does not entirely account for a
phenomenon long evident to programmers in public television,
namely the existence of an insatiable public appetite for
World War II documentaries. Six years ago, Arts &amp;
Entertainment Network made a similar discovery when it began
broadcasting the films and the ratings soared. Network
representative Brook Bailey Johnson describes the response as
amazing: "What's particularly amazing is their repeatability.
People watch them over and over."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The two most popular are "Victory at Sea" and "The
Twentieth Century." The Churchill documentary, "The Valiant
Years," also has done very well, along with "Between the
Wars," "Air Power," "Crusade in Europe" (airing Wednesdays,
8:30-9 p.m. EDT, along with two related shows) and "Why We
Fight," Frank Capra's classic indoctrination film, made under
the auspices of the U.S. Army. The audience for this material
seems to grow and includes many young people.
   None of this is news to the people at public television.
Robert Kotlowitz, vice president for arts and humanities
programming at WNET, New York's PBS channel, notes: "Every
time we rerun `The World at War' or `Victory at Sea' we do as
well as the last time or better. We did `Shoah' -- which I
consider a World War II documentary -- in four parts and the
audience got bigger and bigger as the week went on. That was
true nationally, not just in New York." "The World at War"
comes in 13 parts, Mr. Kotlowitz says. "People just get
hooked on it, including young people. After all, what greater
story is there than World War II?"
   That it is a story whose ending everyone knows is not
irrelevant to its drawing power; expectation is greater than
surprise, Coleridge told us. The grimness of the first
installments is unrelenting. Still, despite the triumphant
German blitzkrieg, the Stukas bombing Warsaw, the Belgian's
face streaming tears as the invading Germans parade through
the streets -- despite the German officer on his horse,
smiling triumphant under the Arc de Triomphe as the Wehrmacht
units march past, despite the burning ships at Pearl Harbor,
one knows where this will all end. The footage ahead is of
mobilization, the long enlistment lines outside the induction
centers the day after Pearl Harbor, the destruction of the
Japanese fleet at Midway. Of the Allied troops packed into
boats on the coast of England, the fantastic armada bearing
down on Normandy the morning of June 6, 1944. The landing
craft door drops, a British soldier turns to look back, pats
the arm of the man in front, and with the rest lurches into
the water toward the spindly tall house on shore. To
generations of viewers, that soldier, that landing craft,
that tall house on shore, are the central images of D-Day. So
is the infantryman who falls at the shore's edge, and the
one, still walking, dragged out of the water by comrades.
   The footage to come is the liberation of Paris, the
assault on Berlin and the Reichstag, the long lines of
defeated Nazi soldiers trudging home. A cameraman recorded a
scene in "The World at War" -- at a newly liberated death
camp. It is of a British officer standing face to face with
the highest ranking Nazi officer in charge. The Nazi
commandant smiles and extends his arm to shake hands. The
British officer stares icily, refusing the hand. It is a
moment -- one, like so many in these films, that sums up the
moral passion of the war.
   It goes without saying that some documentaries of this
kind are better than others. After all, what can compete with
"The World at War" -- a work so formidable dramatically and
historically, and to top it off, narrated by Sir Laurence
Olivier. One can ask almost the same question about "Victory
at Sea," with its score by Richard Rodgers. Still, every one
of the documentaries draws from the same source -- World War
II combat footage -- which is why they are getting audiences.
   No movie about the period can equal the evocative power of
these grainy black-and-white clips. Not "The Longest Day,"
fine as it is, nor any other Hollywood film, particularly war
movies of the past 30 years. For one thing, the footage is
history unadulterated by revisionism, whereas a kind of
progressive political impulse seems to have unhinged movie
makers on the subject of the war in recent years. For
example, by way of atonement for Hollywood's representation
of our wartime Japanese enemies as buck-teethed runts, there
now appears to be an unwritten law that in current movies all
Japanese military personnel be depicted as not less than
six-foot-five, noble of visage, with Hyperion's curls, vast
sensitivity and learning. A mother could ask no more for her
daughter.
   Arts &amp; Entertainment plans to continue showing the war
documentaries, it says, until it gets signals that viewers
are losing interest. If that is the case it will likely be
showing those films into the indefinite future. In "The Great
Gatsby," the narrator refers to those who could, for the last
time in the world, look on something larger and more
significant than themselves. That, for so many in it and of
it, is the meaning of The War. The heroic moment of our
century. Not surprising that the wish to keep revisiting it
is unappeasable.

   Disney's `Dick Tracy' Nabs
   Solid Turnout at Opening

   "Dick Tracy," Walt Disney Co.'s much ballyhooed summer
movie release, opened last weekend on about 2,300 screens
around the country with a solid, albeit not mind-numbing,
showing. It grossed between $22 million and $23 million,
Disney reported.
   Industry sources independently confirmed these preliminary
results. "It augurs very well for the film," said Martin
Grove, box office analyst for Baseline, an entertainment
information service. He noted that the three-day gross was a
Disney record. Last summer, "Batman" broke box-office records
with a $40.5 million opening weekend.

   Three films vied for second place. Early indications were
that "Another 48 Hours," released by Paramount Communications
Inc.'s film unit, grossed about $10.4 million. And the
premiere of "Gremlins 2," from Time Warner Inc.'s Warner
Brothers unit, took in about $10.1 million. Carolco
Pictures's "Total Recall" apparently finished fourth at $9.8
million. Official tallies are due out today.
   Although Warner officials had been upset that Disney would
include in its figures the sales of $12 to $20 "Dick Tracy"
T-shirts that counted as admission tickets for special Friday
morning showings of the film, the marketing ploy apparently
didn't have much of an impact on the box-office race.
Industry sources attributed only about $1.25 million of
Disney's gross to the T-shirt sales.
   The key for the new films' staying power will be their
second weekend: As each new mega-hyped release opens, it has
knocked back its predecessor: "Back to the Future III"
dropped 43% in its second weekend; "Total Recall" dropped
41%. "Another 48 Hours" is expected to have dropped 47%.

   A principal law firm of American Continental Corp. and its
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association unit agreed to pay $20
million to settle suits filed by stockholders and bondholders
of the defunct thrift.
   In a statement released Friday, the New York law firm of
Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler said the settlement
represents less than two percent of the maximum total
recovery sought by the plaintiffs and is covered by the
firm's insurance policies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The law firm was an adviser to the thrift and Charles H.
Keating Jr., the former head of Lincoln and chairman of
American Continental.
   Almost 22,000 small investors purchased American
Continental bonds at the thrift's California branches. The
investors say they lost approximately $300 million when
American Continental collapsed and began operating under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in April 1989. The
Lincoln Savings unit was seized by thrift regulators the same
month.
   The settlement covers all class action suits filed in
federal and California state courts. The allegations included
racketeering charges. The investors claimed they were
defrauded as a result of false financial statements made by
the thrift. The investors sought to recoup their losses from
Kaye Scholer and more than 60 other defendants, who they
allege bore some responsibility for the thrift's actions.
   "We are convinced that we committed no wrongdoing and are
not liable to anyone for the losses that have occurred," the
firm's statement said. The firm said it settled to avoid
protracted and costly litigation.
   Leonard Simon of Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie &amp; Lerach,
a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the settlement represents a
"reasonable payment" by the law firm.
   One other defendant in the case has settled. In March, the
Los Angeles law firm of Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara &amp;
Samuelian provisionally agreed to a settlement in which it
denied any wrongdoing. The arrangement calls for payment of
$4.3 million to the plaintiffs by the law firm's insurance
carriers and another $10 million in payments if that amount
isn't recouped from other defendants.

   REDLINING ALLEGATIONS against Fannie Mae are being
investigated.
   The U.S. Justice Department is investigating allegations
that the Federal National Mortgage Association has been
discriminating against lenders who want to finance
development projects in predominately black sections of St.
Louis.
   Prosecutors with the department's civil rights division
wrote Fannie Mae last month seeking records for all the
mortgages that it bought for multifamily developments in St.
Louis, and seven surrounding counties since 1985, according
to a copy of the letter.
   The agency responded with a list of 37 developments. None
involved conventional financing for projects in the St. Louis
area's predominately black neighborhoods.
   Fannie Mae is a federally chartered, publicly traded
company that operates a secondary market in mortgage loans.
It buys mortgages from lenders and packages some into
securities for sale to investors. The agency buys
approximately one in eight mortgage loans nationwide and
recently has been touting its commitment to help low-income,
moderate-income and middle-income Americans buy homes.
   A spokesman for Fannie Mae said it is cooperating with the
investigation and said it does not discriminate in any way. A
spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment.
   The allegations first came to light in April, when St.
Louis developer Bruce Ring filed a suit in federal court
alleging that Fannie Mae and First Interstate Mortgage Co. of
Illinois, a local lender in St. Louis, were redlining in the
city's depressed northern section. Redlining is the practice
by which lenders reject loan applications in poor
neighborhoods. Mr. Ring's suit, the first in the country to
accuse Fannie Mae of redlining, is pending in U.S. District
Court in St. Louis.
   Mr. Ring claimed he applied to Fannie Mae through First
Interstate last August to refinance $3.6 million in
short-term loans so he could renovate seven run-down
apartment buildings in St. Louis. Five of the properties were
in North St. Louis. According to the suit, Fannie Mae turned
down the entire application after a First Interstate vice
president inspected the five sites and described them as
being in risky locations.
   The Justice Department has also written First Interstate
requesting "statistical data" on the mortgage company's
lending practices in St. Louis and surrounding counties.
Samuel C. Ebling, First Interstate's attorney, said he did
not comply.
   A spokesman for Fannie Mae said the company "does not
approve of or condone redlining and we carry out our business
in a way that reflects that."

   PAINT COMPANY SUES INSURERS for refusing to settle
products-liability suit.
   Cook Paint &amp; Varnish Co. is facing a $20 million jury
verdict that it says could have been avoided if its carriers
hadn't resisted negotiating a settlement. Conflicts over who
should pay such awards have long existed between an insured
defendant and its carriers, but recently suits alleging
damages for failure to settle have increased.
   "It's kind of a new trend in litigation," says Robert
Adams, an attorney in the Houston firm of Dunn, Kacal, Adams,
Pappas &amp; Law, counsel for St. Louis-based Safety Mutual
Casualty Corp., one of 10 insurance carriers named in the
case. The suit seeks $70 million in damages, including $50
million in punitive damages.
   Cook, a North Kansas City, Mo., paint manufacturer, was
held liable in a case brought by Allied Tank Services Inc., a
San Antonio, Texas, maker of drinking-water tanks. Allied
said it used Cook's paints to coat the interior of some of
its water tanks, but it alleged that the paint cracked and
bubbled, contaminating the water. Last week, a state court
jury in San Antonio found Cook negligent and awarded Allied
$20 million in damages.
   Thomas W. Wagstaff, an attorney with the Kansas City firm
of Blackwell Sanders Matheny Weary &amp; Lombardi, counsel for
Cook, said the Texas trial judge will be asked to set the
verdict aside. But in the meantime, he has sued the 10
carriers in state court in Liberty, Mo., alleging that they
acted in "bad faith." The suit says Cook demanded several
times that the carriers settle the Allied suit, but
defendants refused "even though the consequences . . . could
be devastating to Cook."
   Before trial, Mr. Wagstaff says, attorneys for Allied had
offered to settle their claims for $6.5 million, a figure he
contends could have been negotiated down to between $2
million and $3 million.
   Mr. Adams says many of the carriers weren't notified about
the Allied suit until it was being tried. They had
insufficient time to evaluate the extent of liability
coverage, whether the trial was being properly handled, or
whether it should be settled, he said.
   Also named as defendants are Missouri Insurance Guaranty
Association, St. Louis; Transport Indemnity Co., Los Angeles;
Fremont Indemnity Co., Los Angeles; International Insurance
Co., Chicago; Columbia Casualty Co., Chicago; International
Surplus Lines Insurance Co., Chicago; Constitution State
Insurance Co., Hartford; Granite State Insurance Co.,
Manchester, N.H.; and Union Insurance Co., Lincoln, Neb. They
either couldn't be reached or declined comment.
   Attorneys for Allied couldn't be reached for comment.

   A FORMER WEATHER UNDERGROUND radical is helping plan the
ABA's annual meeting.
   Bernardine Dohrn, who won notoriety two decades ago as a
revolutionary leader advocating "armed struggle" against the
U.S. government, will serve as program vice chair for the
American Bar Association's litigation section activities at
the August meeting, to be held in Chicago.
   Ms. Dohrn has been assisting the litigation section
program chairman for nearly a year in organizing panel
discussions and speeches. Topics to be discussed will range
from "The Ethical Example of Sir Thomas More" to "Using
Experts Cost-Effectively in Corporate Litigation."
   Ms. Dohrn spent the 1970s as a fugitive from
law-enforcement authorities. Soon after surfacing in 1980,
she was convicted of misdemeanor assault charges associated
with the 1969 "days of rage" demonstrations in Chicago. She
received a fine and was placed on probation. Ms. Dohrn worked
briefly at the New York office of Sidley &amp; Austin, but moved
to Chicago after her admission to the New York bar was held
up by its character committee. She is currently working in
Cook County's Office of the Public Guardian.
   Litigation program chairwoman Patricia Lee Refo said she
found Ms. Dohrn to be "a very capable person" and "a big help
in putting together the programs."

   THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS hired a law firm on a
contingency fee basis.
   Usually the state pays its outside lawyers on an hourly
basis. However, in a contingency arrangement, five attorneys
from the Boston law firm of Dangel &amp; de Benedictis, will act
as special assistant attorneys general in an asbestos case.
They are representing the state in a suit to recover the
costs of repairing asbestos-contaminated, state-owned
buildings. The defendants are asbestos manufacturers and
distributors. The firm will be paid on a sliding scale of no
more than 30% of the potential recovery, which has been
estimated at more than $100 million, according to a spokesman
for the state attorney general's office.
   The contingency fee arrangement is expected to be cheaper
for the state than hourly payments because if it looses, it
will not pay fees, and will incur no more than $2.5 million
for expenses.

   Economy -- Tracking the Economy:
   Third Reading on First-Period Strength
   In Economy Is Expected to Be Unchanged

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- The third and "final" reading on first-quarter
economic strength is likely to be unchanged, but that's about
where agreement ends.
   Consensus holds that the government's third version of
first-quarter gross national product, due Thursday, will be
unchanged from the 1.3% annual growth rate estimated in May.
Still, many economists expect wrenching revisions in July
when the government tidies up past reports with annual
benchmark and seasonal revisions. What's more, some analysts
disagree on just what GNP numbers mean these days, revised or
not.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The week's other indicators include May housing starts and
building permits, durable goods and personal income and
consumption.
   Real GNP, or the value of the nation's total output of
goods and services, is only one of the indicators whose
reliability has been questioned lately. But it is an
important one because GNP is a critical part of both
policy-making and economic forecasting.
   David B. Bostian Jr., chief economist at Jesup &amp; Lamont
Inc., believes that the "dramatic deterioration" in the
quality of GNP data obscures the fact that "we're in a
recession now." On the other hand, Michael R. Englund,
economist with MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc.,
defends a brighter GNP outlook. He notes that he raised his
second-quarter GNP forecast a bit to 2% from 1.8% Friday
after favorable reports on both May industrial production and
the April trade deficit.
   Mr. Bostian says that recent downward revisions to 1989
data indicate that this past year was weaker than generally
thought. What's more, he adds that revisions to industrial
production dragged the second half of 1989 into negative
territory, and that revised estimates of 1989 wage and salary
income suggest a broad overstatement.
   He believes there's a "50-50 chance" that GNP reports for
both the fourth quarter of 1989 and the first quarter of this
year will be revised to show negative growth. Mr. Bostian
adds that the economy may be close to a "real-time" negative
GNP in the third quarter. Based on recent weak indicators,
including this past week's report on a drop in May retail
sales, he says: "The economy is going to slow down further.
So, we are going to see one or more negative {GNP} numbers."
Mr. Bostian acknowledges that his is one of the more
pessimistic economic views these days.
   A survey of GNP forecasts taken by MMS after Friday's data
were disclosed showed positive, albeit small, growth
forecasts. The consensus view called for GNP growth of 1.5%
in the second quarter, 2.1% in the third quarter, and 1.7% in
the fourth quarter -- all down 0.5 percentage point or less
from the mid-March consensus.
   MMS's Mr. Englund has one of the rosier views. He defends
his outlook by noting that recent, unusually bumpy data only
mask some fundamental, long-term changes in the nature of the
economy. In short, Mr. Englund holds that U.S. economic
strength has been moving geographically to West from East,
spatially to small from big, and sectorally to aerospace from
autos. So, classic indicators like industrial production are
skewed toward large auto makers and tend to undercount the
contribution of smaller companies.
   "The composition of the economy at the end of this
recovery is quite different than at the beginning," says Mr.
Englund.
   Economists are keeping a close eye on consumer spending,
which so far continues to be one of the economy's main
engines. The consensus view on May personal consumption, due
Friday, calls for a small increase of 0.2%, following April's
0.6% gain. Gary Ciminero, economist at Fleet/Norstar
Financial Group, Providence, R.I., says spending on services
probably grew 0.7%, only to be offset by a 0.7% decline in
goods consumption. The consensus view on May personal income
calls for a gain of 0.4%, down slightly from April's gain.
   Economists say durable goods orders in May probably
rebounded with the help of better aircraft orders. The goods
report, due Friday, is expected to show an increase of 2%
following April's 4.3% drop.
   May housing starts, due tomorrow are expected to have
another lackluster month, slowing to an annual pace of 1.22
million units from 1.25 million units the month before.
