   N.V. Philips Unit
   Expects Rebound
   In Second-Half Net

   LONDON -- PolyGram N.V. said it is preparing for several
major recorded-music releases this autumn, bolstering
expectations that the company's earnings will rebound in the
second half.
   PolyGram, which is 80%-owned by N.V. Philips of the
Netherlands, had reported that profit in the first half
dropped 20% to 118 million guilders ($66 million) from 148
million guilders, largely because of the costs of recent
acquisitions. Per-share earnings fell 26% to 69 Dutch cents
from 93 cents, reflecting an increase in the number of shares
outstanding. Sales, however, jumped 25% to a record 2.18
billion guilders from 1.75 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The profit drop had been expected, and analysts predicted
the company will still report an increase in net for the
year. James Golob of S.G. Warburg Securities in London
forecast net income for the year of 370.5 million guilders,
up 11% from 333 million last year.
   David G. Fine, PolyGram's chief executive officer, said in
an interview that the first half was in line with the
company's plan for the year and that prospects for the second
half look strong. He declined to forecast results.
   For the second half, the company plans releases by pop
stars Jon Bon Jovi, Elton John, Van Morrison, Jean Michel
Jarre, INXS and Robert Cray. It also promises several "major
event" recordings, including one based on this summer's
"Wall" concert in Berlin.
   PolyGram had said results were hurt in the half by a drop
in interest income to eight million guilders from 46 million
guilders a year earlier. That decline reflected acquisitions
over the past year of two record companies, Island
International Ltd. and A&amp;M Records Inc. In addition, PolyGram
said, it had to delay releases of new recordings as it
created a new distribution arm in the U.S. to integrate the
acquisitions.
   PolyGram said it benefited strongly from the boom in sales
of classical-music compact disks. The company, whose
classical labels include Decca/London, Deutsche Grammophon
and Philips Classics, estimates its world market share in
classical music is 45%.
   One of PolyGram's biggest sellers in the latest half was
"The Essential Pavarotti," a compilation of arias sung by
Luciano Pavarotti. That recording has sold more than 700,000
copies in Britain alone, giving Mr. Pavarotti what Mr. Fine
called "pop star status."
   "It's become much more fashionable to play classical
music," Mr. Fine said. "It's not fuddy-duddy anymore."

   Noranda Unit Wins
   Ruling in Dispute
   On a Metal Deposit

   MONTREAL -- A Noranda Inc. subsidiary succeeded in
overturning an agreement that would have settled a legal
dispute regarding ownership of a large copper and zinc
deposit in northern Quebec, in which Noranda has an indirect
interest.
   The Supreme Court of Quebec late Wednesday ordered the
owners of the Louvicourt deposit, Aur Resources Inc. and
Louvem Mines Inc., and Louvem's parent, St. Genevieve
Resources Ltd., to cancel the settlement proposal. Lance
Tigert, treasurer of Noranda Minerals Inc., said the court
found that the agreement violated the company's rights under
a shareholder pact with St. Genevieve.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Tigert said Noranda already has begun negotiations
with the other parties to arrive at a new settlement of the
legal dispute. He criticized the earlier accord, to which
Noranda wasn't a party, as being "lopsided."
   The settlement would have given Toronto-based Aur 60% of
Louvicourt, which has been hailed as one of Canada's largest
base-metal discoveries in recent years. Louvem, based in
Montreal, would have kept 40% of the deposit. Louvem is owned
21% by Toronto-based Noranda and 50% by Montreal-based St.
Genevieve.
   Negotiations could bog down on the important issue of who
will operate the mine, with both Noranda and Aur determined
to retain this role.
   Pierre Gauthier, chairman and chief executive officer of
St. Genevieve, said the court also instructed the company to
cancel a notice of sale of 23% of Louvem's shares for a total
of 32.8 million Canadian dollars (US$28.7 million). Noranda
has the right of first refusal on any Louvem shares sold by
St. Genevieve.
   But Mr. Gauthier said St. Genevieve might still seek to
sell part of its Louvem shares -- a move that could pressure
Noranda to agree to a settlement of the legal dispute. Mr.
Gauthier said Noranda would lose the right to veto any
settlement agreement if the combined interests of Noranda and
St. Genevieve in Louvem fell below 50%.

   It's difficult to recognize the real U.S. Air Force and
its secretary, Donald B. Rice, from your July 9 profile of
them. You inaccurately single out the Air Force as the
service most resistant to charge and inattentive to program
management.
   On the one hand, Secretary Rice and the Air Force are
depicted as stubbornly inflexible. Elsewhere, they are
faulted for adjusting priorities and "turning their backs" on
ICBM modernization.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In response to changing global circumstances and budget
realities at home, the Air Force agreed to terminate its
F-15E long-range fighter, cut the B-2 bomber and C-17
airlifter programs sharply, and make major reductions in its
force structure. Your profile, however, does not tell us
about these or other changes.
   You do not mention that the Air Force has been the pace
setter on the Total Force concept, transferring functions
whenever possible to the Guard and the Reserve. We are not
told the Air Force stood second to none in finding economies
called for by the recent Defense Management Review.
   You seem to hold Secretary Rice to account personally for
imputed shortcomings. Few people who have seen this man at
work would ever describe him as a prisoner of the past. In
his 14 months in office, he has already gained a reputation
as a tough-minded activist.

   Just like the boundless vastness of the skies, Air Force
research and development are limitless. This is a challenging
area of imaginative strategies and constant innovation. The
unending evolvement of superior aircraft and the ensuing
conception of effective revolutionary strategies are all
necessary to the formulation of a positive defense -- or, if
necessary, offense.
   The problems faced by Secretary Rice and Gen. Welch and
their associates require support and understanding, not
undeserved fire or the incendiary observations of critics,
which have little substance under scrutiny and are products
of jealous rivalry.
   In this era of high technology, the conception, design,
manufacture and utilization of superior equipment costs a lot
of money. The days of simply making a spear longer or armor
plate thicker are long gone.

   Royal Insurance Posts
   1st-Half Pretax Loss
   Because of Weather

   LONDON -- Royal Insurance Holdings PLC reported a pretax
loss of #65 million ($123.5 million) for the first half,
attributed to heavy weather-related claims. A year earlier,
the company had profit of #119 million.
   The loss was wider than market forecasts, which were #40
million to #60 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite the loss, the large British insurance group said
it would pay an improved interim dividend of 11.25 pence, up
5% from 10.75 pence a year ago.
   The company said that after taxes, less minority
interests, or profit attributable to shareholders, it had a
loss of #46 million, or 9.5 pence a share, compared with
profit of #83 million, or 17.2 pence a share, a year earlier.
   Premium income rose 4%, to #2.49 billion from #2.40
billion.
   Ian Rushton, group chief executive, said the results
"remain dominated by the abnormally high level of world-wide
weather losses." Royal, like most British insurers, suffered
from claims related to wind storms which swept Europe in
January and February, as well as damage from an Australian
flood. He said weather losses totaled #169 million compared
with #47 million a year ago.
   Royal Insurance's U.K. operations reported a pretax loss
of #39 million from a #94 million profit a year ago. The
result was helped by pretax profit of #23 million in the
second quarter.
   The group's U.S. operations continued to show a decline,
bringing a pretax loss of #52 million in the second quarter,
more than double the #25 million loss a year earlier.
   Royal Insurance said the U.S. result "reflects the
industrywide problem" of inadequate insurance costs and
"escalating" costs of losses. Royal Insurance plans to
retreat from unprofitable markets and dispose of noncore
operations to counter the U.S. problems, the company said.
   The company's world-wide operations, which include
Continental Europe and Australia, had a pretax loss of #10
million.
   One analyst said that the size of the company's losses in
the first half means it may make a small pretax loss for the
year. Originally, he had forecast a pretax profit of #34
million for 1990.

   Bush Offers No New Hope on Iraq;
   Two in OPEC to Raise Oil Output

   Saudis, Venezuelans
   Renew Call for Talks,
   Will Offset Oil Loss

<LP>
   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, while renewing a call for an
emergency meeting of oil ministers, said they plan to
increase output with or without OPEC's approval.
   Their idea is to replace much of the four million barrels
of oil a day lost to world markets from the international
embargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes. That, in turn,
would slow the recent runup in petroleum prices, satisfy
pledges made to the Bush administration in regard to the
Middle East crisis and restrict the bold grab by Iran and
some others for former oil customers of Iraq.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The strategy would include a gradual expansion of Saudi
Arabia's output by between 1.5 million and two million
barrels a day and Venezuela's by 500,000 barrels a day. Some
other nations in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries with spare oil capacity also probably would be
involved, including the United Arab Emirates, which could
increase production by 500,000 barrels a day.
   Whatever the decisions, they now are due quickly --
possibly by this weekend. "The situation will be very clear
in a couple of days," a senior OPEC delegate who is close to
developments said yesterday.
   Venezuela has vacillated about filling the supply gap
created by the Middle East crisis, with government officials
in Caracas this week backing away from an earlier promise to
increase exports. Yesterday, however, there were new
indications that Venezuela now will be willing to join Saudi
Arabia and others in pumping more, after all. Saudi Arabia,
widely expected to help offset the deficit early on, hadn't
increased output substantially as it studied the matter.
   It is already obvious that Saudi Arabia and Venezuela
still hope for OPEC's approval -- or at least that of a
majority of OPEC's 13 members -- so that they won't be
accused of unilaterally breaking the group's late-July
agreement limiting production. One formula under discussion
would maintain the OPEC production ceiling at 22.5 million
barrels a day but divide it among 11 nations instead of 13,
ignoring Iraq and Kuwait.
   Celestino Armas, Venezuela's oil minister, is understood
to have forwarded to Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister
and OPEC's president, a strongly worded letter urging again
that a special ministerial meeting be called promptly.
Meanwhile, Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister,
publicly announced that the kingdom also is pressing for an
emergency meeting.
   "Saudi Arabia, with some other member countries of OPEC,
has requested an immediate meeting of the organization in
order to make a joint decision that will deal with the
current situation in the oil market," Mr. Nazer said in a
government statement.
   As expected, the Saudis also rescinded indicated supply
cuts for next month. This week, Saudi Aramco, the national
oil company, has been notifying U.S., European and Japanese
oil companies of volume cuts of 15% to 20% for September
shipments. The Aramco telexes got wide publicity amid
speculation that despite its indicated commitment to increase
production the kingdom was reducing it.
   In Tokyo, Japanese buyers suggested that Saudi Arabia was
aware of the large volume of oil Japan is buying from Iran in
September and was going to supply other companies that had
been cut off from Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes. Among veteran
customers of Saudi Aramco elsewhere the telexes also were
shrugged off. It was assumed that Aramco officials, deluged
by requests for oil in the wake of the Iraq-Kuwait crisis,
were trying to meet needs of old and new customers by
pro-rationing volumes available under their OPEC quota.
   "I think they got requests to supply Kuwait's customers,
including Kuwait Petroleum Co. {operating in exile}, and they
wanted to honor them," said Lawrence Goldstein, president of
the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. But, he added:
"They are still waiting for the king's decision to raise
supply."
   Whatever the reason for the telexes, new ones are going
out quickly. "There is going to be no cut for all our regular
customers," said a Saudi petroleum official.
   Despite the indications that added oil supplies will be
coming into the market soon, petroleum prices rose again
yesterday on increased Middle East tensions. Crude futures
were 60 cents a barrel higher on the London Petroleum
Exchange, and the September crude contract surged 90 cents,
to $27.36, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Also, U.S.
petroleum refiners raised field postings for West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark crude, by 75 cents, to $26 a
barrel.
   Although some OPEC member nations, including Nigeria,
Libya and Iran, already have stepped up production slightly
to take advantage of the sharply higher demand for oil and
the higher prices, those that could really make a difference
have been slow to move. Meanwhile, Iraq, with the support of
its former war foe, Iran, has strongly condemned any
unilateral increases in oil output while its own supplies
remain embargoed.
   As of late yesterday, according to OPEC sources, some
others still remained opposed to any emergency meeting to
consider officially sanctioned production increases. Others
were on the fence, suggesting only that everyone wait a few
days.
   A major obstacle to any meeting of OPEC at this time is
the question of whether Kuwait would be represented and, if
so, by whom. On Aug. 2, Iraq marched in and took over its
neighbor.
   If Kuwait's government-in-exile is counted, however, six,
or possibly a majority of seven, of OPEC's 13 members
yesterday appeared in favor of an early emergency meeting.
"If this fails, or if we reach deadlock, a new avenue has to
be found," said one OPEC delegate, adding: "We feel we have
to act now to stabilize the market."

Americans in Kuwait Increases" -- WSJ Aug. 17, 1989)

   REVIEW &amp; OUTLOOK (Editorial):
   The NEA Wars Continued

   Those still harboring hopes for a healthy and prosperous
future for the National Endowment for the Arts -- and their
numbers are getting fewer -- have less and less reason for
cheer, what with the latest revelations about the log rolling
in the grants process going on at the Endowment. More about
that in a moment. Nor could they have taken much
encouragement from a meeting of the NEA advisory council,
recently convened in Washington to discuss rejected artists,
the specter of government censorship and similar topics dear
to the heart of the arts and grants industry.
   The ensuing three-day fiesta of hand-wringing testimonials
to the sanctity of art and various related sermons and
denunciations amply illustrated why the NEA has come under so
much scrutiny lately. Advisory council member Harvey
Lichtenstein, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music,
charged that the 297 Congressmen who recently voted against
funding the public exhibition of a work displaying
representations of the female sex organs, had been motivated
by homophobia. Other members of the advisory council bitterly
denounced the NEA's refusal to award grants to Holly Hughes
and Karen Finley, both sexually explicit performers. One
speaker was particularly outraged over the agency's failure
to appreciate the art of Ms. Finley, known for on-stage
performances in which she smears chocolate and bean sprouts
over her mostly naked body while inveighing against various
forms of political and social repression in this country.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But in the midst of their struggles to defend art against
the Philistine hordes, the council members also found time to
acknowledge that the NEA has developed an image problem over
conflict of interest charges. We suspect this is the ticking
time bomb most likely to blow apart the entire NEA
enterprise.
   The fact that NEA judges sit on the very panels that make
grants to their own organizations has long been something of
an inside joke within the arts-grants community. The manager
of the San Francisco Opera, for example, sat on the panels
that awarded grants of $175,000 and $27,000 to none other
than the San Francisco Opera. The director of Philadelphia's
Institute of Contemporary Art sat on the panels that gave
grants totaling $155,000 to Philadelphia's Institute of
Contemporary Art. The curator of the New Museum of
Contemporary Art in New York sat on the panel that gave
$97,000 in grants to the New Museum of Contemporary Art. And
so on.
   A spokesman for the Endowment told us that panel members
were always careful to leave the room when their
institutions's grants were about to be voted on. Those who
know the way the NEA panels work scoff. Absent members know
full well that they can depend on colleagues and the favor
exchange that operates among the panelists.
   At its meeting, the NEA advisory council postponed voting
funds for Karen Finley and Holly Hughes only because of the
appearance of conflict of interest charges. Both these
performers were asking funds for projects directly involving
panel members who were to vote on the funding. Their grants
are to be submitted to a new panel, to meet in November,
safely after the time Congress makes its decision on
re-authorizing the Endowment.
   Still, we can be grateful that the NEA's advisors have
seen fit to concern themselves with at least this aspect of
the Endowment's credibility problem. Cooperative
back-scratching that prevents equitable distribution of
grants has after all a lot to do with the issue of fair play
for artists. Perhaps the arts community now busy
demonstrating around the country with "art ambulances,"
symbolic coffins and freedom of expression caravans to garner
support for the NEA will find a minute to take note of that
fact. Surely, there is something improper about the manner in
which the "arts community" has kept these public funds
circulating in a narrow circle of like-minded artists with
well-placed friends.

   Gorbachev, Yeltsin Are Making Effort
   To End Discord Over Economic Reform

<LP>
   MOSCOW -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and the
leader of the vast Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, are
cutting their travels short in an effort to halt internal
battles that threaten plans for economic reform.
   Mr. Yeltsin broke off a working tour of Russia and
returned to Moscow Wednesday. Yesterday, the official Tass
news agency quoted Mr. Yeltsin as saying Mr. Gorbachev will
return to Moscow from his holiday in Crimea in the next few
days.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Yeltsin has long been urging more radical reforms than
those proposed by the central government. Earlier this month,
Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin agreed to create a joint team
to work out a new proposal for shifting to a market economy,
based on a more radical plan created by the Russian
government. The agreement was a direct slap at Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov, who is leading a central government effort
at planning economic reform.
   Mr. Ryzhkov's most recent proposal, presented in May,
failed to win the parliament's approval because it was
indecisive and would have started with an unpopular immediate
rise in retail bread prices. The government was given until
September to work out something better.
   The new joint-team has been working in parallel to Mr.
Ryzhkov's committee and another so-called alternative
commission, and all three are racing to come up with draft
plans for the Soviet and Russian parliaments to discuss next
month. Now Mr. Gorbachev is under increasing pressure to
choose between his prime minister's more moderate reforms and
an alliance with the radical populist, Mr. Yeltsin.
   Mr. Yeltsin indirectly criticized Mr. Ryzhkov for
undermining the new team's efforts. According to Tass, he
complained that the Federal ministries of defense and finance
weren't giving the group certain essential data, defying
presidential instructions to cooperate by doing so. He called
for the government to abandon its parallel reform planning.
"One should not duplicate work," he said. "It is necessary to
concentrate on our program, which is trusted by the people
and is both novel and realistic," he said.
   Indicating that his intentions to cooperate only go so
far, Mr. Yeltsin threatened that Russia will take its own
course, no matter what. If the Soviet parliament is presented
with two official proposals, he said, "The Russian parliament
will adopt its own plan and the issue will be closed."
   In his own republic, which covers the bulk of Soviet
territory, Mr. Yeltsin has supported plans and declarations
that directly contradict the rule of the central government.
Various republics are seeking direct ties with one another as
a way to achieve economic improvements faster than waiting
for central government reform. Whatever economic reform
program the government adopts this autumn will be crucial in
Mr. Gorbachev's struggle to keep testy republics interested
in remaining part of a unified nation.
   Some political analysts say the decision to create a joint
team reflected how weak Mr. Gorbachev is becoming, while
others say the president intends to use Mr. Yeltsin's
pressure to push through reforms he himself thinks are
necessary. In any case, Mr. Gorbachev can only be helped if
he wins the support of Mr. Yeltsin, among the most popular
politicians in Russia.
   So far the Soviet government has resisted taking radical
steps that might cause immediate sharp inflation or
unemployment. The plan presented by Mr. Ryzhkov in May was
scheduled to take three to five years, and to start with
price reform. The Russian 500-day plan takes about 18 months
and emphasizes privatization of huge state-run industries.
Local news reports indicate that the various economic reform
commissions are now scrapping the idea of starting with price
reform in favor of starting with privatization.
   Mr. Yeltsin said he was hopeful that the new group will be
able to complete its work this month, according to Tass. He
said that yesterday the team agreed on a package of emergency
measures to help limit the chaos of a transition to a market
economy.

   Enterprise -- Talking Strategy:
   Many Entrepreneurs Turn Their Old Firms Into Clients
   ---
   They Often Sell Services to the
   Specific Operations They Left
   ----

   Leaving the corporate womb to start your own business is
scary. But many who try it discover that one of the best ways
to soften the shock is to turn their old employers into
assets.
   For instance, after 32 years at International Business
Machines Corp., Robert Bettendorf accepted an
early-retirement offer last year. He started his own
business, but he hasn't stopped doing work for IBM. Instead,
he made the computer giant his first client.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In his last IBM job, Mr. Bettendorf ran an office that
concentrated on the safety and comfort of IBM products. IBM
hired his new concern, Institute of Office Technology Inc.,
Stamford, Conn., to study the health effects of office
equipment. "I was creating a gap at the company which I was
able to fill," he explains.
   Mr. Bettendorf knew before he started his company that he
would get some work from IBM. "Without those assurances, I
might well have gone out and done something else." IBM still
accounts for more than 50% of his business, but he hopes to
reduce his dependency on the corporation through a
combination of seminars and independent consulting
assignments.
   Many executives at big companies such as IBM yearn to
start their own businesses. In addition, recent mergers,
acquisitions and cutbacks at companies have forced numerous
others to start new careers. Increasingly, they choose
self-employment. Joseph Jannotta, chairman of Jannotta, Bray
&amp; Associates, an executive placement firm in Chicago, says
that 16% of the laid-off employees whom his firm helps find
work end up as entrepreneurs, compared with only 4% in 1980.
   New entrepreneurs frequently find there are many ways that
their old employers can help them in new ventures. Take
Harlan Jessup, who has left General Electric Co. twice.
   In 1979, a midlife crisis led him to open a sporting-goods
retail store in Southbury, Conn. The venture failed, and Mr.
Jessup was back with GE by March 1980. On New Year's Day this
year, Mr. Jessup was on his own again. But this time he
couldn't turn back: His division was being phased out. Like
Mr. Bettendorf, he started his own business and turned his
old company into his first client.
   But this was just the beginning. More importantly, he
says, GE allowed him to use the training materials he had
developed while he worked at the company. These form an
essential part of the service that his consulting concern,
TeamWork Management, offers. "Developing new materials would
have been an overwhelming task," he says.
   GE also allowed Mr. Jessup to spend the three months
between accepting the early-retirement program and leaving GE
on developing his new business. He printed a brochure and
developed a mailing-list during that time. Mr. Jessup now
operates his business from his home in Newtown, Conn.,
helping to develop "self-directed work teams" -- groups of
employees that plan and measure their own work -- for four
divisions of GE.
   Now Mr. Jessup is looking to expand his client base. He
thinks he can achieve this through a series of public
workshops he has planned for the end of the year.
   Of course, entrepreneurs who turn employers into clients
realize they can become too dependent on a single company.
The relationship can have other pitfalls, too, warn business
owners such as Jeffrey Hartnell. He left Ross Laboratories, a
unit of Abbott Laboratories Inc., to buy into an advertising
agency that now works predominantly for pharmaceutical
companies. He believes that "once you leave your employer's
door, you have to be careful about how you come back and
knock on it."
   Mr. Hartnell says that after he left Ross in 1986, he was
afraid of becoming involved in questions of confidentiality.
For two years, therefore, he steered clear of the areas he
had specialized in while an employee of Ross, working instead
for packaged-goods pharmaceutical concerns.
   Now his agency, Martcom Inc., does 20 to 25 projects a
year for Ross. "They can be confident now that I won't be a
security problem for them," he says.
   While many departing employees find ways to get help from
their old employers, the companies sometimes take the
initiative, too. For five years before retirement and three
years afterward, IBM employees are eligible for reimbursement
of as much as $5,000 for the cost of education. Some
employees have used the plan to take courses in subjects such
as accounting, which help them in starting up their own
businesses, says Kenneth Johnson, manager of the retirement
and capital accumulation programs at IBM.
   Sometimes, companies even provide employees with the
business itself. When Allied-Signal Inc. decided to disband
its corporate new ventures group in July 1986, it couldn't
find a place for one venture that it had been developing for
almost 10 years. So it offered the unit to a group of
employees led by Stephen Fields, who had been developing its
main product for several years, time-sensitive and
temperature-sensitive labels for food products. Allied
offered to pay Mr. Fields and five other employees their
regular salaries while they raised the necessary money.
   One year later, in August 1987, Allied-Signal sold the
unit, now called LifeLines Technology Inc., for $2 million to
a consortium consisting of venture capital groups, the six
employees and Allied-Signal.
   Mr. Fields says going out on his own would have been
impossible without the support of Allied-Signal, which has
continued to provide funding. Besides, he says, "this isn't
the kind of business you could start from scratch." He claims
that the almost 10 years of research into the innovative
product wouldn't have been possible outside of a corporation.
   Mr. Fields says entrepreneurship suits him fine. "I get to
control my destiny to a much greater extent than I would in a
corporation," he says. He thinks that the entrepreneurial
approach also makes the company run more effectively, too.
"We're all trying to make money, so there's a real
singularity of purpose."
   On top of all this, Mr. Fields says the new owners have
since received offers of more than $10 million for the
company.

   James River Announces Restructuring,
   Will Sell Some Assets, Refocus Business

   James River Corp. said it will sell or shut down
operations with annual sales of $1.3 billion, nearly a fourth
of the paper company's revenue, after other efforts "failed"
to improve financial performance.
   In connection with the restructuring, the Richmond, Va.,
company will post a charge against earnings of $140 million
to $150 million, or $1.71 to $1.84 a share, which analysts
say will result in a loss of more than $1 a share for the
first quarter, ended July 29. In the year-earlier period, the
company earned $57 million, or 64 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   James River said it will use the proceeds of the sales to
reduce debt and buy back as many as 8 million shares. The
company also intends to make major capital investments in its
remaining businesses to better compete with the larger, more
efficient machines of such competitors as Scott Paper Co. and
Fort Howard Corp.
   Analysts said that the moves are a solid first step in
improving shareholder value. "Long term, I think this is very
positive for earnings, financial returns and the stock
price," said Jeanne Carroll of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   The company has made small moves to focus on its more
profitable businesses over the last year. But Brenton S.
Halsey, chairman and chief executive officer, told
stockholders at the annual meeting yesterday in Richmond that
more radical change was necessary. "Our team has been unable
to find a satisfactory approach to getting back on track --
other than changing the structure of our business," Mr.
Halsey said in prepared remarks.
   Mr. Halsey said the company needs to boost its return on
equity to 16%, from the 10% range where it has hovered for
the last five years.
   The restructuring plan, to be implemented over one year,
could well move James River toward that goal, analysts said.
But James River still has a long way to go to match the
efficiency of its competitors. "Even after they sell these
assets, the company doesn't have the best mills," said George
Adler of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "They still need to
spend money to upgrade them."
   Indeed, James River said it will spend $97 million to
double the capacity of paperboard machines at Kalamazoo,
Mich., and an undisclosed amount on 12 other major projects.
   But Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said the new expenses and
stock buy-back could affect James River's ability to repay
about $750 million of the company's $1.77 billion in
long-term debt. S&amp;P warned that it may downgrade its ratings
on the company's debt, though Moody's Investors Service Inc.
confirmed its current ratings.
   Much depends on the price fetched by the business on the
block; the paper industry is in a cyclical slump, and it is
unclear how much James River could get. The planned
divestitures involve 28 mills.
   James River noted that it has already made progress on the
asset sales, which will affect about 7,300 employees out of a
total of 37,000. The company said it signed a letter of
intent to sell 80% of the Specialty Industrial Papers unit,
with about $600 million in sales, to a new company controlled
by AEA Investors Inc. and a management group headed by James
E. Rogers, the group executive who currently runs the
division. The company said it also signed a letter of intent
to sell its West Linn, Ore., mill, which makes coated paper,
to Simpson Paper Co.
   The company will then be able to focus its money and
attention on four core businesses: towels and tissues, Dixie
food-service products, food and consumer packaging, and paper
used in printing and publishing.
   James River announced the restructuring after the stock
market closed yesterday. In composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, the company's shares closed at $22.875, down
25 cents.

   In Cincinnati House Contest, GOP Takes Aim
   At Elusive Goal: Victory for a Black Republican

<LP>
   CINCINNATI -- The Republican Party has lately been sending
a campaign armada through this riverfront city. Jack Kemp and
Dan Quayle have steamed through; Oliver North and, possibly,
George Bush, are on the way.
   Their goal -- to elect a Republican to Congress -- isn't
unusual, but their vessel is: The candidate, Ken Blackwell,
is a black conservative.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For decades, Republicans have had little success extending
their influence into the black community. Indeed, no black
Republican has been elected to the House as a voting member
since GOP Rep. Oscar De Priest of Chicago, who was unseated
in 1934 by Republican-turned-New-Deal-Democrat Arthur
Mitchell (himself the first black Democrat elected to
Congress).
   This year, the party is attempting to turn that historical
tide with three black candidates for the House: Gary Franks,
a Waterbury, Conn., alderman pitted against former Rep. Toby
Moffett; Al Brown, a Louisville, Ky., businessman challenging
Rep. Romano Mazzoli; and Mr. Blackwell, a former Cincinnati
mayor and, until last March, a deputy undersecretary at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development under Mr. Kemp.
Of the three, it is Mr. Blackwell -- who blends opposition to
taxes, gay rights and abortion with support for affirmative
action -- who excites conservative activists the most.
   To win, he must beat a formidable opponent: Charles Luken,
the current mayor of Cincinnati and son of the popular,
conservative Democratic incumbent. When Rep. Tom Luken
announced in January that he wouldn't seek another term,
Charles Luken was judged a shoo-in to succeed him. Convinced
by Ohio Republicans that Mr. Blackwell was the man to beat
Charles Luken, Washington party officials recruited the HUD
official for the job. He declared his candidacy, returned to
Cincinnati in March, and now finds himself in a very close
race.
   Mr. Blackwell has traveled a unique route to his current
candidacy. A student activist and president of the
African-American Student Association at Cincinnati's Xavier
University in the 1960s, Mr. Blackwell agitated for more
courses in black studies and more minority hires. After a
brief professional football stint with the Dallas Cowboys,
Mr. Blackwell became an administrator and psychology teacher
at Xavier, then ran for city council on the reformist
Charterite ticket in 1977.
   As late as 1980, Mr. Blackwell was a strong supporter of
Jimmy Carter; at one news conference, he joined several urban
politicians in denouncing Ronald Reagan as a "disaster" for
urban America. One year later, however, Mr. Blackwell left
the city's Charter Party to become a Republican and committed
Reagan supporter. A leading catalyst in persuading him to
make the switch was Jack Kemp, whom he met at a National
Football League function in 1979. "Kemp was constantly
sending me speeches and working papers," Mr. Blackwell
recalls as he sits in a quiet corner of Cincinnati's
walnut-paneled Queen City Club, where he is waiting to meet
two business-community supporters. When Mr. Kemp became HUD
secretary, he brought his protege to Washington.
   Today, Mr. Blackwell styles himself as a social and
economic conservative. He's a supply-side true believer,
advocating a cut in capital-gains taxes to 15% from as much
as 33%. Limiting taxation is the "best way to check the size
of government," Mr. Blackwell says. At HUD, he was a strong
advocate for tenant purchase and ownership of public housing
as a means of "empowerment" for the poor.
   Mr. Blackwell takes a hard-right line on most social
issues as well. He opposes legalized abortion, and led a
successful city council crusade to require local hospitals to
provide for "humane" disposal of fetuses such as burial or
incineration. (The measure was subsequently struck down in
federal court.) He opposes the civil-rights bill currently
being constructed by Congress, arguing it amounts to "quota
legislation." But he still maintains he's for affirmative
action when it's "legitimate and fair."
   Democratic candidate Charles Luken is campaigning as a
conservative too, opposing abortion and favoring a cut in
capital-gains taxes to 22%. In an ironic twist, Mr. Luken
positions himself as the anti-Washington figure in this
contest, despite the fact that his father served eight terms
in Congress and has long been a major recipient of
special-interest campaign contributions.
   Both candidates will spend a lot of money as fat-cat
contributors and special interests line up to donate in a
close race with no incumbent. Mr. Blackwell says he already
has raised almost half of his $750,000 target and last month
began running a television ad touting his rise from
"working-class origins" to membership in the Bush
administration.
   Although the elder Mr. Luken has held this seat since
1976, the district, which includes suburbs as well as the
western part of Cincinnati, is more a Republican one; George
Bush won with 63% of the vote in 1988. In a reversal of the
usual calculus, it's the black candidate who expects his
strongest showing in the suburbs, home to German-Catholic
Republicans who long ago abandoned Cincinnati's
"Over-the-Rhine" neighborhood. "Good luck to you," chirps one
elderly white man as Mr. Blackwell passes out refrigerator
magnets in front of the Green Township Thriftway.
   But Mr. Blackwell also hopes to split the black vote --
somewhere around 15% -- despite his Republican label. Ed
Brookover, regional field representative for the National
Republican Congressional Committee, contends that Mr.
Blackwell has the ability to "connect with the black
community while representing the strong conservative values
that our party stands for."
   Not surprisingly, however, the GOP candidate's
conservatism rankles some of the city's black leaders. "He
votes against the interests of his own community," complains
Marian Spencer, a Charterite and former city council member
who attributes Mr. Blackwell's party switch to opportunism.
And he's taking flack for his association with Oliver North,
who reportedly will be paid $8,000 to come in to stump for
the Republican contender. Charterite City Councilman Reggie
Williams -- a former starting linebacker for the Cincinnati
Bengals and someone who has been wooed by national
Republicans, too -- draws a pointed parallel: "I remember
when Sammy Davis was embracing Richard Nixon. That turned a
few stomachs."
   But Councilman Williams still is leaning toward supporting
Mr. Blackwell, and the conservative black congressional
candidate doesn't seem in a mood to trim his sails. For
instance, he rejects the "bleeding-heart conservative" label
attached to his mentor, Jack Kemp, explaining that on certain
issues such as organized labor, "Kemp is to the left of me."

   President Bush and Jordan's King Hussein appeared to make
little progress toward resolving the U.S. showdown with Iraq,
and even as they talked, fears grew about the fate of
Americans under Iraqi control.
   The Jordanian monarch, a neighbor and friend of Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein, visited President Bush for two hours
at the president's Maine vacation home in hope of defusing
the military tension that has been building since Iraq
invaded Kuwait. The king indicated that Amman generally
intends to abide by international sanctions against Iraq by
choking the flow of Iraqi goods through the Jordanian port of
Aqaba. But neither he nor President Bush expressed any
optimism about a negotiated end to the crisis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I did not come away from that conversation with any
feeling of hope that Saddam Hussein would do that which he's
been called upon to do under international law," Mr. Bush
said.
   For his part, King Hussein said he was "leaving with a
clearer idea of what the president's thinking is." But he
acknowledged that there hadn't been any breakthrough. At one
point in a brief exchange with reporters, he seemed almost
fatalistic as he pledged to continue trying to bring his U.S.
and Iraqi friends together.
   "I suppose one has to have hope," he said. "Without hope
you can't get anywhere. And the dangers are such that it's
unthinkable to contemplate the idea of giving up and not
trying one's best to resolve this problem to the satisfaction
of all." The king denied persistent reports that he carried a
specific message or negotiating proposal from Saddam Hussein.
   Separately, a senior Jordanian official told reporters
that Jordan doesn't intend to condone Iraq's occupation or
annexation of Kuwait. He said Jordan's low-key response to
Baghdad's moves, which has been so mild as to anger U.S.
officials, was designed to keep alive King Hussein's efforts
to reverse Iraqi policy. He suggested the king's effort was
derailed by the rapid international diplomatic and military
response that escalated tensions.
   While prospects for a diplomatic resolution of the crisis
remained weak, the outlook also grew dimmer for the quick
departure of Americans who have been stuck in Iraq and Kuwait
since the invasion. In a move that troubled Bush
administration officials, Iraqis overseeing the occupation of
Kuwait declared that the estimated 2,500 Americans in Kuwait
should gather at a Kuwaiti hotel. The officials issued a
similar demand for British citizens.
   By gathering these foreign nationals in one spot, Iraqi
authorities would increase their control over them. The order
raised fears that the Americans and Britons in Kuwait might
be moved to Iraq.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Iraqi
authorities told the U.S. ambassador to Kuwait, Nathaniel
Howell, that the Americans were being gathered to protect
them from some unspecified threat, and they asked him for
compliance within two hours. The ambassador replied that he
would inform Americans but couldn't order them to move. He
protested the demand.
   A senior State Department official said the Iraqi
commander who conveyed the order hinted to the ambassador
that if Americans didn't comply, he would send his troops out
to round them up.
   President Bush tried to avoid escalating U.S. rhetoric
about the Americans, arguing that "it's more dangerous, I
think, if I heighten the concern." But he said the order for
Americans to gather was a "violation of international norms"
and added: "Anything that compels individuals to do anything
against their will would, of course, concern me."
   Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein issued another statement,
calling Mr. Bush and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak "liars"
and warning that if the U.S. persists, "you are going to
receive some American bodies in bags." The Iraqi leader also
said that for the U.S. to demand that he withdraw from Kuwait
is like Iraq demanding that the U.S. "withdraw from the
southern states in the United States."
   While Iraq has sent hints in recent days that it's
interested in negotiating about its occupation of Kuwait, Mr.
Bush continues to show little interest in holding such talks.
King Hussein, after his meeting with President Bush, said
their discussion was "open" and "candid," words that suggest
the talk was blunt.
   King Hussein did please U.S. officials by suggesting that
Jordan is observing U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq and
won't serve as a conduit for goods heading to Iraq in
violation of the U.N.-ordered embargo. Just three days ago,
President Bush threatened to stop ships going into Jordan's
only port, Aqaba, if their cargo is destined for Iraq.
   Later, the Pentagon formally announced the procedures U.S.
warships will follow to prevent civilian vessels from picking
up or delivering shipments to Iraq and Kuwait. The decision,
which had been expected but wasn't spelled out until
yesterday, authorizes the U.S. Navy to interdict cargo ships
by warning them to stop, searching them for materials covered
by United Nations sanctions and using "the minimal amount of
force necessary" to divert the vessels to other ports.
   The Jordanian port of Aqaba is explicitly included in the
"primary area of operation" in the Persian Gulf, Gulf of
Oman, and the Red Sea announced by the Pentagon.
   During his discussion, King Hussein also told Secretary of
State James Baker that Jordan is seeking a ruling from the
United Nations about whether food shipments would be allowed
under its sanctions resolution, which allows shipments of
goods for undefined humanitarian reasons. Referring to food
shipments, King Hussein said: "I believe there are certain
categories or areas where the situation is unclear."
   Taken together, the comments suggest that Jordan intends
to follow the trade embargo voted by the U.N. in response to
Baghdad's military takeover of Kuwait but also wants to
please Iraq by exploiting any loopholes considered legally
acceptable.
   President Bush suggested that he was generally, but not
totally, satisfied with Jordan's position, saying
"differences that possibly existed with Jordan have been
narrowed."
   Mr. Bush also showed little concern about Iraq's attempt
this week to settle its differences with Iran, a step some
analysts said could ease military pressure on Baghdad and
lead to economic cooperation between the two states. He
expressed pleasure that Iran, which fought an eight-year war
with Iraq that ground to a halt only two years ago, continues
to criticize the Iraqi invasion.
   After King Hussein left the presidential retreat, Mr. Bush
met with Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al Faisal. The Saudi
official later said the U.S. decision to offer troops to
defend Saudi Arabia against possible further Iraqi military
moves "will long be remembered." He asserted that the next
move in the standoff is up to Iraq and said, "What we are
hoping for is for Iraq to respond to international will and
Arab will."
   Separately, a senior Jordanian official suggested that
abiding by U.N. sanctions is particularly important to Jordan
because of Amman's own insistence that the Israeli-occupied
West Bank be returned to it under a 23-year-old U.N.
resolution.
   The official also said that Iraq's move into Kuwait may
have represented a "miscalculation" by Saddam Hussein, who
probably didn't anticipate the international response it has
aroused. But the Jordanian urged the U.S. to avoid a similar
miscalculation and refrain from military hostilities with
Iraq. He said a military fight "in the long run is going to
be a major disaster, and mostly for you, the U.S." because it
would incite radicals and Islamic fundamentalists throughout
the Middle East.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   U.S. to Remove
   Some Trade Curbs
   With Austria

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. will extend to Austria nearly the
same privileges in high-technology trade that it gives its
European and Pacific allies, the Commerce Department said.
   The department granted Austria the new status after being
assured that the country is satisfactorily enforcing export
controls established by its revised foreign trade law. Until
now, Switzerland, Finland, Sweden and Singapore have been the
only neutral countries enjoying most of the export-licensing
benefits that the U.S. normally accords its allies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. move will allow U.S. vendors to ship
higher-quality computers and other electronics products to
Austria without a license. U.S. exporters also will be
allowed to ship large numbers of even higher-level computers
under single distribution licenses. Austria, moreover, will
gain the right to import the most advanced U.S. mainframes
without licensing paperwork, provided the equipment is bought
by state-controlled enterprises and will remain on the
enterprises' own premises.
   Austrian diplomats welcomed the U.S. action, asserting
that the new trade privileges will enhance Vienna's effort to
attract U.S. companies interested in establishing European
regional headquarters with sophisticated computer
capabilities.
   The U.S. granted Austria somewhat lesser benefits in 1987,
shortly after Vienna began requiring export permits for
certain strategic goods that previously had crossed its
borders freely. But the U.S. said at the time that it would
withhold other benefits until it was satisfied that Austria's
busy free-free zones were being adequately policed.
   Austria's new status also allows it to freely export to
Western Europe, Japan and Australia computers containing most
kinds of U.S.-made semiconductors and other components.
Previously, Austrian computer makers have been required in
many instances to get U.S. permission to export products
containing such U.S. parts.

   Each ADR will represent one underlying share and will
trade in the over-the-counter market quoted in the so-called

   Everyone once knew that the affairs of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) were managed from that ancient
red-brick fortress called the Kremlin. Now it is not so
clear.
   If you wander along the Moscow River from the Kremlin you
come to the gleaming, socialist-modern capitol of the Russian
Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (R.S.F.S.R.), better
known as Russia. The R.S.F.S.R. has just issued a decree
asserting that its laws supersede those of the U.S.S.R.
Foreign firms were left guessing which one controls trade and
resources.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   DeBeers Centenary A.G., a Swiss firm set up earlier this
year by DeBeers Consolidated Mines, Ltd., is caught in the
middle. Its mission was to lasso independent diamond
marketers and haul them into the DeBeers cartel, restoring
DeBeers's global monopoly. DeBeers Centenary thought it had a
major coup last month in signing a contract with a U.S.S.R.
agency called Glavalmazzoto to buy $5 billion in Russian
diamonds over the next five years. But after the R.S.F.S.R.
sovereignty decree, the chairman of the legislative committee
of the Russian parliament said the contract was invalid. Only
Russia can sell Russian diamonds, he asserted.
   The official, Sergei Shakhrai, also threatened punishment
for writing contracts outside Russian law. Presumably, folks
at Glavalmazzoto could be shipped to Russian Siberia to
personally dig gems out of the frozen ground while reflecting
on the sin of not knowing who was boss.
   DeBeers doesn't seem overly concerned and maybe the rivals
will meet halfway, somewhere along the Moscow River, to
compromise. But meanwhile, creditors to the
U.S.S.R.-R.S.F.S.R. have a right to be nervous. A compromise
on who owns resources wouldn't necessarily cover who's
responsible for foreign debt. With the U.S.S.R.-R.S.F.S.R.
economy tottering, gold and diamonds are much in demand as
collateral for that debt.
   There is a solution: Privatize Glavalmazzoto (and maybe
give it a new name). Then neither Moscow would own the
resources. But don't hold your breath.

Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro.
   The California facility was closed yesterday, putting
about 3,500 employees out of work. It will reopen Monday.

   The Flint walkout, which ended Aug. 13, caused GM to shut

   MANY computers in the future may look more like a Post-it
note than like today's familiar desktop machine.
   Researchers at Xerox's Silicon Valley laboratories are
devising prototype computers that seek to mimic low-tech
tools such as note pads and blackboards. Xerox argues that
these mundane items have proven the most efficient tools for
getting the job done.
   For starters, Xerox says it has built a prototype the size
of a pad of Post-it notes, with a liquid crystal screen on
which the user writes text. The pad includes a transmitter
that can zap the writing to other computer tablets ranging in
size from the notes to legal pads and blackboards.
   In Xerox's futuristic vision, which it calls "ubiquitous
computing," an average executive in the mid-1990s would have
a dozen note-sized computers scattered around the office for
quick memos. Legal-pad-sized machines would be stacked on
desks and in conference rooms for note-taking and financial
calculations. The desktop machine would still be there, Xerox
says, but many of its functions would be usurped by the
inexpensive paper-mimicking computers. "We're taking life as
it is and computerizing it," says a Xerox research manager.
   Rapidly shrinking computer chips and recent advances in
handwriting recognition from companies such as Tandy's Grid
Systems unit lend some credence to Xerox's model. Moreover,
Xerox's lab, where engineers and sociologists gaze into
crystal balls together, has been right before. In the
mid-1970s, it came up with ideas that eventually made their
way into the Apple Macintosh.
                                                                                                       

   Weather Nuts With PCs
   Can Chart Fronts Galore
                                                                                                       

   WHO NEEDS the evening news weatherman when a meteorologist
lurks in every personal computer?
   A modem and a piece of software turn a PC into a weather
machine that phones up a central weather-data computer and
translates the data into weather maps and charts on the
screen. One such program, WeatherBrief from the Mindscape
unit of Software Toolworks, Chatsworth, Calif., dials up a
weather computer in Salt Lake City used by newspapers and TV
forecasters.
   To save phone charges, the $50 program prompts the user to
type out a shopping list of weather information ahead of
time. The program automatically dials up, obtains data, hangs
up and converts numbers into charts and maps.
   One day in July, for instance, a $1.98 phone call using
the program showed a 37% chance of rain in Oklahoma City,
soil temperature of 69 degrees in Chicago and 117-degree heat
in Kuwait. The call also generated computer maps of weather
fronts, cloud cover, lightning strikes and a satellite photo
of hurricanes Hernan and Iselle just off Mexico.
   Another Software Toolworks program, Accu-Weather
Forecaster, lets PCs dial into AccuWeather's database to
create graphs and maps. One feature creates a "window" on the
screen that simulates the weather as seen out the window at
any of 1,000 weather stations. Users of the $80 program
include transportation firms, "weather hobbyists" and
nudists, the company says.
                                                                                                       

   Tiny Gadgets Measure
   Cholesterol at Home
                                                                                                       

   CONSUMERS soon will be able to stay up to the minute on
their cholesterol readings.
   MediSense, Cambridge, Mass., is designing pen-sized
gadgets that let users measure their own cholesterol levels
much as diabetics measure their blood glucose. Until now,
cholesterol testing required technicians using expensive
typewriter-sized lab machines. MediSense's testers, which it
plans to unveil as early as next year probably for less than
$200, use "biosensors" -- electrodes that combine electronics
and an organic material ferrocene -- to measure cholesterol.
   MediSense won't discuss details of its pens, which still
need regulatory approval. But it says the gadget will shrink
the innards of a bigger model -- the size of a desk
calculator -- that it will place in pharmacies this fall. "A
person picking up toothpaste can get his cholesterol checked
right on the spot," a MediSense official says.
   With both models, a customer uses a disposable
finger-pricking device and places a blood drop on the
biosensor embedded in a paper strip. The blood's cholesterol
molecules react with chemicals in the paper, creating a faint
current that the sensor measures in about 20 seconds,
compared with the five minutes needed by conventional
equipment.
   The tester meets federal guidlines for accuracy, says
MediSense, which hopes for a replay of the success of its
pen-sized testing devices used by diabetics. The company also
says it's studying uses of biosensors to test blood levels of
drugs and alcohol.

   Typists Sick of `Mice'
   Get a Reprieve From `J'
                                                                                                       

   HERE'S RELIEF for mouse haters.
   Accomplished touch-typists often dislike the computer
"mouse" -- the device that is rolled around on the desktop to
manipulate the screen's pointer -- because a hand on the
mouse means a hand off the keyboard. Home Row, Clackamas,
Ore., has a tiny gadget that converts the keyboard's "J" key
into a surrogate mouse when the typist holds down the "alt"
key.
   The typist pushes the J slightly forward, backward or
sideways, and a "force sensor" hiding under the key's cap
detects the movement and translates it into a cursor
movement. Releasing the alt key returns the J to normal.
   Home Row has licensed its technology to keyboard maker Key
Tronic, Spokane, Wash., which says it expects a market among
laptop-computer makers.

   Hewlett-Packard
   Reports 5% Drop
   In 3rd-Quarter Net
   ----

   Hewlett-Packard Co., citing stiff competition and cuts in
defense spending, reported a 5% drop in net income for its
third quarter ended July 31.
   The Palo Alto, Calif., maker of computers and electronic
instruments posted net of $178 million, or 73 cents a share,
compared with $187 million, or 79 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. Analysts expected HP to earn about 80
cents a share. Revenue for the quarter increased 8% to $3.2
billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   HP said its results were hurt by weaker spending in
defense, aerospace and health services and by loss of market
share in personal computers and workstations, where
competition is fierce and HP's offerings lately have lagged
the industry.
   In response, analysts cut slightly estimates for HP's
fourth quarter and fiscal 1991 earnings, but said they were
pleased with the company's efforts to hold down increases in
operating expenses, which grew 6% in the third quarter.
   "Expenses were the upside surprise," said Steven
Milunovich, an analyst at First Boston Corp. "They're doing
the job there."
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, HP's stock fell $1.875 a share to close at $35.875
a share.
   However, growth in orders for the quarter slowed, with
orders rising 9% from the year-earlier period to $3.3
billion. The company's growth in orders is generally higher.
The sluggishness "led us to view the months ahead with
caution," said John Young, HP's chief executive, in a
prepared statement.
   While part of the slowdown is due to global economic
factors, the company's difficulties in PCs and workstations
-- two expanding markets -- are especially worrisome. Last
year, the company became the biggest supplier of
workstations, desktop computers used by engineers and
scientists, after purchasing Apollo Computer Inc. But this
year Sun Microsystems Inc. has overtaken HP, which is in a
battle for second place with Digital Equipment Corp.
   Mr. Young, in an interview earlier this week, vowed that
"Sun isn't going to run away with this marketplace" and that
the company planned to introduce more competitive models
later this year.
   In PCs, HP had been gaining momentum in recent years, so
the slowdown here is a surprise. While the company has never
broken out of the "second tier" of PC suppliers, it hopes to
win important niche markets with new models based on Intel
Corp.'s state-of-the-art 486 microprocessor. But sales of
those models are disappointing, company officials told
analysts.
   To counter slippage in PCs, Mr. Young yesterday named
Jacques Clay as the PC group's new chief and said the group's
headquarters will move from Sunnyvale, Calif., to Grenoble,
France, where Mr. Clay has run the company's European PC
division. HP's former PC chief joined Apple Computer Inc.
recently.
   Improving its market position in PCs and workstations is
critical to HP's future because its minicomputer business,
once a mainstay, is under siege. "The minicomputer business
is faced with obsolescence," said Peter Rogers, an analyst
with Robertson Stephens &amp; Co.

   I would add that not only are we overpopulated, but also
we have a multitribal and unproven community. To add large
quantities of immigrants of different cultures would produce
an explosive mix.
   There is a free movement of peoples in Europe, so the
whole of Europe is affected by the immigration policies of
each nation. Immigration must be determined by the European
constitution and, "inter alia," the real meaning of the

their ex-colonies must be reassessed unflinchingly.

   Ameritrust Plans
   11.5% Reduction
   In Work Force

   CLEVELAND -- Ameritrust Corp. said it will slash 780 jobs,
or 11.5% of its work force, in an effort to offset loan
losses resulting from an overly aggressive growth strategy.
   As a result of the retrenchment, Ameritrust said it will
record a third-quarter charge of between $14 million and $18
million. However, the bank holding company expects the charge
will be offset by reduced operating expenses and gains from
extraordinary transactions, such as asset sales. In the
year-ago third quarter, Ameritrust earned $30 million, or 70
cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ameritrust, which had a loss of $33.2 million in the first
half of 1990, said the cutbacks will help trim expenses by
10%, or $32 million, by 1992. About 60% of the 780 jobs will
be actual cuts as the company reduces or eliminates
divisions, while the remaining 40% will come from attrition
and the reduction in temporary employees.
   While the company offered few specifics about which
departments would be affected, it said it would
"de-emphasize" the area involved with highly leveraged
transactions, such as buy-outs or acquisitions.
   That is where Ameritrust got in trouble, analysts said, as
the company aggressively built its loan portfolio around the
go-go merger and acquisition activity of the 1980s. It ended
1989 with $892 million in highly leveraged loans, or 11% of
total loans outstanding. The bank's nonperforming assets shot
up to $262.4 million for the second quarter from $157.4
million at the end of the year-ago quarter.
   But the highly leveraged transactions, as well as other
commercial real estate loans, soured. Earlier this year
federal examiners reviewed the company's loan portfolio and
-- applying tougher regulations -- forced it to significantly
increase its loan-loss provisions. The company's loan-loss
reserves totaled $153.4 million in June compared with $21.5
million a year earlier.
   As a result, wary investors have backed off, with the
share price falling more than 50% from its 52-week high of
$29. In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Ameritrust closed
at $14, off 62.5 cents.
   The bank, with $10.8 billion in assets, now says it's
going to focus on more conservative consumer banking, trust
and investment management and corporate banking, with an
emphasis on small and medium-sized Midwestern businesses.
   Henry C. Dickson, an analyst at McDonald &amp; Co., Cleveland,
said Ameritrust's problems festered for a number of years,
but that the bank hasn't made cuts on this scale in his
memory.
   "They were in businesses that weren't that profitable," he
said. "Because there's a lot of excess capacity in the
industry now, you have to be more realistic about how you're
going to make money." Last year Ameritrust, Ohio's fifth
largest bank, earned $116 million, or $3.11 a share.

   Acme Electric
   To Post Decline
   In Per-Share Net

DOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO)
</IN>
<LP>
   EAST AURORA, N.Y. -- Acme Electric Corp. will post
lower-than-expected earnings of about 78 cents a share for
the year ended June 30, G. Wayne Hawk, president and chief
executive officer, said.
   However, Mr. Hawk said in an interview that the power
conversion equipment concern will start to show better
results in fiscal 1991, as newly developed programs become
profitable. Capital that was poured into these programs
limited earnings this past year, he said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In fiscal 1989, Acme reported net income of $3.9 million,
or 85 cents a share, including a one-time credit of $443,000,
or 10 cents a share, for an accounting adjustment.
   "It was a flat year compared to last year," Mr. Hawk said.
Sales were off "a few hundred dollars" from $91 million in
fiscal 1989. He expects earnings in the first quarter, which
ends Sept. 30, to be close to last year's 16 cents a share.
He also projected sales in excess of $100 million for fiscal
1991.
   Mr. Hawk attributed the disappointing 1990 results to a
slowdown in the construction industry, which hurt Acme's
sales of large air-cooled transformers. The company also lost
practically all its September sales of battery chargers when
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., a major customer, rearranged its
departments. The easing of Cold War tensions also forced Acme
to scale back its expectations for its power supplies for
aerospace and defense.
   The disappointments were partially offset by unexpectedly
high growth in custom power supplies for computer systems.
   Mr. Hawk said net income would have increased an
additional 25 cents a share without the costs the company
incurred in developing new programs. These include a
redesigned back-up power supply for personal computers and
local networks. Mr. Hawk said he expects an 80% increase in
sales in this area in 1991.
   Acme also produced its first fiber nickel-cadmium battery
in February, which it expects to generate annual sales of $20
million within three years.
   The new efforts "haven't had a real bottom line impact,"
said John B. Walthausen, an analyst with C.L. King &amp;
Associates, Albany, N.Y. But, he added, "It's starting to
come through now."
   Since Acme has incurred high costs to expand, it could be
particularly vulnerable in a recession. The sluggish
Northeastern computer industry has already hurt business, Mr.
Hawk said. Acme hopes to counteract a slowdown with its new
products and increasing foreign sales.
   When Mr. Hawk, 62 years old, assumed his position at Acme
in 1987, yearly earnings had bottomed out at 15 cents a
share. He has since shifted the sleepy transformer concern
into a more diversified electronics business employing 1,055
people. "It's been a painful and expensive process," he said.

   A man from Cornell University phoned to say that his
school was planning to commemorate the anniversary of an
athletically significant event, and while I don't usually
bite for such things this one seemed worthy of note. Come
this fall, 50 years will have passed since the famous "Fifth
Down Game" between the football teams from Cornell and
Dartmouth.
   In case your memory needs jogging about that Nov. 16,
1940, contest -- mine did; I was only two years old at the
time -- here are the salient facts. Cornell, undefeated and a
contender for the nation's No. 1 ranking, trailed a
determined Dartmouth squad, 3-0, in the fourth quarter at
Darmouth's Hanover, N.H., stadium. As the clock ticked toward
zero, Cornell mounted a drive, gaining a first down on the
Dartmouth six-yard line. Three running plays netted five
yards. With 10 seconds left Cornell called time out, but that
would have exceeded its allotment of those and it was
penalized five yards. A pass into the end zone fell
incomplete.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That should have been that, but it wasn't. Referee William
"Red" Friesell ruled Cornell had another down coming. The Big
Red used it to pass for a touchdown as the gun sounded, and
the extra point made the score 7-3. There was some confusion
afterward about what had happened, but everyone went home
believing Cornell had won.
   The next Monday, though, Cornell coaches and officials
reviewed films of the game, and confirmed that the touchdown
shouldn't have counted. They so informed Friesell, who, upon
reflection, admitted his error. After consulting the Big Red
team, and hearing some understandable grumbling (one Cornell
player noted that game officials' mistakes in Dartmouth's
favor weren't being corrected), Cornell offered to concede
the game. Dartmouth accepted, and it went into the book,
forevermore, as a 3-0 Dartmouth win.
   Cornell long has basked in the glory of that decision, and
rightfully. I think it is no simple-minded yearning for some
elusive "good old" day to observe that the cause of justice
in sports never has been better served.
   This conclusion has been inescapable these past few weeks,
which I have spent, more or less, on vacation. From high
places and low has come evidence that the people who
administer the present-day world of sportsbiz are not keeping
their eyes on the ball, if they ever had them there to begin
with.
   Exhibit A came from a reader who passed along newspaper
clippings detailing the travail of Michael Hanner, a
nine-year-old Little League baseball player from Kirkland,
Wash. Michael, a pitcher, was happily playing on a team with
his friends, but with a few games left in the season was
"drafted" by a club in a higher division. When he balked at
the switch, the league (i.e, its adult overseers) said he
couldn't play at all.
   Michael's parents got a lawyer who, eventually, persuaded
a judge to allow the lad to finish the season with his
original team. But the league insisted that its pro-style
drafting rules were proper and would be enforced against
future recalcitrant nine-year-olds.
   Moving up a bit in the adults-vs.-kids department, we come
to the NCAA, whose judgments rarely fail to puzzle. The
outfit that makes college sports' rules is being sued by
Braxton Banks, a Notre Dame student-fullback, who entered his
name in the last National Football League draft but wasn't
picked. He wants to play for the Irish again this fall, but
the NCAA, claiming that his action violated its requirement
that players be amateurs, says he can't.
   A couple of points are obvious here, but ought to be made
anyway. One is that the only amateurs in the sizable cast
that stages college football are the boys in pads. The other
is that unless ND is paying Banks, nobody is, and he's still
simonpure.
   It further should be said that the real, and perhaps sole,
beneficiaries of this NCAA policy are the NFL and
pro-basketball teams, which can bargain with the
college-eligible players they do select without having to
worry that the young men might choose to go back to school
instead. It's bad enough that the colleges are grid and hoops
farm teams without their also helping the pros hold down
their payrolls.
   Curiouser yet was the recent NCAA ruling to extend a
probation against Clemson, but to apply no new penalties, as
a result of evidence that coaches at the school dispensed
steroids to athletes. Three former Clemson assistant football
coaches have pleaded guilty to criminal charges in this
matter. The NCAA leaps to punish schools that give athletes
things, like T-shirts, rides in coaches' cars or the
occasional odd dollar. It apparently sees less wrong with
exposing them to the physical and psychological horrors tied
to steroid use.
   Finally, we come to "l'affaire" Steinbrenner, which has
occupied much of the press for much of the last few months.
Seems that George, Major League baseball's Tyrannosaurus Rex,
paid one Howard Spira, usually described as a former gambler,
to produce some dirt on Dave Winfield, a former Steinbrenner
baseball employee with whom The Boss has had an inexplicable
but long-running feud. For this, Commissioner Fay Vincent
ordered that Steinbrenner be severed from the management of
the ballclub, usually called the New York Yankees, while
being allowed to retain his majority ownership interest.
   One need not be a pal of George's to note that the
decision raised more questions than a week of "Jeopardy." Was
The Boss punished for his deed, or for having contact with
Spira? If it's the latter, how come Winfield, who'd also had
dealings with the guy, isn't getting socked, too? Why did a
federal grand jury look at the Steinbrenner-Spira
transactions and indict Spira for extortion?
   And if George is supposed to keep his mitts off the Yanks,
why did Vincent say it would be okay for him to pick his
successor, including his son, Hank? That could still occur
even though another fella has been named for now. If Dad,
over dinner, wanted to express an opinion on, say, the worth
of the team's field manager, was Sonny expected to turn a
deaf ear?

   AMSTERDAM -- KLM Royal Dutch Airlines reported that net
income for its first quarter ended June 30 plunged 82% to
41.4 million guilders ($23.5 million), or 0.78 guilder a
share, from 230.1 million guilders, or 4.36 guilders a share,
a year earlier, when results reflected a big gain.
   The Dutch flag carrier said fiscal first-quarter profit
from its normal operations before taxes and extraordinary
gains fell 74% to 27.8 million guilders from 105.1 million
guilders a year earlier, citing foreign currency swings and
lower exchange rates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Extraordinary gains accounted for 13.6 million guilders of
profit, compared with 125 million guilders in the
year-earlier quarter, reflecting proceeds from a divestiture.
   KLM blamed the weakness of the dollar and the Japanese yen
for eroding traffic revenue. Though its total airline traffic
for the fiscal first quarter increased 6% from a year
earlier, traffic revenue rose only 2%.
   Earlier this month, the carrier warned that margins would
be under pressure during fiscal 1991, for which it declined
to give any earnings forecast.

   Net About Doubled
   In Fiscal 4th Period

   Reader's Digest Association Inc. said fiscal
fourth-quarter earnings nearly doubled from a year earlier,
despite mounting losses at its specialized magazine
operations.
   But the Pleasantville, N.Y., media company attributed the
jump in earnings largely to the negative effect of charges
taken in the 1989 fourth quarter. Excluding the effect of the
1989 charges, per-share earnings rose about 16% in the latest
period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the quarter ended June 30, net income rose to $20
million, or 16 cents a share, from $10.3 million, or nine
cents a share, a year earlier. The 1989 quarter included
costs from a program of awarding stock to senior management
and relocation of a U.K. subsidiary.
   For fiscal 1990 -- the first full year of operations since
the company went public on Feb. 15 -- net rose to $176
million, or $1.48 a share, from $151.5 million, or $1.28 a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue reached a record $2.01 billion, up 17% from $1.8
billion a year earlier.
   Reader's Digest said its largest contributor to earnings
was its book publishing and home entertainment unit, which
had a 19% rise in operating profit, to $229 million. Reader's
Digest magazine, including its domestic and numerous
international editions, had operating profit of $75.4
million, a 22% increase from 1989.
   A growing area of weakness was the company's special
interest magazines, which include New Choices, Family
Handyman, Travel Holiday, American Health and the recently
acquired Moneywise, a U.K. personal finance magazine. Losses
at the unit grew to $26 million from $17.2 million in fiscal
1989.
   Reader's Digest chairman George V. Grune said the losses
were due to "investment spending" on magazines to improve
their editorial quality. He said soft advertising for
consumer magazines also contributed to the unit's losses.

   Your Money Matters:
   Belying Ads, Home Auctions Aren't Bargain Basements

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS (REA)
</IN>
<LP>
   You've only got a few minutes to negotiate the biggest
purchase of your life. A crowd of strangers is watching, and
a silver-tongued auctioneer is running up the price. Crack.
The gavel falls.
   It's hard to imagine a more nerve-wracking way to buy a
home. Yet, as the nationwide real estate slump continues,
home auctions are spreading from the Farm Belt to the suburbs
and the big cities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Once employed almost exclusively to unload foreclosed
properties, auctions are being used more and more as a
marketing tool by real estate developers. Roughly $26 billion
of residential and commercial property was sold at auction
last year, up from $10 billion in 1980, according to Stephen
Martin, president of Gwent Group, a Bloomington, Ind.,
auction-consulting firm.
   But prospective buyers eager to grab up choice properties
at bargain prices may be disappointed. Home auctions
generally offer only modest savings, at best.
   Last May, New York City architect Stephen Chiang went to a
condominium auction in Manhattan hoping to buy a one-bedroom
apartment. But one-bedroom units in the new luxury
development went for about $50,000 more than he could afford.
Mr. Chiang ended up paying $132,000 for a studio apartment on
the 21st floor.
   "Looking back on it, I don't think the savings were that
significant," he says.
   Ads touting luxury properties with minimum bids that are a
fraction of their original asking prices do nothing to
discourage the notion that homes can be purchased on the
cheap. Steven Good, president of Chicago-based Sheldon Good &amp;
Co., one of the nation's largest real estate auctioneers,
says he typically sets opening bids at 30% to 40% of the
original price.
   To further entice prospective buyers, many developers
offer a small block of units "absolute," which obligates them
to accept the winning bid, regardless of how low it is.
   In practice, however, homes sold at auction seldom go for
rock-bottom prices, auctioneers say. The advertising attracts
large crowds, and the large crowds tend to bid up the price
to close to market levels.
   For example, in June 1989, more than 3,000 people flocked
to Connecticut's first residential real estate auction to bid
on 48 condominiums in East Haven. "Clearly, the audience was
packed with people who showed up and thought they were going
to get units for $1," says Steven Kerschner of Nolan K.
Kerschner Co., the Norwalk, Conn., developer of the property.
   Instead, the average buyer paid about $180,000 a unit,
probably not too much below market value, says Mr. Kerschner.
   If the sale is energetically promoted, "people pay fair
market price at a given day at an auction," says Gwent's Mr.
Martin. He says his firm's clients have netted anywhere from
74% to 95% of the appraised value of the properties they've
sold at auction. But because developers frequently use
outdated appraisals, these figures exaggerate the actual
discounts, says Mr. Martin.
   Even being the only bidder interested in a property
doesn't guarantee that you'll get a bargain. Developers
usually offer most of their units with a "reserve" option,
which gives them the right to reject the winning bid, even if
it exceeds the minimum bid price advertised before the
auction. Developers also reserve the right to halt the
auction midstream if the properties aren't fetching adequate
prices.
   Despite the drawbacks, people in the auction business say
such sales can be attractive for savvy buyers. "The effect to
the buyer is that it allows him to take advantage of bulk
sale prices without having to buy a number of units," says
Mr. Good. In addition, buyers can expect to close in a matter
of days, and secure below-market-rate financing through a
mortgage lender brought in by the developer.
   In general, auctioneers caution that prospective buyers
should do extensive homework before bidding on a property.
Most important, they say, is a visit to the property -- which
is typically open for inspection for several weeks before the
sale.
   Because properties are sold "as is," bring along an
expert: a contractor, an architect, perhaps even an
appraiser. If you don't get an independent appraisal, visit
comparable properties in the area and find out what they are
selling for. Then, set a bidding limit.
   Mr. Good says that the single biggest problem for would-be
buyers is they "don't read the terms of the auction, and that
goofs them up." If the property is a condominium, closely
scrutinize the prospectus and offering plan, which should
contain such critical information as the offering statements,
title report, condominium budgets and association budgets. If
you don't understand them, show them to a lawyer.
   Remember that you can't get through the door to many
auctions without a cashiers check or certified check for 10%
of the minimum opening bid.
   Finally, get to the auction early. Often, the auctioneers
will announce that certain units have been taken off block
and that mortgage interest rates have changed.
   While several states -- New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,
and Florida are among them -- give buyers a few days after
the auction to back out of a sale, most offer no such
protection. That makes it critical for potential buyers to
know exactly what they want to do when the bidding starts.
   "Typically, we sell a property every two or three
minutes," says Mr. Good, "which doesn't leave a whole amount
of time for indecision."

   Iraqi Chief Is Saddam Hussein
   In Most of This Paper;
   Elsewhere, Its a Tossup

   WASHINGTON -- Saddam Hussein's name is in the news. But
the question is: which is correct when you're using only one?
   In the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune
and the Baltimore Sun, the Iraqi strongman is called Hussein,
as in the New York Times headline, "Hussein's Achilles Heel."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But at the Washington Post, the Associated Press, USA
Today, Time and Newsweek, Saddam gets the nod. "Security
Officials Foresee Saddam Turning to Proxy Terrorists," the
Washington Post said.
   So far, nobody is using one of the Iraqi leader's full
names: Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti. Nor are they adding
hosannas that his followers might use, such as "Hero of the
Arabs" or "Sword of Islam."
   Yahya Sadowski, a Middle East expert at the Brookings
Institution here, says an Arab man can have up to four names.
He will have his given birth name -- Saddam, in this case. He
will have his family or tribal name -- such as Hussein, which
literally means "little beautiful," Mr. Sadowski says.
   The Iraqi leader's third name, "al-Tikriti," means "of
Tikrit," a town in central Iraq. But that name was dropped
after 1977 because too many members of Iraq's ruling Ba'ath
party were also "al-Tikriti."
   Still another moniker comes from the name of a first son.
Around the Iraqi Embassy here, says press officer Abdulrahman
Jamil, the Iraqi leader is sometimes called "Abu Uday," which
means "the father of Uday," the name of his eldest son.
   Most Arabs refer to the Iraqi president as "Saddam," Mr.
Sadowski says. One reason is that Hussein is an extremely
common name in the Middle East and "Hussein" alone would be
confusing.
   The U.S. media are trying to avoid the same kind of
mix-up. One reason the Washington Post went with Saddam for
the Iraqi dictator is that "just reading `Hussein' opens up
the possibility that the casual reader would confuse him with
King Hussein" of Jordan, says Michael Getler, the Washington
Post's managing editor for foreign news.
   But Ed Wright, an assistant foreign editor at the Los
Angeles Times says, "It's our understanding that {Saddam} is
not a legitimate second reference. It's more of an informal
second reference . . . like the use of `Fidel' for Fidel
Castro."
   Even the same publication sometimes can't agree. To avoid
confusion with Jordan's king on The Wall Street Journal news
pages, reporters, editors and headline writers have been
instructed to use "Iraq's Hussein" or "Saddam Hussein." "But
you should not use Saddam or Hussein by itself." The paper's
editorial page, however, uses "Saddam."

   Saatchi to Sell Back McCaffrey &amp; McCall

   McCaffrey &amp; McCall's management has agreed in principle to
buy the ad agency from parent Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co., but at a
price lower than initially expected, executives close to the
talks said.
   The proposed buy-back follows more than a year of
negotiations and shows just how far the fortunes of Saatchi
and the ad business in general have fallen since those
negotiations began. According to the executives, McCaffrey
would put up $2 million and receive $15 million in notes from
Saatchi, which McCaffrey will pay back over several years.
The total purchase price is significantly less than the
approximately $32 million total Saatchi paid for the agency,
whose blue-chip clients include Mercedes-Benz, Burroughs
Wellcome and Bacardi.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The proposed purchase price is also less than half of the
approximately $40 million Saatchi had been demanding early in
the talks. And it is less than the $25 million to $30 million
deal that McCaffrey announced it was close to striking last
November. That deal never came to fruition, in part because,
with banks becoming more cautious and demanding more
restrictive terms, McCaffrey executives couldn't find
favorable financing.
   McCaffrey &amp; McCall declined comment, and Saatchi
executives couldn't be reached. But people familiar with the
talks said that if all goes according to plan, the proposed
buy-back would probably be completed and announced around the
end of Saatchi's Sept. 30 fiscal year.
   The proposed transaction reflects Saatchi Chief Executive
Robert Louis-Dreyfus's determination to streamline the
troubled advertising giant as quickly as possible. Mr.
Louis-Dreyfus earlier this year dumped the bulk of Saatchi's
consulting businesses at a loss, selling Peterson Consulting,
for example, for which Saatchi had paid $116 million, for
less than $20 million. Analysts have lauded Mr.
Louis-Dreyfus's speed, saying that despite the low prices,
they are encouraged he is taking decisive steps to turn the
ailing company around.
   The depressed price also reflects the declining fortunes
of the ad business. Just since last fall, ad agency
valuations in general have fallen, both because of the
uncertain economic environment and because the ad spending
outlook is mediocre on a good day. Saatchi's financial
position has also deteriorated, though investors so far
appear to have confidence in Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, a French
executive who was brought in to take charge in January.
   "The company and the marketplace have changed dramatically
in the last months," said an executive familiar with the
talks in explaining why the price is lower than initially
expected. Industry executives, however, say that McCaffrey
remains profitable.
   McCaffrey has been trying to buy itself back because the
agency doesn't fit well with the rest of the Saatchi empire.
With billings of $254.2 million, it is small by Saatchi
standards; Saatchi's two major agency groups both have
billings exceeding $4.7 billion. At the same time, McCaffrey
has found it difficult to grow because it can't take on
clients that would compete with the accounts at its bigger
siblings. Industry executives say Mercedes, for example, is
uncomfortable because other Saatchi units handle Toyota and
Hyundai.
   McCaffrey also suffers from perennially low visiblity
because it is so overshadowed by its larger sister agencies.
Despite such classy, high-profile accounts as Tiffany and
Hartford Insurance, the agency doesn't draw the kind of
attention that other mid-sized agencies, such as Ammirati &amp;
Puris and Levine, Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver, have attracted.

   Tatham-Laird Fills Posts
                                                                                                       

   Tatham-Laird Kudner, Chicago, made several changes in its
top management because of recent new business and the
departure earlier this year of an executive.
   William Youngclaus, who had been president and chief
operating officer, joined Tatham-Laird's parent, RSCG Group,
in Paris last March as president of RSCG-Europe.
   Under the reorganization, Ralph Rydholm, currently
managing partner and chief creative officer, was given the
additional post of Tatham-Laird chairman, taking a title that
Charlotte Beers, who remains chief executive officer, had
previously held. Ian Miller, most recently a senior vice
president at Ogilvy &amp; Mather in Chicago, was named president
and managing partner. A spokesman said the agency's growth --
earlier this week it won the estimated $15 million account
for Procter &amp; Gamble's Old Spice and Santa Fe men's
toiletries -- spurred Mr. Miller's hiring.
   Bob Hielscher, formerly a senior partner, was promoted to
chief operating officer and managing partner.

   Gatorade Ad Threat
                                                                                                       

   The mayor of Siena, Italy, says his city will take legal
action in response to Gatorade ads that used an altered photo
from the city's Palio festival.
   Full-page ads appeared in Italian newspapers this week
showing a flag-bearer from the centuries-old horse race
carrying a flag altered to bear Gatorade's name and logo.
   Siena, a city of 60,000 in central Italy, in the past has
fought to block others -- including car maker Fiat and TV
baron Silvio Berlusconi -- from profiting from association
with the festival.
   The Palio is the name of a banner that's given to the
winner of a horse race run three times around the city's
oval-shaped central piazza. The race is televised nationally
and draws tens of thousands of tourists to the city.
   A city spokeswoman said the city will almost certainly sue
Pirella Gottsche Lowe, the Milan agency that prepared the ad,
but she didn't know whether Quaker Oats, maker of Gatorade,
would also be named.

   U.K. Central Bank Says Mideast Crisis
   Won't Kick Off 1970s-Style Inflation

   LONDON -- Central bankers say the new round of oil-price
increases won't ignite inflation the way those of the 1970s
did, largely because monetary authorities have learned some
valuable lessons about how to handle them.
   That was one of the assuring messages the Bank of England
disseminated yesterday along with its latest economic
bulletin. Many private economists and officials from the West
German Bundesbank and the Bank of Italy are speaking along
similar lines. The brokerage concern UBS Phillips &amp; Drew even
took the position in a report this week that this year's oil
shock is really just a "shockette."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the relatively breezy assessments make two fundamental
assumptions that may be overturned by events: that the crisis
won't spread and disrupt production outside Iraq and Kuwait,
and that oil prices won't push much higher than $25 a barrel.
   Assuming that bigger price increases can be avoided, a
Bank of England official said, the major economic powers
should be able to deal with the disruption better than they
did during the 1970s. Generally, the official said, "the
message that the monetary authorities received from those
episodes is that they {would} do well not to adopt an
accommodating stance."
   An accommodating stance would be one where governments
loosened credit, increased spending or cut taxes to offset
the effect of higher energy bills. But in the 1970s, such
policies helped set off a general rise in prices and wages,
the central bankers said, without bringing about the real
economic growth that was desired.
   This time, one European central banker said, it's clear
that "there's no reason for a reduction in interest rates."
   Officials from the Bank of England said the need to blunt
the inflationary effects of more costly oil, together with
Eastern Europe's hunger for capital, means that "the
medium-term prospects are for high interest rates," which
will have the effect of slowing down national economies.
   Although Britain's economy has already been squeezed, with
its base lending rate currently at 15%, the Bank of England
didn't express any intention of easing. "We want to maintain
a non-accommodating policy and firm exchange rates," an
official said. He added that this stance is consistent with
entry into the exchange-rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System. "Going into the mechanism needn't be thought
of as a new departure," he said.
   Another reason for optimism about the consequences of the
Middle East crisis, the Bank of England said, is that the
oil-producing nations themselves will show different economic
behavior this time. Specifically, they are expected to spend
more on foreign investments and in building up their own
economies. That should lessen one of the big problems of the
1970s -- recycling the petrodollars that flowed in waves to
the Middle East.
   For Britain, the crisis has caused a mix of economic
consequences, the Bank of England said. Inflation, expected
to rise to 10% or higher in the government report due out
today, will be more difficult to tame with energy costs
rising. However, the British pound has strengthened
considerably since Iraq invaded Kuwait two weeks ago, and
that has the effect of making imports cheaper. It also
encourages U.K. companies to keep prices under control
because British goods are already being made more expensive
by the rising value of the currency.
   More broadly, the Bank of England urged major Western
nations to encourage higher savings to support what is
expected to be a heavy demand for capital. The bank cited the
reconstruction of the Eastern European economies, which will
be hit hard by oil-price increases, and the even heavier
demand for capital from the U.S. The Bush administration's
budget deficit is expected to come to $170 billion in 1991,
excluding the cost of the savings-and-loan bailout. If the
oil shocks send the U.S. economy into recession, the
government's lake of red ink is expected to grow.

   NEW YORK -- Erol Aksoy, managing director and principal
stockholder of Turkey's Iktisat Bank, paid $8 million for a
two-thirds interest in Park Avenue Bank, which caters to
wealthy individuals.
   The 43-year-old Mr. Aksoy, who also is chairman of Banque
Internationale de Commerce of Paris, plans to expand Park
Avenue Bank's operations to include financing trade.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Aksoy, a native of Istanbul, named Huseyin Unver, 41,
president of Park Avenue Bank. Mr. Unver has been Iktisat
Bank's representative here for the past year; prior to that,
he was a vice president and area manager responsible for
lending activity in several Middle East countries for Irving
Trust Co., now part of Bank of New York Co.
   Park Avenue Bank, a private bank, has one branch and $15
million in assets. The bank has posted a loss of about
$600,000 so far this year, Mr. Aksoy said. Iktisat Bank, with
about $1 billion of assets, earned about $20 million in the
fiscal year ended June 30, he said.
   Banking services to the wealthy is a very competitive
business and "New York is an expensive place," Mr. Aksoy
said. But in trade finance, a small bank can be more flexible
than the majors, Mr. Aksoy said, adding that requests for
letters of credit, which are principal trade financing
instruments, generally require a response in no more than 24
or 48 hours.

   Soviet Musical Rocket Zooms

   Lenox, Mass. -- The first recording by Valery Gergiev, a
37-year-old Soviet conductor plucked out of obscurity two
years ago to head the Kirov Theatre of Leningrad, is the
summer's most hyped and widely discussed classical release.
Unfortunately for Mr. Gergiev, few reviewers of the Philips
disc seemed to notice that he was part of the enterprise.
That's because they were fixated on the singer making his
recording debut on the same disc. This glamorous young Soviet
baritone, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, is the newest star in the
operatic firmament. And Mr. Gergiev was essentially deploying
the Rotterdam Philharmonic as a grandiose accompanist.
   Mr. Gergiev also nearly failed to be noticed in his first
public appearance in the U.S. At a recent Saturday morning
open rehearsal at Tanglewood, the young maestro walked onto
the stage mostly unrecognized. Wearing a blue-and-green
Tanglewood T-shirt he could have been any local conducting
student. And when, without ice-breaking small talk, he
gestured to the Boston Symphony Orchestra violins to edge
into the six shimmering A-major chords that begin Wagner's
Prelude to "Lohengrin," many in the audience continued
talking.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Those opening chords, however, were wonderfully wrought,
and it didn't take long for Mr. Gergiev to grab his
listeners' attention. As the volume increased, the phrasing
turned bold and vivid, and it became clear that Mr. Gergiev
is an unusually intense and unpredictable conductor.
   That night, his passionate performance of Tchaikovsky's
Fifth Symphony -- an unlikely interpretation in which a
ponderous first movement, an unconventionally light and
Italianate Andante, a raspy Waltz and a spasmodically
exciting Finale all sounded inevitable -- brought a huge and
astonished Tanglewood crowd to its feet.
   Apparently that same scenario has been playing itself out
regularly for Mr. Gergiev over the past two years. At the
Kirov in 1988, Mr. Gergiev almost instantly turned into one
of the three or four most important and powerful conductors
in the Soviet Union. Since then, he has been busily
conducting all over Europe and in Japan. He serves as
principal guest conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic,
while continuing with the Kirov. He has signed a major
recording contract with Philips, and he now has his own
blockbuster release in the shops -- Mussorgsky's "Pictures at
an Exhibition."
   If success is happening with startling speed for Mr.
Gergiev, he seems ready for it. He is, above all else, a fast
learner, something that helped him right from the beginning,
as a piano student of 14 or 15 in a village in the Caucasus.
"I was mainly interested in playing soccer -- we are crazy
about this game in the Caucasus," he explains, with the same
bug-eyed intensity he brings to the podium. "I thought so
much about sports, I always learned my sonatas the very last
two or three days before my examination. But I learned very
fast. So my teacher thought that I must have some talent but
that I was too lazy to become a pianist, and she asked me to
start thinking about conducting.
   "Nobody, of course, expected that I would become one of
the leading conductors of my country," Mr. Gergiev continues
in fluid English, which he reputedly learned in a year. Mr.
Gergiev enrolled in the Leningrad Conservatory to study
conducting. But it wasn't easy for a young conductor in
Leningrad to get ahead. The Soviet Union's greatest
conductor, the very self-protective Yevgeny Mravinsky, ruled
supreme over the Leningrad Philharmonic until his death in
1988. So Mr. Gergiev turned to the Kirov, where he found a
job as a lowly assistant conductor. And without perestroika,
that is undoubtedly where he would have remained when the
Kirov's director, Yuri Temirkanov, was selected to succeed
Mravinsky at the Leningrad Philharmonic.
   "Before perestroika," Mr. Gergiev claims, "the officials
made all musical appointments, and the minister of culture
selected another man to head the Kirov after Temirkanov
left." But completely to Mr. Gergiev's and the nation's
surprise, the musicians and singers of the company held their
own defiant election and selected him by a vote of 85%. "This
simply could not have happened a year earlier."
   Mr. Gergiev immediately set out to make his mark at the
Kirov, and only seven months after his appointment he
produced a major Mussorgsky festival that was of
unprecedented scope in Soviet musical history. He mounted all
five Mussorgsky operas, including the unfinished opera based
on Flaubert's "Salammbo," which had never been performed in
the Soviet Union and for which Mr. Gergiev commissioned a new
scholarly edition of the score. He performed the epic opera
"Khovanshchina" complete, another Kirov first, and has now
recorded it for Philips. Most notably he recently arranged to
import a production of "Boris Godunov" from Covent Garden,
the only opera directed by the late Soviet film maker Andrei
Tarkovsky. It was televised live and will be out next year on
a London videodisc.
   Mr. Gergiev boasts that his Mussorgsky festival was the
talk of all the Soviet Union, and his new recording of
"Pictures at an Exhibition" backs him up. The performance is
a distinctive one even in a competitive market. There may be
dozens of versions of the piece on the market, but few
conductors are willing to take some of the risks Mr. Gergiev
does. Caring little for the modern fashion of sacrificing
expressiveness for instrumental brilliance, his account often
sounds raw in comparison with the others, as if he is pushing
every player to the limit.
   Whether this hyperexpressive approach will prove as
compelling in non-Russian repertoire remains to be seen. Mr.
Gergiev's Wagner and Mozart program at Tanglewood didn't make
quite the impact his Tchaikovsky one did. But that hardly
matters right now, since Mr. Gergiev has lots of Russian
opera on his mind. Next up for the Kirov is a festival of all
the Prokofiev operas, then all those of RimskyKorsakov,
assuming the rocky Soviet economy can fund these very
ambitious projects. Meanwhile, Mr. Gergiev will keep
traveling. He returns to the U.S. in October for two weeks
with the San Francisco Symphony, and then will appear with
orchestras in Dallas, Houston, Minnesota, Toronto and New
York. Next year he will conduct his first opera in this
country -- a new production of Prokofiev's "War and Peace" at
the San Francisco Opera.

   For a good number of years now, Quebec nationalism has not
implied the desire to live in seclusion: Quebec's
determination to ensure cultural security is absolutely
compatible with its determination to create new political and
economic relationships with its partners and to open up to
foreign cultures.
   The rising integration of national economies is encouraged
by the liberalization and the multiplication of world trade.
Market globalization incites smaller economies to specialize
their production and expertise in order to carve a place for
themselves in the international economic order. Therefore,
smaller economies such as Quebec's may expect to keep their
competitiveness facing the giants. The new international
economic order does not eliminate the legitimacy of the
aspirations of nations to master their own development but
obliges them to rethink their economic strategies and to show
initiative.
   It is Quebec's and the rest of Canada's challenge to
identify a political and constitutional system that will
provide Quebec with the position and powers necessary to its
development and to the strengthening of Canadian and North
American economic partnerships.
   ---
   The differences of opinion between Quebec and the
government of Canada go way beyond economic problems alone,
but these differences are nevertheless considerable. Probably
the most important economic problem that Quebec has to face
is the macroeconomic policies of the Canadian government.
   Firstly, given the policy of high interest rates enforced
in Canada, the cost of capital is higher than in other
industrialized countries. This situation puts obstacles in
front of investment ventures that otherwise would be
profitable and slows down Quebec's economic growth, while
unemployment levels remain above 9%. Furthermore, high
interest rates cause an artificial rise of the Canadian
dollar in terms of other foreign currencies. At the actual
rate, which the Bank of Canada tries to preserve, the
overvalued dollar substantially reduces the power of Quebec's
enterprises to compete, and export levels are reduced.
   Secondly, even though Quebec shares the Canadian
government's goal of deficit reduction, it does not accept
the federal government's demands to the provinces to reduce
their expenses and to raise taxes in its place. For example,
the reduction in transfer payments to provincial governments
constitutes the main budget cut measure announced in the last
federal government budget. This behavior makes budget
planning far more complex for the government of Quebec, the
objective of which is a systematic budget reduction while
maintaining a competitive fiscal burden. It also tends to hit
more sharply the poorer provinces, which goes against one of
the great principles of the Canadian constitution.
   Finally, the present system brings a costly duplication of
public services in too many areas. The result is a fiscal
burden higher than necessary, and an inefficiency that can be
significant in services offered to the population. In a
context of increased economic competition on the world
market, governments and enterprises must rationalize their
interventions, and produce at minimum cost the best public
services possible.
   The government of Quebec is convinced that the welfare of
its people will depend on a sound macroeconomic policy, on a
budget policy of the federal government that does not put the
province at a disadvantage, and on a maximum efficiency in
the supply of public services if it wants businesses to face
with success the challenges of international competition and
technological change.
   ---
   During the '60s -- and even into the '70s -- active state
intervention to sustain economic development in Quebec was
desirable for several reasons: the insufficient presence of
the core sectors; the absence of Francophones at the
decision-making level of private enterprises; entire sectors
of the economy that needed to be modernized, etc. During this
period, the government's role probably was more pronounced in
Quebec than in most Canadian provinces, even though several
provinces had recourse to governmental intervention in one
form or another.
   Today, the situation has changed. Since 1985 the
government's role has mostly been to create an environment
that favors the birth of entrepreneurship, and the
establishment of new businesses and investment. Moreover, the
tax burden of enterprises and individuals has been reduced.
Furthermore, the government has privileged an approach for
fiscal incentives to stimulate investment into the
fundamental determinants of our growth: research and
development, introduction of new technologies and skill
development.
   Even described in broad outline, these developments help
us to easily understand why it is in Quebec -- and not
elsewhere in Canada -- that we found the greatest support for
the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Today's Quebec is ready
to carry through the necessary investments to meet the
challenges provoked by international competition and
technological change. Quebec thus will enter this period of
re-examination of its relationship with the rest of Canada
truly believing in its capabilities and its future.
   In short, the government thinks that by uniting as many
favorable conditions as possible for business, the Quebec
society will be able to prosper and preserve its cultural
coherence. The Quebec government therefore must maintain a
fiscal burden compatible with economic growth and speculate
on mechanisms that will favor the development of a private
sector very competitive on a world scale rather than impose
itself through direct commercial and industrial action. st
   ---
   If the Quebec government's intention was to substantially
modify the rules of the present economic system, I would
understand investors' concerns. However, on the contrary, the
new arrangement sought after by Quebec within the Canadian
federation will take into account the necessity to maintain
-- ideally, to improve -- commercial relations between Quebec
and the other Canadian provinces, such as Ontario. Quebec's
future, whatever political arrangement will be accepted, must
lean on a strong and prosperous economy. That guarantees the
future improvement of the population's standard of living and
the preservation of the distinct character of the Quebec
society.
   Viewed from this angle, a rearrangement of the Canadian
federation ultimately could enable Quebec to provide itself
with additional tools to be better prepared to face the
economic situation foreseen for the '90s. Thus, an
economically and financially stronger Quebec would be the
result.

   HOUSTON -- Comedians and clowns have been popping up in
recent years to make business meetings more lighthearted, fun
and memorable.
   But it's tough to get a laugh when the punch line is
"nonylphenol ethoxylate."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Just ask Charles Greene III. The 29-year-old magician
specializes in bringing levity -- and levitation -- to the
petrochemical industry. Since 1988, he's played the trade
show circuit, using magic tricks to hawk resins, drug testing
and horizontal oil-field drilling.
   He's even sold cement. At the World of Concrete trade show
in Atlanta, he rhapsodized about drying time and durability
while turning a glass of water upside down without spilling a
drop.
   Other performers, says Mr. Greene, wouldn't touch cement
-- let alone nonylphenol ethoxylate, a chemical agent that
makes soaps bubble. They gravitate to sexier merchandise such
as pricey sneakers or food or toys. But Mr. Greene says he's
happiest when "the product itself is bland and doesn't have
an attractive quality."
   Specializing in a technical field, he says, gives him an
edge: "The more technical the industry, the better my chances
of being used." At a Houston trade show in March, he showed
off a horizontal oil-drilling technique by making a needle
thread itself.
   His performances may not be the stuff that made Houdini
famous, but Mr. Greene has found that making magic for
corporate America is pretty profitable. His fees start at
about $2,500 a day, including expenses. "If you're not
charging companies what they expect to pay, they won't think
you're any good," he says.
   Companies seem to be happy to add a little magic to their
act. A spokeswoman for Reichhold Chemicals Inc. said Mr.
Greene's appearance at the Cultured Marble Show in Charlotte,
N.C., earlier this year yielded "just rave reviews. His magic
is just so perfected that he's incredible."
   Others aren't so sure they want to comment. Asked about
Mr. Greene's performance at a national sales meeting in
February, a marketing director at Soltex Polymer Corp. passed
the question on to a product manager, who got the company's
legal counsel on the phone, who fobbed it off on a public
relations consultant.
   The final verdict, however, was positive. Said the
consultant: Mr. Greene is "a unique individual who has an
ability to understand a company."

   Dutch Farmers Use Their Mussels
   To Crack Open a Weakening Market

   YERSEKE, the Netherlands -- You might call this place
Mussel Beach.
   Wholesalers and packers of mussels line the waterfront in
Yerseke, the center of an industry that employs 1,500 people
and produces annual exports of about $50 million. Tomorrow,
as many as 50,000 people are expected to visit Yerseke for
the annual Mussel Day. Bands will play, fireworks will burst
and free mussels will be served. Not to be outdone, the
nearby town of Philippine will elect a mussel queen the
following weekend.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Despite all the hoopla, the mussel-farming business has
had a lot of sand kicked in its face recently. Winter storms
swept away large numbers of mussels just as they were growing
big enough to eat, and mussel farmers here in the province of
Zeeland expect an even bigger decline next year. Traders in
Yerseke think output will be 10% to 20% below average this
year and down as much as 60% next year.
   Mussel growers fear they won't be able to raise prices
enough to cover the drop in volume. It's also ominous for
Belgians, who each year gobble up around two billion Zeeland
mussels. About 35% of Zeeland mussels go to Belgium, where
the onset of the mussel-eating season each August is, as one
restaurateur puts it, "truly an event." In his song "Jef,"
Belgian songwriter Jacques Brel could think of no better way
to console a lovelorn friend than a binge of moules and
frites -- mussels and french fries.
   The outlook for next year's crop is bleak chiefly because
fishermen have found few baby mussels in the past two years.
"We don't know why," says Leo Lucas, manager of the mussel
producers association. At the Dutch Institute of Fisheries
Research, marine biologist Renger Dijkema ventures that
mussels' enemies, mainly bacteria, have thrived in the recent
mild winters. "The Belgians will be longing for their
mussels," Mr. Dijkema concludes sadly.
   They probably will be paying dearly for them, too. Already
this year, wholesale mussel prices in Yerseke are up 20% to
25% from a year earlier. In Belgium, a serving of moules and
frites, traditionally a cheap meal, now can cost more than a
steak.
   Growing Zeeland mussels can be a gritty job. Twice a year,
the Dutch mussel farmers fish for their "seed" mussels,
babies about one centimeter, or 0.4 inch, long. The seed is
then scattered onto seabeds rented from the government. After
two or three years of munching on plankton, the mussels are
big enough to be harvested.
   The mussels are dredged, purged of sand and barnacles and
dispatched to canneries or rushed to stores and restaurants
in refrigerated trucks. Until cooked, they must be kept alive
at all costs.
   An old theory says that shellfish can only be eaten in
months with the "R." But because of refrigerated trucks,
producers now say it's fine to eat mussels in July or August.
   Of the so-called Zeeland mussels, only about a third
actually grow up in Zeeland's eastern Scheldt estuary. The
rest come from the Netherlands' north coast or from Denmark
or West Germany. Imports attain the Zeeland name merely by
being dunked in the eastern Scheldt for a week or two to soak
up the "taste of Zeeland."
   Given this murky labeling, some restaurateurs clam up
about the exact origins of the mussels they serve. But
Ann-Marie Veulemans of Francois, a seafood restaurant in
Brussels, insists she can distinguish between true Zeeland
mussels and impostors, judging by color, taste and shape. Any
supplier who tries to slip Danish or German mussels into her
order, she warns, can forget about doing further business
with Francois.
   Even with an impending shortage, Zeelanders press on with
marketing efforts. Last month, the mussel association told
Belgian journalists about a new study showing that mussels
are much lower in cholesterol than previously thought. Faced
with heavy competition from U.S.-style fast food, the
Zeelanders figure they need to keep flexing their mussels in
the international market. After all, Mr. Lucas says, "the
Dutch don't like them very much."

   HAMPTON, Va. -- Once it was enough to get together 20 or
so relatives, feed them macaroni salad on a picnic table and
hope that Betty Ann's ex-husband didn't show up and ruin
everything.
   Now clans like the Colemans, who trace their roots to
mid-19th century Virginia, attend convention-style reunions,
lasting two or three days, complete with cruises, computer
print-outs of the family tree and personalized gee-gaws --
souvenir thermos bottles and pouches emblazoned with "The
Coleman Family Reunion, 1990, Hampton, Va." If an unruly ex
attends, it's not so obvious. These reunions are big.

   The trend toward pricey, Love Boatish reunions is
particularly prevalent among black families like the
Colemans: middle-class, well-educated, proud of their
accomplishments, with lots of relatives eager to establish
family ties.
   Businesses have been quick to respond. The Memphis Hilton
Hotel, for example, has scheduled 15 reunions this summer --
all for black families. "It's a good piece of business for
us," says Kitty Bronaugh, the hotel's director of catering.
Holiday Inn Hotels is focusing on black reunions as part of
its Family Programs marketing. And for the second year in a
row, Kraft General Foods is targeting black audiences with
its Kool-Aid brand "Family Reunion Sweepstakes," which
carries a grand prize of $20,000 toward reunion expenses.
   The Coleman confab -- staged at the Radisson Hotel in
Hampton, Va. -- cost $45,000. To keep his family's expenses
under $2,500, Charles Coleman traveled with his wife,
daughter and grandchild by train for three days to Hampton
from Los Angeles.
   For those among the 150 reunioneers who couldn't stay with
a relative, the hotel cost $65 a night. Then there was the
$125 registration and activity fee. This included a trip to
colonial Williamsburg, a junket to Busch Gardens, and a
cruise on the sleek Spirit of Norfolk, which went around the
harbor a few times while the Colemans chowed down on roast
beef, salmon and chicken breast "supreme." James Harris,
known as "Uncle Dick," a big man with a fixed grin and a
white yachting cap turned backward, asked one of the servers
about the cuisine: "Where's the fried chicken? You don't have
any chitterlings? This is not family reunion food," he says.
   But no one seemed to mind the food, or the expense. For
67-year-old Charles Coleman, the journey was well-rewarded.
"This is a sight to behold," he declared after seeing his
relatives and home state for the first time since 1936. "This
is where it all began."
   The Colemans have been holding biennial reunions since
1976. At the first, 20 family members gathered at the Houston
home of Percy and Sally Creuzot, who operate a chain of Texas
barbecue restaurants. The group began talking about Alex
Haley's book "Roots," tracing a legendary black family's
lineage. That triggered a discussion of their own family
heritage. When 84-year-old Aunt Gerri -- who has since died
-- started sharing a wealth of names and family history, they
decided it was time to take notes.
   "We got down on the living room floor, rolled out some
white meat-wrapping paper and started writing," recalls
Gordon Coleman.
   From that simple list has evolved a 25-yard-long computer
printed family tree, bearing about 250 names.
   According to research by Coleman family members, their
ancestry began in 1832 in Halifax County, Va., when Gordon
Coleman, the son of a doctor, had an affair with Edmonia, one
of the family's slaves. Edmonia had been an African tribal
princess before her arrival in America, according to
government documents. Their child, Charles Spurgeon Coleman,
was born in 1858 and later, he and his wife, Elizabeth
Gaines, a freed slave, had 14 children. Thus the begatting
began in earnest.
   Charles and Elizabeth's great-great-granddaughter, Grace
Harris, says that the recent interest in reunions and lineage
have changed attitudes toward family events once considered
scandalous or embarrassing. The fact that the Coleman family
started through an illegitimate childbirth was not discussed
during her childhood, recalls Ms. Harris, vice provost at
Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.
   "Now we see this is nothing to be ashamed of," she says.
"This is part of the whole black experience in America. We're
more open about saying this is part of our heritage."
   At this reunion, family members honor that heritage. One
morning on the campus of Hampton University -- where freed
slaves were taught to read under a gigantic "Emancipation
Oak" tree that still stands -- the Colemans gather in a
circle and hold hands. They pray for deceased family members.
Mamie Bacote ends her prayer by reading aloud names of the 31
family members who graduated, between 1913 and 1985, from the
122-year-old historically black college. Twenty-seven
graduates are attending the reunion.
   "We came back to Hampton to show the kids that this is
where many family members received an education," says Gordon
Coleman, a fourth generation descendant. "We want our kids to
have a sense of family and self-worth and to know who they
are."
   That sense of self-worth is also the driving force behind
the nationwide Black Family Reunion, held annually by the
National Council of Negro Women. Dorothy Height, who heads
the group, says the extended black family has "historically
been our strength."
   This reunion is "for those who can't afford their own,"
she says. Ms. Height points out that the purpose of the
reunion -- held in as many as six different cities each year
-- is "to make each other feel better about our society's
problems. The families that really need to be strengthened by
reunions may never be able to otherwise afford one." This
past weekend, 200,000 people gathered in Cincinnati to
discuss infant mortality and pre- and post-natal care, issues
that concern senior citizens and young fathers, as well as
education, careers, fitness, sports and beauty.
   The Colemans have an elaborate reunion because "we are
fortunate enough to be able to," says Ms. Harris. But, she
adds, "We ask ourselves is just getting together enough" --
or should it be even fancier?
   Three-year-old Jenna Johnson, Gordon and Edmonia's
great-great-great-granddaughter, has a more carefree attitude
toward the reunion. Dressed in a turquoise jumpsuit with
white barettes in her hair, she takes to the stage of the
cruise ship's main deck, and begins a solo performance
beneath flashing red and blue lights.
   Her impromptu dance to the band's '60s medley of rock 'n'
roll and soul hits gets things started. Family members rise
from their seats and begin clapping and urging Jenna on.
Minutes later the dance floor has filled with nearly 70
family members -- including grandparents -- forming lines and
taking syncopated sliding steps to the right, then the left,
backward, forward, dipping their hips, spinning around and
ending with a kick.
   "We're doing the Electric Slide," explains Teddy Bacote
III. "We like to do it when we get together for family
celebrations."

   Science and Literature Reconciled

   Literary types have always tended to take a pretty dim
view of science. Their attitudes range from Romantic contempt
-- Wordsworth's "We murder to dissect" -- to the snobbery of
Oxford dandies who used to refer to the subject as "Stinks."
The big gulf between the scientific community and the
humanities crowd, already noted by the
scientist-turned-novelist C.P. Snow in his famous "Two
Cultures" lecture in 1959, has not gotten any smaller.
   "A Literary Guide to Science" (Norton, 517 pages, $24.95)
is the latest ecumenical gesture on the part of science
toward the literary world. Its editor, Walter Gratzer, is a
researcher in biophysics at London University, who must also
have been doing rather a lot of bedtime reading over the
years. Here he has compiled more than 200 excerpts from
novels, memoirs, biographies, plays, reportage and verse,
plus a few complete short stories -- that represent
"incursions of science into literature." Each is preceded by
a pithy introduction. Although the selection is heavily
weighted toward the 20th century, he's not forgotten about
Swift, Pope, Byron, Flaubert and Samuel Butler. There is
almost no science fiction, which by and large is neither very
literary nor very scientific.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "A Literary Guide" is well-leavened with comedy, beginning
with an amusing account by James Thurber of his inability to
see absolutely anything through a microscope, to the immense
annoyance of his botany professor. Only after a year of
trying every conceivable adjustment of the instrument did he
finally manage to record an image of "a variegated
constellation of flecks, specks, and dots," which he took for
plant cells until his enraged instructor pointed out that
Thurber had drawn a reflection of his own eye.
   Elsewhere in the book we are treated to the spectacle of
Renaissance astronomer Tycho Brahe's tame elk imbibing too
much beer and falling fatally down some stairs; of
archbishops struggling with books on relativity theory (only
to be told by Einstein that "it is a purely scientific matter
and has nothing to do with religion"); and of Alexander
Graham Bell trying to get the dying President Garfield to
swallow a light bulb so that the assassin's bullet inside his
body could be located.
   Otherworldly though scientists are reputed to be, here we
see them acting all too human, both in fact and in fiction.
They sabotage one another's experiments, steal credit for
discoveries, bicker about the order of authors' names on
scientific papers, develop neurotic obsessions with the Nobel
Prize, and get duped by psychics; one even pronounces nuclear
as "nucular," just like Jimmy Carter.
   A particularly unattractive physicist named Otto Warburg
accepts the status of "honorary Aryan" from the Nazis so that
he can remain in his Berlin laboratory even though he is half
Jewish. Asked by a journalist how he felt about the charge
that he was "a great scientist but a rotten human being,"
Warburg replied without a twinkle in his eye: "I am glad they
do not say the other way around."
   More appealing is the rounded character portrait drawn of
that towering British physiologist J.B.S. Haldane -- who was
also a classics scholar, an ardent communist, a war hero and
a wag. We are given engaging views of the man from
biographies, memoirs, and from Aldous Huxley's novel "Antic
Hay," in which he was a character. Also included is a
surprisingly good short story by Haldane himself, a dryly
witty thriller about a conspiracy to extract gold from sea
water.
   Pop topics are not scanted by "A Literary Guide." Those
who have forgotten about Kurt Vonnegut's "ice-nine" will find
a brief refresher from his "Cat's Cradle," plus another
account by Mr. Vonnegut of how the idea for this
ocean-congealing substance was first offered by a General
Electric scientist to H.G. Wells, who declined to make
fictional use of it. Wilhelm Reich's notorious orgone box,
which was supposed to do everything from healing wounds to
improving orgasms, gets sent up by that great puncturer of
science frauds, Martin Gardner.
   Mr. Gratzer admits that he may have omitted worthy stuff
due to ignorance, but how did he come to ignore Joyce and
Nabokov? Did science touch their writing? It did. Nabokov's
memoirs include a marvelous account of his scientific
fascination with butterflies. Joyce devoted an entire episode
of "Ulysses" to the theme of science and coined the term
"quark" (used by physicists to denote the basic building
blocks of matter) in "Finnegans Wake."
   There are sins of commission as well as omission: Many of
the excerpts Mr. Gratzer has included from forgotten
scientific novels are too brief to achieve critical mass, and
are written in less than delicious prose. But the average is
pushed up well above the purchase threshold by literary gems
from the likes of Primo Levi, Michael Frayn and John Updike,
who plainly knows as much about contemporary physics as he
does about Kierkegaard and funky sex. With items such as his
charming bit of doggerel about neutrinos streaming through
the bodies of lovers in Nepal, this guide ought to keep even
the most jaded literary aesthete amused.

   Workplace:
   At Giant Kodak,
   `Intrapreneurs'
   Lose Foothold

   ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- When Henry Gottfried bought a carved
mahogany cat, he never figured it would come between him and
his employer, Eastman Kodak Co.
   But it did, and in many ways, Mr. Gottfried's experience
with Kodak and his four-foot wooden feline typifies the
problems that can occur when big companies try to instill
entrepreneurial zeal within their monolithic structures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gottfried's venture was part of a program begun by
Kodak in 1984 in which employees operate semiautonomous small
businesses. The company hoped the ventures could
commercialize technologies that didn't have a home in Kodak's
core business groups, which now consist of photography,
information systems and pharmaceuticals.
   While Kodak's efforts were praised last year in the
management book "When Giants Learn to Dance," the program was
always an awkward minuet, and today the party's clearly over.
Of the 14 ventures Kodak created, six have been shut down,
three have been sold, four have been merged into the company
and only one still operates independently.
   One casualty was Mr. Gottfried, who managed a business
that developed computer software and video-training products.
Dismissed by Kodak in 1987 for not meeting earnings
projections, Mr. Gottfried says the company didn't like his
business unit's logo -- a Cheshire cat, modeled after his
wooden friend.
   "Some Kodak managers said they couldn't understand why a
serious organization would use a cat," he says. After his
dismissal from the unit, called Discus Electronic Training,
Kodak gave it a new logo, a giant letter D. The business has
since been folded.
   Kodak isn't the only company that has had disappointing
results with internal ventures. Back in the 1970s,
"intrapreneurship" became a buzzword among managers who
wanted to introduce small-business fervor into lumbering
corporations. The idea was that the parent company would
provide seed money to employees, who would gain the
satisfaction of running their own shop while producing
products that benefited their corporate sponsor.
   The ventures did produce some successes. International
Business Machines Corp. developed its IBM personal computer
through such a venture. At Xerox Corp., about a half dozen
successful companies have been created, and Aluminum Co. of
America has high hopes for a venture that's marketing a
high-tech laminate.
   Most, though, have fallen flat. Companies like Control
Data Corp. and Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., now part of U
S West Inc., have ended their programs. So did IBM, which
says the program was unneccessary after the company
decentralized. The upshot: "intrapreneurship" has lost its
cachet.
   The problem, management experts say, is that a go-go
small-business culture can't easily be grafted onto a
deliberate corporate giant. The practices that make
corporations successful -- training procedures, personnel
policies, hierarchical management structures -- are anathema
to risk-taking, free-wheeling entrepreneurs.
   In addition, employees-turned-entrepreneurs are often
ill-prepared for their new roles. Researchers, for example,
who have spent their careers in the lab are unfamiliar with
the rigors of the marketplace.
   At Kodak, most of the venture managers were Kodak
employees with no experience running the kind of business the
company envisioned. "If you're running a small business, you
have to be willing to give up your house, your home, your
wife, your kids -- you have to be dedicated," says Stephen
Sayles, a former Kodak venture manager. "People who take jobs
with big companies usually aren't those type of people."
   A look at Kodak's ventures offers a glimpse into the
difficulties of whipping up an entrepreneurial environment in
a company not known for individualism or risk-taking. The
ventures were also part of a painful era for Kodak -- the
last half of the 1980s, characterized by restructurings and
layoffs, when nothing seemed to go right. Though Kodak posted
surprisingly strong second-quarter earnings, it's not yet
clear if past problems are behind it.
   Kodak's intrapreneur program was never profitable,
although Kodak won't say how much it invested. Last year,
amid a steep profit decline, Kodak said it would no longer
seek new ventures and instead would focus on its core
businesses.
   Not surprisingly, company officials and former venture
managers, some of whom are still embittered by the
experience, tell different stories about why the program
failed. But they seem to agree on at least one point:
Managers should have an equity stake in the start-up to make
them feel like it's their business, not the corporate
parent's. Kodak managers had no ownership interest in the
ventures although some received large payments when Kodak in
effect acquired the units and merged them with a main
business line.
   For their part, Kodak officials say they didn't monitor
the ventures closely enough, didn't make them stick to
business plans and were too forgiving, at least initially.
   "We didn't shoot the wounded," says Robert J. Tuite, who
was one of the architects of Kodak's venture program and has
taken a leave of absence from the company. Kodak officials
also say the new managers were naive about running a
business. "Technologists believe that a good idea will make a
good business, but it's tougher than that," says Dennis M.
Deleo, who's now in charge of the venture program.
   Former venture managers, however, accuse Kodak of setting
unrealistic sales goals -- $50 million in five years -- and
not giving them the autonomy they say they needed.
   Take Scott C. Arrington, an outside consultant who was
hired in 1985 to run a venture called Estek, which made
machines that cleaned silicon wafers. While he had authority
in hiring, he says, he had to use Kodak engineers,
researchers and other employees in joint-development efforts.
   "The Kodak people would take their eight-hour workday and
go home," he says. "When you have a start-up company, you
typically work longer hours and harder than a 20-year
employee."
   Mr. Arrington also ran afoul of Kodak management when he
bought a Xerox copier instead of a Kodak copier. "Xerox was
cheaper and better, and I was responsible for how much money
we were spending," he says, adding that Kodak never
understood the larger point of being an entrepreneur.
   "It's just not a matter of making money," he says. "It's a
matter of achieving something and feeling good about it.
That's why an entrepreneur works long hours. But Kodak took
that control away and killed the entrepreneurial spirit."
   By 1987, Estek had $10 million in annual sales but was
behind projections. Kodak toughened its sales goals, and Mr.
Arrington was fired. "I was shocked, and I felt sorry for the
people who were still there," he says. Kodak won't comment on
the dismissal of Mr. Arrington or any other employee.
   The company, dissatisfied with Estek's performance,
eventually broke up the unit, selling one division and
merging the other into Kodak. Mr. Arrington now works for an
international trade company.
   Once a venture chalked up strong profits, Kodak intended
to bring it into a mainline business group. But here again
things didn't work out as planned. A business called Sayette
Technologies, which made overhead projector parts, began in
1986 and racked up sales of $25 million in its first year.
Kodak's Motion Picture &amp; Audio Visual Division, in effect,
acquired the profitable unit from the venture manager, Mr.
Sayles, who took a job in another Kodak division.
   Kodak, however, later decided that Sayette didn't fit the
company's strategic interests, and the unit was sold off this
year. Kodak won't say if it sold Sayette for more or less
than it bought it. Mr. Sayles, who eventually left Kodak,
says Sayette's profit fell under Kodak's management because
costs skyrocketed. Once it was no longer a venture, Kodak had
to pay health and retirement benefits and use the company's
distribution network, which Mr. Sayles says was more
expensive.
   In addition, Mr. Sayles says, Kodak, which has $18.3
billion in annual sales, didn't give Sayette the attention a
fledging enterprise needs. "A small company must make
decisions faster than a large company," he says. "We only had
one or two lines of businesses to concern ourselves with,
whereas Kodak has thousands."
   Meanwhile, Mr. Gottfried, a consultant before becoming the
Discus venture manager, admits he made mistakes while running
the unit, but blames Kodak's outsized expectations for
dooming the business. To reach the $50 million annual sales
goal, Mr. Gottfried says, he had to take steps that
ultimately caused expenses to spin out of control. "Kodak
wouldn't accept a profitable $2 million business," he says.
Kodak shut down Discus last year, saying the unit didn't fit
the company's strategic interests and didn't make enough
money.
   Nothing, however, gave Mr. Gottfried a bigger headache
than trying to reclaim his wooden cat, which he bought from a
Belize woodcarver for several thousand dollars. He says that
he left it in his Kodak office but that his successors didn't
want to give it back.
   Finally, he says, he called Kodak's legal department, and
on a Sunday morning eight months after he had left the
company, he got the cat back.

   Europe's Drivers Are Largely Unaffected
   By Iraq Crisis, but Car Makers Face Risks

   BRUSSELS -- For Western Europe's car makers, it could have
been worse. With car sales already slack and Japanese
competition on the rise, the last thing these manufacturers
needed was an oil crisis.
   But the standoff in the Mideast so far hasn't led to the
shortages or lines at the gasoline pumps seen during the oil
shocks of 1973 and 1979. And, assuming the situation doesn't
take a turn for the worse, car makers in Europe don't expect
it to have a serious impact on their sales.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The reaction of the public to what happens in the
{Persian} Gulf is much more rational now than in the 1970s,"
says Richard Gaul of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. "People
just don't seem frightened" by the current showdown over
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait early this month.
   If Western Europe generally is facing the situation with
serenity, that may be because its cars -- and its entire
economy -- use fuel more efficiently than the U.S. does. "The
basic issue is who uses energy most efficiently," says Krafft
Holtz of Euroeconomics, a London-based forecasting and
management consulting firm. "And the answer is Europe."
   While the U.S. reverted to some of its gas-guzzling habits
during the Reagan years after a period of energy
conservation, many European nations moved vigorously to cut
oil consumption. France, for instance, used oil to supply 69%
of its energy needs in 1979. Thanks in large part to
extensive use of nuclear energy, that figure today is less
than 40%.
   In addition, gasoline prices in most of Europe are already
so high that an increase of a few pfennigs or centimes won't
make much difference, analysts say. Peter Bogin, an American
who works with Cambridge Energy Associates in Paris, says:
"Gas already costs $4 a gallon in France. If it costs $4.50,
that won't stop people from buying a car. In America,
however, it could prove the last blow which pushes the
country into a recession."
   Another advantage for Europe is the decline in the value
of the dollar. Because oil is generally priced and traded in
dollars, the U.S. currency's weakness partly offsets the
price rises for Europeans.
   However, if the gulf standoff stretches into a
debilitating long-term affair or breaks into open war,
economists and analysts say higher energy costs would cut
into company profits and could force European central banks
to raise interest rates to control inflation.
   That could hit the European car industry particularly
hard. Steven Reitman, an auto analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew,
says its market already had shrunk slightly in the first
seven months of 1990. Auto makers were counting on the
opening up of Eastern Europe to give them a long-term boost.
   Almost all the major European manufacturers had announced
joint ventures in recent months, either to take over existing
factories or to build new ones in Eastern Europe. But that
region's former insulation from oil price rises is ending
with its supply of subsidized Soviet oil, and the new Mideast
shock will add to its problems.
   "The companies were expanding to meet anticipated demand
in Eastern Europe, where rates of car registration are low
and there is a huge unsatisfied demand," Mr. Reitman says.
"But the oil shock will force them to revise these
capital-spending plans."

   Researchers Locate Gene That Increases
   Accumulation of Fat in Bloodstream

   Scientists learned how a particular gene can sharply boost
the amount of fat circulating in the bloodstream, increasing
the risk of heart and other diseases.
   The new finding, made by transplanting the suspect human
gene to mice, suggests why many people have high blood levels
of triglycerides, the common fats that seep into the blood
stream from the diet and from the liver. The study, published
in this week's issue of Science, was conducted by researchers
at Rockefeller University in New York.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Triglycerides' role in causing disease is neither as
certain nor as well publicized as the link between high blood
cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease. But high
triglyceride levels -- hypertriglyceridemia -- have been
linked to coronary disease as well as diabetes, pancreatitis,
kidney failure, and alcoholism among other conditions. High
triglyceride levels are common among people who are obese and
sedentary.
   Uncovering the genes that underlie high levels of fats and
cholesterol in the blood is expected to lead to new tests
that can pinpoint people with a genetic predisposition for
heart disease and other problems. The research, by revealing
the genetic defects involved, could also lead to new,
tailor-made treatments for the various disorders linked to
high blood fats.
   Generally, doctors grow concerned when they find a
patient's triglyceride levels are above 250 milligrams of fat
per deciliter of blood. Some doctors consider levels above
150 milligrams to be unhealthy. About 10% of all men over the
age of 35 years have triglyceride levels above 250 milligrams
whereas such high levels are relatively uncommon in women.
   In the new report, the researchers pinpoint a gene called
the C-III gene as a probable source of high triglyceride
levels. Normally, the C-III gene produces a protein that
wraps itself around globules of triglyceride fats in the
early stages of the body's processing of fats. The C-III
protein allows the fats to be grabbed by the watery part of
the blood stream for transport to other parts of the body.
   High levels of the C-III protein occur in people with high
triglyceride levels but until now it hasn't been known
whether the excess protein was causing the
hypertriglyceridemia, explained molecular geneticist Jan
Breslow, who headed the research team.
   To find out, Dr. Breslow and his colleagues took the human
C-III protein gene and implanted it into the germ cells of
mice. The result was two lines of so-called transgenic mice,
each with functioning copies of the human C-III gene.
   One of the lines of mice happened to end up with 100
copies of the human C-III gene. These mice produced large
amounts of the C-III protein and had levels of triglycerides
in their blood stream on the order of 1,000 to 1,500
milligrams per deciliter of blood, or several hundred times
higher than normal mice.
   The second line of transgenic mice had only one or two
copies of the human C-III gene. They had triglyceride levels
about double those of normal mice and thus more closely
resembled the human situation.
   The results, the researchers said, show that overactivity
of the human C-III gene can lead to high triglyceride levels.
They speculated that some as yet-undiscovered mutation of the
gene, or the genetic elements that control it, leads to the
gene becoming overactive and producing excess C-III protein
that, in turn, raises triglyceride levels. Exactly how the
C-III protein raises triglyceride levels isn't yet known.

   Commodities:
   Gold-Futures Prices Advance $6.60 on Concerns
   Over Mideast, Inflation and on Dollar's Weakness

   NEW YORK -- Anxiety about developments in the Middle East,
inflationary fears and the dollar's weakness in world
foreign-exchange markets sent gold-futures prices surging
$6.60 an ounce.
   December gold ended at $417.90, just a dime shy of the
day's highest trade, after reports of new threats by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This market is strictly being run by Iraq," said William
O'Neill, senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch. "Any
sign of heightened tension is immediately being reflected in
the gold market."
   At the same time, he added, the rise in the price of gold
reflected problems of the dollar and concern about inflation
following release of the consumer price index for July. The
government report showed that prices, excluding energy and
food, rose 0.6%. Expectations had been for an increase of
about 0.4%, Mr. O'Neill said.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Mint reported that sales of American
Eagle gold coins are soaring, a strong indication of a flight
to safety and away from dollar-denominated assets. In the
first 14 days of August, sales of the coin totaled 44,000
ounces, the Mint said, more than in each of the three
preceding months. Sales of the one-ounce version of the coin
accounted for 41,500 ounces, a spokesman said.
   The total sales compare with 40,000 ounces in May, 43,000
in June and 20,000 in July, the Mint spokesman said. The drop
in July came because it is typically a slow month for coin
sales, he said.
   Further evidence of gold enthusiasm came from Earl Hadady,
editor of the Bullish Consensus, a Pasadena, Calif.,
organization that takes daily surveys of sentiment among
investment professionals. While negative sentiment about the
stock market has been growing, he said, "almost seven out of
10 traders are bullish" on gold.
   That's cause for caution, said Mr. Hadady, because it
suggests "the market is now beginning to be overbought. When
you get such a preponderance of buyers, the buying trend
begins to run out of steam. We're looking for the gold market
to top out soon."
   In other markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Live cattle futures closed narrowly
mixed as traders evened up their contract holdings ahead of
this afternoon's release of the government's cattle on feed
report for July. Most futures analysts are expecting a 5% to
6% increase in the number of cattle placed on feed lots last
month compared with July 1989. The number of fattened cattle
being shipped off feed lots to be slaughtered rose about 3%
in July, compared with a year ago, analysts estimated. Live
cattle futures for October delivery gained 0.12 cent a pound
to close at 77.92 cents. The increased supply of cattle on
feed lots as of last month won't reach slaughterhouses for
about five months, so the October contract hasn't been
affected by predictions for more crowded feed lots. But
December live cattle futures dipped 0.02 cent a pound to
76.52 cents, reflecting the outlook for an increased
slaughter by year end.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices were higher despite two bearish
developments. The October contract ended with a gain of 0.24
cent a pound at 11.14 cents. Before the opening, a report by
F.O. Licht, a West German sugar statistical firm, projected a
one million-ton surplus for the 1989-90 season, which ends
Aug. 31. Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers,
said the surplus had been anticipated, following a Cuban
report earlier this year that the country's production would
be higher than some outside estimates. Around the close of
trading, the second set of French sugar beet tests was
reported. France is expected to produce 7,101 tons of beets
per hectare. (A hectare is equal to 2.47 acres.) This
compares with 5,803 tons in the first test on Aug. 1, and
6,861 tons in the previous season's second test. Sugar
content of the beets was put at 18.88%, compared with 17.31%
on Aug. 1 and 16.63% a year earlier. According to Ms. Kaul,
the recent dry spell didn't affect the beets because it
wasn't prolonged enough.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices were easier. The September contract
was 0.90 cent a pound lower at $1.3265. In early trading, the
contract was up to $1.3460. Japanese demand for copper, which
has been a big spur for prices, was absent in London
yesterday, an analyst said. There were no other fundamental
developments, and traders by and large were watching to see
if the inflationary impact of higher oil costs will adversely
affect the already softening U.S. economy and reduce demand
for copper.

   Northeast Bancorp
   Still Might Pursue
   Sale Agreement

   NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve Board may have ended the
takeover of Northeast Bancorp by Bank of New York Co., but
Northeast isn't giving up completely.
   On Wednesday, the Fed denied Bank of New York's petition
to acquire Northeast for $195.6 million, saying the merger
would hurt Bank of New York's ability to maintain a strong
capital position.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Northeast plunged
$5.25 to $12.25; Bank of New York fell 12.5 cents to $24.375
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Although the Fed's decision could be appealed by either
bank, such actions are unusual. Immediately after the
decision Bank of New York said the merger couldn't go
forward. But yesterday Northeast said it is considering
putting additional breach of contract charges in a lawsuit
seeking either to complete the merger or obtain damages from
Bank of New York.
   Bank of New York "had an agreement to acquire us and an
obligation to maintain the capital levels that would let them
consummate that agreement," said George Kabureck, president
of Northeast.
   What started as a friendly merger agreement in 1983
deteriorated badly in recent months as the banks argued over
the book value of Northeast, a critical element in
determining what price Bank of New York would pay for
Northeast. (The agreement was pending revisions in
Connecticut banking laws that would allow out-of-state
purchases.)
   Northeast claimed a book value that would result in a
purchase price of about $500 million, while Bank of New York
said a price of $195.6 million was more appropriate
considering the shaky nature of some of Northeast's real
estate portfolio. Northeast sued to force Bank of New York
either to complete the merger at the higher cost or to pay
damages.
   A Bank of New York spokesman said Northeast's charges are
"ludicrous." He said Northeast officials saw Bank of New
York's application to the Fed before it was filed and never
issued any objections to the financial statements in the
application, including Bank of New York's capital position.
   Mr. Kabureck said the application was given to Northeast
on a Friday afternoon before Bank of New York filed it with
the Fed the following Monday. He said Northeast would decide
in the next few days what steps it would take involving the
court suit.

   Ads Claim `Import Intenders'
   Prefer Its Compact Cars
   To Japanese Competitors

   HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Anxious to keep sales from
slipping further this year, Chrysler Corp. is trotting out
another survey that once again asserts its cars are better
than Japanese models.
   This time, Chrysler is saying that two groups of
California consumers -- consisting of people who own only
domestic-brand cars -- preferred Chrysler models over
competing cars made by Toyota Motor Corp. Specifically,
Chrysler's advertising says, the consumers picked the Dodge
Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim over the Toyota Camry, and chose
the Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance over the Toyota
Tercel.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last May, Chrysler began an aggressive advertising
campaign that said another group of buyers picked the same
Chrysler models over Honda Motor Company's Accord and Civic.
As with the earlier claims, the latest surveys were conducted
with groups of 100 "import intenders," defined by Chrysler as
domestic-brand car owners "who are thinking about buying an
imported car." The surveys didn't ask any owners of foreign
cars for their evaluations.
   Chrysler selected so-called import intenders "because
these are the people we're trying to get to take a look at
what we have these days," says Chrysler spokesman Tom
Jakobowski. But some advertising executives and pollsters
have criticized the Chrysler survey as being too limited in
the types and numbers of consumers surveyed.
   Chrysler is aiming its advertising squarely at Japanese
car makers, who claimed a record 26% share of the U.S. market
last year and have continued their gains this year.
   Chrysler, on the other hand, has seen its share of the
U.S. car market fall to 8.8% so far this year, from 10.4% a
year earlier. When the year is over, Chrysler may wind up in
fifth place -- behind Honda and Toyota -- in sales of cars
alone, although Chrysler would still lead those companies in
combined sales of cars, trucks and minivans.
   While Chrysler's car-market share remained flat after the
ads challenging Honda, the campaign seemed to help boost
sales of the compact Spirit and Acclaim. Sales of those
models, which have received high quality ratings, jumped 19%
to 112,052 cars in the first seven months of this year. But
some of the gain is attributable to slower production last
year when the cars were just beginning to hit the market.
Sales of the Shadow and Sundance were off 19.8% through the
end of July.
   In fact, so far this year Honda has sold more U.S.-built
Accords and Toyota more U.S.-made Camrys than Chrysler has
sold Spirits and Acclaims combined. Likewise, U.S.-made Honda
Civic subcompacts have outsold the Shadow and Sundance.
   Chrysler started airing two commercials with the Toyota
comparison on network and cable television Wednesday, and it
will run print ads beginning Monday. Unlike the Honda
comparisons, the new broadcast campaign won't feature
Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca. Instead an announcer will
say during the ads: "The cars that beat the Honda Civic now
beat Toyota. Who's next?"
   Chrysler commissioned the survey from U.S. Testing Co.
Market Research Inc., the same Wheeling, Ill., firm that
conducted the Honda comparisons. Chrysler said the two groups
of consumers, consisting of owners of General Motors Corp.
and Ford Motor Co. cars, tested the Chrysler and Toyota
models over a 2.4-mile route and were asked to compare 33
attributes. The consumers weren't told that the test was
sponsored by Chrysler, the company said.
   Of the 100 consumers in the Toyota Camry LE comparison,
Chrysler said 80 picked the Spirit and Acclaim. In the Honda
comparison, Chrysler said 83 preferred its two models to the
Accord.
   The group that tested the Shadow and Sundance against the
Toyota Tercel Deluxe preferred the Chrysler vehicles 91 to 9,
Chrysler said.

   In the West Bank,
   Palestinians Rally
   To the Iraqi Cause

   RAMALLAH, Occupied West Bank -- It is the middle of a
weekday, but the shops lining the main market square of this
battered Palestinian town of 40,000 are closed, their metal
shutters locked tight.
   Ramallah, like every other town in the Israeli-occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, came to a standstill Wednesday as
Palestinian residents strictly observed a general strike
called to protest the U.S. "occupation" of Saudi Arabia, and
to demonstrate support for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
Spray-painted graffiti attests to the intensity of local
feeling: "Defeat to America" proclaims one. "The hand that is
raised against Iraq should be amputated" reads another. A
fake bomb was placed in the town square, looking real enough
to cause Israeli troops to evacuate the area.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earlier in the week, the imam of a mosque in Bethlehem was
pulled out of his pulpit after questioning the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait. Palestinians flooded the streets in celebration
when a short-lived rumor circulated that Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak had been assassinated, and an Israeli TV crew
was stoned at a pro-Iraqi parade.
   Developments in the Persian Gulf are clearly exacerbating
tensions between Arabs and Jews in Israel's occupied
territories. Until Iraq invaded Kuwait two weeks ago, the
30-month-long Palestinian uprising known as the "intifada"
was considered to be losing momentum and direction. "The
intifada was almost at a stalemate," says Palestinian
journalist Abdul Magid Abu Ghosh. "But Saddam has boosted
morale, and given it new force."
   Yet while the Palestinians are elated at the prospect of a
strong, new, Arab leader endorsing their cause, some Arab and
other leaders are beginning to fear that Palestine Liberation
Organization head Yasser Arafat's alliance with Saddam
Hussein may prove politically suicidal in the long run.
   "There is little doubt, the PLO will pay a price," says
Palestinian activist Daoud Kuttab in East Jerusalem. "The
sentiment in the West Bank and Gaza was just so strong. It
was like a flood, but it may be that the Palestinians have
made a mistake."
   Mr. Arafat's support for the Iraqi invasion may have won
him popularity among Palestinians, but it has hurt him
elsewhere and has even stirred opposition within the PLO.
Diplomats familiar with the thinking of Arab leaders say
support remains strong for the Palestinian cause, but that
some nations will be more reluctant to continue bankrolling
any organization led by Mr. Arafat. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
refused to meet him when he was in Jiddah last week.
   In addition to the loss of financial backing, hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians employed in the gulf states may
find their jobs in jeopardy. "Many will likely be fired,"
says Mr. Kuttab.
   In Europe too, there has been some fallout for the
Palestinians. Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, who has
been meeting with European leaders, says several nations are
reconsidering their support for the PLO. Italy's Foreign
Minister Gianni de Michelis said that if Mr. Arafat doesn't
renounce his support for Saddam Hussein, Italy will "revise
its attitude toward the PLO."
   At a time when the intifada had begun to win sympathy
abroad, thereby increasing U.S. pressure on Israel to
negotiate with the Palestinians, this setback in public
opinion is elating the Israelis. Israeli and Arab officials
now agree that given the distraction of events in the gulf,
and the pro-Iraqi stand taken by Mr. Arafat, the sputtering
peace talks will stall even further.
   "It just underlines what we've said all along," says Avi
Pazner, communications adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir. "The threat to the region isn't from Israeli friction
with the Palestinians, but from the behavior of some Arab
countries, like Iraq."
   Although Mr. Pazner voices the official Israeli line that
he doesn't wish to see the peace talks derailed, he
nonetheless says that "it is difficult to see how the
Palestinians, who are very pro-Saddam Hussein, can talk with
us calmly now. The situation is very heated, and these talks
require a calm atmosphere." Israel's deputy foreign minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, says, "The intentions of the PLO and Iraq
are the same: the liquidation of Israel."
   Some Palestinian leaders have begun to try to shade their
support for Iraq. The inconsistency of Palestinian support of
Baghdad's taking of land by force, while insisting that
Israel has wrongly done the same thing, strains logic. Faisal
Husseini, a Palestinian activist in Jerusalem, says somewhat
cryptically over a cup of thick, sweet Turkish coffee, "We
are, in a way, for Iraq and against Kuwait, and also, for
Kuwait and against Iraq."
   But out in the tank and donkey-trampled streets of the
Israeli-occupied territories, no such moderation is to be
found. Saddam Hussein's twin messages of anti-Americanism and
Pan-Arabism, as well as his inflaming of resentment between
the Arab haves and have-nots, plays to an avid audience. So
strong is the feeling, several residents of Ramallah suggest
they would have turned on Mr. Arafat had he not sided with
Iraq.
   "The support for Saddam is very strong here," says a
teenager. "Saddam is a hero. Many of us would like to fight
for him."
   "Saddam Hussein is a shah, he is our godfather," says a
toothless builder, Jasser Shahin, sitting on a shaded porch
in the steep, rocky town of Ein Arik. "What we want is for
him to unite all Arabs as a superpower." Reflecting the view
of impoverished Palestinians that Saddam Hussein is an Arab
Robin Hood, he says:
   "We aren't benefiting from the sheiks' oil. Saddam wants
the whole Arab world to share. I hear one emir spent half a
million dollars sending his cat to London, while people here
don't have enough to eat."
   Educated Palestinians in the occupied territories are
equally enthusiastic about Saddam Hussein, although some see
risks. Lawyer Shukri Aboud, who is close to the Palestine
Liberation Front, hangs a photo of Saddam Hussein in his
Ramallah living room. If there is a conventional war against
the U.S., he thinks Iraq may win. But he worries that if not,
the Palestinian fate will be buried along with Iraq's.
   "We Palestinians cannot bear one more defeat," he says.
"It would consecrate the Israeli occupation for at least
another hundred years."
   Given such risks, the Ramallah journalist, Mr. Ghosh,
struggles to explain why the Palestinians have thrown in
their lot with Iraq. He says Palestinians watched warily as
Mr. Arafat made concessions last year in an effort to reach
peace with Israel. "He took almost all his clothes off in
front of the whole world, and still got nothing," Mr. Ghosh
says. "We have tried negotiations. What else can we do?"

   Failing hope that the standoff over Kuwait will be
resolved soon sent the over-the-counter market into another
tailspin yesterday.
   Traders say they have dumped whatever stock they can get
rid of so that they aren't exposed to any further short-term
price shocks. But institutional investors are edging toward
the door as well, traders say.
</LP>

   "There are institutions that say `I've held on so far
waiting to see what happens, and now I don't like what I'm
seeing,' " says William R. Rothe, head of OTC trading at
Alex. Brown &amp; Sons. Mr. Rothe says those investors are now
beginning to sell.
   But with traders unwilling to hold stock for long and the
market bare of buyers, any stock for sale exacerbates the
price slide.
   That's what happened yesterday when the Nasdaq Composite
Index lost its grip in the afternoon and tumbled 9.18 points,
or 2.23%, to 402.27.
   The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell about 2%.
   Volume increased to 114.9 million shares from Wednesday's
light volume of 105.2 million shares.
   OTC advancers trailed decliners, 586 to 1,398.
   Traders say the market was unnerved by Iraq's call
yesterday afternoon for U.S. citizens in Kuwait to assemble,
fearing that the move is a step further toward making them
hostages.
   Meanwhile, a growing belief that a recession is either on
its way or under way is eroding the underlying support for
stock prices.
   Reuters' ADR's topped the most-active list on volume of
nearly three million shares. The international news and
financial information services company dropped 6 3/8, or more
than 10%, to 51 3/8, after Wertheim Schroder removed the
stock from its recommended list. The Wertheim action
apparently arose from concerns that Reuters is having
problems with its new Dealing 2000-2 foreign exchange trading
system.
   A Reuters' spokesman disputed reports that there are
problems with the system, however. The spokesman said results
of first-phase testing of the system are "on the whole quite
positive."
   First Executive fell 9/16 to 1 13/16. The insurance
company voted to pay dividends on its preferred stock issues.
Those dividends were thrown into doubt Wednesday when it was
disclosed that the company was considering not making further
payments on its preferred stock in order to conserve cash. In
1989, First Executive paid out about $44 million in dividends
on its various classes of preferred stock.
   Northeast Bancorp fell 5 1/4 points to 12 1/4 after the
Federal Reserve Board appeared to have nailed the coffin shut
on the bank's merger agreement with Bank of New York.
Wednesday, the Fed denied Bank of New York's petition to
acquire Northeast in the merger, which has been pending for
more than six years. The merger has been in jeopardy since
the two banks disagreed over Northeast's book value earlier
this year.
   National Savings Bank of Albany tumbled 5 3/4 to 20 after
Trustco Bank said it has ended its efforts to buy National
Savings. Trustco said it made six offers for the bank, all of
which have been rejected. Trustco most recently offered 1.3
of its shares for each share of National Savings' stock.
Trustco ended unchanged at 28.
   Lotus Development dove 2 1/4 to 17 after Goldman Sachs and
Kidder Peabody each cut their third-quarter earnings
estimates for the company.
   The initial public offering of Marcam, an application
software company focused on the manufacturing industry, got a
warm welcome from Wall Street. The 1.26 million-share
offering, which was priced at $14 a share, began trading
yesterday at 15 and quickly rose to a high of 19 1/2. The
stock ended the day at 18 on volume of more than 1.5 million
shares.
   Ohio Casualty gained 1/4 to 41 3/4 after announcing a
buy-back of an additional 1.5 million of its shares.
   Florida-based First Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Association added 7/8 to 18 7/8.
   Huntington Bancshares said it has received all necessary
regulatory approvals for its acquisition of First Home
Federal.
   Spire slid 3/8 to 3 after reporting Wednesday that its
second quarter profit fell to $12,800 from $130,000 a year
ago.
   Emulex added 3/8 to 6 3/8 after reporting fiscal fourth
quarter net income of 10 cents a share, compared with 20
cents a year ago. The earnings were better than analysts had
expected, however.
   DS Bancor rose 1/2 to 8 3/8. The company said a
Connecticut businessman holds a 7.2% stake in the bank and
intends to acquire more. DS Bancor said the investor's
objectives are compatible with those of the bank's board and
management.

   The Federal Trade Commission accused the nation's major

set a precise value on, rare coins.
   Merrill Lynch, for example, is in the midst of marketing
to investors the $50 million NFA World Coin Fund, a limited
partnership that will invest in rare U.S. and foreign coins.
Professional Coin-graded coins will be among those purchased
by the fund, Merrill Lynch says in the fund prospectus. It
points to Professional Coin and other grading concerns to
assure investors of the relative safety of the rare-coin
market. So far, Merrill Lynch has raised $15 million for the
fund.
   But in the civil lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in
Washington, the FTC charges that Professional Coin "engaged
in numerous violations" of the Federal Trade Commission Act
in its television and newspaper advertisements and in
promotional materials. The FTC said that Professional Coin,
among other things, hasn't provided the "objective or
consistent grading" it claims, and that the company has
misrepresented itself because "PCGS does not in all cases
observe its `strict anti-self interest policy.'"
   Professional Coin, at the same time the lawsuit was filed,
entered into a consent decree in which it agreed to various
actions, including a mandatory disclosure statement in all
promotional materials: "Certification by PCGS does not
guarantee protection against the normal risks associated with
potentially volatile markets." In settling, Professional Coin
didn't admit liability for the alleged offenses.
   Professional Coin's chief executive officer, David Hall, a
California coin dealer, said: "We see ourselves as good guys,
doing our part to try and make sure coin buyers get a
properly represented product. It seemed unbelievable that we
could be the target of an FTC investigation." He said the FTC
has been investigating the grading concern for three years.
   Mr. Hall said that the FTC complaint "contains some
obviously untrue allegations," but that Professional Coin
settled the case to save court costs. "I'm convinced PCGS
runs the cleanest ship in the grading service business," he
said.
   Improper grading has long been one of the rare-coin
industry's big problems and the cause of numerous
consumer-fraud cases. (Rare-coin collectors, who buy coins
based on rarity and quality, are different from investors who
buy gold, silver and platinum bullion coins priced on their
metal content.)
   Rare-coin buyers are defrauded out of millions of dollars
each year, some regulators and dealers say, when unscrupulous
dealers assign higher-than-warranted grades to boost the
sales prices of their merchandise, while downgrading coins
they purchase to lower the prices they have to pay.
   All this was supposed to be changed under the Professional
Coin system, in which at least three rare-coin experts would
study each coin and make a consensus grade; the coin would
then be sealed in a tamper-resistant plastic "slab" with a
serial number and other identifying data.
   Rare coins are typically classified according to their
condition on a scale that runs from MS-1 to MS-70, with MS
standing for "mint state" and MS-70 signifying almost
unattainable perfection. A slight difference in
classification can change a rare coin's value by thousands of
dollars.
   "Probably the most significant thing about the case is
that coin graders, dealers and certifiers have to be very
careful about the messages they give to the buying public,"
said Phoebe Morse, head of the FTC's Boston office, which
brought the case. "They haven't been careful enough."
   Barry J. Cutler, director of the FTC's bureau of consumer
protection, said the new grading concerns have benefits for
small investors. But they "are being marketed, at least by
PCGS, as providing so much objectivity and so much liquidity,
that it has lured Wall Street into the picture for the first
time," he said. "I want to make sure that Wall Street
brokerages aren't lulled into a false sense of confidence
about the degree of risk."
   Since its founding in 1986, Professional Coin and its
nationwide network of participating dealers have been telling
investors that the company grades coins with consistency so
they can be bought and sold "sight unseen" as confidently as
any other commodity.
   Critics, from the start, have warned of potential
conflicts of interest with Professional Coin, because it is
owned and run by dealers who buy and sell coins. These
critics say the temptation is too great to grade a favored
customer's coins higher than they should be.
   Professional Coin's avowed "anti-bias" policy is a key
part of the FTC complaint. In its lawsuit, the agency accuses
Professional Coin of not living up to its claim that it takes
"all feasible steps to insure that no one involved in the
grading process ever knows the identity of the coin's owner."
But the FTC complaint doesn't spell out any alleged
improprieties, such as favoritism to dealers or customers.
   The FTC has been investigating coin-grading services as
part of a crackdown on coin fraud. Last year, the agency
obtained a consent decree from another large independent
grader, Numismatic Certification Institute, and its parent,
Heritage Capital Corp. of Dallas. The FTC said the grader,
among other things, misled customers about its grading
standards.
   The action against Professional Coin could be a boost for
its chief rival, Numismatic Guaranty Corp. of America, which
is based in Parsippany, N.J., and run by John Albanese, a
Professional Coin founder who left that organization soon
after its launch. Some dealers have boycotted Numismatic
Guaranty, complaining that its standards are too high, so the
coins it grades can't be sold for as much.
   Another major grading service is run by the American
Numismatic Association, a trade group for dealers and
collectors.
   Merrill Lynch's NFA World Coin Fund already has bought
some Professional Coin-graded coins for its portfolio, said
Frank J. Carr, the fund's chief financial officer. He said
Merrill Lynch trusts Professional Coin. "Unless there's some
revelation" about the service, he said the fund doesn't
believe it has to make any changes in its prospectus or the
fund's operations. "We have no reason to believe there will
be any problem," he said.
   Last year, Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. led Wall Street's move
into the coin business by marketing a $40 million American
Rare Coin Fund limited partnership. Kidder, a unit of General
Electric Co., also pointed to the success of Professional
Coin and other grading services. A Kidder spokeswoman said,
"Any problems that may arise with PCGS should not affect the
intrinsic value of the coins themselves."
   The FTC has complained about widespread abuse by dealers
of Salomon Brothers Inc.'s index of 20 rare-coin prices. The
index of 20 very-rare and valuable silver coins shows a
whopping 17.3% compound annual rate of return over the past
two decades, much better than stocks or bonds. But this
doesn't necessarily reflect the performance of the coin
market as a whole, the FTC has warned.
   "Using the Salomon Brothers index as comparison for the
coins that most consumers use for investment is a little like
using their art index, which may reflect the price of van
Goghs, and assuming it will be the same for Dali prints," the
FTC's Mr. Cutler said.

   Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said
it will begin basic research next year on a
photovoltaic-power system in space to capture the energy of
the sun and send it back to Earth.
   Solar-power units stationed in space would be more
efficient than ground-based photovoltaic-power systems,
officials told a Japanese news agency. They explained that
while much of the sun's energy is filtered out by the Earth's
atmosphere and clouds, that wouldn't happen in space.
   The project envisions a generator equipped with a
solar-panel unit in geostationary orbit. A panel unit of
three to six square miles would generate five million
kilowatts, roughly equivalent to the output of about five
nuclear-power stations, the officials said.
   Energy captured by the solar-panel unit would be sent by
microwave signals or laser to a ground-based receiver.
                                                                                                       

   ASIAN TOURISM FEARS
                                                                                                       

   Member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations may have to adjust their tourism projections because
of the anticipated drop in tourist traffic due to higher oil
prices resulting from the Persian Gulf crisis, industry
sources said. The 1992 Visit ASEAN Year working committee is
scheduled to discuss its marketing plan in Kuala Lumpur this
month.

   The ruling Frelimo party's central committee has endorsed
resolutions calling for adoption of a multiparty system and
new election laws, meeting a key demand of rebels fighting
the government, the Mozambique government news agency said.
President Joaquim Chissano said on July 31 he wanted a
multiple party system in place for parliamentary and
presidential elections next year.

   The Philippine government will lift an eight-year ban on
Soviet ships at a shipyard near the U.S. naval base at Subic
Bay, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon told a Japanese news
agency. Shipyard restrictions on vessels from the Soviet
Union and other East bloc countries were imposed in 1982 at
the request of the U.S.
                                                                                                       

   MONKEY BUSINESS
                                                                                                       

   An Australian city is considering using monkeys to pick
coconuts from trees along its seafront walk to prevent the
nuts from falling on tourists. "They'd splatter you if they
hit you. It's bloody frightening," said Les Bass, a spokesman
for palm-fringed Cairns City Council in northeast Australia.
Using monkeys, possibly from Malaysia, was proposed by
Alderman Bob Burgess, who suggested they would amuse tourists
while protecting sightseers and picnickers from lethal cracks
on the head.
                                                                                                       

   SAMSUNG PLAN REJECTED
                                                                                                       

   The South Korean Trade and Industry Ministry rejected a
plan by Samsung Shipbuilding &amp; Heavy Industries Co. to
produce large trucks using Japanese technology. Ministry
officials said the application to introduce technology from
Nissan Diesel Motor Co. would be returned to Samsung.

   While China pleads with its teeming millions to have just
one child per couple, across the border in sparsely populated
Mongolia it's the more the merrier.
   "Children are the flowers of our life," said "hero mother"
Orsoo, expressing a common Mongolian sentiment. "They are our
future." The 50-year-old mother of 10 and her husband
received a government loan to build a new home as a reward
for having a large family. Mrs. Orsoo, winner of a red star
medal, said families of eight or more also get $300 a year in
government subsidies, a princely sum in Mongolia.
   Mongolia's communist rulers until recently prohibited
birth control. Activists, such as prominent pediatrician and
public health official Munkhuu, have pushed the authorities
in the past year to legalize contraceptives, saying Mongolian
women are risking their health because they have too many
babies too quickly. Legalization of contraception is one of
many reforms instituted since March, when demonstrations
forced the communists to renounce their monopoly on power.
   However, official approval of large families remains
unchanged. "Our birth-control policy was and is one of
encouraging population growth, because our population is so
small," Mr. Munkhuu said.
   Mongolia, a country the size of Western Europe, has a
population of only two million. Its birthrate is high at 36
births per 1,000 people, and the average family has about
five children.

   A Bank of China vice president, Lei Zufa, was publicly
reprimanded by the government for lavish entertaining at
state expense, the official radio reported. The banker and an
unspecified number of diners were ordered to reimburse the
government for $1,590 spent at three recent banquets. . . .
West Germany's Kunsthalle Bremen museum said it expects to
recover soon 362 valuable drawings and watercolors taken to
the Soviet Union during World War II, including works by
Durer, Rubens and Van Gogh.

   Sears Planning
   To Reduce Jobs
   By Thousands
   ---
   Cutbacks Are Said to Focus
   On Non-Selling Workers
   And Headquarters Staff

BROADLINE RETAILERS, DEPARTMENT STORES (RTB)
</IN>
<LP>
   CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., moving swiftly to cut
costs and improve retailing profits, plans to eliminate
thousands of jobs over the next several months.
   The retailing and financial services concern is understood
to be targeting administrative staff members at its
headquarters here as well as employees who perform
non-selling duties at its 850 U.S. stores. An individual
familiar with the plan said Sears hasn't determined yet
exactly how many of its 337,000 U.S. merchandising employees
will be fired.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the individual said Sears expects the job cuts to
result in annual savings of more than $100 million.
   And that's apparently just the beginning as Chairman
Edward A. Brennan seeks to turn around the company's
faltering retailing business. In a management shakeup last
week, Mr. Brennan reassumed day-to-day control of the $31
billion-a-year merchandise group and vowed to cut costs.
   A Sears spokesman said only that "Mr. Brennan is looking
at all opportunities to enhance revenues, improve margins and
reduce costs in all areas. This review is ongoing and no
final decisions have been made."
   Sears executives are now understood to agree privately
with analysts that it must reduce expenses by at least $500
million annually to become competitive. That's because,
despite years of trimming costs, Sears's operating expenses
are still among the highest in retailing. Last year, those
expenses consumed 30 cents of every Sears retail sales
dollar, compared with 23 cents at K mart Corp. and 16 cents
at Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
   "More than ever, they're questioning the way they did
things -- all the safety nets," said another individual
familiar with the situation. Sears "has a business system
that is more complicated than it has to be."
   The first step involves cutting corporate overhead by
combining the company's corporate and merchandise group
headquarters staffs. By year end, the company expects to
eliminate overlapping jobs in such departments as personnel,
finance and planning, including some jobs at the officer
level, according to an individual familiar with the plan. The
600-member corporate staff previously oversaw both the core
merchandise group and Sears's financial service operations.
These include its Allstate insurance, Dean Witter brokerage
and Coldwell Banker real estate units.
   Sears also intends to eliminate thousands of non-selling
jobs at its stores, mostly in 1991. Workers who perform such
duties as receiving and stocking merchandise and staffing
customer service and personnel offices now account for as
many as a third of a store's employees, the individual said.
At most department stores and other mass-merchandising
chains, non-selling employees make up less than 20% of a
store's work force.
   Sears officials believe relying more on automation will
reduce the number of non-selling employees. The approach was
recommended by an outside consultant, the Garr Associates
unit of Deloitte &amp; Touche, hired by Sears late last year.
Some of Sears's competitors such as crosstown rival
Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. already are trimming their costs with
such a system.
   People familiar with the situation, in fact, say Sears
broke off merger talks with Montgomery Ward because Sears
executives concluded they could cut costs on their own. As
reported earlier, Montgomery Ward's chief executive officer,
Bernard Brennan, approached Sears two months ago about
merging Ward into Sears, but he wanted to run the whole show.
The two Brennans are brothers.
   Sears executives are understood to have recognized that
Bernard Brennan could have taken an ax to costs as he has at
Ward. But that would have been an admission of failure on
their part. Sears executives also are understood to have been
troubled by Ward's flat sales over the past several months.
   The talks nevertheless forced Sears executives to
recognize that their company desperately needs to become more
efficient -- and fast. Ward had "at least a three-year head
start" in areas such as reducing non-selling expenses in its
stores, one of the individuals said.
   Sears stock closed yesterday at $29.875, off 75 cents, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   Michaels Stores Gives
   Sam Wyly Added Post
   Of Chief Executive

   DALLAS -- Sam Wyly, unsuccessful in his plan last year to
sell Michaels Stores Inc., a company controlled by his
family, was named chief executive officer in a reorganization
that he said "represents a long-term Wyly commitment to
Michaels."
   As part of the reorganization, Mr. Wyly said he named
Donald G. Thomson president and also rehired Michael J. Dupey
-- founder of Michaels -- with whom Wyly had a falling out
several years ago. "We were married and we got divorced and
we are getting married again," said Mr. Wyly, who has been
chairman of the company since 1984. Mr. Dupey will serve as
an adviser.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The moves come after two years of disappointment for the
chain of arts-and-crafts retail stores. In fiscal 1989 the
company had profit of only $5.2 million, or 50 cents a share,
on sales of almost $250 million, and in fiscal 1990, ended
Jan. 28, earnings fell to $13,000 on sales of almost $290
million. Last year's earnings were hurt because of expenses
incurred in the failed acquisition by MSI Holdings Inc., an
investment group thwarted by the troubled junk-bond market
and by Michaels' own poor performance.
   Mr. Wyly, who with his family holds a 39% stake in
Michaels, said the company is no longer for sale. "We are now
committed to owning a company," he said, adding that the
primary objective is "to improve the yield we get on our
assets." He predicted that fiscal 1991 results would be
"significantly better" than those in the previous year.
   Mr. Wyly said that as chief executive he would devote more
time to Michaels. But Mr. Wyly, who is also chairman of
Dallas-based Sterling Software Inc., said Michaels would be
run primarily by Mr. Thomson, a Michaels director and
longtime business consultant to the Wyly family.
   As chief executive and president, Mr. Wyly and Mr. Thomson
are succeeding B.B. Tuley, who has held those posts since
1986. Mr. Wyly, who recruited Mr. Tuley to Michaels in 1984,
said the two of them reached "a mutual decision" for Mr.
Tuley to resign. "It was time for a change," said Mr. Wyly.
Mr. Tuley couldn't be reached for comment.
   Observers say a management change couldn't hurt. "Two
Christmases ago they had too much inventory and had to reduce
it at distressed prices, then the reverse happened last
Christmas -- inventories were too low," says Dennis Telzrow,
a retail analyst for Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner.
   Those are the types of wrinkles that Mr. Dupey, the
Michaels founder, might iron out. As the man "largely
responsible for creating today's arts, crafts and hobby
industry," Mr. Dupey will advise the company on the selection
and marketing of seasonal and promotional merchandise, Mr.
Wyly said.

   Philip Morris Picks
   Viault to Be Chief
   Of Jacobs Suchard

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Philip Morris Cos. moved closer to its planned
$3.8 billion acquisition of Swiss chocolate and coffee
company Jacobs Suchard AG, and appointed the architect of a
turnaround at its Maxwell House Coffee Co. to run the
European company.
   The U.S. tobacco and consumer products company said it
completed its acquisition of Colima Holding AG, a closely
held company that controls 62% of the voting rights of
Suchard. Through Colima, Philip Morris is making a tender
offer for the balance of Suchard's shares outstanding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the same time, the Suchard board named Raymond Viault
as chief executive officer of Jacobs Suchard, which is now an
operating unit of Philip Morris's Kraft General Foods
subsidiary.
   Mr. Viault, 46 years old, had previously served as
president of Kraft General Foods' Maxwell House Coffee Co.
While at Maxwell House, which accounts for 22.2% of Kraft
General Foods' U.S. business, Mr. Viault helped engineer a
turnaround of the unit's lagging domestic coffee business.
   By boosting the quality of the beans used in its Maxwell
House brand, and by rolling out such new products as Maxwell
House Rich French Roast, Maxwell House Colombian Supreme and
Maxwell House 1882, the company saw its market share begin to
climb in the past year. Together, its brands now account for
about 34.6% of the domestic coffee market, making Maxwell
House the nation's largest coffee manufacturer.
   At Suchard, Mr. Viault will oversee a trove of brands that
includes the Jacobs Cafe, and Night and Day coffees, and the
Toblerone and Milka brands of chocolate. When Philip Morris
announced the acquisition in June, it said it hoped Suchard
would allow it to build Pan-European brands.
   To succeed Mr. Viault, Kraft General Foods named Charles
Phillips as president of Maxwell House. Mr. Phillips, 45, has
spent his entire career at General Foods, climbing through
financial and marketing positions at Maxwell House and other
Kraft General Foods' units. Most recently, he served as Kraft
General Foods' president for Latin America, Eastern Europe,
the Middle East and Africa.
   To maintain Maxwell House's momentum in the U.S. market,
Mr. Phillips vows to step up the company's new product
initiatives. He said the company is already testing a
liquid-coffee concentrate and a fully prepared liquid coffee,
each designed to be heated in microwave ovens. The company is
also testing both canned and bottled versions of an
iced-coffee product called Cappio.
   Industry experts say further gains in the U.S. coffee
business may be difficult, however. Consumption of coffee in
the U.S. has dropped for more than a decade, as younger
consumers have turned to sweet drinks for their morning
beverage.
   But Mr. Phillips maintains Maxwell House's new initiatives
will lure back soda drinkers. "We just have to find new ways
to deliver the benefits of coffee to young people," Mr.
Phillips said. "We've given that market away without a
fight."

acting chief executive officer, was elected president, chief
executive and a director of this maker of pollution-control
systems, succeeding Glendon E. Rose, who resigned for
personal reasons. Mr. Everett, who served in the same roles
for many years, had retired in January of this year, but
returned in June after Mr. Rose was hospitalized for surgery.

   No Need to Balk at Baseball Stock

   George Steinbrenner is taking a lot of abuse these days,
and it's safe to say he deserves most of what he's getting.
To many fans, he's the Nicolae Ceausescu of major league
baseball. But before we take George out to the courtyard and
shoot him, we should consider some of the other people
running professional teams in this country. Mr. Steinbrenner
may be a nightmare, but he is only marginally worse than many
of the others.
   I'm thinking of people like Bob Irsay, the Indianapolis
Colts owner who is nothing more than a bad advertisement for
Mayflower Movers. Then there is Al Davis of the football
Raiders, an itinerant man who wouldn't know loyalty if it
gave him a forearm shiver. San Diego Padres owner Tom Werner
has only been in the fraternity for a couple of months, but
already he's shown big league stuff. He's the one who asked
Roseanne Barr to sing the national anthem.

<TEXT>
   As a group, team owners have done more damage to pro
sports than domed stadiums. They have demonstrated
unbelievable contempt for fans, and their loutish behavior
has taken much of the fun out of our games. Resentment builds
with every ticket-price increase, with every lockout, with
every cable television contract that shuts out more free
television viewers, with every second division team that
makes millions no matter how poorly it plays.
   I propose we get rid of these egotistical deadbeats. We
should take our teams away from the owners and put them
instead in public hands. That won't be easy to pull off. But
if we've learned anything from the dramatic events of the
past few years, it is that the will of an oppressed and
wronged people should never be underestimated. Wasn't it just
months ago that Ceausescu was still commissioning statues of
himself, and his wife Elena redecorating the Summer Palace?
   It's time for sports fans to revolt. We should take to the
streets in big league cities all over the country. We should
picket stadiums, shun concessions, forsake games, tie up
traffic. We should do all this in an effort to force the
owners to sell their teams to the public in a series of stock
offerings.
   This would be a terrific deal for all involved. Investors
would get pieces of their favorite teams as well as stakes in
thriving monopolies. Initial stock prices would be set to
fetch each team's current market value, and given that
franchise values have been appreciating faster than Pete Rose
can say, "Bookmaker," there isn't an owner who wouldn't make
millions. To be fair, they could retain a piece of their
former teams, but no one person or organization could hold
more than, say 5% of the shares. That would prevent a return
to the sort of autocracies that exist today.
   Before selling out, owners would sit down with
representatives of the league offices and put together a
10-person board of directors for each team. The board would
need no special expertise in sports, but rather just a sense
of civic responsibility and the ability to assemble a
competent management team. League offices would be involved
in this process to ensure that outgoing owners don't fill the
boardrooms with cronies.
   The team board of directors would function like any
corporate board. The would be subject to election by the
shareholders. They would be responsible for hiring the top
executives, who would then put together staffs. Shareholders
would have nothing to do with player personnel moves or
coaching decisions -- but would of course retain the ability
to sell or buy when necessary. Some profit would be passed on
in the form of dividends. The rest would go back into the
organization.
   In many cases, even with a change in ownership, an
organization's management rolls may not change at all. A team
like the Oakland A's, for example, is doing well under the
current regime, and there'd be no reason for shareholders to
push for its removal. But perennially feeble franchises like
the Cleveland Indians would likely be overhauled. If the
value of the franchise falls, as it probably would if the
team faltered, then management would be pressured to turn
things around. There'd be no time or place for the sort of
mischief today's owners often make.
   The new ownership structure wouldn't necessarily lock
teams into one city. If a team can't cut it financially, then
a move to another town or a sale to outside investors could
easily be arranged. As discouraging as that would be for
some, at least the move would have been initiated by the
votes of thousands of shareholders, and not just the whim of
a single owner.
   Public ownership won't guarantee anyone a world
championship. But it would give the fans and the communities
a voice. It would give them some recourse. They wouldn't have
to silently endure the sort of dreary mediocrity with which
the Mariners tortured Seattle for a dozen years. They
wouldn't have to pay ransoms in tax breaks and bond issues to
keep threatening owners from bolting to other towns. An Al
Davis -- or a George Steinbrenner -- would never be able to
break the fans' hearts again.

   Claims of Blood Disorder
   Contracted From Firm's
   Product Could Increase

   TOKYO -- Lawsuits filed by the American victims of a rare
blood disorder have cast a new shadow over Japan's
third-largest chemical producer.
   Showa Denko K.K. confirmed last week that a total of 89
suits have been filed against it in the U.S. by victims of
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or EMS, a blood disorder that
causes severe muscle pain, neurological damage and, in some
cases, death.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition to hurting the company's financial prospects,
the claims have undermined Showa Denko's struggle to shed the
reputation for arrogance and social irresponsibility it
earned in losing a 1971 pollution suit in Japan.
   A record number of cases of EMS were reported in the U.S.
last year, and American researchers now believe that Showa
Denko is to blame. Two studies, one published last month in
the Journal of the American Medical Association and a second
in last week's New England Journal of Medicine, linked the
crippling disorder to allegedly contaminated batches of
L-tryptophan, an amino acid produced by Showa Denko in the
first three months of 1989.
   Claims against the company and its U.S. subsidiary, Showa
Denko America Inc., total $810 million so far, company
officials say. But that amount may balloon if the more than
1,400 other Americans who contracted the blood disorder after
using products made from Showa Denko's amino acids also seek
compensation. Showa Denko is contesting the suits.
   Senior management at corporate headquarters in Tokyo
declined requests to be interviewed. A spokesman denied that
the company was negligent, insisting that it is dealing
responsibly with the situation. "We are cooperating fully
with health officials in the U.S. and Japan to determine the
origins of the disorder," he said.
   Showa Denko officials confirm that 1,535 people who took
dietary supplements containing L-tryptophan manufactured by
the company later showed symptoms of the blood disease. To
date, 27 people have died. (Only two L-tryptophan-related
cases of EMS have been reported in Japan, but dietary
supplements in pill form aren't popular among Japanese
consumers.)
   But the company says the statistical correlation between
ingestion of its amino acids and contraction of EMS doesn't
prove conclusively that they caused the disease.
"Ninety-seven percent isn't the same as 100%," says Robert
Schwadron, a spokesman for Showa Denko America. He says an
animal model is needed to demonstrate a causal relationship.
   In April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the
Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare banned the sale of
L-tryptophan. Showa Denko voluntarily suspended the
manufacture and export of the substance last November as soon
as medical reports suggested that it might be related to the
disorder.
   It could be years before claims against Showa Denko are
settled in U.S. courts, but analysts here agree that the
burden of compensating EMS victims could devastate the
company financially. In the year ended last December, Showa
Denko reported sales of 526 billion yen ($3.5 billion),
recurring profits of 33.5 billion yen ($223 million) and
liquid assets of about 50 billion yen ($333 million).
   "The arithmetic is pretty simple," says Colin Talcroft, an
analyst who follows the chemical industry for Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Securities (Japan) Ltd. A liability judgment
greater than 100 billion yen probably wouldn't force Showa
Denko into bankruptcy, Mr. Talcroft says, but it would "wipe
out liquid assets and put the company in a very, very
difficult position."
   Some analysts think the company's legal battles in the
U.S. may force it to cancel or postpone indefinitely plans to
construct a mammoth, 100 billion yen ethylene plant in
southern Japan.
   As if those troubles weren't enough, Iraq's surprise
invasion of Kuwait has severed Showa Denko from its major
supplier of naptha, the raw material most important to the
company's manufacturing operations. Showa Denko depended on
Kuwait for 30% of its naptha, and Tommy Tang, an analyst with
Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd., estimates that the cost of
finding new sources will reduce the company's 1990 profits by
at least 3 billion yen.
   Showa Denko got its start in 1939 as a processor of animal
fertilizer in rural Kyushu in southern Japan. After World War
II, the company prospered under the leadership of its
hard-driving founder, Haruo Suzuki, diversifying into
manufacturing petrochemical and aluminum products in the
mid-1960s.
   Petrochemicals such as ethylene and polystyrene account
for 46% of Showa Denko sales, while inorganic materials such
as ceramics and aluminum account for 36%. About 10 years ago,
Showa Denko, like Japan's other big chemical makers, began
diversifying into biotechnology products with higher profit
margins, such as L-tryptophan. Still, L-tryptophan has never
accounted for more than 1% of the company's revenues.
   Oddly, Showa Denko's legal problems in the U.S. haven't
had much effect on the company's stock price in Japan. Though
the stock is down about 40% from its price just before first
American studies linking EMS with L-tryptophan, the Japanese
chemical industry as a whole is also down almost 40%.
   The earlier pollution suit against the company was filed
in 1967 by 77 residents of Niigata City on Japan's western
coast. They charged that a Showa Denko chemical plant had
dumped mercury into a river that passes through the town,
causing excruciatingly painful bone and nervous system
disorders among residents who had eaten fish from the river.
   Showa Denko executives openly defied efforts by the
Ministry of Health and Welfare to investigate the case.
Shortly after the suit was filed, Showa Denko's president
declared on national television that his company wouldn't
accept the conclusions of the government's investigation no
matter what its outcome was, and that it planned to disregard
any government orders to modify its manufacturing operations.
   To hinder progress of the investigation, Showa Denko
officials swiftly dismantled the entire plant, and ordered
the destruction of company documents with details of its
manufacturing processes. They also destroyed waste water
samples taken from the site.
   The cover-up attempt backfired. In a landmark decision
handed down in 1971, the Niigata District Court ruled against
Showa Denko, arguing that the company had deprived itself of
the only evidence that might have absolved it of blame. The
judgment set an important legal precedent in Japan, and
opened the door for a host of similar suits against other big
polluters.

   Security Pacific
   Sees Problems
   For 2nd-Half Net

   LOS ANGELES -- Security Pacific Corp. said overall
weakness in the economy would crimp its earnings for the
remainder of the year.
   The bank holding company wouldn't make specific estimates.
But John Kooken, chief financial officer, said Security
Pacific at best expects net income for the second half to
grow less than the 5% increase recorded in profit for the
first six months. Mr. Kooken also said profit for the second
half could be below year-earlier levels.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the first six months, Security Pacific earned $195.2
million, or $1.59 a share. In last year's second half, the
company earned $376.8 million, or $3.14 a share. For all of
1989, profit was $740.6 million, or $6.26 a share.
   The announcement rocked Security Pacific's stock and
prompted several analysts to lower their 1990 earnings
forecasts for the company. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Security Pacific closed at
$28.75, off $3.
   Livia Asher, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Research/U.S.,
trimmed her 1990 estimate by 65 cents a share, to $5.70. For
1991, she cut her estimate by 60 cents, to $6.20 a share.
   Mr. Kooken and other Security Pacific officials were
dismayed by the stock's plunge. "We certainly feel that the
market has overreacted," Mr. Kooken said. "The reaction is
not borne out by the facts."
   He said the market may have interpreted the disclosure as
evidence of a swoon in California real estate. Many investors
have been dreading such a downturn because California is
about the only regional real estate market in the country
that hasn't tanked. Recently, several large California
thrifts and some banks have reported losses because of
trouble in California. But Mr. Kooken said the California
real estate market, as well as the local economy, remain
relatively strong.
   He attributed the projected slow second half to weakness
in the general economy and said that first-half profit was
pumped up by unusually high non-interest income. He said loan
charge-offs in each of the third and fourth quarters are
likely to match the $160 million Security Pacific reported in
the second quarter. By comparison, the company reported only
$115 million of loan losses in the first quarter.
   Separately, Security Pacific said it agreed to sell $100
million of 8.85% notes, maturing Aug. 15, 1993, and
non-callable over the life of the issue. The notes will be
underwritten by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Lehman
Brothers and Salomon Brothers Inc. Proceeds will be used for
general corporate purposes.

America in their war against the entrenched education
bureaucracy for the hearts -- and more important, the minds
-- of our nation's neediest schoolchildren.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   These young men and women are the vanguard of a new
movement that, using the Peace Corps model, aims to build a
national teacher corps of outstanding, committed individuals
to, as the press kit puts it, "teach America's future." It
has received largely glowing media attention in recent
months, with the New York Times setting the tone in a May 31
editorial: "Amid all the gale-force commencement wind, some
members of the Class of '90 already know that they can make a
living and make a difference."
   But this small, brave contingent is entering a battlefield
already strewn with casualties. After nearly a decade of
reform, our school systems are still failing to educate many
of America's children. American scholastic achievement ranks
low, and teacher morale lower. Many are calling for a
revolutionary change in tactics -- beyond that of sending in
fresh troops -- to rescue American schools from the education
bureaucracy that has held them hostage for so long. Even
though the Teach for America corps members stayed clear of
the ed-school enemy camp as undergrads, what former Education
Secretary William Bennett has called "the Blob" may already
have them in its sights.
   Teach for America's young general, Wendy Kopp, is an
inspiring leader. The 23-year-old outlined her plans for the
organization in her senior thesis at Princeton University in
1989; secured corporate and foundation grants, now totaling
more than $2 million; set up a staff and a recruitment drive,
and saw the corps members, staffers, and 50 members of the
summer faculty come together in Los Angeles for the Summer
Institute, as teacher bootcamp is called.
   Ms. Kopp's aim is fine. As she said in a recent interview,
one week before the end of the Summer Institute: "Just as
companies depend on the quality of their workforce, schools
depend on the quality and creativity and intellectual drive
of the individuals who staff the schools. And they also
depend on the extent to which the nation's leaders also have
a commitment to and experience with the nation's schools."
   But the education bureaucracy -- the enemy -- tends to
dictate the course of the war. For example, Teach for America
has to play by the alternative-certification rules in Los
Angeles, New York, Baton Rouge and New Orleans, and rural
North Carolina and Georgia, the areas it will serve this
school year.
   The rules dictate that members be sent only into those
school districts with persistent teacher shortages. While
this may help the corps' sense of mission, it also means that
the newly minted teachers, most with only five weeks of
mostly half-day student teaching under their belts, will be
sent into places where few teachers want to stay -- often not
because of the race or socioeconomic group of the student
body, but because of an incompetent principal, a balky
custodian, overcrowding or other problems. (New York's
District 4 in East Harlem, which offers a school-choice plan
within its borders, has no trouble retaining teachers.)
   Some have criticized the fact that only 45% of the corps
plans to stay in teaching after the two-year stint is up,
charging dilletantism. But that ignores the real problem. The
average corps member is about 23 years old and has little
work experience of any kind. If she finds she loves teaching,
can close her classroom door and get on with her job, she may
decide against a career in investment banking or the law. But
even those who now plan to spend a lifetime teaching will go
AWOL if they enter a school in which learning is a very low
priority and find that idealism, intelligence and an
understanding of cultural differences can go only so far in a
poisoned, bureaucratic atmosphere. Perhaps Ms. Kopp's model
should have been not the Peace Corps but the Green Berets.
   Instead, corps members this summer received instruction
from a condensed version of the revised standard ed-school
bible, presented in a somewhat more flexible, responsive way
by a faculty of teachers and education professors recruited
from a pool of 500 applicants. "Multiculturalism," the latest
ed-school darling, was one of the three major themes at the
institute, along with "professionalism" and "reflection."
(There are worse things than eight weeks of education classes
-- try a few years of them.)
   Although Teach for America's leaders made much of the wide
range of views represented in its guest lecture series, they
seemed to have acquired the education monopoly's narrow
definition of range. The students heard no prominent reformer
outside the education establishment's mainstream.
   Particularly troubling was the lack of attention paid to
the school-choice movement, which apparently didn't get a
hearing. Not one of the many prominent choice proponents
spoke to the corps. One wonders if corps members have even
heard of John Chubb, of the liberal Brookings Institution,
whose new book on public-school choice showed that choice now
has wide appeal across the political spectrum. Or Polly
Williams, whose fight for school vouchers in inner-city
Milwaukee belies the stereotype that only white, middleclass
parents support choice.
   Also troubling were the rote recitations of the
education-establishment catechism heard from corps and staff:
bilingual education is good; teacher pay is much lower than
that of other college graduates; schools need more money;
multiculturalism -- a revamping of the curriculum to more
fully include non-Western cultures -- will increase student
involvement, self-esteem, tolerance and achievement.
   Corps members didn't hear Linda Chavez, former director of
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, who could counter claims
of bilingualism's efficacy. Or Emily Feistritzer, director of
the National Center for Education Information, who challenges
some of the conventional wisdom on teacher shortages and
teacher pay. Or sociologist James Coleman, who has examined
what makes parochial schools work. Or one of the many
researchers over the years who have countered the common
wisdom that class size, expenditures per pupil and teacher
pay are major factors in student achievement.
   It might even have been beneficial for corps members, who
were presented with rather benign strains of the
multiculturalist theory, to have heard black-supremacist
Leonard Jeffries of City College or other members of New York
state's Task Force on Minorities to see to what extreme,
unicultural ends the theory can be taken.
   Is the corps marching off totally defenseless, then? No,
there are some glimmers of hope.
   Student teaching in the year-round schools of Los Angeles
was probably the most helpful component of the summer
session. Useful too were the small-group "mentoring
sessions," led twice weekly by the summer faculty, which gave
corps members nitty-gritty advice on real teaching problems,
such as ways to deal with school-system red tape.
   The student teaching was an eye-opener for some of the
corps members, as they found that theory and practice are two
different things. This should ease the shock of full-time
teaching. Most worked with good classroom teachers in the Los
Angeles schools to which they were assigned -- a definite
plus. Others worked with incompetents, an education in
itself. (Corps members will be assigned mentors in their new
schools.)
   And Teach for America is revamping the Summer Institute,
based on what was learned this first summer. It wouldn't be
fair to deem the war lost when the first battle is about to
begin.
   Teach for America is aware of the roadblocks its corps
members will face. It is hoping that an esprit de corps
developed over the summer, and is trying to arrange it so
that no member in an urban placement is in a school without a
fellow member there for moral support. In addition, in New
York City, for example, two full-time regional directors will
put out a newsletter and run support workshops -- every week
for the first month and every other week until January. After
that, the schedule will be re-evaluated. The teacher corps
also hopes to set up educational workshops over the course of
the year.
   But the best hope for Teach for America lies with the
troops, who are a bright, able bunch. If given half a chance,
they may be able to use their own resources to navigate
around the education mine fields and do what they want to do
above all else -- teach. And if they fail in this aim, they
may yet succeed in Ms. Kopp's second goal. Battle-weary and
scarred, home from the war, they may become the strongest
proponents of true education reform.

   Merrill Lynch Tactic May Reduce Taxes
   On Assets Sales, but the IRS Is Watching

   NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and a few other financial
institutions are promoting a controversial new tax strategy
that has allowed major U.S. corporations to save hundreds of
millions of dollars in taxes on gains from assets sales.
   The tax strategy typically involves the creation of a
partnership with several investors that generates losses that
a corporation can use to offset its gains on assets sales.
Some of the partnerships include the businesses being sold,
but others don't.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This tax-shelter strategy has been questioned by some tax
lawyers and investment bankers. Some of Merrill's
competitors, including First Boston Corp. and J.P. Morgan &amp;
Co., aren't recommending the technique to clients, saying it
may not withstand scrutiny of the Internal Revenue Service.
   An IRS spokesman said the agency is already "looking into
whether the tax consequences are proper."
   About a dozen big corporations are believed to be pursuing
variations of the tax-shelter strategy. Paramount
Communications Inc. is said to be pursuing the strategy in
connection with the $3.35 billion sale of its Associates
finance unit last year.
   Paramount won't comment on its tax strategies. Paramount
had previously listed $763.4 million on its financial
statements as a provision for taxes on the Associates sale.
   Schering-Plough Corp., a maker of pharmaceutical and
health-care products based in Madison, N.J., hinted that it
is using such a tactic to offset a gain on the $300 million
sale last month of the company's Maybelline cosmetics
division.
   Schering-Plough said the gain on the Maybelline sale
wouldn't be fully realized this year because of "various
nonrecurring offsetting charges." Although Schering wouldn't
comment on the accounting details, it said it has recently
"invested in a partnership which holds principally high-grade
short- and medium-term investments."
   At Merrill, the tax strategies are being promoted by a
group led by E.S. Purandar Das, a managing director who heads
Merrill's special advisory services. Last year, Mr. Das was
one of Merrill's best-paid investment bankers, earning more
than $2 million, according to Wall Street estimates. Mr. Das
wasn't available to comment.
   In a statement, Barry Friedberg, head of investment
banking at Merrill, said: "We do not offer tax advice and we
do not have a specific product. Our clients consult with
their legal and accounting advisers and our role is to
provide insights regarding the financial markets and execute
financing transactions."
   Wall Street executives say Citicorp and Bankers Trust New
York Corp. have promoted similar tax strategies for their
clients. Neither bank would comment.
   Other corporations believed to have pursued such
strategies include American Home Products Corp., which sold
its Boyle-Midway household products unit for $1.25 billion in
June, and Colgate-Palmolive Co., which sold its Kendall
health-care unit for $900 million in 1988. Both companies
declined to discuss the accounting for the assets sales.
   In one example of the tax strategy, three parties form a
partnership to acquire a fixed-income security that doesn't
trade publicly. The first party -- typically a company that
doesn't have to pay U.S. taxes -- puts up 90% of the cost,
the second party puts up 9% and the third party puts up 1%.
   The partnership then sells the security in an installment
sale, receiving most of the sale proceeds immediately and the
remainder in the third year in a payment contingent on the
security's market value at that time. But in the second year,
the first party drops out of the partnership.
   Because the partnership must subtract one-third of the
security's book value from the sale proceeds in each year,
the partnership will show a big gain in the first year, and
will then show losses in the second and third years. The
first party thus gets most of the gain, and the second party
-- which needs the tax shelter -- gets most of the losses
after the first party drops out. The third party is only
present to keep the partnership going after the first
departs.
   Although the structure complies technically with
accounting rules, investment bankers say, some of them
believe that the IRS could disallow the losses if the agency
decided the transactions had been arranged mainly for the
purpose of beating a tax bill. Usually, an adverse IRS ruling
means only that the company must pay back taxes plus
interest. But the IRS could impose extra penalties if it
found the transactions to be abusive.
   According to one Wall Street professional, First Boston
chose not to promote such strategies because investment
bankers at the firm weren't sure the strategy would survive
an IRS audit. Another person says J.P. Morgan made the same
decision because its investment bankers considered the
transactions' tax aspects abusive. Neither First Boston nor
J.P. Morgan would comment. One Merrill executive chalked up
those reservations to "sour grapes."
   The development of this new tax strategy follows a general
tightening of corporate tax rules, starting in 1986.
   Matthew Rosen, a tax lawyer at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher
&amp; Flom, said that some recent transactions are "similar to
what we used to see in the tax-shelter industry." On the
other hand, he cautioned, many of the transactions may
involve genuine economic risks that justify their tax
treatment.
   People on Wall Street say offering the partnership tax
strategy has been a profitable line of business for Merrill
at a time when many other investment banking revenues,
particularly for mergers and acquisitions, have faltered
throughout the securities industry.
   But Merrill executives are reluctant to acknowledge
publicly the firm's leadership role in the field, because the
publicity might intensify IRS scrutiny and invite extra
competition from other securities firms. "This is a
low-profile capability," said one Merrill executive.
   Also, Merrill's role could antagonize the firm's big
customer base of small investors, who might not like the idea
that Merrill is helping big corporations beat their taxes.
But one Merrill executive contends that its role isn't any
different than advising individuals to buy tax-exempt bonds.

   When Multnomah County, Oregon, officials two months ago
began rousting those urban outdoorsmen known as the homeless
from their encampments under bridges and along railroad
tracks, they expected the load at official shelters to swell.
It didn't. Either there weren't as many homeless as was
thought, or they couldn't face the "zero-tolerance" policy of
some of the shelters toward intoxicants. The liberal
Oregonian newspaper, under the headline "Boozers get boot,"
quotes a Salvation Army official saying of transients who
won't straighten up: "Portland may not be willing to tolerate
their lifestyle any longer."

   Manufacturers
   Closes Its Swedish,
   Swiss Operations

   NEW YORK -- Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. said it closed
offices in Zurich, Geneva and Stockholm as part of the bank's
previously announced world-wide restructuring.
   The move comes as other big U.S. banks are reducing their
presence in Europe because of the high costs of doing
business there and intense competition. In recent years
foreign banks have become more skilled at performing many of
the corporate and investment services that U.S. banks had
built their European businesses around. At the same time,
most major U.S. banks have turned more of their attention to
serving the domestic market, where competition from foreign
banks isn't as stiff.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   James Brokken, Manufacturers group vice president for
Europe, said the bank's restructuring in Europe is designed
to emphasize Manufacturers's investment banking expertise and
reduce the bank's commercial banking operations. He said that
Manufacturers already has reduced its presence in such
countries as Belgium, Luxembourg and Greece. But at the same
time the bank is expanding operations in Turkey, Portugal,
Spain and Norway.
   "We've done a good job of narrowing the focus in Europe,"
he said. "I don't believe we're perfect, and we're not
earning what I want to, but we're not a big problem for the
bank."
   Mr. Brokken said Manufacturers has been scaling down its
Swiss operations for some time and finally concluded that it
could best serve Swiss clients from outside Switzerland.
   "If you look at what we can do for our clients in
Switzerland, it's not in Switzerland. It's pan-European,
first-class risk management in currencies and interest rates
and we can deliver that in a much more professional way in
London."
   The decision to withdraw from Sweden was also based on
servicing clients from other locations as well as the return
on the bank's investment there, said Mr. Brokken. "At the end
of the day, in a world in which you have to be careful about
every penny you spend, it wasn't worth the effort." He added
that Manufacturers will maintain small representative offices
in Switzerland and Sweden.
   Manufacturers Hanover, a unit of Manufacturers Hanover
Corp., hasn't been the only U.S. bank to pull back in Europe.
In the past few years, Chase Manhattan Bank sold a Dutch bank
with $5 billion in assets to France's Credit Lyonnais, and
Bank America Corp. sold its Italian bank to West Germany's
Deutsche Bank AG. U.S. banks have also been unloading
operations in Asia.
   Some European bankers are puzzled by the U.S. banks'
retreat from abroad. They have contended that U.S. banks are
surrendering markets and relationships that took years to
establish and won't be easily built up again in the future.
Foreign bankers also argue that such sales decrease the
competitive position of U.S. banks globally.
   U.S. bankers, on the other hand, retort that profitability
is more important than maintaining costly overseas
operations.

   CBS Records'
   Chief to Reduce
   Active Duties

   NEW YORK -- Walter Yetnikoff, the outspoken chief
executive officer who steered CBS Records into world
prominence and engineered its $2 billion sale to Sony Corp.,
is preparing to pull back from his management duties at the
company.
   According to executives familiar with the plan, Mr.
Yetnikoff just signed a new agreement that calls for him to
leave the chief executive post after two years. In the
meantime, he is to gradually pull out of active management
and focus on grooming his successor, the executives said. The
most logical candidate at present for that post is Tommy
Mottola, president of CBS Records domestic operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Yetnikoff was said to be unavailable late yesterday,
and Sony officials couldn't be reached for comment. But
people close to Mr. Yetnikoff stressed that he wasn't forced
out of the company and had in part initiated the move. As
reported, Mr. Yetnikoff spent several months last year
undergoing treatment for alcoholism, and has been publicly
outspoken about his efforts to combat problems with substance
abuse. Since successfully undergoing treatment, however, Mr.
Yetnikoff is said to have been unhappy at work, and is in the
midst of a second divorce.
   Mr. Yetnikoff is also said to be distressed by the highly
unflattering portrait of him in a new book, "Hit Men" by
Frederic Dannen. Mr. Yetnikoff is one of the central
characters in the book, which focuses on the top record
labels in the industry, and their involvement with
independent promoters who have been linked to organized
crime.
   Mr. Yetnikoff was an early enthusiast for getting Sony
into Hollywood, and took part in early negotiations to buy
MGM/UA Communications Inc. When those failed, he helped
persuade Sony to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainmnent Inc.
and to hire producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber as its new
management team. Mr. Yetnikoff is said to be bitterly
disappointed that he has been unable to play a more active
role at Columbia. When Sony bought Columbia last year, it
announced plans to make Mr. Yetnikoff chairman of an umbrella
committee overseeing records and music.
   However, company insiders said that never came to pass,
largely because Mr. Guber, the chief executive of Columbia,
resisted the idea -- and Mr. Yetnikoff's involvement in
Columbia's affairs. In a recent telephone interview, Mr.
Yetnikoff acknowledged that he was not actively involved at
Columbia, but indicated that it was because he had his hands
full in the record business.
   Mr. Yetnikoff, a Brooklyn native who worked his way
through Columbia University Law School, started in the early
1960s as an attorney at CBS, rising through its ranks by
cultivating strong relationships with rising artists and
signing up acts such as the The Rolling Stones. Proud of his
reputation for outrageousness, Mr. Yetnikoff frequently threw
tantrums or screamed insults in Yiddish, and feuded with
other executives and even recording artists such as Paul
Simon, who fought a long and acrimonious legal battle with
CBS Records when he defected to Warner Records, now a unit of
Time Warner Inc.
   Mr. Yetnikoff's most bitter recent feud was with Larry
Tisch, the billonaire chairman of Loews Corp. who acquired
control of parent company CBS Inc. Mr. Yetnikoff was
frequently angry that Mr. Tisch wouldn't accede to his many
demands or let him spend money the way he wanted to, and
publicly berated Mr. Tisch on several occasions. Mr. Tisch
ultimately authorized Mr. Yetnikoff to seek a buyer for the
company, and he played a prominent role in the sale to Sony.
   Although Sony doesn't provide detailed breakdowns of its
operations, CBS Records is believed to have had sales of
about $3 billion and operating profit of about $450 million
in the year ended last March.
   Mr. Yetnikoff surprised the record industry in 1988 when
he hired Mr. Mottola to replace Al Teller as president of the
CBS domestic records group. Mr. Mottola, a manager of such
groups as Hall &amp; Oates who also had a short-lived career as a
singer, had never run a company. Although insiders say his
administrative skills still leave something to be desired, he
has strong relations with talent, a key factor for success in
the music business.
   Since Mr. Mottola has been at the helm, he has reorganized
the U.S. operations, hiring a number of strong young
executives from rivals such as Time Warner Inc.'s Warner
Records. With his new team, he has started to wean CBS from
its dependence on more established superstars such as Billy
Joel and Bruce Springsteen. Mr. Mottola has focused on
developing successful new acts popular with younger record
buyers such as Living Color, Indigo Girls and Bonham. The
company's most phenomenal success in that market has been New
Kids on the Block, considered one of the industry's hottest
new groups.

   Not since D-Day has an invasion force so awesome been
assembled. We're speaking here, of course, of the
network-anchorman invasion of the Middle East. For days
unconfirmed rumors of an anchorman buildup has fueled
confusion about American television's goals in the Persian
Gulf. Days also passed while the world waited breathlessly to
learn whether Ted Koppel would be allowed into Iraq, and to
figure out where the legions commanded by Dan Rather were
stationed. These concerns have been resolved. Now, with ABC's
Sam Donaldson and NBC's "Sunday Today" co-anchor Garrick
Utley have also been deployed to the front, as has CBS's

   The government's newly announced plan to pump more air
into the nation's automobile tires will hardly make a dent in
the U.S.'s dependence on foreign oil. But some industry
efforts are under way that could gradually replace some of
the crude from the volatile Middle East in the years ahead --
if oil prices remain at or above their current $27-a-barrel
level.
   These include developing more, and more reliable, sources
of domestic and foreign oil, enhanced use of other energy
sources such as natural gas, and developing advanced
technological processes. For example, in New Zealand, Mobil
Corp. has supplied technology to convert natural gas into
gasoline, a process that could possibly make natural gas a
head-to-head competitor with oil should oil prices continue
to rise.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday announced an energy plan to
cut the nation's foreign oil dependence by as much as 550,000
barrels a day by year-end, but experts quickly faulted the
plan as insufficient.
   The U.S. now imports more than eight million barrels of
oil a day. A record one-half of all oil used to run industry,
heat homes and fuel cars comes from foreign sources, and
experts see that figure rising to 75% by the end of the
decade. Just yesterday, statistics released by the American
Petroleum Institute showed imports rising by 8.4% in July
from a year ago.
   Oil now accounts for 43% of U.S. energy use, and experts
agree this country will never be able to do without foreign
crude supplies. But it doesn't necessarily have to. The
problem for the '90s and beyond isn't foreign oil per se,
experts say; it is the stability and reliability of those who
supply it -- in particular the handful of nations ringing the
Persian Gulf, where the richest oil reserves on Earth lie.
   Recent events prove that region unreliable, says U.S.
Energy Secretary James Watkins. "This is a tough time for us,
but perhaps out of this crisis will come a better strategy,"
he adds.
   The government is counting on its planned effort to get
car tires inflated properly for savings of about 100,000
barrels of crude oil daily. Other gains would come largely
from enhanced production at domestic wells by some major U.S.
oil companies.
   The Bush administration is resisting any notion of
mounting a major conservation effort, as officials fear
reminding voters of the Carter years, during which President
Carter actually donned a sweater when he turned down the heat
at the White House. In any event, previous efforts at
conservation have proved short-lived.
   Higher taxes on gasoline are also considered politically
impossible, and atomic energy faces widespread public
opposition. Far-fetched alternatives, ranging from electric
cars to windmills, aren't yet economically viable.
   Despite the gloomy forecasts, several efforts show some
potential for lessening U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
                                                                                                       

   Domestic Oil Production
                                                                                                       

   The U.S. is still one of the world's largest oil
producers, with an estimated 27.2 billion barrels of reserves
in the ground. But that's a far cry from 34.2 billion barrels
reached in 1975 as massive oil fields in Alaska's North Slope
were opening up. No major sources of new oil are on the
horizon, and even if one were found, it would probably take
about a decade for a new source to begin large-scale
production.
   Domestic oil production will accelerate somewhat as new,
higher prices justify the very high cost of extracting more
oil from existing wells. Generally, oil producers set a
benchmark of $25 a barrel, or around the current price, to
justify the cost of technology needed to extract the
additional oil. Oil men say that less-expensive, routine
processes leave two-thirds of each potential barrel of oil
behind.
   In the past week, Chevron Corp. ordered a $100 million
increase in domestic spending this year, which it said will
"in a very short time increase the amount of oil flowing from
existing fields."
   But this doesn't have the potential to increase U.S.
output radically. More potential lies in areas not yet
drilled or currently off-limits to oil companies. A
consortium led by Chevron is ready to pump up to 100,000
barrels a day from three new platforms built in a $2.5
billion oil-drilling project off Santa Barbara, Calif. But
the group can't operate because necessary pipeline and tanker
permits have been denied on environmental grounds by local
and state authorities. The Bush administration said earlier
this week it will try to mediate this dispute.
   Major new oil reserves also may lie hidden under the
tundra in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. To the
dismay of some both inside and outside the oil industry,
however, exploration there was blocked in the aftermath of
the Exxon Valdez oil spill. "We're willing to risk lives in
the Persian Gulf, but not the lives of caribou in Alaska,"
complains Henry Schuler, an energy security specialist with
the Center for Strategic International Studies in Washington,
D.C.
                                                                                                       

   More Foreign Oil
                                                                                                       

   No one is seriously suggesting all foreign oil could be
avoided; the country has been importing vast amounts for
decades and will almost certainly import more from here on,
regardless of domestic gains. But now many oil executives are
evaluating non-traditional foreign suppliers, and a leading
candidate is the Soviet Union.
   It is already the largest oil producer in the world,
pumping about 12 million barrels a day, far more than the
present output of Saudi Arabia. But its exports, which have
generally gone to Eastern Europe, are dwindling; Soviet oil
men have encountered production problems that have cut total
output in each of the past two years. Now, the Soviet Union
is seeking help to redevelop its industry. That, together
with its markedly changed international political role, is
cheering some international oil companies.
   Not long ago, some Soviet oil men visited Houston to
solicit U.S. oil-service companies' help in developing their
fields. Others recently were at Texaco headquarters in White
Plains, N.Y., where an exploration pact was struck four days
ago. Elf-Aquitaine, the big French company with strong U.S.
ties, has agreed to explore one potential Soviet field, and
Chevron is talking with Soviets about another.
   But hopeful U.S. oil men had better "be long on patience
and on time," says Marshall Goldman, a Soviet expert with
Harvard University. Although the huge country is rich in
energy resources -- it has, for instance, 45% of the world's
natural gas reserves -- it lacks the procedural arrangements
necessary to produce and market them efficiently. The system
for extracting resources sometimes lapses into near anarchy.
Despite directives from Moscow, coal miners in the Ukraine in
recent weeks sold some of the coal they were mining directly
to Japanese traders in exchange for Nissan cars they coveted.
   In addition, limited amounts of petroleum may be obtained
in the future from obscure oil-producing countries previously
ignored as too small to matter. Vietnam now is producing
50,000 barrels a day of Bach Ho Crude with the help of
foreign investors and is aiming for 200,000 barrels daily in
two years. Oil industry people also mention Moroccan and
Brazilian oil.
                                                                                                       

   Natural Gas
                                                                                                       

   On paper, at least, no resource offers better hope of
reducing oil use than natural gas. Gas also burns cleaner,
giving it environmental advantages, and it's a more easily
tapped resource than oil.
   Technically, it is easy for utilities and manufacturing
businesses to change the fuel they burn from oil to gas. Many
of these facilities are already capable of fuel-switching and
exercise that ability when gas prices are more attractive
than oil. Natural gas can even be used in cars, after certain
engine modifications and the addition of a compressed-gas
storage tank.
   A big problem, however, is that natural gas is much more
difficult to transport and store than oil. In response to the
current oil crisis, the government is working on ways to
simplify transportation at least, in hopes of encouraging
enough additional substitution to replace 160,000 barrels of
oil a day.
   If oil prices rise far enough, however, the technology
developed by Mobil to turn natural gas directly into gasoline
could become a significant option. The catalyst, found by the
company's researchers 10 years ago, "is magical stuff," a
Mobil official says.
   The alchemy becomes cheaper than standard refining
processes for gasoline after oil hits $36 a barrel, some
industry officials believe. So for now, only one plant in the
world is fitted out to do this. Built in New Zealand in 1985,
it puts out 15,000 barrels a day of gasoline, supplying
one-third of that nation's needs.
   If oil prices go up substantially, "who knows" what the
possibilities are, the Mobil official says.
   Some 4,000 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves lie under
the earth in the U.S., Canada and many other countries,
making gas reserves more plentiful than oil reserves. The
Soviet Union alone has as much untapped natural gas as Saudi
Arabia has in equivalent oil reserves, one expert says. In
the U.S., gas reserves are 165 trillion cubic feet.
   In the past, oil companies searched for oil, and were
dismayed if they found only gas. But that's changing.
Already, Amoco Corp. is more of a gas producer than an oil
producer.
                                                                                                       

   Conservation
                                                                                                       

   Conservation has flagged since oil prices crashed in the
mid-1980s, but built-in efficiencies such as more home
insulation and fuel-efficient cars remain.
   More gains can be realized. While experts are reluctant to
make exact predictions, they say that historically, a 10%
rise in fuel prices causes a 2% decrease in consumption. Oil
prices have risen more than 27% since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   "We have the potential to save a lot of energy overnight
by simply altering behavioral responses; we estimate that as
much as 30% of the energy decline following the last crisis
was attributable to people changing their habits," says
Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates.
   For instance, motorists are driving an average of 1,000
miles a year more now than in 1980. And they're doing it in
cars that in the past two years have gotten 7% heavier, 10%
more powerful and half a mile per gallon less fuel-efficient.
This alone is using an added 200,000 barrels of oil a day.
   Another form of conservation is cogeneration, or the
process in which some industrial plants can generate
electricity at the same time they are burning a fuel such as
coal, gas or oil. The plants then generally sell this
electricity to utility companies.
   Less than 5% of electricity is produced through
cogeneration, but its use is growing. Theoretically,
cogeneration should conserve energy because it makes a
twofold use of one energy source. But in practice that
doesn't necessarily happen. Cogeneration can consume more oil
and gas, contends Michael Gluckman, technical director of
Electric Power Research Institute, because many cogeneration
plants run on those fuels, and the power they produce often
replaces power from utility plants that burn coal.
                                                                                                       

   Coal
                                                                                                       

   Coal supplies in the U.S. are huge. Using technology
available today, 268 billion tons are recoverable. That's
enough at current consumption rates to last almost three
centuries.
   Unfortunately, opportunities to replace oil with coal over
the near-term aren't plentiful. For one thing, tightening
environmental restrictions are making it more difficult to
use coal, a dirtier-burning fuel than either oil or gas. And
following the energy crises of the '70s, many utilities and
manufacturing plants have already converted to coal.
   Today, 57% of the nation's electricity needs are supplied
by coal. Oil ranks behind nuclear, natural gas and hydro
power, controlling less than 5% of the utility market.
   Unless crude-oil prices stay above $25 a barrel for a
protracted period or severe supply disruptions occur, there
probably will be little incentive for facilities still using
oil to switch to coal. "It would take a year of high oil
prices," says Daniel Gerkin, a senior vice president of the
National Coal Association.
   Although oil is the fuel of choice in the transportation
sector, there has been some experimentation with coal. A coal
and oil slurry has potential as a fuel for barges and
railroads. And in South Africa, where oil for political
reasons has been embargoed for years, gasoline is made from
coal. But Mr. Gerkin points out that the government there
subsidizes that production. Gasoline from coal wouldn't be
economic in the U.S. unless oil prices increased to well over
$35 a barrel.
                                                                                                       

   Unconventional Fuels

   Crude oil made from tar sands is one of the most promising
alternative fuels. Oil-laden earth is currently being turned
into 60,000 barrels of high-quality synthetic crude a day in
the northern reaches of Alberta, Canada, by Suncor Inc., a
unit of Sun Co. of Philadelphia. Five miles down the road,
Syncrude Canada Ltd., partly owned by Imperial Oil, an
Exxon-controlled Canadian company, has production three times
that of Suncor.
   The sands are essentially mined, with a giant bucket-wheel
ripping tons of the tarry earth from mountainsides. The earth
is then processed into crude that in turn is refined into
motor fuel or heating oil.
   Suncor officials admit that it takes oil prices of at
least $25 a barrel to make their process commercially viable.
But an estimated 300 billion barrels of recoverable oil lies
under the giant Athabasca tar sands. So Suncor, which has
manufactured its synthetic oil there since 1967, believes it
will realize "an adequate return" over the long term.
   Venezuela creates a slightly different product, a
super-heavy crude, from its Orinoco Belt. The material is so
dense that without the addition of water, it's almost
impossible to transport. But currently 15,000 barrels a day
of this gunk is being turned into a slurry and exported. OPEC
doesn't even count it against Venezuela's oil-output quota,
though by 1995 Venezuela could be producing by some estimates
400,000 barrels a day of this oil. Germany and the U.K.
import some of the viscous product, and a utility in downtown
London burns it without further processing.
   Synthetic fuels still must live down past failures.
Creation of an entire $88 billion synthetic fuels industry,
as tried by the Carter administration, should never have been
attempted, says John Sawhill, the former deputy energy
secretary who headed up the project. "Synfuels Corp. was just
too big. We were required to spend too much money too
quickly," he says.
   Of 150 proposals examined, only a handful ever got
started. The largest of those were coal gasification and
oil-shale extraction projects. None would be commercially
feasible if constructed today. Some of the oil-shale plants
were particularly troublesome; at one built by Unocal Corp.
in Parachute Creek, Colo., systems became so gummed with
shale waste that jackhammers were needed to clean them out.
Moreover, by today's environmental standards, shale plants
would be highly undesirable.
   The first project funded by Synfuels, a coal gasification
plant in Southern California that turns coal into gas, seems
to have been one of the more beneficial. Until its recent
closure, it was providing enough power to a nearby electric
grid to light 100,000 homes in Los Angeles. Texaco recently
purchased it and will put it back into operation by 1992. But
then it will be used to burn coal and sewage sludge from Los
Angeles.

   INTERSTATE 271, Ohio -- Just a decade ago, an oil shock
and looming recession could have knocked Ohio on its back.
   But this is a different Ohio. Here in the industrial
heartland, industry has a new look.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Smokestacks are nowhere to be found. Instead, the scene
along this manufacturing artery east of Cleveland is one of
endless suburban sprawl: smokeless industrial parks, as
ubiquitous as the McDonald's arches that surround them.
   And while there is obviously concern about the crisis in
the Persian Gulf, there has been little disruption of the
industry that goes on here behind neatly manicured lawns.
"Ohio is a lot more resilient than it once was," says Ronald
M. Rebner, chief financial officer of Keithley Instruments
Inc. Barring war in the Middle East, he says, his company and
others "will just absorb the higher oil costs and keep
marching forward."
   Randall W. Eberts, an economist at the Cleveland Federal
Reserve Bank, says that's not just bluster. "Manufacturing
has come roaring back," he says, and because of sharply
higher productivity, the new manufacturing jobs "may prove
more secure in the next recession than the ones they
replaced."
   Ohio's new industrial landscape is a good example of a
growing kind of American industry that relies more on
efficiency, creativity and pluck than oil and a surging U.S.
economy. And Keithley Instruments, just off I-271 in nearby
Solon, is a good place to start a driving tour of that
landscape.
   The company, which makes equipment used in laboratories to
measure electric current, has raised its manufacturing
productivity 50% in the past three years by attacking the way
it designs products.
   Design and production engineers, who once ignored each
other, now work together in teams, simultaneously designing a
product and the process to make it. One result: The 36
fasteners that assembly-line workers once had to screw in or
bolt to one product have been slashed to two.
   Mr. Rebner motions to the window in his ground-floor
office and the pretty lawn beyond. "How we've been able to
shift from all those people who used to work in the steel
mills to this I don't know," he says. "But there's no way
this is the Rust Belt."
   Keithley is one of hundreds of companies that have sprung
up along I-271 and the highways crisscrossing it around
Cleveland. Like their industrial forefathers, these newcomers
still manufacture goods. But it's manufacturing that bears
little resemblance to the gritty smokestack version of
yesteryear.
   The scale is smaller. Energy consumption is largely
limited to the electricity used to heat and light buildings.
Exports play a big role. The products themselves have a
higher technology content and fill a niche rather than garden
variety metal bending or nuts and bolts. And many of these
new manufacturers are highly prosperous.
   While parts of the nation teeter near recession, Ohio's
economy chugs along. The state is the only one in the
industrial Midwest that still expects 2% or better job growth
this year. The revival of manufacturing is a major reason
why.
   Plenty of problems must still be overcome before Ohio
becomes a manufacturing paradise. The state ranks 39th in the
nation in the availability of private venture capital, Mr.
Eberts says. Worker wages stand 15% above the national
average (though less than the 20% premium paid in 1983). And
while workers are skilled and plentiful, they're not terribly
well educated: Only 17% of household heads have college
degrees, putting Ohio near the bottom in attained higher
education.
   But already, there are other statistics that tell a
remarkable story. Between 1979 and 1982, Ohio lost 27% of its
manufacturing employment. In all, 372,000 jobs vanished as
factories padlocked their gates and companies pulled up
stakes for sunnier climes. In January 1983, when Ohio's
jobless rate peaked at 14.2%, the state looked like a goner.
   Today, joblessness stands at 5.1%, less than in California
and below the national average. Of course, services have
accounted for most of the job growth: In 1989, in fact,
services for the first time surpassed manufacturing as Ohio's
leading job sector. Still, manufacturing has posted a net
gain of about 100,000 jobs since January 1983.
   By contrast, manufacturing employment has continued to
slide in New York and Pennsylvania, which together have lost
an additional 239,000 such jobs since 1982. Ohio now accounts
for more manufactured goods than any other state except
California and New York, having passed Pennsylvania in the
past decade.
   Economists and executives offer several explanations for
Ohio's resurgent manufacturing. Some cite declines in worker
wages and higher productivity gains than in neighboring
states. Others attribute it to a favorable political
environment that has helped attract and nurture new
businesses.
   In truth, Ohio's strength may stem from more subtle
factors: Its diverse manufacturing base, covering a wide
range of soft and hard goods, as well as its critical mass in
some emerging sectors, such as surgical and medical
equipment.
   Whatever the reason, technology-based companies say it's
now easier to do business in Ohio. "Five years ago, I had to
go to Silicon Valley to get the technology I needed. Now,
everything is available locally," says entrepreneur Albert P.
Kretz Jr. His firm, Synthetic Blood &amp; Medical Technologies
Inc. of Highland Heights, another town along I-271, expects
this fall to begin producing a tiny, automated
insulin-injecting pump for diabetics.
   Labor, too, is readily available. In some cases, older
executives who weren't wanted at big corporations anymore
have been welcomed at small companies just starting out.
   That was the case at a firm founded by Howard J.
Drechsler, a pharmacist who had experimented for years with
light sources to treat skin disease. Finally, in 1981, he
told his wife he wanted to stop filling prescriptions and
start selling his own products. "She thought I was nuts,"
says Mr. Drechsler, now 58.
   Nine years later, the entrepreneur and two cousins have
parlayed their $6,000 investment -- and $101,000 in seed
money from Ohio -- into National Biological Corp., a $3
million-a-year business that has sold its products to
customers as far away as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
   Though shipments to the Middle East have been temporarily
suspended, Mr. Drechsler says that's a minor concern. And the
6% increase he expects in transportation costs stemming from
the Iraqi invasion pales in comparison with a 32% surge in
health-insurance costs for the company's 26 employees, he
says. "That's the real crisis," he quips.
   The company, in Twinsburg on an offshoot of I-271, makes
ultraviolet lamps used mainly to treat psoriasis. It is the
last in a long row of new businesses on Enterprise Parkway.
   The company struggled at first. Then, in 1983, it got a
big break when Mr. Drechsler hired Elton T. Leppelmeier, one
of the nation's leading ultraviolet-light experts. "He wrote
the book on this kind of therapy," Mr. Drechsler says. "For a
small company like us, just starting out, to get a guy of his
stature was a huge boost."
   Mr. Leppelmeier says he got the "silver bullet" from
General Electric Co., where he had worked for nearly 40 years
as a senior engineer in GE's Cleveland-based lighting
division. Now nearly 65 and chief of product development for
National Biological, Mr. Leppelmeier says he has no plans to
retire. "Why should I? Just because GE had no use for me
doesn't mean I can't make a contribution somewhere else," he
says.
   Getting the most out of people is the top priority at
Automated Packaging Systems Inc., just around the corner from
National Biological in Twinsburg. Founded in 1962 by brothers
Hershey and Bernard Lerner, the company was chased by zoning
inspectors from its first production site -- the family
garage -- in the Queens borough of New York City. Then it was
on to Brooklyn. About a decade later, the company settled in
Twinsburg, the first tenant in an industrial park that now
stretches for miles.
   Today, Automated Packaging Systems is a global player in
the world packaging business. It makes machines that print
labels and package everything from soft-drink containers to
plastic bags. Annual sales total about $80 million. But,
despite its size, Automated still manages to retain a
personal touch with its 650 employees.
   The atmosphere is relaxed, the banter frequent. When
Chairman Hershey strolls through the factory floor, employees
call out, "Hey, Hersh, how ya' doin'?" The company phone book
alphabetizes people by their first names. The brothers
regularly attend funerals and weddings. And the perks of
employment at Automated include free use for all employees of
the company cottage at a lakeside resort in central Ohio.
   More than half of the employees are involved in voluntary
quality circles meant to improve productivity and product
quality. Recently, one seven-person team tackled a problem
that had vexed Automated for years: the time lost setting up
machinery for a new production run. The process typically
took more than an hour. After filming and studying it for
several months, the team whittled the time to 15 minutes.
   Hershey says he felt like a proud father when the group
presented its findings to management. "They did a terrific
job," he says, beaming. The team has begun to teach other
workers the new system.
   There is no union at Automated. "If you feel treated
unjustly, you can walk right into Hershey's office and he'll
listen to your complaint," says Brian Ripley, who packs
freight on the shipping dock and has five relatives working
at Automated. "When you have direct access to the chairman,
who needs a union?"
   Automated tries mightily to promote loyalty, eschewing
layoffs and almost always promoting from within. And loyalty
is returned: The company's first hire in Brooklyn, Vinnie
Lattur, still works on the shop floor.
   Automated has also cultivated loyalty with its suppliers.
It has bought plastic resin -- an essential ingredient of the
labels it makes -- from the same suppliers since its
beginnings even when others were offering cheaper
alternatives. That's a policy that will guarantee Automated
supplies, Hershey Lerner says, even if hostilities in the
Middle East trigger shortages of oil and, ultimately,
oil-derived resin.
   Just around the corner from Keithley Instruments in Solon
is another sleek manufacturing compound. The company, Tecmar,
sits on Solon's main thoroughfare, Cochran Road, an
industrial artery lined for miles on either side with new
buildings and businesses.
   Hank Oberle, the tanned and blond operations vice
president, looks as if he had been transplanted from
California. He's dressed in a white shirt, open at the
collar, and khaki slacks. But his approach to manufacturing
is hardly laid back. Since he took charge of production five
years ago, Tecmar, which makes equipment that stores computer
data on tape as a backup to the hard disk, has slashed its
manufacturing employment from 380 to 103.
   "We automate everything we can," says Mr. Oberle, who left
Eaton Corp., a diversified truck-parts maker in Cleveland,
because of what he felt was the insufficient priority given
manufacturing.
   Like many of the companies along I-271, Tecmar suggests
how ever-declining technology costs have put some of the best
manufacturing methods and equipment within the reach of small
players. State-of-the-art circuit boards get minted at a rate
of one every two minutes, output approaching the best world
standards.
   Even with the hostilities in the Middle East, the company
expects at least 20% growth next year. "We're planning to
expand aggressively," says Mark A. Bretl, Tecmar's
31-year-old president.
   Of course, small-scale manufacturing can be a
disadvantage. Small production runs mean higher per-unit
costs. But some companies sprouting up along I-271 have
figured out ways to combat that, too.
   A final stop at Iotech Inc., west of Solon in Bedford
Heights, is a case in point. Founded three years ago by
entrepreneur Thomas DeSantis, the company, which makes
devices that link computers to scientific instruments, has
averaged about 80% growth each year. But even with sales this
year of nearly $10 million, it's still a relative midget in
manufacturing. While Keithley or Tecmar stamp out thousands
of the same circuit boards, 500 is considered a long
production run at Iotech.
   So Iotech farms out part of its production, bringing new
meaning to the phrase cottage industry. It employs about a
dozen part-time workers who put together its circuit boards.
The workers pick up their kits, stocked with all the
necessary gadgetry, assemble 25 or so at their own pace and
bring them back for a refill.
   "I like it a lot," says Joyce Mays, inspecting the parts
in her refill kit. The mother of three, who once worked on an
electronics assembly line, figures she nets about $4 an hour.
More important, she says, "I can set my own hours." In her
case, the production line -- her kitchen -- usually doesn't
get cranked up until the children have gone to bed.
   Mr. DeSantis says the quality of the farmed-out circuit
boards is top-notch. And Iotech reaps big benefits. The main
one is that it saves capital, allowing it to spend more on
development and marketing.
   There's no recession in Iotech's future, Mr. DeSantis
insists. Already, he says, August is shaping up as the
company's best month ever, with the little firm shipping its
products to customers world-wide. About one-third of Iotech's
products go overseas, mostly to Western Europe.
   "We're small, so we have to be smarter, more creative. We
have to spend our money more wisely," he says. "That's the
only way we can hope to compete."

   Abreast of the Market:
   Industrials Plunge 66.83 on News
   Of U.S. Inflation, Mideast Crisis

   NEW YORK -- Stock prices buckled under the pressure
created by signals of increasing tensions in the Middle East
and evidence that U.S. inflation may have been on the rise
even before the recent surge in oil prices.
   Growth stocks and recession-resistant consumer issues
paced the market's downturn, while oil and precious-metals
stocks bucked the decline -- a pattern which has prevailed
since Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait two weeks ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had risen less
than one point in the two previous sessions, posted its
lowest close since the Mideast crisis began by plummeting
66.83 to 2681.44.
   Among broader measures, Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index
tumbled 7.67 to 332.39, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index skidded 3.81 to 182.73 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index fell 7.14 to 308.16.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by 1,300 to 330 on the
Big Board. Trading activity remained fairly light, with
138,850,000 shares changing hands, compared with 135,210,000
Wednesday.
   The market initially headed lower amid disappointment with
the consumer price report for July, which showed that the
so-called core inflation rate -- prices excluding the food
and energy sectors -- rose 0.6% last month. The overall
consumer price index, helped by a 0.7% decline in energy
prices, rose 0.4%.
   "The numbers should have been better than they were, and
investors received a message that inflation is running at too
high of a level," said A.C. Moore, director of research at
Argus Research Corp.
   Prices continued to fall as the session progressed amid
two major developments which dashed hopes for any quick
resolution of the Middle East conflict:
   -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in a televised address
delivered by a spokesman, referred to a Jihad, or holy war,
against the U.S. and threatened that Americans would die in
the Middle East.
   -- King Hussein of Jordan, who met with President Bush to
discuss the crisis, denied afterward that he had carried a
message from Iraq. Several reports said the king had been
given a peace proposal by Saddam Hussein to be taken to
President Bush.
   The market plummeted to session lows in the final hour of
trading, setting off one of the exchange's "circuit breakers"
designed to put the brakes on market declines.
   At 3:41 p.m. EDT, with the Dow Jones industrials down 50
points, the Big Board's "uptick" rule for program trades tied
to stock-index arbitrage went into effect -- prohibiting
arbitrage-related stock sales until after the issues moved
higher.
   But the "circuit breaker" didn't stop the market from
ending the day at session lows, and selling in index futures
following the close of stock trading laid the groundwork for
possible arbitrage selling at today's opening.
   September contracts on the S&amp;P 500 ended the session at a
discount of about 1/2 point to the cash index -- well below
the level at which traders could lock in profits by
purchasing the futures and selling baskets of stocks.
   And with the Middle East situation still in flux, "Traders
with positions aren't going to want to hold anything over the
weekend while they're waiting for any kind of news," said W.
Daniel Williams III, a vice president of trading at Dillon,
Read &amp; Co.
   Blue-chip consumer stocks hit hard in the latest session
included Philip Morris, which went down 2 to 45 1/4 in
composite trading of 1.5 million shares; McDonald's, down 1
1/8 to 29; Procter &amp; Gamble, down 2 7/8 to 80 5/8; Coca-Cola,
down 1 1/2 to 43 1/8; Merck, down 4 1/8 to 83 3/4, and Eli
Lilly, down 4 1/8 to 71 1/2.
   Within the growth-stock category, Boeing fell 1 3/4 to 50
5/8 on 1.5 million shares, General Electric lost 1 3/8 to 64
7/8, Limited Inc. dropped 1 3/8 to 17 3/4 and Waste
Management fell 1 3/4 to 37 7/8.
   Oil stocks, bolstered by the surge in oil prices, closed
little changed. Exxon lost 1/4 to 51 3/4, Texaco fell 1/8 to
62 1/4, Chevron slid 1/8 to 77 1/2, Mobil rose 1/4 to 66 3/4,
Amoco slid 1/4 to 56 1/2, Unocal added 1/8 to 32 3/4 and
Royal Dutch Petroleum gained 1/2 to 83 3/8.
   Gold stocks showed strength across the board. Homestake
Mining rose 1 1/2 to 23 1/8, Placer Dome rose 1 to 19 1/2,
Battle Mountain Gold gained 3/8 to 12 3/4, Hecla Mining went
up 3/8 to 13 and ASA Ltd. advanced 2 5/8 to 56 1/4.
   Ohio Edison, the most active Big Board issue, plunged 2
1/2 to 17 3/8 on 2.2 million shares. Ohio regulators decided
to grant the company a one-time rate increase of $142.3
million, rather than the three-step, $216 million rate boost
it had requested -- a decline that led analysts to believe
its common-stock dividend may be cut.
   The utility said the decision would have "a materially
adverse effect" on its results and its board could be
expected to consider the payout at a meeting scheduled for
Tuesday. Edward J. Tirello, an analyst at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham, suggested the board could reduce the annual
payout to $1.50 a share from $1.96, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.
   Hewlett-Packard, which reported that net income for its
third quarter ended July 31 was down 5% from a year ago,
dropped 1 7/8 to 35 7/8 on 1.3 million shares. Analysts
generally had expected that the company would post higher
earnings for the quarter.
   Navistar International, second on the most actives list,
dipped 3/8 to 2 7/8 as 2.2 million shares changed hands. The
company posted net income of $6 million for the third quarter
ended July 31, compared with $28 million a year earlier.
   Security Pacific skidded 3 to 28 3/4. Analysts at several
brokerage houses lowered earnings estimates on the company
following a disclosure that it expects second-half results to
fall short of the year-earlier level, citing weakness in the
U.S. economy and the likelihood of slow growth in
non-interest income, according to the Dow Jones investor
report.
   Issues of other West Coast-based bank holding companies
also fell sharply. Wells Fargo tumbled 3 1/8 to 59 5/8, while
First Interstate Bancorp fell 1 3/8 to 31 1/4.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 3.81
to 336.83. Volume totaled 14,160,000 issues.

   NEW YORK -- Investors pummeled stocks and bonds, alarmed
by rising Mideast tensions and more signs that the U.S.
economy is sinking into a recession combined with high
inflation.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 66.83 points to
close at 2681.44 on light volume. The decline was the
sharpest since Aug. 6, when the Dow lost 93.31 points.
Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell 1 5/8 points, or
$16.25 for each $1,000 of face amount, in hectic trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   New economic reports showing rising consumer prices and
sinking housing starts pushed the dollar down to a new
postWorld War II low against the German mark. That bad news
was compounded by remarks from Iraq renewing its call for a
holy war against the U.S and dashing hopes for a quick
diplomatic solution to the Mideast standoff.
   The bloodletting in the stock market was broad; none of
the 30 stocks in the Dow industrial average gained.
   Christopher Pedersen, director of trading at Twenty-First
Securities, said a 25-point drop in the Dow in the final half
hour of trading reflected broad selling by institutional
investors. "A lot of it was by pension funds -- just a
general bailing out of this market," he said. Coming into
yesterday, "a lot of people were expecting some kind of
bounce," he said.
   Even before stocks opened for trading, the bond market was
hit by news that the July consumer price index rose 0.4% --
more sharply than expected -- even with a decline in energy
prices. Then came the report that July housing starts fell
sharply, when they were expected to be flat with the June
level. Finally, the news wires were sizzling with indications
that the Mideast tinderbox once again was edging toward the
kindling point.
   The CPI report, combined with the decline in housing
starts, raises the specter of stagflation, that deadly
combination of rising prices and a shrinking economy, said
Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
   "The reaction in the financial community was
understandably terrible," Mr. Straszheim said. "People are
getting a whiff of stagflation and see the Federal Reserve in
an even tighter box." The Fed has declared itself first and
foremost an inflation fighter, but at the same it is coming
under enormous pressure to ease interest rates in order to
stimulate an economy slipping into recession.
   In Mr. Straszheim's view, inflation is now practically out
of the Fed's control. "It will take a good garden-variety
recession or worse to get inflation down," he said -- one in
which consumer demand weakens so much that higher prices
simply don't hold.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell on volume of 138.9 million shares in New
York Stock Exchange trading. Declining issues swamped
advancers, 1,300 to 330.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.92%.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5525 German marks and 147.25 Japanese yen,
compared with 1.5660 marks and 147.65 yen Wednesday.

   Test your post-Cold War IQ:
   Which Member of Congress has fretted the most about George
Bush's Mideast intervention -- anti-Contra crusader Chris
Dodd of Connecticut, flaky New York liberal Ted Weiss or
sober Georgia hawk Sam Nunn?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If you said Sen. Nunn, you're ahead of the curve in the
fast-evolving politics of foreign policy. While liberals have
praised Mr. Bush, Mr. Nunn has typified conservatives who've
worried, grumbled and caviled. In one amazing TV exchange,
this paper's ardently centrist Washington bureau chief,
Albert Hunt, had to hold the hawkish line against
conservatives Robert Novak and Pat Buchanan. "Neville Novak,"
he said, is "General Patton when it comes to Grenada, a place
that doesn't count," but Neville Chamberlain "when it comes
to our national interest."
   Mr. Novak is an Arabist, which may account for his unusual
lapse. But the explanation for the angst of other
conservatives is more disturbing: The return of the right's
traditional isolationism. This inward-looking nationalism,
with roots back to George Washington's farewell address, has
lain dormant since the 1950s. But with the demise of
communism as an enemy, it's been waking up. The Iraqi crisis
has brought its sentiments out of the closet.
   Few of these erstwhile hawks are yet opposing the Bush
action, but their support has been grudging or hedged -- not
unlike Michael Dukakis's reaction to the U.S. strike against
Libya. They're even resorting to anti-intervention arguments
long used by the left.
   Some now suggest that we defend only democracies. Pat
Buchanan, who once derided liberals for heading "for the tall
grass" on Central America, worries that Americans may die to
put "the emir of Kuwait back on the throne." But he didn't
seem to mind defending Vietnamese or Koreans who were
governed by generals. And he neglects the fate of a very
helpful democracy to the west of Iraq, Israel.
   Others invoke that familiar red herring, the U.S. "global
policeman." The worrywarts at the Washington Times complain
that Mr. Bush "promises to commit us to military
confrontations and an endless series of diplomatic crises in
the future." He does? In fact, Mr. Bush has already managed
to keep America well clear of post-Cold War conflicts in
Liberia and Kashmir. A policy of intervention doesn't forego
prudential judgments about national interests, or the limits
of U.S. power. Regarding Iraq, Mr. Bush may go too far in
saying the American "way of life" is at stake, but the U.S.
interest in post-Cold War stability surely is.
   Still other conservatives are born-again multilateralists.
"Our efforts ought to be aimed at our allies," says Oklahoma
GOP Rep. Mickey Edwards. "Since when did it become our role
to be the sole defender of the Saudi Arabian oil fields?"
This lack-of-international-support line is one liberals used
against Mr. Edwards's efforts to aid the Contras. While it's
great to have the allies onboard, does anybody believe they'd
act if the U.S. didn't lead? Because the allies are
hesitating over a blockade -- sorry, "interdiction" -- should
Mr. Bush now drop the idea?
   Mr. Edwards could fairly say the Gulf (far away) is not
Central America (our backyard). But that merely illustrates
another trait of right-wing isolationism: Its disengagement
from the world is selective. Burton Yale Pines of the
Heritage Foundation supports Mr. Bush, but also says the U.S.
should now intervene unilaterally only in Asia and the
Americas. Why Asia? "Because we're the only ones who can do
it," he says. But that's largely true of the Gulf, too.
   By arbitrarily limiting the U.S. sphere of action,
conservatives invite regional powers to maraud outside it.
Mr. Pines compares America's post-Cold War role to "the chief
of a volunteer fire department. We'll ring the alarm and
drive the truck," he says. But the corollary is that if no
one else jumps on the truck, we'll let the fire burn. And in
a world of proliferating nuclear weapons and ballistic
missiles, some fires can quickly spread.
   The doubting hawks do have two legitimate worries. The
first is that the liberal establishment will once again lose
its nerve, as it did in Vietnam. Liberals approved the Tonkin
Gulf resolution, after all. Mr. Bush could yet lose his
nerve, too, settling for a stalemate that solves nothing but
costs much. These are understandable fears, but they are not
a case for doing nothing; they're a case for doing what has
to be done to win.
   Right-wing isolationism is a small movement for now, but
watch it grow at the first sign of trouble in Iraq.
California Republican Rep. Robert Dornan says he strongly
supports Mr. Bush's action, but warns that, "It will be only
a matter of time before Republicans ask why American boys are
fighting to defend one monarchy and to restore another."
   Beyond oil or chemical weapons, Mr. Bush's efforts are
critical as a test of U.S. ability to deter and contain
post-Cold War rogues who threaten our interests. Failure
might unite right and left isolationism in blocking such
efforts in the future. This is the same coalition that left
us unprepared for World War II.
   Conservative Republicans ought to be especially wary. The
Democratic Party's strain of liberal isolationism is one
reason voters haven't trusted the likes of Mr. Dukakis to be
commander-in-chief. But the same fate befell Republicans not
so long ago. Sen. Robert Taft, the conservative hero of the
1940s and 1950s, voted against NATO, as did most
conservatives until Barry Goldwater. Pat Buchanan may revere
Taft, but running for president he couldn't even win the
Republican nomination.

   LONDON -- Shares in Reuters Holdings PLC were hit by
reports of snags in the upgraded version of the company's
Dealing 2000 system, a communications network for
foreign-exchange markets.
   On London's Stock Exchange, Reuters stock fell 7.9%, while
American depositary receipts plunged 11% to $51.375 in
national over-the-counter trading in New York. The sell-off
was prompted by a negative research report by Wertheim
Schroder, a New York investment firm. The firm reportedly
took Reuters off its list of recommended stocks, citing
problems with Dealing 2000-2.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wertheim refused to provide copies of its report or to
discuss its message.
   Also, Trading Systems Technology, an industry newsletter,
said in a recent edition that Reuters was having testing
problems with the new system.
   The system, which represents a major investment and a
potentially significant source of profits, will allow
foreign-exchange dealers to communicate with as many as four
parties via computer terminals. Dealers could also enter bids
and offers, which the system would match up.
   In London, the company dismissed reports that the Dealing
2000-2 project is having problems, though it said that
"further testing is required on peripheral systems and
overall system integration."

   Assets of 252 general purpose funds rose $469.9 million to
$140.04 billion and assets of 104 broker-dealer funds rose
$1.09 billion to $163.32 billion. Assets of 169 institutional
funds rose $829.3 million to $101.11 billion.

   Assets of money-market funds rose for the seventh

instruments. "Despite a slight easing of yields offered by
money-market funds, events in the Persian Gulf have enhanced
their attraction as safe and liquid investment vehicles,"
said Dr. Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist at

   HONG KONG -- While pro-democracy demonstrators occupied
Tiananmen Square in May last year, Dening Wang was facing a
pile of work at his office in the nearby Beijing Hotel. The
director of John Colling Associates (China) Ltd. was rushing
to translate a feasibility study on a port project.

the square on June 4 of last year, Mr. Wang biked to his
office that morning, undeterred by sporadic shooting outside
the hotel.

   He and the project survived. And after several months
delay, its two foreign participants, Royal Dutch/Shell Group
and Nedlloyd Group, returned to China earlier this year to
resume negotiations. "We took stock of the situation, and
decided that the economic fundamentals are still strong,"
says Tim Brennand, managing director of Shell China Ltd.
   But for each investment plan in China that has gone
forward, several have been axed. The Tiananmen killings
precipitated a dive in direct foreign investment, and the
flow of funds that resumed after the initial period of shock
was far thinner and aimed at fewer projects. China's dire
economic state has contributed to the steady slide, as has
the emergence of the newly democratized Eastern European
countries, which threaten to supplant China as the world's
biggest frontier market.
   "The number of opportunities and the amount of investment
will shrink. There was an energy boom, a hotel boom. But
there won't be another boom," says John Hoffmann, another
director at John Colling, a Hong Kong-based consultant firm.
"But there'll always be opportunities for those with a
serious interest in China."
   The size of the market will continue to draw multinational
companies like Shell, which take a long-term view toward
China. Even so, many companies are adjusting their plans.
Some are reducing the size of their investment, while others
are demanding additional benefits. Still others are shifting
focus to match Beijing's emphasis on such sectors as basic
industries and transportation. In addition, foreign investors
generally are resigning themselves to longer repayment
periods.
   New foreign direct investment, which began to slow in the
third quarter, dropped to a trickle in the first quarter of
this year. According to official Chinese figures, the value
of newly approved contracts fell 42% to $870 million in the
first quarter from the year-earlier period. This follows a
43% drop in the October-December period to $1.13 billion.
   (Actual foreign direct investment has been largely flat
since June 4, 1989, indicating that foreign businessmen have
continued to honor earlier commitments.)
   The drop in new foreign direct investment could have been
more acute had it not been for money from Taiwan. Following
in the footsteps of their Hong Kong counterparts, many Taiwan
exporters are moving their manufacturing bases to China.
Chinese officials estimate that cumulative investment from
Taiwan, valued at about $1 billion at the end of 1989, is
expected to double by the end of this year, surpassing that
from Japan and the U.S. Those two countries are tied for the
No. 2 position as China's biggest foreign investors, after
Hong Kong, which accounts for 60% of the total $15.4 billion
in actual investment as of the end of 1989.
   For Taiwan investors, long blocked from China by the two
nations' political differences, the slight easing of
relations recently has opened up a new investment frontier.
But with Washington and Beijing still trading words over
China's human-rights record since the Tiananmen killings and
multilateral lenders still reluctant to provide China with
new loans, the initial shock of June 4's brutality has been
slow to wear off for many foreign investors.
   In the wake of the killings, Allied-Signal the Morristown,
N.J., aerospace, automotive and engineering-materials
concern, suspended negotiations -- which were at an advanced
stage -- for an automotive-component joint venture. More
recently, William Lee, regional vice president of
Allied-Signal International, returned to China to meet with
officials to test the water, but he hasn't decided yet
whether to pursue the project.
   With the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, Western
businessmen are showing the kind of euphoria over the Eastern
European market's potential that they once felt for China's.
Eastern Europe has already diverted attention from China,
businessmen say, although it isn't clear whether that shift
has also cost China funds it might otherwise have received.
   China's current economic recession is another deterrent to
foreign investment. Starting from Beijing's austerity program
in late 1988, consumer demand has been steadily weakening.
   Many foreign investors who have remained in China have
toned down their expectations. N.V. Philips, one of the
biggest foreign investors in China's electronics industry,
has nine joint ventures. Cees J. Seelen, president of Philips
Electronics South East Asia Holding B.V., a unit of the Dutch
electronics giant, says the company will be "more selective"
in future commitments.
   Mr. Seelen concedes that weak consumer demand is squeezing
profit growth at the two Philips ventures that are up and
running, but he brushes aside concern over cloudy prospects
for the seven still at preparatory stages.
   One of the seven is a plant to make television picture
tubes, which was initiated when demand for TV sets was high.
With deepening economic retrenchment, domestic sales have
plunged 35% from 1988 levels of eight million to nine
million.
   Even the Shell-Nedlloyd port project, which belongs to the
type of investment preferred by Beijing, isn't entirely
austerity-proof. The plan calls for a $20 million investment
in facilities for the storage and handling of bulk chemicals
and oil near the Tianjin port. The project's Chinese partner,
the Port of Tianjin Authority, is strapped for cash to
complete the transportation facilities leading to the
proposed tanks, according to Shell's Mr. Brennand. As a
result, Shell is reconsidering the scale of investment in the
project.
   Besides rethinking the size of their China investments,
foreign companies also seem to be changing their basic
attitude about doing business in China. Initially drawn by
the lure of a market with 1.1 billion consumers, many
businessmen abandoned their usually hard-nosed attitude when
doing business in China. Now, they have become more pragmatic
and put more emphasis on the bottom line.
   Such is the attitude Allied-Signal's Mr. Lee adopted when
he returned to China recently to study whether the company
would continue to pursue the automotive-component venture.
"We are demanding more benefits to be provided in the area of
foreign-exchange balance, and asking the Chinese to provide
more specifics," he says.
   For its part, Beijing has also undergone a soul-searching
period. As the country's economic problems worsen,
tight-fisted central-government officials are allocating
scarce domestic and foreign funds in accordance with national
priorities. Beijing has always kept a priorities list, but
provincial officials routinely ignored it and favored
investments in fast-earning ventures such as hotels and
consumers goods. Then came Tiananmen, and everybody listened.
   Some foreign businessmen are seeing new advantages in the
central government's reassertion of authority. With Beijing
putting the brakes on consumption and spending, inflation and
construction costs also are being restrained. In addition,
more projects require Beijing's approval, which means that
proposals are more carefully screened.
   "My phone isn't ringing as much as before, but when it
does, the project has a higher chance of success," says Clark
Randt, a U.S. lawyer who specializes in China.
   But despite these advantages, the foreign-investment boom
is definitely over. Even in areas Beijing is targeting, it is
likely to attract only modest capital. That's because such
projects typically require long repayment periods that only a
few multinational companies can afford.
   Besides, many of these projects are only viable if the
output is mass-produced. And China, despite its huge
population, has only a small market for advanced
technological products. Ernesto Harry Grobe, general manager
of Siemens AG's Beijing office, says the sales of some of the
West German electronic group's products in China represent
only one day's production in one of the company's plants in
the West.

   DALLAS -- The former owner of a Texas thrift that failed
under the weight of fraudulent condominium-development loans
pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the federal deposit
insurance fund.
   Welba Lee "Bubba" Keetch Jr., who owned the defunct First
Savings &amp; Loan Association of Burkburnett, Texas, also
pleaded guilty to charges of mail fraud, misapplication of
thrift funds and illegally participating in the proceeds of a
loan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Burkburnett thrift was one of six Texas savings
associations that poured at least $750 million into land
acquisitions and condominium developments along Interstate
30, east of Dallas, in 1982 and 1983. Some 2,000 condominiums
were built, glutting the Dallas real estate market.
   The loans, which were inflated by fraudulent land
appraisals, also provided millions of dollars in profits for
the financiers and developers of the condominiums, according
to court records and the testimony of appraisers and
promoters who participated in the scheme.
   Mr. Keetch is one of 102 people who have been convicted of
federal crimes in connection with the condominium lending
scheme. He faces a maximum possible sentence of 13 years in
federal prison and a $275,000 fine. Mr. Keetch is scheduled
for sentencing Oct. 25 before Judge Barefoot Sanders of
Dallas.

   Sony Faces Complaint About Union Vote

   The National Labor Relations Board accused Sony Corp. of
America of violating federal labor laws in a campaign to oust
a clerical union from its New Jersey and New York facilities.
   In a complaint issued by the Newark, N.J., branch of the
NLRB, the federal agency claims the Sony Corp. unit
photographed employees who were union members and used the
photos in an anti-union videotape. The tape was shown to
workers shortly before they cast their votes in March to
decide whether to decertify the union. The election resulted
in a majority vote for decertification.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What constitutes an unfair labor practice, according to
the complaint, is the company's failure to explain the
purpose of the photos to representatives of Local 888 of the
United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, an
affiliate of the AFL-CIO.
   Union representatives had asked for such an explanation
after employees complained about invasion of privacy and
general uneasiness about having their pictures taken while
busy at work. The company had an obligation to explain the
actions, the NLRB claims, because the photographing affected
working conditions.
   "People were intimidated by the photographing," said Larry
Cary, a labor lawyer at the New York law firm Vladeck,
Waldman, Elias &amp; Engelhard, which represents the union. "It's
outrageous for the company to have invaded people's privacy
in this way, to use their pictures without their permission."
   Alfred E. Hayes, a Sony vice president in Park Ridge,
N.J., said, "We don't believe the pictures were a problem and
we believe that the election should not be set aside because
of a legal technicality." He added that Sony intends to
contest the NLRB's complaint.
   The complaint concerns Sony facilities in New York and six
New Jersey cities. A Sony memo dated March 7, 1990, shows
that decertification campaigns have been successful at Sony
facilities in other locations, including Niles, Ill., and
Hawaii. Mr. Hayes said that 300 of Sony's 10,000 employees in
the U.S. are unionized. The union involved in this dispute
represents the most Sony workers.
   In its complaint, the NLRB also charges that the company
used a raffle of a 27-inch television before the election to
"induce" employees to vote for the company and against the
union. "You can have promotional contests to stimulate
interest in an election," said Mr. Cary, "but in this case
the value of the TV was too high for the board to believe it
was not meant to sway votes."
   Mr. Cary said that if Sony is found to have had a legal
obligation to tell the union the reason for photographing the
employees, there may be an inference that unions have a right
to know the nature of an employer's anti-union campaign. "If
the board succeeds here, there may be a precedent for unions
to explore the strategies of employers," Mr. Cary said.
   If the NLRB wins its case at an administrative hearing and
in possible subsequent court hearings, it will have the right
to conduct a second election.

   SOVIETS SUE to halt U.S. watchmaker from selling "Soviet
Military Watch."
   A Moscow firm, Vremex, accused Gruen Marketing Corp. of
false advertising and unfair competition in claiming that a
line of $100 quartz watches is connected to the Soviet
military. The suit accuses Gruen, a unit of Jewelcor Inc., of
marketing the allegedly fake "Soviet field watch" to
capitalize on consumers' current interest in the U.S.S.R.
   Vremex -- which translates roughly into "Timex" -- is
seeking unspecified damages, a share of Gruen's profits and
corrective advertising. Vremex said Gruen's product,
introduced at Manhattan's Russian Tea Room last year, is
making it harder for Vremex to market authentic Soviet
timepieces.
   Gruen, which says it is the official distributor of the
"red-hot fashion accessory" in the U.S., has touted the watch
in ads with the line: "Can 83,000 Soviet infantry commanders
be wrong? Nyet."
   In its suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Vremex
said, "The Gruen watch is not of Soviet origin,
authorization, sponsorship, design or manufacture. Nor is the
Gruen watch similar in style or design to watches actually
worn by the Soviet military." A spokeswoman for Gruen
declined to comment.
   The watch, packaged in a caviar tin, is decorated with a
red star and the letters, CCCP, the Cyrillic abbreviation of
U.S.S.R.

   FORMER OFFICER of defunct N.J. firm admits role in a bank
fraud scheme.
   Bruce M. Bloom, former chief financial officer of Coated
Sales Inc., pleaded guilty to allegations involving a $52
million fraud scheme in federal district court in Newark. Mr.
Bloom admitted that he and other officers of the defunct
textile converting firm lied about the amount of the
company's assets in order to secure a $52 million
restructuring loan from BancBoston Financial Co. in Boston
two years ago.
   Mr. Bloom faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine for one count of bank fraud.
   "The type of quick fix book-juggling admitted to in this
plea is a corporate tragedy," U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff
said. He wouldn't comment on other former Coated Sales
officials. Mr. Chertoff added that the company's collapse has
been estimated to have cost stockholders close to $100
million.
   Mr. Chertoff said BancBoston has reached a settlement with
four other banks that held accounts for the company.
   Shortly before Coated Sales filed for bankruptcy-court
protection in June 1988, the company was considered one of
the fastest-growing stocks on the Nasdaq over-the-counter
market, according to Mr. Chertoff. By securing the loan with
fictitious accounts receivable, the officers boosted the
corporation's net sales, total assets and earnings per share,
he said.
   Mr. Bloom's attorney didn't return phone calls.

   DIVORCED MOTHER allowed to relocate by a New York appeals
court.
   The state appeals court in Ithaca, N.Y., overturned a
lower court decision barring Marie Reyes from moving
out-of-state with her children.
   Traditionally, the courts have been reluctant to allow
divorced parents to move to distant locations except under
unusual circumstances. The courts don't want to adversely
affect the visitation rights of the non-custodial parent.
   Ms. Reyes, who was divorced in 1989, had asked the court
for permission to move to Laramie, Wyo., where her present
husband is a tenured professor at the University of Wyoming.
Christopher A. Ball, Ms. Reyes's former husband and the
father of her children, had opposed the move.
   In an unusual ruling, the appeals panel approved the move,
saying it would result in better educational and economic
opportunities for Ms. Reyes. In addition, the panel found
that the proposed relocation would result in Mr. Ball seeing
his children for longer durations and wouldn't unreasonably
disrupt his relationship with them. The court also reversed a
lower court decision awarding joint custody and gave Ms.
Reyes sole custody of the children.
   "We live in a mobile society," said Cecile C. Weich, a
Riverdale, N.Y., lawyer representing Ms. Reyes. "The courts
have begun to recognize the fact that women and men will want
to move to join and form new families and to seek new
economic opportunities."
   But Richard Stumbar, a lawyer for Mr. Ball, said that both
Ms. Reyes and her husband can find work in New York and there
is no compelling reason for the move. Mr. Stumbar, of the
Ithaca firm Bixler &amp; Stumbar, said his client has appealed
the decision.
   "The decision is a departure and a weakening of the rights
of the non-residential parent with respect to the children,"
said Mr. Stumbar.

   NORIEGA CO-DEFENDANT is sentenced to 10 years in prison on
drug charges.
   Enrique Pretelt, a Panamanian businessman and former close
associate of deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, had
pleaded guilty in federal court in Tampa, Fla., in June to
two felonies -- conspiring with Mr. Noriega to import drugs
and launder money, and attempting to import 400,000 pounds of
marijuana into the U.S. through Panama.
   His pledge to cooperate with the prosecution is expected
to bolster the government's case against Mr. Noriega, who is
awaiting trial on drug charges.
   As part of his plea, Mr. Pretelt forfeited $108,000 in
proceeds from his drug activities to the U.S., the
prosecution said. The judge said he would reconsider Mr.
Pretelt's sentence after he completes cooperation on the
Noriega case.

   LONDON -- History has known scores of kings in exile. Now
there is an economy in exile.
   Welcome to the new Kuwait. You can find it at the local
Kuwaiti bank branch here that is suddenly headquarters for a
multinational financial giant. And at the London Bridge City
property development along the River Thames. And at the local
office of the Kuwait state oil company, one of Europe's
largest gasoline retailers. Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
two weeks ago, London has become the refuge and headquarters
of most of Kuwait's exiled business leaders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   They are keeping their country's vast international
financial and business empire going -- and even thriving --
despite the occupation of their home by a foreign power and
world-wide restrictions on asset transfers that hamper normal
operations. "Kuwait's assets can, to a great extent, function
in exile -- however unjust the exile is," says a spokesman
for United Bank of Kuwait PLC, a big London-based bank owned
by Kuwaitis.
   With $100 billion in overseas investments, Kuwait's wealth
long has given it international economic clout beyond its
tiny size. Its economy is three times the size of Greece's.
It pumps gasoline from Stockholm to Rome. It commands one of
the world's largest tanker fleets. It owns U.S. real estate,
Malaysian plantations and such blue-chip investments as
roughly 14% of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, just under 20% of
chemical giant Hoechst AG and 10% of Britain's Midland Bank
PLC. In the U.S., it owns Santa Fe International Corp., a San
Francisco-based oil and gas concern. That global scope has
made the events since the Iraqi invasion more than just
another scramble by some rich Arabs to get themselves and
their money out.
   Kuwait's senior businessmen, financiers and money managers
are gearing up to make their economy-in-exile a force to be
reckoned with. If they succeed, they may be able to bring
enormous financial influence to bear on the debate over the
future of their country.
   "We may not have been able to defend ourselves
militarily," says a former Kuwaiti cabinet minister now in
London. "But we have resources."
   And though Kuwaiti politicians haven't made any official
promises, the average exile-on-the-street in London is all
for using the wealth to bankroll the Western military
campaign. "If you ask any Kuwaiti, they are ready to pay,"
says Abdulla Alsaleh, a Kuwaiti real-estate developer now in
exile here. "What Mr. Bush has done is excellent. It's fair.
We should pay our part of the cost."
   In a coffee shop in a Kuwaiti neighborhood behind
Selfridge's, the posh London department store, the
52-year-old Mr. Alsaleh laments that his Kuwaiti credit cards
are now worthless. The local National Bank of Kuwait branch,
where he has an account, is limiting withdrawals to #1,000
($1,900) a week. And the British private school where he
plans to enroll two children this autumn charges #6,000 a
year. "They say they will take it in installments," he says.
"We have to control costs."
   His friend, a Kuwaiti broker at Shearson Lehman Inc.'s
London office, enters the coffee shop. The broker says he
spent the first few days after the invasion calming his many
Kuwaiti clients-in-exile, fearful for their investments;
they're all safe, though global asset restrictions prevent
them from transferring funds out of Britain. Even customers
still trapped in Kuwait aren't entirely cut off. One trading
order was smuggled out over the desert.
   "It's `Desert DHL,'" Mr. Alsaleh chortles.
   Mr. Alsaleh, whom the invasion trapped in London while he
was vacationing with his family, affects a jovial mien -- but
he's clearly worried. "I'm trying to organize my life," he
says. Though he professes confidence that he will one day
return to his Kuwaiti business and properties, "it may take
some time."
   While waiting, the Kuwaitis have formed their
financial-establishment-in-exile around the nucleus of the
Kuwait Investment Office, which controls much of Kuwait's
global portfolio. Key people include Khaled al-Sabah, deputy
general manager and chief day-to-day controller of the
office, who has been in London most of the week. Also in
London is the governor of the Kuwaiti central bank, and
numerous private bankers. Other officials, from the oil
minister to the managing director of the Kuwait Investment
Authority -- who escaped overland in a 48-hour dash across
Iraqi lines several days ago -- also are in frequent contact
with London from the Persian Gulf and elsewhere.
   In a stuffy conference room across London, the management
board of National Bank of Kuwait meets in exile, many
directors having escaped days earlier in furtive trips across
the desert.
   "We are establishing a sort of informal cabinet," says a
senior Kuwaiti monetary official involved in the group. "A
substantial portion of the human infrastructure has gotten
out of Kuwait. With the assets and people out of the hands of
the invading powers, Kuwait is able to pull its act together
and reorganize to be more effective -- no matter how long it
takes for the situation to go back to normal."
   For the moment, the situation is anything but normal. The
asset freeze imposed by most Western governments means
Kuwaiti holdings overseas generally can't be moved across
borders or disbursed. But U.S. and U.K. authorities, in
particular, have been flexible with the exiled Kuwaiti
businessmen; Kuwait Petroleum, for instance, can now transfer
funds around its European operations. And most private
Western bankers, on the advice of their countries' central
banks, have resumed many dealings with the Kuwaitis. A
crucial factor in gaining this status, bankers say, was that
so many of their countries' exiled financial leaders were
directly on hand in London to prove to authorities that they
-- and not Iraq -- were in control of the Kuwaiti assets.
   Thus, in the New Bond Street offices of Kuwait Petroleum,
an unusual drama is unfolding of an oil giant making do
without a home country or its own oil. The company, operating
in Europe under the apt "Q8" brand name, owns a vast network
of 6,533 gasoline stations and three refineries, also in
Europe, to retail Kuwaiti petroleum products. Now, under its
exiled directors, it's scrambling to keep the business going
by buying oil from others. Competitors confirm it is
succeeding.
   "We're optimistic" about securing Saudi crude, says David
Robson, marketing director of Kuwait Petroleum International
Ltd., the company's European marketing arm. "We will continue
like any other oil company," buying oil from producers and
refining and marketing it.
   At the investment office, officials also have succeeded --
with the aid of the Bank of England -- in ensuring the office
can continue to invest with some semblance of normalcy. But
traders and bankers familiar with the investment office
suggest that the upheaval caused by the asset freeze may lead
the agency -- which had become a more-aggressive investor in
recent years -- to lower its profile. The office may raise
cash and reduce its long-term block holdings, they say.
   The logic behind such a move, traders say, is that it
would keep the fund more liquid to provide capital to the
Kuwaiti government in exile and avoid possible investment
restrictions by governments concerned about the strategic
ramifications of a large Kuwaiti holding.
   Officials of the Kuwait Investment Office declined to
comment for this article.
   As news of Iraq's invasion rocked the world financial
markets nearly two weeks ago, fund managers at the Kuwaiti
office and other Arab funds in London quickly decided to
reduce their exposure to the markets.
   Kuwaiti financial executives "wanted to be liquid"
immediately following the invasion, says Robert L. Thomas,
director at Midland Bank PLC's Midland Montagu international
financial unit, a London institution that trades with the
Kuwaiti office.
   Over the longer term, the asset freeze raises legal
questions that could lead to years of litigation among
Kuwaitis with claims to the assets and banks with
counterclaims. "There is too much money just to sit there for
five or six years," says Prof. Harold Koh, an international
law expert at Yale Law School.
   The biggest question is who owns the assets. In the long
term, the assets belong to the Kuwaiti people, most of whom
are still in the country. Indeed, the investment office's
reason for existence is to invest the proceeds of oil revenue
to benefit future generations when the wells run dry.
However, the entity that has always controlled the assets is
the internationally recognized Kuwaiti government -- now in
exile -- which would seem to have strongest legal claim to
managing the holdings.
   Kuwait continues to have expenses for its embassies and
for its ruling family -- and these claims are likely to be
the first to cross central bankers' desks.

   Involving $6.5 Billion in Back Taxes

   NEW YORK -- Exxon Corp. said it filed suit against the
U.S. government in a decade-old tax case that, if it loses,
could cost the company $6.5 billion in back taxes.
   The petition, which involves Exxon's income taxes for the
years 1980 through 1982, was filed yesterday in the U.S. Tax
Court in Washington. Exxon expects the litigation to go to
trial sometime next year. The company also said that although
it expects to prevail in court, it has put aside reserves
that it called "adequate" to cover any potential liabilities.

<TEXT>
   The major issue, Exxon officials say, involves the pricing
of crude bought from Saudi Arabia from 1980 through 1982. The
oil giant is already in court over a $500 million tax claim
also involving Saudi purchases dating back to 1979. The
petition filed yesterday consolidates the two actions.
   Exxon said that $1.5 billion of the $6.5 billion being
sought by the government for those years reflects the dispute
over the pricing of Saudi oil. Counting the 1979 claim, that
brings the total claims relating to that issue to $2 billion.
   The company said it is resisting another $5 billion in
various other IRS claims for the 1980-82 period, including
attempts to disallow such items as standard depreciation and
foreign tax credits. Exxon said it has supplied the
appropriate documents to support such credits and
depreciation, but said the federal agency is contending it
hasn't had adequate time to complete its review. The audit
started 2 1/2 years ago.
   IRS officials declined to comment on the case, saying they
hadn't seen the petition.
   Between 1979 and 1981, oil prices soared to as high as $40
a barrel on the spot market as a result of the chaos
following the Iranian revolution. The Saudis, partly at the
request of the U.S. government, increased their output and
sold oil at prices below market. Official Saudi selling
prices in the period never broke $34 a barrel.
   The Internal Revenue Service alleges that during those
years, several oil companies made enormous profits buying
such relatively low-priced oil from Saudi Arabia and turning
it into products sold at market prices. The chief
beneficiaries were the U.S. shareholders of the
Saudi-American consortium called Arabian American Oil Co. --
Exxon, Texaco Inc., Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. The ability
of those companies to buy cheap Saudi crude was referred to
as the "Aramco Advantage" by the industry.
   Exxon, and presumably the others, resold the bulk of the
Saudi oil to U.S. and foreign affiliates at the official
Saudi price, industry sources say. The kingdom wouldn't allow
the companies to reap windfall profits by reselling the oil
at higher market prices. The companies refined the crude and
sold the resulting products at market prices in the U.S. as
well as overseas.
   The four U.S. companies were in a position to profit
greatly from the arrangement through the sale of the refined
products because the crude was costing them less than their
competitors. But Exxon's general tax counsel, William D.
O'Brien, yesterday contested such allegations, saying that
the savings were passed on to consumers. He also said that
appropriate taxes regarding those sales were paid to both
U.S. and foreign governments.
   Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl in a statement yesterday
called IRS claims for back taxes "totally unwarranted." He
maintained that Saudi Arabia would have refused to sell the
crude to the oil majors if they had violated its directive
prohibiting them from reselling the oil at the higher market
prices. And consumers in the end would have ended up paying
even higher prices than they did, he said.
   But the IRS has refused to budge. So, Texaco, as well as
Exxon, is currently preparing to go to trial to fight similar
claims by the agency. The IRS claims that Texaco owes about
$1.8 billion in back taxes and interest to the federal
government for the years 1979 through 1981. Neither Mobil nor
Chevron are involved in litigation with the agency at this
time.

   3rd-Period Net
   Of $6 Million

   CHICAGO -- Navistar International Corp. eked out a fiscal
third-quarter profit amid signs that the slump in the truck
industry is worsening.
   Earnings were slightly better than expected; some analysts
had expected the company to report a small loss.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The maker of trucks and diesel engines said net income for
the quarter ended July 31 dropped 79% to $6 million from $28
million, or eight cents a share, it earned for the similar
1989 quarter. The company said its per-share net income for
the latest period was less than a penny because of its
obligation to pay dividends on the Series G preferred stock.
   Revenue dropped 10% to $972 million from $1.08 billion.
Navistar said the number of medium and heavy trucks it sold
in the quarter sank 15% from a year ago.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Navistar fell 37.5 cents to $2.875. The stock was the
second-most-active issue on the Big Board, with almost 2.2
million shares traded.
   Navistar trimmed its estimate of industrywide demand for
trucks in North America -- signaling that a recovery in truck
orders probably isn't materializing as expected. After
slumping in 1989, industrywide new truck orders have been
stable at low levels for several months.
   With more economists predicting recession, Navistar
trimmed its fiscal year forecast by 2,000 to 140,000 heavy
trucks, which would be down 19% from last year. Industrywide
demand for medium-sized trucks will probably drop 6%, the
company said.
   Truck sales could drop further still if the Middle East
conflict raises fuel prices for a prolonged period, analysts
said.
   Because Iraq's invasion of Kuwait disrupted Middle East
oil supplies, the price of fuel has jumped more than 30% for
some transportation companies. That is eroding profit margins
at the large truck fleets, which might prompt some to slow
purchases.
   "Earlier in the year we thought there was a possibility
that sales would turn positive in the second half of the
year," said Larry D. Hollis, a securities analyst at Robert
W. Baird &amp; Co. in Milwaukee. "That increasingly isn't
likely."
   Navistar said it plans to build 4% fewer trucks in the
fourth quarter compared with the year-earlier period.
   Wall Street analysts expect Navistar to break even on an
operating basis for the quarter ending Oct. 31.
   With the economy apparently weakening, however, some
analysts are speculating that manufacturers such as Navistar
might have to set aside more money to cover potential losses
on loans to customers and dealers.
   "The truckers are getting incredibly squeezed," said
Mitchell I. Quain, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, New York.
Mr. Quain has been recommending that his clients sell the
stock.
   Analysts said they aren't aware of any problem with the
quality of the loans made by Navistar. But the loan-loss
provisions in the third quarter for the company's credit unit
and manufacturing operations were about $7 million -- an
amount that analysts said might be too small. Receivables at
those businesses total about $1.5 billion.
   A company spokesman wouldn't confirm the loan-loss
provisions, describing that information as proprietary. "We
believe they are adequate," the spokesman said.

   Canadian Rates
   Fall on Strength
   Of Nation's Dollar

   OTTAWA -- Key Canadian interest rates fell yesterday
mainly because of the continuing strength of the Canadian
dollar, financial analysts said.
   The Bank of Canada's influential bank rate fell 0.27
percentage point to 13.07%, its lowest level since February.
The bank rate, which has declined for eight consecutive
weeks, is the levy the central bank charges on loans to
financial institutions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The drop was followed by a decline in the prime lending
rates of most commercial banks to 14.25% from 14.75%, which
was the first across-the-board prime rate cut since October
1987. The Bank of Montreal lowered its prime rate to 14.25%
earlier this week.
   In a surprise move yesterday, the central bank failed to
resist market pressures to drive three-month treasury bill
rates below the 13.05% level. The bank rate is set each week
at 0.25 percentage point above the average yield on
three-month bills at the Thursday auction.
   Aron Gampel, senior economist with Bank of Nova Scotia,
said the decline in interest rates reflected the continuing
strength of the Canadian dollar, which has been pushed up in
recent weeks to its highest level in 10 years. Mr. Gampel
said the Canadian currency has been buoyed by wide spreads
between comparable Canadian and U.S. short-term interest
rates and by higher oil prices.
   Mr. Gampel said the Bank of Canada has lowered interest
rates in recent weeks to offset the contractionary effect of
a higher Canadian dollar. The Bank of Canada has estimated
that a one percentage point rise in the Canadian dollar is
roughly equivalent to a 0.50 percentage point decline in
short-term interest rates.
   The Canadian dollar fell on the interest rate decline,
closing in Toronto at 87.09 U.S. cents, down from 87.44 U.S.
cents on Wednesday.
   The Toronto Stock Exchange composite share index rose 1.91
points to close at 3509.99 yesterday.
   Patti Croft, an economist with the Toronto-based
securities firm Burns Fry Ltd., said the interest rate
decline also reflected, in part, "mounting evidence of
weakness" in the Canadian economy. In May, the most recent
month for which data is available, Canada's gross domestic
product fell 0.2% from the previous month.
   Derek Jones, senior economist with Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce, said yesterday's interest rate decline was
unlikely to prevent the onset of a "mild recession" in
Canada. But Mr. Jones said the cut would "slow the rate of
deterioration in the Canadian economy."
   Analysts predicted that short-term Canadian interest rates
will continue to decline moderately in coming weeks as long
as the Canadian dollar remains firm.
   Bank of Nova Scotia's Mr. Gampel said the central bank
will maintain a "cautious" monetary policy because it is
still concerned about inflationary pressures in the economy,
including recent high wage settlements and higher energy
prices.
   Statistics Canada is to report today Canada's consumer
price index for July. Randall Powley, senior economist with
Scotia-McLeod Inc., estimated that the index rose 0.6% in
July from a month earlier and 4.3% from a year earlier. He
said the year-over-year rate is likely to climb up to the 5%
range in coming months, partly because of higher energy
costs.
   Mr. Powley predicted that Canadian short-term interest
rates will level off later this year as the introduction of
the government's proposed 7% consumption tax approaches. The
new tax, which is to be introduced Jan. 1, if it is approved
by the Canadian Senate, is expected to boost Canada's
consumer price index by a one-time increase of 1.25
percentage points.

   U.S. Offers Turkey
   Loan Guarantees
   For Arms Purchase

   WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank, reacting to the
needs of a U.S. ally caught in the Persian Gulf crisis, said
it is ready to provide more than $1 billion in loan
guarantees to finance the sale of U.S. military helicopters
to Turkey.
   Ex-Im Bank Chairman John Macomber said the board and a
cabinet-level committee that oversees the bank's loan
policies gave it the go-ahead to offer the guarantees if a
U.S. vendor wins the huge award for 200 helicopters. The
likely U.S. supplier is United Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky
division, which last month clinched another contract to
supply the Turkish National Police with S-70A Blackhawk
helicopters with the help of $37.7 million in loan guarantees
from the Ex-Im Bank.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest prospective deal signals a turning point in
U.S. arms-export policy. The bank traditionally has shied
away from the defense trade, insisting that its limited
resources be used to finance nonmilitary U.S. business. Its
Turkey decision, however, shows the bank is willing to serve
as financier for U.S. arms sales to middle-income allies that
can't afford to pay cash for U.S. weapons.
   Mr. Macomber said the gulf crisis surrounding Turkey was a
factor in the bank's decision. "We had to do something faster
than usual" because of the crisis.
   The Bush administration has been quietly crafting a new
policy to help U.S. defense contractors expand their export
sales. Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state,
last month ordered U.S. ambassadors to get on board by
helping open doors for U.S. defense vendors, according to his
aides.
   The use of Ex-Im Bank financing, however, had remained a
"sticking point" in forming the new policy, the aides said. A
policy paper recommending its use for defense sales remains
stuck in the Office of Management and Budget because of
concerns by some White House aides about the propriety of
expending the bank's resources in this manner.
   Mr. Macomber said the prospective Turkish deal is
specifically authorized by a law passed last year that
authorizes such guarantees for military sales to Turkey and
Greece. Democratic Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut
spearheaded the effort to pass this and other laws that
effectively give such companies as United Technologies, based
in Hartford, Conn., wider access to Ex-Im Bank financing.
   The Ex-Im Bank's role of financing arms sales to other
allies could become policy if an amendment to the Export
Administration Act introduced by Sens. Dodd and Christopher
Bond (R. Mo.) becomes law. The Senate is scheduled to
consider changes to the export act when it returns from its
August recess.
   U.S. defense industry spokesmen said Sikorsky is facing
tough competition for the Turkish sale from French and
Italian vendors, which have the solid backing of their
governments.

   GE Aircraft Engine
   To Lose 1,500 Jobs
   As Military Cuts Back

   EVENDALE, Ohio -- General Electric Co.'s aircraft engine
division will eliminate 1,500 jobs, mostly through attrition,
in response to cuts in military spending.
   GE Aircraft Engine said that even though its commercial
business is up significantly from a year earlier, the backlog
of orders "will not be enough" to offset the predicted cuts.
The backlog currently is about $20 billion, with orders for
delivery over the next 10 years, it said. The backlog two
years ago was $12.4 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A GE spokesman said that since 1987 the commercial part of
the aircraft engine business has absorbed about 5,000
employees from the military side. He said 47% of the aircraft
engine's $6.8 billion in revenue last year came from military
contracts. That percentage is expected to drop to 35% by
1992.
   The cutbacks will be shared equally by the unit's Lynn,
Mass., and Evendale, Ohio, operations. Attrition will account
for about 1,000 jobs over the next 18 months, and the
remaining 500 people will be laid off. GE Aircraft Engine
employs 46,170 people in the U.S.
   The layoffs reflect the cancellation of the Navy's P-7
anti-submarine attack aircraft, a reduction in the Air
Force's program for B-2 bombers, and a delayed production
schedule for the Navy's A-12 fighter plane, among other
cutbacks.
   These are the first significant layoffs at the aircraft
engine division in response to defense spending cuts. Last
April, GE's aerospace division announced that it would
eliminate 4,200 jobs, farm out production of standard
component parts, and consolidate several plants.

   As Jet-Buying Fever Seems to Cool Off,
   Industry Fears an Unexpectedly Big Chill

   Jet buyers appear to be closing their wallets after a
two-year spending spree, and some aircraft-industry players
worry the retrenchment could lead to an unexpectedly big
downturn.
   As the market for large commercial aircraft softens, plane
sellers, parts suppliers and carriers say an overcapacity of
passenger jets -- particularly narrow-bodies -- has surfaced
during the past few months, especially in the U.S.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It's a situation that was in the making even before the
Iraqis stormed into Kuwait, forcing oil prices higher. And it
threatens to damp expansion plans at the Big Three aircraft
manufacturers, Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. and the
European consortium Airbus Industrie.
   "At the moment, you can't say it's terribly serious, but
there is certainly cause for concern," says Paul Turk, an
analyst at Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm. "The
airlines have been adding seats faster than the system can
absorb them. That depresses yields. And if we continue to see
a fall in passenger traffic and the continuation of depressed
yields, carriers are going to start walking away" from
aircraft buys.
   Airline yields, important indicators, measure the amount
of revenue for each mile they fly a passenger.
   Some airline executives who refrained from placing huge
orders are now openly gloating. "Some of these plane orders
are coming back to roost," says Trans World Airlines owner
Carl Icahn, who only ordered limited numbers of jets in
recent years. "Everybody was jumping on that bandwagon, and
I'm glad that we didn't." Mr. Icahn says the $1.2 billion TWA
has in cash will be more valuable than a fleet of new planes
in an economic downturn. A recession could badly hurt the
struggling carrier.
   "Domestic growth just isn't occurring at the rates most
had been expecting," says an executive at one major aerospace
supplier. His company predicts that airliner deliveries will
average about 600 a year through the end of the decade -- not
a level of more than 1,000, which is the figure arrived at if
the projected production schedules at the Big Three are
totaled. "Six hundred is wonderful," he says, "but somebody
is wrong, and swings can still kill companies."
   Many experts discount the Doomsday predictions, noting
that orders for wide-body jetliners remain robust and air
traffic continues to surge on international routes, primarily
in the Pacific Rim. The East Bloc, meanwhile, could turn into
a fertile selling ground for Western plane makers.
   At Farnborough, the aerospace industry's big air show next
month in England, each of the Big Three is likely to announce
a number of large bookings. On top of that, UAL Corp.'s
United Airlines remains ready to purchase as much as $15
billion in aircraft once its buy-out situation becomes
clearer; British Airways PLC, among others, is also shopping
around.
   Still, the overall trend in firm orders is decidedly
downward. Boeing has received bookings for 255 jets, valued
at $24 billion, so far this year, compared with 659 aircraft
valued at $34 billion to this point in 1989, a record amount.
At McDonnell Douglas, orders have slipped to 103 planes from
113.
   Across the industry, placements for narrow-body aircraft
dropped 59% through June to 312 from 766.
   Lawrence Harris, an aerospace analyst at Bateman Eichler,
Hill Richards Inc., says he recently scaled back his
projections for new orders this year at market leader Boeing
to $40 billion from $45 billion, and he sees the figure
falling to $25 billion for 1993. But he believes the decline
shouldn't have much of an effect on the manufacturer's
profitability. That's because the Seattle company is working
off a backlog that already is big enough to keep it busy for
three or four years, and that reservoir should continue to
swell through 1992.
   A Boeing spokesman notes that the company is pushing ahead
with plans to launch a new twin-jet, the 777, and remains
firmly committed to ramping up its production rates.
   "We're not getting calls for wholesale cancellations,"
adds William Messecar, a top business planner for McDonnell
Douglas's commercial aircraft unit in Long Beach, Calif. "If
you look at the order curve of the past few years, we just
can't keep going up that slope. But that doesn't mean the
industry is going in the tank, either."
   Yet others are more bearish, predicting that if the
economy slows enough, "options," or less-than-total
commitments that airlines have taken for planes, could
evaporate. Even firm orders, some say, could begin to
disappear.
   "The timing of a recession matters a lot when it comes to
buying and selling aircraft," says Jerry Lundquist, who has
done a detailed analysis of the commercial jet market for
McKinsey &amp; Co., the management consultants.
   His research suggests the start of a long, largely
unanticipated slide in orders and, ultimately, less output
from the Big Three. One big factor in his analysis, he says,
is that older Boeing 727s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9s aren't
being retired as quickly as many had anticipated. Even with
the improved fuel-burn and smaller cockpit crews that newer
planes feature, "older aircraft are still economically
competitive," Mr. Lundquist contends.
   Coupled with the spate of newer planes starting to be
delivered, the result is the current glut of narrow-bodies.
"The industry has gone through this again and again," Mr.
Lundquist says. "It's either feast or famine."
   At some point, of course, the recent aircraft buying
frenzy will squeeze the oldest planes into retirement. But
because of the flood of available aircraft, the resale market
will weaken.
   And if airlines are getting less money for their older
planes as they turn them over to freight haulers and other
secondary users, it crimps their ability to make capital
outlays for new aircraft.
   Already, the market's foundation seems to be cracking a
bit. In June, USAir Group Inc. postponed delivery of a dozen
Boeing 737s for more than three years because of slowing
traffic growth, although at the same time it placed orders
for 24 additional planes. Marc Desautels, president of
Polaris Aircraft Leasing Corp., says he understands that
other deferrals by airlines "are in the works."
   Among the carriers that may backtrack, Delta Air Lines is
said to be studying a decision not to exercise options on
some MD-80s, although the company says it won't do that.
Midway Airlines already has canceled some of its options on
MD80s. The small Chicago-based carrier also plans to return
three DC-9s to a leasing company at the end of the third
quarter when the leases expire.
   Midway executives say it's a good thing that new planes
they have ordered won't be delivered until the end of 1991,
limiting fleet growth until then. "We think the economic
climate is soft," says Alfred Altschul, the company's chief
financial officer.
   The Persian Gulf crisis, with its accompanying rise in
fuel costs and threat of economic repercussions, only
exacerbates the potential for worsening profits at the
airlines and, in turn, plane makers. "It's grim," says
Michael Gunn, senior vice president of marketing at American
Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp. Recently, American officials
started reducing their traffic-growth expectations based on
advance booking levels, which indicate how many seats are
reserved on a flight before it departs.

   WASHINGTON -- The government released new evidence that
the U.S. economy was already deeply troubled by inflation and
a deteriorating construction sector before the Middle East
crisis sent the price of oil soaring.
   Consumer prices rose 0.4% in July, a month in which energy
prices were falling, the Labor Department said. Over the
first seven months of the year, the department said, consumer
prices have been rising at a 5.8% annual rate.
</LP>

   With the inflation rate already approaching 6% this year,
some analysts believe the oil-price jump in the aftermath of
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait earlier this month could push it
toward 7%. And even if a weak economy keeps price rises more
moderate than that, 1990 now seems certain to produce the
highest inflation rate in nine years.
   Also during July, housing starts fell for the sixth
straight month, dropping 2.6% to an annual rate of 1.14
million, their lowest level since September 1982, during the
last recession, the Commerce Department reported.
   The new reports underscore the extreme difficulty of the
dilemma that will face the Federal Reserve's policy committee
at its meeting next week. The central bank is under pressure
from the Bush administration to cushion the economy by
lowering interest rates. But the new figures suggest that
while the economy seems weak enough to need a jump-start,
inflation pressures persist even apart from the oil jolt.
   "They are faced with an impossible and some sense
paralyzing set of factors," said Neal Soss, chief economist
at First Boston Corp. in New York.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 oil prices shot up, and
economists and government officials worried that the shock
could plunge the already lethargic U.S. economy into a
recession.
   For the past five quarters the economy has grown at an
annual rate of less than 2%, due largely to the Federal
Reserve's efforts to curb inflation by keeping interest rates
high.
   A report last week that producer prices fell in July
helped bolster the view that Fed policy makers would feel
comfortable allowing interest rates to fall, given evidence
that inflation, apart from energy prices, was under control.
   But yesterday's consumer price report said that energy
prices dropped 0.7% in July and that, excluding them,
consumer prices rose 0.5%. Excluding both energy and food --
which economists often do because of frequent price swings in
those categories -- consumer prices rose 0.6% last month. In
June, prices rose 0.6% excluding energy and 0.4% excluding
energy and food.
   The numbers unnerved some traders in the financial
markets, helping to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average
down 66.83 yesterday.
   Joel Popkin, an inflation expert who heads an economic
forecasting firm in Washington, said the latest reading of
the consumer price index, the most widely watched gauge of
inflation, shows that the Fed's policy of fighting inflation
by keeping economic activity slow but growing hasn't worked.
   But he also warned that the consequences of a recession
could be very grave.
   "If we were to enter a recession right now, the economy is
more vulnerable than at any time I can remember in the 35
years I've been watching the U.S. economy," he said, citing
the country's huge budget and trade deficits, the cost of
bailing out the S&amp;L industry and the high debt levels of many
American corporations.
   "My view is if we entered a recession, there is no basis
that economists have to predict how long or how deep that
recession would be."
   Whether the economy sinks into recession could depend not
only on the Fed but also on whether consumers and businesses
react to higher oil prices by curbing spending in other
areas.
   Mr. Popkin estimates that "every $1 increase in a barrel
of oil drains $6.2 billion at an annual rate from the
purchasing power of people who buy energy." And, he adds,
"half of that leaves the country, if our oil is imported."
   Though energy prices are sure to boost the next round of
inflation figures, there has been little evidence so far that
businesses are planning to pass increases in their energy
costs through to their customers.
   "We are going to see large energy-price increases next
month," said Sally Kleinman, an economist at Manufacturers
Hanover Securities Corp. "Then, depending how long that level
is sustained, that will start to feed through into other
goods -- plastics, all things that use petrochemicals."
   Rises in the prices of tobacco and a category that mostly
includes hotel and motel bills accounted for a considerable
portion of the overall rise in the July consumer price index.
Medical costs continued to soar, jumping 0.9% after a 0.7%
rise in June. Entertainment costs climbed 0.6% following
June's 0.2% rise. Food prices grew 0.4% after a 0.7% increase
in June. Housing costs, a category that includes energy,
maintenance and other renters' and homeowners' costs, rose
0.5% on top of a 0.6% increase in June.
   The Commerce Department said every region of the country
but the West saw a decline in new housing construction in
July. Overall, work began on single-family homes, the core of
the housing market, at an annual rate of 873,000, down 1.4%
from June. The number of building permits issued during the
month dropped 2.6%, to a 1.07 million annual rate.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said that the
average weekly earnings of American workers grew 0.3% in July
after taking inflation into account. In June they rose 0.2%.
   The figures in all the reports were adjusted for seasonal
variations.

   NRC Probing
   Its Licensing
   Of Seabrook

   The inspector general of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
is investigating the agency's licensing of the Seabrook
nuclear power plant, amid lingering questions about adequate
evacuation plans.
   The action, conducted by the commission inspector general
David Williams, is unusual and throws at least some
uncertainty on Seabrook's full-power start-up timetable. But
some analysts remain optimistic that the investigation
probably won't lead to a revocation of Seabrook's license.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The $6.6 billion power plant, in Seabrook, N.H., has
demonstrated an ability to operate at 100% capacity in trial
runs and is ready for regular full-power production.
   The Seabrook plant is owned by 11 New England utilities,
including Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, with a 35.6%
stake. PS New Hampshire filed for bankruptcy-law protection
in 1988 because it couldn't service its Seabrook debt.
Another Seabrook holder, Northeast Utilities, has agreed to
acquire PS New Hampshire in a deal valued at about $2.3
billion.
   "This comes at a very awkward time for Seabrook, and it
puts the financial community in a cautious mode," said Daniel
Scotto, a bond analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. "It's a hard one to call. We don't really
have any precedent of NRC investigative activity to go by."
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares of PS
New Hampshire and Northeast Utilities were unchanged at
$2.625 and $19.75, respectively.
   In 1981 the commission conducted an investigation of
seismic safety designs for the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power
Plant in Northern California. That resulted in a temporary
suspension of a low-power testing license the facility had
received. The plant eventually received a full operating
license.
   "I'd be very surprised if the Seabrook investigation leads
to anything serious," said Paul Parshley, a bond analyst at
Lehman Brothers. "The momentum was clearly on the side of
Seabrook, and I don't think anyone would have wanted to
jeopardize {getting} a license by doing something
inappropriate at the time."
   A public report of the investigation is expected to be
issued in about a month.
   If the inspector general finds wrongdoing, he can
recommend certain actions to the full commission, which will
decide whether or not to act on his findings.
   At issue in the licensing inquiry is whether there was any
wrongdoing by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, an
advisory group to the commission. The board's recommendation
that Seabrook be licensed was made public on Nov. 13, 1989.
But, according to a memorandum from the board's chairman,
Ivan Smith, Mr. Williams hypothesizes that the licensing
board, only four days earlier, decided not to recommend an
operating license.
   The memo, released by the commission this week, said Mr.
Williams is trying to determine whether the reversal "was
corruptly induced by NRC officers and corruptly made by
members of the licensing board." Messrs. Smith and Williams
have confirmed the investigation, but wouldn't comment on it.
   A Seabrook spokesman said the licensing was recommended
Nov. 9 and that the recommendation wasn't made public until
Nov. 13.
   Anti-nuclear activists note that if the licensing board
recommended licensing on Nov. 9, it came only two days after
the Atomic and Safety Appeals Board, another NRC committee,
outlined aspects of evacuation plans that still needed
addressing.
   They included identifying and mapping evacuation plans for
critically ill patients and other disabled persons living
within a 10-mile radius; providing shelter for beachgoers who
might be stranded; and reaching an agreement with teachers
for the care of school children. Most of these issues haven't
been resolved.
   "None of these issues could have been adequately addressed
{during the two days} between the appeals board order and the
time of the licensing recommendation," said Robert Backus, an
attorney for the Seacoast Anti-Pollution League, a Seabrook
opponent.

   BUSH'S SUCCESS in the Gulf crisis obscures grave risks for
him.
   Seepage through the embargo seems inevitable. Even if
Jordan's port of Aqaba is closed to Iraq, overland traffic is
likely to continue. Turkey may weaken in its pro-embargo
resolve if hunger mounts in Baghdad. Tehran could break the
embargo overtly, or at least wink at smugglers in Pakistan
and Afghanistan shipping through Iran to Iraq.

   Saddam Hussein courts moderate Arabs by saying he's ready
to negotiate Kuwait's fate, while he fans fundamentalist
fires. "There will be an inevitable consolidation of Arab
sentiment against the U.S.," warns ex-Pentagon hardliner
Frank Gaffney. But a Jordanian official contends any U.S.
effort to end the crisis quickly with military action would
unleash anti-American feelings.
   Bush's strong domestic support likely will erode if
American forces become bogged down by a lengthy stalemate.
                                                                                                       

   GREENSPAN SEEKS easier credit, but the Iraq crisis
complicates his job.
   The Fed chairman is worried by signs of a crumbling
economy, especially August's weak unemployment numbers and
mounting evidence of a credit crunch. But consumer price
figures add to inflation concerns. Fed Governor Wayne Angell
is disturbed by the surge in gold prices since Iraq invaded
Kuwait, and other officials fear easing now might send the
jittery bond market diving.
   Consensus may prove elusive when the Fed's policy-making
committee meets next week. Administration officials,
desperately eager to see interest rates fall, are dismayed by
the Fed's slowness to act. They regret failing to come up
with a strong replacement for Fed Vice Chairman Manuel
Johnson by now.
                                                                                                       

   BAILOUT WOES mount for savings and loan regulators.
   Short-term cleanup costs are still rising. Plans to pay
off high-interest notes that financed generous 1988
thrift-sales could add $15 billion to next year's projected
$100 billion bailout cost. The bailout agency even flounders
in its search for contractors to manage assets of failed
thrifts; winning bidders balk at terms they say would expose
them to lawsuits.
   A report next month on the 1988 deals will unleash a new
storm of criticism. Hearings by Rostenkowski and Metzenbaum,
and continuing ethics deliberations will keep the spotlight
on the S&amp;L mess. And some Republicans are trying to recruit
former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to head an
expected presidential commission to investigate the disaster.
   House Banking Committee Chairman Gonzalez plans to review
the role of Reagan administration officials -- including
former Treasury Secretary Regan.
                                                                                                       

   OUTBURSTS OF ETHICS overcome candidates. Returning
donations from tainted S&amp;Ls, Sen. Harkin gives $6,500 to the
Iowa treasury and Colorado Rep. Brown writes a $9,000 check
to the Resolution Trust Corp. With free congressional
mailings an issue, Pennsylvania Rep. Clinger cancels a mass
mailing costing $35,000.
                                                                                                       

   U.S. HOSTAGES in Lebanon become indirect captives of Iraqi
policy, U.S. officials fear. The U.S. stepped up contacts
with Iran last week to get the six released. But Baghdad's
overtures to Moslem fundamentalists and to Iran could harden
the kidnappers' attitude. A Beirut magazine predicted the
Americans will be freed, but Hezbollah said that "would be a
reward to the Americans for their invasion of the Gulf."
                                                                                                       

   NOT SO FAST: Sen. Humphrey, who said he'll run for the New
Hampshire state senate rather than re-election, riles fellow
Republicans by declaring he also aims to be senate president
as a stepping stone to governor. Though Humphrey is still a
favorite to win the September primary, GOP State Sen. Bill
Johnson warns that he "could very well lose the Republican
nomination."
                                                                                                       

   MICHIGAN MUD: The state's senate race turns nasty. GOP
challenger Schuette tries to link Sen. Levin to "cozy deals,"
the congressional pay raise and the S&amp;L scandal. The Levin
campaign accuses Schuette of "distortions and innuendo."
After winning nomination, Schuette challenges Levin to
debate; days earlier, the Republican refused to debate his
primary opponent.
                                                                                                       

   CREDIT CRACKDOWN? Bush administration eyes restrictions on
student loans.
   With defaults running $2 billion a year, officials are
discussing stiffer accreditation standards for schools --
especially privately run trade schools. Requiring closer
credit checks, linking loans to students' performance and
requiring lenders to share the cost if borrowers default also
are under review.
   Democrats will fight limits on student loans, particularly
in the face of sustained Republican cuts in education grants
for lower-income students. Michigan Rep. Ford, who will
become chairman of the House Education Committee next year,
wants to make the grant program an entitlement that can't be
cut.
   The brouhaha is likely to intensify interest in
controlling other federal loan-guarantees programs. The White
House has been pressing for "credit reform" in budget talks.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: One Washington wag calls Iraq's seizure of
Kuwaiti gold after the invasion "the standard leveraged
buy-out approach." . . . How's that? Iowa Sen. Harkin,
criticized by his GOP opponent for telling Catholics he's
"pro-life" and feminists he's "pro-choice," replies that he
actually is both. . . . Since the trial of Washington's mayor
began, a local store has been selling a product called
"Marionberry Jam."

   Toshiba Corp. of Japan will double production of laptop
personal computers at its West German unit by October, half a
year earlier than initially planned, to meet surging demand
in Europe, a company official said.
   Toshiba Europa G.m.b.H., the West German unit, began
producing 5,000 laptops a month at a new 25 million-mark
($15.9 million) factory in Regensburg, Bavaria, last April,
with plans for monthly production of 10,000 units within a
year, a target that was moved up six months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company is exporting from Japan that part of European
demand that can't be supplied locally.
   Toshiba holds a 38% share of the European laptop market.
It is producing three laptop computer models of its T-series,
compatible with International Business Corp. machines, with
plans to begin producing an additional model. It also is
considering producing book-type personal computers at the
West German facility.

   SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court here called off
the election for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors until the court reaches a decision on a Hispanic
voting rights suit in the nation's most populous county.
   By a 2-1 vote, the appeals panel stayed a ruling by U.S.
District Judge David V. Kenyon ordering a special primary
election using the new district lines, which are designed to
help elect a Hispanic to the county's five-member governing
board. Judge Kenyon ruled in June that the county
discriminated against Hispanics when redrawing district
boundaries after the 1980 census. On Aug. 3, the judge
rejected a redistricting plan drawn up by the county board
and then accepted one developed by civil-rights groups.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Both sides were frustrated with the latest decision.
Attorneys for Los Angeles County had argued that a November
runoff election from a June primary in the old district
boundaries should be allowed to go ahead until the appeal was
decided. A Hispanic group and the American Civil Liberties
Union wanted a new election to be held based on the map
accepted by Judge Kenyon.
   "Neither side has demonstrated that the equities strongly
favor going forward with their chosen election on November
6," wrote the appeals court judges. A full hearing is
scheduled for Oct. 1.

   U.S. Imported Over Half

   Imports accounted for more than half of the nation's oil
consumption in July for the third month in a row.
   An average of just under nine million barrels a day of
crude oil and petroleum products were imported last month,
the American Petroleum Institute reported, up 8.4% from the
same month last year. Foreign oil accounted for 51.3% of
total July deliveries; for the first seven months of the year
it averaged 50.0%. The API said the increase in part
reflected buying in advance of widely anticipated price
increases last month. This month, prices have risen even more
because of the Middle East crisis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nonetheless, the July figures are "a harbinger of the
future," said Charles DiBona, API president. He noted that
the recent string of 50%-plus import months have been coupled
with a continuing decline in domestic oil output. API said
domestic crude production last month dropped 5.3% to just
over seven million barrels a day compared with the year-ago
month.
   "The decline, which has persisted for more than four years
. . . has reduced domestic crude oil output by roughly two
million barrels a day or 20% since early 1986," the API said.

after his talk with King Hussein, who also acknowledged there
hadn't been any breakthrough. In Kuwait, Iraqi military

Americans and Britons in Kuwait should assemble at a hotel. A

   EL PASO, Texas -- Farah Inc. said that William F. Farah
and Charles C. Wood were removed by shareholders from the
company's board.
   The apparel maker said that 75% of the shares represented
in a shareholders' meeting last Friday, and 55% of all shares
outstanding, voted to remove the two men.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Farah started the proxy battle over the membership of
the board by demanding that the other seven of the company's
nine board members be ousted. The company countered with a
proposal that Mr. Farah and Mr. Wood be removed.
   The result marks the end of Mr. Farah's 53-year career at
the company founded by his parents. As reported in a page-one
story in The Wall Street Journal last week, Mr. Farah's
25-year reign as chief executive officer was tumultuous, as
the former chairman outlasted several potential successors
and survived an earlier ouster.
   A company statement said, "Now that this special
shareholders' meeting is behind us, management and the board
can look to the future and concentrate on returning the
company to profitability."
   Last week, the company projected it would report a
third-quarter loss in about two weeks. For the six months
ended April 30, Farah had a net loss of $2 million, or 32
cents a share, on sales of $59.9 million.

   Toronto-based Cineplex said earlier it may not be able to

appear unwilling to finance the transaction at the current
price.
   Cineplex said it is continuing negotiations with Plitt,
and didn't give a new deadline for closing the sale.

   Investigators also searched 17 locations yesterday in New

equipment and data storage devices. Five men, ranging in age
from 17 to 32, were arrested in the sweep and charged with
computer tampering and trespass, unauthorized entry and theft
of services. They were suspected of breaking into a computer
at the City University of Bellevue, Wash. Investigators said
the 14-year-old was also linked to the Bellevue intrusion.

said the Pentagon computer that was penetrated was part of an
administrative network and did not contain any classified
information. "There was no breach of national security," he
said.
   Investigators did not release the name of the 14-year-old,
who will be charged as a juvenile delinquent.

   Automatic Data Processing Inc. posted a 13% rise in
earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter, and projected a 10%
per-share earnings increase for fiscal 1991.
   In the quarter ended June 30, the computer services
company earned $59.7 million, or 81 cents a share, up from
$53 million, or 73 cents a share, a year ago. The growth was
fueled in part by a lower effective tax rate. Fourth-quarter
revenue was $425.8 million, up from $418.1 million last year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the fiscal year, earnings were up 13% to $211.7
million, or $2.88 a share. Revenue was up 2% to $1.71
billion.
   The company predicted only "modest" fiscal 1991 revenue
growth, in part because in the recent fiscal year it sold its
manufacturing and banking information services and Canadian
brokerage quotation services, as well as 81% of its Brazilian
business.
   The company said that capital spending would remain at
about $100 million in fiscal 1991.

   NEW YORK -- The Actors Equity union will permit a white
actor to play a Vietnamese man of mixed race in a Broadway
production of the hit London musical "Miss Saigon." The vote
by the executive council reverses a stand it took on behalf
of the union's members of color last week.
   In June, the union's committee on racial equality asked
producer Cameron Mackintosh to consider auditioning Asian
actors here for the starring role created in London by
Jonathan Pryce. Mr. Mackintosh refused. Last week union
leaders voted to deny Mr. Pryce permission to play the role.
Mr. Mackintosh canceled the show the next day.

<TEXT>
   "Miss Saigon," about the American withdrawal from Vietnam
in 1975, had a record New York advance ticket sale of $25
million.
   The original union stand put a national spotlight on an
Asian-American civil rights issue. But the position was
quickly assailed by arguments over economic consequences,
artistic freedom and racial equality.
   Tisa Chang, director of the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre
here, said Asian-Americans are offended by the physical
posturing and makeup Mr. Pryce uses to portray an Asian. Ms.
Chang vowed to continue to fight "yellow-face" portrayals of
Asian characters.

   Cie. Generale des Etablissements Michelin of France
reported that its first-half consolidated revenue fell 4% to
27.37 billion francs ($5.21 billion) from 28.47 billion
francs a year earlier.
   The tire and rubber concern, which announced the results
in a mandatory legal filing, declined to provide additional
details or comparable first-half profit data. For all of
1989, Michelin had consolidated profit of 2.45 billion
francs, after payments to minority interests, on revenue of
55.26 billion francs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The first-half sales decline came as little surprise to
the markets, as analysts had anticipated weaker 1990 results
in the wake of price-cutting by major manufacturers in the
sector, in an effort to protect market share.
   Michelin executives in June told shareholders that the
company is likely to face three or four difficult years soon,
because of tight market conditions and plans for heavy
investment outlays. The executives also declined to rule out
the possibility of losses in the years ahead, and unveiled
previously reported job cuts aimed at holding down costs.

   MONTREAL -- Canada's main East-West railroad lines were
blocked by two groups of Indians in northern Ontario, halting
freight and passenger traffic between Toronto and Winnipeg,
Manitoba.
   Taking their cue from Mohawk Indians near Montreal who
have blocked a bridge into the city for the past six weeks,
the Indians are seeking provincial and federal government
action on land claims and other issues, government officials
said. Leaders of the Indian groups couldn't be reached for
comment.

   CP Rail, a unit of Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd.,
said the line was blocked at about noon yesterday at Mobert,
Ontario, by Indians from a reservation there.
   CP Rail spokesman Paul Thurston said the railroad is
studying ways to reroute rail traffic.
   Another blockade began Monday when Indians at Long Lac,
Ontario, blocked government-owned Canadian National Railways'
main East-West lines.
   Indian and Native Affairs Minister Thomas Siddon said the
federal government won't negotiate land claims with the
Indians as long as the blockades remain in place.
   Industry officials said the two railroads carry about 20%
to 30% of East-West traffic in Canada, with bulk commodities
accounting for most of the railroads' business.

shareholders," said Thomas Thompson, president of Quest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the proposal, Quest would give Titan shareholders
about 9.9 million newly issued shares, which would give Titan
holders about 63.5% of Quest's common stock. In return, Quest
would absorb all 120,750 Titan common shares, which Titan
says have an unaudited book value of $236 a share, or about
$28.5 million.
   Titan wants to go public and its managers believe they can
use Quest's "unutilized capital resources" better than
Quest's management has, said Michael Bodayle, chief financial
officer of Titan. Mr. Bodayle said Titan executives have met
with Mr. Thompson and believe that Quest hasn't seriously
considered Titan's offer.
   Mr. Thompson said Quest still holds about $10 million
following the sale of a division and is looking for an
acquisition in the health-care manufacturing industry.

   Dollar Hits Record Low Against Mark
   In Panic Selling, Then Rises Marginally

   NEW YORK -- The dollar fell to another record low against
the mark yesterday before rising slightly above that level.
   The sharp drop, following the currency's strong rally off
its previous low against the mark Wednesday, surprised
currency watchers, who had thought the session would provide
some stability. But an overwhelming crush of bad news for the
U.S. economy won the day over renewed rumblings from the
Persian Gulf.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A rush of panic selling just after lunch in New York
pushed the dollar below 1.56 marks, a level that had provided
support in European and Asian trading.
   The greenback then stabilized but never rose above that
rate. Toward the end of the day, the U.S. currency set a
record low of 1.5515 marks -- beating its previous low of
1.5525 marks early Wednesday.
   However, the dollar rose marginally later, to be quoted
late in the day at 1.5525 marks, compared with 1.5660 marks
late Wednesday.
   Traders suggested that, as the dollar drifted lower, many
currency dealers who were long, or overbought, on the dollar
had seen their positions eroded and were forced to sell.
Other participants -- mostly dollar bears anyway -- joined
the crowd.
   "The market got caught slightly long dollar," said Baruch
Deutsch, a Lehman Bros. dealer.
   Price swings were exaggerated by spare activity. A summer
market was further thinned out this week by holidays in Japan
and Europe. Some banks, meanwhile, were still closed by the
power outage that hit lower Manhattan Monday.
   Dealers were given plenty of excuses to sell dollars.
   Already concerned by reports of problem loans at Bankers
Trust and Chemical Bank, dealers were greeted yesterday by a
story in this newspaper saying that developer Donald Trump
could have a negative net worth of as much as $294 million.
Mr. Trump had come to symbolize the nation's go-go 1980s.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. reported that housing starts shrank
for the sixth consecutive month in July, marking the longest
string of monthly declines since 1981.
   In the day's other economic release, U.S. consumer prices
were reported to have risen 0.4% in July, despite a fall in
energy prices that month.
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.2915 Swiss francs, down from 1.3065 francs late Wednesday.
The U.S. currency was changing hands at 147.25 yen, down from
147.65 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was trading at $1.9090,
up from $1.9006.
   In Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading soon after the
opening at 147.8 yen, down a bit from Thursday's Tokyo close
of 147.90 yen. Meanwhile the U.S. currency was trading at
about 1.540 marks; in Tokyo Thursday, it closed at .5660
marks.
   Lost amid the U.S. economic gloom was more bad news in the
Middle East. The much-awaited meeting between President
George Bush and Jordan's King Hussein failed to unveil a
peace plan. Instead, Gulf news yesterday was dominated by an
acceleration in the U.S. military buildup on the Saudi
Arabia-Kuwait frontier and an Iraqi order for all U.S. and
U.K. citizens trapped in Kuwait to gather in a hotel, raising
the possibility of their becoming hostages.
   Meanwhile, an Iraqi spokesman read an open letter from
Saddam Hussein in which the Iraqi dictator told Mr. Bush:
"You will receive American bodies back in bags."
   The dollar is caught in a "constant tug of war," said
Robert White, corporate foreign exchange manager for First
Interstate Bank of California in Los Angeles. "There is
little question where the dollar should go: It should go
down. But when you intersperse with that comments from Saddam
about body bags, it gets support."
   Mr. White said the long-dollar positions, whose unwinding
began the dollar's decline, were created in reaction to
Iraq's hostile message.
   The dollar ended European dealings nominally higher,
although the greenback traded narrowly and sometimes
choppily.
   London traders said short covering in the European
afternoon helped bring the dollar off its lowest levels and
back to its intraday highs. Against the yen, the U.S. unit
climbed on the back of strengthening spot oil prices.
   Activity in the European Monetary System centered on
mark-lira trading. Although there were no signs of central
bank intervention, the mark rose sharply in hectic and
nervous trading during the European morning. The lira also
lost ground against the French franc as the mark-franc cross
rate remained unchanged.
   Milan traders said German banks started the rally, which
pushed the mark to 735.30 lire, up from 734.20 lire at the
start of the European business day and up from 734.65 lire at
the Milan fixing Tuesday. There was no fixing Wednesday
because of a holiday.
   The dollar finished higher in thin trading yesterday in
Tokyo after news of cuts in Saudi Arabian oil shipments took
the steam out of the yen. The U.S. currency closed at 147.90
yen, compared with its Wednesday close of 147.85 yen.
   Dealings focused almost exclusively on dollar-yen rates.
Tokyo participants were nervous about trying to push the
dollar lower against the mark or other European currencies
after the record low set Wednesday.
   News published at mid-morning that Saudi Arabia would trim
crude oil shipments to Japan in September cut short the yen's
early rally and spurred dollar buying, dealers said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $409.20 an ounce, up $6.60. Estimated
volume was a heavy five million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$414 an ounce.

   Rights Group to Kick Harder at Sneaker Firm's Policies

   A Chicago-based civil rights group is planning a tougher
game of one-on-one against sneaker-maker Nike Inc.
   Next week, Operation PUSH -- founded by Jesse Jackson
among others -- intends to expand a nationwide campaign to
get the world's largest athletic shoe maker to invest more in
the black community, where Nike sells tens of millions of
dollars of sneakers every year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the end of July, Operation PUSH issued a call for
blacks to boycott the Beaverton, Ore., company; this Monday,
the group plans a series of demonstrations around Nike
corporate headquarters. Among its demands: that Nike name a
black to its board and start doing business with black-owned
banks and advertising agencies.
   "All we're saying is that if Nike re-invests in the
African-American community and does business with us, it
makes good sense and contributes to the financial well-being
of the black community," said the Rev. Tyrone Crider,
executive director of PUSH.
   The group eventually hopes to obtain "moral covenants"
from all U.S. athletic shoe makers. With one of the biggest
shares of the U.S. athletic shoe market, Nike was the logical
place to start, Mr. Crider said.
   Nike says it already contributes plenty to blacks.
   "We are responding to inquiries, and we plan to make
people aware of the things we've done. We do just do it. We
do the things that we think are part of our responsibility as
citizens," said Richard Donahue, president and chief
operating officer.
   Mr. Donahue cited a special store that the company
operates in predominantly black northeast Portland, Ore.,
where profits are split with the community. In the same area
of the city, Nike has sponsored a program to teach young
blacks carpentry skills, a program that has resulted in the
restoration of homes that were either abandoned or used as
havens for drug sales. Most of Nike's estimated $10 million
annual charitable contribution budget goes to minority
programs, he said.
   But PUSH officials contend those amounts pale in
comparison with what the company takes in. Nike estimates
that about 15% of its $2.4 billion in annual revenue comes
from blacks -- and PUSH contends the figure is closer to 30%.
   Boycotts of national corporations are nothing new for
Operation PUSH. In 1980, the group led a 40-day boycott of
Coca-Cola Co. that led to a $30 million agreement to purchase
products and services from black businesses. Kentucky Fried
Chicken signed a "moral covenant" with the group in 1982.
Even though the pact has officially expired, according to a
company spokesman, the concern still works to provide
minority business opportunities in the construction of new
restaurants.
   That also means the stakes in the dispute could be high
for Nike. An effective boycott "could hurt Nike," said Stan
Lanzet, an analyst with Arnold &amp; S. Bleichroeder. "You don't
want to get caught in a controversy about what they are or
aren't doing, and get crucified in the marketplace in the
meantime," he added.
   So far, Nike is denying the group's allegations. Mr.
Donahue says that Portland's black community refuses to
support the boycott. The company's prominent black spokesmen
from the athletic world, including football and baseball
player Bo Jackson and basketball superstar Michael Jordan,
have also declined to support the idea, according to Mr.
Donahue.
   Neither Mr. Jackson nor Mr. Jordan could be reached for
comment.
   Amitai Etzioni, a sociology professor at George Washington
University and the author of book called "The Moral
Dimension," about corporate responsibility and ethics, said
the two groups would have to compromise.
   "Nike is surely right that they have to do business and
they're not a welfare agency, and I'm sure they do contribute
to the community somehow," said Mr. Etzioni. "It is also true
that the minority community has a right to get some of its
money returned to them."
   Any compromise, however, could be off to a bad start.
Already Operation PUSH has accused Nike of initiating a
"national smear campaign" with the response letter it sent to
the organization and simultaneously to newspapers across the
country. The letter accused the organization of launching a
"pre-emptive strike" against the company after Nike's main
competitor, Reebok International Ltd., paid for an ad in
PUSH's magazine.

   With some justification, the scientific community laments
that U.S. basic research grants haven't kept pace with the
state of inquiry, such that whereas 20 years ago most
applications were accepted, nowadays less than a fifth are
funded. Before you think that science has no political
constituency, consider the success of senator Mark Hatfield
(R., Ore.) in using his powerful Appropriations Committee
seat to rack up construction money for the Oregon Health
Sciences University. With the latest $12.5 million catch for
a Neurosensory Research Center this month, the Oregonian
newspaper reports, Mr. Hatfield has now funneled $91 million
into bricks and mortar for the 1,300-student school over the
last decade -- more than for any other campus in the country.
Scientists might well conclude that Congress's main interest
is not really research, but ribbon cuttings.

   NEW YORK -- The bond market was knocked down with a
one-two punch yesterday, staggering first on news of rising
inflation then tumbling after a menacing speech by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond, which plunged nearly two
points during the day, rebounded slightly to end 1 5/8 points
lower. The decline translates into a loss of $16.25 for a
bond with a $1,000 face amount.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Top-quality corporate bonds followed Treasurys' lead,
tumbling as much as 1 1/4 points. But municipal,
mortgage-backed and junk bonds posted smaller declines, with
prices ending between 1/2 and 5/8 point lower.
   As prices deteriorated, the yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond jumped to 8.92%, the highest closing
yield on a benchmark bond since May 3, when the yield was
8.98%.
   Although institutional investors are bailing out of bonds,
analysts say that yields are approaching levels that
individual investors should consider attractive.
   "You have a fragile stock market and bond yields that are
close to 9%. That's a combination that has always attracted
small investors to the bond market," said F. Ward McCarthy, a
managing director at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates.
But buying on the part of small investors alone isn't enough
to reverse the deeply bearish sentiment in the market.
   Yesterday's sell-off began as soon as the market opened
and was triggered by a larger-than-expected rise in the
consumer price index, a measure of inflation. The Department
of Labor reported that the CPI rose 0.4% in July. During the
first seven months of the year, the department said the CPI
was running at an annual rate of 5.8%. With oil prices now
rising, some economists believe that 1990 could produce the
highest inflation rate in nearly a decade.
   "The core inflation rate is getting worse. This is very
alarming," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon
Bank Corp.
   The CPI report was a disappointment because it reduces the
chances that the Federal Reserve will soon cut short-term
interest rates. Economists generally believe that reducing
interest rates at a time when prices are rising tends to
exacerbate inflation. To avoid that, economists believe the
Fed may vote to keep credit policy unchanged at its next
Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which is scheduled to
take place next week.
   "It will be very hard for the Fed to ease interest rates
at this time," said Mr. Robertson. "In fact, the Fed may not
ease unless or until there is clear evidence that we are in a
recession," he said. In recent weeks, the value of short-term
Treasury securities has appreciated due to expectations that
the Fed would ease. But, short-term securities were the
hardest hit in yesterday's early rout.
   After the heavy round of CPI-related selling, the market
quieted for a time.
   But comments by Mr. Hussein clobbered the market again. In
an open letter to President Bush, which was broadcast by
Iraqi television and picked up by Cable News Network, the
Iraqi strongman said President Bush was a "liar" who was
trying to humiliate the Arab world by using military force in
Saudi Arabia.
   Saddam Hussein also threatened to battle Americans troops,
saying that "you will receive American bodies back in bags."
   Those ominous words shook up investors. "The part about
sending Americans home in bags raised the prospect of war and
right away people reached the conclusion that oil prices will
rise," putting even more pressure on inflation, said James
Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government
Securities Inc. Inflation is the bane of the bond market
because it reduces the value of fixed-income investments.
   Mr. Capra said that investors also fear that a war in the
Middle East could disrupt the budget deficit-cutting process,
which had been one of the few positive factors in the bond
market.
   Although yesterday's morning decline reflected heavy
selling, Mr. Capra said that prices fell in the afternoon
largely because dealers were cutting prices.
   "The market is trying to reprice itself," he said. After
Saddam Hussein's speech, "market participants reached a
collective consensus that these prices are too high and
yields are too low for this environment. We are seeking
levels where we can attract interest."
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 98 2/32,
down from 99 25/32 on Wednesday. The issue's yield, which
moves in the opposite direction of its price, jumped to 8.92%
from 8.76%. The latest 10year notes ended at 99 22/32 to
yield 8.78% compared with 100 21/32 to yield 8.63% on
Wednesday. Two-year notes ended at 99 26/32 to yield 8.08%
compared with 100 3/ 32 to yield 7.93%.
   Short-term rates were sharply higher yesterday. The
discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.50%
for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.73% while the rate on
six-month bills ended at a rate of 7.47% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.85%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate, Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Investment-grade corporate bonds ended as much as 1 1/4
point lower yesterday while junk bonds, high-yield
speculative-grade securities, ended with losses of about 1/2
point.
   The biggest loser in the junk-bond market yesterday was
AmBase Corp., which tumbled on concerns that the company's
sale of its troubled Home Insurance Co. unit could be
blocked.
   Although AmBase's 14.875% senior subordinated notes
rebounded slightly by the close, the debt securities still
finished 13 3/4 points lower at 81 3/4 on moderate volume of
$3.1 million of bonds.
   Fears that the Home Insurance sale might be derailed were
fueled by Shearson Lehman equity analyst Udayan Ghose, who
told traders in a morning call that the deal could be stymied
by regulators or disgruntled shareholders.
   "It seems to me that shareholders are unlikely to favor
the deal given what has happened to the stock," Mr. Ghose
told Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.
   AmBase, which had promised a special dividend to its
shareholders, said it is unlikely to make any payout based on
the expected proceeds from the sale.
   Thursday's sharp declines in AmBase bonds come after the
securities rose by a total of two points Tuesday and
Wednesday on news that the company signed a letter of intent
to sell its troubled Home Insurance Co. unit to Vik Brothers
International, a European-based investor group, for $544
million.
   The junk-bond market welcomed the asset sale because the
company said it would use proceeds from the transaction to
help pay off debt. Jack Plaxe, chief financial officer of
AmBase, said the company would not have "done this deal had
we not thought we could pay our debt." Mr. Plaxe also said he
believes the sale will meet with required regulatory
approval.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds followed the Treasury market with
municipal issues ending as much as 5/8 point lower.
   In competitive action, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
group priced $100 million Metropolitan Seattle, Washington,
municipality sewer revenue bonds to yield from 6.00% in 1993
to 7.45% in 2030.
   Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% of 2018 were 3/8 point lower at 98 3/8 to
yield 7.32%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Prices of mortgage-backed securities ended lower.
Higher-coupon mortgage securities posted smaller declines
than the low-coupon issues, reflecting yesterday's news that
housing starts in July fell 2.6% and that building permits,
an indicator of future housing activity, fell 2.6%.
   "That's why the high coupons are doing better," said a New
York mortgage-backed securities trader. "To the extent that
there's less housing, there are fewer people moving, and
lower prepayments," which favor the high-coupon issues.
   Among actively traded secondary issues, Government
National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues for August delivery
were down 17/32 on the day at 98 25/32. Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were down 20/32 at 98 10/32,
and Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues were
down 20/32 at 98 27/32.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Fears that oil prices may start to rise again undermined
global bond markets again yesterday. Although the U.S. market
took the biggest hits yesterday, prices also were lower in
Japan, Britain, West Germany, France and several other
countries.
   In Britain, domestic economic data along with the
prospects of higher oil hurt bond prices. The government
reported that Britain's underlying annual rate of growth in
average earnings rose to 10% in June from 9.75% in May. The
trend suggests that wage inflation may continue to rise
despite a firm pound and tight monetary policy, analysts say.
In response, Britain's benchmark 11.75% bond due 2003/2007
rose 3/8 point to 98 30/32 to yield 11.89%.
   West German bonds ended about 1/4 point lower while in
Japan the yield on the benchmark No. 119 10-year bond rose to
7.92%. The price for the No. 119 fell 0.50 point to 83.52.
   (Foreign bond yields are quoted here in local terms and
therefore differ from yields calculated for these markets by
U.S. investment firms, which use a semiannual compound
measure to compare yields across markets. When calculated
using that semiannual measure, the yield on the No. 119 bond
closed at 7.36%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)

   A federal judge in Arizona approved a plan that allocates
money paid in the settlement of litigation stemming from
Washington Public Power Supply System's $2.25 billion bond
default in 1983.
   U.S. District Judge William Browning of Tucson approved an
allocation plan proposed by New York-based Chemical Bank and
plaintiffs' lawyers earlier this year. According to the plan,
$93.5 million will be put into a fund to be distributed by
Chemical Bank to all bondholders. The rest will be used for
attorney's fees and reimbursement of litigation expenses and
then distributed to plaintiffs who bought bonds before June
1983.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Plaintiffs who bought WPPSS bonds before June 1983 and
Chemical Bank, a unit of Chemical Banking Corp. and trustee
for the estimated 24,000 bondholders, reached approximately
$700 million in settlements with the defendants last year.
The defendants include WPPSS, several utilities in six states
in the Northwest, the Bonneville Power Administration, the
state of Washington and various professional firms.
   Bondholders will be reimbursed based on their reported
losses and proportions will vary depending on when they
purchased the bonds. Actual losses will be reduced in many
cases by a deemed "salvage" value of 22 cents on the dollar
assigned to the bonds. The approved plan, which included
speculators who bought after the default, appears to offer
current holders at least nine cents on the dollar.

   NEW YORK -- A shareholder filed suit, charging AmBase
Corp. with disseminating false information about a special
dividend to inflate its stock price in recent weeks.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, seeks
class-action status. The suit claims that investors were
misled from May 14 until Tuesday, when the company announced
details of an agreement to sell its Home Insurance Co. unit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On May 14, AmBase said that it was suspending its
quarterly common stock dividend but that it expected to pay a
special dividend to shareholders when it closed the sale of
Home Insurance. But Tuesday, when AmBase announced the sale
of Home Insurance to Vik Brothers International, it also said
it no longer expects to pay the special dividend.
   AmBase, a financial-services company, said this week that
it will use proceeds from the $544 million sale of Home
Insurance to help pay down debt.
   The lawsuit claims that AmBase should have disclosed
earlier that it wouldn't be able to pay the special dividend.
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of all shareholders who bought
stock between May 14 and Tuesday, claims that AmBase kept the
information secret to entice investors. The lawsuit seeks
unspecified damages.
   A company spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Ambase shares fell 87.5 cents to $1.875. On Wednesday, the
stock plummeted $4.75 to close at $2.75.

   LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J. -- Members of the New Jersey Casino
Control Commission hinted they would need more time to
evaluate Donald J. Trump's $65 million bank bailout plan, but
a lawyer for the developer pressed for a speedy decision on
the matter.
   Meanwhile Mr. Trump has rehired Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., his
longtime accounting firm, to work on the casino matter,
according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Mr.
Trump terminated his relationship with the firm in June
because of complaints from bankers about Andersen's
monitoring of Mr. Trump's business affairs. The Trump
Organization said yesterday that Andersen was rehired because
it has more expertise in the casino business than Kenneth
Levanthal &amp; Co., which will continue to oversee the Trump
bailout.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The gaming commission had scheduled meetings for yesterday
and today to approve the bank bailout, but two commissioners
suggested they might need an additional week to evaluate the
thousands of pages of documents related to the new financing.
   Thomas Cerabino, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, testified that
any delay would cause the banks to pull out of the bailout
proposal.
   The commission's approval of the bailout, which is needed
because of Mr. Trump's casino holdings, is the last step in
the restructuring of Trump Organization.
   New details of the bank agreement emerged during the
hearing, which was attended by Mr. Trump. Mr. Cerabino, of
the New York law firm Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher, said the
accord, which would suspend about $850 million in interest
payments in exchange for collateral in Trump properties,
offers powerful incentives for Mr. Trump to sell assets as
quickly as possible. He referred to documents showing that
money generated from asset sales before June 30, 1991, would
retire interest payments at a rate of $5 for every $1
generated. Cash generated from assets sold between June 30,
1991, and June 30, 1992, could retire interest at a rate of
$2 for every $1 generated. The ratio continues to diminish
over time.
   Mr. Cerabino also said that a personal bankruptcy filing
by Mr. Trump would automatically trigger a default of the
loan agreement, but a default on a single asset wouldn't
necessarily trigger a default on the whole bank agreement. In
this way, Mr. Cerabino said, the total bailout plan is
insulated from the failure of a single asset.
   On Wednesday, the commission released documents showing
that on a short-term liquidation basis, Mr. Trump could have
anywhere from a negative net worth of $294 million to a net
worth of $281 million. As a "going concern," the report said,
Mr. Trump's assets would be valued at between $479 million
and $759 million.
   The New Jersey division of Gaming Enforcement, which is
part of the state attorney general's office, hinted in a
report yesterday that it would recommend to the commission
that it approve the bailout. "It may very well be that the
greatest hope for preserving remaining value {in the Trump
empire}, lies in a quick and efficient reorganization and
work-out process -- a privatized bankruptcy of sort --
outside the courtroom," the report stated.
   Another Trump lawyer, Nick Ribis, said the plan would
present Mr. Trump with "a realistic opportunity to solve
these problems on an ongoing basis."

   Drought-Stricken Santa Barbara Turns
   To Desalination of Pacific Ocean Water

   The drought-stricken city of Santa Barbara, Calif., is
turning to the Pacific Ocean to help satisfy the thirst of
its parched residents.
   Santa Barbara, a coastal city of roughly 80,000 people
about 100 miles north of Los Angeles, agreed Tuesday to a
five-year contract with Ionics Inc. The deal calls for the
Watertown, Mass., company to build a desalination plant and
sell water produced by it to the city. The plant could supply
as much as a third of the city's water.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Water experts hailed Santa Barbara's decision as an
important spur to desalination, which generally is considered
too expensive and technically dicey to satisfy the
drinking-water needs of most cities. Desalination produces
drinking water by removing salt from sea water through a
filtration process called reverse osmosis. The process is
relatively expensive because it uses much electricity.
   "This certainly lends credibility to the effort," said
Lori Griggs, executive director for the Committee for Water
Policy, a lobbying group in San Francisco. "It will light a
fire that should prompt improvements in the technology."
   The city's decision also is a boost for Ionics, which
seeks to harvest a potentially huge market for desalinated
water in the parched West. Mainly, Ionics sells its
desalination plants and services to remote islands, or
communities in Florida that need to desalt brackish
groundwater. The company earned $3.6 million on sales of $109
million in 1989.
   "This gives Ionics a chance to prove their technology in
California coastal waters," said David Landecker, a Santa
Barbara City Council member. Mr. Landecker said Santa Barbara
still must decide how large a plant it wants Ionics to build.
The options under consideration would cost from $23 million
to $55 million and result in increases to city water bills of
anywhere from 42% to 67%.
   Rather than seeking to pioneer the process, Santa Barbara
is opting for desalination "out of desperation," Mr.
Landecker said. "We need water."
   A six-year drought has left this coastal city and its
environs drier than at anytime since the late 1860s. The city
and surrounding communities have imposed strict rationing
plans on residents. To make matters worse, the area isn't
part of the state's huge water-supply project. Its sole large
reservoir is at its lowest level ever and projected to go dry
in a year should the area suffer another winter of
below-normal rainfall.
   Ionics insists it can help Santa Barbara, a popular
tourist destination, stave off disaster. Desalination "is
practically viable and is looking more attractive as
alternatives, such as bringing in water from northern
California, are getting more expensive," said Arthur L.
Goldstein, Ionics's chairman. Already, several other water
agencies in California are studying a move to desalination.
In July, the giant Metropolitan Water District, which
provides more than half of the water used by 15 million
Southern Californians, began planning a demonstration
desalination plant.
   Next month, Marin County, which relies exclusively on
local wells and reservoirs, will begin testing drinking water
from an experimental plant designed to purify water from
nearby San Francisco Bay. Marin considers desalination "a
long-term water supply," but isn't likely to reap drinking
water from the bay before 1995, said Ronald Johnson, general
manager of the Marin Municipal Water District.
   Though California communities are scrambling for new water
sources to meet their growing populations and ward off
worries about a lengthening drought, basic economics could
well delay the acceptance of desalination. Desalination
remains a far costlier way to obtain water than traditional
sources, which cost roughly ten times less.
   "Technically, its not hard to do" said Ian Watson, a
desalination expert in Fort Myers, Fla. "But the economics of
sea-water conversion have to be dealt with. It's going to
cost more to make {drinking} water out of the ocean than
Californians have been used to paying."
   Even Santa Barbara is reluctant to describe its commitment
to desalination as anything more than an emergency measure.
"We're looking at this as a temporary supply," said Mayor
Sheila Lodge.

   LOS ANGELES -- Leonard Green &amp; Partners said it agreed to
buy Carr-Gottstein Inc., Alaska's largest food-and-drug
retailer and wholesaler, for about $300 million.
   This is the first acquisition by Leonard Green &amp; Partners,
a merchant banking firm specializing in leveraged buy-outs
that was founded late last year by Leonard Green, formerly a
partner of New York-based Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen Ltd.
Leveraged buy-out activity in general has dropped since last
year's collapse of the junk-bond market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman for Leonard Green &amp; Partners said the
acquisition of Carr-Gottenstein, which should be completed in
the fall, wouldn't involve junk bonds. She wouldn't elaborate
on the nature of the financing.
   Mr. Green, who was credited with much of the success that
Gibbons, Green had with arranging LBOs in the 1980s, said he
left that firm because of "philosophical differences" with
his partners. Since setting up his own shop, he has been
struggling to match his prior track record; he has said his
goal is to complete between six and nine buy-outs, valued at
$100 million to $500 million each, in the next three years.
   Carr-Gottstein includes Carr's food and drug stores, the
J.B. Gottstein Co. wholesaling operation, the Oaken Keg
liquor stores, several shopping centers in Anchorage, Eagle
River, and Fairbanks and several other distribution-related
concerns.
   The acquisition provides for new stores and remodeling of
existing stores. Carr's General Manager John Cairns and its
vice president of operations, Mark Williams, will retain
their management positions, Leonard Green &amp; Partners said.

   N.V. Philips Trims Plans
   For Its 100th Anniversary
   As Cost Savings Measure

   EINDHOVEN, The Netherlands -- Faced with plunging profits
in the first half of 1990 and an expected loss of 2 billion
guilders ($1.13 billion) for the year, N.V. Philips said it
has extensively cut back on lavish plans for the troubled
Dutch electronics giant's 100th anniversary celebration in
1991.
   Rather, Philips spokesman Jan van Schagen said the company
now plans to "commemorate the centenary in an unostentatious
and modest manner."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although plans hadn't yet been finalized, at one time they
included a street carnival in Eindhoven as well as two major
company exhibits, Mr. Van Schagen said.
   "Those are definitely off," said Mr. Van Schagen. "We feel
the situation in which we now are and the way we celebrate
these festivities ought to be in some proportion."
   Originally, Philips had been planning to spend "tens of
millions" of guilders on the anniversary, Mr. Van Schagen
said but added he had no estimate for the costs of the
currently planned celebrations.
   On Aug. 9, Philips reported that its net income from
ordinary activities plummeted to 43 million guilders in the
first half of 1990 from 420 million guilders in the
year-earlier period. Including extraordinary items, Philips
had a total net income of 373 million guilders in the first
half of 1990 compared with 458 million guilders in the first
half of 1989.
   Philips is maintaining an earlier forecast that it will
have to spend 2.7 billion guilders on restructuring efforts
and lay off close to 10,000 workers, mostly in its Western
European operations. The restructuring charge will result in
a loss of about 2 billion guilders for the year, according to
Philips' forecast.

   Your July 25 page-one article about the soft home-sale
market, which discussed the need for a family in Rye, N.Y.,
to lower their asking price for today's market, did not
mention the tremendous appreciation they will realize from
the eventual sale of their home.
   The Schenkers purchased their home in 1976 for $107,000,
and if they sell it in 1990 for $895,000 (their current
asking price lowered from $1.5 million), they will realize an
836% increase over the 1976 selling price. The $788,000
profit amounts to $56,200 return a year, or a 52.6% annual
increase. This average annual appreciation is higher than
most annual household incomes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although the Schenkers are experiencing the effects of a
challenging market, they are not taking a loss. In fact, the
appreciation they will eventually see is an immense increase
over the 1976 selling price.

   Your article made me want to crawl under my desk. Moments
before my Journal arrived, I was on the phone with my wife
attempting to walk her through the fun job of draining the
water bed. Two days ago, it was something else, and now she
tells me my microwave is spitting up blood in its own
electronic throes of death.
   You see, I am in Kentucky -- in our new hometown, and she
is in Massachusetts -- in our still-up-for-sale house. It
long since passed from Home to House, and if this saga
continues much longer, it will be called things you don't
even hear on TV.
   The dream job offer was followed by the full-of-smiles
visit where my wife and I found the perfect vacant lot and
the blueprints that could be changed here and there. Once
back in Massachusetts we found the world's greatest broker,
who could sell igloos in Arizona. We are now on our second
broker.
   One of my aunts, a retired nun, prays for us. My other
aunt and my lovely mother-in-law pray for us. I can't go on
with this letter, as my knuckles are turning white.
   Perhaps, somewhere in this wide world, someone wants my
house on Cape Cod. Sadly, I somehow think the waves at
Wellfleet will be lapping against the Journal's own printing
presses in Chicopee before we find a buyer.

   I am a native of the Northeast, but I have lived in Texas
for nearly 10 years. I've enjoyed the energy boom and then
suffered through the economic downturn and real-estate
collapse along with everyone else in the Southwest. In
particular, I experienced double-digit home-price increases
only to subsequently see the value of my home fall by half.
Given this, it is very difficult for me to have much sympathy
for those individuals such as Frederick and Joyce Schenker
who tried to sell their home for $1.5 million, after having
purchased it in the 1970s for little more than $100,000. Get
real] Greed stopped being fashionable when Ron and Nancy
returned to California.
   As a baby-boomer, I grew up with ever-expanding
expectations. I have learned a very sobering lesson, and I
now realize that if there is to be anything left of this
country to pass on to my children and their generation, then
we as a society must return to the virtues of my
grandparents' generation -- thrift, practicality and
moderation.

   When my home was put up for sale in July 1989, the Realtor
determined the listing price; my suggested price having been
dismissed as too low for consideration. Ten months later it
sold; but only after numerous price reductions and one
kitchen remodeling, all done on my initiative. When I
questioned why the sales price was far below the listing
price, I was sternly told that the original price was
unrealistic. Foolish me.
   Your characterization of Realtors as the reasonable voice
against unrealistic expectations of homeowners can only be
explained by your having gotten your information from
Realtors. Foolish you.

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)
</GV>
<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Governor John LaWare
said that the Fed's new capital requirements for banks
probably won't be proposed until early next year.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said in congressional
testimony last month that the Fed believes higher capital
requirements are needed to deter unusually risky lending by
banks. In a disclosure that surprised the markets and the
banking world, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed was working on
proposals that would increase the capital requirements for
banks above the levels set recently in an international
accord called the Basel agreement.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Mr. LaWare said in an interview that the new capital
proposals wouldn't be issued anytime soon, partly because the
Fed is concerned about the current market for bank security
issues, which would be used to raise capital. "We are aware
that the markets are so wretched for bank securities now that
it does no good to mandate something attainable by the
industry only at an unacceptable cost," the Fed governor
said.
   In addition, Mr. LaWare said, the Fed wants to see what
proposals for revision of the deposit insurance system and
banking structure are made by the Treasury in its study due
at the end of the year. The Fed's capital proposal would
naturally have to take into account any changes called for by
the Treasury, Mr. LaWare said.
   In particular, Mr. LaWare said he expects the Fed's
capital proposal would be coupled with a proposal allowing
regulators to take certain actions against a bank as the
bank's capital dwindled, and perhaps to take control of
institutions before capital was completely exhausted. Many
experts argue that such an approach would save the government
big sums in bank bailouts, but legal experts question whether
it would be an unconstitutional taking of property. "I think
they'd be part of a package," Mr. LaWare said, referring to
the capital and "early intervention" proposals.
   Mr. LaWare wouldn't discuss interest rates, in keeping
with the Fed's policy of not commenting on them within two
weeks of a meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee, which
determines monetary policy. The committee meets next Tuesday.
But Mr. LaWare did say there were continued signs of a credit
crunch, in which banks were restricting lending beyond the
point the Fed would like to see.
   "It's hard to see it in the macroeconomic data. But the
anecdotal evidence is increasingly strident and persuasive,"
he said. Last month, after Chairman Greenspan said for first
time that banks had restricted their lending a bit too much,
the Fed pushed down the Fed funds rate from to 8% from 8
1/4%.
   Mr. LaWare said he expects that credit from banks could
remain tight in the foreseeable future, as banks continue to
"downsize" to raise their capital ratios by reducing assets.
"The banking system is generally in compliance" with the
Basel capital standards, Mr. LaWare said, "but banks may want
a cushion if they expect they will take more losses in real
estate or LBO {leveraged buy-out} loans."
   In the real estate area, Mr. LaWare said he didn't see any
turnaround on the horizon for ailing markets in New England.
"It's hard to say" that real estate has bottomed out there,
he said. "I wish I could say with any conviction that it had.
There may still be some room to go down."
   Meanwhile, he expects West Coast real estate markets to
see further weakness. "I suspect there's some price
resistance settling in" in residential real estate, Mr.
LaWare said. "With the economy slowing, people are not
willing on the residential side to step up to those big
prices."

   At Nintendo, customer feedback helps us deliver
top-quality entertainment products. We were particularly
distressed, therefore, when our good customer, the Honorable
Alex Kozinski, offered his perspective in a July 27 Leisure &amp;
Arts page article.
   We share with Judge Kozinski an abiding concern for game
quality. We actively search world-wide for the best software
developers. Contrary to the judge's impression, we do not
control these developers. We work with them intensively to
unleash the creative talents that are so apparent in games
designed for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Our intensive
game-evaluation system, which includes input from players
such as Judge Kozinski, ensures that our developers are
constantly one step ahead in creating games that will pique
consumer interest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Our customer services have expanded since 1985 and have
become even more comprehensive. Game counselors now answer
over 50,000 consumer game inquiries on game play per week.
The Judge apparently had an unsatisfactory experience trying
to return a defective cartridge to an unnamed retailer. He
should be assured that Nintendo retailers will accept a
defective product for immediate exchange. Retailers receive
full credit for any defective products returned to Nintendo.
Customers who choose to send products directly to Nintendo
for repair can expect to receive their items back in just
three to five days on average. By the way, we pride ourselves
on a software defect rate of less than one percent.
   So we say to Judge Kozinski that we have not become "fat
and flabby." We do not take you and your son for granted as
Nintendo players. We know that, apart from your backgammon
board, there are other entertainment options available to you
inside and outside the video game business. Whatever your
doubts, we have the perfect prescription for your apparent
game burnout, an exciting new brainteaser, "Dr. Mario," which
comes to market this fall. It is sure to be another of the
Nintendo mega-hits.

   WASHINGTON -- A federal agency that provides retirement

   Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.), in a letter to Budget
Director Richard Darman, said that auditors for the Railroad
Retirement Board's inspector general reviewed 19 railroads
and found "$73 million in nonpayment of taxes, including
interest and penalties." The payroll taxes fund the benefits
for the nation's railroad workers. More than 1,100 railroads
weren't audited, Rep. Conyers noted.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, Rep. Conyers, who heads the Government
Operations Committee, said that the Treasury Department
didn't transfer $152.6 million in tax receipts to the
railroad board for four months, costing the retirement trust
funds about $4.4 million in interest.
   The findings "show an alarming lack of oversight by the
Treasury Department and significant under-reporting of
payroll taxes by railroad employers," Rep. Conyers said. He
cited an inspector general's report that concluded that the
Internal Revenue Service hadn't adequately monitored railroad
compliance with tax laws. The IRS and a Treasury Department
spokesman said they hadn't seen Rep. Conyers's letter and
couldn't comment.
   A senior Bush administration official, who asked not to be
named, said Rep. Conyers was piggybacking on the
administration's work. He said a White House budget office
"swat team" from various federal agencies uncovered serious
problems in the railroad retirement program earlier this
year. The administration, he said, notified Rep. Conyers and
others in Congress. He said the administration is preparing
corrective legislation.

   DALLAS -- Southland Corp. extended its debt-swap offer and
its deal with Ito-Yokado Co., its Japanese suitor, as
expected, after falling far short of getting the approval
from bondholders needed to complete either deal.
   According to the company's latest bond-exchange offer,
dated July 16, the company needs to have 95% of each class of
bonds tendered in order to consummate the deal. Only 28.2% of
the company's 16.5% notes were tendered in the deal. The
highest approval, 74.7%, came in the 13.5% senior notes,
which are about 34%-held by investor Carl Icahn.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Icahn, of Mount Kisco, N.Y., said he tendered all of
his Southland bonds in the company's exchange offer. Mr.
Icahn owns an estimated $180 million of the senior reset
notes, as well as smaller positions in other Southland bonds.
   "We like the Southland offer," he said. "The Japanese are
putting equity in. That's what it takes to make these kinds
of deals work."
   The deal required only two-thirds of the perferred stock
to be tendered in the deal, and 83.5% were tendered,
Southland said. The company also said its bank creditors
approved a credit-agreement amendment essential to the deal.
The debt-swap offer was extended to midnight Aug. 23 and the
stock purchase agreement with Ito-Yokado was extended to
Sept. 15.
   The acceptance by bondholders, while short of the required
95%, was "extraordinary" for such deals, said James Heffernan
of Whitman, Heffernan &amp; Rhein Workout Fund, which tendered
its 13.5% bonds. Usually, bondholders know that such offers
will be extended and they don't tender by the first deadline
date, he said. "These are among the best figures I've seen
for a voluntary exchange," he said.
   Analysts observed, though, that Southland's exchange offer
was most popular with holders of its 13 1/2% senior notes,
who would get more Southland equity than other bondholders
under the restructuring plan. Holders of subordinated bonds,
who wouldn't get as much equity, appeared to be holding out
for better terms.
   Some investors with lower-ranking bonds voiced concern
that Southland may try a pre-packaged plan to quickly enter
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to force the hand of
bondholders who are holding out.
   "I'm afraid it might turn out not to be a quicky
bankruptcy. This could turn into just a regular bankruptcy,"
which would take many more months to settle, said William
Eddleman Jr., director of fixed income research for
Dallas-based Barre &amp; Co., a major holder of three classes of
the bonds along with its clients.
   Mr. Eddleman, who declined to say whether his firm had
tendered its 15 3/4%, 16 1/2% and 16 3/4% bonds, said
questions over the seniority that was granted to some of the
classes over others could become a major legal issue in a
bankruptcy. That could extend the bankruptcy proceedings
beyond the four months expected for a pre-packaged
bankruptcy.
   The exchange offer, the first approved by the bondholder
committee, would give bondholders about 25% of the common
stock of the company. The founding Thompson family of Dallas
would get about 5% of the stock and Ito-Yokado, operator of
7-Eleven stores in Japan, would get about 70% for $430
million.
   Southland, the troubled parent of the 7-Eleven convenience
store chain, went into default on its $1.8 billion publicly
traded debt in mid-July, but avoided being forced into
bankruptcy at that time by getting a tentative nod from the
bondholder committee for the most recent exchange offer. The
company owns about 6,700 7-Eleven and other convenience
stores in the U.S. and Canada. Increased competition eroded
sales and profit margins and made it difficult for the
company to service the huge debt from the buy-out.

   Shearson Takes Lower Interest Payment
   On Loan to Prime Computer's Parent

   BEDFORD, Mass. -- Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. has agreed
to accept less interest on a $500 million loan to the parent
of Prime Computer Inc. in exchange for a larger equity stake
in the big computer maker.
   The move comes as Prime reported operating profit of $19.2
million for the second quarter, its first operating profit in
six quarters, on higher revenue of $403.5 million. Prime was
acquired last year in a $1.3 billion leveraged buy-out by DR
Holdings, a closely held unit of J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a New
York investment concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The revision in loan terms appears to acknowledge
Shearson's difficulty in unloading the debt on the junk bond
market. "This was a bridge too far, the six-week loan that
went on forever," says Byron Walker, a credit analyst at
Moody's Investors Service Inc. "It's a big embarrassment."
   Julie T. Katzman, a Shearson vice president, said that
Prime "has been servicing its debt and delivering terrific
performance." She said that Shearson doesn't plan to write
off any of the debt and that "in the long run we expect our
investment in Prime will give us extremely attractive capital
gains." She said the move reflected Shearson's confidence in
the long-term prospects of Prime and the collapse of a viable
public market for acquisition-related junk debt.
   DR Holdings disclosed a net loss of $36.2 million for its
second quarter, reflecting purchase accounting and interest
payments and including such non-cash charges as depreciation
and amortization of goodwill. Its results aren't directly
comparable with Prime's year-ago loss of $19 million, on
revenue of $382 million. Prime's stock isn't publicly traded,
though it still has debt outstanding.
   Shearson and Prime executives said that under the revised
loan terms, Prime will pay a sharply lower rate equal to
about 12.5%, or 4% over the floating London interbank rate,
rising to 5% over that rate in 1993 -- saving Prime about $40
million a year over current interest costs. In return,
Shearson will get an additional 7.5% equity interest in DR
Holdings, and a further 1% of equity every quarter the
present loan is outstanding to a maximum of 25%. Through
direct and indirect holdings, Shearson currently holds a 19%
stake in Prime.
   Shearson is a unit of American Express Co.
   Lawrence W. Eckenfelder, a Prudential-Bache analyst, said
the revision of terms of the Prime loan "sounds like a good
move for Shearson, assuming they recover their principle some
day." He added that those concerns had diminished recently as
Prime's results improved, "though Shearson certainly isn't
out of the woods yet."
   Prime had been under siege by investor Bennett S. LeBow --
backed by the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert -- until
J.H. Whitney acquired it a year ago. Since then, Prime has
reported a string of losses on declining sales and cut its
payroll by 2,500, to 9,100 workers.
   Yesterday's reported results represented significant gains
for Prime. "It was a terrific quarter for us," said James F.
McDonald, vice chairman and chief executive. He said the
company has become increasingly focused on software and
services, which now account for more than 70% of revenue,
with the traditional minicomputer business amounting to less
than 30%. The computer-aided-design business, boosted by the
$435 million acquisition of Computervision Corp. in 1988, has
become the fastest growing part of the company, he said.
   Despite its problems, Prime has attracted high-profile
management talent since the buy-out. In January, former
Digital Equipment Corp. senior vice president John J. Shields
joined as president and chief operating officer. Also, Prime
recently won a $180 million piece of a five-year Electronic
Data Systems Corp. Army computer contract.

   SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- Raven Industries Inc. plans to
increase its quarterly dividend 20%, and expects to report
that net income for the second quarter ended July 31 rose
about 8%, David Christensen, president and chief executive
officer said.
   The company attributed the earnings increase to a high
level of defense-equipment sales for the quarter.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Christensen said Raven will soon announce a dividend
increase to nine cents a share from 7.5 cents a share,
payable Oct. 15 to stock of record Sept. 21.
   He estimated that net in the second quarter rose to about
$1.3 million, or 42 cents a share, compared with $1.2
million, or 38 cents, a year ago. Sales fell roughly 2% to
$21.4 million from $21.8 million.
   In the six months, Mr. Christensen estimated that net rose
9% to $2.3 million, or 74 cents a share, from $2.1 million,
or 66 cents. Sales fell about 3% to $40.9 million from $42.3
million.
   The company's backlog of orders as of July 31 rose 18% to
$43.2 million from $36.7 million a year ago.
   Raven's electronics division will report that operating
profit more than doubled, largely because of increases in
orders for defense-related equipment. Sales of agricultural
controls for herbicide sprayers were also strong, said Mr.
Christensen.
   The plastics division, which makes glass fiber tops for
pickup trucks and tanks for storing industrial chemicals,
expects a 76% increase in operating profit from last year's
second quarter.
   The clothing division expects to report that operating
profit fell 39%, partly from the loss of a contract with the
Defense Department to make uniforms.
   Mr. Christensen said he expects to report "record" sales
and profit for the year ending Jan. 31, but he declined to
elaborate. Last year the company earned $4.2 million, or
$1.31, on sales of $91 million.

   `Texas Recovery' Stock Plays Pegged to Oil

   NEW YORK -- If you've pumped oil stocks into your
portfolio but are still looking for ways to speculate on
higher oil prices, Wall Street has a few "Texas recovery"
stocks you could use to top off the tank.
   The idea is that rising oil prices will lift the Texas
economy. But these aren't plays for the faint of heart. They
involve industries such as banking, media and retailing, all
of which have been out of favor with stock market investors
and are vulnerable to a slowdown in the general economy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The companies the Street is recommending have substantial
operations outside the Southwest that might not benefit from
higher oil prices. Moreover, a rapid recovery of the Texas
economy depends heavily on a sustained rise in oil prices,
which is far from a sure thing.
   Still, the logic of an accelerated oil-patch recovery
seems compelling to some on Wall Street. Edward Kerschner,
chairman of PaineWebber's investment policy committee, came
up with a short list of potential Texas beneficiaries right
after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   The list includes two banks with big operations in Texas,
Chemical Banking and NCNB; A.H. Belo, which owns the Dallas
Morning News and television stations in Dallas, Houston, and
Tulsa, Okla.; and the retailer Neiman Marcus Group, which
gets about 25% of its revenue from Texas.
   Other Wall Street analysts who specialize in the banking
and retailing industries are intrigued by the Texas recovery
play but offer a slightly different menu of choices.
   In banking, they point to Banc One and First Interstate
Bancorp, which also have significant Texas banking
subsidiaries. In retailing, another choice is Dillard
Department Stores, which isn't as glitzy as Neiman Marcus but
draws more of its revenue from the Southwest.
   Belo is well regarded by media analysts and viewed as one
of the few newspaper companies at which advertising revenue
is on the way up instead of down.
   Perhaps the toughest calls to make are those involving
Texas banking. Because of the devastation in the Lone Star
state's banking industry in the past few years, the region's
biggest banking franchises now are in the hands of
out-of-state banks. In assessing how these banks from New
York, California, North Carolina and Ohio may benefit from a
Texas recovery, analysts warn, it is important to remember
how each bank acquired its Texas unit.
   Chemical and First Interstate acquired their Texas banks
on a "going concern" basis, without the benefit of financial
aid from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., notes Allerton
G. Smith, a First Boston bank analyst. These Texas banks, Mr.
Smith says, "have had considerable asset-quality problems."
The task of working out those problems "is not yet complete."
   This situation presents both risk and opportunity. The
opportunity is that a sustained rise in oil prices may turn
some bad loans or properties into good ones. The risk:
Chemical and First Interstate will continue to own these
banks and their troubled assets whether the Texas economy
revives or not.
   "The banks that will benefit the most if there is an
uptick in the Texas economy are the ones with the highest
levels of nonperforming loans," Mr. Smith says. He calls this
the "recovering asset play."
   The play is different at NCNB and Banc One, which acquired
their Texas banks courtesy of the FDIC. Because of agreements
that allow NCNB and Banc One to "put" souring loans back to
the FDIC -- return them like unwanted wedding presents --
these two banking companies are largely insulated against
problems that develop in loans made by the previous
management, and hence wouldn't benefit much from rising asset
values alone.
   "NCNB and Banc One bought effectively sanitized banks with
the option to `put' future problems to regulators, when and
if they're discovered," Mr. Smith says. But he believes NCNB
and Banc One, which are trying to bring aggressive,
consumer-oriented retail banking to Texas, could benefit from
a surge in consumer spending if Texans believe their
long-wounded economy is on the mend.
   Officials of Banc One agree. A rise in oil prices, says a
spokesman, "lifts the spirits of the economy in Texas and
Louisiana and the other oil states. People have a better
outlook and a better feeling, and will likely spend a little
more money and get the economy going a little faster."
   In percentage terms, NCNB has the biggest stake in Texas,
with 51% of its total assets of $66.2 billion there. About
32% of the $40 billion of assets that Banc One manages are in
a Texas bank, which Banc One owns jointly with the FDIC. Banc
One will buy full ownership of the Texas bank within two
years.
   Though Mr. Smith sees Chemical and First Interstate as
potential short-term plays, he prefers NCNB or Banc One
because of their consumer banking strategies. "Long term," he
says, "the retail distribution concept at NCNB or Banc One is
the investment concept I would prefer to use here."
   One bank that analysts aren't recommending as a play on
the Texas economy is First City Bancorp. Though it is one of
the few remaining big Texas banks with publicly traded
shares, First City is viewed as vulnerable to problems far
from its Houston base. Among the First City borrowers that
have entered bankruptcy-law proceedings this year are Drexel
Burnham Lambert of New York, Federated Department Stores of
Cincinnati, Garfinckel's of Washington, D.C., and Circle K of
Phoenix, Ariz.
   In posting second-quarter earnings, First City disclosed
that because of a previous commitment, it now has "a
substantial direct lending relationship with a European
group" and is helping the borrower sell certain assets
backing the loan. The assets, First City said, "include
properties located in a renowned Mediterranean resort and in
a major European capital."
   Eric I. Hemel, a First Boston banking and thrift analyst,
rates First City a "hold." He says, "The primary concern
among investors in First City is its out-of-state loans, not
its in-state loans." The recent European loan is a problem
because of the "mystery factor," Mr. Hemel says. "Nobody
knows what it is or why it's there."
   Neiman Marcus, perhaps more than any other retailer, is
associated with Texas-style conspicuous consumption,
symbolized by at least one truly big-ticket item in each of
its catalogs. The latest is a one-month round-the-world trip
by supersonic Concorde for $40,800 a person ($42,800 if you
want a room of your own).
   But Neiman Marcus now has stores in 20 cities, only three
of which are in Texas. And the stock that travels under the
Neiman Marcus name includes ownership of two other retailers
at opposite ends of the fashion -- and price -- spectrum:
tony Bergdorf Goodman, with a single store on Fifth Avenue in
New York City, and youth-oriented Contempo Casuals, with 228
stores in regional shopping malls.
   Peter Farwell, a Neiman Marcus vice president, says sales
at the Neiman Marcus store in the Houston Galleria have been
growing faster than at any other store in the chain. "We've
seen an impressive recovery already," Mr. Farwell says,
adding that a rise in oil prices "certainly couldn't hurt
it."
   What could hurt Neiman Marcus, however, is its Horchow
mail-order catalog business. For the fiscal year that ended
in early August, Horchow is expected to post an operating
loss "substantially larger" than the $8.3 million operating
loss a year earlier, Mr. Farwell says. Horchow is trying to
cut costs and improve productivity.
   Jeffrey B. Edelman, a retailing analyst at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, describes Horchow as a "bottomless pit" for
Neiman Marcus and notes that the company will continue to
expand its store base, diluting Texas's contribution to the
bottom line.
   As a Texas recovery play, Mr. Edelman prefers Dillard
Department Stores, which he estimates gets about 50% of its
revenue from Southwestern states. Dillard "is probably as
good a beneficiary as any in retailing" from an increase in
oil prices, Mr. Edelman says. This week, Dillard completed a
stock offering.
   Because of a sense that the Texas economy was coming back
to life even before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the veteran
media analyst John Morton of Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan views A.H.
Belo as one of the few currently attractive stocks in the
newspaper industry.
   In the case of Texas, Mr. Morton quips: "They've been in a
depression for years. A recession looks like up to them."
Though Belo also owns television stations in Sacramento,
Calif., and Norfolk, Va., most of its properties are squarely
in the oil patch.
   Mr. Morton believes Belo could be a double play of sorts,
because management has revived the flagship Dallas Morning
News and someday could drive the rival Dallas Times-Herald
out of business. If the situation "plays out the way it has
played out in other markets," such as Washington, Cleveland
and Philadelphia, Mr. Morton says, "that will be a big
bonus."

   Fildes Quits Top Cetus Jobs
   In Wake of FDA's Rebuff

   Cetus Corp.'s embattled president and chief executive
officer, Robert Fildes, resigned under pressure yesterday,
two weeks after a Food and Drug Administration panel rebuffed
its cancer drug interleukin-2. In addition, more than 10% of
the company faces layoffs next month, according to Cetus.
   The hot-tempered Mr. Fildes, 52 years old, is being
succeeded by Cetus veterans who seem to have been selected to
neutralize his combative legacy and to woo FDA regulators
whose help Cetus needs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ronald E. Cape, 56, the founder and chairman of Cetus who
is regarded as the company's scientific visionary, succeeds
Mr. Fildes as chief executive. Hollings Renton, 43, who
previously had risen from chief financial officer to chief
operating officer, now becomes president as well.
   The biotechnology company, burdened by losses stemming
largely from its $120 million investment in IL-2, also said
it will reduce its 950-person work force by 100 people
beginning in September. Other belt-tightening measures are
expected, and Cetus is now actively seeking a deep-pocketed
partner to help fund development of IL-2 and other products.
   Cetus, its morale at its lowest ebb ever, has been slapped
with at least two lawsuits by shareholders angry over the
IL-2 debacle. The company's stock, which had traded as high
as $22.50 during the past year, slid to $13 after the FDA
hearing and closed yesterday at $8.75, down 50 cents, in
national over-the-counter trading.
   Mr. Fildes, a 30 year-veteran of the pharmaceutical
industry, will remain a consultant to Cetus. "My sense of
priorities and the board of directors' priorities differed,"
he said, in an interview, but declined to identify the bone
of contention. Indeed, he said the strategy made public
yesterday by Cetus was one "I and my management team put
together." Though Mr. Fildes denied it, some industry
observers believe it was the former president's style, as
much as his substance, that was at issue.
   When the FDA panel rejected Cetus's bid for IL-2 approval
on July 30, asking for more data, Mr. Fildes fired off a
defiant statement, labeling the move "a tragedy" for advanced
kidney cancer patients who have no other hope. Even analysts
such as Denise Gilbert of County NatWest Securities, who
strongly backs the product, winced at his "belligerent" stand
at a time when Cetus needed to send a message of conciliation
on complex scientific issues.
   Sources close to the FDA, noting the panel had sent Cetus
back for better data analysis and spared it the stigma of a
formal negative vote against IL-2, said regulators were
affronted by the attack.
   In an interview yesterday during his first afternoon as
president, Mr. Renton was the voice of conciliation and
subdued confidence about possibilities for Cetus's
turnaround. But he didn't try to minimize the depth of the
pit into which Cetus's morale and credibility has plunged.
Rather than blaming the FDA as his predecessor had done, he
stressed that "it's our job -- the company's job -- to
convince the FDA that this drug should be approved. We've got
to rebuild credibility. We've been damaged in everybody's
eyes."
   Analysts generally greeted the changes announced yesterday
as strong but salutary medicine. But they questioned whether
they were enough to cure the problems at Cetus, based in
Emeryville, Calif.
   Robert Kupor, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New
York, praised the new executive team as "more level, more
realistic, less bombastic and less emotional" than old
leadership. But, he said, "these actions dramatize the extent
of Cetus's problems without sufficiently correcting them."
Even with a 10% cut in expenditures, and even if the company
can summon enough data to get IL-2 approved by year end, Mr.
Kupor predicts Cetus will continue to post losses until 1993.
   "This is positive for Cetus," Ms. Gilbert said, adding
that Mr. Fildes led Cetus in building up a huge
infrastructure, expecting IL-2 to be approved in 1990. "Now
there's a risk of having to do clinical trials over again,
and a need to reduce expenses. At some point, Bob {Fildes}
must have disagreed with that."
   With Cetus's stock price now depressed, Ms. Gilbert fears
the company is in great danger of a takeover and a piecemeal
sell-off. "I think there's more value in the pieces of the
company than in Cetus as a whole," she said.
   Large companies may be hungrily looking at Cetus's PCR
technology, which uses gene amplification to do everything
from diagnosing diseases to identifying criminals, she said.
Others may covet its generic chemotherapy drug business,
which generated $30 million in sales in the year ended June
30. There is also Cetus's research portfolio, including IL-2
and experimental drugs for a raft of cancers and infectious
diseases, she added.
   As recently as last week, Mr. Fildes pluckily insisted on
the value of Cetus's business and the richness of its
research pipeline. "The question isn't whether Cetus becomes
profitable," he said, "but when." That's one theme Mr. Renton
continued to sound yesterday, contending Cetus will mine the
value in PCR, chemotherapy and IL-2, as well as in other
products such as the blood-cell growth factor M-CSF.
   So far, Cetus still hasn't obtained a date for its meeting
with the FDA to seek clearer guidance on what it needs to do.
The FDA panel principally objected to the methods in Cetus's
study and its failure to document that IL-2 not only shrinks
kidney tumors, but actually prolongs patients' lives. Also,
because the drug is toxic and seems to help only 20% of
kidney cancer patients, the panel asked Cetus to pinpoint
which patients seem most likely to respond to treatment.
Scientists and analysts said this won't be easy.
   "I think they'll have a harder time than we did,"
predicted Elliott Grossbard, director of clinical research
for Genentech Inc., which suffered a similar rebuff on its
first FDA hearing for the heart drug TPA. But Genentech was
able to bounce back quickly because "we had the data between
our hip pocket and our drawer," he recalled. "Cetus may not
have those studies," added Dr. Grossbard.
   Mr. Kupor of Kidder Peabody said that there's a lesson for
the entire biotechnology industry in Cetus's rebuff by the
FDA: "Even though the FDA told you that you probably don't
need to do a placebo-controlled trial, you should probably do
them anyway." He said the surest and most convincing way to
get a drug approved is still to test a new drug against a
sugar pill.
   Instead of doing such a study, Cetus had compared
IL-2-treated patients against a different study group
receiving the drug beta interferon. But the control group
turned out to be older and sicker than the IL-2 group, thus
invalidating any comparison, said FDA scientist Jay Siegel.
   Judith Blakemore, Cetus vice president of biological
therapy development, insisted Cetus can statistically
"correct" for such flaws, salvage its study and get IL-2
approved without spending costly years of additional work to
redo its clinical trials.
   "The FDA has never asked us to do a placebo-controlled
trial," she said. "You just can't do it in this disease. The
outcome would be too poor for the untreated group." For his
part, Mr. Renton says he hopes the existing study can be
preserved, but he hastened to add that the FDA will be the
judge, "and I'm not pre-empting anything the agency might
say."
   Besides being Cetus's tattered flagship and last best hope
of profitability, the drug remains the only active agent for
patients with advanced kidney cancer -- a fact even FDA panel
members conceded. One intensely interested party is Eugene
Schonfeld, a patient who founded the National Kidney Cancer
Association. "We know it's no miracle cure," he said of IL-2.
"But it's our best shot."

   Tokyo stocks posted steep losses amid futures-linked
selling, correcting after Wednesday's huge advance, traders
said.
   In London, meanwhile, shares finished lower, jostled by
what appeared to be mounting tensions in the Middle East.

<TEXT>
   Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 562.68 points to
27549.44 Thursday following Wednesday's surge of 1439.59
points.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index plummeted another 870.59
points to close the morning session at 26678.85.
   Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
300 million shares, down from 458.4 million shares Wednesday.
Losers outpaced winners 618 to 283, while 166 issues were
unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 32.13 points, or 1.53%, to 2067.36.
   The second section index added 12.96 points, or 0.32%, to
4113.67. Volume in the section was estimated at 14.7 million
shares, up from 11.9 million shares Wednesday.
   Observers said a correction had been expected, as factors
such as uncertainty about the Middle East conflict and
fundamental weakness haven't changed.
   Stephen Leist, manager of equity sales at S.G. Warburg
Securities (Japan) Inc., said that despite Wednesday's
massive upward move, Persian Gulf developments remain a focus
of concern. But even if a diplomatic solution is reached, he
noted, the market still suffers from valuation problems.
   Mr. Leist added the recent strength of the yen, which has
firmed as the dollar hasn't proved to be anyone's safe haven,
is one of the few favorable factors for the market. But the
yen's rise hasn't been stellar, providing only underlying
support rather than an incentive for buying.
   Interest-rate worries, in part linked to higher oil
prices, and persistent evidence that the U.S. economy is
slowing, continue to discourage investors from returning to
the market, traders said.
   "Investors just aren't interested in equity right now,"
said Isao Takahashi, trader at James Capel Pacific Ltd. "Most
investors are waiting for the {Nikkei index} to come back to
30000 points. Without that, they're not going to be active in
equity."
   This week's Japanese "O-Bon" festival season has
contributed to the market's thinner activity, although
traders said they doubt that volume will pick up when
holidays are over.
   Trading will likely be thin and volatile Friday as well,
traders predicted.
   With hardly any retail activity, futures and
options-linked trading has led market movement. Thursday,
futures were sold off early in the morning to a discount
level to the cash indexes.
   Sentiment that futures had been driven too high over
recent days, bought higher partly on the notion that they
were oversold, led to the selling, participants said.
   At least one of the Big Four domestic firms was seen
buying selectively Thursday, giving support to shares such as
TDK, up 130 yen to 6750 yen (88 cents to $45.76). Advantest
rose 270 yen to 5950 yen.
   Moreover, traders said speculative groups were testing
their chances by buying shares such as Kuraray, up 10 yen to
1340 yen, and Kurabo, up 70 yen to 1390 yen.
   Oil shares surged again, led by Teikoku Oil, up 50 yen to
1540 yen, and Nippon Oil, up 40 yen to 1320 yen.
   Electric power shares were down. Tokyo Electric Power fell
90 yen to 3500 yen, Chubu Electric Power fell 110 yen to 2880
yen, and Kansai Electric Power dropped 90 yen to 2900 yen.
   Shares of securities companies were lower. Nomura fell 80
yen to 1850 yen, Nikko dropped 20 yen to 1020 yen, Daiwa
dropped 60 yen to 1180 yen, and Yamaichi fell 50 yen to 1010
yen.
   Also hit hard were high-tech shares, including Sony, down
230 yen to 7850 yen, Pioneer, down 110 yen to 5550 yen, and
Kyocera, down 180 yen to 8000 yen.
   Throughout most of the session in London, shares drifted
without much investor interest as participants flattened out
positions for the slow summer season. And amid the current
climate of confusion in world equity markets, dealers said
participants couldn't find much justification to invest anew
in the market.
   Also, several developments from the Persian Gulf,
including news that Britons and Americans held in Kuwait were
being rounded up and taken to an unspecified hotel, as well
as remarks from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, set investors
clearly on edge.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index fell
17.2 points to 2222.1, just above the day's low of 2220.8.
The Financial Times 30 Share Index was down 23.30 points to
1724.9. Volume was 375.4 million shares, down from 563.6
million issues Wednesday, when trading was inflated by
Imperial Chemical Industries' sale of its 232 million
Enterprise Oil shares.
   "We've seen relative calm in world markets for the last
couple of days but it looks like that's all been shattered
now," said one market watcher. "Wall Street is sliding and
we're dropping right along with it."
   Another commentator said the market retreated on "nervous
pressure," as the scenario of "comment and counter-comment"
from developments in the Middle East gripped the market. "The
key is whether all this talk will actually lead to anything,"
he said.
   The sharpest drop on the day was Reuters Holdings, which
slumped 80 pence to 929 pence ($1.52 to $17.65). The shares
were sold after U.S. brokerage firm Wertheim Schroder
downgraded the stock and removed it from a recommended buy
list. A total of 5.2 million shares were traded in London.
   Royal Insurance fell 17 pence to 433 pence after reporting
a half-year pretax loss of #65 million. Other composite
insurers fell in sympathy, with Commercial Union falling 12
pence to 487 pence, General Accident slipping 8 pence to 497
pence, and Guardian Royal edging down 4 pence to 207 pence.
   Water stocks were again sought for their defensive
qualities, as were food retailers. NorthWest Water rose a
penny to 239 pence, Thames Water gained 3 pence to 234 pence,
Sainsbury advanced a penny to 296 pence, and Tesco hardened 4
pence to 225.5 pence.
   Meanwhile, shares closed higher in Paris, Milan and
Madrid, mixed in Brussels and Amsterdam, and lower in
Frankfurt, Zurich and Stockholm. South African gold stocks
closed higher.
   Also, stocks ended lower in Seoul, higher in Taipei and
Hong Kong, and mixed in Singapore, Manila, Wellington and
Sydney.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The

   U.K. Slowdown Takes Uneven Toll
   As Once-Booming Areas Stagnate

   LONDON -- Britain's economic slowdown has had an uneven
effect: Using the usual yardsticks, the once-booming
southeast and the West Midlands already are in recession,
while other parts of the U.K. expect some continued growth.
   The patchwork pattern emerged from a regional study by the
Confederation of British Industry and Business Strategies
Ltd. Based on a survey of manufacturers throughout the U.K.,
the two organizations found that the government's policy of
high interest rates has had divergent effects on investment
plans, output expectations and export orders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The pattern stands in contrast to the one-time north-south
divide, in which northern Britain chronically trailed the
more prosperous south. So far at least, northern England,
Scotland, and Northern Ireland seem to have staved off the
most damaging effects of the economic downturn.
   London and the southeast have been dragged down faster
than the rest of the U.K. Business optimism there has fallen
further than in any other region. Manufacturers in the area
also reported the lowest level of capacity utilization in the
U.K. Although the southeast is also home to many service
companies, such concerns often depend on business from
traditional industries and have suffered with the slump in
manufacturing.
   Consumers in the southeast have saved less and borrowed
more than their counterparts in the north, CBI economists
said. As a result, the last year of interest-rate increases
has hit them harder.
   Costs of materials and parts have risen, but weakening
demand has made it difficult to increase prices of finished
manufactured goods. As a result, manufacturers in the
southeast reported that their profit margins have been
squeezed.
   The West Midlands, where the U.K.'s auto industry is
concentrated, showed the gloomiest prospects for expanded
output. Sluggish demand for automobiles hit not only car
producers but metal companies and engineering concerns that
serve the industry. Companies in the region expect falling
output and rising unemployment in the next four months.
Unsurprisingly, capital investment in the region has
slackened and is expected to fall off further, according to
the survey.
   Economic optimism was relatively strong in the province of
Northern Ireland, despite the chronic sectarian conflict
there. The survey showed that exports have been growing and
output has expanded. The level of planned investment in
plants and machinery in Northern Ireland is higher than in
any other region in the U.K.
   Companies surveyed in Scotland have been hurt by weak
demand at home, but they reported relatively healthy levels
of export orders. In recent months, manufacturing output in
Scotland has risen, and the number of firms operating below
full capacity has fallen.
   Though they were affected in varying degrees, firms in all
the regions said they have been pinched by the currently high
interest rates. In an effort to wring inflation out of the
economy, the Thatcher government has increased base interest
rates to 15%, which has tipped dozens of small and
medium-sized companies into bankruptcy and weakened consumer
demand. Two other developments are likely to make things
worse for U.K. manufacturers: increases in oil prices arising
from the Middle East crisis and the continued strength of the
pound, which is cutting into export orders by making British
goods more costly overseas. Economists expect that interest
rates will be reduced sometime after the pound becomes a full
participant in the European Monetary System, which links the
participating currencies in set bands of fluctuation. The
U.K. is expected to join the arrangement sometime in the next
five or six months.
