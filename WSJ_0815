   Gene That Spurs Lung Cancer Is Found

   Discovery Helps to Explain
   Why Some Smokers Get
   Disease, Researchers Say

   Scientists uncovered a gene they suspect holds the key to
how cigarette smoke causes lung cancer.
   Tests of tissues from lung cancer patients indicated that
a particular gene had been "turned on" in the patients and
was producing a protein that turned chemicals in cigarette
smoke or other inhaled chemicals into powerful cancer-causing
substances.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   If true, this would explain one of the major mysteries of
smoking-related lung cancer. This is the fact that despite
decades of analysis, the known cancer-causing chemicals in
cigarette smoke don't account for its apparent ability to
cause lung cancer in humans.
   The discovery of the gene also suggested why only 5% to 7%
of long-term cigarette smokers develop lung cancer. The
scientists speculated the suspect gene is turned on more
easily in some people than in others, rendering them most
likely to get lung cancer if they smoke. Some people may be
born with a high likelihood that the gene will be turned on
and they are in danger of developing lung cancer even if they
don't smoke, speculated Theodore L. McLemore, a pulmonary
disease specialist who headed the research team.
   If the theory proposed in the new report is correct, it
may be possible to screen cigarette smokers and pinpoint
those at highest risk of developing lung cancer, Dr. McLemore
said in a telephone interview. It also should be possible to
screen families of lung cancer victims to see which relatives
might have inherited a predisposition to the deadly diseases.
   The new report, published in the current issue of the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute, comes but two weeks
after two other reports suggesting that a genetic
predisposition to lung cancer makes it extremely dangerous
for those born with the predisposition to smoke cigarettes.
One of these reports showed that smoking-related lung cancer
tended to run in families. The other showed that the
genetically-controlled manner in which the body processed a
particular drug seemed linked to a susceptibility to lung
cancer.
   The report pinpoints a specific gene that is closely
linked to, if not the cause of, the cancer-producing process.
The gene is known as the CYP1A1 gene, according to the report
by Dr. McLemore and his colleagues at the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md., and the Johns Hopkins University
medical school in Baltimore.
   Dr. McLemore left the cancer institute at the end of July
to go into private practice in Paris, Texas, where, he says,
he plans to continue his research on the lung-cancer gene.
   In their report, the researchers said they had examined
the activity of the CYP1A1 gene in lung tissues taken from 56
men and women who had been operated on for lung cancer at
Johns Hopkins.
   The researchers tested the normal, or noncancerous,
portions of lung tissues from the patients for signs of
whether the gene was active or not. The tests indicated that
the gene was active, or "turned on," in 17 of 19 smokers but
was inactive in all five of the patients who had never
smoked. Examination of the normal lung tissues from other
patients who had quit smoking indicated that the gene was
turned off in those who hadn't smoked for three months or
longer.
   They also found that in the cancerous tissues the gene was
more likely to be turned on in smokers than in nonsmokers.
   The findings "further support the theoretical role of the
CYP1A1 gene" in causing lung cancer by showing that is active
in smokers who develop lung cancer, the researchers said.
"However, it is not possible to conclude a definite cause and
effect relationship from these studies," they cautioned.
   Nevertheless, the scientists pointed to a plethora of
animal experiments which hinted that the protein produced by
the gene may well lead to cancer. It's known that production
of the protein, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, can be induced
by cigarette smoke, they noted. The protein, they said,
belongs to a "superfamily" of proteins, many of which are
capable of activating cancer-causing chemicals found in
cigarette smoke.

   Travel:
   More Airlines Are Following Flight Path of Fare Cuts

AIRLINES (AIR)
</IN>
<LP>
   CHICAGO -- The airline industry's move to pass rising
jet-fuel costs onto passengers unraveled as more carriers
slashed certain fares throughout their systems and delayed a
fuel-related fare increase for at least a week.
   Industry analysts said the actions don't bode well for the
industry's bottom line.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit and NWA Inc.'s
Northwest Airlines unit said late yesterday they plan to pare
vacation-type fares on all of their flights, matching cuts
announced by two rivals Monday. The move represents
reductions of between 15% to 40%.
   Because both carriers are among the country's largest
airlines, competitors almost certainly will be forced to trim
fares on virtually all the flights they offer. UAL Corp.'s
United Airlines and USAir Group Inc. yesterday indicated they
would do just that.
   American, Northwest and several other carriers also
announced they are postponing a 5.3% fare increase that was
to take effect tomorrow until next Thursday. That increase,
which follows failed attempts to raise prices by as much as
10%, comes amid a sharp run-up in the cost of aviation jet
fuel, one of the industry's largest operating expenses.
   Among the other airlines delaying the fare boosts are
United, USAir and Delta Air Lines, also among the nation's
largest carriers. Smaller companies, such as Midway Airlines,
said they are planning to do the same.
   "It's not good news," said Paul Karos, an airlines analyst
at First Boston in New York. "We all knew things weren't
good, but business is turning out worse than we expected."
   Mr. Karos yesterday slashed his 1990 earnings estimate for
AMR to $2.15 a share from $3.80 a share. Also, he cut his
1991 earnings estimate to $3.75 a share from $5.65 a share.
Both projections represent a sharp drop-off from AMR's
performance in 1989, when the Dallas-based firm posted net
income of $7.15 a share.
   American acknowledges that fare-cutting undermines its
efforts to curtail the impact of higher fuel prices. "It's a
blow," said a spokesman for the airline. Further underscoring
the industry's tough times, American yesterday confirmed Wall
Street reports that it has been reducing its traffic-growth
projections. The airline wouldn't specify how much it has
reduced those projections.
   Prices of many airline holding companies stocks slipped
yesterday, reflecting the industry's fresh turmoils. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, AMR stock
closed at $49 share, down $2.125 a share. UAL stock fell
$4.375 to close at $105.75. Delta dropped $1.875 to close at
$57.50.
   Initially, the fare discounting was restricted to the
limited number of cities served by Trans World Airlines and
Eastern Airlines, both of which announced cuts Monday. Both
carriers are operating domestic schedules scaled down from
earlier days when they were financially robust. As rivals
started matching the fare decreases yesterday, however, the
discounts spread throughout the industry's system.
   Passengers are likely to find the entire fare picture
confusing. If they qualify for the discounted fares, which
are heavily restrictive and in effect for now only until Aug.
29, they will reap the price declines. The promotional fares
-- which can only be used between Sept. 5 and Dec. 15 -- are
designed to drum up business during the slower fall and
winter period. If they don't meet the restrictions,
passengers likely face higher fares that reflect the rising
fuel costs.
   Airlines might use inventory management -- earmarking only
a certain number of seats for the discounts -- to keep
possible losses low. In addition, the discounted fares
probably will only attract vacationers who can plan ahead to
take advantage of the bargains. Most business travelers,
however, will likely continue paying for the industry's most
expensive tickets, because they usually schedule short jaunts
at the spur of the moment and buy the industry's most
expensive tickets.

   Economy:
   Philadelphia, Bypassed by '80s Boom,
   Hopes to Avoid the Recession's Worst

   Philadelphia's economy has escaped the fall from grace
seen in other Northeastern cities, mainly because it never
enjoyed the 1980s boom of a Boston or New York. But now it
appears to be mirroring the rest of the country in a slide
into recession.
   Construction and banking, for example, show signs of
decline, and the city government's fiscal woes don't help.
Still, economists expect the economy's "landing" in
Philadelphia to be reasonably soft.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Like the model of a diversified investment portfolio, the
Philadelphia area has a little bit of everything --
manufacturing, financial services, government, health care,
retailing, defense, and construction -- but nothing
dominates. The mix dooms Philadelphia to mediocrity during
booms, say economists, but protects it from a real bust
during downturns.
   "We're better off than Boston and New York because we're
less specialized. We didn't go as high, so we're not going to
sink as deep," says William J. Stull, chairman of the
economics department at Temple University and co-author of a
new book on the region's economy.
   Philadelphia may even be saved the marked deterioration in
residential real estate other cities are experiencing,
because there was no speculative boom in that market, says
Bernard M. Markstein III, senior economist and vice president
of Meridian Bancorp., a Reading, Pa., based bank.
   Philadelphia's one distinction is the abysmal state of
city finances. Moody's Investors Service Inc. labeled the
city's bonds "junk," or "speculative grade," in July, and
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. earlier this week said it is
considering a similar move. Philadelphia is the only major
U.S. city with bonds rated so low.
   Already saddled with a cumulative deficit of about $73
million, Philadelphia expects a $200 million deficit for the
fiscal year that began July 1, partly due to revenues
generally lower than the city projected and lower tax
payments from local developers, who are facing a business
decline. The city is trying to borrow $450 million in
short-term notes, and city officials warned this week that,
without such help, the government will run out of money in
November or December.
   A recession might worsen the city's problems by reducing
revenues, but if Philadelphia is forced to increase taxes,
that could create new problems. It would "aggravate the
migration . . . out of the city" by firms already
disenchanted with tax rates and poor services, says Patrick
Bradley, economist with Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Corp.,
a bank holding company, "And then you have a declining
revenue base." Rough times for city employees could lower
consumer spending, he adds.
   There is some good news. Philadelphia's many universities
continue to attract research dollars, says Mr. Markstein, and
the medical industry, also strong in Philadelphia, "tends to
be recession-proof. They can raise prices because much of it
is paid for by insurance."
   Yet, like much of the rest of the U.S., Philadelphia is
watching growth slow to a crawl -- or worse. The thrift
crisis, for example, is partly responsible for a plunge of
37% in commercial construction in the second quarter of 1990,
compared with 1989. Under pressure from regulators, banks are
more reluctant to lend money for speculative building. They
now require that 65% to 70% of space be committed in advance,
up from 35%, before lending money to developers, says Thomas
W. Coyne, vice president and resident manager of Coldwell
Banker Commerial Real Estate Service's Philadelphia office.
   Downtown commercial vacancy rates are now at least 10%,
according to several estimates, and are expected to go as
high as 15% by 1991.
   While overall unemployment remains lower for Philadelphia
than for some other urban areas, it has increased steadily,
from 3.6% in the second quarter of 1989 to an estimated 4.6%
in the 1990 second quarter, according to the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia.

   THE PIECES ARE PREPARED for a tax increase. But which will
be picked?
   Congressional negotiators plan to mix and match already
developed options to compose a tax increase for fiscal 1991.
A securities-transfer tax moves to the top of the list as the
Iraq upheaval makes an energy tax -- at least a big one --
less likely. Other strong bets are increases in sin taxes and
a new levy on luxury items, though defining luxury will be
tricky. Republicans are unlikely to get a capital gains tax
reduction unless Democrats get the top personal tax rate
raised.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Loud complaints about a GOP plan to trim the state
income-tax deduction endanger that proposal. But deductions
aren't safe. Across-the-board limits for the richest
Americans are still possible. High-income seniors could well
have more of their Social Security benefits taxed. Life
insurance companies could get whacked. And foreign firms are
still targets. "I don't see anything as off the table," a
senior tax committee aide says.
   One option, discussed by Democrats, could return: raising
the corporate tax rate.
                                                                                                       

   TAX POLITICS TURN PERSONAL, as GOP proposals entangle
Democrats.
   The Republicans' tentative plan to curb the state income
tax deduction is widely interpreted as a broadside against
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, one of President Bush's most
formidable potential rivals in 1992. "This has become a Bush
vs. Cuomo thing," says Republican Rep. McGrath of New York.
Republicans privately gloat that the proposal forces Cuomo to
defend a tax break for the wealthy. Cuomo's opposition to a
securities-transfer tax also has Republicans crowing.
   Though Bush aides praise tax summit chairman Gephardt for
his earnest efforts to combat the deficit, they spotlight him
with their beer-tax plan. The former Democratic presidential
candidate represents St. Louis, home of Anheuser-Busch, which
is the shrillest opponent of the GOP's beer-tax rise.
Meanwhile, one high-profile Democrat is eager to attach his
name to an option: Sen. Bentsen of Texas presses for
expansion of individual retirement account deductions.
                                                                                                       

   CAPITAL GAINS LOBBYISTS divide, weakening their cause.
   Investment houses dispatch their big guns to Washington,
but they concentrate on fighting the transfer tax, not
reducing capital gains. Indeed, a delegation tells Treasury
Secretary Brady they would rather have a higher top personal
tax rate and no capital gains cut than a transfer tax. Some
Wall Streeters even blame the capital gains issue for the
ascent of the transfer tax. "My response," sniffs gains-cut
advocate Mark Bloomfield, "is unprintable."
   The lobbyists also disagree over tactics. Corporate
advocate Charls Walker pushes a plan to cut capital gains
more deeply and more broadly than President Bush, and some
less zealous backers quietly resent the move. But dissent
spills over when two GOP senators threaten to attach the
provision to a debt-ceiling bill, even when they were
obviously short of a majority. "It was insane," one
capital-gains supporter asserts.
   Still, a capital gains cut remains likely as long as the
president makes it a priority.
                                                                                                       

   IT WOULD TAKE A MIRACLE for budget negotiators to meet
their ambitious schedule. But, for the record, the summit
plans to meet in seclusion Sept. 5, agree by Sept. 10, have
Congress pass the bill by Sept. 24, and get it signed by Oct.
2.
                                                                                                       

   STATE TAXES account for an increasing share of all taxes,
a legacy of Reagan-era cutbacks in federal aid, the National
Council of State Legislatures reports. In 1988, states
collected 26.5% of all taxes, up from 23.9% in 1980, 20.6% in
1970 and 15.9% in 1960.
                                                                                                       

   LUST IS on the wane. The tenth-of-a-cent tax per gallon on
gasoline to pay for the leaking underground storage tank
trust fund, or LUST, will disappear at the end of the month.
The IRS says its need for funds is satisfied.
                                                                                                       

   THE CASE OF THE MISSING TAXES baffles government and
private analysts.
   Tax receipts of all sorts are running well below
forecasts. The Treasury says total receipts through the end
of June were 3.7% below the year-ago level. Individual income
taxes, which account for close to half of all federal
receipts, were down 4.5%. The Congressional Budget Office
trims its forecast of this year's revenues by $27 billion and
next year's by $19 billion. The Bush administration lowers
its projections even more.
   The slowing economy is only partly responsible. Government
models incorrectly inflated forecasts of payroll-tax
receipts. More businesses may be electing Subchapter S status
to get favorable tax treatment. Investors might also have
delayed taking capital gains in anticipation of a lower rate.
"People are scratching their heads," says Ernst &amp; Young
analyst Pete Davis. The answer lies in IRS data that won't be
available for years. "When the dollars flow in, they don't
have labels on them," a Treasury official says.
   Lower-than-expected revenues account for over half of the
White House's higher deficit estimate.
                                                                                                       

   BRIEFS: The Congressional Budget Office retracts a study
that asserts that the low-income elderly wouldn't be harmed
by higher "sin" and gas taxes. . . . The IRS issues 79 pages
of written instructions to dividend and interest payers who
want to reduce paperwork by filing data on computer disks.

   Clouds Gathering Over the Farm Sector

   Grain Prices Fall on Mideast
   Crisis, Big Crop Forecast

   CHICAGO -- The farm economy is taking a turn for the
worse, threatened by storm clouds over the Middle East and
good crop-growing weather elsewhere.
   Grain prices are dropping amid projections that harvests
this year will be unexpectedly large across much of the
world. Wheat analysts, for instance, already have increased
their forecasts by 440 million bushels, an amount akin to the
output of Kansas, the biggest U.S. wheat-producing state. As
a result, wheat prices are approaching the depressed levels
reached before the 1988 drought. In trading at the Chicago
Board of Trade yesterday, the wheat contract for September
delivery settled at $2.795.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Production costs, though, are pointing upward. The Mideast
conflict is expected to raise the cost of fueling tractors
and combines for the fall harvests. The price of
nitrogen-based fertilizer, made from natural gas, also may be
higher by spring planting. The Agriculture Department
estimates that a $5-a-barrel jump in the price of oil
increases annual farm expenses by $900 million.
   At the same time, more economists are predicting
recession. A business downturn would almost certainly damp
consumer demand for beef and pork and bring meat prices down
from June's record levels at supermarkets. That in turn could
puncture the high prices farmers have been getting for their
cattle and hogs.
   "Farmers are facing a lot of whammies," said Raymond
Daniel, an economist at WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   Still, farmers generally are in the best shape in more
than a decade to weather a downturn. Hefty government
payments have helped reduce their debts to reasonable levels.
The price of land, their biggest asset, has climbed for three
years and many farmers have been able to replace their worn
equipment. Few see any economic calamity ahead on the scale
of the farm crisis of the early 1980s.
   Yet, the change in direction for the farm economy has been
very sudden. In the spring, corn prices were rising steadily
while fuel prices were low. And while many economists
continue to expect net farm income this year to meet or beat
last year's record $49 billion, some see net farm income
declining next year by $2 billion or more.
   "The farm economy has been its most robust in close to a
decade," said Neil E. Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa
State University. "Since Iraq, we can look ahead to it being
less robust."
   That's because, among other things, rising oil prices
won't be a boost for U.S. farmers as they were in the 1970s.
Then, oil-producing nations such as the Soviet Union and the
Gulf nations used their petrodollars to buy U.S. crops.
   This time, economic sanctions imposed against Iraq are
wiping out the eighth-biggest market for wheat farmers. The
wheat Iraq purchased kept about 1.2 million acres of U.S.
land in production. Iraq also was the single biggest buyer of
U.S. rice. Kuwait is also effectively cut off from the U.S.
grain pipeline.
   Higher oil revenue would help the Soviet Union tackle its
credit problems with U.S. grain exporters. But bumper crops
there are widely expected to pare, perhaps drastically, its
demand for U.S. crops.
   Last week, the Agriculture Department forecast that the
Soviet Union will import from all sources 30 million metric
tons of grain for the 12-month period ending June 1991. That
figure would represent a 21% decline from the previous year,
and the lowest level in four years. Some private analysts
speculate that Soviet crop imports could drop as low as 25
million metric tons. In recent years, the U.S. has been the
largest supplier of grain to the Soviet Union.
   China's need for U.S. crops is also expected to drop in
the wake of good growing conditions there. If a recession
materializes in the U.S. and spreads world-wide, it would
probably depress buying by Pacific Basin countries.
Meanwhile, some of the toughest competitors of the U.S. in
the grain trade, such as Canada, are also preparing to reap
large harvests. "There's going to be a great deal more
competition," said Andrew Bellingham, a vice president at
World Perspectives Inc., a Washington-based agricultural
economics firm.
   Since 1986, U.S. corn exports have nearly doubled to about
2.4 billion bushels. But analysts foresee exports sinking
next year, from only slightly to as much as 12%. Furthermore,
the U.S. also appears to be on the verge of harvesting a
large corn crop -- its biggest since 1986.
   In the wake of all this, corn prices have plunged about 45
cents a bushel, or 15%, since Independence Day. The corn
contract for September delivery settled yesterday at the
Chicago Board of Trade at $2.455. In the spring, corn prices
climbed on fears that poor planting conditions would damage
the crop. Since then, growing conditions have been nearly
ideal although the crop is maturing late.
   Nearly the same picture applies to wheat. The U.S. wheat
harvest this year is expected to jump by one-third from last
year's crop, which was damaged by dry weather. But some
private analysts expect overseas demand for U.S. wheat
through May to drop as much as 8%. The upshot is that more
crops are going into stockpiles, which can depress prices
further as they swell.
   For consumers, weakening crop prices don't necessarily
translate into lower grocery prices. The companies that make
everything from cereal to bread probably will adjust their
prices to reflect higher energy costs.
   The impact of that probably won't be felt fully until next
year. Paul Prentice, chief economist at Farm Sector Economics
Associates, already has raised his food-inflation projection
for 1991 to 5.5% from an original estimate of 4.4%.
   There are some expected big winners from the grain-price
decline and the oil-price rise. U.S. fertilizer manufacturers
could get a chance to put some of their idled capacity into
production because Kuwait has stopped exporting nitrogen.
   The once-tottering ethanol industry might have its most
profitable year. Last summer, many plants that convert corn
to ethanol were losing money because corn prices were
climbing while oil prices were low. Ethanol prices tend to
follow gasoline prices. In the Chicago area, the price of a
gallon of ethanol since Iraq's military action has risen a
dime to about $1.35 a gallon.

   Kazarian Close to Goal of Becoming
   Chairman of Allegheny International

   PITTSBURGH -- Paul B. Kazarian has been working
tenaciously the last 13 months to become chairman of
Allegheny International Inc.
   Today, he may finally realize his goal. But some might
wonder whether the unrelenting dogfight was worth it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The object of his desires, Allegheny is a shell of its
former self. It has spent the last 2 1/2 years trying to
resolve contentious and protracted bankruptcy proceedings.
The process, expected to close today after nearly a dozen
false starts, has battered the company's crown jewels,
appliance makers Sunbeam and Oster.
   Competitors snatched away market share and losses widened
while management was hamstrung by the bankruptcy proceedings
and distracted fending off, among others, Mr. Kazarian and
partner Michael Lederman, a director of the new company. And
uncertainty about who would end up owning Allegheny damped
employee morale and left retailers anxious.
   No one knows better than Mr. Kazarian, who through his
Japonica Partners began acquiring Allegheny's bankruptcy
claims at the beginning of the year. The executive, a former
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. investment banker, spent much of the
last year poring over the company's financial records and
market data, visiting plants and warehouses and meeting with
employees.
   And he's convinced that the new company, Sunbeam/Oster
Corp., will be a winner. The brash, 34-year-old executive,
who prefers baseball hats to ties, calls the old Allegheny a
"phenomenal business."
   Sunbeam and Oster, he says, are still respected brand
names and dominant in certain markets such as food processors
and hand mixers. Those appliances, along with gas grills,
electric blankets and lawn furniture operations, generate $80
million to $100 million in cash flow a year. They also
displayed remarkable resiliency in the face of a bitter
bankruptcy. Indeed, retailers and distributors say the only
problem of late is getting enough product.
   A strategic priority, Mr. Kazarian says, will be to spread
the Oster and Sunbeam brand names globally. "The managers and
presidents are like racehorses in the starting block," he
says. "They're saying we've got a great product. We have to
give them money to communicate that." He plans on using some
of the $300 million in fresh equity to tap the European
market.
   Mr. Kazarian and his new management team may have their
work cut out for them, though. Analyst Gregory Drahuschak of
Butcher &amp; Singer Inc. says the new company needs to restore
the luster to the Sunbeam brand name, which hasn't been
heavily promoted in recent years and has lost some of its
quality reputation. "It would be a mistake to cut costs by
slashing advertising," he says. "He needs to win back market
share and competitors won't let it go without a fight."
   If nothing else, Mr. Kazarian has done his homework,
associates say. "He's not a powder puff," asserts former
Allegheny director Joshua Angel. "If he brings the same sense
of purpose to running the company as he did to acquiring it,
my guess is he will be a success."
   Adds Melvin Gardner, another former Allegheny director:
"These guys are entrepreneurs who have their money at stake.
That's very important."
   Mr. Kazarian says he won't be involved in the daily
operations. While the Pittsburgh headquarters staff will be
largely dismissed, presidents of the two main operating units
-- home appliances and seasonal products such as lawn
furniture -- will remain and report directly to Mr. Kazarian.
He believes in employee ownership and as such said all
employees will have a chance to buy equity in the company,
which is expected to be 90%-owned by Japonica.
   The new chairman is a clear departure from the more staid
style of Oliver S. Travers, Allegheny's silver-haired
chairman known for his gentlemanly manner. Mr. Kazarian "has
a relatively informal style," says Herbert P. Minkel Jr., who
represented Japonica in the bankruptcy proceedings. "Paul
gets a certain amount of pleasure out of making life a little
uncomfortable for members of the establishment."
   After accumulating a 50% interest in Allegheny, the group
demanded Mr. Travers's resignation in June, a move which so
incensed the company that it kicked Japonica out of company
headquarters where the group was studying the company's
books.
   Yet while informal, associates say Mr. Kazarian is a
stickler for detail. "He plans things down to the hour. When
you work with Paul you know exactly what you have to deliver
and when," says Mr. Minkel.
   Being an outsider with a fresh outlook and unencumbered by
industry conventions may be a plus for Mr. Kazarian and the
company.
   But it also means he has to convince nervous retailer and
skeptical employees that he's interested in a long-term
relationship and not a fast buck. One show of his commitment:
not only is he keeping the company's lean headquarters in
Pittsburgh, but he, his wife and four children are moving
there from New York.

   Your July 30 Politics &amp; Policy article "New Jersey's
Florio Has Won Battles but Faces Tax Revolt, Loss of
Assembly" quoted Stephen Salmore opining on the loss of Gov.
Florio's credibility, and it identifies Mr. Salmore as a
political scientist at Rutgers University. Mr. Salmore is on
the Rutgers faculty, but he also is a paid adviser to
Republican candidates. Recently, he conducted a seminar for
local Republican nominees, advising them on strategies to
counter Gov. Florio.
   Had your reporter known about this connection, he might
not have given as much credence to Mr. Salmore's "spin." In
any case, it is a fact that readers might find helpful.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Florio has proposed fair, honest answers for the
serious budget problems he inherited. He has enacted a reform
of our state's tax system that will ease the burden of high
property taxes on the middle class. While policy
disagreements and analysis are a welcome part of the process,
politically motivated statements masquerading as objective
commentary should be put in perspective.

   Sears's Glitzy Ads Target
   Buyers of Stylish Fashions

   Fashion magazines are known for their alluring
advertising. Just flip through the August issue of Vogue.
There's a provocative four-page spread for Georges Marciano,
a sultry ad for Capezio bags, Mario Valentino's seductive
appeal and a pouty-lipped model in an ad for Sears, Roebuck &amp;
Co.
   Sears?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yup. And it's no mistake.
   It's all part of a new shock 'em strategy by the drudge of
retailing. Sears wants to grab the attention of women who
wouldn't be caught dead in its women's apparel department.
   Besides Vogue and Glamour magazines, Sears plans to hype
its new look this fall in other women's magazines, notably
Cosmopolitan, Mademoiselle and Essence.
   This month's Vogue ad introduces an inexpensive sportswear
collection designed for Sears by Cathy Hardwick, once a
common fixture in department stores. Although the Sears ad
isn't as sexy or sophisticated as the Vogue spreads for
Bergdorf Goodman, Macy's or Nordstrom, it's a far cry from
the typical -- and lifeless -- Sears layout. The message: The
giant retailer now sells stylish clothes.
   Sears also will be the sole sponsor of a special issue on
women that Time magazine plans to publish in October. In 28
pages of ads, Sears will promote women's apparel -- and other
things, like its Allstate insurance policies. But Thomas E.
Morris, vice president of marketing at Sears, says: "We're
not hard-selling product. It is our hope that people reading
the issue will say, `Sears understands my life -- how busy I
am -- and they're responding to it.'"
   Sears needs to attract this younger, more affluent
shopper. Its own research shows that its departments appeal
to the over-40 crowd with annual household incomes of less
than $30,000. To change that profile, Sears is updating its
selection and renovating its stores. The plan has been in the
works for some time and doesn't reflect Sears Chairman Edward
Brennan's new campaign to improve the retailer's
merchandising operations.
   But Sears, which suddenly views fashion as a way to
reverse years of market-share losses and sagging earnings,
faces a tough sell. It built its reputation hawking hard
goods like Kenmore appliances, Craftsman tools and DieHard
batteries mostly to men.
   Even people in the Sears camp acknowledge the challenge.
"Sears announcing by itself that it has stylish clothes
doesn't achieve credibility," says Bruce Beach, a managing
director of WPP Group PLC's Ogilvy &amp; Mather unit, which is
handling the Sears ads. But, he says, spreads in magazines
like Vogue and Time will "force people to think differently
about the kinds of fashion that are available at Sears."
   J.C. Penney Co., a mass merchant that spent the past
decade shedding hard goods to focus on fashion, also started
advertising in Vogue to achieve credibility. But skeptics say
Vogue may be too much of a stretch for Sears.
   Ayer Inc.'s Thomas Hooke, who handles the Penney account,
says Sears's fashion statement could further confuse
consumers about the store's strategy. He contends that recent
Sears ads have sent "a lot of mixed and crossed signals" by
touting everything from "everyday low pricing" to national
brands in areas like appliances. "The consumer sees Sears
with one set of eyes," he says. "They don't differentiate by
department."
   Agrees Clive Chajet, chairman of image consultant
Lippincott &amp; Margulies in New York: "There are so many other
Sears messages going out that are contradictory to a fashion
image." The Vogue audience, he believes, is probably too
upscale for Sears.
   But Ogilvy's Mr. Beach defends the strategy, noting that
Sears "isn't trying to imitate the Lord &amp; Taylors and Neiman
Marcuses of the world," nor is it trying to attract "the
purchaser of French first-run fashions." The target audience?
"People who are in the market to purchase stylish
contemporary but good-value clothes."
   Read that cheap. Unlike the $300 threads Saks Fifth Avenue
advertises in the current issue of Vogue, Sears is hawking
Hardwick pieces priced from $26 to $64. Insiders say the
retailer seeks to create a Gap-like appeal. It wants shoppers
to think of Sears as a place to buy low-priced but stylish
basics. Yet skeptics point out that Gap Inc. succeeds partly
because it sells only clothes.
   Still, Sears was emboldened by the results of its first
major effort last year to target women. The retailer hired an
actress who appears to be in her 30s to make its corporate
pitch on TV. In the commercials, she talks frankly about why
she likes Sears auto and appliance repair services and credit
and return policies, among other things.
   "We've gotten a tremendous amount of consumer feedback
from these spots," says Sears's Mr. Morris. "It's all
positive."

Scali McCabe Sloves, a unit of WPP Group, formerly handled
the account. P&amp;G, which acquired the brands in July from

   STARKIST TOPS VNRs: More than 81 million TV viewers saw
footage from StarKist's "Dolphin-Safe Tuna" PR video, making
it the most-watched video news release for the first half of
1990. The StarKist release topped the previous record of 80
million viewers for a Drexel Burnham Lambert VNR in 1988,
according to Medialink, a Video Broadcasting Corp. unit that
transmits the releases to TV stations.
                                                                                                       

   READ THEIR LIPS: A new print campaign for Smirnoff vodka,
picking up on President Bush's now-broken campaign pledge,
asks consumers to "Read Your Lips." "One sip will tell it
all," say the ads, created by McCann-Erickson for the
Heublein Inc. brand. "And that's a promise not subject to
change."

   Your July 25 page-one story regarding the self-delusion
home sellers are inflicting upon themselves serves as a
lesson for many in today's post-boom marketplace.
   An unrealistic price set for a home only points to the
seller's naivete and the broker's unwillingness to do his
job: counsel the client to recognize what the market will
bear. The worst advice is to set a high price "and see what
happens." What usually occurs -- as evidenced by the case
study of the folks in Rye, N.Y. -- is that the property
doesn't sell, the asking price is continually "adjusted," all
parties involved get fed up and, worse, the property is
stigmatized. Who wants to admit to buying something that's
been knocked around and passed up by half the world?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An owner has the privilege of setting any price he wishes.
But it's important to measure the benefits of a lower price
that may lead to a quick sale and lessen the risk that the
property will become corrupted by an unrealistic view of what
the true value is. It's never been more appropriate to return
to the time-honored rule that "it's only worth what someone
will pay for it."

   U.S. Alliance With Arabs May Pose Problems
   For Israel, Put Focus on Palestinian Problem

   WASHINGTON -- The international showdown with Iraq, so far
largely a boon to Israel, may well generate some problems for
the Jewish state in the long run.
   The crisis has strengthened dramatically the bonds between
the U.S. and moderate Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia
and Egypt, a trend that always makes Israelis wonder about
America's devotion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   More important, the U.S. now is likely to feel more
obliged to heed those Arab states' pleas to do something
about the Palestinian problem. Saudi and Egyptian leaders are
sure to argue that their survival in the Arab world is
imperiled unless they can demonstrate that their American
friends aren't concerned only about guarding oil fields with
jet fighters but also about solving Arabs' broader political
grievances using diplomacy.
   And that could translate into more pressure on Israel for
negotiations over the fate of Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   "Part of the due bill is going to be the desire of those
Arab states we're working with to do something on the
Palestinian question," says Robert Hunter, a National
Security Council adviser on the Middle East under the Carter
administration who is now an analyst at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
   And if the focus does shift toward the Palestinian issue
when the dust settles, arguments now being used by the Bush
administration to oppose Iraq's invasion of Kuwait may well
cut politically against Israel. "If the U.S. opposes the
acquisition of territory by Iraq, it may very well be pushed
over time to do more about Israel's occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza," says Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.) chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East.
   Sen. William Cohen (R., Me.), ranking Republican on the
Senate Intelligence Committee, says "the immediate impact is
a positive one for Israel, but in the long run, you're likely
to see a unified Arab effort to bring the focus back to the
issue of annexation, including Israel's occupation of Arab
land." Sen. Cohen also says rising oil prices could focus
U.S. anger on Israel, and the Arabs could press for a Mideast
nuclear arms-control treaty.
   And beyond politics, of course, there remains the distinct
risk that Iraq may choose to draw attention away from its
occupation of Kuwait by launching an attack on Israel,
forcing Israel into a fight that could expand into a broad
war with the Arab world.
   For the time being, though, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is
handing Israel clear short-term political benefits. It has
diverted world attention from the search for a solution to
the Palestinian problem -- a search that was creating growing
friction between Israel and the U.S. And the Iraqi move has
added credence to Israel's longstanding assertion that it is
a stable U.S. ally stuck in a "dangerous neighborhood," Rep.
Hamilton says.
   There are likely to be some long-term benefits for the
Jewish state as well. Israel is proving its worth with a
steady stream of intelligence for the U.S., which could earn
President Bush's gratitude. And no matter what the outcome,
the Iraqi invasion has cooled the U.S. attraction to
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, who
has strongly backed Iraq. Some think these benefits will make
the Iraqi move a net plus for Israel, even after the dust
settles. "One of the things it has done in this country is
remind people of the instability of the Arab world and
therefore the strategic importance of Israel," says Greg
Schneiders, a Democratic consultant and pollster.
   "We have really been the preachers about this Iraqi danger
for the past 18 months," Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad said
in an interview. He and other Israeli diplomats here feel
comfortable with Israel's low-profile role; the ambassador
has seen Secretary of State James Baker twice this week
already.
   But there are a couple of potential flashpoints that could
have Israel and the U.S. at odds soon, with Israel sorely
tempted to raise its profile in the conflict -- against U.S.
wishes.
   First, Saddam Hussein could "Israelify" his fight by
moving even a token number of tanks or warplanes into Jordan,
which separates Iraq from Israel. Israeli leaders have
repeatedly warned, even before Iraq invaded Kuwait, that the
entry of Iraqi forces into Jordan would be a "causus belli,"
an act that would trigger an Israeli strike at Iraq, Jordan
or their forces.
   Israel's Air Force commander recently warned both Iraq and
Jordan that such a move would be "playing with fire."
Israel's leaders consider having Iraqi forces in Jordan
unacceptable because they would be in a position for a quick
strike at Israel.
   One Israeli official says bluntly that "we want to stay
out of it, but once highly important security interests of
Israel are in danger, I don't think anyone would expect us to
stand by."
   President Bush might be distinctly unhappy with any
Israeli military strike, which could widen or deepen the
conflict and color it as a joint U.S.-Israeli assault on
Arabs. But Israel's hard-line government rarely backs off
when it is convinced the Jewish state's very survival is on
the line.
   Saddam Hussein might also draw Israel into the conflict
with more limited or ambiguous moves. For instance, he could
send non-combat support units into Jordan, or terrorists into
Israel itself. If Israel reacted to such lesser moves by
hitting Iraq or Jordan, the Arab anger and U.S. irritation
might be even worse.
   The second potential for Israeli involvement concerns
Iraq's growing complex of plants and laboratories dedicated
to producing ballistic missiles and the chemical and nuclear
warheads they would carry. Israel has been itching to destroy
these buildings and might use any pretext to do so --
including a threatening Iraqi move far from its borders.
   The U.S. also sees elimination of the Iraqi
advanced-weapons industry as one goal of its current
confrontation. But the Pentagon might prefer to do the job
itself, in its own way and at a time of its own choosing,
rather than have Israel repeat the daring 1981 air strike
that shattered Iraq's former nuclear-weapons research center.
   But even if the standoff with Iraq ends peacefully, there
could be complications for Israel. For starters, Saudi
Arabia's decision to invite tens of thousands of heavily
armed U.S. troops to guard the kingdom and Egypt's related
move to organize an Arab military force undercut contentions
by Israel's supporters that moderate Arabs would shy away
from teaming up openly with the U.S. in a Middle East crisis.
   "At first, the Israeli government could take some
satisfaction in these events," says Samuel Lewis, a former
U.S. ambassador to Israel. "But the demonstration of our
strategic links to the gulf countries undermines the
longstanding Israeli argument that none of our Arab
connections would ever be useful if they were needed."
   And regardless of whether Iraq or the U.S. prevails in the
current showdown, the focus seems likely to shift to the
Palestinian question eventually. If Saddam Hussein emerges
unscathed, he clearly wants to be seen as undisputed leader
of the Arab world and as champion of the Palestinian cause.
Rather than dealing with a moderate over the Palestinian
issue, then, Israel would find itself facing the Arab world's
toughest operator. "I think now he'll be more active and
energetic on the Arab-Israeli peace issue because he sees
himself as the Arab leader," says Richard Murphy, former
assistant secretary of state for the Middle East. "They {the
Israelis} might come to regret not being further ahead" in
the peace process.
   And even if the U.S. forces Iraq to back down, the Bush
administration will be under pressure to alleviate Arab
disquiet over the huge U.S. military presence in the Persian
Gulf by moving on the Arab-Israeli peace issue. "We will be
under some pressure to demonstrate that friendship with the
U.S. for a moderate Arab government pays off with a revival
of the peace process as well as checking Saddam Hussein's
ambitions," says William Quandt, a former National Security
Council analyst now with the Brookings Institution.

   Jordan's King Hussein to Arrive Today
   For a Conference With Bush Tomorrow

   WASHINGTON -- Jordan's King Hussein arrives in the U.S.
today for a meeting with President Bush, bringing hope of a
possible diplomatic solution to the Middle East crisis. At
the same time, the president said the U.S. may use its
warships to shut down Iraqi trade through Jordan.
   The two developments signaled the pivotal role that Jordan
and its king are suddenly playing in the crisis touched off
by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week. Jordan could give
Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein his best hope -- perhaps his
only hope -- of opening a loophole in a global trade embargo
against Iraq. At the same time, the Jordanian monarch could
give the U.S. a path to Saddam Hussein at a time when the
fate of Americans and other foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait
remains in doubt.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In another sign that Iraq may be attempting to send
signals to the U.S., ABC-TV newsman Ted Koppel was allowed
into Bagdhad and said he was told by a senior Iraqi foreign
ministry official that Jordan's King Hussein will be carrying
a message from Saddam Hussein that time remains to discuss an
end to the confrontation.
   Mr. Koppel said the Iraqi official termed Americans stuck
in Iraq and Kuwait as "restrictees" who won't be permitted to
leave until the current crisis ends.
   With its location between Iraq and the Red Sea, Jordan and
its port city of Aqaba have assumed critical strategic
significance. "If it's a hole through which commerce flows in
an otherwise tight net, I would certainly think that Aqaba
should be closed to Iraq commerce," President Bush said at a
news conference.
   He indicated that the U.S. is ready to press its
"interdiction" of Iraqi trade -- but that the U.S. is
continuing to talk to other countries, including the Soviet
Union, seeking further multinational backing to strengthen
such a move. "I think the world wants to see these . . . .
sanctions carried out," he said.
   The Soviet Union let it be known yesterday that it might
join the U.S. and other nations moving to block trade with
Iraq if the venture could be accomplished under the control
of a little-known United Nations body called the Military
Staff Committee.
   Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt called in the
British, French, Soviet and Chinese ambassadors to confer on
the proposal. Asked about it, President Bush said: "I don't
have any problem talking to the Soviets about that," adding:
"It would be a very good thing to have an active Soviet
presence." However, he said he believed it was not essential
that the plan occur under U.N. auspices.
   At the same time he was warning of a possible interdiction
of shipping through Jordan, Mr. Bush yesterday held out the
enticement of aid to Jordan, should King Hussein choose
voluntarily to shut down commerce with Iraq. "We've helped
them in the past," Mr. Bush said, adding: "We'd help them in
the future -- if they fulfill their obligations here."
   Although King Hussein is reportedly carrying a message to
President Bush from Saddam Hussein, President Bush said that
the Jordanian leader had telephoned him seeking only to
confer about the "whole situation." The meeting is scheduled
tomorrow, at President Bush's summer home in Kennebunkport,
Maine.
   The king's shuttle mission between Baghdad and Washington
-- undoubtedly the most delicate mission in his 37-year reign
-- illustrates his strategic dilemma. Caught between Iraq and
the West, he is desperately trying to satisfy both sides.
   "It's important to keep lines of communication open," says
William Quandt, a former National Security Council Middle
East analyst now at the Brookings Institution. And King
Hussein may be a particularly energetic mediator, Mr. Quandt
says, because "he probably more than anybody else hopes it's
over soon."
   Jordan has grown dependent on Iraq both economically and
politically. It relies on Iraq for almost all its oil and for
the big fees it has earned for shipping in Iraqi goods. And
as the influx of Soviet Jews and the introduction of a
right-wing government in Israel threatens to push more and
more Palestinians into Jordan, King Hussein has come to rely
on Iraq more and more for protection from Israel.
   Just as important, King Hussein couldn't repudiate the
Iraqi president without jeopardizing his country's internal
stability. The Hashemite monarch is presiding over a country
whose population is about 60% Palestinian, and Palestinians
are among the most vocal in support of Saddam Hussein for
standing up for Arab interests.
   "Here we are blaming him for listening to his
constituency," says Richard Murphy, a former Mideast envoy
for President Reagan. "The king has opened up politically and
he has to watch his step politically for internal reasons."
   King Hussein himself has helped create broad public
sympathy in Jordan for Iraq and for Saddam Hussein. Jordan
sided strongly with Iraq during its eight-year war with Iran.
Now Saddam Hussein is viewed as a kind of folk hero among
many Jordanians -- particularly among the heavy Palestinian
population in Jordan, which considers him an Arab leader with
the will to solve the Palestinian plight.
   Either now or later, Jordan also must fear retaliation
from powerful Iraq if it turns against Saddam Hussein.
   Some trade leakage through Jordan was evident yesterday.
An Associated Press photographer observed oil-carrying trucks
crossing the border into Jordan every three or four minutes,
although trucks could transport only a small fraction of
Iraq's production capacity.
   To the delight of U.S. officials, Aqaba, a seaport through
which Jordan ships vital goods, had grown quiet yesterday.
According to Pentagon officials, the U.S. Navy was closely
watching traffic into the seaport and observed that it had
dropped off sharply in the past few days. A few cargo vessels
appeared to be waiting outside the port for further
instructions from their owners.
   The Navy was also in a kind of waiting game. "No commander
is going to take action until clear-cut guidelines are sent
from Washington," said one official, who asked not to be
identified.
   Even a partial blockade of Jordan's export-import traffic
could be devastating, according to those familiar with that
country's fragile economy. "Forty-five percent of Jordan's
trade, in terms of hard currencies, comes from Iraq," says
Jean AbiNader, president of the National U.S.-Arab Chamber of
Commerce, a Washington-based association of U.S. companies
that do business in the Arab world.
   During the past ten years, he explains, Jordan's economy
has become closely tuned to Iraq's needs, primarily because
of the Iraq-Iran war, which left the overland route to Aqaba
as Iraq's major supply line. By itself, Mr. AbiNader says,
Jordan has only tourism, the sale of potash and remittances
from Jordanians working abroad on which to rely. Iraq's need
for an export-import pipeline, he says, provided Jordan with
a new financial base in which it has come to depend.
   Mr. AbiNader worries that if the U.S. insists on a total
embargo including food and medicine it could "react
negatively against the U.S." The U.S., he says, "has taken a
tougher line than is necessary to maintain international
support."
   He and other Arab-Americans fret that any false step by
King Hussein in his diplomatic effort, one that could make
him appear too pro-U.S. or too pro-Iraqi, could mean his
downfall in a country already roiled by partisan and ethnic
strife.
   James Zogby, director of the Arab-American Institute, a
Washington-based advocacy group, notes that Jordan, along
with Kuwait, are the most democracy-prone Arab nations. "The
tragedy here is that the two countries that have provided the
most pluralism and the most internal debate are the two chief
victims of this process."

   So now it is the omniscient beanies who are at fault for
our lag with the Japanese and Germans ("The Techies'
Challenge to the Bean Counters," Manager's Journal, July 16,
by Donald N. Frey). The trouble with Mr. Frey's counsel is
that he believes the chief executive officer, the man at the
top, will make a business successful by his own knowledge. I
doubt that is the key to success in today's business world.
More than likely the revitalization of the heavy-machinery
company, where Mr. Frey was a member of the board, is because
the new CEO is aware of the gains that are made when you
harmonize skills and practice the art of listening.
   Give me that sort of leader and it won't make much
difference whether he is an auto mechanic, bean counter or
rocket scientist. The key is to surround yourself with
knowledgeable people, make some effort to see that they have
diverse backgrounds and be sure they know they are on the
team.

   My belief is that the current president of Ford Automotive
Group, Allan Gilmour, knows one helluva a lot about working
with people even though most of his career and background,
including MBA, Harvard, is as a "bean counter." Anyone who
says "financial control and measurement is all (he) know(s)"
doesn't know diddly. If you are going to run articles such as
Mr. Frey's, at least change the heading from the "Manager's
Journal" to the "Archaic Manager's Journal."

   Bravo to Mr. Frey for enunciating one of the most
important problems in America today. Thankfully, he does not
succumb to the common misconception that we lack quality
engineering and scientific manpower compared with the
Japanese and the Germans. In fact, our engineering and
scientific base is second to none. What we lack is a high
level of technological literacy in the general population --
including most business executives and political leaders.
Because of this, our scientific/engineering class is
essentially disenfranchised -- it has nowhere near the
influence it should have in business and political decisions.
This situation could lead to our inexorable decline as a
first-rate economic power.
   What we need is full-scale cultural change, and nothing
less. Increased technical capabilities will be required not
only of CEOs but of politicians, lawyers and the general
population.

   Mr. Frey's arbitrary classification of "techies" and
"beanies" is false. More than a quarter of the 1990 MBA crop
have engineering or technical backgrounds. Obviously, these
former techies didn't buy the premise that they were "fast
becoming excellent businessmen" while working in a technical
capacity like Mr. Frey's "competent engineer." On the other
hand, to the lasting benefit of corporate America, "financial
types" don't believe that "financial control and measurement
is all they (will ever) know" or that their only hope of
acquiring even a rudimentary understanding of technology will
be through a techie interpreter.
   The steady influx of corporate-sponsored German and
Japanese students to U.S. business schools demonstrates that
foreign companies recognize these beanie academies are
providing something of value. Fortunately for the financial
staff at Bell and Howell, even Mr. Frey "eventually
concluded" that the beanies did "have the company's best
interests at heart." Otherwise, we can only assume mass
dismissals would have been his sole recourse.
   By the way, the preferred form of address is beaner, not
beanie.

   Mr. Frey puts his finger on an endemic problem in American
industry. I would underscore the "essential characteristics."
Having worked in two major industrial settings in which
strong technical people served as CEOs, I found that the
best-laid plans can fail when:
   -- The CEO never learns to speak in anything but technical
jargon; indeed, takes glee in leaving his or her
non-technical people in the semantic dust.
   -- The CEO uses emerging technology to leverage a return
to old, comfortable products and lines of business well after
they are moribund.
   -- The CEO not only does not network into the nontechnical
company sector, he or she openly disdains "non-techies" for
their lack of "insight."
   -- The CEO was elevated to his or her position on the
basis of technological performance, by "techies," who hold
him accountable as a CEO more on science than on the "bottom
line" -- until it is too late. They may have never put new
technology successfully into practice.
   In many cases they may have done so unsuccessfully, but
were rewarded nonetheless. The landscape of corporate
technology is littered with executives who were rewarded for
winning a program that virtually bankrupted the company
later.

   AIDS Study Confirms Increased Risk
   Of Lymphoma for Long-Term Patients

   Despite better medical treatment to fight life-threatening
infections, a study confirmed that long-term AIDS survivors
face increased risk of developing lymph cancer.
   In the first study published on the problem, reported
earlier this year, scientists at the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md., said that eight of 55 patients,
or almost 15%, developed an aggressive lymphoma following
about two years of therapy with the anti-viral drug AZT.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After three years of AZT treatment, the risk of developing
such cancer may exceed 46%, making lymphoma "a formidable
complication" of the AIDS epidemic now entering its second
decade, wrote the lead author of the report, Dr. James Pluda
of the NCI. The study is published in today's issue of the
Annals of Internal Medicine.
   In Research Triangle Park, N.C., a spokeswoman for the
drug's manufacturer, Burroughs Wellcome Co., a unit of
Wellcome PLC of London, said that "nothing in the clinical
trials suggests that the rate of lymphoma was any different
in AZT recipients than in the control group" who received a
placebo, or sugar pill. Moreover, she said, "AIDS patients
are generally at risk for lymphoma."
   Many experts emphasized that the syndrome is evolving, and
presenting new challenges to researchers and clinicians
alike.
   Laurence Kaplan of San Francisco General Hospital, who saw
four new cases of lymphoma yesterday alone, said the new
manifestations of AIDS arise because "We're seeing people
living longer."
   "As therapies are developed, we can expect to see a
changing face of AIDS," added Clifford Lane, an AIDS
researcher at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases. "As we develop treatments for one
complication, another complication arises."
   While the precise cause of the cancer remains a mystery,
scientists at NCI and elsewhere currently are investigating
the potential role of AZT, earlier linked to vaginal tumors
in laboratory animals. Doctors also have noted genetic
abnormalities, specifically changes in chromosome numbers 8
and 14, affecting as many as 85% of such AIDS lymphoma
patients, according to Jerome Groopman of the New England
Deaconess Hospital, who has seen 40 cases of lymphoma in his
clinic in the past year.
   Further, a majority of such patients show high activity of
a cancer-causing gene, or oncogene, named "myc", Dr. Groopman
adds. Finally, up to half such AIDS lymphomas show signs of a
second virus, Epstein-Barr virus, long ago implicated in
Burkitt's lymphoma, a variety of lymphoma that is prevalent
in Africa.
   The surge in AIDS-related lymphoma isn't occuring in a
vaccuum, however, as the disease is generally on the rise.
For unknown reasons, the incidence of lymphoma in the U.S.
has increased 50% since 1973, NCI surveillance studies have
reported.
   Especially vulnerable is anyone with weakened immunity,
including patients with hereditary immune deficiencies, and
organ transplant recipients, as well as people with AIDS.
This type of cancer, formally known as non-Hodgkins lymphoma,
is a malignancy of B-cells, the antibody-producing white
blood cells, which proliferate wildly in AIDS patients even
as their immune defenses erode.
   For this reason, the authors of the report strongly
suggest that longer-term AIDS survivors are at greater risk
of lymphoma because they live longer with severely weakened
immunity, giving cancer an open door into the system. Indeed,
the people in the study group were profoundly immune
suppressed, with levels of infection-fighting T4 cells below
50 per cubic millimeter for more than a year preceding the
onset of cancer. (Normal T4 cell counts generally are thought
to be at least 1,000 per cubic millimeter.)
   "However, a direct role of therapy itself cannot be
totally discounted," the report acknowledges. Not just AZT,
but other potent drugs used in treating the complications of
AIDS, may contribute to genetic mutations that lead to
cancer. These include DHPG and trimethoprim sulfa, according
Dr. Groopman, who adds, "We need a lot of lab study to learn
how lymphoma arises in a setting of immune deficiency."
   In the future, combination therapies, or treatment
regimens that include biological agents to bolster the immune
system, may allay the plunge in T4 counts and gird AIDS
patients against such malignancies, said Samuel Broder, NCI
director and a co-author of the report. Discovering the
molecular basis of lymphoma, and finding better treatment for
it, are now "major priorities" of the institute, he added.
   But for now, neither the report's authors nor outside
experts are counseling any wholesale shift in AIDS treatment
strategy until much more is known. "AZT is clearly the drug
of choice for most AIDS patients. So I wouldn't change
anyone's medications at this point," said Dr. Groopman. "But
I would study AZT's role as a mutagen."

   Several Thrift Officers and Directors
   Have Increased Their Stock Holdings

   NEW YORK -- There are some bulls working in the
beleaguered thrift industry.
   Officers, directors and major shareholders at several
savings banks and savings and loan associations have
substantially increased their holdings of their companies'
shares, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since May 1, the number of insiders buying thrift stocks
has outnumbered sellers three to one, according to the SEC
filings. All told, insiders at 65 out of 201 publicly traded
thrifts have bought shares in roughly the past three months,
according to Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., company that
tracks and analyzes SEC insider filings.
   Thrift stocks have been hit hard in recent months by the
well-publicized S&amp;L debacle. And tensions in the Middle East,
sparking fears of recession and higher interest rates, have
driven thrift stock prices down further. Since Dec. 31, the
sector as a whole has fallen almost 18%.
   "Whenever you have a whole group {of stocks} come down,
the fall takes the good ones and the bad ones together," said
Robert Gabele, president of Invest/Net. But bargain-hunting
investors tempted to follow the example of thrift-industry
insiders should use caution: Historically, these insiders
haven't tended to be great market timers, Mr. Gabele said.
   Indeed, several of the thrift-industry insiders who have
bought in recent months have lost money on the purchases, at
least on paper.
   Investors who are selectively bullish on thrifts argue
that, while recession is still only a possibility, there have
already been actual economic changes that have benefited the
thrift industry. Long-term interest rates have risen more
steeply than short-term rates, which is positive for the
industry because thrifts fund their operations with
short-term money, but generally lend longer term, said Nick
Adams, portfolio manager of First Financial Fund, which
invests in thrift issues.
   Moreover, prices of thrift-industry stocks already have
the worst-case scenario built into them, leaving them to some
degree insulated from further stock market debacles, some
bullish money managers said.
   One of the largest recent purchases by a thrift insider
was made by David Himick, a director of Heritage Bankcorp. in
Taylor, Mich. He bought 32,300 shares in April and June, just
about doubling his holdings. He paid an average of $9.32 a
share, or $301,036.
   "Because of the publicity of the failing S&amp;Ls and their
problems," Heritage Bankcorp. stock has fallen drastically,
said Mr. Himick. The stock, which reached a high of $14.50 a
share last year, closed yesterday in national
over-the-counter trading at $7.875, unchanged.
   Mr. Himick said he's attempting to acquire a 5% stake in
the thrift because "it's very profitable," has complied with
all regulatory requirements, and its management is "very
frugal, very lean as far as expense accounts." Mr. Himick
added that he purchased an additional 6,500 shares in July
that aren't yet reflected in SEC filings.
   James Large, chairman of Anchor Savings Bank, increased
his holdings in the New York City thrift by 24% in May, with
the purchase of 5,000 shares, SEC filings show. He paid $1.94
a share.
   Mr. Large said he's been buying the thrift's shares
regularly because he believes it is in a turnaround
situation. "Anchor was a thrift that was short on capital and
losing money," he said. But now, as a result of a corporate
fix-it effort, "it's humming along awfully nicely."
   He said the thrift has trimmed staff to 1,875 from 2,500
employees in the past two years, has "peeled off all of our
assets not central" to the primary business of lending money,
and will have enough capital to meet federal regulatory
requirements by next year.
   In its fourth quarter ended June 30, Anchor had net income
of $2.15 a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of
$1.75 a share, reflecting gains from asset sales plus
improved operations. Yesterday, the stock closed at $1.375,
down 6.25 cents, in over-the-counter trading.
   At Greater New York Savings Bank, the chairman and four
directors increased their holdings in May by a total of
51,147 shares, according to SEC filings. Insiders at the New
York thrift paid an average price of $8.03 a share, or a
total of $410,710. The largest purchase was made by director
Philip Ruppel, who bought 24,100 shares, increasing his total
direct and indirect holdings 47%, SEC filings show. Charles
Ohlig, chairman, purchased 347 shares, bringing his holdings
to 12,808 shares, according to filings. Messrs. Ohlig and
Ruppel declined to comment.
   In over-the-counter trading, the shares of Greater New
York closed at $4, up 12.5 cents, yesterday.
   As previously reported, Nathaniel Gross, president of Bell
Savings Holdings Inc. of Upper Darby, Pa., purchased 75,000
shares at $1.50 a share on July 12. The $112,500 purchase
increased his holdings 47%. In over-the-counter trading, the
shares of Bell Savings closed at $1.875, down 25 cents,
yesterday.
   Three other insiders at Bell Savings who bought shares in
the thrift earlier haven't been so fortunate. The three paid
an average of $3.08 a share in April and May for 4,100
shares, SEC filings show.

   LONDON -- The Lloyd's of London War Risks Rating Committee
has recommended sharply higher rates to insure cargoes being
transported to or from Jordan.
   A spokesman for the Institute of Underwriters said this
was because Jordan had become the only conduit for goods
moving into or out of Iraq, since the imposition of a United
Nations embargo on trade with Iraq and Kuwait.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Before the announcement by the War Risks Rating Committee,
insuring a cargo moving to Jordan by marine craft against war
risks cost 0.0275% of the insured value. The same insurance
will now cost almost four times more, or 0.1% of the insured
value.
   The cost of insuring air cargoes to or from Jordan has
risen by about the same rate to 0.075% of the insured value,
from 0.02% previously.
   The committee also recommended changes in the schedule for
cargoes moving through Saudi Arabian ports or places from
Dammam north.
   Whereas rates for Saudi Arabian Gulf ports or places were
previously "held covered," or decided by underwriters based
on individual voyages, insurance for cargoes being
transported by marine craft to or from these ports against
war risks will now cost 0.5% of the insured value.
   Insuring cargoes being transported by ship to Saudi ports
or places south of Dammam will now cost 0.05% of the insured
value.
   Insuring air cargoes to or from any part of Saudi Arabia
will now cost 0.075% of the insured value, whereas this area
was previously held covered.

   Brazil's Economic Rebound May Stall
   As Mideast Crisis Spurs Rise in Oil Prices

   RIO DE JANEIRO -- Just as Brazilian President Fernando
Collor de Mello was proclaiming that "the government is
winning the battle against inflation," the rise in oil prices
and threat of a world economic downturn following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait have dashed Brazil's growing mood of
optimism.
   The menace of a new oil shock comes at the worst possible
time for Brazil. Nearly five months into a bold
anti-inflation plan, results were starting to show. Instead,
it faces the possibility of recession and higher inflation,
further complicating Brazil's ability to start repaying its
$112 billion foreign debt, the developing world's largest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Maybe God isn't Brazilian any more," says former central
bank president Carlos Langoni. "The timing of this couldn't
be worse. There was great progress in the past two months in
breaking inflationary expectations, but the program could be
slowed down now." Adds economist Edmar Bacha: "We are in a
very critical phase of the stabilization plan, and {a new oil
shock} could be the difference between getting inflation down
more or keeping it where it is."
   So far -- much to the surprise of many economists and
businessmen -- the anti-inflation policy's results have been
impressive, and government officials say it's too early to
predict they will be derailed by the Middle East conflict. A
few months ago, economists were predicting that the
difficulty of administering the plan's centerpiece, a huge
liquidity squeeze that took two-thirds of the country's money
out of circulation, would plunge Brazil into recession or
back into runaway inflation. In fact, neither has happened.
   "We escaped the risk of a collapse of the economy, deep
recession or a return to hyperinflation and the government is
showing a surprising degree of determination," says Andre
Lara Resende, vice president of Unibanco bank, who was
skeptical at first about the government's austerity measures.
   Inflation, which reached 84.3% in the month preceding the
implementation of the plan, stood at 12.9% in July after the
lifting of most price controls. This has been achieved with
Brazil suffering a drop in gross national product for 1990 of
between 3% and 5% of last year's $370 billion. GNP is the
total value of the goods and services a nation produces.
After falling sharply in the initial months, employment
picked up in June. The government has begun regaining control
of spending and monetary policy and has cut more than 100,000
public sector jobs. And it has so far resisted claims for a
return to wage-price indexation despite a wave of strikes and
looming elections.
   But this bright picture faces challenges in the coming
weeks -- on which events in the Persian Gulf could have a
major bearing. The biggest and most immediate challenge is on
wages. Brazil's Congress is scheduled to vote on Aug. 21
whether to override a presidential veto of a bill
reintroducing wage-price indexation. Although Mr. Collor
warned recently that a return to indexation would bring a
return to hyperinflation or "a brutal recession," some
analysts fear that electoral pressures could lead congressmen
running in the Oct. 3 elections to vote for it. Oil-fed
inflation would make it even more difficult for the
government to resist indexation.
   The pressure certainly is there. For many Brazilians, even
if inflation is lower than before and prices rise more
slowly, life is more expensive because their salaries haven't
followed inflation like they used to. "Collor doesn't go
shopping like I do," says cleaning lady Luiza Gomes Montes.
"Things just get harder and harder." Even the armed forces
have begun grumbling about their pay.
   More than 500 strikes have broken out since the plan was
unveiled. At Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, a state-owned
steel company, workers ended a strike of over one month this
weekend. The government stayed carefully away from the
conflict and won the support of the Supreme Labor Court,
which termed the workers' demands excessive and granted them
only small increases. But Mr. Collor's plan will face new
challenges at collective bargaining negotiations in key
public sector areas during the next few months. Also in the
shortterm, economists say, the government faces inflationary
pressures because of the overvalued cruzeiro that raises the
price of exports.
   A major longer-term challenge is to convince Brazilians --
and foreign creditors -- that the improvement in public
finances that the government boasts of is real and durable.
Economics Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello claims Brazil has
achieved a feat "unparalleled in history," turning a huge
budget deficit last year into a predicted 1.22% surplus this
year. But even this figure raises skepticism. "The government
says it will post a surplus and maybe it will," says former
central bank President Affonso Celso Pastore. "We'll have to
wait and see."
   Whether the surplus is real or not is of crucial interest
to Brazil's foreign creditors, who want Brazil to start
paying its arrears and resume debt negotiations. But Brazil,
which suspended all debt payments last summer, says it won't
threaten its economic growth by resuming payments. Its
position is likely to harden if an international recession
sets in.
   "Debt payments seem to be very low on the priority list,"
says Mr. Lara Resende. At the same time, Brazil is hoping to
obtain a $1.4 billion standby loan from the International
Monetary Fund on the basis of the results it has achieved so
far.

   "To rebuild and run the Hungarian business in which we are
buying a 49% stake," reports the CEO of a Western
consumer-goods company, "we'll need a dozen experienced
Hungarian executives. We had over a hundred applicants, each
appearing well qualified by job title and position. But only
three or four turned out to have the experience and skills
needed."
   Businesses in Central Europe seem to employ at least twice
as many managers and professionals as do comparable
businesses in the West. But there is an extreme scarcity of
managerial skills and experience.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Many Central European managers have received excellent
educations: Central Europe's technical schools have
maintained high standards. But then these people spent their
working lives as paperpushers -- writing regulations or
endless reports or negotiating with the ministry and the
central planners about quotas, production targets, overhead
allocation, prices. Or they made their careers as "fixers":
chasing promised parts that hadn't arrived; scurrying to find
a few extra tons of materials, a little extra food for their
workers or foreign exchange to pay for a machine tool from
abroad.
   In fact, the abler a person was, the more likely he or she
was to be shifted into paperpushing or fixing, and kept
there. The skills needed to make a business perform are not
in great demand in a Stalinist economy. Stalinism knows
record keeping but not cost analysis or cost accounting.
Financial management of any kind is totally absent. But so
are pricing, market research, marketing, product innovation,
product and customer service, quality control. No major
design work on either one of East Germany's two automobiles,
the Trabant and the Wartburg, has been done since the
mid-1960s, 25 years ago.
   Indeed people with experience and skills are so scarce
that Commerzbank, third-largest of West Germany's big banks,
is not even trying to find East Germans for the branches it
is putting into every sizable East German town. It is
staffing them with West German employees who will commute for
18 months or two years until their East German replacements
have been trained. "Our new East German customers expect
competent service," explains one of Commerzbank's top people,
"and that requires a seasoned banker."
   Even two years' training, I suspect, isn't going to
produce an executive seasoned enough to run a regional
banking center in a big industrial city like Leipzig. But
skills can be taught and can be learned. There is furious
skill-learning going on all over Central Europe. Hungary for
instance, has opened an executive management center in
Budapest -- that teaches in English] Skills can sometimes
also be supplied from the outside. The scarcity of people in
Eastern Europe with the needed managerial and professional
skills is a very big problem. But it should be surmountable,
over time at least.
   Infinitely more difficult but also infinitely more
critical will be the needed revolution in the managerial
culture of Central Europe. It means undoing 40 years of wrong
values, wrong incentives and wrong policies.
   For 40 years no one in a Stalinist country has been
permitted to report the truth. An old Soviet story -- going
back to the early years of the Five Year Plans 60 years ago
-- tells of the plant manager who needed an accountant. He
asked each applicant: "How much is two and two?" He gave the
job to the one who answered: "How much do you need it to be,
Comrade Manager?"
   And that's still the right answer, despite "glasnost" and
"perestroika". There is no other explanation for the
near-famine in the Soviet Union today than that last fall's
glowing reports of record harvests were what Moscow "needed
them to be." And the regimes of Central Europe, especially
the hard-liners in East Germany and Czechoslovakia, were even
more economically Stalinist than the Russians, and stayed
Stalinist longer. How can people now be expected to tell the
truth when no one has been able to make a career for 40 years
unless he was willing to lie and to be lied to? But a
functioning economy is based on reliable information and on
reports that can be trusted.
   In a Stalinist system decisions are made at the highest
possible level. This is the essence of a "Plan" (and, of
course, a main reason why centralized planning did not work).
What to make and how much, what the product should look like
and how much it should cost, are all laid down in the Plan.
But so also is the number of people employed, their pay and
their bonuses, their job titles and their promotions. All
this is decided on high with minimum or no input from the
people who then are supposed to carry out the Plan. These
people can sabotage the Plan -- and they do. But they cannot
decide.
   As a result no one is in the habit of decision-making,
trained in it, tested in it. Nothing so much frightens people
in former Communist countries, visitors report, as to be
asked to make a decision. They are paralyzed by the fear of
making a mistake. They hold endless meetings, call for more
and more studies and in the end find a good reason why
someone higher up should take the responsibility. Yet it is
the essence of a market economy -- and its strength -- that
decisions are made close to market and customer, all the way
down to the salesman who decides whether to stop calling on
an unreceptive prospect, and to the supervisor who decides
whether to stop the line to correct a malfunction. This is
almost inconceivable to people who have lived and worked 40
years under a Stalinist regime.
   Central Europe desperately needs middle-sized enterprises.
The greatest opportunities, especially for providing badly
needed new jobs, lie in services and in consumer goods. These
are both areas in which middle-sized, locally managed
businesses flourish. The bankrupt, giant government
businesses can in most cases be salvaged only if broken up
into smaller and more manageable units. If instead they are
"privatized" as they are -- as now strongly advocated by
government people in Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Poland
-- they will simply shift from being unproductive government
monopolies to being unproductive non-government monopolies.
And there would then be no economic turn-around, no
free-market economy, only continued economic stagnation.
   But where will the people come from to manage middle-sized
enterprises? Stalinism can tolerate a farm woman's selling a
few apples off a push cart. It cannot and does not tolerate
middle-sized enterprises. To be effectively controlled,
enterprises must be big and super-big. There is the huge
ministry, employing tens of thousands which centrally runs
all of the country's machine-tool factories. There is the
"Kombinat," only slightly smaller, the large holding company
which centrally runs all the country's clothing factories.
And then there are large conglomerates for which Stalinism
has special affection. The former Bata shoe factory in Zlin
in Central Czechoslovakia -- until World War II the world's
most efficient and most profitable footwear manufacturer --
still makes shoes. But it now also includes a dozen totally
unrelated businesses, including machinery manufacturers and
even an airplane maker.
   Sixty years ago Central Europe was chock-full of the kind
of firms, the Germans call "Mittelstand," that is, successful
middle-sized businesses, usually family-owned and
family-managed. But only a few old people at or past
retirement age even remember them now. The last ones in East
Germany were expropriated more than 30 years ago; in
Czechoslovakia and Hungary, as well as Poland, they were gone
10 years earlier.
   And even if the needed entrepreneurs were to emerge, would
they be allowed to do their work? After 40 years of Stalinist
indoctrination there is deep prejudice against such people.
That they try to make a profit is bad enough. Worse, much
worse, they are independent. And for 40 years independent
people have been virtual outlaws, "They all want capitalism,"
said a Belgian Mittelstand industrialist who had just come
back from a long trip to Hungary and East Germany. "But they
don't want capitalists; they want functionaries."
   There is, finally, an even bigger problem of managerial
culture than any discussed so far: the lack of understanding
of what free enterprise and a market economy are all about.
   An American marketing executive this spring visited the
Czech provincial city in which she had been born and raised
and which she left, 22 years ago, fresh out of college, when
the Russian tanks crushed the "Prague Spring" in 1968. "I was
immediately asked," she reports, "to hold a seminar on
marketing for the top people in the city's five big
factories. I started out by telling them how our company in
the U.S. operates. We have 2500 employees and are number
three in a small but highly competitive and fast-moving
market. I soon realized that I made no sense to my audience.
   "So I stopped and said: `I have the feeling that you
define a competitive market as one in which prices are kept
high enough for every competitor to make a good profit.'
   "`That's exactly right,' they all said. `After all, in a
market economy a business has to make a profit.'
   "`No,' I said, `in a market economy it has to earn a
profit.' And there was a look of utter bewilderment on every
face."
   Very few, if any, people in Central Europe still believe
in communism as a political, a social, an economic or a moral
system. They want political freedom. They want the incomes
and the goods that they know only a market economy can
provide. But do they yet know -- and how could they possibly
know? -- that in a market economy there is no "profit" but
only "profit and loss"; no "reward," but only "risk and
reward"; and that freedom is not just the absence of
restraint but self-discipline and responsibility?

   Steelmaker Pact
   Advances Firm's
   Reorganization

   PITTSBURGH -- Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. reached a
tentative agreement with the United Steelworkers union that
gives workers 11% of the company and paves the way for the
steelmaker to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection.
   The tentative contract reached here represents a victory
for both the company and the union. For the U.S.'s
eighth-largest steelmaker, the pact is the last major hurdle
in its five-year effort to get a reorganization plan
approved. This year, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court said it
wouldn't confirm a reorganization plan unless a labor pact
was ratified with the union and accepted by creditors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The union, for its part, succeeded in patterning the
contract after other accords signed with major steelmakers
last year. Thus, it took another step in its goal to return
to wage parity among all major producers. During the
turbulent 1980s, steelmakers broke with the lockstep wage
patterns that had been the industry's tradition by
negotiating separate settlements.
   The contract is subject to approval of the membership and
the union's International Executive Board, which is scheduled
to vote Monday. A membership vote hasn't yet been scheduled.
The accord has already received the backing of the company's
major creditors. The union negotiated the final terms with a
group led by New York investor Ron LaBow, the company's
largest shareholder and creditor, after the company walked
out of talks Sunday.
   As part of the agreement, union employees, who were
creditors of the bankrupt company, will receive 2.2 million
common shares, representing approximately 11% of the
reorganized company. The stock is payment for the $26.8
million owed employees in an employee investment program.
   Under the contract, union employees will receive an
immediate $1.50-an-hour average wage increase representing
restoration of past wage sacrifices. In addition, they will
receive a 50-cent average hourly wage increase in each of the
next three years, a $3,000 signing bonus and a $500 bonus in
1991. The contract also restores one week of vacation,
vacation bonuses, five holidays, Sunday premium of time and a
half, and incentive rates.
   The terms of the new contract will take effect upon
confirmation of a new plan of reorganization by the
Bankruptcy Court, which is expected to act by the end of
September. The contract will expire March 1, 1994.
   "There's no question that this is a good contract, one
that our members richly deserve after 10 years of
sacrifices," said Andrew "Lefty" Palm, chairman of the
union's negotiating committee. "There is also no question
that the company can well afford this contract."
   Union officials said the wage terms are similar to those
in contracts signed last year by major integrated steelmakers
such as Bethlehem Steel Corp., National Steel Co. and LTV
Steel Corp. LTV is also operating under Chapter 11, in which
a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it works
out a plan to reorganize. The contract also includes new
language, in line with agreements reached last year with
other companies, that severely restricts the contracting out
of work.
   The company and its creditors had balked at many of those
terms, deeming them too rich for a newly reorganized company.
However, creditors apparently decided that the contract would
be less of a financial blow than a strike. The union
threatened to strike tomorrow if negotiations deadlocked.
   The union hopes to use the pattern when approaching the
nation's largest steelmaker, USX Corp., this year in contract
talks. USX has already said it doesn't believe in pattern
contracts and was undoubtedly hoping that Wheeling-Pittsburgh
would negotiate different terms.
   In Wheeling, W.Va., Wheeling-Pittsburgh officials said
they were pleased an agreement had been reached and looked
forward to emerging from bankruptcy-law protection. Once the
company emerges, Vice Chairman D. Leonard Wise is expected to
take over as chief executive officer, succeeding turnaround
specialist William J. Scharffenberger.

   Your July 5 page-one article on plastics recycling is
inaccurate, poorly researched and in my opinion generally
untrue. Millions of pounds a year of plastics are being
recycled currently. A number of plants are on-stream,
processing post-consumer plastics for recycling. New plants
are under construction, including several facilities for
National Polystyrene Recycling Co. to recycle post-consumer
polystyrene.
   The editorialized article presented a sarcastic viewpoint
of plastics recycling with generally incorrect information on
recycling processes and certainly misinformation on
recycled-plastics markets and uses. I cannot believe you have
progressed from business reporting to business bashing for a
significantly large industry.

   General Homes
   Wins Clearance
   For Realignment

   General Homes Corp. obtained a court order allowing the
company to voluntarily reorganize under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, reversing its opposition to an
involuntary reorganization sought last month by three
bondholders.
   The Houston-based homebuilder set the stage for a
voluntary reorganization last week when it obtained a court
order allowing it to pay suppliers and contractors. The order
was a critical step toward preventing unpaid suppliers and
contractors from filing liens to block the sales of homes and
lots.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We are entering this phase in about the best position we
can be in," said General Homes president W.A. LeSage. "There
shouldn't be a disruption in our business."
   As recently as two weeks ago, Mr. LeSage had said General
Homes would seek to dismiss the involuntary Chapter 11
petition filed against the company July 11 by three
bondholders.
   Yesterday, Mr. LeSage said the involuntary reorganization
created "a lot of uncertainty" for the company and that
voluntary reorganization "made a lot of sense."
   "This should be an opportunity to finally restructure this
company," Mr. LeSage said.
   The company had been struggling for three years to
overcome losses on its portfolio of raw land, whose value
plummeted in the Texas real estate depression.
   The Texas real estate market is now showing signs of
recovery, particularly in the Houston area, where most of
General Homes' land holdings are located. The company also
holds real estate in the Dallas-Fort Worth area; Orlando,
Fla.; and Phoenix, Ariz.
   "The land, at this point, is an asset that could bring
value to the company," Mr. LeSage said.
   General Homes currently owes about $225 million to its
senior secured lenders, who hold liens on all of the
company's real estate assets. The principal amount of the
company's subordinated debt is about $140 million.
   The voluntary Chapter 11 petition doesn't affect the
company's units, including a title company and a mortgage
subsidiary, Mr. LeSage said.
   General Homes is represented in the reorganization by the
Houston-based law firm of Sheinfeld, Maley &amp; Kay.

   Stock Prices Edge Up 0.99 Point

   NEW YORK -- Drawing strength from indications that
tensions in the Middle East could be easing, the stock market
bounced back from early weakness and ended higher despite a
late sell-off.
   However, trading was light as skepticism about whether the
Persian Gulf conflict will be resolved anytime soon and
ongoing concerns about its economic impact damped interest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's a little bit early to get excited," said Larry
Greenwald, a block trader at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. The
market's sluggish pace "indicates that people are waiting to
see what the next move is going to be," he said.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which swung within a
trading range of more than 30 points over the course of the
session, closed 0.99 higher at 2747.77.
   Broader measures, which trailed badly Monday as the Dow
Jones industrials advanced 30.20, fared a bit better than the
30-stock measure in the latest session. Standard &amp; Poor's
500-Stock Index gained 0.55 to 339.39, the New York Stock
Composite Index rose 0.47 to 186.10 and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index added 0.51 to 314.55.
   Advancing issues topped decliners on the Big Board by 852
to 640. Volume amounted to 130,320,000 shares, up from
122,820,000 Monday but well below the totals set earlier this
month when prices plummeted. "There's just a lot of waiting
and seeing going on here," said Robert S. Robbins, a market
strategist and technical analyst at Robinson-Humphrey Co.,
Atlanta.
   Stocks drifted back to their session lows at midmorning,
but then started to recover amid news that King Hussein of
Jordan was on his way to meet with President Bush a day after
holding talks with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Flurries of program buying resulting from stock-index
arbitrage fueled the market's rise, traders said. The
programs were triggered when index futures rallied to sharp
premiums to the cash indexes, allowing program traders to
lock in profits by selling index-futures contracts and buying
baskets of stocks.
   Prices peaked in the final hour of trading as the
arbitrage buying ran its course, and the market came under
selling pressure near the close. The industrial average
erased gains of about 15 points and stood slightly lower just
before the session ended.
   Mr. Robbins said the market is going through what he
called "a smoke clearing" following Iraq's occupation of
Kuwait. "We've got more inflation, and we've got the threat
of a mild recession," he said.
   But he noted that prices rebounded after falling about 10%
from their highs -- in line with most of the market's
pullbacks in the past few years. "We could get a bounce all
the way up to 2850 on the Dow {industrials}," he said.
   The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 11.13 to 967.70
as airline issues were hit with selling, especially AMR,
which lost 2 1/8 to 49 on about double its average Big Board
composite daily volume.
   First Boston analyst Paul Karos told Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report he will lower his 1990 and 1991
earnings estimates sharply on AMR, citing
weaker-than-expected business at its American Airlines unit.
Mr. Karos declined to specify his new estimates.
   AMR acknowledged that it has been reducing its
expectations for air traffic growth, based on advance booking
levels. "We don't know how much" the growth will drop off,
said AMR spokesman Tim Smith. Shortly after the close, the
company said it would cut certain fares by 15% to 40%; Trans
World Airlines and Eastern Airlines lowered their fares
Monday.
   UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, fell 4 3/8 to
105 3/4 after postponing a planned 5.3% fare increase,
designed to offset higher fuel costs. Delta Air Lines dropped
1 7/8 to 57 1/2.
   Advanced Micro Devices rose 1/4 to 6 on 1.5 million
shares, reflecting speculation that the company may obtain
the right to manufacture its own version of Intel's 80386
microprocessor. The companies' dispute over the issue is now
in arbitration, and a decision is due next month.
   Bear Stearns &amp; Co. analyst Monroe I. Neff cited the
potential for Advanced Micro to win the case for cutting
Intel's investment rating to "hold" from "buy," according to
the investor report. Intel, which also was removed from the
firm's list of recommended issues, fell 1 1/4 to 37 and was
the most active issue traded on the Nasdaq National Market
System.
   General Motors added 5/8 to 40 1/8 after reaching a
tentative settlement with the United Auto Workers union of a
strike at a parts plant in Michigan. The walkout had forced a
full or partial shutdown of five GM assembly plants.
   May Department Stores rose 1 5/8 to 46 5/8. Other
retailing issues also moved higher as the market digested
quarterly reports; Tiffany rose 1 1/8 to 39 1/8, TJX climbed
1 1/8 to 15 and Waban gained 3/4 to 7 3/4.
   On the other hand, J.C. Penney fell 2 to 48 1/2 following
its fiscal second-quarter earnings report, which showed that
net income declined 15% from the year-earlier level. Analysts
had generally forecast that earnings would be about even with
a year ago.
   Sotheby's Holdings, whose second-quarter earnings were in
line with expectations, added 3/4 to 13 1/4. Net income
climbed 26% from a year earlier.
   Hanson rose 3/4 to 20 3/8. The British company posted a
27% increase in pretax profit for the nine months ended in
June.
   Avnet added 1 to 24 1/2 after its board authorized the
repurchase of up to one million common shares, representing
about 2.8% of its shares outstanding.
   Marion Merrell Dow went up 1 7/8 to 31 1/2. The company
increased its quarterly dividend by one-third, to 20 cents a
share.
   Cineplex Odeon, which said there is "substantial
uncertainty" about whether a proposed sale of 38 movie
theaters for $31.75 million will be completed, fell 1/2 to 3
1/8. Also, the company reported a second-quarter loss that
was only slightly narrower than its loss from continuing
operations a year earlier.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.94
to 339.94. Volume totaled 15,770,000 shares.

   IN THE PERSIAN GULF -- Aboard the U.S.S. LaSalle, the
squeal of the chemical attack siren cuts the steamy morning
air. "End of test," says a calm voice over the ship's public
address system. "Regard all further alarms."
   The U.S. Navy is back, in force, in the gulf, on a mission
with new risks and new rules that aren't yet fully defined.
When the U.S. fleet sailed in here in 1987 in efforts to stop
Iranian attacks on shipping, it was Iraq that benefited as
U.S. ships permitted the safe passage of Iraqi oil.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, Iraq is the enemy. Helicopter pilots, ferrying
supplies to the U.S. armada, wear newly printed "Saddam
Busters" T-shirts under their flight suits.
   The Aegis-class cruiser Antietam scrambled to program its
cruise missiles with new targets. Until five days ago, the
ship's vast store of preprogrammed enemy objectives didn't
include any targets in Kuwait and Iraq, according to one
crewman.
   Aboard the fleet's flagship, LaSalle -- painted white to
reflect the heat -- Adm. William Fogarty commands 24 ships,
200 aircraft and 17,000 troops who don't yet know exactly
what they will be called upon to do.
   Some are finding out exactly where they are. Senior
officers talk about setting up operations in "Ridyar,"
stumbling over the name of the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh.
Crewmen are even more confused. "To tell you the truth, I
didn't know where Kuwait was," says a young engineman aboard
the Antietam, which was cruising in the southern Indian Ocean
when orders came through to rush to the gulf.
   Others are baffled by Islamic fundamentalists' complaints
that American "infidels" are defiling the soil of Saudi
Arabia, which contains the holy city of Mecca. "The {Saudi}
government asked for our assistance," says Antietam's
captain, Lawrence Eddingfield. "And I don't feel like an
infidel."
   Capt. Eddingfield begins lunch in the officer's mess with
a prayer that "God be with the world leaders" and help them
keep the peace.
   "We are not here to start anything. We are not
war-mongering," he says. To help his men understand their
mission, he has installed an Associated Press newswire aboard
ship. Copies of a Time magazine cover story on Saddam Hussein
were photocopied and passed around.
   So far, the ships are playing a sweaty game of watching
and waiting, hoping their missiles and big guns will help
deter any Iraqi strike on Saudi Arabia. But the Navy's main
role is likely to become enforcing the United Nations embargo
on Iraq's trade, blocking goods going in and oil going out of
the ports of Iraq and Kuwait.
   Adm. Fogarty says Washington still is working on details
of how such intercepts might work, if and when Iraq
challenges the embargo.
   But one thing everybody knows is that Saddam Hussein has
threatened to use chemical weapons. The unthinkable has
become routine for the Antietam's young crew, whose average
age is 22. A lieutenant cheerfully demonstrates what he calls
"the latest and greatest the Navy has come up with" -- a
green hooded smock and pants, filled with chemical-absorbing
charcoal, thick rubber gloves and boots, and a lightweight
face mask. Crew members are taught to recognize the symptoms
of exposure to various chemical agents. Nerve gas, explains
the still-cheerful lieutenant, "makes your mouth water like
you haven't eaten for two days and you just sat down in front
of a steak dinner." In such a case, crewmen are supposed to
jab their thighs with prepared injections of a blocking agent
called atropine.
   There isn't any easily administered antidote for blood
agents such as cyanide, which can kill in seconds, nor for
blistering agents such as mustard gas. But ships' crews are
vastly better off than land forces, since the ship can go
"circle William" -- code for sealing off the interior air
supply. Heat stress in the protective suits also isn't as
dangerous at sea, as the crew can take turns outside in the
heat and inside where there is air conditioning.
   But even without the special horrors of chemical war,
conventional threats abound. On the fore deck, two crewmen
peer into the azure waters of the gulf, scanning for mines
left behind from the Iran-Iraq war.
   Saddam Hussein has Exocet missiles, the weapons that
killed U.S. sailors aboard the U.S.S. Stark in 1987. An Iraqi
pilot apparently misidentified the Stark as an Iranian craft.
Unready for an attack, the Stark had its Phalanx system -- a
gatling gun firing high-density anti-missile pellets --
switched off.
   The Stark "was a tragedy, but we did learn a lot of
lessons from it," says Adm. Fogarty. "We had exercises and
drills every day on that thing."
   Another tragedy with less easily learned lessons was the
1988 shooting down by the U.S.S. Vincennes of an Iran Air
passenger jet that it had mistaken for a hostile aircraft.
The Antietam, like the Vincennes, is an Aegis-class cruiser
with a similar computerized command center. Because the
Iranian Airbus accident was attributed to human error,
procedures in the command center haven't been significantly
revised.
   Below deck, huge blue screens try to make electronic sense
of the shipping clutter and crowded airways of the gulf. In
cool darkness, the hot bright waters, their fishermen and
traders, are reduced to obstructions: squares for unknown
surface vessels, circles for "surface friendlies," cup shapes
for submarines. Anything that can't be identified by radar
requires reconnaissance by helicopters.
   For the ordinary people of the gulf, all this high-tech
weaponry makes life difficult and dangerous. Youssef Bin
Dahraj's fishing boat was off the Saudi coast four nights ago
when a U.S. helicopter came swooping down to take a look. His
crew of Madrasi sailors, terrified by the encounter, now
refuse to go more than a few miles from their home port in
Bahrain.
   "It means less fish, less money," he says.
   Dozens of fishermen and small traders were caught in the
crossfire of the Iran-Iraq war. In 1987, Americans shot an
Indian fisherman in the gulf, mistaking him for an Iranian
terrorist. Mr. Bin Dahraj lost a friend, whose boat hit a
mine. The small, high-prowed wooden dhows that ply the gulf
"shatter like matches," the fisherman says, shaking his head
sadly. "Now, it seems we are once again too close to war, and
everyone is afraid here."

   Well, table settings. "Is it right to put Lenox china on
the same table with traditional Japanese lacquerware?"
wonders Akio Tanaka, division director at MITI, the
no-nonsense bureaucracy better known for pondering how to
build faster computers and export more automobiles. "What
settings are best for French foods?"
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a recently released report, "Vision for the 1990s,"
MITI promised to give this hard-driving country a better
quality of life. Now the ministry is making good on that
pledge with a bold new initiative focusing on the nation's
table manners.
   MITI officials have commissioned a committee of business
and government executives to develop and promote "new ways of
dining and communicating." The committee's formal mandate is
to exchange ideas about expanding Japan's leisure and service
industries. But Mr. Tanaka, who is responsible for the
project, says the group is also a forum for discussing ways
to help Japanese consumers shed their image as nouveau riche
and become more cosmopolitan and genteel.
   MITI officials are asking companies in the food and
beverage, tableware, hotel and other industries to help the
ministry raise Japan's cultural and culinary sensitivities.
"We want to make sure that the Japanese know how to use good
products, not just make them," Mr. Tanaka says.
   The group also wants to promote the proper mix of party
guests and is looking for ways to get more women and
foreigners invited to social gatherings in Japan, Mr. Tanaka
says.
   If the project's kick-off party is any indication, the
ministry has a way to go. Gesturing apologetically around the
banquet hall at dripping ice sculptures and clusters of
blue-suited, beer-drinking Japanese businessmen, Mr. Tanaka
concedes: "Of course, this reception is rather conventional."
   The committee's first item of business when it convenes
next month will be to draft a questionnaire for housewives so
as to learn more about Japanese dining habits. Mr. Tanaka
hopes that data will help MITI and the panel to gain greater
insight into how Japanese households communicate. "Eating and
talking are activities that have always gone together," he
says.
   Let's see, isn't that known as talking with your mouth
full?

   Edgell Offers Plan
   To Its Bondholders
   For Debt Payments

   NEW YORK -- Edgell Communications Inc., the former unit of
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. taken private in a management
buy-out in 1987, has offered its bondholders and creditors a
plan to restructure debt payments.
   The exchange offer from New Century Communications Inc.,
the New York-based parent holding company of Edgell
Communications, follows a deteriorating situation at the
publishing and trade show company. Founder Robert Edgell
unexpectedly resigned in March as chief executive. And the
company did not make a $7 million interest payment to
bondholders on July 16.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cleveland-based Edgell, one of the country's largest trade
magazine publishers and a growing force in the trade
exposition field, continues to operate with substantial
profit margins, Edgell executives said. But revenue from
magazines and trade shows have not grown as expected, and the
company can't keep up with interest payments.
   Richard B. Swank, the recently appointed chief executive
officer of Edgell, said that as part of the restructuring
plan, as many as eight Edgell magazines have been pegged for
sale.
   Edgell Communications was formed in 1987, when Mr. Edgell
led management in a $334.1 million leveraged buy-out of the
business publications and school supplies unit of Harcourt
Brace. The buy-out was financed by Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., a
unit of General Electric Co., and General Electric Capital
Corp., another GE unit, which remains the majority owner of
Edgell. Traditionally profitable but unglamorous, Edgell's
trade magazines include Urology Times, Pipeline &amp; Gas
Journal, and Food Management, as well as 52 other titles.
   In the exchange offer made last week, Edgell is proposing
a change in the amortization schedule on a $185 million loan
from General Electric Credit Corp. Edgell is asking that
interest payments on the loan be delayed and spread out over
a period of time. Edgell is also proposing that institutions
that own about $100 million in high-yield junk bonds exchange
their bonds for equity in the company. Edgell's buy-out was
also backed by $5 million from private investors, as well as
about $8 million in cash and $45 million in preferred shares
from Kidder, Peabody.
   The deadline for the exchange offer is Aug. 30. Neither
Kidder nor General Electric would comment on the exchange
offers.
   Edgell is still a "good company," Mr. Swank said, which he
claimed has operating profit margins of more than 20% in
magazines and more than 35% in the trade show business.

   New Treatment
   For AIDS Seen
   As Promising

   Medical researchers said a new approach to treating an
intermediate form of acquired immune deficiency syndrome
showed promise in a preliminary clinical trial involving five
patients.
   The significance of the findings was unclear because so
few patients were studied and because of other limitations in
the trial, including lack of a control group. Indeed, editors
of Annals of Internal Medicine, where the study appears in
the current issue, cautioned that it leaves "substantial
questions" unanswered. But they decided to publish the
results anyway because "AIDS is a calamitous illness" and
"positive results were reported for a treatment unique for an
infectious disease." The Food and Drug Administration has
approved the approach for further study.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The treatment is called photopheresis. In the process, a
sample of a patient's blood is separated into red and white
blood cells after the patient takes a light-sensitive drug
called 8-methoxypsoralen. Then the white blood cells are
exposed to ultraviolet-A radiation and returned to the body.
   The five patients -- three homosexual men and two
intravenous drug users, one female -- were treated twice
monthly for up to 15 months. All were diagnosed as having
AIDS-related complex, or ARC, a condition preliminary to
full-blown AIDS and characterized by fatigue, swollen lymph
nodes and diminished counts of infection-fighting T-cells.
None of the patients had previous therapy for AIDS.
   Four of the patients were significantly improved after six
months both in subjective reports of physical well-being and
in certain objective blood chemistry indicators. One of the
improved patients voluntarily halted treatment after five
months, but continued to be evaluated during the course of
the study. Encouraging results continued in the other three
for up to 15 months. One patient, the woman with a history of
drug abuse, didn't respond to the treatment.
   The researchers aren't sure how the treatment works, but
believe that it inactivates the AIDS virus, thus preventing
its ability to infect other cells. A similar procedure has
proved beneficial in treating T-cell lymphoma, a cancer of
the lymphatic system.
   "The results are encouraging but must be viewed with
extreme caution," says Emil Bisaccia, medical director of the
photopheresis unit at Morristown Memorial Hospital in
Morristown, N.J., where the research was done, and an
assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University
College of Physicians and Surgeons.

   NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. suspended publication of
Fortune France, a French-language version of its U.S. edition
published in partnership with Hachette Filipacchi Group.
   Time Inc. Magazines, the publishing unit of Time Warner,
said it backed out of the two-year-old venture after clashing
with its partner about the editorial direction of the
magazine. Time and Hachette shared revenue from the business
magazine, and Marshall Loeb, managing editor of the U.S.
edition of Fortune, had final approval of stories used in the
French edition.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The closure of Fortune France is a setback to Time
Warner's plans to extend its major U.S. magazines in Europe
and Asia. Because of the disagreement over editorial policy
for Fortune France, Time executives said they won't go
through with plans to produce a Spanish edition of Fortune
with Hachette. In Italy, Time Warner currently publishes
Fortune Italia in partnership with Arnoldo Mondadori Editore
S.p.A.
   In a related development at home, Time Warner said it will
publish a test issue of a woman's magazine developed with
home entertainment entrepreneur Martha Stewart. The magazine,
called Martha Stewart Living, is being developed by Time
Publishing Ventures, a newly formed unit. The magazine's
first issue will appear in November, with a second issue
planned for early spring 1991.
   Despite a poor advertising market for magazines, Time
Warner has several other titles in the works, including
Fortune for Students, with distribution through Junior
Achievement, a nonprofit organization. There's also a sports
history magazine, with the working title Sports Illustrated
Classic, that will be published three times in 1991.
   With the largest U.S. and French magazine publishers
behind it, Fortune France was an early hit, selling out on
newsstands, and proving to be a model of expansion for Time
Inc. magazines in Europe. Time Warner and Hachette would have
shared profits, but the two-year-old magazine wasn't expected
to make money until after 1991.
   In the last year, advertising for Fortune France dropped
off. On newsstands, the magazine, with circulation of 50,000,
faced competition from a growing number of French and
European business magazines.
   In order to spur a new wave of interest in Fortune France,
according to Time executives, Hachette editors were calling
for more life style coverage in the business magazine.
Marshall Loeb, managing editor of Fortune, objected to
Hachette's plans. Hachette executives could not be reached
for comment.
   James B. Hayes, publisher of U.S. Fortune, said Time
didn't want to compromise Fortune's reputation. "Our
franchise is management issues and issues of importance to
corporate executives," he said.

   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade said it will next
month begin trading its first futures contracts based on
Japanese stock and bond markets.
   The exchange said it will launch long-term Japanese
Government Bond futures and futures-options trading Sept. 27,
along with its so-called TOPIX futures and options, which
will be based on the Tokyo Stock Price Index.

<TEXT>
   The CBOT and the Tokyo Stock Exchange agreed in 1988 to
cooperate in launching TOPIX and Japanese Government Bond
futures at the CBOT, and U.S. Treasury bond futures at the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   Uncertainty caused by the 1987 stock-market crash slowed
development of the plan. The recent sharp decline in prices
at the Tokyo Stock Exchange increased interest in financial
instruments that would allow investors to hedge holdings in
Japanese stocks, similar to the measures currently afforded
by futures contracts based on such U.S. market indicators as
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.

   Economy:
   Retail Sales
   Grew in July
   By a Scant 0.1%

   Increase in Gasoline Prices
   May Force Consumers
   To Further Curb Buying

   WASHINGTON -- Even before vaulting oil prices rattled
consumers, retail sales were barely growing, government
statistics show.
   The Commerce Department reported that retail sales inched
up 0.1% in July after rising 1.1% in June and falling the
three previous months. Car, clothing, restaurant and filling
station sales all declined last month; sales grew at
furniture, hardware, drug and general-merchandise stores.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The big question now is whether the jump in gasoline and
other energy costs provoked by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
will lead consumers to curb spending in other areas. If they
do, one of the most powerful engines driving the 7 1/2-year
economic expansion, already sputtering, will have stalled.
   "I'm relatively pessimistic," said Aubrey Zaffuto, an
economist at IBJ Schroeder Bank &amp; Trust Co. in New York. The
latest sales report, she said, "is consistent with a consumer
probably overburdened with debt, hoping interest rates were
going to go down" but haven't, and who "now will be pinched
further by rising oil prices."
   Retail sales amount to about half of U.S. consumer
spending, which in turn accounts for two thirds of the
nation's economic activity.
   "The recent rise in oil prices threatens to keep retail
sales growth down in coming months," said Richard Rahn, chief
economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "Consumers will
spend more on petroleum products, leaving them with less
money to spend on other products."
   Moreover, the figures aren't adjusted for inflation, and
so far this year retail sales haven't kept pace with rising
prices. "When adjusted for inflation," Mr. Rahn forecast,
"consumer spending will continue to fall for the rest of
1990."
   In the bond market, however, many traders focused on the
May and June sales numbers, which the department revised
upward from preliminary figures. The traders took the
alterations as an indication that the economy hasn't been as
weak as many analysts believed. The 1.1% increase in June
sales was significantly higher than the Commerce Department's
earlier calculation of a 0.5% rise. And after reviewing new
data, the department said retail sales slipped only 0.1% in
May instead of the 0.6% it estimated earlier.
   The retail sales figures are based on a relatively small
sample of reports and frequently are revised as more
information comes in. The numbers exclude spending on
services, which accounts for a large portion of consumer
outlays.
   Frederick Sturm, senior economist at Fuji Securities in
Chicago, said the revisions and the slim July sales gain
"don't change our mind about the behavior of the
macroeconomy. Essentially, the economy is stumbling along. We
don't think that it's actually going to collapse into
recession."
   Whether or not the economy steers clear of a downturn
depends on the Federal Reserve, many economists believe. The
central bank is caught in a particularly delicate situation.
Bush administration officials believe Fed policy makers
should push down interest rates in order to stimulate the
flagging economy and save it from recession. But Fed
officials are wary of easing their grip on credit in the face
of mounting inflation prompted by the oil price rise.
   Overall retail sales totaled $149.51 billion in July, the
Commerce Department said. Car sales fell 0.6%. Sales of
home-related products were surprisingly strong, baffling many
economists who expected continued weakness because of the
troubled real estate markets in many regions of the country.
Furniture sales rose 2.5%, while sales of building materials
and hardware jumped 3.9%. Most economists said they expected
those figures to be revised downward after more data come in.
   All the figures are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.

   Columbia S&amp;L Had
   Loss of $136.5 Million
   In Second Quarter

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association, sinking deeper into insolvency and possibly into
the arms of federal regulators, reported a second-quarter net
loss of $136.5 million, or $6.78 a share.
   Columbia cited four factors: an $88.5 million provision
for credit losses on investment securities and loans; a $65
million loss from real-estate investment operations due
largely to the declining Southern California commercial
real-estate market; a $29.2 million loss recorded with
respect to certain corporate facilities, and a $20.9 million
write-down in its mortgage-backed securities holdings.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The loss reduced stockholders' equity to a deficit of
$352.2 million at June 30. In a statement, Edward G.
Harshfield, president and chief executive officer, said the
company "will need the continuing patience and cooperation of
our regulators if Columbia is to survive." Despite being
insolvent, Columbia hasn't been taken over by regulators.
   Mr. Harshfield said the latest charges reflect efforts to
"stabilize Columbia, to identify realizable values for the
assets Columbia holds and to position the association for the
sale of its high-yield bond portfolio."
   The thrift agreed last month to sell the portfolio of junk
bonds to a Canadian and Hong Kong investor group for $3
billion; regulators must still approve the transaction.
Declining values of the bonds over the last few months have
been mainly responsible for Columbia's insolvency, although
Mr. Harshfield said the losses basically ended in the latest
quarter.
   The loss for the quarter ended June 30 compared with net
income of $6.4 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier.
For the six months, Columbia reported a net loss of $429.9
million, or $21.39 a share, compared to profit of $14.3
million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.

   Lost Gold

   A federal judge ruled that a group of treasure hunters can
keep the largest trove in American history -- gold found in a
ship that sank 133 years ago off South Carolina.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Kellam in Norfolk, Va., ruled
yesterday that Columbus-America Discovery Group, a private
marine-exploration company based in Columbus, Ohio, is the
owner of a cache of thousands of mint-condition gold coins
and rare gold bars valued at between $450 million and $1
billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Judge Kellam rejected the arguments of eight insurance
companies and the state of New York's acting superintendent
of insurance that they owned the gold because they had paid
out claims arising from the 1857 disaster.
   Before the ruling, only nations had been found to have
deep-ocean salvage rights in international waters. Lawyers
said that the court's decision to grant individuals the same
rights could affect future exploration of the deep sea and,
ultimately, outer space.
   In addition, Judge Kellam's decision is significant
because he allowed the group to establish ownership of the
treasure using remote video cameras to produce live images
and robots to retrieve objects. Previously, courts had ruled
that ocean explorers had to physically dive to a site to
stake a claim.
   "The decision is a major development in the law. This
makes it clear that individuals are free to explore the deep
ocean and enjoy the benefits of their discoveries," says
Richard Robol of the Norfolk law firm Hunton &amp; Williams,
which represented Columbus-America.
   Douglas A. Jacobsen, a partner with the New York law firm
Bigham Englar Jones &amp; Houston, which represented the
insurers, said that if the decision is upheld, "it means that
the game is one of finders keepers. We are opposed to that
idea. Owners' rights still exist. Just because something has
been gone for a long time doesn't mean the ownership title is
lost."
   The judge also dismissed claims filed by rival treasure
hunters Harry John and Jack Grimm, as well as the trustees of
Columbia University, who alleged that the Columbus-America
group misappropriated their research about the ship's
location.
   The bitter legal battle was spawned by the discovery of
gold in 1989 in the wreck of the S.S. Central America, a
luxury steamship that sank in 8,000 feet of water, 160 miles
off the coast of South Carolina.
   Bearing three tons of California gold and 476 passengers,
many of them prospectors returning from months in the gold
mines, the S.S. Central America steamed into a hurricane on
its way to New York. Passengers and crew spent 30 desperate
hours bailing water. Women and children escaped to a passing
vessel; the men stayed on.
   Only 166 passengers survived. Many were dragged to the
bottom of the Atlantic, weighed down by heavy gold money
belts they refused to remove from around their waists.
   At the time of the sinking, many banks teetered on the
verge of collapse. Officials had stemmed the rising financial
panic with announcements that the Central America's gold
shipment was due soon. The sinking touched off a wave of bank
failures and unleashed the "Panic of 1857," a major economic
downturn.
   Searches for the ship turned up nothing, and over the
years the gold became one of the most sought-after treasures.
The Columbus-America group's quest began in 1981 and has
already cost more than $10 million. The money was put up by
166 investors, most of them from the Columbus area.
   The search was masterminded by Thomas G. Thompson, a
research scientist with Columbus think tank Batelle Memorial
Institute, who believed that newly available technology used
by the Pentagon to find lost submarines could be applied to
treasure hunting, making deep-sea recovery economically
feasible for the first time.
   Using a remote-controlled, 5,000-pound robot sprouting an
arm and video cameras, Mr. Thompson's group searched a
1,400-square-mile area. The group was hampered by bad
weather, mechanical failures and the fact that it initially
focused on the wrong site.
   But in 1989, Mr. Thompson arrived at the Norfolk port
bearing a ton and a half of booty. That find set off a kind
of gold rush, as other parties sought a share of the
treasure.
   In his decision, Judge Kellam did not dispute the fact
that insurance companies may have paid out claims. But he
said the eight companies had intentionally abandoned their
rights to any recovery when they destroyed records relating
to the sinking of the ship. The insurers comprise two U.S.
concerns, Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. of Murray Hill, N.J.,
and Insurance Co. of North America, a unit of Cigna Corp. of
Philadelphia; and six British companies.
   Judge Kellam said the companies had kept no copies of
insurance policies, invoices for shipments, or other records
in order to establish a claim for the gold. He said there was
no indication that the companies had attempted to recover the
ship and that newspaper accounts of the amount of money paid
by insurance companies contained too many discrepancies to be
considered reliable proof.
   "They had no hope or idea they could locate the Central
America, and even if they located it, they had no hope they
could recover anything from it," Judge Kellam wrote.
   Mr. Jacobsen, who represented the insurers, said that no
one would intentionally give up their rights to a cargo of
gold and that he will recommend that his clients appeal.
   Judge Kellam's ruling also dismissed the claims of
treasure hunters Messrs. John and Grimm and Columbia
University. The judge ruled there was no evidence that Mr.
Thompson used their results from a 1984 survey of the ocean
floor done during a search for the Central America and that
they were therefore not entitled to any share of the
recovery. A lawyer for Messrs. John and Grimm said he will
recommend an appeal. A lawyer for Columbia said the
university hadn't decided yet whether to appeal.
   Mr. Thompson said it will take at least another year
before all the gold is brought up from the bottom of the
ocean. In the meantime, it seems unlikely that the judge's
decision will put an end to all the confusion. Mr. Thompson
has been sued by California treasure hunter Dennis A.
Standefer, who alleged he provided research that led to the
gold's recovery and is seeking a share of Mr. Thompson's
reward. The case was recently dismissed, but Mr. Standefer is
appealing. Mr. Thompson's wife is also claiming a share of
the gold in their pending divorce proceedings.

   STATE JUDGES focus on resolving asbestos litigation.
   Although recent actions by federal judges have put
asbestos personal-injury litigation in the news, most of the
cases are before state courts. Working in conjunction with
some of the federal judges, three state judges from New York,
Baltimore and Philadelphia have begun planning a conference
for this fall at which about a dozen judges from across the
country will meet.
   "Nothing is more important to the state judiciary than the
resolution of this asbestos problem," said Judge Marshall A.
Levin, a Maryland state circuit court judge in Baltimore. The
huge backlog of asbestos personal-injury cases has the
potential "to wreck the court system," he added.
   Many judges have become frustrated with the growing
backlog of asbestos cases and fear that some defendants may
run out of funds before all the claims are paid. Asbestos,
once used in shipbuilding and construction, causes cancer and
respiratory ailments.
   Of the estimated 100,000 asbestos personal-injury cases
now pending in U.S. courts, about two-thirds are before state
judges. Although some state judges may be reluctant to give
up their control of such cases, Judge Levin said he believes
most welcome the possibility of a national settlement that
would include the state cases. The federal judges pursuing a
national resolution of the cases have indicated that they
expect state judges to come on board.
   "It will lighten our burden considerably," clearing the
way for state courts to handle more criminal cases as well as
other civil litigation, said Judge Levin. Judge Levin has
5,300 asbestos cases pending.
   The other two state judges working closely with Judge
Levin are Justice Helen Freedman of Manhattan and Judge
Sandra Mazer Moss of Philadelphia.
   Justice Freedman said she expects the state judges to
focus on alternative ways to encourage the parties to settle
the suits and avoid going to trial. She said a
claims-resolution system needs to be set up to ensure that
the more seriously ill claimants are paid first and to speed
up the compensation process.
   Separately, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals
yesterday upheld a freeze on payments by the Manville
asbestos personal-injury trust. The decision strengthens the
authority of U.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who has asserted
control over the trust.
   Some asbestos victims' attorneys had requested that the
freeze on settlement and judgment payments be lifted, arguing
that Judge Weinstein had overstepped his jurisdiction.
   The trust, formed in the bankruptcy-court reorganization
of Manville Corp., told the appeals court it supported the
freeze while it works out a way to solve its huge cash
shortage.
   The freeze ends Sept. 6, the deadline Judge Weinstein set
for the trust to come up with new financing.

   SETTLEMENT FUND to be used for public interest law
fellowships.
   U.S. District Judge Ann Claire Williams of Chicago ruled
that a $6 million surplus from the settlement of the
folding-carton industry antitrust litigation should be used
to pay graduating law students and judicial clerks to provide
legal services to the poor.
   Alexander Domanskis, a partner with the Chicago law firm
Ross &amp; Hardies, says this may be the first time a settlement
fund will be used to finance a nationwide public interest
program. Mr. Domanskis is a member of a four-lawyer
administration committee appointed by the judge to draft an
outline for the fellowship program.
   The federal court's order is the latest in protracted
legal maneuvering over the surplus from an 11-year-old $200
million settlement. The folding-carton case was a
price-fixing civil suit filed in 1976 by some 2,700 companies
against 24 paper and carton manufacturers.
   The judge's order is subject to review by a federal
appeals court in Chicago, which last year rejected a
court-ordered proposal for the surplus to go to two
Chicago-area law schools to study antitrust litigation.
   The appeals court knocked down the proposal because it
said the plan wasn't necessary or national in scope.

   EFFORT TO FORCE Dennis Levine to testify in inside-trading
case is rejected.
   A federal magistrate in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Levine
didn't waive his constitutional right not to incriminate
himself when he wrote a Fortune magazine article in May about
his insider trading.
   Litton Industries Inc. is seeking to force Mr. Levine to
testify in its civil suit against him and against Lehman
Bros. Kuhn Loeb Inc., Litton's former investment adviser and
Mr. Levine's former employer. The suit, filed in 1986, claims
that Litton ended up paying too much for its takeover of Itek
Corp. because Mr. Levine leaked news of the transaction to
traders. Lehman Bros. is now part of American Express Co.'s
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. unit.
   Litton argued that Mr. Levine should be ordered to testify
because the details in his article indicate that Mr. Levine
has no reasonable fear of further prosecution. Mr. Levine
claimed the information in the article was previously
disclosed in documents and proceedings related to his guilty
plea in 1986.
   U.S. Magistrate Nina Gershon, however, found that Mr.
Levine's statements in the article don't waive his
constitutional rights.
   She also ruled that while further prosecution of Mr.
Levine appears unlikely, it remains a possibility.

   NEW YORK -- Yields on small-denomination certificates of
deposit sold directly by major banks continued to ease in the
latest week, although large deposits and certificates of
deposit sold by brokerage firms posted higher yields.
   The average yield on a small-denomination six-month
certificate of deposit, for instance, slipped to 7.38% from
7.42% in the week ended Tuesday, according to Banxquote Money
Markets, an information service based here. On a one-year
certificate of deposit, the average yield dipped to 7.52%
from 7.57% for small denominations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On deposits of $90,000 and up, however, the average yield
rose slightly to 7.53% from 7.51% for six months and to 7.63%
from 7.60% for one year, Banxquote reported. Broker-sold
certificates of deposit posted bigger increases in yields.
The largest jump was on one-year deposits, with the average
yield rising to 7.89% from 7.72% in one week.
   Brokerage firms, which negotiate rates with banks and
thrifts whose certificates of deposit they sell, offer higher
average yields across the board. On five-year certificates of
deposit, the average yield at broker-dealers was 8.38%,
compared with 7.87% on smaller deposits at major banks and
8.14% on $90,000 and up.

   A Son's Effort to Fix Dad's Place in History

   Few sons could be more devoted to their father's memory
than Sergei Khrushchev. His "Khrushchev on Khrushchev"
(Little, Brown, 423 pages, $24.95) is an interesting account
of his father's fall from power in October 1964, his
retirement under virtual house arrest, and the surreptitious
preparation of his memoirs, which were smuggled out and later
published in the West in the 1970s. Above all, the book is
the son's effort to fix Khrushchev's place in history --
after almost 25 years as a nonperson -- as a sort of
proto-Gorbachev.
   How does this claim stand up? Khrushchev's reputation
rests chiefly on his secret speech to the 20th Party Congress
in 1956. In it, he denounced Stalin three years after his
death for his crimes against the party (while omitting most
of his far greater crimes against the Russian people). Still,
Khrushchev and his colleagues ended the terror, closed most
of the camps (freeing millions), tolerated a cultural thaw,
and introduced a measure of "socialist legality" into Soviet
life.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Though a confirmed ideologue, Khrushchev had enough
flexibility to attempt to reduce the bureaucracy's choke-hold
on the economy. He tried to decentralize government economic
decision-making, and later divided the provincial party
apparatus into industrial and agricultural units. He also was
something of a populist and tried to limit terms of higher
party officials. These moves failed, however, and provoked
the apparat, led by his protegee Leonid Brezhnev, to oust him
at age 70.
   But Sergei's dad also had been Stalin's viceroy of the
Ukraine in the later 1930s and a vocal proponent of the show
trials; he helped to Bolshevize the section of Poland annexed
in 1939, through arrests and deportations; he sent the tanks
into Budapest in 1956 and later ordered the execution of the
Hungarian leader, Imre Nagy; he built the Berlin Wall,
approved the vicious campaign against Boris Pasternak,
exploded the biggest nuclear weapons in the atmosphere to
intimidate the U.S., and brought us all to the brink by
sending missiles to Cuba.
   But if Sergei, an engineer with a nice writing style,
ignores his father's sizable warts, his descriptions of the
era are valuable. Sergei writes that he got wind of the plot
against his father in the fall of 1964, but that Khrushchev
didn't take it too seriously until he was summoned back from
his Crimean dacha to confront a united party leadership.
   Customarily, party officials would greet him at the
airport, but this time, Sergei recounts, "the tarmac in front
of the plane was empty except for two small figures looming
up in the distance. You couldn't make out who they were from
the plane. Not a good sign." One was the KGB chairman.
Feeling his age, Khrushchev acquiesced. "The fear's gone and
we can talk as equals," he said, alluding to the old terror.
"That's my contribution. I won't put up a fight." After a
deep depression, he lived out his years in a Moscow apartment
and a modest dacha where he practiced hydroponics.
   Urged by his family to write his memoirs, Khrushchev began
dictating in 1966. The tapes were transcribed secretly by
Sergei and others; ordered to cease writing by the Central
Committee, Khrushchev refused and had the tapes smuggled to
the West. Later, when the KGB forced Sergei to turn over his
copies, the son, using methods he still does not feel free to
reveal, gave a prearranged signal for publication. The former
ruler and his family were forced into dissidence and became
the oppressed, rather than the oppressor.
   The family got an even stronger dose of the system when
Khrushchev died in 1971. Their mourning had to wait while
party officials, looking for more memoirs, arrived at the
house to confiscate many of his papers. The mighty Politburo
feared this dead man, so the funeral was held under KGB
supervision; from the wake at the hospital, the coffin was
whisked off at high speed to a closely guarded cemetery
where, nonetheless, a crowd had gathered and a few speeches
were made.
   Not one member of the leadership called to offer
condolences. "Death equals everyone," Sergei writes bitterly.
"Unfortunately, a certain degree of culture is required to
understand this."
   Several years passed before Sergei could obtain official
approval for a modest graveside monument. The committee
required to approve the design was not under orders to
disapprove, but took the typical course of avoiding giving
possible offense to the authorities by doing nothing.
Eventually, at Mrs. Khrushchev's request, Premier Kosygin
intervened, and Sergei got his monument. Khrushchev's name
was again heard in party councils in a speech by Gorbachev in
1987.
   Sergei doesn't say whether Khrushchev's harassment led him
to question the system itself. Although Sergei himself was
clearly disgusted by his experiences, his comment at the
book's end, that perestroika began with the revolution in
1917, indicates he is either still a loyal communist or a man
with his head in the clouds. Perestroika can succeed only
with the recognition that 1917 marked not the beginning of
perestroika but the start of Russia's nightmare.

   How many weeks or months of a normal life-time does the
average American spend opening and discarding junk mail or
answering junk phone calls? With each of these usually
unwelcome messages, we feel the impact of a big business: the
collecting, collating and selling of personal information.
The data derive from transactions with mail order houses,
credit card firms, charities or other organizations --
dealings one might have considered private at the time. Yet
sale of the personal data surrendered there supports
activities that erode our privacy. Though we are the unique
sources of such information, we have little control over its
use, and no share in the profits from that use.
   An enlightened measure could redress these inequities. We
should establish for every individual a form of property
right over commercial use of his or her own data. Everyone
could withhold, sell or give away rights to commercial sale
or exchange of information about himself or herself. Some
privacy-loving citizens would no doubt exercise the right
never to have their data disclosed. But most Americans, I
suspect, would want to release at least some of their data,
if paid for the use of their "data rights."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Creation of such rights would immediately spark the birth
of a new kind of firm, specializing in brokering such rights
on behalf of private individuals. Everyone consenting to any
release of personal information would retain a data rights
agent, who would establish a computerized account for each
client. Every time an organization sold or traded its mailing
list, it would be legally obliged to collect royalties for
the individuals concerned, along with its own fees for the
sale. Once a year, let's say, such royalties would be
forwarded to the agent, and thence to the individual.
   The feasibility of such procedures is assured by the same
technologies that make computerized mass marketing possible
in the first place. Computers excel at keeping track of
billions of discrete items of data, and processing them
quickly and cheaply. Registering, and paying for, the
hundreds of millions of data exchanges that fuel mass
marketing would be demanding. But it would be no more
demanding than tracking the income sources of millions of
less-than-universally-cooperative taxpayers, or indeed, than
targeting individuals for personalized mass-market appeals in
the first place.
   The economics would clearly attract both consumers as
participants and entrepreneurs as agents. Imagine a family
that receives, say, five hundred items of junk mail per year.
Royalties of $0.20 per item would yield an annual payment of
$100minus, to be sure, a certain percentage as commission to
the agent. The agent would have a healthy and well-informed
interest in monitoring the release of personal data and
making sure that all such transactions resulted in royalty
payments. Agents would compete with one another in securing
high royalties for their clients and in ensuring that all
royalties due were paid.
   Best of all, establishing this new right over personal
data would simultaneously reduce the quantity of unsolicited
communications and raise their quality. If commercial users
of personal data had to compensate individuals for attending
to these appeals, they would surely be more selective in
making them.
   Who could oppose this elegantly simple and flexible
privacy protection measure? Only organizations that now
appropriate personal data for nothing. Their inevitable
protest will be that establishing individual data rights will
undermine the "free flow" of information. But under present
conditions, such freedom reigns for everyone except the
"private" parties whose lives are the targets of these
transactions. Nor would this proposal limit vigorous public
discourse. Creating individual data rights would constrain
only the sale or trading of information for commercial use,
not disclosure for journalistic presentation or for public
debate.
   Celebrities have long held the right to profit from, or to
deny altogether, the commercial appropriation of their names.
"Private" citizens deserve no less say in the commercial
exploitation of their lives.

   ZAMBIAN DEMOCRACY

   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, reacting to growing
pressure from pro-democracy activists, launched a campaign
against the revival of a multiparty system in Zambia.
   Mr. Kaunda, who abolished political pluralism in 1973,
accused the pro-democracy movement of receiving funds from
outside the country and of abusing the freedom to campaign
ahead of a referendum on multiparty rule.
   Economic hardship sparked riots in June, and 27 people
were killed. Afterward, Mr. Kaunda promised a referendum on
the multiparty issue in October but later postponed it until
next August.
   The pro-democracy movement, which has received powerful
church backing, is due to hold its first public rally on
Saturday in Kabwe, 125 miles north of Lusaka.
   Mr. Kaunda said an extraordinary national council in
mid-September would consider proposals by a parliamentary
committee on ways to make the ruling United National
Independence Party more democratic. These include
restrictions on presidential tenure to two five-year terms
and open elections for the post.
                                                                                                       

   SOVIET PRESS LAW
                                                                                                       

   The government newspaper Izvestia became the first Soviet
publication to register under a new press law guaranteeing
freedom from decades of state censorship. Meanwhile, the
State Press Committee announced a doubling in the price of
many publications, citing increases in the cost of paper,
printing equipment and transportation. Book prices are also
expected to more than double, officials said.
                                                                                                       

   BRITAIN'S UNSTATELY HOMES
                                                                                                       

   An Englishman's home may be his castle, but a record
14,390 British homeowners had their houses repossessed in the
first half this year, double the number of repossessions in
the second half of last year, the Council of Mortgage Lenders
reported. Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building
Societies Association, said continuing high interest rates --
around 15% -- were the main cause of the sharp rise in
repossessions. The previous repossession record, 11,700 in
the first half of 1987, was related to a miners' strike.

   Pakistani President Ghulam Ishaq Khan issued an ordinance
allowing convicted murderers to financially compensate heirs
of their victims in exchange for clemency. The order is
effective for six months, after which it requires the
approval of parliament.
                                                                                                       

   IRAQ'S ASIAN GAMES
                                                                                                       

   Iraq will send athletes to the Asian Games in China, an
Iraqi embassy spokesman in Beijing said. The report in a
Japanese press agency said there is growing concern that
Iraq's presence at the games along with other Arab teams may
disrupt the event because of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The
games are scheduled for Sept. 22 to Oct. 6.
                                                                                                       

   LUMBERING EAST GERMANY
                                                                                                       

   East German farmers and lumbermen, among the workers
hardest hit by the massive changes sweeping their country,
drove tractors, combines and lumber trucks into West Berlin
to demand higher wages, job security and other help from the
East and West German governments. Imports from the West have
cut demand for East German products. Inefficiency is another
bone of contention: "We have such old machines, some of them
made before the war," said 20-year-old protester Alexander
Witt. "We're supposed to compete in a capitalist system, but
it's hard with such old machines that often break down and
need repairs and maintenance."
                                                                                                       

   VIOLENT BANGLADESH DOCTORS
                                                                                                       

   Striking doctors trying to force the withdrawal of new
medical rules attacked the office of the director of Dhaka
Medical College Hospital and threatened widespread violence.
   Witnesses said groups of young doctors stormed the office
of Director Mohammad Anwar Ali Chowdhury, broke furniture and
set fire to his chair. Patients, many of whom have lacked
care for weeks, took cover as chanting doctors marched toward
the director's room, a witness said.
   Medical services in Bangladesh have been at a virtual
standstill, except for emergency cases, since July 28, when
15,000 doctors, the vast majority of Bangladesh's practicing
physicians, went on strike. They are trying to force
President Hossain Mohammad Ershad to withdraw proposed rules
requiring specialists to stop private practice and junior
doctors to work in villages under rural authorities.
   Doctors have denounced the rules as infringing upon their
professional freedom, saying they will resign unless the
government meets their demands.

   More than 220,000 Czechs who suffered under Communist rule
will probably share around $95 million in compensation.
Officials said those eligible include people subjected to
political trials between the Communist Party's takeover of
power in 1948 and its ousting less than a year ago. . . .
Students in Shanghai were warned by an official newspaper
against using Chinese renminbi, the "people's money," to make
intricate origami handicraft figures. The Youth Post said the
folding-money fad "shows a lack of respect and also increases
the burden on banks."

   GM to Postpone
   Plant Closure
   For Five Years

   Accord at Flint, Mich., Plant
   May Be Model in Talks
   With UAW Nationwide

   FLINT, Mich. -- General Motors Corp. settled a potentially
crippling strike here by agreeing to postpone a planned plant
shutdown for five years to allow time for most workers at the
facility to reach retirement age.
   The pact, which contains stronger job security guarantees
than at any other Big Three operation, could become a model
in the current bargaining for a nationwide agreement between
GM and the United Auto Workers union. That's because it
balances union demands for job security with GM's desire to
pare its aging work force. GM officials have said that
retirement and attrition could solve much of the company's
current overstaffing problem, provided the union agreed to
allow the shrinkage to take place over several years.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Following a six-day walk out, workers at a unit here of
GM's A.C. Rochester division approved the contract and its
five-year offer of job security by a 97% margin.
   The job security promises -- never before made for longer
than three years -- satisfied workers. Only a day earlier,
the workers had vowed to hobble GM's North American
operations indefinitely to dramatize their distress over
plans to shut down a portion of their plant and lay off 600
workers by 1992.
   According to the agreement, GM will guarantee the jobs of
all 3,108 workers employed at the plant, including the 600
employees targeted for layoff and another 600 whose jobs were
lost to outside suppliers. The auto maker also agreed to
spend $21.3 million upgrading equipment in the plant and to
seek out other components that workers could build at the
plant.
   Some top union officials expressed surprise at how far GM
came their way. "We didn't anticipate coming out with the
type of agreement that we got," said Reuben Burks, the UAW
regional director and an executive board member of the UAW.
   But UAW officials were quick to seize on the precedent.
   "What's been done {here} should be a model for the
corporation," said Michael Grimes, the top union official at
the AC plant.
   GM had powerful reasons to settle this dispute quickly.
The A.C. Rochester plant supplies 55% of the gas tanks for
GM's North American vehicle operations, as well as other
critical components.
   Because most GM plants don't stock heavy inventories of
parts in an effort to hold down warehousing costs, it was
only a day after the A.C. Rochester picket lines went up that
GM was forced to close two assembly plants. Three more closed
over the weekend, and another closed yesterday. UAW workers
were scheduled to go back to work at the Flint parts plant
last night. It was unclear whether any more assembly
operations will have to shut down before the supply lines are
refilled.
   Still, GM's agreement to postpone the closure of one of
the five operating units at the A.C. Rochester facility was
an unusual step, particularly in light of the trouble the GM
has had making its vast parts-making operations competitive.
   GM Chairman Robert Stempel, at the outset of national
bargaining talks last month, cited the high cost of parts
that GM produces for its own cars as a key competitive
disadvantage. GM builds a higher percentage of its own parts
than either Ford Motor Co. or Chrysler Corp.
   GM had planned to cut 900 jobs at the A.C. Rochester plant
over the next two years, a reduction of about 29% from the
current work force. But now those plans are on hold until at
least 1995.
   The five-year promise may be all GM needs to make. The
average age of workers at the plant is 47 years and the
average senority is 24 years. Many workers are like Levertis
Wynn, who has worked for GM for 25 years and will have enough
seniority to retire in five years. "I feel better now than I
did before, because I still have a job," he says.

   Goldman Names

   NEW YORK -- Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., the last of Wall
Street's big private investment banks, said Robert E. Rubin
and Stephen Friedman will become senior partners and
co-chairmen.
   They succeed John L. Weinberg, who retires as senior
partner and chairman Nov. 30.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Messrs. Rubin, 51 years old, and Friedman, 52, have been
heirs apparent to the job since John Whitehead resigned as
co-chairman six years ago, leaving Mr. Weinberg in sole
control. Since 1987, Messrs. Rubin and Friedman have been
co-vice chairmen, a post Goldman says it has no plans to
fill.
   The appointments mark the end of the old guard at the
121-year-old firm: The Whitehead-Weinberg team at Goldman
dates back to the early 1950s. And it represents a return to
the unusual co-chairmanship style of management at Goldman,
which many consider one of the best-run firms on Wall Street.
   Mr. Rubin says he and his partner will continue to
"modernize Goldman Sachs. Make sure it's an international
firm, make sure it's an effective presence in Europe." But
basically "continue to do the things we've been doing," he
says.
   During his 14 years as senior partner, Mr. Weinberg, 65,
oversaw a rapidly growing firm. Goldman's equity capital
during that time grew to $2.3 billion from about $80 million,
and the firm's annual profits have jumped tenfold.
   Despite its success, however, Goldman has dealt with
several sensitive issues in recent years. It has withstood
the 1987 arrest and subsequent guilty plea of Robert M.
Freeman, Goldman's powerful head of risk arbitrage, on
insider trading charges, although the firm has never been
sanctioned for Mr. Freeman's activities.
   Mr. Weinberg says the firm is in "excellent condition."
Mr. Weinberg, who will continue with the firm as senior
chairman, said in a memo to employees that Goldman "has a
strong capital position and our earnings are currently
somewhat ahead of last year's results." He wouldn't
elaborate, but said the company's results this year will fall
short of its record year in 1988.
   The succession will surely lead to changes, even at a firm
as steeped in tradition as Goldman, analysts say. Because of
a jump in the firm's partners the last several years --
Goldman now has 128 -- Messrs. Rubin and Friedman will face
increasing pressure to boost the firm's pretax income,
analysts say.
   "There will be more emphasis on areas of the business that
provide a steady stream of revenue," says Perrin Long, senior
securities analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.
   Goldman is likely to place more emphasis on money
management, which provide steady fees even when markets
falter. Indeed, Goldman recently launched its first stock
mutual fund that caters to small investors; the GS Capital
Growth Fund requires a minimum investment of just $1,200. And
Goldman also just raised about $700 million for a fund that
would invest large amounts of cash in a small number of
financially strapped companies.
   The firm may also look to provide more innovative types of
financing, analysts and securities executives say. And it is
likely to bolster its already-strong global presence, given
the success there of rival Morgan Stanley Group Inc.
   "This suggests that Goldman will change its stripes a
little bit and not be as ultraconservative," Mr. Long says.
   Still, the announced appointments fit Goldman's reputation
for methodical management changes.
   Goldman is "very sensitive to succession. You don't see
many abrupt senior-management changes at that firm," says
Kenneth Leibler, president and chief operating officer of
Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.'s Liberty Financial Cos. in
Boston and former president of the American Stock Exchange.
"They probably operate in the smoothest fashion of any
securities firm in terms of planned transitions."
   What won't change with the new appointments, securities
executives say, is Goldman's aversion to the junk bonds and
temporary "bridge" loans that tripped up much of Wall Street
in the late 1980s. But the firm will continue to forge ahead
as an underwriting powerhouse, particularly in stock
offerings, analysts say.
   This year through Aug. 13, Goldman ranked No. 2 behind
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in disclosed fees from underwriting
stocks and bonds, taking in $193.9 million on 137 issues, for
a 13.7% market share, according to Securities Data Co.
   Goldman in recent years has talked of issuing shares to
the public, but rejected the idea. Asked if Goldman would
ever go public, Mr. Weinberg said no. "But forever is a long
time," he added.
   Attempts at dual leaders typically have failed on
ego-sensitive Wall Street. But Mr. Weinberg says his
successors won't have such problems: "They're very
simpatico." Mr. Rubin said clients will know early on that he
and Mr. Friedman are equals.
   "Weinberg and Whitehead used to have a saying: `If you
post one of us, you post both of us,'" Mr. Rubin said.
   Messrs. Rubin and Friedman say they have no grand plans
for changing the firm's philosophy or strategy, except to
continue to "modernize" Goldman Sachs, which includes new
services, locations and products. Instead, the two plan to
address issues as they come up.
   "I can't today think of a single thing I'm frustrated
about" and would like to do different, Mr. Friedman says.
   Image-conscious Goldman has faced several civil lawsuits
over the past year stemming from alleged personal and
professional abuses by Goldman partners, including highly
publicized sexual harrassment allegations against a top
Goldman partner, Lewis Eisenberg, who subsequently resigned.
Mr. Eisenberg denied the harrassment allegations.
   Nevertheless, executives agree that Goldman is under
scrutiny for how it treats and promotes its women employees.
Later this year, Goldman will appoint a number of new
partners, as it does every two years. The firm currently has
only one woman partner. Mr. Rubin said that Goldman "has a
large number of very attractive candidates" for partners,
including women.
   Messrs. Rubin and Friedman, who both have law degrees,
have worked together in various positions at the firm,
including co-heads of the fixed-income department from 1985
to 1988. Mr. Rubin, who is active in Democratic politics and
raised funds for presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, has
handled much of Goldman's dealings with the public in recent
years. He joined the firm in 1966, became partner in 1971, a
member of the management committee in 1980 and co-vice
chairman in 1987.
   Before co-heading fixed income, he headed Goldman's
trading and arbitrage division; he also has had management
responsibility for J. Aron &amp; Co., the firm's commodity and
foreign-exchange subsidiary.
   Mr. Friedman joined Goldman in 1966, was elected partner
in 1973, became a member of the management committee in 1982
and vice chairman in 1987. Among other things, he headed
Goldman's mergers and acquisitions department.
   Although they will work together, Messrs. Rubin and
Friedman will gravitate toward different areas. For example,
Mr. Rubin tends to focus on clients in Mexico, Spain and
Puerto Rico, while Mr. Friedman focuses on clients in France
and the U.S. West Coast. The two new co-chairmen say
expanding globally is a priority; the firm is opening a
Frankfurt office this autumn, its first in Germany.
   But Goldman will concentrate on European countries with
developed markets, rather than some of the fledgling
democracies in Eastern Europe.
   "It's very hard to do equity offerings when people don't
know what stocks are, don't have a stock exchange and don't
have convertible currencies," Mr. Friedman said.

   Texaco Sets Pact
   With Soviet Union
   On Oil Reserves

   NEW YORK -- Texaco Inc. said it struck an agreement with
the Soviet Union that could give the company access to some
of that country's most promising oil reserves, possibly
within a few years.
   Texaco officials expect to begin almost immediately a
feasibility study defining joint production possibilities.
The study will focus on the Timan-Pechora region, which
encompasses a number of potential oilfields straddling the
Arctic Circle. Reserves there are estimated at about five
billion barrels of oil. On that basis, the region could equal
many of the huge fields that make up North Sea oil
production, industry experts estimate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, Texaco officials said they were negotiating
to secure opportunities in the refining and marketing sector
of Soviet business. An agreement hasn't yet been reached, and
Texaco wouldn't elaborate.
   "This is a significant opportunity; we need each other,"
said Harold Zimmerman, Texaco general manager of exploration
and production who has taken part in the negotiations with
the Soviet Union.
   In light of the oil crisis in the Persian Gulf region, "it
offers potential for another supply of crude," he said.
"Under one production scheme the field could yield oil by
early 1992 or 1993."
   The Soviet Union is the world's largest producer of oil,
with output currently around 12 million barrels a day.
Because of its weakening economy, however, the country has
had trouble properly maintaining its existing oil fields and
hasn't had financial resources to develop what are believed
to be vast amounts of undiscovered oil and natural gas. If
the Soviet Union can attract foreign investment to help
improve production, it also may be able to raise more badly
needed hard currency through oil exports.
   Texaco joins a growing list of major oil companies seeking
opportunities in the Soviet Union. Chevron Corp. and Elf
Aquitaine, the French petroleum company, both recently
concluded agreements granting them exploration and production
rights. Many other oil companies are in negotiations,
including British Petroleum Co.
   Texaco claimed its agreement with the Soviets is
especially broad, encompassing a larger initial geographical
area than those being explored by other oil companies and
allowing for study of potential operations in other regions.
   Texaco said no money has changed hands; a production
agreement is being negotiated. As a result, the company said
it isn't certain yet how much it may actually spend in the
Soviet Union. The company said those negotiations will run
concurrently with the drilling feasibility study about to
begin. Texaco officials expect the study to take about nine
months, and if that is successful, they believe they could
almost immediately set a drilling and production schedule.
   "The Timan-Pechora region holds significant potential for
early production," said Paul B. Hicks Jr., president of
Texaco Europe.
   As part of the overall agreement, Texaco will cooperate on
geological research with the Soviet Ministry of Geology,
including the supplying and installing computer facilities at
the ministry's Moscow offices. Texaco will also help train
Soviet personnel.
   In advance of yesterday's agreement, Soviet oil officials
have spent several weeks in Texaco offices in Houston and at
the company's Harrison, N.Y., headquarters. In Houston, the
Soviets examined computer facilities. In Harrison, the
director general of the ministry and others engaged in a
two-week business seminar. "Basically they were learning
Western business ways -- the basic financials of running an
oil business," said Mr. Zimmerman.
   Texaco began its quest in the Soviet Union by purchasing
four of six geological data packages offered by a London
broker licensed by the Soviet Union to sell such information
on its oil regions. Texaco paid about $750,000 for each
package. Packages are still being offered and Texaco
officials estimated they now go for $1 million each.
   Although acquiring access to Soviet oil is desirable, it
can be "frustrating," said Mr. Zimmerman. Talks "don't unfold
like they do in Western negotiations; there's a lot more
bureaucracy. There are problems knowing who in the Soviet
government has control over what resources."
   Texaco decided to center its exploration on potential oil
fields west of the Ural mountains. Company officials said
that better infrastructure exists there and with it chances
for earlier production. The eastern sectors were considered
too remote.

   Rule of Law:
   Victims Wonder, Who Guards the Ethics Guardians?

   "My diary was written not only from a need not to forget
but also as a kind of warning: for those who have never left
their homeland, for those who have never shed innocence, for
those who cannot imagine the loss of freedom, this book is a
reminder that there is another side of night."
   -- Juliana Pilon, from the foreward of "Notes From the
Other Side of Night"

   As a teen-ager, Mrs. Pilon and her family escaped
Ceausescu's Romania and a decade ago wrote about a return
trip. Vigilant as she might have been about governments that
persecute, Mrs. Pilon could not have imagined the nightmare
she and her husband, Roger, would endure because of the U.S.
government, because of the Justice Department no less.
   The story of what happened to the Pilons is partly a tale
of how people in Washington can be victims of "ethics"
charges. They were falsely and publicly cited in an ethics
report by the Justice Department for the serious crime of
leaking classified documents to the South African government.
The most curious aspect of the case is that this report was
issued after the Justice Department had cleared the Pilons.
   To his credit, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh last month
approved an apology to the Pilons and an unprecedented
$25,000 settlement. On the other hand, the problem remains of
unexplained misfeasance -- or malfeasance -- by ethics
officers whose power shields them from internal scrutiny.
   The Pilons were central-casting quality young Reaganites.
They met as philosophy graduate students at the University of
Chicago. When they came to Washington, Mr. Pilon served in
several positions, including head of Justice's Asylum Policy
and Review office. The trouble began in 1987 when Mrs. Pilon,
who was at the Heritage Foundation, was nominated to become
an assistant secretary of the interior. There was a problem
in her background check. The FBI set up simultaneous but
separate interviews with the Pilons, demanding to know if Mr.
Pilon had leaked to his wife a State Department document,
"Report to Congress on Communist Influence in South Africa."
She was asked if she then passed it on to a South African
diplomat.
   Both denied the accusations, but according to the Pilons,
officers from Justice's ethics office, the Office of
Professional Responsibility, told Mr. Pilon his security
clearance had been lifted and he was put on leave. Mrs.
Pilon's nomination was eventually withdrawn. Finally, the
Pilons say, ethics chief Michael Shaheen told Mr. Pilon to
resign or be fired. The Pilons' lawyer, Terrance O'Donnell,
proposed that he be allowed to see the evidence and produce a
classified rebuttal.
   Mr. O'Donnell's report went all the way to Attorney
General Edwin Meese, who ordered a review of the allegations.
In September 1988, a top Justice aide, Dee Benson, sent a
letter dropping all charges and reinstating Mr. Pilon. The
letter said "no implications adverse to you should be taken,"
thanking him for "the outstanding cooperation and patience
you have demonstrated." Mrs. Pilon, who now runs the National
Forum Foundation, guesses that the FBI wiretapped a
conversation in which she offered a South African diplomat a
copy of a Heritage Foundation study about Soviet activity at
the United Nations.
   Mr. Pilon, who is now with the CATO Institute, recalls
that the investigation "was so psychologically debilitating
because we were never told what the problem was, and so were
always flailing at shadows." The most bizarre aspect of what
the Pilons call their Kafkaesque experience is that it only
got worse after the charges were dropped.
   This past November, Mr. Shaheen's office issued its annual
report on ethics investigations. It described four
"representative" investigations of the more than 400
conducted during the year. The first described a Justice
lawyer who "was the subject of a foreign counterintelligence
investigation." The report said the investigation found "that
sufficient cause existed to terminate his political
apppointment." No names were used, but reporters quickly
learned it referred to Mr. Pilon. This was the first public
mention of the case.
   The Pilons were outraged. Mr. Pilon told a congressional
committee that power had "corrupted" Mr. Shaheen. Mr.
Thornburgh had his deputy, Donald Ayer, investigate. This
past March the Pilons were cleared for the second time, with
Mr. Ayer noting that Mr. Pilon had returned to his job
"unconditionally." Mr. Ayer then sent a follow-up letter in
April saying that "the OPR report was erroneous in certain
particulars, but that Michael Shaheen and OPR cannot be
faulted in any way." This did more than leave open the
question of whose fault it was. Mr. Ayer was soon forced to
resign in part, according to Mr. Thornburgh's aides, because
he had no authorization to clear Mr. Shaheen.
   Mr. Thornburgh ordered a third review of the case. The
latest apology plus the cash settlement was issued by
Assistant Attorney General Stuart Gerson, who says Justice
wanted to "do the fair thing" by covering the Pilons' legal
costs.
   The mystery remains how the ethics office could have
issued a report smearing the Pilons. Ethics officials knew
the details of the case. Mr. Benson, who is now the U.S.
Attorney in Utah, confirms that he had informed
representatives from the ethics office back in September
1988, that the investigation of the Pilons had ended with no
evidence of wrongdoing.
   If Mr. Shaheen issued the annual report despite knowledge
that Mr. Pilon had been cleared, this might be a case of J.
Edgar Shaheen. Mr. Shaheen has been the only director of the
post-Watergate ethics office, which was formed in 1976.
Longevity may breed a dangerous insularity. Mr. Shaheen did
not return phone calls.
   No one at the Justice Department seems very interested in
digging deeper to find out how the false ethics report could
have been issued. They may not want to be accused of somehow
interfering. Or maybe they fear being smeared themselves; the
ethics office has initiated investigations of several past
attorneys general. It's worth noting, though, that Mr.
Shaheen's office may be redundant. Last year, Congress forced
several departments, including Justice, to create an office
of inspector general to investigate alleged wrongdoing.
   Mr. Pilon would like to get to the bottom of all this and
says, "it is appalling that there are not better
institutional protections against this kind of abuse." Mrs.
Pilon's book meanwhile will be published this year in Romania
and Poland. Maybe she should add a postscript reminding the
newly liberated countries that justice does not always come
easily even in the most advanced nations.

   Treasury's Funding of Mexico Loan
   Challenged by House Banking Chairman

   WASHINGTON -- House Banking Committee Chairman Henry
Gonzalez and the Treasury Department are getting embroiled in
an increasingly sharp tussle over the conduct of
international financial policy.
   In the opening skirmish of what seems likely to be a long
struggle, Mr. Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, accused the
Treasury of circumventing the constitutional right of
Congress to control government spending "in order to fund
both foreign currency intervention and certain parts of the
Brady plan." The Brady plan is the Bush administration's
strategy for dealing with international debt problems.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gonzalez cited a new General Accounting Office report
that says the Treasury provided Mexico a $192 million subsidy
as part of a debt agreement concluded this year. The Mexico
accord was the first under the Brady strategy, named for
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. According to the GAO, the
subsidy took the form of favorable prices on Treasury
securities the U.S. sold to Mexico. The GAO concluded that
the Treasury secretary has the authority to give such a
subsidy, but it said that "the pricing decision was neither
appropriate nor good policy."
   In testimony before the Banking Committee, the Treasury
undersecretary for international affairs, David Mulford,
vigorously defended his department's actions and denied that
the Treasury had given Mexico a subsidy.
   Mr. Gonzalez, who is concerned about the Bush
administration's use of funds that aren't subject to
congressional control, is proposing legislation to make the
Treasury's so-called exchange stabilization fund subject to
full congressional review including audits by the General
Accounting Office. The fund, which currently totals about $26
billion, is used by the Treasury to intervene in
foreign-exchange markets and to make emergency loans to other
countries.
   Mr. Gonzalez's proposal also would prohibit the Federal
Reserve from lending money to the fund. The Fed currently has
$10 billion of loans outstanding to the Treasury for the
exchange stabilization fund. These loans have helped the
Treasury intervene aggressively in foreign-exchange markets,
boosting foreign currency holdings of the Treasury and
Federal Reserve to more than $47 billion as of June from
$17.3 billion in December 1988, according to Treasury
figures.
   Mr. Mulford strongly defended the Treasury's use of the
exchange stabilization fund. He said such operations have to
be conducted quickly and confidentially and therefore must be
under the sole control of the Treasury and can't be subject
to extensive congressional scrutiny. Congress for decades has
accepted the Treasury's sole authority over the fund, he
said.
   At the heart of the quarrel about the alleged subsidy to
Mexico is the price the Treasury set on zero-coupon
securities with a face value of $30.2 billion that it sold to
Mexico on March 28. The bonds, which were sold for $2.99
billion, were used to back new bonds Mexico has since
exchanged for its old bank loans. Zero-coupon bonds only pay
interest at maturity and are therefore priced at a big
discount from their face value.
   The Treasury decided to set the price based on the 30-year
coupon bond yield on Treasury securities. If it had set the
price according to that for similar instruments called strips
-- Treasury bonds stripped of their coupons -- the new bonds
would have cost Mexico $192 million more, the GAO says.
   Mr. Mulford suggested there were special circumstances
surrounding the new Mexican bonds. He said the issue was
quite large relative to the strips market, and he noted that
the price of an earlier issue of zero-coupon bonds for Mexico
in 1988 was set according to the coupon yield. And other
countries that sold Mexico zero-coupon bonds followed a
similar price formula, Mr. Mulford maintained.
   Nevertheless, not all Mr. Mulford's colleagues at Treasury
agreed with his arguments. In testimony to Mr. Gonzalez's
committee yesterday, Allan Mendelowitz, the GAO director who
compiled the report on the Mexico bonds, said that in the
weeks before the price decision, "the Treasury had an intense
internal debate over the proper pricing of the zeros that
would be sold to Mexico."
   And Mr. Gonzalez quoted from a memo by Treasury
Undersecretary Robert Glauber arguing against the pricing
formula that eventually was used. If such a formula was used,
it said, "some might even characterize it as an unauthorized
appropriation."

   Computers --
   For Data Security,
   Computer Virus
   Is Least Problem

   Imagine a firecracker company that guards itself against
match-wielding vandals -- but allows its workers to smoke on
the job.
   Such muddled thinking is routine, say security experts,
when it comes to protecting the data, much of it explosive,
in many companies' computers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Spurred by media hype, companies have rushed to protect
their data against computer viruses, rogue software that is a
high-tech form of vandalism. By next year, some 53% of
corporate computer users will have anti-virus measures in
place, according to the National Center for Computer Crime
Data.
   That's a big jump from 22% of users in 1988, and a huge
leap from 1% in 1985, making virus-protection the
fastest-growing category of security measure tracked by the
NCCCD. Reliable estimates are hard to come by, but leaders in
the fledgling anti-virus industry estimate that the field has
anywhere from $25 million to over $100 million in annual
sales.
   Still, data-security experts say viruses, which jam up
computers and sometimes destroy files, are at worst a minor
annoyance for most companies. Indeed, they say, fear of
viruses may be diverting attention from more mundane, but far
more effective, security measures that many companies have
been slow to adopt.
   This concern was thrown into sharp relief Monday, when a
fire at an electrical substation blacked out part of lower
Manhattan and threw the financial district into more
confusion than any virus has caused. While no major financial
institution admitted to losing data, several key stock and
commodity exchanges were forced to halt trading as their
computers shut down.
   Many financial firms, already hyperaware of data security,
said the experience should reinforce an emerging sense that
viruses, while important, are the least of their worries.
   "If you're alert, you should be able to prevent and
control viruses," says Walter Brenner, a Credit Lyonnais S.A.
senior vice president who spent yesterday at a computer
disaster-recovery facility operated by Comdisco Inc. in North
Bergen, N.J. "Something like {the blackout}, you have no
control over. You simply have to be prepared." Credit
Lyonnais lost no work in the power outage, he adds, but
completed many transactions later than usual.
   Rick Morrison of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which ran
its computers on emergency power for most of Monday, agrees:
"We'll continue to do a lot to prevent viruses, but this
stuff has to be our meat and potatoes."
   Other meat-and-potatoes measures, say security experts,
include denying people access to information they don't need
to do their jobs; guarding against sloppy input of
information; making extra copies of all vital information;
guarding against actual theft of computers; preparing for
natural disasters; and making sure company policy is
understood.
   But the fear of viruses persists. "Every time I start
advising a company, I have to spend the first few days
disabusing them of the notion that viruses are their biggest
problem," gripes Robert Courtney, a computer consultant based
in Port Ewen, N.Y.
   Mr. Courtney and others say outsiders account for only
about 3% of data-security losses, measured in dollars. And
viruswriters are only a portion of those outsiders. That
pales beside the whopping 50%-65% most experts say is lost
through avoidable mistakes, such as clerks keying in the
wrong account number without being prompted to double-check
entries.
   Along with power failures, another underestimated security
problem, according to Mr. Courtney, is water. "Leaking roofs
do three times as much damage to computer data as all the
virus writers in the world put together," he says. "But
people don't want to hear that. They like their problems to
be intellectually titillating; they don't want to deal with
dumb clerks or broken pipes."
   Even in the category of outright computer crime, estimated
to cost U.S. companies about $1 billion a year, viruses come
low on the totem pole. "In relation to all other problems,
I'd have to say it's at the bottom," says Ronald Keelan, a
former International Business Machines Corp. security expert
who works as a consultant in Larchmont, N.Y.
   Mr. Keelan says most computer crime can be stymied by
screening personnel and restricting access to computers,
since disgruntled and dishonest employees are the main
culprits. Guarding against viruses is easy and a good idea,
he says, but it shouldn't detract from more basic issues:
"That's like building a house, installing a fancy burglar
alarm, and then leaving a big hole in the wall."
   (One exception to this rule, he notes, is university
campuses, where computer viruses have become the most serious
data-security problem.)
   Still, companies are increasingly enamored of the bells
and whistles of anti-virus software even though computer
viruses are spread by very specific types of action and are
easy to prevent -- often using free software. In addition,
most computer viruses are easy to recover from, especially if
a company routinely makes backup copies of its software and
data.
   But the media's focus on viruses has mesmerized top
management, says Ivan Brass, director of information services
for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. "With viruses, the
biggest fear is that you'll end up on the front page," he
says. Concern about that kind of bad publicity "changes
spending patterns," he adds.
   But like other security professionals, Mr. Brass is loath
to discourage any trend that makes people more aware of data
security -- especially when the threat from viruses, though
relatively small, is real. "Without the publicity," he says,
"we wouldn't be as far along in protecting computers as we
are today."
   Fear of viruses can also be used to justify other, more
strategic expenditures. "I know lots of security people who
use instances {of virus attacks} in the press to leverage
their buying," says Kim Bell of Computer Associates, which
sells security software.
   Observes Buck BloomBecker, director of NCCCD and a
crusader for computer security: "If we want people to buy {a
particular security product}, all we have to do is say it's
the best way to fight viruses."
   Not everyone agrees that viruses have been blown out of
proportion. "It causes more damage than any other security
problem," asserts John McAfee of McAfee Associates, an
anti-virus software and consulting company in Santa Clara,
Calif. "Anyone who says it's a lower priority just hasn't
been hit yet."
   Mr. McAfee takes issue with the statistics cited by most
consultants, saying the vast majority of damage from viruses
goes unreported. Though he won't name names, he says he knows
of several big corporations that have lost "tens of millions
of dollars" because of virus attacks, which he says are
proliferating.
   "This is something no one talks about," he says. "I've
never had a client who had any interest whatsoever in
publicity about his company's problems."
   But most experts, while agreeing that many companies
probably hush up virus attacks, contend that only a negligent
company could lose a large amount of data to a virus. "It's
an inconvenience, not a large monetary or data loss," says
Bill Vance, director of secure systems for IBM.
   Clifford Stoll, who recounted his battles with a computer
"hacker" in a recent bestselling book, agrees: "The main
thing spread by viruses is paranoia."

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- The Florida Public Service Commission
approved an $11.8 million annual rate increase for Gulf Power
Co., but fined the Southern Co. unit a total of $4.6 million
for "mismanagement."
   Gulf had sought a $26 million rate increase.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The commission set a $2.3 million penalty for each of two
years, citing, among other factors, Gulf's guilty plea last
October on charges related to illegal political
contributions. In recommending a penalty, the commission's
staff said the company's president, Douglas McCrary, "should
have known" about Gulf's problems sooner and taken quicker
action.
   John Hutchinson, a Gulf spokesman, said the Pensacola,
Fla.-based company believes that the penalty is
"unwarranted," noting that ". . . no management system in the
world can prevent an individual from committing illegal
acts." He said Gulf may appeal the ruling in court.
   Separately, two special agents with the Internal Revenue
Service filed suit against Gulf Power in federal court last
week, alleging the company conducted illegal credit checks on
them in an effort to discredit their investigation of Gulf.
It was the IRS investigation that led to Gulf's guilty plea
last fall. The IRS continues to examine the actions of
individuals involved in the political contributions scheme.
   Mr. Hutchinson acknowledged that "someone" at Gulf had
requested the credit checks, which he said were not made for
the usual purpose of verifying credit before extending credit
for appliances sold by Gulf. He said, "We don't know who did
it, but we know Jake Horton was in charge of the appliance
division through which it (the credit checks) was ordered."
   Jacob F. "Jake" Horton, a former senior vice president at
Gulf, has emerged as a central figure in the illegal
political contributions scheme. He died in a mysterious crash
of a corporate plane in April 1989.

   New Jersey Moves
   To Block ITT Units
   On Insurance Sales

   New Jersey moved to block ITT Corp. from selling any
insurance in the state if an ITT unit continues efforts to
withdraw from the auto insurance market.
   Insurance Commissioner Samuel Fortunato directed all ITT
units to surrender their certificates to sell insurance if
the one unit selling auto insurance, Twin City Fire Insurance
Co., goes ahead with plans to stop selling its lines.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The commissioner's order is the latest development in a
dispute over the state's new auto-insurance law. Proponents
of the law, which was enacted this year, say it is meant to
reduce rates and relieve the financial troubles of a fund
that had been established to insure high-risk drivers.
   But an ITT spokeswoman said Twin City has projected
"severe losses" under the law. The company has challenged the
law in court, so far without success.
   A spokesman for the state insurance department said it was
moving against ITT because Twin City was further along than
other insurers in trying to pull out of auto insurance in the
state. He said several others have made "overtures" about
pulling out, while still other insurers have approached the
department about starting new auto insurance lines in New
Jersey.
   Gov. Jim Florio said in a statement that the insurance
commissioner was acting under a "long arm" provision that
empowers the state to act against companies who balk at the
law. "If they won't sell us car insurance, we won't let them
sell us anything," he said.
   ITT, based in New York, didn't have any immediate comment
on the order. But the spokeswoman said it would affect 10 of
the company's certified insurance subsidiaries doing business
in New Jersey.
   She said the aggregate premium volume of those
subsidiaries in the state last year was $224.6 million. Of
that, she said, $72.6 million came from Twin City, though
that figure includes homeowners' lines as well as auto
insurance.
   The governor's office said Twin City insures about 23,000
cars, or 1% of the New Jersey market.
   All the ITT units affected by the order are part of the
company's ITT Hartford Insurance Group subsidiary. The
commissioner's order directs ITT Hartford to cease operations
in the state over five years at a gradual pace to protect
policyholders. The order doesn't apply to life and health
policies already in effect that can only be canceled at the
option of the insured.

   Lower Manhattan Power Outage Shows
   The Vulnerability of Electric Systems

   NEW YORK -- The blackout that hit lower Manhattan on
Monday could have been a lot worse.
   With power restored yesterday to all but 1,100 commercial
and residential customers, a handful of banks and securities
firms were still experiencing difficulties -- either shut
down or working with skeleton staffs, a few in the dark.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Their plight demonstrated the vulnerability of crowded
urban electric transmission systems to spot failures, even
when power remains plentiful.
   Despite the fire that ripped through its South Street
Seaport substation shortly after noon, Consolidated Edison
Co. of New York was able to restore power to most of the
36-square block area blacked out in lower Manhattan's
financial district Monday within five or six hours. While the
fire effectively knocked out the "local lanes" of traffic,
Con Ed said, the "express lanes" were undamaged and available
for the restoration effort.
   The noonday fire at Con Ed initially affected all five
138,000-volt cables that run into the station. A couple of
cables automatically "tipped," or shut down, while the others
were quickly shut down by Con Ed from its Upper West Side
control center in hopes of limiting the damage. With the
cables out, thousands of Wall Street workers were plunged
into darkness, trapped in elevators and left staring at blank
computer screens.
   Because of the fire's intensity, Con Ed personnel
dispatched immediately to the usually unmanned substation,
couldn't get inside to assess the damage until midafternoon.
They discovered that the fire hadn't damaged the four cables
that simply run through the South Street station on their way
to the World Trade Center substation. According to Con Ed,
just two of those four cables are needed to serve the area
around the World Trade Center, and they were quickly
re-energized.
   The fire did, however, knock out the 13 cables that
deliver 13,000-volt power, which has been "stepped down," or
transformed from the 138,000 volts entering the substation,
to some 1,100 commercial and residential customers in the
vicinity of the South Street facility. Yesterday, Con Ed said
those 13 cables will remain out of service for the
foreseeable future, with backup generator service going only
to certain emergency power users, such as nursing homes. Con
Ed said some customers and street signals should see power
restored by tomorrow. The rest won't likely be back on line
before next Monday.
   While the nation's electric reliability concerns have
focused recently on fears of blackouts due to overburdened
generating capacity, the substation fire demonstrates another
vulnerability. The U.S. electrical grid has many
interconnections between individual utilities, forming a
number of regionwide safety nets intended to insure that
whenever a utility power plant goes down, power from other
utilities can quickly take its place. But when a key link in
a constricted transmission and distribution network goes out,
as Monday's fire demonstrated, the only recourse is to
reroute power, if possible, or repair the broken link. Con Ed
said it could take a year or more to completely repair its
burned out substation.
   Meanwhile, trading rooms at Credit Suisse were closed
yesterday, as were those at Nomura Securities Co. The
essential trading systems and market support activities at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. were up and running, albeit
on auxiliary power sources. Britain's National Westminster
Bank Corp. said portions of its New York trading room
remained inoperative. However, the bank said it was able to
disperse its trading operations to various locations in New
York, Delaware and New Jersey.
   Some currency dealers complained that some of their
computer trading screens were out, and some interdealer
brokers which act as intermediaries between traders in the
foreign exchange and U.S. government securities markets were
shut. That tended to make trading less efficient.
   Some firms just made due. Nomura employees assembled on a
sidewalk in front of the company's darkened building at 7:30
a.m. yesterday, after which unit heads dispersed their staffs
to other companies around the city. Some Nomura executives
worked out of their apartments, while Makoto Takahashi, an
executive vice president, went to work in the company's
deserted offices and kept in contact with clients using a
cellular telephone.
   What's next? "It's 7:30 on the curb every morning until
the power's back on," said Terence Dolce, a vice president of
planning at Nomura.

   NEW YORK -- Are investors fighting the last war?
   In the past week's tumult, investors have favored the same
sectors of the stock market that did well during the 1970s
oil-price shocks and pummeled most of the same losers,
according to Barra, a Berkeley, Calif., investment research
firm.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But a minority of investment strategists say that the
market may have learned too well from the inflationary jolts
of 1973-74 and 1979-80. In particular, they suggest that
investors may be acting on expectations about inflation and
interest rates that aren't justified by the current limping
economy.
   The most obvious differences that set today apart, says
Richard Hoey, U.S. chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
is that "those two oil shocks came when the economy was
closer to boom levels" and inflation was already a problem.
The result in 1973-74 was "an inflation psychology that fed
on itself," as businesses stocked up inventories and
consumers spent like there was no tomorrow. In 1979-80, the
Federal Reserve fought back with a sudden and very aggressive
monetary tightening that sent interest rates into the
stratosphere.
   Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, investors seem to be
betting that soaring inflation and interest rates are going
to be big problems again.
   For instance, in the market's roiling of recent days, gold
and oil-industry stocks -- the only reliable winners from the
inflation shocks of the 1970s -- have been virtually the only
sectors to advance. These sectors gained 3% to 8% in the
first 10 days of this month, according to Barra. That
compares with an average loss of about 6% for Barra's
1200-stock universe.
   But now, in contrast to the situation in the 1970s, credit
is relatively tight and the economy is showing signs of a
slump. That plus the fact that corporate, consumer and
government debt is much higher than it was in the 1970s leads
some analysts to argue that deflation, or falling prices,
poses a bigger threat to investors' wealth than inflation or
higher interest rates.
   For instance, fears about high debt and the general state
of the economy mean that "although oil will give a one-time
push to inflation, it won't be contagious this time," says
Michael Metz, chief market strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "I
think people will treat {higher oil prices} like an
involuntary tax on consumption -- they will reduce
consumption elsewhere, putting downward pressure on prices
generally."
   While fears of oil-spurred inflation sent bond prices
tumbling and interest rates rising in recent days, "that may
be an area where people are overreacting," says Barclays' Mr.
Hoey. "Because the economy has already crested, the major
effect {of the oil shock} will be downside on the economy,
rather than upside on interest rates."
   The main driver of oil prices now is "fear, concern, hope
or whatever that things will go further in the Middle East,"
says Richard Gordon, senior director of Petroleum Finance
Co., a Washington-based oil and gas consultants concern.
Meanwhile, investors seem content to overlook the fact that
the fundamentals of the oil market are "still pretty weak,"
he says.
   Mr. Gordon would be a long-term player in oils through
smaller independent oil companies such as Adobe Resources
Corp. and Noble Affiliates Inc., which have been "overlooked
so far in the rush to bigname companies," but he would
suggest taking some profits now in the "so-called quality
integrated companies" that have been among the market's
favorites.
   Meanwhile, even before their latest runup, gold stocks
were already anticipating a substantial rise in bullion
prices, says John Charles Potvin, senior precious metals
analyst at Burns Fry Ltd. And their recent gains have paced
bullion's own advance. At today's prices, Mr. Potvin would
still be a long-term buyer of Echo Bay Mines Ltd., American
Barrick Resources Corp. and Placer Dome Inc., but he classes
Homestake Mining Co. and Lac Minerals Ltd. as "expensive."
   Aside from the rush to oil and gold, some analysts suspect
the market might have overshot itself in the way investors
punished the potential big losers from the Iraqi fray. As a
result, those areas may offer good values now to
brave-hearted investors, some strategists say.
   For instance, life insurance stocks, which tend to rise
and fall on the asset value of their mostly fixed-income
investment portfolios, were among the hardest hit by the
latest replay of 1970s-style interest-rate fears.
   Transamerica Corp. is one stock that was "hit more than it
should have been" in recent days, says David Seifer, an
insurance analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities
Corp. Capital Holding Corp. and Torchmark Corp. also look
like good buys now, in his view.
   Other sectors where analysts say investors may have
overreacted to fears of rising rates include high dividend
stocks, such as electric utilities and telephones -- which
are normally the defensive investment of choice in bearish
times -- and interest-sensitive banks and thrifts.
   In contrast with the 1970s, "you're starting in the 1990s
with high real {inflation-adjusted} yields," Mr. Hoey says.
"If long rates stay high for a while, then drop in a
recession, high-yielding stocks will do fine."
   In the banking sector, Citicorp and Chemical Banking Corp.
"are now down to where they look interesting, at least on a
speculative basis," says Mr. Metz. While he doesn't like
cellular telephone plays, he says American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. "is a very interesting buy now, selling within
a dollar of its year's low."
   Electric utilities remain broadly attractive, in Mr.
Metz's view: "You've got three things working for you -- the
inflation fears have been overdone, the yields of these
stocks are high, and they are recession-resistant."
   Other depressed sectors that analysts say might be worth a
look today are the so-called double-whammy stocks -- such as
trucking, autos, airlines and container freight -- that not
only are very recession-sensitive but also are linked to
heavy use of oil.
   Many of those stocks were already selling at historically
low valuation levels on recession fears before the latest
sell-off began. And -- just as during previous oil-price
shocks -- they were battered even more by the latest
oil-induced sell-off.
   At current prices, several airline stocks look as cheap as
or cheaper than they were at the height of the 1979-80
oil-price surgeat least according to classic valuation
measures, such as comparing stock prices to earnings, book
value, sales and other company fundamentals, says George
Douglas, chairman of Dais Group Inc., a subsidiary of
Templeton Global Investors Inc.
   At today's prices, Delta Air Lines' price-to-book ratio is
"at a 10-year low relative to the market," he says. Delta's
price-to-cash-flow and price-to-sales are "not far from their
lows of 1985-86 and well below where they were in 1980," he
adds.
   AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, is similarly cheap
at a 60% discount to the market on a price-to-book basis, Mr.
Douglas says.
   Mr. Metz also feels that the market has "overdone it" in
trashing AMR and Delta. Among auto makers, Ford Motor Co. and
General Motors Corp. also look "awfully attractive" at
current levels, in his view.
   But while these stocks may be battered down to bargain
levels, investors who are tempted to buy them now should
remember the crucial risk of value investing: The stocks
could stay undervalued for some time.
   Ford and Chrysler Corp. were "significantly undervalued"
before the latest oil-induced sell-off and then got "really,
really walloped," says Ann Knight, auto analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. "I'd say sitting on your hands is the best
course of action for now," she says. "I'm definitely not
saying bail out, but I'm not stepping up to them yet either."

   FDIC Proposes
   Boost in Banks'
   Insurance Costs
   ---
   Agency Seeks $1.1 Billion
   Increases to Help Its Fund
   Cover Future Failures

   WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., fearful
of continued bank failures, proposed boosting bank insurance
premiums by the biggest amount in its history to raise an
extra $1.1 billion next year.
   The proposed jump is a sign that the FDIC is anxious about
ensuring that its bank insurance fund is big enough to handle
future failures without having to turn to taxpayers, who are
already angry that the bailout of the savings-and-loan
insurance fund will cost them $150 billion or more.

   "The point here is that we are increasing the cost of
deposit insurance to banks to meet a problem we are facing, a
decline in the fund," FDIC Chairman William Seidman said at a
board meeting yesterday. The proposal was passed unanimously
by the FDIC's five-person board, and is expected to be
approved after a 30-day comment period.
   The FDIC proposed to increase next year's premiums to 19.5
cents per $100 of deposits from 12 cents per $100 this year.
Last year's S&amp;L bailout bill had already mandated an increase
to 15 cents next year, but gave the FDIC the discretion to
raise the premium another 4.5 cents. The agency's proposal of
the maximum increase underlines its concern about bank
failures, especially as the economy appears to be heading
into a recession.
   The higher premiums could have a significant effect on the
banking industry. The FDIC said a $1.1 billion increase,
which would be brought in by the extra 4.5-cent assessment,
amounts to 7.3% of the industry's 1989 net income of $15
billion after taxes and nonrecurring gains. That doesn't
include the $850 million in payments that will result next
year from the increase to 15 cents from 12 cents mandated in
the bailout law.
   Nevertheless, Mr. Seidman said, the impact on the banking
industry is unclear because banks will try to pass along some
of the higher costs to their customers by lowering interest
rates paid on deposits or by increasing fees.
   In the first losses in its history, the FDIC's bank
insurance fund had deficits totaling more than $5 billion in
1988 and 1989, mostly from bailouts of banks in the
economically troubled Southwest. The losses have left the
fund standing at $13.2 billion, equal to about 70 cents per
$100 of insured deposits.
   While government policy is to maintain the fund at $1.25
per $100 of deposits, Mr. Seidman has said the bank failures
could cost the FDIC as much as $2 billion this year, which
would leave the fund at about 60 cents per $100. The fund is
a backstop for about $2 trillion in insured deposits at
banks.
   "We have a considerable way to go to bring it back to the
level at which Congress thinks it should be," Mr. Seidman
said. The FDIC chief predicted it would take at least five
years to reach the $1.25 mark. He also said "it's our hope"
that the proposed premium increase would prevent a loss by
the bank fund next year.
   Charles Cranmer, a banking analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc., said he was more concerned about whether the
increase would be enough to handle future bank failures than
about how the higher costs would affect banks. "If we're
heading into a recession, I'm not sure that will be enough,"
he said. "If we're staring at some big bank failures, then $1
billion won't make much of a difference."
   The banking industry responded guardedly to the proposal,
grudgingly accepting the premium increase as necessary, but
using it as an occasion to call for deposit-insurance
revisions aimed at lowering the government's costs in bank
bailouts.
   "Our industry has the capacity and willingness to meet our
obligation," said Donald Ogilvie, executive vice president of
the American Bankers Association. But, he said, "further
increases will place additional strain on bank earnings and
affect the industry's ability to raise capital."
   A trade group representing small community banks, the
Independent Bankers Association of America, wrote to the FDIC
last week urging the agency to consider assessing premiums on
deposits in foreign branches of U.S. banks -- which are
almost exclusively the bigger banks on the East and West
Coasts -- rather than raising premiums on domestic deposits.
   The IBAA estimated that the FDIC could raise $537 million
next year by assessing the foreign deposits at 15 cents per
$100. Technically, foreign deposits aren't insured, but the
association argues that the FDIC would never allow foreign
depositors to lose money. Assessing some other liabilities
mostly held by big banks could raise an additional $364
million, the association said.

   Census Survey on Child Care Increases
   Concern About How Much Poor Can Pay

   WASHINGTON -- A new U.S. Census Bureau survey provides a
sweeping look at how children are cared for in the U.S. and
increases concern about the ability of low-income families to
afford child care.
   The report could bolster child-care legislation under
consideration in Congress that would mainly aid low-income
families. The data are "particularly important," says Martin
O'Connell, who co-wrote the report, "especially when one
considers the amount of legislation that may be geared to
reimbursing payments for child care as a function of income."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Comparisons with a 1977 survey show that the proportion of
children in organized day care has nearly doubled over the
decade, to 24% in 1987 from 13% in 1977. During the same
period, the use of relatives as child-care providers
declined. Care provided by relatives in the child's home
dropped to 8% in 1987 from 13% in 1977, and a similar decline
was seen in child care provided by relatives in their own
homes.
   The drop probably reflects the sharp increase in the
number of working women, which reduces the potential number
of female relatives available to care for children. About 59%
of the country's estimated 52 million children under age 15
had mothers who were employed in fall 1987.
   Working parents with preschool children often have the
most critical child-care needs. In 1987, 55% of women with
children under age five were employed, up from 35% a decade
earlier.
   In total, American families with employed mothers spent
$15.5 billion on all forms of child care in 1987, at an
average weekly cost of $49. That was an increase of $8 since
the last such survey was taken in the mid-1980s.
   Such costs averaged about $35 a week, or 25% of family
income, for families with employed mothers living in poverty.
By contrast, better-off families paid an average of $50 a
week, or 6% of family income.
   The Census Bureau report is the first to detail officially
that poor families pay a higher percentage of family income
for child-care services than do better-off families. The
legislation now in Congress "would help with costs and widen
choices" for low-income families, says Helen Blank, a
child-care expert with the Children's Defense Fund, who says
the Census Bureau figures confirm earlier estimates about
family income and child care.
   The report shows that children under age five who live in
poverty depended more on in-home care by grandparents and
other relatives than did better-off children. Children of
employed mothers with family incomes over $45,000 a year were
twice as likely to be using organized child-care facilities
as were children living in families with annual incomes below
$15,000. Organized child care covers day-care centers,
nursery schools and preschools.
   Ms. Blank says studies have shown that many low-income
women would prefer the developmental benefits of center-based
preschool care when their children reach the ages of three
and four, "but they can't afford it." She recalls tragedies
where dozens of children have been grouped together in
unsafe, unlicensed but cheap neighborhood day-care homes. "Is
that by choice?" she asks.
   The report also confirms what many employers have already
learned: that worries about child care can cost working
parents time and productivity on the job. About 7% of the
nine million women surveyed with children in some kind of
child care reported losing some time from work in the
previous month as a result of a breakdown in their child-care
arrangement.
   But the report shows that most families with working
mothers don't pay for child-care services. Only about
one-third of the 19 million employed women with children
under age 15 pay for child-care services, because most of
them have school-age children who are in school most of the
day and cared for after school in informal arrangements with
friends or neighbors.
   Most preschool-age children, or 66%, were cared for in
their own homes or in a provider's home while their mothers
were at work. Organized child-care facilities provided the
primary care for 2.2 million children under age five. An
additional 9% of preschoolers are cared for by their mothers
while working. About one-fourth of those mothers are employed
as private household workers or child-care workers.
   More than one-fourth of the 29 million children of
employed mothers also had a second child-care arrangement
during the day to cover the time before or after school,
based on the data collected in 1987. The report said that 22%
of these children looked after themselves. That proportion of
so-called "latchkey" children and most other data on
child-care arrangements hadn't significantly changed since
the last survey in 1984-85.

   Commodities:
   Gold, a Traditional Haven,
   Rallies in Mideast Crisis...

   Gold, the classic hedge against surging inflation and
international turmoil, is back.
   In the past three days, the price of gold for immediate
delivery has leaped 7% to $411.50 an ounce from $383.60, as
measured by the London gold fixing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After falling as low as $346 an ounce in June, gold has
rebounded in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the
military response by other nations and the sudden 50% price
jump in crude oil. In the past few days, buying has come from
most parts of the world: the Middle East, Europe, the Far
East, and the U.S.
   In New York, where gold futures are traded, the December
contract has risen more than $19 in the past three days, to
$414 an ounce. It rose as high as $424.70 yesterday morning
before falling back to $414, unchanged from the last trade
reported on Monday, when New York trading was disrupted by an
electrical blackout.
   Reports that Iraq has seized about $1 billion worth of
gold in Kuwait helped bring the price down from its morning
high, traders said. The concern is that Iraq will sell gold
to finance purchases of arms or food.
   Also, reports yesterday that Jordan's King Hussein will
visit the U.S. helped to bring down oil prices and, in turn,
gold prices because gold rises with inflation fears. But
those same fears will help propel it further in coming
months, many traders and analysts think. "What has changed
here is the inflationary concerns," said James Kneafsey,
president of Cambridge Financial Management. "Gold is a safe
haven from inflation."
   "It wouldn't surprise me one bit" if gold reaches $450 an
ounce this year, said Bruce L. Kaplan, president of Kaplan &amp;
Co., a Santa Monica, Calif., precious-metals consulting firm.
He said he's seeing signs of strong interest by individual
investors for the first time in a couple of years.
   Sales of American Eagle gold coins totaled 29,000 ounces
in the first nine days of August, more than for the entire
month of July, said Joe Rosta of CPM Group Ltd., a New York
commodities information firm.
   Such trends are making many analysts sound bullish these
days, but having been burned several times by gold in the
past, they are predicting relatively modest price gains. Many
look for gold to hit $425 to $475 an ounce by year end. (A
price of $425 would keep an investor roughly even with
Treasury bills, which are much safer than gold.)
   In general, three forces strongly influence the price of
gold: international tension, inflation and the strength or
weakness of the dollar. (For gold, an ideal world is tense,
with high inflation and a weak dollar.) All three forces are
hard to predict, but bullish sentiment on gold is rising.
   "It's possible that this Iraq advance has marked a major
turning point in the gold market," said John Brimelow,
director of international research at Keane Securities in New
York. He said heavy selling by the Soviet Union depressed
prices earlier this year, but that Soviet selling seems to
have abated. "I think we have a reasonable chance of seeing
bullion prices over $450 by the end of this year," he said.
   Many technicians, who study price charts, regard the $425
level as critical for gold, because it has fallen back when
it hit that level before, including once earlier this year.
"If it gets to that level and holds it, people are going to
be very impressed . . . because a lot of people follow
charts," said Mr. Brimelow.
   "It is obvious that the Middle Eastern situation is
providing the momentum that is driving gold prices higher,"
said Vahid Fathi, analyst with Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc.
in Cleveland. But he sees "more fundamental reasons" why gold
should rise in the long term. The main one is that he expects
the dollar to be weak, as a weak U.S. economy leads to
falling interest rates here.
   Because the dollar and gold are considered safe havens,
they compete for dollars from frightened investors in Europe,
the Far East and elsewhere. Sometimes the two move in tandem,
but usually gold rises when the dollar falls.
   Mr. Kneafsey of Cambridge Financial Management said his
guess is that gold will end the year at between $425 and $475
an ounce, though he thinks $500 or better is possible.
   "Gold has been out of favor the last six or seven years as
an investment medium," said Harry Conger, chief executive
officer of Homestake Mining Co. "Now we are seeing a revival
of interest . . . because of political events." He thinks
South Africa, which mines 40% of the world's gold, "is going
to experience a reduction in its gold output because the cost
of social changes will be reflected in greater production
costs." His prediction: Gold will rise to $450 or $500 by
year end.
   Jeffrey A. Nichols of American Precious Metals Advisors in
Toronto thinks $420 to $430 an ounce is a likely year-end
price, but said "there's the potential for a much sharper
move." Long term, he's bullish because he said supply and
demand are in "tight" balance. Gold jewelry sales have been
rising world-wide at 24% to 26% a year, he said.
   Bernard Savaiko, analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New
York, said, "Gold is going up for the wrong reason." People
who expect a replay of the inflation of the 1970s will be
disappointed, he said, partly because the Federal Reserve
system is trying to keep a tighter lid on inflation now.
Nevertheless, he thinks it's possible that gold might reach
$435 this year.
   In other precious-metals news, December silver yesterday
showed a gain of 23 cents an ounce, settling at $5.3320,
while October platinum was up $6.20 an ounce from Friday at
$502.50, but down $3.50 from Monday's last trade of $506.00.
   After the close of trading yesterday, the Commodity
Exchange increased original margins, or good-faith money, for
gold and silver futures contracts by $400 per contract to
$1,700.
   In other markets:
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices advanced as
several professional speculators covered "short" positions by
purchasing futures contracts to offset those sold earlier on
a bet that prices would fall. One active Chicago speculator,
Richard Dennis, was rumored to have bought futures contracts
equal to as many as 10 million bushels of soybeans. Mr.
Dennis as a matter of policy doesn't comment on trading
positions he is rumored to have taken. Analysts said they
expect soybean futures prices to trade in a choppy sideways
pattern for several weeks until this year's crop is closer to
being harvested. Soybean futures for November delivery gained
6.25 cents a bushel to close at $6.26575 a bushel. December
corn futures also advanced, closing 1.25 cents a bushel
higher at $2.425. Wheat futures prices reversed a recent
slide and advanced modestly. December wheat futures gained
3.5 cents a bushel to close at $2.9425.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices were firm compared with Monday's
last trades but only moderately above Friday's close. The
September contract ended at $1.3285 a pound. This was up 2.75
cents from the last trade Monday at $1.3010, but only 0.85
cent higher than Friday's close of $1.3200. Demand for
futures contracts continued despite a rise in the London
Metal Exchange warehouse inventories of copper, which have
more than doubled over the past month. Figures released
yesterday showed an increase of 6,800 tons to 122,400 tons.
As recently as early July, these stocks were below 47,000
tons. Traders and analysts have been at a loss to explain how
prices have kept surging despite the increase in these
visible supplies. "All I can say," one analyst said, "is that
sooner or later traders are going to pay attention to the
stock increases and prices will begin to reflect these rising
supplies." Japanese demand for copper continued in London,
analysts said. Reports that a Peruvian mining union has
threatened to go on strike tomorrow also helped firm prices,
analysts said.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices were higher. The October contract
ended with a gain of 0.29 cent a pound, compared with
Monday's last trade and Friday's close. The market is being
supported by the perception that there is underlying demand
for sugar just underneath current price levels, according to
one analyst. This is particularly true with respect to China,
he said. That nation recently has bought about 250,000 tons
of sugar in several purchases and in his view will need to
buy more sugar. The analyst disputed perceptions that China
will scale back its buying and said that at the very least it
won't buy less than last year. If there is any decline in
buying, it will be very slight, he said. "China needs to buy
sugar, particularly because of its increasing population," he
said.

   DANBURY, Conn. -- First Brands Corp. reported that
increased sales of its plastic bags and automotive care
products pushed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings sharply
higher, and may improve results in the next fiscal year.
   First Brands, which said that it is continuing to solicit
bids for a sale of the company, reported earnings of $4.4
million, or 20 cents per share, for the quarter ended June
30, up from $863,000, or four cents per share, in the
year-earlier period.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company's total fourth-quarter sales, however, were
down to $248 million, from $273.3 million a year earlier.
   First Brands, which was created by a 1986 leveraged buyout
of several businesses from the Union Carbide Corp., said that
strong sales of its Glad plastic bags and wraps and its STP
automotive additives more than offset lagging sales of its
Prestone antifreeze.
   The company's chief financial officer, Donald DeSantis,
explained that antifreeze prices had fallen since an earlier
shortage of a petrochemical ingredient had eased.
   The company's Glad and STP brand products, however, have
been increasing in unit volume, sales and profitability, he
said.
   In late June, the controlling shareholders of First Brands
announced that they were seeking a buyer for all or part of
the company.
   "The process of soliciting bids to purchase the company is
continuing, and several parties have expressed an interest,"
said Alfred E. Dudley, the company's chairman, chief
executive officer, and president, in a prepared statement.
   For the fiscal year, earnings were $49.6 million, or $2.40
per share, down from $61.0 million, or $3.03 per share, in
fiscal 1989. Total sales were $1.01 billion in 1990, down
from $1.21 billion in 1989.
   The 1989 results, however, were inflated by a $15.5
million gain from the sale of the company's
household-products business in Europe. In addition, 1990
earnings were hurt by a $786,000 charge related to the
repurchase of senior subordinated debt.

   Continental Air
   Holders Sue to Stop
   Buy-Out of Lorenzo

   Several Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. shareholders
sued to stop the proposed purchase of Frank Lorenzo's stake
in the airline company by Scandinavian Airlines System.
   In addition to Mr. Lorenzo, who stepped down as chairman
and chief executive officer of Continental Holdings, the
plaintiffs also sued that company, its directors and Jet
Capital Corp., the tightly controlled holding company that
owns a special class of Continental Holdings stock. SAS was
not named in the suits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The suits -- three of them filed in Delaware Chancery
Court and a fourth filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey
-- allege that Continental directors breached their fiduciary
duty by agreeing to a buy-out in which Mr. Lorenzo and Jet
Capital's other shareholders receive $14 to $18 apiece for
their shares. In American Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, Continental Holdings shares closed at $5.25, down
87.5 cents.
   Mr. Lorenzo agreed last week to sell all his stock in
Continental Holdings to SAS and to vacate his management
posts at both the holding company and its Continental
Airlines unit, although he will remain a director. Mr.
Lorenzo would receive more than $30 million, including $10.8
million for his shares in Jet Capital, and SAS would buy most
of his stock options, also at a premium. The transaction
would boost SAS's equity stake to 16.8% from 9.8%.
   The Delaware suits charge that Mr. Lorenzo would receive
amounts vastly exceeding the value of his stock options and
his employment contract. Similarly, the New Jersey suit
claims SAS is paying Mr. Lorenzo four times the value of his
equity. The New Jersey suits ask for unspecified damages and
all the suits seek to stop the transaction.
   A Continental Holdings spokesman said the company believes
the transaction to be proper, and that it was scrutinized by
attorneys and financial advisers for all the parties
involved. "We are confident the directors will be absolved of
any wrongdoing," he said.

   NEW YORK -- The dollar fell broadly against major
currencies, reaching a record low against the mark.
   The dollar's slide came amid signs that Mideast tensions
could be easing. That led traders to shift their attention
back to the weakening U.S. economy and to start selling
dollars.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Stock and bond prices edged higher. Bond prices, which
like stocks started the day heading lower, turned around
after it was reported that Jordan's King Hussein had been to
Iraq and was on his way to the U.S. to meet with President
Bush. That raised hopes that some sort of diplomatic
settlement might be in the works.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.99 to 2747.77, but
again volume was thin, as 130.3 million shares changed hands
in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   With the dollar less appealing as a haven, traders
concentrated on growing signs of economic weakness in the
U.S., including weaker than expected growth in July retail
sales. Traders think a continued economic slowdown will mean
lower U.S. interest rates, which reduce the dollar's appeal
to investors.
   "The currency market is reasserting the direction that was
in place" before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2, said
Jeffrey Mondschein, a managing director of Continental Bank.
   James Solloway, chief economist at Argus Research, said
that while stock-market investors may have been cheered by
the prospect of a cooling off in the Mideast, optimism about
a peaceful settlement may be unwarranted.
   Bond prices drew some strength from traders selling
short-term Treasuries to buy longer-term debt on the bet that
short-term prices will ease as new supply comes to auction in
the next few weeks.
   In major market action:

   Bond prices rose a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each
$1,000 of face amount, in light trading. The yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond eased to 8.77%.

   Thousands of small investors who bought stock on margin --
using money borrowed from their brokerage firms -- have had
to pony up additional collateral in recent days. Roiled by
soaring oil prices since the Kuwait invasion, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average this month has plunged about 157 points.
   Buying securities on margin is done only through brokerage
accounts. Technically, margin is the amount of cash put up
and amounts to at least 50% of a stock's purchase price. When
an investor's equity -- the current stock price minus the
loan amount -- drops to 25% to 30% of the stock price, he
will get a margin call requiring the deposit of more cash or
securities with the broker.
   "Whenever you get a drop in the stock market as steep as"
last week's, "you will get an increase in margin calls," says
Howard L. Clark Jr., chairman of American Express Co.'s
Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., one of the nation's
major brokerage firms. "However, I can say that we are
well-collateralized and we have minimal exposure as the
result of the increase."
   A surge in margin calls can be dangerous for Wall Street.
In rapid declines, investors can run out of money, causing
the brokerage firm to get stuck with losses of its own as it
sells the stocks of customers who can't meet calls. Some
brokerage firms, including Charles Schwab Corp., incurred
major losses after the 1987 crash when clients failed to meet
margin calls.
   But there don't seem to be any margin-call disasters this
time around, say executives at Shearson, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
and other major brokerage firms. Schwab, a San Francisco
discount broker, reports that this time there hasn't been
"anything not normal" on the margin front. Schwab say that's
partly due to its stricter margin requirements since the
crash, but also because cautious investors continue to keep
record levels of cash on hand.
   Another help, say the brokerage firms, is that the market
has had some modest rebounds in the days after its big
Mideast-related plunges. Most important, brokerage firms seem
to have stepped up efforts to monitor potential trouble in
clients' accounts after the difficulties of October 1987 and
1989.
   Unlike those two earlier times, margin calls now are
"almost a non-event," says James Cayne, president of the Bear
Stearns Cos. brokerage firm. "Maybe brokers were better as
far as being on top of it. Maybe brokers who had experienced
the `minicrash' saw what was happening" last week and headed
off problems, Mr. Cayne says.

   Mogul's New Book Is to Hit
   The Stores This Week
   With Publicity Aplenty

   NEW YORK -- If you don't want to see a lot of Donald Trump
in the next several weeks, you better stay away from
bookstores and keep your television set off. Trump, the
making of the next best seller, is under way.
   "Trump: Surviving at the Top" lands in 6,000 bookstores
nationwide this week, along with life-sized cardboard figures
of the real estate mogul. A sequel to "The Art of the Deal,"
the book will be heavily promoted by publisher Random House,
a unit of the Newhouse family's Advance Publications Inc.,
and Mr. Trump himself.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Friday night, Mr. Trump will appear on "20/20" with
Barbara Walters. Monday, he'll spend several hours
autographing copies of his book at a Waldenbooks store on
Wall Street. A two-part interview will run on NBC's "Today"
show next week, and he'll be interviewed by either Oprah
Winfrey or Phil Donahue.
   Regardless of how the book is reviewed, Random House's
aggressive handling is aimed at assuring that it will be a
big seller, though whether it recoups a seven-figure
guaranteed advance remains to be seen. The book was
originally set to be published in October, but Random House
decided to rush the book out sooner, partly to take advantage
of the publicity barrage over Mr. Trump's marital and
financial travails. Random House published a whopping first
printing of 500,000 copies, and more than 450,000 have
already been ordered by bookstores. "The Art of the Deal"
sold about 900,000 copies in hardcover.
   In addition, Random House has zealously guarded the new
book's contents, keeping it locked in a warehouse and
skipping the usual practice of selling excerpts to magazines.
Even review copies weren't sent out to the press, so when the
book hits the stores, consumers won't be swayed by critics'
opinions.
   Considering the lack of juicy details about both his
private life and his finances, "Surviving" may prove
disappointing to all but hard-core fans of Mr. Trump. "We
never suggested there was a deep, dark secret in this book,"
says a Random House publicist. "What's new about the book is
Donald's tone. It isn't as brassy as the first book, but it
is very blunt."
   Blunt he may be, but Mr. Trump (with co-writer Charles
Leerhsen of Newsweek) isn't very revealing about himself, nor
does he seem terribly humbled by the vicissitudes of his
life. Though Mr. Trump admits he may have overpaid for some
properties in the '80s, he is still boastful that he'll make
a mint from them and be proved a genius in the end. If he did
overpay, he says, it's just because "I get bored too easily.
. . . The same assets that excite me in the chase often, once
they are acquired, leave me bored. . . ."
   When it comes to his big deals, Mr. Trump tells how he
negotiated to buy the Trump Shuttle and the Plaza hotel, but
doesn't mention any losses. No details are included of the
delicate negotiations with his creditors that nearly led to
the dismemberment of Mr. Trump's empire and continue to leave
him loaded with debt. When Mr. Trump does flesh out details
from his work day, they are more likely to be about a request
to pose nude for Cosmopolitan magazine (he declined), or a
complaint from Trump Tower tenant Larry Hagman about the
tiles in his apartment bathroom.
   Even when it comes to trashing his enemies, Mr. Trump is
mild-mannered, taking on only vanquished villains such as
Leona Helmsley or deceased ones such as Malcolm Forbes.
(Journalists are another favorite target, including Wayne
Barrett, who is working on an unauthorized biography of Mr.
Trump.)
   Finally, anybody looking for the nitty-gritty on Mr.
Trump's romantic attachments better stick with the tabloids.
Mr. Trump seems to have split with his wife, Ivana, mostly
because he'd rather stay home watching television than attend
charity parties. ("I'm a man of very simple tastes," he
writes.) And there is only a single mention in the book of
model Marla Maples. Without revealing the nature of his
relationship with Ms. Maples, Mr. Trump writes, "Yet if I'd
never met her, Ivana and I would still be separated."

   WALNUT CREEK, Calif. -- Mission Resource Partners L.P.
said it plans to omit its second-quarter dividend as
second-quarter net fell 58% to $697,285, or 16 cents a share,
from a year earlier. Revenue fell 28% to $3.8 million.
   A year earlier, the company posted profit of $1.7 million,
or 38 cents a share, on revenue of $5.3 milllion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the six months, profit fell to $1.5 million, or 35
cents a share, from $2 million, or 47 cents a share. Revenue
declined to $77.7 million from $8.6 million.
   The partnership, which has interests in oil and gas wells,
blamed the decline on "a significant drop in oil and gas
prices" earlier this year, as well as absence of revenue from
oil and gas properties sold during its earlier restructuring.

   Weakening the Treasury

   The Mexican zeros are not some surplus aircraft purchased
from Japan, but bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. They were
also the subject of a heated exchange yesterday between Henry
Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, and David
Mulford, undersecretary of the Treasury.
   The incident adds to the impression that all is not well
at the United States Treasury. On a macro level, the economy
is slipping and the administration's economic strategy is
going nowhere. On a financial level, the Savings and Loan
bailout has not contained the economic impact, but has
succeeded in sticking the administration with political blame
that ought to rest with Congress. And on a micro level, the
Mexican zero controversy is threatening to permanently weaken
the Treasury as an institution.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The zeros are bonds that bear no interest but are sold at
a deep discount from face value. In the Mexican debt
agreement, they were very useful in allowing Mexico to buy
out the principal of loans with one up-front payment. But
there was an issue about the price, which according to a
General Accounting Office study turned out to be $192 million
less than nearly identical instruments were worth on the open
markets. Undersecretary Mulford keeps insisting that selling
the bonds to Mexico for below-market prices was not a
"subsidy." Chairman Gonzalez doesn't follow Mr. Mulford's
logic.
   We were among the first to write about the zeros, and have
spent some time with the issue. Our first suspicion was that
Mr. Mulford cobbled together a zero subsidy to make up for
the shortfall in "new money" under the Brady plan. Based on
further investigations, we no longer believe this to be the
case. The best face that can be put on the Treasury position
is that while the effect of the pricing was obviously a
subsidy, that was not the intention.
   Instead -- in our best judgment -- what happened was this:
The Mexicans had received one issue of zeros before a market
had ever developed in strips, the similar instruments
packaged and sold in private markets. In negotiating the next
deal, both the Treasury and the Mexicans assumed the new
zeros would be priced the same as the old ones. During the
negotiations, the strips market developed, giving a different
reading of the worth of the zeros.
   The Treasury didn't have the financial acumen to recognize
what was going on until after the essential bargain was
reached with the Mexicans. When the subsidy was then pointed
out, it didn't feel it could welsh on the Mexicans.
Especially so since the Bush Treasury had already in effect
welshed on a Mexican bridge loan negotiated under the Reagan
administration. Rather than confess this ineptitude, the
Treasury clings to the position that there was no subsidy.
   The GAO report concluded the Treasury had the legal
authority for this sale, but Mr. Gonzalez is worried about a
Treasury power to sell assets for less than the market says
they're worth. Now he wants the GAO to audit such previously
discretionary Treasury accounts as the Exchange Stabilization
Fund, chartering a creature of Congress to second-guessing
foreign exchange transactions. Because of the bungled zeros,
and particularly because of the effort to sell an untenable
story, formerly solid institutional powers may be drained
from Alexander Hamilton's Treasury.

   The over-the-counter market drifted higher on a rally in
telecommunications stocks in a session otherwise stalled by
fear.
   Many investors remain afraid of taking a position in the
market with the Middle East crisis unresolved.

<TEXT>
   "People are scared," says Robert McCready, institutional
trader at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons. "Nobody wants to be long or
short."
   Traders were unimpressed by the buying that focused on
cellular telephone stocks, calling it a "technical bounce"
after days of selling in the group.
   "There's no news to drive them," says Robert Antolini,
head of OTC trading at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. He adds
that many of the stocks "haven't had an uptick in days."
   Gains in stocks such as LIN Broadcasting, McCaw
Communications and Vanguard Cellular Class A drove the Nasdaq
Utility Index up 11.74, or 2.1%, to 568.88.
   Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index added 2.03, or about
0.5%, to 410.33. On the New York Stock Exchange, the
composite index rose 0.25%.
   OTC advancers led decliners, 1,114 to 809.
   Mr. Antolini says the lack of sellers in the OTC market
may mean there is an underlying desire to buy stocks.
   Volume totaled a dismal 107.5 million shares, but was well
ahead of Monday's 87.6 million shares when power outages in
New York City closed some of the biggest OTC trading desks.
   LIN Broadcasting rose 3 to 62 3/4, McCaw Communications
added 1 1/4 to 22 1/2, and Vanguard Cellular Class A gained 1
3/8 to 23. Vanguard reported yesterday that its loss for the
latest second quarter narrowed to 47 cents a share from 58
cents a year ago.
   MCI Communications and Telecom USA completed their merger,
under which MCI acquires Telecom USA's common stock for about
$1.25 billion. MCI added 3/4 to 37 yesterday.
   Intel led the most active list, dropping 1 1/4 to 36 1/4
on volume of more than 3 million shares. Bear Stearns
downgraded its rating on the stock to "hold" from "buy" and
removed the stock from its recommended list. The actions were
caused by continuing concern that Advanced Micro Devices may
emerge from a copyright suit with rights to "clone" Intel's
popular 80386 microprocessor. But not all of Wall Street
agrees that the case could hurt Intel. Last Thursday, Merrill
Lynch reiterated its positive rating on the stock. Bear
Stearns didn't change its earnings estimates for the company.
   Genzyme added 1 1/4 to 19 1/4 on heavy volume. Genzyme and
newly formed Neozyme, filed a combined registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the public
offering of 2.5 million units each consisting of 1 Neozyme
share and one warrant to buy one share of Genzyme stock.
Neozyme will receive all of the proceeds from the offering,
but these funds will be used to engage Genzyme to perform
research and development and clinical testing of a selected
group of health care products.
   Chiron rose 1 1/4 to 39 1/2 on nearly double its average
daily volume. Chiron reported profit of 20 cents a share in
the latest second quarter, up sharply from the year-ago
quarter when the company reported a loss of 30 cents a share.
Revenue in the latest second quarter nearly doubled to 17.8
million from 19.2 million a year earlier.
   Caere continued to climb as the market responds positively
to the company's hand-held scanner that enters text directly
from the printed page into a computer. Caere introduced its
"Typist" scanner for use with Apple Computer's Macintosh at
last week's MacWorld Conference in Boston. Caere added 2 1/4
to 23 3/4, after rising 1 1/4 Monday.
   Sundowner Offshore Services lost 1 5/8 to 11 3/8. The
company said it expects its third quarter profit to fall
below the profit reported for the first and second quarters
this year. The company also reported second quarter profit
today of $436,781, down from $527,826 a year ago. The company
attributed the decreases to idle periods for its rigs.
Sundowner went public last month at $9 a share in an offering
managed by Alex. Brown &amp; Sons.
   Image Bank tumbled 3/4 to 4 1/4 after announcing that it
expects to report a loss for the third quarter ended June 30.
The company, which operates an extensive photograph library,
said it expects the loss for the quarter to total about
$584,000, including a write-off of about $700,000 from
currently non-utilized foreign tax credits. Revenue for the
third quarter is expected to have increased to $13.4 million
from $10 million.
   Westcott Communications dropped 3/8 to 7 1/4, after
falling 1 1/2 points Monday. Yesterday, Alex. Brown
downgraded its rating on Westcott and lowered its 1990
earnings estimates for the company. Wescott produces
specialized televison programming for automobile dealers and
police departments.
   Crest Industries, which lost 1/4 point Monday, fell
another 1 5/8 to 4 3/8 yesterday. The company reported that
its first quarter profit fell to $850,247 from $1,356,452 a
year earlier. Crest went public in July at $6.75 a share in
an offering managed by Raymond James &amp; Associates.
   Ashton-Tate gained 1/4 to 8 3/4 after it authorized the
buy-back of up to two million of its shares. The software
company has about 27 million shares outstanding.

   Lenox, Mass. -- Tanglewood's Festival of Contemporary
Music looked backward this year. It was the 50th anniversary
of the Tanglewood Music Center, the educational arm of the
Boston Symphony's summer activities, which puts on the
festival, so there was a legitimate occasion for going back
to the former future. It could have been a grim parade of
academic compositions, but Oliver Knussen kept that from
happening. This genial, oversized, British composer-conductor
is Tanglewood's contemporary music coordinator, and, thank
heavens, he has a sense of humor. But what else would one
expect from the man who has written a jolly opera based on
Maurice Sendak's children's book, "Where the Wild Things
Are"?
   In theory, the festival, which is one of the few
mainstream showcases for new music, is a good idea to begin
with, and a very convenient and sensible way for the Boston
Symphony to fulfill its "obligation" to play contemporary
music. There's no need to pay expensive musicians for extra
rehearsal time -- that's what the students are there to do,
and it's part of their education, so the festival budget is a
mere $59,000 for six days of concerts (contrast this with a
reported $200,000 spent by the New York Philharmonic in July
for one underpublicized, ill-attended new-music concert at
City College).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The retrospective went all the way back to Tanglewood's
beginnings. Serge Koussevitzky, who founded it, championed
composers and made composition part of the educational summer
mix from the beginning. And on Saturday night, the Boston
Symphony's contribution to the festival was a work by one of
Koussevitzky's most famous proteges, William Schuman.
Schuman's Symphony No. 3 is almost as old as the Tanglewood
Music Center, and the concert fell on the composer's 80th
birthday. The symphony sounded fresh, vital and young, and it
got a knockout performance under Dennis Russell Davies.
   Mr. Knussen had to step carefully with the programming for
his student concerts. This is his fifth year at Tanglewood,
and his goal has been openness to various compositional
styles, in contrast to composerconductor Gunther Schuller,
who ran TMC from 1970 to 1984, and resigned after being
criticized for narrowly severe modernist programming.
   Still, Mr. Knussen gave a liberal airing to such Schuller
favorites as Jacob Druckman, Donald Martino, George Perle and
Mr. Schuller himself. But he also welcomed some of the more
tonally oriented folks who might have been considered
oddities when they were previously at Tanglewood -- the
British composer Judith Weir, or John Harbison, who has
turned away from serialism since he was a student here in
1959.
   Then there was the under-40 group, the people whose music
Mr. Knussen most wants to promote, and a few wild-card pieces
by composers who had nothing to do with Tanglewood at all,
such as Robin Holloway's "Souvenirs de Monsalvat," a
half-hour piano -- four hands orgy on themes from "Parsifal,"
with supertitles, and "Piece in Two Parts for Six Players" by
Stefan Wolpe, a favorite of faculty member Peter Serkin.
   Mr. Knussen's sense of humor came in handy, because the
hard-core academic pieces were a pretty depressing lot. Mr.
Druckman's String Quartet No. 3 was an interminable 28
minutes of squeaky fragments and dull noodling, but it was on
a program with George Crumb's luminous "An Idyll for the
Misbegotten," and Lukas Foss's amusing "Solo Observed," in
which an orchestra spends most of the piece watching the
pianist play a jazzy solo.
   Sunday evening's program was hardest to take, with George
Perle's impenetrable "Windows of Order" (String Quartet No.
8) and Marc Neikrug's banal "Chetro Ketl." Mr. Schuller's
"Chamber Symphony" was well-made but constipated, and the
Wolpe was a challenging kaleidoscope of souped-up Webern.
   But Mr. Knussen showed his true colors in the Sunday
morning program. Donald Martino's "From the Other Side," a
feeble attempt at wit, found itself on a program with other
works that played around with themes and ideas from other
composers: John Harbison's endearing "November 19, 1828," a
Schubert's-eye view of modern music; Judith Weir's "Airs From
Another Planet," with its transfigured Scottish tunes; and
"Souvenirs de Monsalvat." With such company, the final
movement of the Martino piece, "Das magische Kabarett des
Doktor Schoenberg," in which the father of serialism writes
dance music, seemed less silly.
   On balance, the balancing act went a bit too far. After a
few concerts, I started to wonder if all contemporary music
had to be either deadly serious or a jokey satire. Was there
nothing in between?
   Fortunately, we heard Luciano Berio's "Requies," a
shimmering, mournful elegy for his wife, the singer Cathy
Berberian; and Hans Werner Henze's masterful fragment,
"Introitus: Requiem," the beginning of a work in progress for
large ensemble. Mr. Knussen conducted and Mr. Serkin was the
soloist in the arresting, dramatically tense and spare piece.
John Harbison's "Words From Paterson," performed by the
Boston Symphony Chamber Players and baritone Sanford Sylvan
was, alas, a monochromatic disappointment.
   Mr. Knussen was supposed to leave after five years, but
Tanglewood has asked him to stay on to provide continuity in
a time of transition. So his vision will shape the festival's
near future, and both his openmindedness (he believes that
the rifts among compositional schools are starting to close)
and the dynamism and diversity of his younger composers are
most encouraging. Detlev Glanert's "Mahler-skizze," for
example, showed some of the control of forces that made the
Henze piece so impressive, and an almost Japanese economy of
means. Jorge Liderman's "A Cinque" was lyrical, with lovely
writing for winds, and Michael Daugherty's "Snap" sounded
like a big band gone off the deep end. There was even a token
minimalist on hand to break the tacit Tanglewood ban on such
things -- Marti Epstein with her pointillistic "Grand
Island." Especially impressive was Randall Woolf's "White
Heat" for full orchestra, this season's TMC commission. As
heard in rehearsal under Mr. Knussen, it was a whirl of
energy.

   Extra oil from two major producers that the U.S. was
counting on to help shelter world petroleum markets from a
supply crunch has failed to materialize as anticipated.
   In a surprising turn, Venezuela backed off from earlier
indications to Vice President Dan Quayle that it would
increase exports by several hundred thousand barrels a day.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia, also expected to help offset the loss of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude caused by the Mideast crisis, still
hasn't increased output by any substantial amount. The
kingdom remains committed to such a step and is studying it,
Saudi officials said yesterday.
   The reluctance of the two countries to export more oil
right now reflects their fear that doing so might permanently
undermine the integrity of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, already weakened by the hostilities
between Iraq and Kuwait. These four countries, plus Iran, are
OPEC's founders. In fact, yesterday Iran sharply criticized
the notion of any unilateral production increases.
   In Caracas, Venezuelan government officials said output
would be kept within Venezuela's OPEC quota of 1.9 million
barrels a day unless the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed to a new "concerted and coordinated effort"
to increase oil supplies.
   President Bush indicated at a news conference late
yesterday that he still expects an increase after talking by
phone with Venezuela's president. "I called him to thank him
for what I understood was a Venezuelan willingness to step up
and increase production -- they can still do it at a
reasonably efficient rate, I'm told -- and to thank him for
his approach on this," Mr. Bush said. "He told me that he'd
sent his foreign minister to various capitals to coordinate
all of this."
   The Venezuelan retrenchment shocked U.S. oil industry
officials -- as well as officials of Venezuela's national oil
company. Officials of Petroleos de Venezuela confirmed that
they had already increased oil production by between 100,000
and 200,000 barrels a day in the last few days on the
understanding they could sell more than the OPEC quota. The
oil, however, was stored and not shipped.
   "Venezuela has gone back on its commitment to increase
production," said Lawrence Goldstein, the executive vice
president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "And
this pushes up the time frame when the U.S. has to come to a
decision on its {strategic} petroleum reserve."
   His comments echo those of oil industry officials,
including the chairman of the American Petroleum Institute,
who are pushing the U.S. government to begin drawing supplies
quickly from the strategic reserve. They insist that this is
necessary to help offset the recent disappearance from the
market of some four million barrels a day of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti crude.
   The oil companies are concerned about the supply
situation, the price runups that can occur on hints of
shortages and the possible blame that falls on them as prices
rise.
   The reserve currently holds just under 600 million
barrels, but the Bush administration has indicated it doesn't
think releasing its oil into the marketplace is warranted
yet.
   Many oil companies expected substantial additional
supplies of oil from both Venezuela and Saudi Arabia to be on
the way by now. The companies had requested extra barrels
from those producers just in recent days after President Bush
had said both promised increases in output.
   Yesterday, the oil companies still were waiting for word
they would get the oil. "Communications have taken place with
Saudi Arabia and with Petroleos de Venezuela relative to
increased supplies, but there has been no confirmation," said
an official of a major oil company that previously had been
buying oil from Iraq.
   It is understood that Saudi officials this week are
considering the "nominations" for more petroleum -- as such
purchaser requests are known -- including one from Kuwait
Petroleum Co., the Kuwaiti national oil company that is
continuing to operate in exile from Britain. It previously
supplied its European refining and marketing network from its
own nation's oil output.
   Saudi Arabia is moving cautiously, oil experts say,
because it must consider the politics of its region as well
as pure petroleum economics. The Saudis want a stable oil
market, however, and once they take action, it is assumed
they could replace as much as half -- or two million barrels
a day -- of the lost Iraqi-Kuwaiti oil.
   Although Venezuela doesn't have as much spare capacity,
extra output by it could make an especially big difference to
U.S. oil supplies. For the U.S., Venezuelan oil is known as a
"short-haul" crude, only six days away by tanker from its
main customers, American oil companies. Transport time for a
tanker from the Mideast is about 30 days.
   Complicating the picture in Venezuela apparently is an
oil-policy disagreement within the government. On one side is
the national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, which is
willing, even eager, to produce as much as it can sell and
has even suggested Venezuela pull out of OPEC. On the other
is the government oil ministry, which wants Venezuela to
maintain good relations with others in the organization it
helped found.
   So far OPEC politics is the overriding factor. "We are
willing to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day, if
it's a concerted effort in OPEC, but we would like to have a
consensus first," a petroleum ministry official said in
Caracas.
   Another government official said that the president of
Venezuela had been willing to increase production in the
immediate aftermath of the Iraqi invasion but that "the
reaction was so strong from the other ministers {in OPEC}
that the order was rescinded."
   This official said Venezuela's oil minister now is
requesting an emergency session of OPEC to consider a
coordinated effort. "Venezuela, which does not wish to raise
production unilaterally, has joined Saudi Arabia in asking
for a meeting as soon as possible," he said.
   The Saudis and the Venezuelans haven't gotten much support
yet in their call for a meeting. Few OPEC oil ministers want
to renew the kind of wrenching debate they had in late July
when President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was threatening Kuwait
while demanding a $7-a-barrel increase in OPEC's "reference,"
or target, price.
   This time, many ministers worry, OPEC would be even more
seriously split between those backing Iraq, which strongly
objects to any changes in the July agreement, and those
supporting Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. The debate over who
would represent Kuwait would also be bitter.
   Iraq renewed its warnings yesterday against any OPEC
nations planning to increase output to replace its blocked
supplies. At a Caracas news conference, the Iraqi ambassador
to Venezuela said "those who take action against us will
suffer damage." He did not say what sort of retaliation Iraq
had in mind.
   Some people within OPEC expressed hope that any meeting
might be unnecessary within a few days. They weren't
specific, but yesterday it was announced that Jordan's King
Hussein, who has been trying to act as an intermediary in the
crisis, will meet with President Bush carrying a message from
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Many OPEC ministers also endorse the view of Sadek
Boussena, OPEC president and Algeria's oil minister, that
world oil supplies remain ample. The oil glut so widely
publicized until the Aug. 2 invasion hasn't gone away, they
noted.
   "Big oil companies in the world intend to harm OPEC by
taking advantage of the current situation," Iran's President
Ali Akbar Rafsanjani said, according to the official Iranian
news agency. "OPEC members equally have no right to commit
treachery against their people in favor of the global oil
devourers," Mr. Rafsanjani added. He was speaking after
receiving Venezuela's foreign minister, who delivered a
message from the Venezuelan president, Carlos Andres Perez.
   Still, several OPEC countries capable of increasing
production are doing so. These are Nigeria, Indonesia and
Libya -- and Iran.
   Monitors of OPEC production, including Cristina Haus of
Energy Security Analysis Inc. and the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation's Mr. Goldstein, place Iran's output at
around 3.2 million barrels a day, slightly above its OPEC
quota of 3.1 million. In addition, Iran has been speedily
unloading unsold oil it had sitting in Europe before the
Iraq-Kuwait crisis broke out.
   According to London-based traders, Iran had eight very
large crude carriers parked offshore Northwest Europe -- each
holding about 1.6 million barrels of crude -- and an
equivalent amount stored onshore until the crisis. All that
has been sold within the past few days, at the sharply higher
prices in effect this month.
   Nonetheless, said Mr. Goldstein, world oil supplies are
taking a fresh jolt from the latest developments. "We have
now lost the equivalent of 90 million barrels in the matter
of August oil supplies that we thought would be available,"
he said.

   Why are we in Saudi Arabia? We're there to protect the
integrity of the world's oil supply. On that point, there is
universal agreement. The world cannot tolerate a power with
the capability of imposing a tax on all the West, especially
a power that would use its profits to build nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons to extract more declarations of
surrender and tribute.
   By now it should be obvious, though, that something more
significant is at stake in this large and increasingly
multinational military intervention. For all the
second-guessing now starting, the world community is sending
an overdue message that it will not tolerate piracy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein is indeed a modern pirate, whose men this
week were literally looting Kuwait of its material wealth and
carting it back to Baghdad. With the world now being made
small by the wonders of electronic miniaturization and
instant communication, it has grown extraordinarily
vulnerable to this kind of threat. If in the next century the
world is to realize the promise of the interdependencies it
has begun to create, it will have to learn to suppress
piracy.
   Financial transactions for quite some time now have been
carried on electronically across borders, pulling together
the world's economic players. But it was really only with the
astonishing televised events from China's Tiananmen Square,
followed by the fall of the Berlin Wall and communism in
Eastern Europe, that the world's people began to see that
they were no longer operating as political and economic
islands. Politics, currencies, trade, and yes, basic
political values are all being drawn together into an
evolving consensus of what constitutes a world order.
   The Saddam Husseins of the world would wreck this. Their
piracy would constantly shatter and retard the aspirations of
workers at all levels of the world's economic system.
Briefing NATO's foreign ministers last week, Secretary of
State Baker suggested that "the world could be plunged into a
new dark age" if the Iraqis got away with stealing Kuwait. An
overstatement? Not really.
   Saddam's seizure of Kuwait is only the largest
manifestation of a form of nihilistic politics whose modern
roots began with the terrorist movements of the 1970s. Often
abetted by Communist governments that now lie discredited,
these movements wrapped themselves in a camouflage of
ideological grievances against the West and in various
irridentist territorial claims. Then they started shooting.
And bombing and kidnapping and blowing up the innocent. This
lawlessness boiled itself down into the Iraqi theft of Kuwait
and the threat to Saudi Arabia and the world oil pipelines.
At this point, President Bush organized an international
resistance.
   The U.S. has been here before in its history. Saddam
Hussein is little different from the Bey of Algiers or Pasha
of Tripoli in their confrontation with Thomas Jefferson.
President Jefferson found he needed a military response to
the Barbary Pirates, and sent the Navy on a long, slow voyage
to the far-off Mediterranean. A similar feel for the higher
stakes was contained in Mr. Bush's words a fortnight ago:
"This will not stand."
   Viewing the events of the past two weeks, it should be
possible to draw some conclusions about the suppression of
piracy. It requires a leader; if the United States, in the
world leadership role it has held for 40 years, hadn't
stepped forward, Saddam Hussein would be in Riyadh.
   Effective leadership, too, requires action. Consensus
follows. Naturally, a leader musters what support he can --
European allies, the Turks, various frightened Arabs, a U.N.
resolution. But there is no time to wait for ditherers abroad
or at home. What the world wants to know is whether the U.S.
will be there to follow, and this is proved by getting on
with the task.
   There will of course be doubters. Senator Sam Nunn's early
doubts about a long-term Gulf presence cannot have helped
bring wavering allies aboard. Jordan's King Hussein, who
visits President Bush tomorrow, should be told bluntly that
we will not tolerate Iraqi troops on his territory, with or
without his invitation. Anyone who mentions Vietnam should be
reminded that Iraq has no superpower protector or supplier.
   Some of the same people who said the U.S. had no national
interests in Vietnam, indeed, are now saying it is
confronting Iraq only out of materialism. With harder days in
the Gulf likely to come, the President and his men should not
be embarrassed to assert that this effort unites the
materialistic goal of oil and the idealistic goal of world
order. And they should be clear about their purpose: The goal
of deterring piracy requires that Saddam be taught a lesson.
   The ultimate objective ought to be the overthrow of the
Saddam government; peace in the Gulf requires that the Iraqi
military be cut back to reasonable size and its oil reserves
put into the hands of a more reasonable custodian. Judging by
the forces being deployed, the option of an assault on
Baghdad is being prepared, but at the moment our stated aim
is forcing Saddam to withdraw his forces from Kuwait. This
would still require something to make sure that he doesn't
simply rerun the same strategy at some future date. Under
those circumstances, we presume, the Emir of Kuwait would no
longer reject a sustained U.S. military presence in his
kingdom.
   The current Gulf intervention is grounded in the
clear-eyed premise that the world remains a dangerous place
for civilized values. After much well-earned celebration over
freedom rising from the ruins of communism behind the Iron
Curtain, Saddam Hussein's iron aggression is driving home the
necessary lesson that the new, evolving world is susceptible
to aggression. To secure its future, the civilized world must
now defeat the politics of piracy that Saddam Hussein so
clearly represents.

   Recession? Maybe. "Stagflation?" No.
   The American economy has withstood the first shock of the
Middle Eastern crisis without much inflation, and it may
continue to do so for quite a while. A critical ingredient --
inflationary psychology -- is missing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With the important and visible exception of oil and oil
products, prices in general have failed to rise since Iraq's
Saddam Hussein stormed Kuwait 13 days ago, plunging the world
into its first grave crisis since the end of the Cold War.
   Many people say the increased costs of oil and
petrochemical products will force up prices on a wide range
of other consumer and industrial goods, but later -- perhaps
three to six months later -- not now. Oil is crucial to
industrial economies. Certainly if the crisis continues, the
prices of practically everything from avocados to Ziploc bags
will reflect the already higher costs of gasoline, heating
oil, fuel oil and petrochemicals.
   "There will be some resistance to price hikes," says Nobel
Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson, "but I wouldn't
expect it to be strong enough to prevent the rise from
happening."
   Still, passing along cost increases -- and even that may
be tough to do in many cases -- hardly amounts to runaway
inflation. Among scores of business people and others
interviewed by The Wall Street Journal in a dozen cities over
the past few days, there was no indication that the
self-fulfilling prophecies of inflationary psychology are
taking hold. The classic symptoms are notable only by their
absence: plans for pre-emptive price increases in
anticipation of cost increases, for example, or speculative
inventory ordering in hope of reaping windfall inflationary
profits in the future.
   In fact, many business people think it will be difficult
enough simply to pass on their cost increases to customers.
Many are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward pricing. They
wait because they see no point in antagonizing customers with
price increases that will be hard to maintain, and
practically impossible to maintain if the Iraqi crisis
dissipates quickly.
   This time, unlike the energy crunches and inflationary
manias of the 1970s and early 1980s, the economy appears to
remain in a fundamentally non-inflationary mode. While
inventories in many industries are tight, the demand for
goods and services is weak.
   Earlier oil shocks struck the Western world in late 1973
and in 1979. And the U.S. experienced three years of
double-digit inflation as measured by the increase in the
Consumer Price Index: 12.3% in 1974, followed by 13.3% in
1979 and 12.5% in 1980.
   "I think it's different now," says economist Joel Polkin,
a close observer of prices. "The economy is much weaker, and
it is not going to be as easy to pass these things {cost
increases} through." Robert Aliber, an economist at the
University of Chicago, agrees. "The whole analysis which
compares the '70s and the '90s is purely on the supply side,"
he says. "What it neglects is that with the first two OPEC
{Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries} oil shocks,
the economy was running full steam."
   This time it isn't.
   The Southeast's textile industry is a case in point. It is
heavily dependent on synthetics made from petrochemicals, and
is quickly affected by cost increases experienced by its
suppliers. But, say officials of Guilford Mills Inc.,
Greensboro, N.C., suppliers haven't yet raised prices.
Because of weak consumer demand, "It hasn't been an
environment to raise prices," says Paul McGarr, senior vice
president for finance. "We've got a little breathing time
because our primary suppliers haven't made any move to pass
increases along to us."
   BASF Corp., in Parsippany, N.J., is a consumer of
petrochemical feedstocks that it uses to make fibers for
carpets and clothes, specialty chemicals for home decorating
products, and antifreeze. "We are presently negotiating with
our suppliers, who are requesting price increases," says
Helmuth von Moltke, a spokesman for the firm. But the company
says demand for many of its products has been slowing, and
may limit its ability to pass on cost increases.
   The demand for nylon in home carpeting is especially weak.
"It's tough to increase prices in a weak market," says Mr.
Moltke. "Eventually, nylon prices will have to go up because
our margins are being squeezed, but the timing is unclear."
   A variety of contractual arrangements protect some
businesses and their customers from the immediate effect of
fuel and feedstock increases. Monsanto Co.'s Monsanto
Chemical Co. subsidiary, for example, the second-largest
American nylon producer and the largest producer of acrylic
fibers, has contracts that guarantee stable feedstock costs
through the end of August.
   If oil prices stay at their current high levels, "there is
no doubt that consumers would see higher prices for apparel,
carpet and tires," says Earl Brasfield, group vice president
for fibers at Monsanto Chemical. But weak demand and
competitive pressures seem likely to delay oil-related
increases. Monsanto now believes that price increases in
consumer products, such as acrylic sweaters, would be small.
The company says it doesn't know when prices might actually
rise.
   Dow Chemical Co.'s DowBrands Inc., Indianapolis, says
consumers who use its plastic wraps, Ziploc bags and other
products may see no price increases for at least three to six
months because of sizable inventories and promotional deals
with distributors. Even then, says Richard Parry, a company
spokesman, increases would be so small -- a few cents a
package -- that consumers would "hardly notice."
   Sherwin-Williams Co., Cleveland, says it has already
encountered higher prices on the solvents it buys on the
spot, or noncontractual, market. But the chemical and
coatings manufacturer says the Iraq crisis will have to
persist for a long time before the company would pass price
increases on to its paint customers. This is partly because
it has adequate inventories and partly because much of its
raw material is purchased under contract at lower prices.
   In Pittsburgh, Consolidated Natural Gas Co. says long-term
contracts and the slowness with which natural-gas costs will
rise in response to oil-price increases have insulated the
company and its customers.
   "If fuel prices stay up, cosmetics prices will go up,"
says Richard Heath, chief executive officer of Beauticontrol
Cosmetics Inc., Dallas. He expects cosmetics price increases
of 2% to 3% -- but not right now. The plastic bottles used to
package cosmetics are made from petrochemicals and, he says,
"there are already rumblings about price increases in
packaging." But, he adds, "our inventories and contracts to
purchase are such that we probably have a six-to-seven-month
barrier against packaging price increases."
   "The economy is weak," says Ira Silver, chief economist
for J.C. Penney Co., Dallas. "So if we recover our higher
energy costs by raising the price of a sweater, our concern
is, nobody is going to buy it." Penney has already marked
prices down this year because of weak demand, and hopes to
avoid increases.
   Borden Inc., New York, the food and consumer-products
company, says it is waiting to see if the crisis persists and
its competitors act before it will consider raising prices,
although its transportation costs have already begun to
increase. "If oil prices keep going up, we'll have to raise
our prices," a spokesman says, but only as a last resort.
"It's a very competitive market place out there," he says.
   Gene Hardy, treasurer of La-Z-Boy Chair Co., Detroit, says
slower home sales and higher interest rates would make it
hard for the company to raise prices. Profit margins and
earnings have fallen, he says. "The furniture business has
been in a recessionary period for almost two years, and we
hit the most severe point in the last three months," he says.
When the company does get hit with energy cost increases, he
adds, it will have to raise prices, perhaps in the fall.
   Even if its own costs rise -- and they haven't yet --
Wendy's Inc., in Pittsburgh, says they're unlikely to be
passed on to customers. The burger business is engaged in a
discount war, Wendy's says.
   Some businessmen have contrived alternatives to price
increases. In Houston, Sysco Corp. says it tries to offset
higher fuel costs, and avoid higher prices, with cost-cutting
measures: for example, by reducing the frequency of
deliveries that its institutional food service trucks make,
and avoiding sending out half-full trucks. "We have no plans
to put (price increases) in," says E. James Lowrey, executive
vice president.
   Daigle Oil Co., in northern Maine's Aroostook County, is
taking a gamble, offering next winter's supply of home
heating oil to its customers at today's prices of only 99.9
cents a gallon -- for customers who will pay the estimated
bill up front. In areas like this, where the economy is weak,
such promotions are increasing the competitive pressures
against price increases. Conversion of home heating furnaces
from oil-fired to gas-fired, stimulated by last winter's
sharp increase in heating oil prices, has contributed to the
competitive pressure in New England.
   Atlas Van Lines, based in Evansville, Ind., a few days ago
filed a 2% rate-increase request with the Interstate Commerce
Commission to offset rising fuel prices, says David Steves,
agent for the firm's Boston affiliate. But the company
decided against a similar request for higher rates within the
state of Massachusetts because of the soft local economy.
"Business is way off in Massachusetts," he says.
   Elsewhere, too, many businessmen expect to absorb cost
increases. "We will absorb higher costs until we feel as if
the prices have stabilized," says Ed F. Kruse, chairman and
chief executive officer of Blue Bell Creameries Inc., in
Brenham, Texas. The company is a large regional supplier of
ice cream and frozen desserts. "Some people, including
myself, tend to think that this crisis might be resolved a
littler sooner" than the 1973-74 oil crisis, Mr. Kruse says.
"We're not going to panic."
   Some trucking firms in the Midwest are refraining from
passing on their cost increases on gasoline and diesel fuel.
Jake's Egg &amp; Distributing Co., in Houston, is doing the same,
says Sam Sakowitz, a vice president. "The way our pricing and
customers are," he says, "the increase in diesel fuel is a
cost that we absorb, and when it goes down, we'll absorb
that, too." He adds, "We wouldn't do any business" if Jake's
raised its charges and competitors didn't.
   But Greyhound Lines Inc., Dallas, raised fares by 2%
Monday to compensate for higher fuel costs.
   Eastern Airlines, along with the rest of the airline
industry, is raising fares to offset higher jet-fuel costs.
But then it will turn around and reduce fares in a
limited-period fall promotion. Air traffic usually falls off
after Labor Day.
   Bush administration economists estimate that a 50% rise in
the price of oil would promote a two-step increase in prices:
Higher gasoline and heating oil prices would add 1 percentage
point to the consumer price index. Indirect effects, as the
oil increases filtered through the economy to hamburger
containers and polyester slacks, would add another percentage
point.
   But those estimates are drawn from the experience of the
inflationary 1970s. With the economy already on the verge of
recession, economists say, businesses will probably find it
harder to pass on cost increases.
   Lyle Gramley, a former governor of the Federal Reserve
Board, is one of those who observe that the country's current
economic predicament differs greatly from the 1970. "It's a
much less inflationary environment," he says. "People in
those days just gulped and passed on every price increase."

   $35.6 Million Loss

   Eastern Airlines reported a second-quarter loss of $35.6
million, a deficit that would have been four times as deep
without asset sales.
   In addition, the Miami-based carrier, still operating
under Bankruptcy Court protection, said it expects to have
losses for the rest of the year as fuel prices continue to
rise and it struggles to rebuild its operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Eastern said it had gains of $114.8 million in the latest
quarter from asset sales. A year earlier, it had a $129.3
million loss after gains of $261.8 million. Revenue for the
quarter was $545.2 million, up substantially from last year's
$89.6 million, when Eastern was practically shut down by a
strike.
   Despite the narrower loss and the revenue gain, other
signposts don't bode well for Eastern. The airline filled
61.5% of its seats in the first six months, far below its
break-even point. And that traffic came from highly seasonal,
heavily discounted tickets.
   A bankruptcy judge in April wrested control of the airline
from its parent, Continental Airline Holdings Inc. (formerly
Texas Air Corp.), and the airline said bookings fell for
April and May as a result of the bad publicity.
   For the six months, the airline had a net loss of $172
million on revenue of $1.1 billion. For the 1989 first half,
the net loss was $384.5 million on revenue of $710.2 million.
   Meanwhile, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York granted
Eastern temporary relief from major provisions in its labor
contract with pilots.
   "It is clear that prompt cost reductions, including pilot
labor cost reductions, are essential if an imminent
liquidation of the estate is to be avoided," Judge Burton
Lifland said in his ruling.
   The pilots' union issued a statement saying it was
disappointed but not surprised by the court action. "We'll
consider whether to appeal," Richard Seltzer, an attorney for
the Air Line Pilots Association, said. "We think this
decision was without a basis in fact and in law."

Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its ratings on the
company's senior debt to Baa-2 from Baa-1, and on
subordinated debt to Baa-3 from Baa-2. The Prime-2 rating on
commercial paper was confirmed. Moody's said its action is
based "on the expectation for lower operating margins because
of the constraints in defense spending expected during the

   Tokyo stock prices finished higher Tuesday, a day after
the market had one of its biggest setbacks since the
beginning of this year. Shares extended late-morning gains
during the afternoon on widespread perception that both
stocks and futures were oversold.
   London shares closed higher on bargain-hunting in issues
thought to be oversold.

   In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up
496.10 points at 26672.53. The index plunged 1153.12 points,
or 4.22%, Monday.
   At midmorning Wednesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index was up
911.19 points to 27583.72.
   Tuesday's volume on the First Section was 380 million
shares, up from Monday's 267.5 million.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues 584 to 337,
while 130 remained unchanged.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the First Section, which plunged 63.84 points Monday, was
up 27.29 points, or 1.37%, at 2020.33.
   The Second Section index, which plummeted 123.75 points
Monday, was up 7.00 points, or 0.18%, to close at 3995.36.
   Volume in the Second Section was estimated at nine million
shares, up from 7.2 million Monday.
   "If New York {stocks} had fallen yesterday {Monday}, Tokyo
wouldn't have ended this way," said Yoshihiro Ito, general
manager of stock trading at Okasan Securities. "This market
is moving according only to investor psychology at the
moment," he said.
   The market advanced strongly right after the open,
reflecting relief of many investors who had feared Monday's
plunge in Tokyo might prompt a sell-off on Wall Street,
traders said.
   The Nikkei index fell 600 points to 25949 points at
midmorning, however, under pressure of arbitrage selling as
futures indexes declined.
   Then, as the index fell below 26000 points,
bargain-hunting buy orders by dealers, some institutions and
corporations, targeted at oversold large-capital shares,
gradually pushed up stock prices.
   "There was frequent talk among brokerage houses and
investors in the afternoon that the market must have hit near
bottom," said a trader at Dai-Ichi Securities.
   In response to the recovery of the cash market,
institutions that had been selling futures for short hedges
bought back futures. Higher futures indexes in turn
encouraged further buying on the spot market, traders said.
   Observers saw Tuesday's gain as a technical rebound after
Monday's sharp plunge and predicted that a continual sharp
rebound is unlikely.
   "Stock prices fell with no specific reason yesterday. They
went up without any good news today," said Hiroyuki Murai,
general manager of stock trading at Nikko Securities.
   Kimitoshi Hasegawa, head of Separate Account Management at
Dai-Ichi Mutual Life, said, "The market absorbed the possible
impact of the Iraqi problem last week. Monday's loss should
be explained by the market's internal factors."
   Nippon Steel advanced 28 yen (19 cents) to 538 yen,
becoming the most heavily traded stock for the day. NKK was
up 25 to 528.
   Among shipbuilding companies, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
advanced 17 to 830, while IHI gained 18 to 830.
   Gold mining companies were bought on rising gold prices on
the world market as investors hedge inflationary risks caused
by the higher oil prices prompted by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   Sumitomo Metal Mining gained 60 to 1,600. Mitsubishi
Mining rose 29 to 670.
   London shares finished higher Tuesday. Internationals were
particularly cheered by the stronger pound, dealers said.
   But dealers said they were keeping a close eye on Wall
Street and even more so on unfolding developments in the
Middle East. Trading was described as sparse and lacking in
incentive.
   Stocks were also buoyed by earnings news from Hanson,
Britain's largest industrial conglomerate, which announced a
26% rise in pretax profit for its latest nine months, ended
June 30. The earnings arrived at the top end of market
expectations and were helped by first-time contributions from
the acquisition of Consolidated Gold Fields. Hanson gained
6.5 pence to 215.5 pence in heavy trading.
   At the closing bell, the broad-based Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was up 14.5 points at 2234.0. The
index reached its intraday high in the first hour of official
trading when it was up 22.6 at 2242.1, while hitting its
intraday minimum of 2224.0 at the start of trading.
   The narrower FT 30-share index finished up 10.4 points at
1742.6. Turnover amounted to a scant 330.9 million shares,
compared with 294.3 million Monday.
   In the futures market, the September FT-SE 100 index
contract finished the session at 2250.0, up from 2238.0
Monday.
   U.K. industrial production figures released yesterday had
little impact on a market in which many investors had closed
their positions to take summer holidays, dealers said.
   Among corporate features, Lonrho, with large gold mining
and refining interests, rose 6 to 268. The stock was buoyed
by a sharp move higher in the spot bullion price as investors
flee into the yellow metal on a perception as a "safe haven"
in times of international crisis. Gold was set at $411.50 an
ounce at the late London gold fixing Tuesday, up from $404.30
Monday.
   Among oils, British Petroleum rose 4.5 to 363.5, Shell
advanced 5 to 484 and Enterprise rose a penny to 670.
   Domestic issues were hampered by opinions that U.K.
interest rates would have to remain high for some time to
come because of the inflationary costs that higher oil prices
will bring to the U.K. economy.
   Dealers said Reuters rose after being sharply oversold in
recent weeks. The stock ended 18 higher at #10.04 ($18.90).
Anglo-Dutch food and household products group Unilever
advanced 10 to 664 on strong volume of 2.1 million shares.
   Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Frankfurt, Zurich
and Madrid, lower in Paris, Brussels and Milan, mixed in
Amsterdam and flat in Stockholm. South African gold stocks
closed higher.
   Prices closed higher in Sydney, Taipei, Hong Kong, Manila
and Singapore, and lower in Wellington and Seoul.

   Federal Prisoners Are Unfair Competition
   ----
   By Bingham Kennedy

   In Georgia, a decorated Marine Corps veteran was denied
contracts that would have put unemployed Vietnam vets to work
making mattresses for VA hospitals. In Wisconsin, a
struggling small business was gradually squeezed out of the
market for electrical parts for the Army's tanks, while in
Michigan another small firm in the same line of business
folded. In other cases, severely handicapped workers have
lost opportunities for work due to their workshop's loss of
government contract opportunities.
   The single cause of these and other hard luck stories is
not foreign competition or shrinking federal procurement
budgets, but a 56-year-old law creating a preference in
federal contracting for one organization: Federal Prison
Industries, Inc., the government-owned corporation that runs
workshops employing convicts in federal penitentiaries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Over the years, Congress has created many programs to help
particular segments of the economy: Small businesses, Indian
tribes, minority-owned firms, sheltered workshops for the
blind and severely handicapped and many others are all
favored in the doling out of federal contracts. But the
organization that has the highest priority -- a statutory
right of first refusal on any federal supply contract -- is
FPI.
   FPI was created as a government-owned corporation in 1934.
By 1984, its sales -- all of them to the federal government
-- had reached $210 million; only four years later they had
jumped to $336 million, employing 13,330 inmates. That level
of sales puts FPI among the top 100 federal contractors,
ahead of Chrysler, Mobil Oil, Eastman Kodak and many other
big companies. FPI's dramatic growth is expected to continue,
partly because the number of inmates is expected to increase
sharply in the next five years.
   FPI is theoretically required by statute to charge
"current market prices," but that restriction has little
practical meaning. In 1930, for example, the War Department
asked the General Accounting Office whether it could purchase
commercial brooms since the only item offered by the prison
industries was a brush, with no handle, for which the price
was 80% higher. The GAO ruled that the War Department had to
purchase prison-made brushes if the Army could modify them to
meet its needs, and that any dispute concerning prices should
be resolved by arbitration. More recently, federal
procurement regulations have been issued requiring that
permission for an agency to purchase from a commercial firm
normally will not be granted merely "because of a lower
price."
   As a result, although FPI grants many waivers, in some
cases its prices still exceed commercial prices by a wide
margin. For example, a contractor who provides draperies to
the Navy in Norfolk, Va., for $18 per pair is being forced
out by FPI, which offers the same item for $26.
   Although FPI's prices are unrestricted, it is spared many
expenses faced by the firms it pre-empts. It pays no taxes,
no rent for land and no commissions to salesmen, while its
wages to prisoners range from 15 cents to $1.10 per hour. In
response, FPI points out that it bears some costs not
incurred by commercial firms and faces many other
disadvantages. Nonetheless, with all its competitive
advantages, coupled with the absence of any competition, it
is surprising that FPI is not more profitable than it is.
   In 1988, on sales of $351 million it reported net income
slightly under $21 million from its operations. Part of the
explanation lies in the fact that FPI spent more than $25
million for "selling, general and administrative expenses."
But a more fundamental factor is that much of FPI's cash flow
goes for the cost of goods sold.
   Although Congress has restricted the prison industries to
production of labor intensive items to provide employment for
"the greatest number of . . . inmates . . . as is reasonably
possible," FPI uses its profits to acquire equipment to
reduce its need for inmate labor, while relying heavily on
suppliers. In 1988, FPI spent more than $262 million for
materials while employing only 30% of the inmate population.
Strangely, its annual report to Congress for that year
boasted of "increased factory efficiencies" that resulted in
a 12.4% decrease in employment.
   As these figures suggest, for some items such as systems
furniture, FPI does little more than assemble the products it
sells. Although such items provide relatively little work for
inmates, they enable FPI to insert itself between commercial
firms and the purchasing agency and to reap the high profits
associated with prime contracts, with little related risk.
   Similarly, FPI has ignored congressional direction not to
pursue service contracts. Although it is authorized to
perform only supply contracts, FPI performed printing and
other service contracts totaling $13.14 million in 1984. FPI
not only profits from printing contracts directly, it also is
currently using them as justification for entry into related
fields, such as envelope manufacturing.
   All this might be well and good if FPI were giving inmates
vocational training that would be useful upon release.
However, the available data raise serious questions on that
point. A recent survey conducted by a furniture industry
trade association indicated that very few released federal
convicts had found employment in that industry despite FPI's
extensive activity in the field. Curiously, FPI itself has no
figures concerning the employment of its alumni upon
graduation.
   Congress responded to some of these problems in 1988 with
reform legislation designed to prevent undue concentration by
FPI in any particular industry. Under the statute, FPI must
notify the public and private industry representatives if it
plans to sell a new product or significantly expand
production of an existing one. Although limited by the law to
a "reasonable market share," FPI itself is to define that
term and to decide whether an increase in production of an
item is "significant," requiring notification to the public.
   There may be good answers to all the questions being asked
about FPI by small businesses around the country. New reform
proposals have been offered, congressional hearings have
already been held and more are expected. But is the special
treatment of the Federal Prison Industries program worth
preserving at all?

   Study Warns a Recession
   Might Pressure Junk Bonds

   NEWS YORK -- "Good" junk bonds, despite a long period of
outperforming lower-rated junk, might get clobbered harder in
a recession, according to a new report from Salomon Brothers
Inc.
   In the report, Salomon analysts warned that the so-called
top tier of the high-yield junk bond market may face
"continued downward price pressure" from higher oil prices
and an impending recession. Of course, the word recession has
haunted the junk bond market for more than a year now,
causing prices of most middle- and lower-tier bonds to
experience sharp declines.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But according to Salomon's Joseph Bencivenga, director of
high-yield research, recession fears have eluded the top
tier. "They've almost acted too good," he said, and this
could soon change, if a recession in fact does materialize.
Salomon economists forecast that a recession is likely,
inflation could rise to 5% and oil could settle at $24 a
barrel. In the high-yield research department, Mr. Bencivenga
is taking an even more pessimistic view.
   In a worse case scenario, which assumes $30-a-barrel oil,
7% inflation and a recession, Mr. Bencivenga said that "the
greatest exposure to adverse price movement" exists in the
$40 billion of securities that make up the top tier of the
junk bond market. Most of those issues currently trade at 90%
of face value or higher. In the case of a recession, prices
of all junk bonds will deteriorate. But price of high-quality
junk will fall faster because it will come under more selling
pressure, as money managers are forced to sell their most

   WASHINGTON -- President Bush accused congressional
Democrats of reneging on a pledge to offer a
deficit-reduction plan and vowed to veto any spending bill
that "busts the budget."
   Mr. Bush, interrupting his Maine vacation for a day in
Washington, accused the Democratic-controlled Congress of "an
abdication of responsibility that endangers our economic
vitality and the jobs that go with it."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The president has been promising a public attack on the
Democrats for more than two weeks, and he began a late
afternoon news conference yesterday with a statement blaming
Democrats for the lack of progress in the budget talks.
   The talks, which began in mid-May and broke off at the end
of July, are to resume immediately after Labor Day at Andrews
Air Force Base just outside Washington, congressional aides
said.
   Without an agreement, about $84 billion in automatic
spending cuts will be triggered under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law, and Mr. Bush insisted yesterday that
"as painful as such deep cuts will be, I must uphold the law
. . . knowing that I've done all in my power to avoid them."
   Mr. Bush also strongly suggested he plans to veto any
appropriations bills that exceed his budget request. He
complained that the House already has passed 10
appropriations bills, eight of which exceeded his budget
request by $14 billion.
   He didn't mention, however, that Republicans voted for the
bills in large numbers, in many cases overwhelmingly.
Moreover, prominent Republicans -- including, on the Senate
side, Bob Dole of Kansas, the GOP leader, and Pete Domenici
of New Mexico, the top Republican on the Budget Committee --
have been conspicuous among those adding money for their home
states to spending bills.
   Mr. Bush said Democrats agreed at the last full meeting of
the bipartisan budget negotiators on July 26 to exchange
deficit-reduction proposals but didn't deliver. Democrats
deny that. "There may have been some miscommunication about
what was to happen," House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt
said several days later.
   Notes taken by participants in the talks show that
although there was no explicit promise from Rep. Gephardt,
who chairs the talks, he did indicate that the two sides
would present offers within days. In a subsequent caucus,
however, Democratic negotiators were unable to agree on the
wisdom of putting forward a proposal just before the start of
the monthlong congressional recess or on the precise details.
   Senate Democrats were the primary obstacle, Democratic
participants in the budget talks say. Mr. Bush suggested as
much yesterday by specifically exempting Missouri's Rep.
Gephardt and House Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington from
his harshest criticism.
   Although the Republicans didn't formally offer a plan, a
plan quickly leaked and has been criticized ever since -- by
Republicans as well as Democrats -- for suggesting higher
taxes on beer, wine and liquor as well as a $10,000 limit on
the deduction for state and local income taxes. Democrats sat
back and enjoyed the Republican disarray.
   "They've been laughing all the way to what they think is
the electoral bank," Mr. Bush said. "What I'm trying to do
now is to put it in focus so the American people will
understand that it is the Congress that must move now to
bring this deficit under control."
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine replied
that "the president's anger at the leak of the Republican
plan . . . should not serve as justification for unfair and
inaccurate criticisms of Democrats."
   Mr. Bush reiterated the administration's goal of reducing
the deficit by $50 billion in the first year and $500 billion
over five years. Administration officials acknowledge they
don't want to lower the target, even though some
congressional budget negotiators already are talking about a
smaller package, at least in the first year.
   All sides in the budget talks agree that the chances of
getting the kind of deep cuts in defense spending that some
Democrats have favored were reduced by the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. Mr. Bush yesterday referred to this by saying that
"our budget must maintain a defense posture consistent with
the demands on American leadership in the world and in the
dangers we face."
   The president also restated his support for cutting
capital gains taxes and his insistence on changing the
congressional budget process, which he termed "an utter
failure" at controlling spending.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
replied that Congress isn't solely responsible for the
deficits. "The policies of the Bush and Reagan
administrations must bear at least as much of the blame," he
said.
   "In most years, including this year, Congress has spent
less, not more, than President Bush or President Reagan
requested," Mr. Panetta said. "The president doesn't consider
it overspending when we spend on his priorities, only on
ours."

   Williamstown After Nikos

   Williamstown, Mass. -- Among the summer theaters that dot
the landscape like mosquitoes at a cookout, the Williamstown
Theater Festival is sui generis. Nestled in the Berkshire
mountains on the Williams College campus, the festival is now
in its 36th year. For most of those years the theater was
guided by the irrepressible Nikos Psacharopoulos. A man of
ineffable charm, no one knew more than he did about the care
and feeding of stage and film stars. Partly because of the
ambiance he created, and partly because of the loveliness of
the area, each year well-known performers would return to
Williamstown to take a respite from their commercial ventures
and appear in a classic by Chekhov or Pirandello.
   James Naughton, the star of Broadway's "City of Angels,"
has built a home here, as has Superman's Christopher Reeve.
Actresses Blythe Danner and Maria Tucci rented houses each
year to be in residence and provide for their children's
summer fun.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A year-and-a-half ago, however, Mr. Psacharopoulos
suddenly and unexpectedly died. He has been replaced by a
Williamstown old-timer, Peter Hunt. A veteran lighting
designer and director who is best known for his work on the
musical "1776," Mr. Hunt works in both New York and Hollywood
but has a special affection for Williamstown, where he has
been involved in 103 productions over a span of 27 seasons.
   Now, with the penultimate play of his first year it is
possible to get some idea of how he will fare as Mr.
Psacharopoulos's successor. To begin with, it should be said
that for all his charisma, Mr. Psacharopoulos could be
exasperating. The season frequently was a moving target; if
one of Mr. Psacharopoulos's favorite actresses suddenly made
it known she was available, he would scrap a planned
production and substitute a Tennessee Williams play. Also,
his renowned Chekhov offerings were often underrehearsed and
uneven.
   The first thing Mr. Hunt has done is introduce a measure
of planning and ordera very necessary ingredient if a theater
is to survive over the long term. To aid in this he has
appointed a well-known theater administrator, William
Stewart, as managing director. At the same time, Mr. Hunt has
developed a balanced program for the year: two lightweight
presentations, "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Forum" and "Harvey"; two ambitious works, Peter Weiss's
"Marat/Sade" and O'Neill's "A Moon for the Misbegotten"; and
the current offering, "Death Takes a Holiday," which manages
to be both slight and serious.
   This is just the kind of play a theater like Williamstown
should be producing. Written by the Italian playwright
Alberto Casella in the late 1920s and presented in this
country in an adaptation by Walter Ferris, it has not been
professionally produced here in well over a quarter of a
century. Set in an ornate Italian villa in which the designer
Hugh Landwehr has included echoes of the Gothic and baroque,
it tells the story of Death, in the person of Christopher
Reeve, deciding to take a three-day holiday. Duke Lambert
(Mr. Morfogen) and his friends have just returned to his
villa after a wild ride through the countryside in their two
cars. Both cars have been in serious accidents, but no one
has died. Late at night, the Duke learns why: Death,
enveloped in a black cape, appears out of the moonlight to
tell him that he plans to take three days off, during which
time no one will die. (We later hear that a man has plunged
from the Eiffel Tower without being killed.)
   The reason for the holiday is that Death wants to
experience life -- to enjoy beauty, to fall in love, to sleep
at night. "I haven't slept in ages," he says. The Duke and
Death conspire on a plan for him to be a guest in the house
for his three days. An expected visitor, Prince Sirki, is not
arriving because he had encountered Death earlier that
evening. "If I'd known he was a friend of yours, I would not
have met with him," Death tells the Duke. For his disguise,
Death becomes Prince Sirki.
   Those on hand at the villa include the Duke's wife and
son, an eccentric female visitor (Ms. Tucci), the Princess of
San Luca (Ms. Danner) and her daughter Grazia (Calista
Flockhart), engaged to the Duke's son (James Phoenix). The
entourage are all aristocrats, the men dressing for dinner
not just in tuxedoes but in tails, and there is something
both civilized and decadent about their life-style. The women
are simultaneously frightened and fascinated by the dashing
figure of Prince Sirki, who symbolizes death's fatal
attraction. As for the Prince, he decides that Grazia, the
appealing young bride-to-be, is the woman he will pursue. And
she falls in love with Death -- a romantic notion carried to
extreme.
   The play is pretentious in places, with portentous
discussions of how the living fail to live life to the
fullest, and in the second and third acts it slows to a crawl
more than once. On the whole, though, it is an effective
melodrama with just enough humor to prevent its being
meretricious. Mostly, it is a marvelous vehicle for the
longtime Williamstown favorites Mr. Hunt has assembled. Mr.
Morfogen is an authoritative but thoroughly alarmed Duke, Ms.
Danner and Ms. Tucci are fatally attractive themselves, and
newcomer Calista Flockhart is an appealing ingenue.
   As Death, Mr. Reeve is having a real holiday himself.
Eerily forbidding while wearing his cape and death mask, he
becomes a suave, enigmatic lover with palpably irresistible
charms. The saving grace for Mr. Reeve, as for the other
principals, is his sense of humor. With Mr. Hunt's guidance
the cast members successfully walk the thin line separating
camp from genuine humor. Watching them tear into this Gothic
romance, one realizes that the old hands at Williamstown have
decided to make the transition from the old to the new regime
without giving up the spontaneity and excitement of the
Psacharopoulos era, and while adding some stability and
common sense.

   When Economy Slides,
   PR May Get a Boost

<TEXT>
   DOES PR stand for Pending Recession? In today's public
relations environment, it may depend on one's specialty.
   Often in a softening economy, the public relations side of
a marketing program gets more attention because "it's so
cost-effective," says Arnold Huberman, who heads his own New
Yorkbased executive search firm. "Editorial mention is free"
compared with taking a full-page ad out, he notes. "The PR
agency business booms at times like this."
   One area particularly strong now is pharmaceutical PR.
Most drug manufacturers don't advertise directly to consumers
but instead aim their pitch at physicians. Often they'll
alert doctors well in advance of government approval of a
product, since there may be several competing items in the
pipeline. "Experienced product-marketing people in
pharmaceuticals have more leverage than the equivalently
experienced consumer-product person," Mr. Huberman says.
   But a marketing sector with little luster today is
financial services. "In its heyday, the industry was
jumping," reports Christopher Polson of Polson &amp; Co.,
Minneapolis. "Banks and S&amp;Ls were saying, `We're not just
bricks and mortar anymore. We're going to develop products
and services and market them.'" Some big New York banks
raided marketing-rich companies like Procter &amp; Gamble and
PepsiCo for talent. Not anymore, Mr. Polson says.
   Marketing skills always in demand: a combination of
in-field experience and the big-picture perspective. Mr.
Polson says there's no problem placing such experienced
talent into jobs with six-figure salaries. Often, their fast
track ascends quickly to general management slots.
                                                                                                       

   Using Fresh Muffins
   To Attract Fresh Money
                                                                                                       

   THE ADVICE "Dare to be different" is paying off for a
Missouri bank.
   Boatmen's National Bank of St. Louis is using high-gloss
sunglasses and gourmet muffins to catch corporate treasurers'
attention in the mundane world of cash-management services.
Rather than send out another letter and brochure, the
Boatmen's Bancshares unit recently mailed boxes containing
English muffins, jars of jelly, a knife and even a napkin to
1,400 prospects for its accounts-payable service.
   The product's key attribute is early reporting of checks
clearing a company's account, says the bank's Gordon Horn. So
its muffin message was, "While you're having breakfast,
Boatman's already has available to you the information you'll
need at the opening of your business day." The unusual
foot-in-the-door effort resulted in more than two dozen
warm-as-toast leads.
   To show how fast it can process receivables, the bank
played off fluorescent sunglasses seen in the film "Back to
the Future III," featuring speed-of-light travel.
   "Banks traditionally have taken the shotgun approach --
sending forces out prospecting in a willy-nilly fashion," Mr.
Horn says. "With direct marketing, we're more focused."
                                                                                                       

   Video's Vogue Grows
   As a Marketing Tool
                                                                                                       

   MORE FIRMS are finding that videotape can send marketing
drives into fast-forward.
   Book publisher Carol Publishing Group of New York makes a
video catalog of its new titles, featuring interviews with
the authors.
   The videotapes not only help distinguish Carol's offerings
in bookstore buyers' minds, they also "work better than
anything" in getting authors onto TV interview shows, says
Steven Schragis, publisher. "It shows a producer how a
segment can be done."
   For example, Carol's fall catalog cassette intersperses
reminiscences by ex-New York Police Commissioner Benjamin
Ward with news footage of manacled suspects.
   Another book, called "Kisses. . . ," is illustrated with a
string of movie-star embraces. And a mystery, Douglas J.
Keeling's "A Case of Innocence," is advertised through the
dramatization of a kidnapping that is central to the novel.
   But Mr. Schragis admits that some books don't translate
well into videotape presentations. The same goes for some
authors. "They may be wonderful writers, but they don't know
how to express themselves orally," he says.
   Not so with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The Southern
California Rapid Transit District recently passed out
thousands of videocassettes featuring the cartoon warriors
instructing would-be riders on a new rail line between Los
Angeles and Long Beach.
   The video, made in English and Spanish, views highway
tie-ups as a villain named Gridlock whom riders can foil by
riding the rails.

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   TO GET shareholders to read its annual report (they're
harder to swallow than pabulum) Gerber Products offered a
chance at 100 free shares of stock. The 44-page booklets came
with a five-question sweepstakes entry form; winners were
drawn at the company's annual meeting. . . . To capitalize on
its reputation, the Mayo Clinic this fall will publish a
$34.95 "family health book," described as a "hands-on" work
of more than 200 medical experts. . . . To catch would-be
advertisers' eyes, Playboy uses its fold-out, pin-up format
featuring repeat advertisers in the magazine. One
trade-journal ad shows a sprawled-out Panasonic executive in
a double-breasted suit. The accompanying headline: "I've
appeared in Playboy more times than Bo Derek."

   Dollar Posts Its Lowest New York Finish
   Against Mark on Possible Mideast Peace

   NEW YORK -- The dollar suffered its lowest New York finish
against its German counterpart yesterday.
   For the first time since the mark was created after World
War II, the U.S. currency was still being quoted below 1.57
marks at the time of day that foreign-exchange dealers
consider the end of global trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dollar's worst previous New York close occurred on
Dec. 31, 1987, when the greenback finished at 1.57 marks
exactly.
   The U.S. currency just barely steered clear of its
absolute bottom of 1.5615 marks, which it touched briefly in
the midst of trading on Jan. 4, 1988. In the late New York
afternoon yesterday, the dollar hit its intraday low of
1.5620 marks.
   Eager to sell the dollar because of the U.S.'s flirtation
with recession, dealers found an excuse with word that
Jordan's King Hussein had left for Washington bearing a
letter from Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Many participants
speculated that the letter contained an offer for
negotiations to resolve the Persian Gulf standoff, and they
sold the dollar on the possibility of peace.
   The dollar has fully retraced, and more, to its level at
the end of July, before Iraq invaded Kuwait and investors
bought into the U.S. safe haven.
   Yesterday's trading session was slipped into history books
"without a lot of fanfare," said Susan Stearns, senior
corporate foreign exchange adviser in New York for Chicago's
Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank. The dollar certainly didn't
tumble and at no point plunged; it was just walked downhill,
she said.
   But even if the dollar had fallen with a crash, few were
around to hear it. Other than the excitement created by
testing relatively new territory, everything seemed to be
discouraging participation in the currency market.
   August is the height of the European vacation season.
Those traders that remain in much of Continental Europe will
celebrate Assumption today. At the same time, the "O-Bon"
season, when Japanese return home, is at its height this
week.
   Add to that the lingering effects of Monday's blackout in
downtown New York. Many large banks and brokerages nearest to
the Brooklyn Bridge and the transformer there that caught on
fire were still without electricity yesterday.
   Among banks unable to operate were Credit Suisse, Lloyds
Bank, National Westminster Bank, and Australia &amp; New Zealand
Banking Group. Also closed yesterday were two of the U.S.'s
largest foreign exchange brokerages: Noonan, Astley &amp; Pearce
and Tullet &amp; Tokyo Forex.
   Dealing rooms trying to execute trades through a
diminished brokerage network were hampered by the loss of the
electronic direct dealing network over which about 85% of
interbank currency trades are usually executed.
   With many of their computer screens blank, dealers were
forced to pick up an unfamiliar dinosaur and dial. "People
are more reluctant to make prices over the telephone," said
Dennis Pettit, New York foreign exchange manager for
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. Beside not being used to
working by telephone, traders missed the automatic
transaction record that the electronic system offers, he
said.
   The result, Mr. Pettit said, was "severely curtailed
direct dealing."
   All systems were operating normally in the U.S. outside of
New York, but said Steve Flynn, a sterling dealer at Bank of
Boston, "With most of New York out, no one else wants to
play."
   Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.5645 marks, down from 1.5765 marks when trading came to a
halt in New York on Monday. Sterling was trading at $1.8981,
up from $1.8830 previously.
   The dollar's decline was led by strength in the Swiss
franc. Japanese investors were said to be repaying loans they
had taken out with the backing of Swiss bond holdings, said
Ms. Stearns of Harris Trust. The U.S. unit declined to 1.3040
Swiss francs from 1.3150 francs in New York about
midafternoon Monday.
   The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 148.78 yen,
down from 150.40 yen in New York Monday. Mr. Pettit said the
dollar was at first only sold against the Swiss franc and
mark, but when yen cross rates became attractive, the
Japanese currency was purchased as well.
   In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading soon after the
opening at 148.15 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of
149.90 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5665 marks; in Tokyo Tuesday, it closed at 1.5767 marks.
   Robert Mannolito, a New York trader with Commerzbank, said
the thin dealings ensured that dollar pricing went in only
one direction yesterday. Whenever the situation in the
Kuwait-Saudi Arabia frontier seems to settle down, dealers
sell the dollar.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $404.80 an ounce, up $7.90. Estimated
volume was a very heavy 6.5 million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted
at $404.60 an ounce.

   WASHINGTON -- In a highly unusual move, the Energy
Department is offering to act as an intermediary between
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. and a California community in a dispute
that is holding up production of as much as 100,000 barrels a
day of offshore oil.
   Department officials see resolution of the dispute over
the completed Point Arguello offshore oil project, near Santa
Barbara, Calif., as one of the fastest ways to help boost
U.S. oil production in the wake of possibly a four
million-barrel-a-day shortfall in world supplies because of
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

   The $2.5 billion project, built by a consortium of oil
companies led by the Chevron Corp. unit, consists of three
offshore drilling platforms that mechanically have been ready
to begin production for 2 1/2 years. But no oil has been
produced because of deep disagreements between the oil
companies and local communities over how to move the oil 130
miles downshore to refineries in Los Angeles.
   Los Angeles and other communities blocked construction of
a new pipeline, and California coastal officials rejected a
plan to move the oil by tanker.
   According to a department official, Energy Secretary James
Watkins agreed to explore ways to try to settle the dispute
after the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors voted
yesterday to send a letter inviting federal involvement. The
county board is responsible for granting the permits that
could get the project running.
   Chevron indicated it would speak with federal officials,
but it seemed determined to stick to its original plan of
seeking a new permit from the board in November to transport
the oil by tanker on an interim basis until it can build a
new pipeline or work out a way to use existing pipelines.
   "I don't think they {federal officials} have either the
capability or the legal ability to resolve an issue that has
dragged on as long as it has in Santa Barbara County," said a
Chevron spokesman. The Department of Energy "is free to do
what it can to provide advice and counsel, and we'd be happy
to hear what proposals they have. But Chevron and its
partners are not running to the DOE, and we don't want to be
perceived as somehow using this national crisis," he said.
   Without a declaration in Washington of a national energy
emergency, which isn't planned, it's unclear what powers of
mediation are open to the Energy Department. The department
has begun looking for options to break the logjam, including
the possibility of using the Coast Guard to help prevent a
tanker spill. Another option might be to make light crude
available from a U.S. naval petroleum reserve to mix with
heavy Point Arguello crude, which otherwise is too thick to
move down an existing pipeline to Los Angeles. But officials
cautioned they have just begun to explore the feasibility of
those options and to look for others.
   Besides the three oil-drilling platforms, one of which is
operated by Texaco Inc. and two by Chevron, the project
includes a new onshore oil-treating plant. The pipelines are
already in place from the platforms to the treatment plant.
The dispute is over how to ship the oil from the treatment
plant, where water and natural gas are split from the oil, to
a refinery. Chevron estimates the field contains at least 200
million to 300 million barrels of oil.
   The Chevron spokesman said the project could begin
production at about 20,000 barrels a day, building up to
about 75,000 barrels within a year and full production of
100,000 barrels a day within three years. But Energy
Department officials who have spoken to some of Chevron's 17
oil partners said they've heard estimates that the project
could produce as much as 40,000 to 80,000 barrels a day in as
early as three to six months, with full production of 100,000
barrels a day eventually.

   Leslie Wexner has an obsession with size. Just look at his
houses.
   He has a palatial abode in Columbus, Ohio, which he
considers home. For weekend getaways, he has one of the
biggest ski retreats in Aspen. And he has two Manhattan
townhouses, one a seven-story edifice that had been a private
school. All pale, however, beside the 60,000-square-foot
mansion he is building in a Columbus suburb. "The biggest
home ever in central Ohio," trumpeted Columbus Monthly
magazine recently.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Mr. Wexner's retailing dynasty, too, size appears to be
everything. In the past 27 years, Mr. Wexner's company,
Limited Inc., has expanded to 3,290 stores nationwide, making
it one of the country's fastest-growing, most ambitious
specialty-store companies. Last year, Limited generated $4.6
billion in sales, nearly four times those of the Saks Fifth
Avenue chain.
   But many think that the best days for U.S. retailing are
over. They blame too many malls, a weakening economy and
increasingly cautious consumers.
   Mr. Wexner knows all this. Yet he's still expanding as
fast as he can. And so far, Limited's earnings are
impressive; for the Aug. 4 quarter, the company reported
yesterday a 24% gain in net income to $79 million, or 22
cents a share, on a 17% rise in sales to $1.16 billion.
   "It is our clear intention to become a $10 billion company
with 10% after-tax profits by the mid-1990s," Mr. Wexner,
Limited's chairman, told banner-waving shareholders at its
annual meeting. "That is our dream, that is our common
vision, and that is what we are working toward."
   Yet even as the grandest houses can weather, so too is Mr.
Wexner's empire showing signs of wear and tear. In June and
July, dollar sales at its flagship division's stores that had
been open at least one year declined 5% from a year earlier,
analysts estimate. Partly as a result, Limited's stock has
lost more than 20% of its market value since a June stock
split. It closed yesterday at $19.50 a share, unchanged on
the day. Although other retail stocks have also slumped, this
is the first time Wall Street has expressed such doubts about
Mr. Wexner since women rejected short skirts three years ago.
   "Investors have been convinced that the Limited is
invincible," says Janet Mangano, an analyst at Jesup,
Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York. "But the company's core
businesses need to be updated if they are going to maintain
their levels of profitability. The economy is slowing. It's
tough times ahead for people selling discretionary items,
including the Limited."
   Mr. Wexner considers the doubters short-sighted. Bigger is
better, both for consumers and for the company, he says.
"Customers go where the inventories are."
   Since Mr. Wexner founded Limited in 1963, he has prospered
by appealing to retailing's refugees. His stores draw
teenagers (Limited and Express), fans of sexy lingerie
(Victoria's Secret) and big women ignored by the likes of
Calvin Klein (Lane Bryant). Limited also lures working women
who want to shop on Fifth Avenue (Lerner New York) and preppy
men who don't want to pay Ralph Lauren prices (Abercrombie &amp;
Fitch). The exception is Henri Bendel, whose affluent
customers are already served by many retailers.
   Mr. Wexner's obsession with growth, however, could be the
company's Achilles' heel. Over the past five years, he has
acquired Lerner, Bendel and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, all troubled
businesses. Like an old-fashioned 1960s conglomerateur, Mr.
Wexner believes that top performers such as Victoria's Secret
and Express can carry the laggards. He also thinks that his
keen fashion touch and low-cost offshore factories will
transform the acquisitions into mall superstars.
   But the turnarounds are taking longer than some observers
expected.
   Although the new Lerner stores are jazzy and upbeat, the
big chain continues to perform below potential, company
executives say. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch is still deciding whether
it's a men's store or a fancy gift shop. And Bendel, which
once appealed to a small universe of tiny-waisted women, is
searching for roots in meat-and-potatoes markets such as
Chicago and Columbus. Earlier this year, its much-touted
former president departed under pressure.
   Adding to Mr. Wexner's difficulties, a critical new
clothing line at the company's flagship Limited division has
proved a slow seller. And even Lane Bryant, which has long
dominated the large-size business, is stirring concern.
   The man behind Limited Inc. seems driven partly by a
powerful mixture of anger and pride. Nearly 30 years ago, his
late father, Harry Wexner, abruptly fired him from the
family's small clothing store in Columbus. "He told me I was
clumsy as an ox and didn't have any aptitude for the
business," says Mr. Wexner, now 53 years old. "It was a very
stereotypical father-and-son conflict."
   The company Mr. Wexner says he launched to prove his
father wrong reflected his modest resources. "It was
early-Midwest family room with beams and stucco," recalls
Carol Farmer, a retail consultant who grew up in Columbus.
"But you had to shop there. Les had taste, and he worked like
a demon." Mr. Wexner named his store the Limited because the
offerings were limited to cheap but trendy women's sportswear
-- blouses with Peter Pan collars, madras shorts, Shetland
sweaters.
   Limited blossomed along with the nation's growing freeway
system, which provided access to regional malls. One store
became two, two became four. As he expanded, Mr. Wexner
sought out older, more experienced businessmen for advice.
How far could you expand out of town? he asked. Could you go
little by little, or could you leapfrog over geographical
areas?
   "Success fanned his emotions," says Gordon Schiffman, an
original board member. "He always wanted to be the best
women's clothier in the country. He was intense, a bundle of
enthusiasm. Finally, though, he asked me to step down.
`Gordie,' he said, `I appreciate everything you've done, but
I need somebody with a bigger attitude.'"
   As long as the U.S. economy was in overdrive, Mr. Wexner
could translate his ambitions into double-digit gains in
annual sales and earnings. But now shoppers are cutting back.
Real-estate prices are down. Unemployment has risen to 5.5%.
Talk of a recession is growing. Bankruptcy filings have
stalled classy competitors such as Rich's and Bloomingdale's.
   Mr. Wexner has weathered such storms before, but this one
is hitting just when he is pushing an unprecedented
expansion. This year, he is adding 2.75 million square feet
of new selling space to his 14.4-million-square-foot base. He
intends to add over three million more square feet in 1991.
The building is necessary if Mr. Wexner is to achieve $10
billion in sales and earnings of $1 billion by 1995 -- the
pledge that had fueled much of the stock gains.
   Mr. Wexner is building bigger stores and more of them
because he believes that customers short of time will flock
to stores set up to meet all their needs. "People's attitudes
and social habits change," he says. "Customers going to a
shopping center today would rather go to a store of
preference, where they can find what they want, rather than
10 specialty stores."
   But his bigger-is-better theory, which worked so well for
so long at the Limited's flagship division, isn't infallible.
   In early summer, as temperatures began to climb above 80
degrees in the Northeast, Limited managers began to ship
truckloads of heavy fall blazers, coats and pants bearing the
new, hard-to-pronounce Paul et Duffier label. This was well
in advance of competitors. The chain's Forenza label, which
once conveyed the latest in street fashion from Milan and
Paris, was being phased out, and its buyers wanted to move as
fast as possible with as much as possible.
   It proved a mistake.
   June sales at stores open at least one year unexpectedly
dropped an estimated 5% at the Limited group. Because this
division produces nearly one-third of corporate earnings,
shareholders panicked. In one day, the stock plunged nearly
10%. Since the June stock split, Mr. Wexner himself has
suffered a paper loss of more than $500 million on his l03.5
million shares (nearly 30% of the common shares outstanding).
   A recent walk through the Limited store on New York's
stylish Madison Avenue found the racks crowded with Paul et
Duffier wool blazers marked down from $149 to $89. Upstairs,
a group of Paul et Duffier fall coats was $225 instead of
$350. But even at these discounts, little was selling. One
saleswoman, dressed in a linen blouse and cotton skirt,
looked across a department devoid of customers and said,
"It's too hot to try those clothes on."
   Limited insists that the promotions are part of a plan to
introduce the new line and that it will fine-tune the
mistakes. But shrewd competitors, such as the Gap, offered
customers brighter colors in lighterweight fabrics. And in
the image-driven fashion business, first impressions are
often lasting impressions.
   "Forcing sale prices on shoppers today is stealing
business from the future," says Kurt Barnard, publisher of
Barnard's Retail Marketing Report. "It's grim news for them,
no question about it. The Limited apparently bought a great
deal of this merchandise, and it isn't selling."
   Behind Limited's stumble is a bold attempt to lure older,
more affluent consumers instead of teen-agers and women in
their early 20s.
   Sipping coffee in one of his East Side Manhattan
townhouses, Mr. Wexner says he has the world's best job. But
he may be one of retailing's most aloof monarchs. This
committed bachelor has said he never has had time to settle
down. Here, where the living-room walls are covered with a
special egg-shell crackle wallpaper, Picassos compete with De
Koonings for space. It is a serene tableau but devoid of
photographs of friends or family.
   Mr. Wexner is an enigma in the often-glamorous world of
retailing, where jaunty personalities such as Marvin Traub of
Bloomingdale's have become society figures. After rejecting
his second White House dinner invitation because it
interfered with business plans, Mr. Wexner was told he
wouldn't be asked again. That didn't upset him. "I didn't
think my presence was necessary at a sit-down dinner for
300," Mr. Wexner says blandly.
   Even in Columbus, he rarely joins the formal-dinner set.
"I don't think there are many people here who know him well,"
says one prominent hostess, requesting anonymity because her
husband is a business associate of Mr. Wexner's. "The man is
a workaholic. Everything else is basically a distraction."
   But if Mr. Wexner lacks social ambition, he evidently
hungers for the status accorded people who succeed at
managing big department-store chains.
   Twice he has failed in efforts to acquire the Carter
Hawley Hale chain. Last year, he approached executives at
R.H. Macy &amp; Co. about taking an equity stake in that huge
retailer. Most recently, he secretly backed a management-led
buy-out attempt at Marshall Field. Had that bid succeeded, he
would have emerged as a substantial minority shareholder.
   Meanwhile, Mr. Wexner continues to tinker with Henri
Bendel and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Recently he even suggested
that both could well become $1 billion companies -- very big
by retailing standards. This is why some have begun to wonder
whether his fixation on upper-crust customers may be
affecting his judgment.
   "He seems to believe that if he is going to be a legend,
he needs to attract the affluent, fashionable, mature woman,"
suggests George Rosenbaum, president of Leo J. Shapiro, a
Chicago-based market-research firm. Referring to the Henri
Bendel chain, Mr. Rosenbaum adds:
   "We're talking about serving the princesses of America.
These aren't the neglected women Mr. Wexner has nurtured in
the past. He relishes a test, but this is a much riskier
thing than he has ever done before. There's reason to be
dubious."
   Admittedly, Mr. Wexner has frequently surprised skeptics.
Many analysts deem his retailing skills second only to those
of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton. Eventually, both Henri Bendel
and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch may indeed emerge as hits. "He has
enough income to support what amounts to research and
development," says New York investment banker Gilbert
Harrison. "He won't give up."
   But the uncertain futures of those chains underscore Mr.
Wexner's problem. At some point, sales and profits at even
Express and Victoria's Secret, among the company's strongest
divisions, will begin to mature. And Mr. Wexner can't be sure
what will replace them.
   This is why he is experimenting with a raft of niche
businesses. Besides Henri Bendel and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch,
these include bath shops, men's clothing shops, children's
businesses and yet more lingerie under the Cacique label.
William Smith and Margaret McKenna, analysts at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co., also think that Mr. Wexner may soon
launch a cosmetics and related-products line.
   "The thing about Les is that he really believes that trees
grow to the sky," one close adviser says. "They don't. He
owns some remarkable businesses today, but there are no
guarantees that he will be able to build new ones."
   But Mr. Wexner is characteristically upbeat. In early
August, he opened a new Henri Bendel store at the Atrium in
Chestnut Hill, a Boston suburb chockablock with luxury-goods
retailers. To ensure that his entry is noticed, Mr. Wexner
has graced it with a grand staircase, tons of marble and a
gilded dome over the cosmetics department. And with 40,000
square feet spread over three levels, it's the biggest store
in the mall.

   Air Products &amp; Chemicals Inc. said the sale of equity in
an energy project will produce a one-time gain of $6 million,
or 11 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ending Sept. 30.
The company said this shouldn't affect analysts' consensus

   Air Products, based in Allentown, Pa., said the gain will
come from the sale of a 50% equity interest in a $190 million

   How Suying Cantrelle Stood Up to a Gang of Toughs

   Fighting Crime Can Be Particularly

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- In early 1988, Vietnamese toughs
began to show up in Suying Cantrelle's general store here and
"walk around like they were big bosses," the store owner
recalls. They demanded money, at one point asking for $100 a
day, and threatened to kill her brother if she didn't comply,
the former Saigon resident adds.
   But Mrs. Cantrelle, who at at five foot one and 85 pounds
looks barely strong enough to stand up against a good breeze,
didn't intend to back down. "We have a responsibility to
clean up our community," she says. "If we keep quiet, things
are just going to get worse."
   Instead of paying, she went to the police and pushed
reluctant witnesses to step forward. Three men were
eventually arrested. Though authorities couldn't gather
enough evidence to win extortion convictions, the defendants
were found guilty in a state court here of assault and
weapons charges. "Without Suying there wouldn't have been a
case," says Steven Harrold, the deputy district attorney who
prosecuted the case. "She's a very brave lady."
   The alleged shakedown of Mrs. Cantrelle's business is an
all-too-familiar tale for entrepreneurs, who are often
victims of the rise in crime. Resisting criminals is hard --
and scary.
   Immigrant entrepreneurs such as Mrs. Cantrelle are often
especially vulnerable. Law-enforcement officials say they
believe extortion against Asian businesses is widespread. But
victims, often fearful of retribution, unable to speak
English well and harboring a distrust of the police that was
ingrained in their homelands, rarely report the crime, the
officials say.
   The dangers range from street gangs that terrorize Asian
communities to more sophisticated groups such as the Wah
Ching. A one-time Chinese youth gang, the Wah Ching has
turned into a "significant organized criminal group" with
nationwide operations in everything from narcotics
trafficking and murder to extortion and loansharking,
according to a 1989 report by the federal General Accounting
Office.
   At the Cantrelle trial, an acknowledged Wah Ching member
admitted to taking part in the beating of a vendor at Mrs.
Cantrelle's store. He also told of extorting money from Asian
businesses in San Francisco and coming to Sacramento looking
for new victims. However, he denied making any extortion
attempts against Mrs. Cantrelle's business and said the
beating stemmed from a personal dispute.
   The testimony of Vi Khuu, the vendor who was beaten, shows
how difficult it can be for a small business owner such as
Mrs. Cantrelle to buck the tide and fight such gangs. Mr.
Khuu testified that in Vietnam suspected criminals could
bribe their way out of custody and go after their victims
again. Mr. Khuu, who runs a jewelry counter in Mrs.
Cantrelle's store, said he was afraid the same thing would
happen in the U.S.
   What nudged Mr. Khuu and others to testify was the
perseverance of Mrs. Cantrelle. As the problem unfolded,
"there were a lot of late-night sessions at people's homes
where she convinced them they had to talk," recalls Mrs.
Cantrelle's husband, Joseph. Mr. Harrold says there were
points in the case where he was sure some of the witnesses
would have backed out if not for Mrs. Cantrelle. "She was a
very strong victim," adds Darrell Fong, the Sacramento police
detective who investigated the case.
   Mrs. Cantrelle, who came to Sacramento from Vietnam in
1974, has long been an activist. For years, she worked for
social-service organizations. In her spare time, she has
raised money for local families in need and acted as an
interpreter for them with government agencies.
   She says she started the Vinh Phat Market in 1984 largely
as a way to employ the increasing number of family members
coming into the Sacramento area. The one-story building of
stucco and corrugated metal is part food store, part emporium
and part art mart. Live catfish and 50-pound bags of rice
share space with racks of rumpled suits, piles of shoes and
brightly colored oriental statues. She presides over it all
from a windowless back office crammed with boxes of beauty
cream, cigarettes and other inventory.
   Shortly after the money demands began in 1988, Mr. Khuu
was marched out from behind his jewelry counter at gunpoint
and beaten in the parking lot. He testified that the next day
he received a telephone call demanding $3,000. "He was beaten
as an example to show they meant business," says Mr. Harrold.
   At the trial, Mr. Khuu testified he didn't return to work
for three weeks out of fear for his safety. And Mrs.
Cantrelle's brother testified he was told that if money
wasn't forthcoming, he should "be prepared to buy a coffin."
The defense contended that any dispute was due to money owed
the defendants by Mrs. Cantrelle's family, an assertion she
heatedly denied.
   Several weeks after Mr. Khuu's beating, there was a
shootout at the market between two of the defendants and a
local gambler. Though nobody was hurt, Mrs. Cantrelle says
that helped convince remaining doubters of the need to
cooperate with the police.
   After she went to the police, Mrs. Cantrelle says she
walked out of Vinh Phat one evening to find four men in a car
pointing a camera at her. Suspecting the worst, she hopped in
her car and gave chase.
   She wheeled her car in front of theirs at a red light,
blocking them along with most of the intersection. She
marched over, demanding the camera. "I figured they wouldn't
kill me with everyone else around," she says. But the men
managed to slip their car around hers and get away.
   After all this, "Suying has become a kind of cult heroine"
in the immigrant community in Sacramento, says Philip
Isenberg, a state assemblyman who sponsored a legislative
commendation for Mrs. Cantrelle as an immigrant who resisted
gang wrongdoing. He also recently had her testify in support
of a bill to set up a statewide hotline for immigrants to
phone in anonymous tips on criminal activities.
   Mrs. Cantrelle is upset that more of her fellow Asian
business owners aren't speaking up as she has. She believes
many are being shaken down and silently paying. "If they are
being robbed, I don't feel sorry for them," she says. "They
haven't stood up."

<LP>
   Crown Resources Corp. expects to report a loss of about
$830,000, or seven cents a share, for the second quarter
ended June 30, but company Chairman Mark Jones told Dow Jones
the mining company should be profitable in the second half of
the year. Crown, which has been producing gold with a joint
venture partner since February, had revenue of about $1.8
million for the quarter. In the year-ago second quarter, the
Denver-based company reported a loss of about $323,000, or
four cents a share, on no revenue. Average shares outstanding
have increased about 37% to 12.3 million shares.
   For the first six months, the company expects to report
net income of nearly $2.2 million, or about 17 cents a share,
compared with a loss of about $618,000, or about seven cents
a share. Revenue for the first six months of 1990 was nearly
$1.9 million compared with about $3,000 for the first six
months last year. The net income in the most recent six
months includes a $5 million gain recorded in the first
quarter on the sale of a property option.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Crown, which is primarily an exploration company, is also
exploring for gold on three other properties: one at the
southern end of the Carlin Trend in Nevada, one on the Utah
trend and one in northern Washington near its Crown Jewel
property. The company said its finding costs so far have
averaged only $5 an ounce, well below the industry average.

   WINDSOR, Ont. -- Chrysler Corp. chairman Lee A. Iacocca
said the auto maker has discussed potential ties with three
European manufacturers, but said there won't be an agreement
within the next month and dismissed the possibility of a
full-scale merger.
   Mr. Iacocca, speaking at a plant ceremony marking the
start of production for the 1991 minivans, said Chrysler has
talked with Regie Nationale des Usines Renault of France,
Volvo AB of Sweden and Fiat S.p.A. of Italy. He also said
Chrysler has talked with several other auto companies about
possible arrangements.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The negotiations with Fiat have sparked speculation in
Europe and the U.S. that the Italian company may agree to
distribute Chrysler products in Europe, help Chrysler develop
new vehicles or, possibly, buy a sizable equity stake in
Chrysler.
   Mr. Iacocca said an equity stake by another auto maker in
Chrysler isn't imminent, but may come in the future.
   The company later clarified Mr. Iacocca's comments about
Renault and Volvo talks, saying those discussions primarily
involve "commercial arrangements."
   Chrysler shares fell 12.5 cents yesterday to $13.125 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   "Everybody's talking to everybody," Mr. Iacocca said. "I
think over time everybody's going to need some kind of
affiliation or partnership."

   J.C. Penney Net
   Was Down 15%
   In Second Quarter

<LP>
   DALLAS -- J.C. Penney Co., reporting a
larger-than-expected 15% drop in second-quarter earnings,
blamed the decline on a weak economy that company officials
and industry observers fear is growing weaker.
   Penney earnings dropped to $83 million, or 63 cents a
share, from $98 million, or 74 cents a share, the year
earlier. Revenue rose a meager 4.5%, to $3.83 billion from
$3.67 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Penney attributed the earnings decline primarily to slack
consumer demand -- a problem likely to worsen in light of
what's happened since July 28, when Penney's second quarter
ended. "Rising prices at the pump mean that consumers have
reduced spending power," said Ira Silver, Penney's chief
economist.
   Not only that, Mr. Silver said, but higher energy prices
resulting from the Mideast crisis "clearly affect a lot of
things J.C. Penney sells -- synthetic clothes, sneakers, any
product with an oil-related content."
   With the costs of those products likely to rise, Mr.
Silver said the company is in a bind. "There is pressure for
price increases" on Penney products, he said. But if, for
instance, the company raises the price of a sweater, "our
(fear) is, nobody's going to buy it," he said, because "the
economy is weak."
   Analysts, aware that many retailers experienced soft sales
in May and June, expected a decline in Penney's
second-quarter earnings, but not of such magnitude. "It was
several cents below what I expected," said N. Richard Nelson
Jr. of Duff &amp; Phelps, who in response lowered his year-end
earnings projections for Penney to $6.25 a share from $6.50.
   The market responded by skewering the stock, which dropped
$2 to close yesterday at $48.50 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.
   The economy wasn't entirely to blame. "Dillards, Limited,
the Gap, Dayton Hudson, are doing all right," asserted Edward
Weller, retailer analyst at Montgomery Securities. But
compared with those chains, Penney, which is trying to evolve
from a frumpy mass merchant to a trendy specialty retailer,
lacks clear focus and a sharp image, according to some
observers. "Penney is improving its image, but it still has a
ways to go," said Mr. Nelson.
   In a weakening economy, completing its repositioning could
become all the more difficult. "It's harder to make changes
when the economy goes soft," said Mr. Weller, adding that
Penney is "caught midstream."
   Penney Chairman William R. Howell acknowledged that the
company's repositioning contributed to the disappointing
quarter. "As we bring our merchandise in line with an
appropriate department store mix, we are temporarily giving
up some volume in conservative women's sportswear," he said.
   But he added that "neither the refining of our merchandise
mix nor the costs associated with the development of new
specialty businesses would be particularly felt if the
economic climate were more favorable."
   For the six months ended July 28, Penney said its earnings
rose 5% to $237 million, or $1.84 a share, from $226 million,
or $1.71 a share, the year earlier. Six-month revenue rose
5.4% to $7.64 billion from $7.24 billion.
   Separately, May Department Stores Co. said net income in
the fiscal second quarter, ended Aug. 4, was flat with
year-earlier results of $78 million. However, earnings per
share rose 5% to 58 cents from 55 cents because fewer shares
are now outstanding. And earnings from continuing operations
-- excluding May's discontinued discount store units --
increased a more robust 10% to $78 million from $71 million a
year earlier.
   The St. Louis-based retailer said sales rose 9% to $2.19
billion from $2.04 billion a year earlier.
   The results, which were in line with analysts'
expectations, sent May shares up $1.625 to close at $46.625
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. "Some
people are probably selling J.C. Penney and buying May," said
Mr. Weller of Montgomery Securities.

   NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp. adjourned its annual

approval of its recapitalization plan from shareholders.
   Western Union plans to reconvene the annual meeting today
at noon at the Ramada Inn in Montvale, N.J.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company has said it will have to seek bankruptcy-law
protection if it cannot win approval of the plan to
reclassify its preferred stock into common shares and
exchange new debt securities and common stock for its present
senior notes.
   Last month, a representative for the company's bondholders
said that most would be willing to go along with the exchange
offer.
   However, the company must first get stockholder approval
of the reclassification. A spokesman said the company is
close to getting the two-thirds majority vote necessary to
approve the reclassification.
   Meanwhile, Western Union's negotiations over a new
three-year contract with the Communications Workers of
America grew intense. The CWA filed a complaint with the
National Labor Relations Board, charging Western Union with
unfair labor practices after it locked out 2,500 unionized
workers over the weekend and replaced them with nonunion
workers.
   The workers, including employees in the company's central
telephone bureaus, computer centers and other facilities had
been working without a contract since midnight Aug. 6 when
the old contract expired. However, Western Union said it
couldn't operate "under the ever-present threat" of a strike
as it tried to work out a new contract.

   NEW YORK -- Donald J. Trump named Stephen F. Bollenbach,
who had been chief financial officer of Promus Companies, as
the new -- and first -- chief financial officer of the Trump
Organization.
   The appointment, made at the behest of Mr. Trump's banks,
essentially gives Mr. Bollenbach the task of saving the
one-time billionaire's empire.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While at Promus, Mr. Bollenbach helped engineer a spinoff
of the company's Holiday Inns division, giving equity holders
a $65-a-share dividend. Mr. Bollenbach also has acted as
chief financial officer for Daniel Ludwig, the shipping
magnate who lost $1 billion in a project in Brazil.
   He will face serious challenges in his new position with
Mr. Trump, who has never employed a chief financial officer
before. Asked about the task before him, Mr. Bollenbach said:
"This is just like the Super Bowl."
   The most pressing problem will be to persuade holders of
$1.3 billion in bonds secured by Mr. Trump's three Atlantic
City casinos to forfeit $215 million in principal and
interest payments over the next year. In return, Mr. Trump is
expected to offer bondholders equity in his properties.
   Other Trump assets, such as the Plaza Hotel and Trump
Shuttle, also aren't making enough money to meet their
interest payments. Under a $65 million bank loan agreement
negotiated in June, Mr. Trump will defer interest on some of
his loans.
   "There are some wonderful assets," Mr. Bollenbach said.
"The problem is finding the best financing given the bad
economy in the Northeast."
   Meanwhile, Mr. Trump suffered a setback in the Apellate
Division of New Jersey Superior Court yesterday when a panel
of judges refused to overturn a New Jersey Casino Control
Commission ruling requiring Mr. Trump to release sensitive
financial documents related to his bank loans. Mr. Trump's
attorneys are expected to appeal the decision to New Jersey
Supreme Court today.

   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan said the economic slump in New England isn't likely
to provoke a national recession and won't "interfere with the
conduct of monetary policy in a fundamental way."
   In a written statement responding to a letter from Senate
Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), Mr.
Greenspan said the central bank "doesn't have the tools to
deal surgically with regional or sectoral problems."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Greenspan said the current slump in New England stems
from "setbacks" in the defense, high-tech and
financial-services industries. This brought a downturn in
real estate, which in turn left banks and other lenders with
heavy losses.
   "I don't see the sort of direct contagion in these
problems that will lead to national recession, and while they
are an important feature of the economic and financial
environment that must be considered as we make our decisions,
I don't believe that they `interfere' with the conduct of
monetary policy in a fundamental way," he said.

   Taiwan Investors Flee Stock Markets,
   Unit Trusts as Middle East Crisis Erupts

<LP>
   Taiwan's investors are learning some harsh lessons about
playing Asian-Pacific stock markets. At the same time they
are administering a costly lesson to foreign unit-trust
managers who have eagerly courted them in the past three
years.
   Since the Middle East crisis erupted, analysts and fund
managers say, Taiwanese capital has been fleeing the region's
stock markets in an unexpectedly large wave. The flood of
sales has battered the smaller markets, especially Thailand,
and forced significant redemptions in some unit trusts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts say the sell-off underscores Taiwanese investors'
short-term outlook and limited sophistication in overseas
investing. That combination, especially in light of huge
levels of cash still in Taiwan, poses problems for regional
trading.
   The sales follow steady increases in Taiwanese investment
throughout the region since February, when the Taipei market
began a sobering downturn that has knocked 70% off share
prices. To escape sour market conditions at home, many
Taiwanese investors jumped into unit trusts, which offer
broad regional exposure without the need for extensive market
knowledge. They also scouted the region for promising
individual shares, focusing with particular zeal on
low-capitalization stocks in Thailand.
   Analysts say Taiwanese investors also exported the
speculative practices common in the Taipei market. According
to the analysts, the Taiwanese pumped up shares to draw in
local investors, then sold quickly once prices were driven
higher. "Ramping," as the practice is called, has played a
major role in the Taipei stock market's volatility.
   With many Asian funds showing strong returns in recent
months, the Taiwanese were prevalent among those who took the
opportunity to take profits when the Iraqi tanks rolled into
Kuwait. The full extent of the sales is difficult to gauge,
because most Taiwanese investment is by individuals -- often
with designated nominees -- operating through foreign
brokers, and their overseas remittances are virtually
impossible to track. But last week the Taiwanese redeemed
enough holdings in unit trusts to force foreign trust
managers to unload shares on several markets.
   Some Hong Kong-based unit-trust managers report that the
Taiwanese figured prominently in the redemptions. For
example, Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd. says its $75 million
Little Dragons Fund had a 7% redemption. "Almost all of it
was Taiwanese," says fund manager Gavin Graham.
   The scope of Taiwanese investment in Thailand is suggested
by redemptions in Jardine Fleming &amp; Co.'s JF Thailand Trust.
Roger Ellis, the unit trust's manager, says 15% to 20% of the
$200 million fund was redeemed by investors. He says
statistics aren't available on the Taiwanese portion but
adds: "Our experience is not a great deal different from
other people's."
   In Taipei, the foreign brokers who market single-country
and regional unit trusts, and the Taiwanese banks that act as
sales agents, report a very sharp increase in redemptions in
the past two weeks. According to figures compiled by Jardine
Fleming Taiwan Ltd., in the five business days after the
Iraqi invasion, about 2 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$73.3
million) of overseas unit-trust investments were redeemed by
Taiwanese. That represents 5.7% of the NT$35 billion that was
in the unit trusts at the end of July. Some analysts estimate
that more than NT$2.73 billion has been sold since Aug. 1.
   The head of the trust-banking department at a Taiwanese
bank, who declines to be identified, says that in the 13 days
to Aug. 13, NT$56 million of unit-trust investments was
redeemed at that bank, compared with NT$28 million in all of
June and only NT$7 million in May. Redemptions in unit trusts
managed by Jardine Fleming and Fidelity Securities Investment
Consulting Corp., which are estimated to hold more than 65%
of Taiwan's foreign unit-trust investments, made up nearly
NT$50 million of the bank's total redemptions.
   "We have received some big, heavy redemptions," says
Christina Sung, a vice president with Jardine Fleming Taiwan,
which says it has the largest share of the island's
unit-trust market. "The ones we marketed the most are the
ones which received the heaviest redemption."
   Fidelity, meanwhile, says that it has experienced a lower
level of redemptions than others, largely because it has
relatively low sales of unit trusts that focus on Southeast
Asian markets. Danny Chan, Fidelity's managing director in
Taiwan, says Taiwanese investors are more heavily weighted
toward unit trusts that invest in European markets, which
have been less affected by the Middle East crisis.
   Despite the huge sell-off, Taiwan's involvement in foreign
unit trusts represents a very small portion of the island's
investment capital: The NT$35 billion invested in such unit
trusts at the end of July was equivalent to less than an
hour's trading on the Taipei stock exchange at the height of
the market's boom.
   In addition to their regional unit-trust investments, the
Taiwanese have cultivated relationships with Bangkok brokers
to facilitate purchases of individual Thai stocks. According
to several analysts, Taiwanese investors now even have
computer access in Taipei to up-to-the-minute Bangkok stock
quotes.
   The computer link, usually through a financial-consultancy
company in Taipei, allows Taiwanese investors to be active
participants in Bangkok trading. In addition to the
technological tie-up, however, Taiwan investors have formed
stock groups that send buying delegations to Thailand.
   The Taiwanese speculators have caught the eye of
Thailand's market regulators. In a sign of the growing
concern even before the Iraqi invasion, the exchange sent a
circular to all 35 Thai brokers warning them about Taiwanese
investors.
   The president of the Association of Members of the
Securities Exchange of Thailand went a step further. He
warned that such speculative behavior by the Taiwanese
threatened to bring the same instability to Thailand that had
debilitated the Taipei market since the beginning of the
year.

   NEW YORK -- Many growth-stock managers have taken the
recent market sell-off as a chance to buy stocks that
previously traded at lavish multiples of earnings. Not Foster
Friess.
   He has jacked up the cash holdings of the mutual fund he
manages, the $250 million Brandywine Fund, to more than 60%
of assets. "I'm willing to have egg on my face . . . to avoid
the risk that this is going to be something nasty," says Mr.
Friess.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Friess's anxiety is noteworthy because he has a good
long-term track record. He is ranked by CDA Investment
Technologies as the country's second best money manager for
the five years ended June 30, with an annualized total return
of 23.7%, compared with 17.3% for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
stocks.
   And there's no question that he's unusually nervous. Mr.
Friess has gone heavily into cash just three times in his
long investment career. Right now is one of those times.
   "The market is saying that {the Middle East crisis} will
blow over and that there won't be a military conflagration,"
says 50 year-old Mr. Friess, whose money-management firm is
based in Greenville, Del. "I sure hope that happens, but I
still want to be cautious."
   Such a radical move into cash is unusual for any money
manager, but particularly for a growth-stock picker. Many
growth-stock managers remain fully invested in stocks at all
times, and some now wish they had even more cash to put to
work in the stock market.
   "I just think it's a heck of an opportunity," says
Pasadena Growth Fund's Roger Engemann. "Pretty soon people
will get bored with the blockade, because it's like watching
grass grow. They'll start concentrating on other things, and
one of the things they'll look at are growth stocks."
   G. Kenneth Heebner's top performing New England Growth
Fund went into the August sell-off fully invested in stocks,
and he plans to keep the fund that way. "There are a lot of
stocks out there for which this is a buying opportunity,"
says Mr. Heebner. He likes the drug stocks, some medical
product companies and the oil service companies.
   For his part, Mr. Friess says he hopes that he is wrong.
"I'll be very happy if the people I sold stock to make a lot
of money," he says.
   Mr. Friess made the decision to raise cash Aug. 3, the day
after Iraqi troops stormed into Kuwait. It took Mr. Friess
and his team of portfolio managers just 20 minutes to reach
the decision. "We sat here in my office and talked about the
pluses or minuses," says Mr. Friess. "We felt this was the
best decision for our clients."
   On that Friday, Friess Associates Inc., which manages $1
billion in its mutual fund and in private accounts, sold
stock valued at close to $250 million. Over the next three
business days, the firm continued to sell heavily as the
stock market first tanked and then recovered modestly.
   Mr. Friess says it wasn't just the Middle East crisis that
prompted his flight to cash. On Aug. 2, the day before he
started selling, he had been in Washington, D.C., for a
meeting of the U.S. Senatorial Trust, an exclusive group of
Republican Party backers who occasionally meet with key
government officials.
   He came away from the meeting convinced that, because of
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, it would now be tougher than
ever to meet this year's budget-deficit reduction target.
Boosting gasoline taxes and slashing the military budget had
been widely discussed as ways of paring the deficit. But
following Iraq's invasion and the jump in oil prices, Mr.
Friess thinks both options may be dead.
   "There are very few stocks that we didn't sell some of,"
says Mr. Friess. But he has held on to a large part of his
position in such stocks as Adolph Coors, Sun Microsystems
Inc., Novell Inc., SynOptics Communications Inc., Stewart &amp;
Stevenson Services Inc., United HealthCare Corp., U.S.
Healthcare Inc., Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., Biomet Inc. and
St. Jude Medical Inc. "They have things going for them that
won't be impacted as much by Iraq and things happening in the
budget area," he says.
   For Mr. Friess, holding more than the smallest amount of
cash is a rarity. He generally remains fully invested in the
stocks of companies that are enjoying rapid earnings and
sales growth. Last year, the no-load Brandywine Fund surged
33% on the backs of such highflying stocks as L.A. Gear and
Nike. The fund requires a $25,000 minimum investment.
   Only twice before has Mr. Friess gone heavily into cash,
in 1973 following the imposition of the Arab oil embargo and
in 1979, after the Shah of Iran was toppled. The first move
to cash paid off handsomely; the second move didn't.
   For now, the normally aggressive Mr. Friess is left to
count his cash and wait patiently for events in the Middle
East to play themselves out. "So what if we're on the
sidelines and we underperform for the next quarter or the
next two quarters?" he says. "I'm going to be in this
business for the next 40 quarters or 80 quarters."

   Gap Inc. Expects
   To Post 30% Rise
   In 2nd-Period Net

<LP>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Gap Inc., heading off a general slump in
retailing, expects to report more than a 30% increase in
fiscal second-quarter net on a 24% increase in sales.
   Donald Fisher, chairman and chief executive officer, said
in an interview that net for the period ending Aug. 4 would
be more than 30% higher than net of 40 cents reported in the
year-earlier second quarter. He said sales in the latest
quarter were $405 million, up 24% from $326 million a year
earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts had expected Gap to earn in the range of 45 cents
to 50 cents a share. The results are also somewhat surprising
because the apparel company got such a poor start to the
quarter. Comparable store sales rose a disappointing 6% in
May as inclement weather doused the traditional beginning of
the summer buying season. After the May report, some analysts
reduced estimates of second-quarter net for the company to as
low as 33 cents.
   Mr. Fisher said warmer weather and strong consumer
acceptance of new merchandise in mid-June helped to correct
things. Comparable store sales rose 24% in June and 28% in
July -- and a strong 19% increase for the quarter. Margins
were "very, very good" because of the popular new merchandise
and the reduced need for discounting, he added. Mr. Fisher
also cited "meaningful" progress at the Banana Republic
division, a perennial money-loser that should turn a profit
this year.
   For the first half, Mr. Fisher said, Gap expects to report
earnings at least 35% higher than the 83 cents reported a
year earlier, on a 27% increase in sales to $807 million from
$636 million a year earlier.
   He said "our goals for the second half are more modest
than the first half" because of the uncertainty with the
economy. But he said Gap hopes to still outperform the
industry. Gap expects to operate roughly 1100 stores at
year-end compared with about 960 a year earlier; Mr. Fisher
said the company is considering additional expansion in
Europe and has been "looking around" in Japan.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Gap closed at $55.25, down 50 cents from Monday's
close.

   Duracell Holdings Corp., the battery producer taken
private in a June 1988 leveraged buy-out, reported earnings
of $6 million for the year ended June 30 compared with a
year-ago loss of $106 million.
   Operating cash flow -- earnings from operations plus
depreciation and amortization -- advanced 18% to $306 million
from $260 million. Duracell, based in Bethel, Conn., reported
sales climbed 6.8% to $1.33 billion from $1.25 billion.

   Duracell had been a part of Kraft Inc., which now is part

   Sales in the U.S, and Europe were particularly strong, and
consumers continue to move to alkaline batteries, Duracell's
specialty, from zinc-carbon batteries, a spokesman said.

   CHICAGO -- Whitman Corp. took its Hussmann Corp. unit off
the auction block after offers for the commercial
refrigerator manufacturing concern were judged inadequate.
   The consumer-products concern also said it will take a
special charge against earnings this year to reflect its
reorganization into an operating-company structure from a
holding company. It didn't say how large the charge will be.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Concerning Hussmann, James W. Cozad, chairman and chief
executive officer, said "the economic value of the company is
clearly greater than the price we were offered, so we have
withdrawn it from the market." Whitman's other units include
specialty food maker Pet Inc., a PepsiCola bottler and the
Midas International automotive service franchiser.
   Previously, Sanyo Electric Co., a Japan-based maker of
consumer electronics and appliances, was said to have
submitted the highest bid for St. Louis-based Hussmann. That
bid, which was between $500 million and $600 million, was
said to be below Whitman's expectations. However, Sanyo last
month denied it had submitted a formal offer.
   Whitman, adding that orders for Hussmann equipment have
reached record levels after a weak first half, said it will
seek "to realize Hussmann's improving potential as a Whitman
company." Hussmann has about 40% to 45% of the market for
refrigerators and refrigerated display cases for supermarkets
and about 25% of the market for such equipment used in
convenience stores. In 1989, it had a profit of $60 million
on revenue of $789 million.

   Tiffany &amp; Co. said its second-quarter earnings rose 27%,
boosted by a sales surge in international retail sales.
   The New York jewelry retailer said its second-quarter net
income rose to $7.1 million, or 45 cents a share, from $5.6
million, or 36 cents share, a year earlier. Sales rose 25% to
$107.3 million from $86 million a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Tiffany shares closed yesterday to $39.125, up $1.125.
   In a statement, Tiffany Chairman William R. Chaney
attributed the latest earnings increase to a surge in
international sales in both Asia and Europe, which "more than
compensated for the relatively low growth achieved by our
U.S. retail and direct-marketing businesses." He explained
that in the second quarter, Tiffany's international retail
sales rose 94% from a year earlier to $40.7 million, while
U.S. retail sales climbed only 2% to $50.7 million for the
same period.
   Tiffany also declared its quarterly dividend of seven
cents for each common share payable Oct. 10 to shareholders
of record on Sept. 20. Tiffany has 15.7 million common shares
outstanding.

   Pepsi Is Expected to Appoint Novak
   To the Company's Top Marketing Post

   Pepsi-Cola Co. is expected to name David Novak, the senior
marketing executive of PepsiCo Inc.'s Pizza Hut division, as
the top marketing official at the No. 2 soft-drink company.
   Mr. Novak will succeed Michael D. Simpson, a former
Kellogg Co. executive, who had been named Pepsi's executive
vice president, marketing and national sales, barely a year
ago. The brevity of Mr. Simpson's rein was unusual, but
apparently didn't reflect any major blunders on his part.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Novak, 37 years old, has been the major force behind
some of Pizza Hut's most effective marketing strategies in
recent years. He helped build the chain from a fledgling in
the fast-growing delivery business to a major player, despite
the dominance of Domino's Pizza Inc. in that area. He was
instrumental in the development of "Pizza Pairs," two pies
for a reduced price.
   He was also behind a recent marketing push to reach youth.
Some marketing experts, however, questioned the effectiveness
of Pizza Hut's current sponsorship of a concert tour of the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, given that the creatures have
been used in a host of endorsements in the past year.
   In confirming the management succession, which could be
announced today, a Pepsi spokesman said that 40-year-old Mr.
Simpson remains an executive vice president, but is now
responsible for customer relations on major fountain,
bottling and can accounts. The appointment is merely a
"reflection of an expanded focus to customer service," the
spokesman said.
   Mr. Simpson was instrumental in Pepsi's successful "cool
cans" promotion, the spokesman added. Under the promotion,
Pepsi lined grocery-store shelves with Pepsi cans with bright
graphics, including a surfer and a woman in sunglasses.
   Still, one industry executive familiar with Pepsi and Mr.
Simpson said the brief tenure reflects differences in
management styles. Mr. Simpson was "used to the consistent,
plodding pace of a company that introduces a new cereal every
two years," said the executive. "He didn't make any big
mistakes, but he just didn't make a dramatic mark on the
business."
   It is generally difficult to transfer marketers from more
conservative packaged goods companies to the fast-paced,
franchise-based soft-drink world, industry executives said.
Unlike many consumer-products companies, soda concerns must
rely on a complex web of franchised bottlers for
distribution. Also, compared to many kinds of consumer goods,
soft drinks are more sensitive to price fluctuations and are
pushed with advertising that is more heavily image-oriented.
"It's very tough for people to make the transition," between
the businesses, said Leenie Ruben, president of Marketing
Spectrum Inc., an Atlanta consulting company.
   Nonetheless, both Pepsi and Coca-Cola Co. had broken with
tradition in the past year and appointed outsiders into top
marketing jobs. In April, Coke's U.S. division named Theodore
J. Host as senior vice president, marketing. Mr. Host was
formerly an executive with Boyle-Midway Household Products
Inc., which makes Woolite, Easy Off and Black Flag. Industry
executives believe the soft-drink rivals were seeking to
breathe some fresh air into their promotional strategies, to
wrest market share from each other amid softer industry
growth.

   SAN FRANCISCO -- Bank of America said it led a 26-member
underwriting syndicate in the sale yesterday of a $4.1
billion issue of revenue anticipation notes for the state of
California.
   The state said it was the largest issue of its kind in
state history. Bank of America, a unit of BankAmerica Corp.,
added it was the largest such syndicate it ever led.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The notes, which mature on June 28, 1991, were sold at a
net interest of 6.05%, according to the California State
Treasurer's office. Proceeds of the issue are expected to
fund the state's cash-flow management program for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1991.
   Bank of America said the issue received a rating of MIG-1
from Moody's Investors Service Inc., and SP-1+ from Standard
&amp; Poor's Corp. Both represent the highest possible rating on
short-term municipal notes, the bank added.

   Canines Fight for `Asta' Role

   NEW YORK -- The noise of 104 dogs is a terrible thing.
   You hear them before you see them, the block-long chorus
line of yipping, yapping, yowling wire-haired terriers -- and
a few rogue beagles -- outside Manhattan's Roseland Ballroom.
Gracie, the first terrier in line, strains against her leash,
sniffing the air for fame as she might a raw bone, and then
throws up.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The canines came here yesterday to audition for the role
of Asta, in the upcoming $6 million Broadway musical "Nick
and Nora." If this couple sounds familiar, it's because they
first sashayed across the silver screen in 1933 in a hugely
successful adaption of Dashiell Hammett's book "The Thin
Man." The movie starred William Powell as Nick, Myrna Loy as
Nora -- and Skippy as Asta, their adorable sleuthing pup.
   When movie audiences first met gentleman detective Nick
Charles, he was shaking his fifth martini of the morning, his
heiress wife had a vicious hangover that prevented her from
decorating the family Christmas tree and Asta was attempting
to answer the telephone.
   These screwball touches, plus a couple of murders, a
frame-up and one bad dinner party, became elements of one of
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most lucrative franchises. Five more
"Thin Man" movies (and four more wire-haired terriers)
followed. A television series starred Peter Lawford. For a
brief period in the early 1940s, Asta became the most popular
dog's name in America.
   Annie McNiff-Burgess, a research scientist at State
University of New York at Stony Brook is anxiously holding
the leash of dog Number 90 (her audition position). She
thinks her Tisbet is ready to assume the Asta mantle.
   "He's a worker, he's a lover, he's my children," she says.
   Tisbet is also half-beagle, half-Corgi. No matter, Ms.
McNiff-Burgess says. "I wanted to give him his shot at 15
minutes of fame."
   Inside Roseland, it's pandemonium. Dogs are fighting, dogs
are howling, dogs are licking everything that moves. The
owners of three battling pooches yank them roughly by their
collars. One dog is lifted off the ground and hangs in the
air. The owners look agonized when they're spotted by Warren
Eckstein, the pet trainer casting the role.
   Michael Eubanks, a Fordham University student, tells
four-year-old Gizmo to "Sit." Six times. Gizmo doesn't sit.
   A day before the casting call, director and co-author
Arthur Laurents admitted that he didn't want Asta to be in
the show. Mr. Laurents, the co-writer of "West Side Story,"
says directing dogs is "a bloody pain in the neck."
   Tony-award-winner Joanna Gleason, who will star as Nora
Charles, is more forgiving. "{In the theater} they say beware
of children and dogs, and that's true to a certain extent.
But this is Asta." Nonetheless, when 27 terriers and the
silver-haired matrons who own them surround Ms. Gleason and
co-star Barry Bostwick for the first of many photo
opportunities, the two smile gamely but look slightly
unnerved.
   Beneath the marquee at Roseland, reporters and public
relations people outnumber the puppies. The PR types are
wearing name tags and carrying yellow dog bones. Two hours
into the daylong event, the reporters begin interviewing each
other. Seeing this, the head of PR offers various reporters
an exclusive interview with a woman wearing whiskers and a
tail who claims she didn't know the audition was for canines.
"In `Cats' they have people," she says defensively.
   The requirements for Asta are straightforward, according
to James Pentecost, co-producer. "He has to bark on cue every
time the phone rings or the doorbell rings," he says. Asta
must have teeth with "carrying ability." Age isn't a factor,
though, Mr. Pentecost adds, "the older we get, the harder it
is to train us."
   While the producers of the show won't discuss the lucky
canine's compensation, Mr. Eckstein says that his dog, Tige,
of Buster Brown &amp; Tige ad campaign fame, probably made more
than $150,000 in the 1970s. The new Asta has every chance of
scooping up product endorsements. Already the star-to-be is
scheduled to woof it up on the syndicated talk show "Live
with Regis and Kathy Lee."
   As the auditions move along at about 25 dogs per hour, the
crowd gets surly. Ms. McNiff-Burgess, Tisbet's mother, is
beginning to suspect it's fixed: "I don't want to be
paranoid, but I think there are professionals here."
   As she speaks, Rex, a wire-haired fox terrier, perks up up
his floppy ears on cue and widens his big brown eyes. Rex
gets a callback. His owner, New York insurance salesman Tony
Salerno, attests to Rex's amateur status, though the
auditions certainly didn't exclude the pros.
   New York artist John Bobbish isn't as successful with his
high-spirited three-year-old named Dudley. Mr. Bobbish,
wearing an orange Hawaiian-print shirt with bulldogs on it,
screams at the barking terrier to "shut up," then grins and
pats him on the head. He brought Dudley to the auditions, he
says, because "everybody kept telling me in different bars
that I should."
   Before his dog's audition, Mr. Bobbish offers passers-by
drawings of Dudley, adding that his "surreal circus
paintings" can be seen soon at New York's Vorpal Gallery.
They feature "you know, dogs, baboons, women," he says.
   Charles Suisman, the show's other co-producer, has
stressed to pet owners that "we're open to non-traditional
casting." But no Irish Wolfhounds or German Shepherds make
the cut.
   Two-year-old Coco, a dead ringer for the original Asta,
does get a callback. Her owner, Ethel Albujar, a retired cab
driver and New York City schoolteacher, thinks Coco has a
great shot. Mrs. Albujar adds, "She sleeps between me and my
husband. It doesn't make for a good love life, but we love
her anyway."
   In general, working with puppies is no picnic, says
Charles Strouse, the show's composer. He should know, having
worked with Broadway's most famous canine, "Sandy," in two of
his other shows, "Annie" and "Annie II." In the latter, he
notes, the dog that played Sandy was always scanning the
wings for his trainer and looking the wrong way. The show was
a flop.
   Whatever happened to the original Astas? Hollywood never
offered the wire-haired star a lucrative leading role in
action-adventure pictures; these went instead to rivals
Lassie and Rin-Tin-Tin. Asta was confined to brief cameos in
screwball comedies, working alongside stars like Katharine
Hepburn in "Bringing up Baby" and Cary Grant in "The Awful
Truth."
   But at least Asta's family members and namesakes benefited
from his legacy. Nikita Khrushchev, in a peace-offering to
President John F. Kennedy, once presented him with a
descendant of the Soviet space dog, Strelka. The puppy was
later mated with a cousin of one of the Astas.
   The star's name surfaced in politics again in November
1988, when then Vice President George Bush stopped at a
Westfield, N.J., home as part of a series of campaign visits
with average Americans. Asta, the family dog, was locked in
the bedroom.
   At the end of the auditions, nearly a hundred dogs have
called it a day. Only five potential superstars remain: Mr.
Smith, Hector, Ginger, Max and even a dog named Asta. The
role will be cast, and an understudy chosen, after more
auditions later this week.
   Mr. Strouse says he just hopes the terriers are trainable,
and can "sing." In a worst-case scenario, of course, the
dog's bark could simply be pre-recorded, he says. "But what's
happening to the theatre: both Madonna and Asta on tape?"

   Stage II Apparel Corp., a distributor of low-priced casual
clothing for men and boys, reported a second-quarter loss on
a plunge in sales, which the company blamed on the bankruptcy
court filing of Ames Department Stores Inc., a major
customer.
   New York-based Stage II reported a $750,000 loss, compared
with earnings of $379,000 in the second quarter of last year.
Sales dropped 24% to $15.4 million from $20.2 million in the
second quarter of 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Thomas Hammill, the company's controller, declined to
specify how much of the sales decline resulted from the
halting of shipments to Ames in the wake of its Chapter 11
filing. He added, however, that Stage II had resumed shipping
to Ames as part of the retailer's reorganization plan.
   "The financial results for the rest of this year will be
no worse than those of this quarter, and I am confident that
the company will return to profitability in the near future,"
said Stage II Chairman Jack Clark in a prepared statement.

   Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., the Hong-Kong based
investment company controlled by New Zealand investor Sir
Ronald Brierley, confirmed that it sold a stake of about 10%
in the French department store concern Societe Anonyme des
Galeries Lafayette.
   The French press has been speculating this week that
Industrial Equity had been the seller in a block transaction
which was performed by the brokerage DLP James Capel. An
Industrial Equity spokesman, reached by telephone in London,
refused to identify the buyer of the block, which he said was
sold late Friday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   According to the spokesman, the sale of the stake in
Galeries Lafayette was part of a "redeployment of resources"
within Industrial Equity's holdings. "We're actually quite
happy with the company, especially its development in the
U.S. It wasn't a change of perception of Lafayette, it was
more an internal decision," he explained.
   The spokesman declined to specify whether his company had
warned Lafayette Chairman Georges Meyer of the sale prior to
Friday's action. Mr. Meyer told French newspapers that he
hadn't been aware that the transaction would take place.
   However, the Industrial Equity spokesman said that "our
relationship {with Lafayette} has always been very cordial,
we have a tremendously high regard for them and we tried to
put them in the picture as much as we could."

   Henley Group Inc., seeking to streamline the company,
amended a previous plan to spin off two of its units and said
it will liquidate its stake in Itel Corp.
   At least a portion of Henley's 38.5% stake in Itel will be
bought back by Itel; the remaining shares will either be
purchased or underwritten by Itel, Henley said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The transaction, coming about two months after Henley
announced its decision to sell its Itel shares as part of a
liquidation plan, will net Henley about $375 million, all of
which will be used to pay down its $415 million in bank debt,
a company spokesman said.
   Itel is a Chicago-based leasing company. Henley is a
Hampton, N.H., industrial holding company.
   Henley, which has been reorganizing and spinning off
companies following its spinoff from Allied-Signal Corp. four
years ago, also modified a divestiture plan disclosed two
months ago. Under the latest plan, Henley said it won't spin
off its Pneumo Abex unit, as previously announced. The
company had said in June that it would distribute 35% of its
Pneumo Abex unit to shareholders. But Henley said it will
move forward with its plan to spin off its Fisher
International Inc. unit, although the Fisher spinoff plan no
longer includes two million shares of Itel that Henley was
going to pass on to the spun-off Fisher operation.

   Engineering Firm to Post

   The West German heavy engineering group Deutsche Babcock
AG expects to post an as yet unspecified pretax loss for its
fiscal year ending Sept. 30, after suffering a 15 million
mark ($9.5 million) loss in the six months ended April 30.
   "We have hard times ahead of us," Oberhausen-based
Babcock's new chairman Heyo Schmiedknecht said. At around the
start of fiscal 1990, Babcock had expected to post a pretax
profit of between 50 million and 70 million marks for the
full year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We must reckon on a clear pull-back of our financial
results," the 51-year-old executive said, adding that "we are
expecting a loss" before taxes for 1990.
   The company reported back in May that it suffered an
undisclosed pretax loss in the first five months of its
fiscal year and that it didn't expect a profit for the full
year.
   In fiscal 1989, Deutsche Babcock's net income fell 91% to
3.8 million marks from 40 million marks a year earlier. The
sharp decline prompted Babcock to omit its regular annual
cash dividend for fiscal 1989.

   First Executive Corp. reported a 40% drop in
second-quarter earnings and a sharp decline in assets that
may in part reflect substantial numbers of insurance policy
surrenders.
   The Los Angeles-based insurance holding company posted net
income of $30.5 million, or 10 cents a share, down from $51

amounts were computed on 84.7 million shares in the latest

   Revenue fell 23% to $440.7 million from $570.1 million.
   Policy holders in the first quarter redeemed a record
$1.33 billion of insurance policies and annuities. And, while
the amount of redemptions wasn't reported for the latest
quarter, First Executive's assets tumbled $1.53 billion in
the latest quarter, which may in part reflect policies being
turned in. Assets totaled $16.47 billion at June 30, down
from $18 billion at March 31 and $18.7 billion at June 30,
1989.

   NEW YORK -- The summer doldrums encumbered the bond market
yesterday as trading activity slowed to a trickle. Prices
ended mixed.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended about 1/4
point higher yesterday, a gain of about $2.50 for a bond with
a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction of its price, fell to 8.77% from 8.80% on
Monday.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Short-term securities, however, ended unchanged to as much
as 1/8 point lower. The yield on two-year notes rose to 7.93%
from 7.89% on Monday.
   But very little trading actually took place yesterday,
largely because several large bond dealers, so-called
interdealers, were still without operable equipment due to a
power outage in New York's financial district. Interdealer
brokers act as so-called "blind" brokers who buy and sell
bonds for securities firms and commercial banks.
   The lack of investor interest in bonds also contributed to
the market's muted tone.
   Michael Moore, head of government trading at Continental
Bank in Chicago, said that investors appear reluctant to
change their current investment positions due to numerous
economic uncertainties.
   "We're in a period of watching and waiting to see where
the Federal Reserve leads us," said Mr. Moore. He said that
while many investors believe that the Fed will eventually
ease credit conditions by cutting the federal funds rate from
its current 8% level, investors are less certain than they
were a week ago about the timing of such a move.
   Many investors, he said, had expected the Fed to ease next
week after its next Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
But now, he said, "we're seeing a change in attitude." The
change in expectations occurred yesterday morning after the
Department of Commerce released the retail sales report for
July.
   The government reported that retail sales in the month of
July grew 0.1%. Although that was considered very weak, the
market discounted the figure because of huge revisions made
to previous retail sales statistics. The government revised
the growth in June retail sales upward to 1.1% from an
earlier estimate of 0.5%.
   And after reviewing new data, the department said retail
sales slipped only 0.1% in May instead of the 0.6% it
estimated earlier.
   Bond investors interpreted the sharp revisions as an
indication that the economy hasn't been as weak as many
economists have suggested, and therefore, the Fed may be
under no urgent need to ease credit conditions.
   Bond prices were lower for much of the morning, but
switched directions and started rising in afternoon trading,
taking its cues from the futures market.
   Bond prices moved to the highs of the day following news
that Jordan's King Hussein and President Bush will meet in
Washington. The Jordanian king was said to be carrying a
letter from Iraq's Saddam Hussein, with whom he met Monday.
   The news "lifted investors' spirits and helped move
Treasury prices higher" as some people concluded that the
meeting would cool tensions between the U.S. and Iraq, said
Kevin Logan, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp. of New York.
   In the municipal bond market, new issue activity was
extremely busy as more than $4.7 billion in debt was priced.
   The bulk of the issuance was comprised of $4.1 billion of
California revenue anticipation notes priced by a group led
by Bank of America. The deal was the largest single issue
ever for the state. The notes, which are due June 28, 1991,
have a coupon rate of 6.25% to yield 5.80%.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury, Agency Securities
                                                                                                       

   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds ended at a price of
99 21/32, up from 99 13/32 on Monday. The latest two-year
notes ended at 100 3/32, down from 100 5/32 on Monday. The
yield on the two-year notes rose to 7.93% from 7.89%.
   Short-term rates moved higher. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.45% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.68%, while the rate on six-month
bills ended at 7.34% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.71%.
   In the agency market, the Federal Home Loan Banks issued
$565 million of three-year bonds priced at par to yield
8.18%. The bonds, which mature Aug. 25, 1993, will be sold
through the Office of Finance of the Federal Home Loan Banks.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate, Junk Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Junk bonds coasted as investors settled for another day of
lackluster summer trading.
   Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended unchanged.
   However, junk bonds of Duracell Holdings Corp. and AmBase
Corp. bucked the broader market trend and advanced.
   AmBase's 14.875% senior subordinated notes gained 1 point
to end at 95 after the company announced that it had signed a
letter of intent to sell its Home Insurance Co. unit to Vik
Brothers International, a European-based investor group.
   The company said proceeds from the sale, together with the
estimated proceeds from the sale $124 million par value of
Home Insurance's cumulative preferred owned by AmBase, will
be used to liquidate outstanding debt.
   Meanwhile, Duracell Holdings' 13.125% senior subordinated
notes ended 3/8 point higher at 103 1/2 after the company
reported strong earnings. Duracell reported net income of $6
million for fiscal 1990 compared with a loss of $106 million
in fiscal 1989.
   Meanwhile, junk bonds issued to finance real estate
developer's Donald Trump casinos weakened in the wake of the
New Jersey Casino Control's Commission's report on July
gaming revenues.
   The report, which provides a breakdown of revenues at each
of Trump's Atlantic City, N.J., casinos, was in line with
preliminary figures.
   Trump Plaza Funding Corp.'s 12.875% first mortgage bonds
shed 1/2 point to end at 70 while Trump Castle Funding
Corp.'s 13.75% first mortgage bonds slipped 1/2 point also to
end at 48 1/2.
   Trump Taj Mahal Funding Corp.'s 14% first mortgage bonds
also closed 1/2 point lower at 40.
   Activity in the junk bond market is expected to continue
at a slow pace today as many market participants will be away
attending Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.'s
two-day high-yield conference.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Japanese government bonds ended stronger, bolstered by
rising stock prices, a firmer yen and declining interest
rates.
   At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the price of
Japan's benchmark 10-year bond was quoted at 83.34, up 0.08
point, to yield 8.025%.
   After the exchange closed, rumors that the Finance
Ministry would buy bonds to support the market caused yields
on the benchmark bond to fall as low as 7.97% in
over-the-counter trading.
   In Europe, trading was quiet in most major markets as
investors and traders prepared for today's Assumption
holiday. Most European financial markets will be closed for
the holiday, with the exception of Britain.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds ended unchanged to 3/8 point higher in
extremely light dealings.
   Activity during the day focused on the heavy amount of new
issues.
   In secondary action, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 closed 3/8 higher at 98 3/8 to yield
7.32%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities closed with modest gains of up to 1/8
point.
   Among secondary issues, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% securities for August delivery were up 1/8
at 99 3/8, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% issues were
up 3/32 at 98 30/32 and Federal National Mortgage Association
9.5% issues closed up 3/32 at 99 15/32.
   Highlighting primary market activity was the release of
pricing details on a $1.05 billion Fannie Mae real estate
mortgage investment conduit issue, offered by First Boston
Corp.
   The offering is backed by Fannie Mae 9% securities.
   The Fannie Mae Remic had been underwritten earlier, but
details of the offering weren't unveiled publicly until this
morning.
   In the asset-backed sector, the next sizable issue awaited
is a three-year $1.25 billion Citicorp global deal
securitized with credit-card receivables.
   Officials at Citicorp weren't immediately available for
comment on the timing of the sale or spread talk on the
offering.

   Hanson PLC, Britain's largest industrial conglomerate,
reported a 26% rise in pretax profit in the nine months ended
June 30, helped by first-time contributions from Consolidated
Gold Fields.
   Pretax profit in the latest nine months rose to #939
million ($1.77 billion) from #742 million a year earlier. The
results were at the top end of expectations, which ranged
between #910 million and #940 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Profit after taxes but before extraordinary items totaled
#712 million, up 26% from #567 million in the year-earlier
period. Earnings per share rose to 14.6 pence, up 13% from
12.9 pence in the year-earlier period.
   Sales climbed 3.6% to #5.17 billion from #4.99 billion the
year earlier.
   Hanson's chairman, Lord Hanson, described the results as
very good in view of "the difficult conditions affecting some
sectors of our business" and said progress so far at the
company's U.K. and U.S. operations "allows us to be confident
about the balance of the financial year."
   Hanson didn't break out the size of the first-time
contribution from Consolidated Gold Fields, the British
mining and minerals group it acquired in August 1989. The
#3.5 billion takeover was Britain's largest ever.

   Southwest Gas Corp. posted a second-quarter net loss of
$6.1 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with net income
of $388,000, or less that one cent a share, a year ago.
   Revenue fell 6.4% to $171.7 million from $183.4 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Las Vegas, Nev.-based natural gas and financial
services concern attributed the net loss to increased costs
associated with providing gas service to the company's
growing customer base; increased depreciation expense and
general taxes relating to natural gas pipe replacement
programs in Arizona; and costs for expanding and upgrading
facilities.
   Gas operations had a loss of $8.5 million for the quarter,
compared with a loss of $3.1 million a year ago. Operating
earnings from the company's financial services subsidiary,
PriMerit Bank, fell to $3.4 million in the quarter from $4.5
million a year ago, beacuse of a drop in real estate
development income and increased general and administrative
expenses due to the expansion of PriMerit's branch network in
Nevada and Arizona. This was offset by improved net interest
margins, the company said.
   For the six months, net income fell 33% to $15.3 million,
or 74 cents a share, from $22.9 million, or $1.16 a share.
Revenue rose less than one percent to $445.3 million from
$441.7 million.

   Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc., the French pharmaceuticals
company, reported a net loss for the second quarter totaling
$178.1 million and a six-month loss of $185.8 million.
   The company's latest quarter and six months results
include operations of Rhone-Poulenc's human pharmaceutical
business since May 5, the date of change of control when
Rhone-Poulenc S.A. completed its tender offer for just over
50% of Rorer Group Inc.'s shares. The reported results prior
to May 1990 do not include any results from the human
pharmaceuticals business.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The quarterly and half-year losses include restructuring
and special charges of $262.4 million and $289.3 million for
the respective periods. These charges represent current and
future estimated one-time costs.
   The Department of Justice said last week that it would
seek to block a proposed strategic alliance between
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Failure to
complete the transaction in 1990 would result in about $30
million of lower pretax income as compared to previously
projected 1990 results, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer said.

   JORDAN'S KING IS EXPECTED to meet with Bush on the Mideast
crisis.
   The president is slated to meet tomorrow with King
Hussein, who is reportedly carrying a message from Iraq's
Saddam Hussein. While news of the Jordanian leader's visit
brought hope for a possible diplomatic solution, Bush said
the U.S. is ready to use its naval forces to shut down Iraqi
trade through Jordan. He added that the U.S. is still talking
to other nations, including the Soviet Union, to strengthen
such a move against Baghdad. The Soviets said they might join
a multinational force moving to block trade with Iraq if the
venture could be accomplished under U.N. control.
Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt called in the British,
French, Soviet and Chinese ambassadors in order to confer on
the proposal.

   Chiron Corp., marking its first profitable period ever,
posted second-quarter net income of $3.4 million, or 20 cents
a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $4.1 million,
or 30 cents a share.
   Buoyed by strong diagnostic business and increased product
sales, the Emeryville, Calif., biotechnology company's
revenue nearly doubled to $17.7 million from $9.2 million in
last year's second quarter. Chiron's bottom line also
benefited from the stabilization of research and development
expenses and other costs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For the six months, Chiron posted a narrowed loss of $1.2
million, or 8 cents a share, compared with a year-ago
sixmonth loss of nearly $9 million or 68 cents a share. The
1990 results include first-quarter charges of $9.8 million
for technology acquisition, and $1 million in costs for
postponement of a planned manufacturing facility, Chiron
said.
   Leading the company's turnaround was profit from its
diagnostics joint venture with the Ortho Diagnostics unit of
Johnson &amp; Johnson, the company said. Performance was also
buoyed by increased sales of Chiron's opthalmic products.

crisis.
   If the federal agency approves the surcharge, it would be

<TEXT>
   In a letter to its customers, CF Motor Freight said that,
if approved, the surcharge would initially add 1% to the cost
of shipments of less than a truckload, and 3.47% to
full-truckload shipments. They would change weekly, however,
based on the fluctuating cost of fuel.
   The surcharge is described as a straight pass-through of
increased costs, and it would be suspended when costs return
to normal, Consolidated Freightways said.

   PolyGram N.V. reported a 20% drop in first-half profit,
largely because of the costs of recent acquisitions.
   The recorded-music company, 80%-owned by N.V. Philips of
the Netherlands, said net totaled 118 million guilders (US$66
million), down from 148 million guilders a year earlier.
Earnings per share fell 26% to 69 Dutch cents from 93 cents,
reflecting an increase in the number of shares outstanding.
Sales jumped 25% to a record 2.18 billion guilders from 1.75
billion guilders.

   The decline in profit had been expected, and analysts have
predicted that the company will still report an increase in

an interview that results were in line with the company's
plan for the year and that prospects for record sales in the
second half look strong. He declined to forecast results.
   In the first half, PolyGram said it was hurt by a drop in
interest income to eight million guilders from 46 million
guilders a year earlier, reflecting acquisitions over the
past year of two record companies, Island International Ltd.
and A&amp;M Records Inc. In addition, PolyGram said, it had to
delay releases of new recordings as it created a new

   BP Says Output
   From Prudhoe Bay
   May Ease Shortage

   NEW YORK -- British Petroleum Co., the biggest producer in
Alaska's giant oilfields, said it could quickly boost its
output there as much as 10% to offset an oil shortage in the
U.S.
   In an interview, James Ross, chief exeuctive officer of BP
America Inc., said that as much as 200,000 barrels of
additional daily crude production might be squeezed from
Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the nation's biggest oilfield, and
nearby fields.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We have a little (room) to increase," Mr. Ross said. Such
increased Prudhoe Bay production could temporarily replace as
much as 25% of the oil the U.S. had been importing from Iraq
and Kuwait. The additional Alaskan production could come into
play in the fourth quarter, Mr. Ross indicated.
   BP made the calculations in response to an inquiry from
the Energy Department. Mr. Ross said the question was part of
a survey of major U.S. oil producers to ascertain how much
additional oil can be produced quickly from flagging U.S.
oilfields. Output from Prudhoe Bay began to decline last
year.
   Mr. Ross said that additional wells could quickly be
drilled into existing Alaskan oil reservoirs. But he warned
that sustaining such a high level of output for long could do
serious damage, including reducing the amount of oil
recoverable in the long run.
   In addition to sinking new wells, he said, if operators
are given permission by the state to burn off natural gas
that is normally produced along with oil, output from
existing wells could increase. Currently, operators are
required to reinject the gas underground to conserve that
natural resource. Mr. Ross said environmental restrictions on
such flaring would have to be waived.
   As for world-wide markets, Mr. Ross said he believes that
if only 50% of the four million barrels a day currently lost
from Iraq and Kuwait could be made up, supply disruptions
probably could be averted. He maintained that sufficient oil
inventory exists world-wide to meet needs through November if
that much additional production can be found.
   But he cautioned: "Any other shock to the supply system
would clearly throw us into a supply crisis."
   Mr. Ross said believes that Iraq may have more support in
the Arab world than is immediately apparent and thus is
bracing for a long stand-off in the Middle East. "Anyone
believing that this (crisis) will be over within the next
couple of months will be in for a considerable shock," Mr.
Ross predicted.
   He argued that the U.S. and other consuming nations must
be ready to head off supply shortages as fast as possible,
and noted that he and other industry executives are urging
Energy Department officials to prepare to activitate the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve quickly if the need arises.
   Mr. Ross said he recently unsuccessfully urged Henson
Moore, deputy energy secretary, at least to make the
necessary procedural preparations immediately. "By getting
the administrative machine ready, we would be prepared to
inject oil into the market overnight,"he said, adding: "Even
small quantities of the oil would have a calming effect on
the market."

   TORONTO -- Shares of Cineplex Odeon plunged 15% after the
company said it may not be able to complete the $31.8 million
sale of some of its U.S. theater assets to Plitt Amusement
Co. of Los Angeles.
   The transaction is one of several sales announced by the
troubled Toronto-based movie-theater exhibition chain as part
of a commitment to its bankers to raise net proceeds of $200
million through asset sales by the end of 1990. In the first
six months of 1990, Cineplex completed the ten asset sales,
for total gross proceeds of about $97 million. Two other
transactions, valued at about $76.8 million and including the
Plitt sale, are pending.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cineplex said the Plitt transaction, which was slated to
close July 31, has had its closing date extended to today to
allow the two parties to continue negotiations. But Cineplex
said in a release that "there is substantial uncertainty as
to whether the transaction will close" and that "to date . .
. negotiations have not been successful."
   Cineplex didn't give any reason for the uncertainty
surrounding the proposed sale and a spokeswoman declined to
elaborate. Individuals in the industry familiar with the
transaction said it apparently is foundering over financing.
   The sources said that, as part of a generally more
conservative approach to lending, banks seem to be unwilling
to finance an acquisition valued at more than six times cash
flow. The Plitt sale has an indicated value of eight times
cash flow, analysts said.
   Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Cineplex closed at $3.125, off 50 cents, on volume
of 317,900 shares.
   Lisbeth Barron, vice president, research, at S.G. Warburg
&amp; Co. in New York, said that while theater acquisitions at
eight times cash flow are being financed, "they have to be
really healthy chains in prime locations."
   Ms. Barron said she would find seven times cash flow a
fair value for the theaters Cineplex has agreed to sell to
Plitt, but added that the buyer's bankers may be using
financing as a negotiating tactic.
   "At the moment, no other buyer has emerged for those
assets," she said, adding: "When you're in Cineplex's place,
you don't have a lot of clout."
   Despite a market characterized by overcapacity, Allen
Karp, Cineplex's president and chief executive officer, has
said repeatedly that he isn't prepared to accept what he
calls "fire sale prices" for the company's theaters.
   If Cineplex doesn't meet the $200 million asset-sale
target set by its bankers, its two major shareholders, MCA
Inc. and Montreal's Bronfman family, have agreed to chip in a
total of $100 million to pay down debt. In April, Mr. Karp
said the company would have no difficulty reaching that
target.
   Cineplex plans to sell its interest in the 18-screen
Universal City Cinemas of Universal City, Calif., to an MCA
unit for $45 million, a sale that a Cineplex spokeswoman said
is still set to close by Sept. 30. "We don't expect {the
Plitt sale} to have any effect on that deal," she said.
   Cineplex said it plans to pursue "all available legal
remedies" against Plitt if the sale isn't completed.
   Plitt officials couldn't be reached for comment.
   On the stock market, news of the Plitt transaction
overshadowed the release by Cineplex of slightly more bullish
second-quarter earnings. While the company reported a net
loss of $38.4 million, or 81 cents a share, in the second
quarter of 1990, practically unchanged from $38.7 million, or
81 cents a share, the year before, admissions revenue rose as
did profit from operations before an $18.1 million charge
related to assets being held for disposal.
   Some analysts said "substantial" improvements in reducing
the company's debt and overhead have prompted them to
consider revising recommendations on the stock from a "sell"
to a "hold."
   "This is really very good progress, the turnaround is
coming," said Warburg's Ms. Barron.

   CHICAGO -- Eight publicly traded funds originally
sponsored by VMS Realty Partners stepped up their efforts to
wrest control of real estate properties from the troubled
partnership syndicator.
   Three of the mortgage funds said that they and the First
National Bank of Chicago had taken possession of 19 Los
Angeles area office buildings from VMS. The funds said that
as of June 30 they were owed $154 million on the properties
and that First Chicago, the senior lender, was owed $255.4
million.

<TEXT>
   The buildings, known collectively as the Buckeye
Portfolio, include addresses in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley, including several on
Wilshire Boulevard.
   The funds -- VMS Mortgage Investment Fund, VMS Mortgage
Investors L.P. II and VMS Mortgage Investors L.P. III -- said
the foreclosures took place after VMS filed bankruptcy-law
petitions on three groups of the buildings last week. Under
the settlement agreement, the funds allowed First Chicago to
take possession of properties that owed some $43 million to
the funds.
   A spokeswoman for First Chicago wouldn't comment on the
agreement.
   Previously, in two separate transactions three VMS funds
took possession of the Silver Sands Motel and a 55-acre
oceanfront development in Key Biscayne, Fla. The funds also
negotiated the removal of VMS as joint venture partner in a
downtown Chicago condominium development and in a suburban
Chicago townhouse project. VMS, which once claimed to control
a $9 billion real estate empire, raised $1.1 billion from the
public through the funds as a source of mortgage loans. The
funds severed all management ties to VMS earlier this year
and VMS said it is liquidating its operations. VMS spokesmen
couldn't be reached for comment.

   Economy:
   Vehicle Sales
   Dropped 18.5%
   In Early August

   DETROIT -- Sales of North American-built cars and trucks
dropped 18.5% in early August, reflecting economic
uncertainty more than an immediate consumer reaction to
tensions in the Persian Gulf.
   Auto company executives, dealers and industry analysts
said they have seen little effect so far from Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait, which caused gasoline prices to spike last week.
Instead, they said, consumers seem to be pulling in their
horns because of longer-term economic worries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I don't think people are going to stop buying cars
because of high fuel prices," said Chrysler Corp. Chairman
Lee A. Iacocca. "I think they are going to worry about their
jobs and the uncertainty {over} a recession that this Iraq
situation may bring upon us."
   The results from the Aug. 1-10 period this year stand in
sharp contrast to year-earlier sales, which were pumped up by
buyers taking advantage of huge rebates in order to avoid big
price increases on the coming 1990-model cars and trucks.
   Makers of domestic vehicles sold 246,772 cars and trucks
compared with 302,940 vehicles in early August last year. As
a result, car sales in the first 10 days of this month hit a
seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 6.6 million
vehicles, according to a Commerce Department formula. That is
far below the 8 million car sales-rate from a year earlier.
   Auto makers expected to see sales pick up in the second
half of this year after struggling through the first part of
1990 by dishing out huge incentives but getting only weak
sales in return. Now industry officials are expressing
pessimism about the rest of this year.
   Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile
Dealers Association, predicted seasonally adjusted annual
sales rates will come in closer to a meager 6 million cars in
the months ahead because of deteriorating consumer
confidence.
   "I hope there's not more than another two weeks {of weak
sales}, but that's living in hope," Mr. Iacocca said at a
ceremony for the start of 1991-model minivan production at
Chrysler's Windsor, Ontario, assembly plant. "It could last
six months."
   Chrysler's sales in the period were by far the worst of
the Big Three U.S. auto makers. Its domestic car sales fell a
steep 38.6%, while its domestic trucks were hurt by new
vehicles from competitors and slipped 22.5%.
   General Motors Corp. reported a sharp sales decline with
its domestic cars, off 22.2% as a result of weaker
performances from all five of its car divisions. Sales by
GM's Oldsmobile division, which have been deteriorating all
year, fell a steep 41.4% in early August. Cadillac sales,
meanwhile, dropped 41.6%.
   Even GM's imported car sales, which have been a source of
strength all year, plunged 39.7%. The No. 1 auto maker has
had trouble getting enough of the hot selling Isuzu-built Geo
Storm because of Japanese import-quota limitations.
   GM's domestic truck sales also suffered, falling 18.1%.
But Ford Motor Co., helped by the popularity of its Explorer
sport utility vehicle, saw its truck sales fall only 4%. The
news wasn't so good, though, for Ford's domestic car sales,
which dropped 21.3% in the period.
   Ford was hurt primarily because sales of the Escort
subcompact plunged 47.9% in early August. Sales of the
redesigned 1991 Escort, which came out earlier this year, and
the older version were off 21.8% for the whole year. Sales of
the Ford Thunderbird coupe dropped 47.9%, while the similar
Mercury Cougar saw its sales fall 50.3% in early August.
   The sales decline didn't leave Japanese auto makers
unscathed either. Honda Motor Co.'s domestic car sales
plummeted 15.4%, while Nissan Motor Co. car sales fell 33.1%.
Toyota Motor Co. showed a 64.3% improvement in domestic car
sales.

   AmBase to Sell Home Insurance Unit
   To European Investors for $544 Million

   NEW YORK -- AmBase Corp. agreed to sell its troubled Home
Insurance Co. property and casualty insurance company to Vik
Brothers International, a European-based investor group, for
$544 million.
   Under the agreement, which includes Home Insurance
subsidiaries Gruntal Financial Corp., Sterling Forest Corp.,
US International Re and Commonwealth Insurance Co., Vik
Brothers will also assume $76 million of AmBase's corporate
debt. The proposed deal leaves in place $285 million of
Series A cumulative preferred stock of Home Insurance.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The sale of Home Insurance, which had been on the block
since February, leaves AmBase essentially a thrift holding
company. In March, its board ousted Marshall Manley, one of
the insurance industry's highest-paid executives, as
president and chief executive officer. Mr. Manley had
embarked on an acquisition spree in 1985 in an effort to get
AmBase into a variety of financial services. But the strategy
didn't impress Wall Street; the company's stock price has
tumbled about 75% since 1986.
   By the time the deal is completed, AmBase's debt is
expected to stand at $730 million. The company said it will
use the proceeds from the sale to help pay off that debt.
AmBase will also sell in the open market preferred stock in
Home Insurance with a face value of $124 million, a company
spokesman said.
   Because both efforts to raise cash will fall short of
covering AmBase's indebtedness, it's not likely the company
will be able to distribute a special dividend it had
previously promised to shareholders.
   When the deal is completed, subject to completion of a due
diligence review by Vik Brothers, a definitive agreement and
regulatory approvals, AmBase's holdings will consist of
Carteret Bancorp. Carteret is a thrift institution based in
Morristown, N.J, with about $6 billion in assets.
   The sale of Home Insurance, which has annual revenue of
more than $2 billion, marks an inauspicious end to AmBase's
plan to build a financial superstore for consumers. A few
years ago, AmBase spent more than $400 million to add
Carteret and Gruntal, a securities firm. In its 1988 annual
report, the company's managers said they had created one of
the nation's top 20 financial services concerns.
   Since then, however, the company has been rattled by
earthquakes, junk-bond problems and bad loans to the
now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   George Scharffenberger, chairman and chief executive of
AmBase, said Vik Brothers was "committed to Home's strategic
direction and its current management team." Mr.
Scharffenberger added, "The purchase price paid by Vik
Brothers International reflects the tremendous improvement in
the underwriting operations of the Home Insurance Co. over
the past four years."
   Historically, Home Insurance has been a mediocre
performer, though in recent years AmBase has tried to revamp
its business and cut its exposure to natural disasters.
Although Home Insurance is still losing money on its
underwriting operations, its financial position has improved
somewhat.
   The insurance unit's combined ratio -- a common measure of
performance in the insurance industry calculated by adding
claims paid and expenses, then dividing by premiums paid by
policy holders -- had improved to 110.4 in the most recent
quarter, from about 135 in 1985, according to the company
spokesman.
   Separately, AmBase reported a net loss for the second
quarter of $106 million, or $3.12 a share. That compares with
net income of $30 million, or 90 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue fell 15% to $770 million from $911 million.
AmBase attributed the poor results to losses realized by the
high-yield portion of the investment portfolio of Home
Insurance.
   Vik Brothers' bid for Home Insurance is the latest
acquisition of a U.S. insurance company by a foreign buyer.
Earlier this month, Allianz AG of West Germany agreed to
acquire the Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. unit of Fund
American Cos. for $1.1 billion. In June, Dai-Ichi Mutual Life
Insurance Co. of Japan, agreed to pay $312 million for about
10% of Lincoln National Corp., a Fort Wayne, Ind., multiline
insurer.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AmBase shares closed at $7.50, up 12.5 cents.
   Vik Brothers officials weren't available for comment.

   GM Follows Ford by Boosting Car Prices,
   Creating Big Opportunity for Japanese

   DETROIT -- Despite a weakening economy and record market
share gains by Japanese auto makers, the two biggest U.S.
auto makers are raising prices aggressively in what could be
a boon for their Japanese rivals.
   General Motors Corp. yesterday released details of its
1991 pricing. Prices on most of GM's mainstream 1991 models
will rise 4% or more from year-earlier levels. The cheapest
1991 Chevrolet Lumina midsized sedan, for example, will start
at $12,870, up 4.3% from last fall. A Buick Century Limited
sedan will start at $14,795, up 5.1% from a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   GM's pricing follows the basic pattern outlined by Ford
Motor Co., which raised base prices on most of its 1991
models by 4% or 5%.
   In short, GM and Ford are hewing to the strategy they've
followed for the past two years: Raise prices aggressively,
then offer discounts if consumers balk.
   During the mid-1980s, a strong yen forced Japanese auto
makers to raise prices aggressively, giving Detroit a cushion
to boost its own prices. But with the yen now relatively weak
against the dollar, the latest round of domestic price
increases could give Japanese auto makers an opening to
reclaim the price advantage that they enjoyed during the
early 1980s.
   "The Japanese are adamant about further increasing their
market share in the U.S.," says Christopher Cedergren, an
analyst with J.D. Power &amp; Associates, a California market
research firm. "If the pricing advantage goes back in their
favor, all it does is throw more buyers their way," he says.
   Chrysler Corp. has said it wants to take a different tack
to combat the Japanese. The No. 3 auto maker has outlined a
strategy in which base prices of some 1991 Chrysler car
models will actually drop. However, Chrysler is raising
prices on its most profitable product, the minivan, by as
much as 12%.
   Chrysler officials say that by cutting prices on cars that
have sold poorly or face stiff competition, they hope to
avoid offering so much in the way of discounts.
   Big Three executives often speak of discounts, or
"incentives," as if they were a drug or a bad habit that the
industry needs to kick. Dealers complain that the myriad
incentive deals on the market now are confusing and turn off
customers.
   GM executives see it differently, however. "Buyers want a
deal," says a company spokesman. So this year, GM is raising
most base prices, but lowering the prices of certain
collections of options. This revives a complicated strategy
the company dropped last year. Here's how it works: A 1991
Pontiac Grand Prix sedan equipped with cruise control, power
windows, an AM/FM cassette stereo, four-speed automatic
transmission and several other options will list for $16,622.
That's $467 more than the same car today. However, GM says it
will knock $800 off the price of the 1991 car's optional
equipment. So the car's actual selling price is $15,822, $333
less than the same car a year ago, the spokesman says.
   There's a further complication, however. A 1991 Pontiac
Grand Prix doesn't come with a cash-back discount, at least
for now. GM is offering as much as $2,000 off the price of
1990 Grand Prix models.
   Consumers may find these discounts befuddling. But it's
clear that without these deals, which now average more than
$1,000 a vehicle, many Big Three models now would be
substantantially more expensive than their Japanese rivals.
This reflects, in large part, the fact that the best Japanese
car makers are able to build high-quality vehicles for
hundreds of dollars less than GM, Ford or Chrysler.
   During the mid-1980s, the rising value of the yen versus
the dollar masked this crucial Japanese advantage. Honda, for
example, raised the price of its Accord model by 14.3%, or
$1,326, between September 1985 and September 1986 largely
because of currency pressures, a company spokesman says.
   But this fall, Honda plans "minimal" price increases on
models such as the Accord and Civic that will carry over
essentially unchanged. Honda can do this in part because of
the weaker yen, but also because most Accords and Civics sold
here are built in Ohio, with labor and a majority of parts
purchased in the U.S.
   The danger to the Big Three is clear. Consider the
situation in the midpriced, family sedan market -- the heart
of the U.S. car business. The cheapest 1990 Honda Accord now
starts at $12,345. The least expensive Toyota Camry now
starts at $11,588. The cheapest 1991 Ford Taurus, however,
will start at $13,717 and have a less powerful standard
engine than either the Camry or the Accord. The cheapest 1991
Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme sedan will start at $15,095.
   "If the Japanese stand pat and don't raise prices that
much, you'll have a hell of a problem" in Detroit, says
Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst Joseph Phillippi.
   In fact, Detroit is already having a problem. The Honda
Accord is the best-selling car in the U.S. And led by Honda
and Toyota, Japanese auto makers commanded a record 28% of
the U.S. car market through the first six months of this
year.
   Consumers have demonstrated their aversion to stiff fall
price increases. Last fall, after the Big Three passed
through stiff price increases related in part to
government-required safety equipment, sales plunged. In
October and November, GM's market share dived below 32%, the
lowest level since the Depression.
   This year, the Big Three face the added risk of the U.S.
economy lapsing into a recession. "Incomes are slowing.
Interest rates haven't come down," says economist David
Littman, a vice president at Manufacturers National Bank in
Detroit.
   In this sluggish environment, he says, raising prices
could "arrest any improvement in market share."

   ATLANTA -- Turner Broadcasting System Inc. reported a
second-quarter loss of $8.3 million, or 13 cents a share, due
to a $31 million charge to cover losses from the Goodwill
Games.
   Last year, Turner Broadcasting had net income in the
second quarter of $5.5 million, and a loss of four cents a
share after paying preferred stock dividends.

   The large hit from the Goodwill Games, which brings Turner
Broadcasting's total loss from that event to $44 million,
casts doubt on the prospects of Turner Broadcasting
sponsoring a third self-styled Olympiad in 1994. Though its
chairman and chief executive officer, Ted Turner, said 11
days ago that he wants to back a third games in Leningrad,
the company's board, controlled by the nation's largest cable
operators, may veto the idea on financial grounds. The
company had set a goal of reducing the $26 million loss that
it suffered from the first Goodwill Games in Moscow in 1986.
   Despite the problems from the Goodwill Games, Turner
Broadcasting reported a 22% surge in revenue in the second
quarter from a year earlier, to $322.8 million from $264.5
million. The company attributed the revenue growth to a 24%
rise in revenue from its entertainment segment -- thanks
mostly to advertising and subscription gains from its Turner
Network Television network. Operating profit from
entertainment fell sharply because of the Goodwill Games
loss.
   From news, Turner Broadcasting's revenue climbed 13%,
while operating profit was flat.
   For the six months, Turner Broadcasting reported a loss of
$4 million, or 19 cents a share, compared with net income of
$5.1 million, and a loss of 12 cents a share after paying
preferred dividends, a year earlier. Revenue during the half
rose 24% to $613.6 million from $496.5 million.
