   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida Attorney General Robert A.
Butterworth is seeking details of a secret stock agreement
between Times Publishing Co. and a group including Texas
billionaire Robert M. Bass.
   Mr. Butterworth said he is concerned the agreement,
announced last week, may have harmful effects on the Poynter
Institute, a St. Petersburg educational foundation that owns
a majority stake in Times Publishing. And Mr. Butterworth, in
a letter to the institute, said he may take the matter to
court, if necessary.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the stock agreement, Times Publishing, the parent
company of the St. Petersburg Times, is to buy back a 40%
stake owned by the Bass group. The parties agreed not to
disclose certain terms of the transaction, including the
purchase price. As part of the accord, the Bass group also
agreed to drop a lawsuit seeking to force the redemption of a
preferred stock issue.
   However, the parties did disclose that under the pact,
preferred stock would be redeemed. And that's what concerns
Mr. Butterworth. He said the Poynter Institute petitioned his
office earlier this year for help in litigation, claiming
that any redemption of the preferred stock would severely
limit the institute's future charitable educational
activities. The Poynter Institute had been receiving
dividends from the preferred stock.
   In requesting additional information on the stock deal,
Mr. Butterworth's letter said, "In the absence of any
verifiable explanation to the contrary, the earlier
statements by the Institute . . . can only lead us to
conclude that the fiscal integrity of a charitable
educational institute is now in jeopardy."
   A spokesman for the Bass group hadn't any comment. A
prepared statement from Andrew Barnes, chairman of both Times
Publishing and the institute, said, "We are comfortable . . .
that the settlement is fair and assures significant on-going
financial support for the institute."

   Since Rudolph Flesch published his book "Why Johnny Can't
Read" in 1955, we have heard a lot about Johnny. . . . Not
only can Johnny not read, he also can't write. Johnny can't
spell, can't do arithmetic, can't tell you when the Civil War
was fought, can't distinguish the words of Stalin from
Churchill, and can't identify Central America, or his own
state for that matter, on a map. There's one other thing
Johnny can't do. Johnny can't fail.
   No matter how poorly Johnny has performed in school, our
benevolent, paternalistic educational system -- the perfect
analogue to our welfare system -- has by and large found a
way to promote Johnny to the next grade, found a way to keep
his self-esteem intact, lest he be disgruntled, discouraged,
or guilt-ridden.
   Johnny's deficiencies as a student can always be explained
away by reference to personal circumstances: poor school
lunches, budget cuts, biased testing procedures, a broken
home, racial or gender discrimination. (Well, in Johnny's
case, probably not gender discrimination.) And besides, his
underdeveloped skills or languishing motivation can always be
remediated or accommodated next year, on the next rung, by
the next teacher, in the next school, perhaps by diverting
him to some subject matter or vocational interest more to his
liking or aptitude -- a scheme that may well postpone
recognition of his failure indefinitely, possibly all the way
up to and including graduate school.
   For Johnny himself to fail -- as an individual and not
merely as a faceless, disadvantaged personification of some
larger subclass -- someone would have to be responsible. Some
parent, some teacher, some principal, some school board,
maybe even Johnny himself would have to become accountable
for that failure, would have to explain it to somebody; and
performance standards, objective criteria, would have to be
evoked to catalog the extent of the failure and the place to
begin to remediate Johnny.

   Vintners' Chief
   To Resign as Part
   Of Financing Plan

   NEW YORK -- Paul M. Schlem has agreed to step down as
chief executive of debt-strapped Vintners International Co.
as part of a refinancing plan offered by the wine maker's
lenders.
   If the plan is approved by the company's board in early
September, according to someone familiar with the
negotiations, Vintners will be granted a one-year moratorium
on interest payments on its $220 million debt, and additional
financing to carry the company through the fall grape
harvest. In exchange, the company will follow a "conservative
plan to downsize the company over the next 12 months."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Vintners -- which operates Paul Masson, Taylor California
Cellars, and Taylor Wine Co. of New York -- is the nation's
third-largest wine maker. According to one source familiar
with the company's finances, Vintners lost $20 million in its
last fiscal year, on sales of $250 million.
   Mr. Schlem, who took the company private in $240 million
leveraged buy-out from Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons in 1987,
would remain the company's chairman and largest shareholder,
according to another major stockholder. But day-to-day
managment of the company would fall to a three-man committee
made up of board members Edward McCray and Lee Dill, and
Frank Jerant, a production manager at the company's Paul
Masson vineyard.
   Bank of New England Corp., Harris Bankcorp., and Household
Commercial Financing Services, the three lenders, declined to
comment on the proposed deal. Vintners has gone in and out of
default on its loan, but its lenders haven't called the
loans.
   Both Mr. Schlem and Mr. Jerant declined comment. The two
board members couldn't be reached for comment.
   The company has been staggering under a debt-to-equity
ratio of 16 to 1, and has been "hemorrhaging money,"
according to Thomas Pirko, a beverage industry consultant who
has been following Vintners for Tokyo-based Bevmart.
   In July 1989, chief executive officer Michael Cliff, one
of the partners in the leveraged buy-out, was asked to step
aside by the company's board. Mr. Cliff and Mr. Schlem had
differed over the best approach to carry the company out of
its financial difficulties. Mr. Cliff had been trying to move
the company from its bedrock "jug-wine" market, which was
softening, into the import of premium wines, a rapidly
growing segment of the market.
   Mr. Schlem favored concentrating on the company's major
domestic brands, asserting that Mr. Cliff's plans had
inflated marketing costs from $12 million in fiscal 1987 to
$32 million in the fiscal year ending July 31, 1989.
   Mr. Cliff acknowledged Thursday that he and Mr. Schlem had
differed over long-term strategy. Mr. Cliff, who remains a
stockholder, declined to discuss the company's financial
problems since his departure.
   Roughly 25% of the company's middle -- and upper -- level
management have resigned or been dismissed since Mr. Cliff's
departure, according to a source familiar with the company's
operations.
   Mr. Schlem had hoped to raise about $100 million through a
sale of the company's Taylor Wine Co. of New York subsidiary,
but the best offer received for the unit was $40 million,
according to someone who looked at the unit for a potential
buyer. "Nobody would touch it at that {$100 million} price,"
he said. "And Schlem had to have the money to get through."
   Mr. Pirko, of Los Angeles-based Bevmart Inc., predicts
that if the current refinancing is approved, "it will only
temporarily stem the flow of blood. I think that without a
long-term capitalization and restructuring, the company
doesn't have a place in the major wine business.
   "What the company needs to compete against E&amp;J Gallo
Winery and Grand Metropolitan PLC, the number one and number
two players, is a major amount of capital to upgrade their
brands and to launch an importing business," he said.

   George Bush is earning well-deserved praise for his
handling of the crisis in the Persian Gulf. It will be an
unhappy paradox if he wins the war in the Gulf while
simultaneously losing the American economy. Yesterday in
Kennebunkport, the White House put out a statement that it
was monitoring the turmoil in the markets but had nothing in
mind to influence them right now. Today, however, Mr. Bush
will meet with his economic advisers, including Treasury
Secretary Brady, Chief of Staff Sununu and OMB chief Darman.
Whatever else this group may discuss, we hope it takes up the
possibility of President Bush applying to the economy the
quality he's brought to the Gulf -- leadership.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its remarkable
plunge yesterday, falling more than 75 points to finish below
2,500. Admittedly, there is little concrete action that a
President can take on short notice to turn around the sort of
financial debacle we witnessed this week. But the Bush team
ought to try to stand back a bit and recognize the
extraordinary amount of negative static in the market right
now, for which it bears some responsibility.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Middle East crisis, with oil prices running up over
$30, has no doubt rattled the market. But consider the
pre-existing status quo to which this crisis is merely an
appendage: a clearly floundering budget summit, the
expectation of new taxes of some sort, the possibility of a
stock-transfer tax, a Democratic leadership determined to
stop at all costs a cut in the capital-gains tax, an
administration lobbying for easier money and sniping at the
Federal Reserve's independence, the potential for
stagflation, the expected passage of a $30 billion-plus Clean
Air bill, a credit crunch driven in part by fears of
regulatory overkill and prosecutions.
   We suspect that what the market would most like to have
right now is reason to believe that the Bush administration
isn't abandoning it to this economic quagmire, while its time
and attention is consumed with Saddam Hussein. There are
indeed several things the White House could do to give the
economy a measure of much-needed confidence:
   Recognize and acknowledge that the budget-summit status
quo has been overtaken by events. There really is no time now
to play a drawn-out end-game over the budget with the
Democrats. With a changed set of circumstances, the emphasis
should shift away from recessionary tax increases and over to
the spending side, which now consumes real resources. The
stock-transfer tax, for instance, is a nutty idea. Why not
say so? The recurring White House statement that "everything
is on the table" is akin to saying that as-yet-unnamed
members of the economy are going to be taken out and shot. So
until then, everyone stops investing in the future.
   Reassert the Fed's independence. Up to now the point of
the Fed bashing has been easier money. But with the dollar
tumbling and inflation in the air, that policy is more
feckless than ever. It's time to help the markets believe
that the Fed will be allowed to conduct policy through the
Iraqi crisis without someone gnawing on its independence.
   Press hard for a capital-gains cut. Beyond the Senate
Majority Leader's coterie, the economic case for cutting
capital gains is pretty much settled. It's an economic
incentive to stimulate and reward investment. With the Fed
now obligated to focus on inflation, a capital-gains cut (if
necessary, coupled with a payroll-tax cut) is the one power
source available to jumpstart the economy. We suspect a
majority of Senators would still agree.
   Take steps to pump up domestic energy supply. Where the
law allows, President Bush should declare a national security
emergency to nullify prohibitions against drilling.
Restrictions on drilling off the coasts of California and
North Carolina are prime candidates. The Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge and Point Arguello off the Santa Barbara
coast are the country's most promising reserves.
   On balance, this has been a good few weeks for George
Bush. An administration, however, operates at its peril if it
fails to recognize that a market plunge the magnitude of this
week's is a sign its economic policy deserves some immediate
attention.

   George Melloan paints a distorted picture of the
exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System
(Global View, op-ed page, July 16). This mechanism makes many
European currencies artificially strong by tying them to the
deutsche mark. But Mr. Melloan states, "Strong currencies
have certainly done no harm to the industries of France, the
Netherlands, Ireland and Austria." As evidence, he cites
their impressive economic growth rates. He then argues that
Britain, which has remained outside the ERM, has no
compelling reason not to join: "If having a strong currency
did none of these countries any harm, what exactly is
England's problem?"
   The track record of strong-currency ERM nations is not as
nice as Mr. Melloan suggests. For example, the average annual
growth rate of the economy in France was lower from 1979-87
than for the pre-ERM years 1970-78. The same was true for
Italy. Evidence also suggests that the average rate of
unemployment in ERM countries has been higher and has
declined more slowly than in non-ERM countries.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Moreover, the clearest supposed benefit of ERM membership
-- price stability -- may not be so clear at all. While
inflation has been reduced dramatically in ERM nations, it
has fallen by a similar amount in the rest of the
industrialized world. Inflation rates in ERM nations are now
somewhat lower than in many non-ERM nations, but the
disinflation process was much slower for ERM members.
   Mr. Melloan concludes by wondering why Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher has been so reluctant to place the pound in
the ERM, ". . . what is England waiting for . . . given the
good track record of the other ERM nations? . . . Presumably,
Mrs. Thatcher knows the answer, but she isn't telling." Yet,
perhaps Mrs. Thatcher has been hesitant precisely because of
the track record of other ERM nations. Existing evidence
suggests that this reluctance merits praise, not derision.

   Reebok's Avia Unit
   Picks Mitsui &amp; Co.
   For Japan Market

   PORTLAND, Ore. -- Avia Group International Inc., a unit of
Reebok International Ltd., said it named Mitsui &amp; Co. as the
exclusive distributor of its athletic shoes and apparel in
Japan.
   Under terms of the agreement, the shoes, shirts, shorts
and other apparel items, will be marketed under the Avia name
by Mitsui, a $126 billion trading company that owns a number
of health clubs and markets lines of skis, golf clubs and
bowling equipment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mitsui will market Avia's products through its Bussan
Sports Academy subsidiary.
   Approximately $9 million of Avia's $200 million in sales
last year came from Japan, analysts said. Backed by the name
of a big Japanese firm, Avia's Japan sales are expected to
grow by about 50% each year, reaching about $30 million in
three years, analysts estimate.
   Avia is also negotiating deals with Yugoslavia and
Czechoslovakia, said Harry de Boer, Avia's international vice
president. Agreements are expected to be signed soon. Avia's
international division, which last year had sales of $35
million, is expecting growth of about 40% this year, and
better than 50% in each of the next two years, Mr. de Boer
added. Currently, it does 75% of its business in Canada, the
U.K., Germany and Spain.
   Avia's international growth comes at a time of
retrenchment in its domestic division. The company's overall
sales last year of about $200 million were flat, though at
one time it had visions of selling $250 million of products.
   Avia shoes sell on the higher end of the retail scale --
between $50 and $90 a pair. Competition in that league is
stiff, especially since it must rival companies, including
its parent Reebok, that have advertising budgets two to three
times in size. Avia spent about $20 million in advertising
and promotions in 1989.
   As a result, the company has scaled back its overall
growth expectations for the next couple of years, taking the
time to reposition itself on the marketing front. For
example, next year it will stop making sneakers for tiny tots
and younger children, focusing instead on making greater

   TORONTO -- Imperial Oil Ltd., 70%-owned by Exxon Corp.,
said it is seeking a buyer for a coal mine near Sparwood,
British Columbia.
   The mine produces about 1.6 million metric tons of coal
annually and has annual revenue of 50 million to 100 million
Canadian dollars (US$44 million to US$88 million), a
spokesman said. A metric ton is about 2,204.62 pounds.

   Orders in July
   Climbed 2.9%

   But Demand for Such Items
   Is Up Very Little During
   Past Year, Figures Show

   WASHINGTON -- New orders for durable goods in July
rebounded from a big decline the prior month, but demand for
the big-ticket items has barely grown over the past year, the
Commerce Department reported.
   U.S. factories received $128.3 billion of orders for
durable goods last month, a 2.9% increase from June, when
orders fell 3.2%, the department said. Most major categories
-- primary metals, machinery, transportation equipment and
capital goods -- increased in July after declining the month
before. Orders for transportation equipment, particularly
aircraft, showed the strongest gains last month, jumping 5%
after tumbling 6.3% in June.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Durable goods, generally defined as products expected to
last at least three years, range from cars and home
appliances to computers, factory equipment and sheet metal.
Economists consider demand for such items a good barometer of
the economy's health.
   Although analysts were pleased by the across-the-board
improvements in durable-goods bookings last month, most found
little evidence that manufacturing is rebounding from its
stagnation of the past year. At the end of July, orders stood
only 1.5% above their monthly total a year earlier, according
to the report. Since the beginning of this year, orders have
fallen in three months and risen in four, leaving the overall
total practically flat since January.
   "The individual components in July are generally
encouraging, but this report is generally quite volatile so
you should discount the strength," said Alan Gayle, chief
economist at Crestar Financial Corp. in Richmond, Va.
   Moreover, economists were reluctant to place too much
significance on the July figures, given the new uncertainty
in the economy after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, sending oil
prices spiraling.
   "These decisions were made to place orders well in advance
of developments in the Middle East," said Nicholas Perna,
chief economist at Shawmut National Corp. in Boston. "That
means the numbers are essentially borderline irrelevant."
   He continued: "The real question is what are orders going
to look like if people become convinced that oil is at $30 a
barrel and rising, and the threat of recession is becoming
precipitous."
   Defense capital goods was the only category to show a
decline in orders last month, posting a 3.1% decline on top
of a 21.9% plunge in June. Non-defense capital goods orders,
a good indicator of business investment plans, grew 10.7%,
but economists worried that companies' jitters over the
economy in light of the Middle East crisis will lead them to
scale back capital-spending plans.
   Orders for primary metals grew 1.5%, orders for
nonelectrical machinery -- a category that includes computers
-- rose 2.7%. Electrical machinery orders increased 1.9%.
   Unfilled orders grew 0.7% but shipments fell 2%.
   All the numbers were adjusted for normal seasonal
variations.

   Emerging Yuppies
   Find That It's Hard
   To Be Cool in Siberia

   Still Scarce at Any Price,
   What's the Use of Money?

   SURGUT, U.S.S.R. -- Sergei Telkov and Alexei Suchkov are
27-year-old masters of the art of survival here in deepest
Siberia.
   They wear Italian clothes with designer labels, watch
American pop-music videos on their Japanese television sets
and drive around the potholed streets of Surgut in gleaming
new cars. They work off their stress at a gym in the morning
before heading to the office. Back home in the evening, they
sit around munching American chicken legs, wondering how to
spend all the cash they earn.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "How much does a big Mercedes cost in the West?" Mr.
Telkov asks over dinner one day, lighting up an American
cigarette and pouring his wife another glass of Bulgarian
Riesling.
   Yuppies have made it to Siberia. It has taken hard work
and a lot of hassle, but Messrs. Telkov and Suchkov are among
the first of a new generation of upwardly mobile
professionals to take root amid the taiga and tundra. Like
their counterparts in Manhattan or London, they are deeply
conscious of money and status. They spend hours hunting for
goods with the right labels. They even fret about taxes and
real estate.
   In a place better known for its freezing winters and
Stalin-era prison camps, however, it comes as little surprise
that the Siberian breed has some distinct peculiarities. They
have to make do with a bright yellow soda called Tarkhyn,
which tastes like mouthwash, because Perrier hasn't made it
out here. Even the best restaurants offer only greasy potato
soup as their special, and meat is hard to find -- let alone
cellular telephones or laptop computers.
   Their biggest struggle, though, is trying to have a bit of
class in a society that long claimed to be classless.
   They support their extravagant life style with revenues
from the Soyuz construction and interior decorating company
that Mr. Suchkov founded less than two years ago. Surgut, a
joyless concrete jungle built on a swamp by the river Ob, is
a big center for the Soviet oil and gas industry. As the two
are finding, anyone who can put up buildings and redo
interiors faster and better than state organizations is bound
to make a fortune.
   Messrs. Suchkov and Telkov are the sort of people Mikhail
Gorbachev needs as he tries to steer the Soviet Union toward
a market economy. Private property still isn't legal in the
Soviet Union, but Mr. Gorbachev has allowed cooperatives, so
that's how the firm was founded. That means the local town
council could theoretically close it down any time, as has
happened to cooperatives elsewhere. Fortunately, the new head
of the council is an old colleague of Mr. Suchkov.
   The handiwork of Messrs. Suchkov and Telkov can be found
all over town. Inside dormitory No. 10, a drab concrete block
that houses 300 oil workers, Soyuz has painted exotic
landscapes on the replastered walls. Director Maria Gorobets
sits in the ground-floor library, which has been made to look
like the interior of a medieval castle, complete with fake
brick fireplace, and gushes about their work. "They have so
much fantasy," she says. "It's really unusual."
   Most of their other jobs, including a new brick plant and
a concrete office block for the state-owned oil company, are
less inspiring. But they provide solid income for Soyuz's
canny management, which uses all the tricks it can.
   For instance, Soyuz has allied itself with the Surgut
chapter of the Young Communist League. Although Soyuz's
directors are downright disdainful of communism, the link
gives them a hefty tax break under Soviet rules. The league
has a special tax status similar to that of charities in the
U.S. Instead of paying the state corporate taxes of 45% of
its profits, the cooperative just pays 15% to the league.
   Last year, the cooperative's revenues were about 1.7
million rubles, or $2.7 million. After paying for materials
and the wages of their 30 full-time workers, Messrs. Suchkov
and Telkov and a third director were left with about 50,000
rubles ($80,000) income apiece, plus a substantial sum that
they plowed back into the company. With the average national
wage here less than 3,000 rubles ($4,800) per year, that
makes them the Soviet equivalent of the Sultan of Brunei.
   Despite the support and contracts they receive from local
authorities, not everyone is happy about their hefty income.
The local bank, for one, tends to scrutinize their accounts
to check for any evidence of bribery. Soyuz dismisses the
charge as envious nonsense.
   And the two entrepreneurs are less than enthusiastic about
a new personal-income-tax law. "I work hard because I want to
live well, but hard work is starting to lose its sense," Mr.
Suchkov grumbles.
   Under the new law, he faces steep progressive tax rates
for anything he earns over 700 rubles ($1,100) per month. "If
we didn't have a problem with taxes, we could build a big
firm," he says. "But as soon as you start earning more than
Gorbachev, people start complaining."
   Taxes, however, are nothing compared with the everyday
hassles of keeping the firm running smoothly in a nation
plagued by shortages of everyday goods.
   One morning, Mr. Telkov drives to a crumbling blue
building. Inside, next to the Aeroflot office, is one of
their latest projects: a hairdressing salon. They rented a
tiny room from Aeroflot, put in running water and painted the
place in warm yellow and brown tones. On each wall is their
trademark, a fleur-de-lis between two lighted candles.
   "Baroque," says Mr. Telkov.
   "Rococo," Mr. Suchkov corrects him.
   Finding staff was no problem: They simply approached four
of the best hairdressers in the area and offered to triple
their salaries.
   But where to get supplies? A relative who was recently in
Canada brought back some curling tongs, an electric
hair-dryer and a few complimentary bottles of Holiday Inn
shampoo. After that, they were on their own.
   Mr. Telkov went to the Svoboda factory in Moscow, the
nation's biggest producer of soap and shampoo. It refused to
sell supplies to cooperatives on principle. Because the Soyuz
salon charges the same for its services as state-run
competitors, local distributors are supposed to provide them
with some materials. That, at least, is the theory.
   To grease the wheels, they do small favors for their
competitors in the state sector who have access to government
supplies. In one case, a state hair salon wanted new orange
polka-dot overalls for its staff like the ones the
cooperative uses. The two obliged by going to their source in
far-away Tyumen for the material, in exchange for shampoo and
other supplies. "It's a long chain," Mr. Suchkov says.
   Pampering themselves is easier than finding shampoo for
their company. There are plenty of gyms, built for the oil
workers; the Soyuz cooperative rents one four mornings a
week. And for some reason that nobody could explain, lots of
American chicken legs started appearing in Surgut's stores
recently.
   Even in Siberia, money talks. But since anything worth
buying is only on sale on the black market, consumerism can
get pretty expensive.
   They bought their Japanese TV sets and video recorders in
Moscow for a staggering 15,000 rubles, the equivalent of
$24,000. Prerecorded tapes go for about 150 rubles ($240). On
the edge of the Surgut farmer's market every Sunday, people
sell jeans for 350 rubles ($560). But that's too cheap for
Messrs. Suchkov and Telkov, who have known each other since
they studied together at a Tyumen Building Institute in the
early 1980s. They have developed a taste for Italian and
French linen trousers with designer labels that go for about
600 rubles ($1,000).
   "It's so hard to find good children's clothes," says Mr.
Suchkov's wife, Yelena, taking another bite of American
chicken. Still, their four-year-old daughter Anna is neatly
turned out in a T-shirt which reads "Lambada" and a denim
skirt.
   There are still some things that money can't buy. Mr.
Telkov, who is wearing a green "International Golf and
Country Club" shirt, talks about how he and his wife Galina
want to move out of their cramped apartment on the edge of
town. But all apartments are state-owned, and can't be bought
or sold. "We need private property," he grouses.
   And then there are those annoying little things that would
irritate yuppies anywhere. The two couples recently went to
the Black Sea to work up a tan before their vacation in
Yugoslavia later this year.
   "There are no decent restaurants in Sochi," Mr. Suchkov
complains. "You even have to bribe the waiter to serve you
champagne."

   Michael Moschen: The `Genius' Juggler
   ----

   New York -- Among the herd of poets, choreographers,
scientists and scholars nominated for so-called MacArthur
"genius" awards this year, one name stood out. "When the
committee saw a paper file on a man named Michael Moschen who
was a juggler, eyebrows were raised," said Kenneth W. Hope.
Mr. Hope oversees the Fellows Program of the John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which recently presented
36 "exceptionally gifted individuals" with cash awards
ranging from $150,000 to $375,000.
   Mr. Moschen is the first MacArthur juggler, a fact that
still seems to bemuse Mr. Hope. "Juggling," he said, "while
it's a very ancient and traditional art form, is not
something one thinks of when one thinks of creativity."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But Mr. Moschen, a wiry 35-year-old with thinning curly
hair and a surname made to delight waggish copywriters, is
not your traditional juggler. You won't see any bowling pins
in his act, and he doesn't juggle lit torches (he prefers to
spin his, a rhythmic gymnastics technique). And while some
jugglers may start off with four balls and add on seven
oranges, a bicycle wheel and an umbrella, Mr. Moschen is more
likely to start with four balls and end up with just one. His
Zen approach to juggling makes the business of tossing
objects in the air and catching them look like a whole new
ball game.
   "For me, a juggler is very simply about control -- but a
control to protect us against what?" Mr. Moschen paused.
"Chaos."
   On stage, he creates the illusion of a geometrically
ordered universe in which balls, hoops, tetrahedrons and
other shapes seem to propel themselves through space. Four
crystal balls revolving on the floor suddenly lift themselves
into Mr. Moschen's hands and form a swirling chain. A single
metal ring wafts before him, then sweeps through the air
making slinky-like patterns of light; a pliant, rubbery hoop
melts into one Daliesque shape after another as it turns in
his hands.
   However esoteric the philosophy behind Mr. Moschen's
performances, the effect on audiences is mesmerizing. The
crowd of cellular-phone-equipped Manhattanites that came to
see him perform recently at Lincoln Center's "Serious Fun]"
festival gawped like kids at the circus. Apparently, one look
at a videotape of Mr. Moschen's act had MacArthur committee
members doing the same -- they voted to award him $230,000
over the next five years.
   The award came just in time for Mr. Moschen, whose checks
were about to bounce even faster than his rubber balls.
   "I was not going to be able to hold out much longer within
the arts and pay the bills and do the work I needed to do
unless something gave," he said, leaning back on a desk chair
in the crowded Bowery loft he shares with his wife, Danielle
Mailer, a painter and graphic designer, and their
14-month-old daughter, Isabella. Most of the available space
is taken up by the long carpeted platform where he has
developed his routines before a wall-length mirror since
1977.
   A teenage jock from Greenfield, Mass., Mr. Moschen was
more interested in football and basketball than juggling,
which he learned at the age of 12. But after being hit so
hard playing football that he briefly lost his memory, he
began juggling in earnest.
   By the age of 19, Mr. Moschen and boyhood friend Penn
Jillette, now of Penn and Teller fame, were tossing clubs six
times a day, six days a week, at New Jersey's Great Adventure
amusement park. College didn't interest him: "I very early
dropped out of the normal routes of higher education because
it wasn't teaching me how to teach myself," he explained.
   In 1981, after stints as a street performer, a juggler
with the Big Apple Circus and a dancer/juggler with Lotte
Goslar's Pantomime Circus, Mr. Moschen struck out on his own.
Dissatisfied with circus-style juggling, he was looking for a
new way to develop his craft when he spied a crystal ball in
an antique shop.
   "I was trying to figure out how to work with absolute
simplicity," he said. "I didn't know if a juggler could work
with just one small thing and make it interesting."
   "Crystals," which Mr. Moschen performed at Lincoln Center,
dressed only in a loin cloth, began with the juggler on the
ground, curled over a clicking circle of clear balls. Cupping
the spinning balls in his hands, he slowly released one after
another till a single crystal revolved in his palm, flipped
over and under it and glided over his hands and arms as
though animated by an energy of its own.
   To create such arresting images, Mr. Moschen will spend
months, even years, experimenting with an object or shape.
Like a sculptor, he makes drawings, photo studies and models.
While deep in his circle phase on a stay in Cape Cod, for
example, he attached a metal ring to a pole and then stuck it
in the sand at low tide. When the tide came in, the ring
seemed to float above the waves, an image he determined to
re-create in performance.
   Inspiration often comes from unlikely places. Take Mr.
Moschen's triangle piece, in which he bounces three balls off
the sides of a tall pyramid in rapid-fire rhythms that change
as much as 20 times.
   "I became fascinated with the wedges you put under a door
to stop it," he said.
   Over the next year, he experimented with small hollow
wedges before building a big one with the help of set
designer John Kahn, a frequent collaborator. Soon Mr. Moschen
was spending the better part of his 12-hour workday inside
the triangle.
   "I would lie down in it, roll balls while I was lying down
in it, do handstands in it -- I'd climb on top of it," Mr.
Moschen said. "For a year and a half I lived inside the
triangle to make it mine. Sometimes I'd go to sleep inside
the triangle because you can't know it well enough."
   Mr. Moschen performs such routines with a physical grace
and precision that sometimes seems closer to dance than
juggling. But while he may be the only juggler to work with a
choreographer and receive choreography grants, he resists the
label.
   "Dancers and choreographers have used objects, but always
I felt they were separate from them," Mr. Moschen said. "You
can't really separate me from what I'm doing if I'm doing it
well."
   Viewers will have a chance to check out Mr. Moschen's act
for themselves next spring, when a broadcast of his work will
air on PBS's "Great Performances" series. In the meantime, he
intends to explore the role of the juggler "as architect."
He's been experimenting with columns, cones, and even his
wife's drawing table. So far, there isn't a bowling pin in
sight.

   The first set of commandments to be issued from the Middle
East comprised 10 items. T.E. Lawrence settled on no fewer
than 27.
   Lawrence of Arabia, as he is known to video-store owners
if not to historians, urged Englishmen plunging into the
business of the region to speak tribal dialects of Arabic, to
avoid being "too intimate, too prominent or too earnest," to
"cling tight to your sense of humor" and to "let it be
clearly known that you are a British officer and a
Christian." And, of course, a helpful word about fashion: "If
you wear Arab things, wear the best."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   All sensible advice, of course, for Lawrence of Arabia was
a sensible, not to say sensitive, man, far deeper than the
image that has been passed down to us in an era when the
region has been shorn of its romance and when colonial
meddling has been discredited in polite society.
   In "Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorized Biography of T.E.
Lawrence" (Atheneum, 1,188 pages, $35), Jeremy Wilson argues
that Lawrence was a figure of substantial diplomatic and
literary achievement, a man who reshaped the Middle East in
the dust of battle and, later, in the polished salons of
diplomacy. His "Seven Pillars of Wisdom" sold more than a
million copies; his translation of the Odyssey is still
available. All that and a figure of mystery and legend]
"Public enthusiasm for media idols is usually short-lived,"
Mr. Wilson writes, "but in Lawrence's case it has endured for
more than 65 years."
   Mr. Wilson is not, of course, the first to bury himself in
the life of T.E. Lawrence. He was preceded by a remarkable
constellation of literary stars, among them Robert Graves,
Andre Malraux, Liddell Hart and Lowell Thomas, who played a
major role in the myth-making in the first place. Mr. Wilson
himself spent a decade sifting through letters, telegrams and
documents. The result is a narrative taking the reader from
Lawrence's birth in Wales and his rearing in Scotland,
Jersey, Brittany and England to his archaeological trips to
Carchemish, his work in the Arab Revolt and his activities in
the Colonial Office, all the way to his death in a traffic
accident in 1935.
   As a university student Lawrence once worked 45
consecutive hours, a kind of Oxonian Outward Bound designed
to test his endurance. Indeed, his form master in school in
1901 had noted that the young Lawrence was, "unlike the boys
of his age and time" and was possessed of "an apparent
indifference toward pleasure or pain." He also was different
in that, before he was 10, he was aware of his own
illegitimacy -- a fact that Mr. Wilson gives great
importance. "As a result," Mr. Wilson says, "he would have to
build up his own identity and self-esteem through personal
achievement and moral integrity."
   But this is no psychobio piled deep with babble; if
anything Mr. Wilson errs on the side of prim historical
practice, piling detail on detail, digressing to provide
background and to steer the reader through some of the feuds,
rivalries, land claims and religious zealotries that make
Middle Eastern history such forbidding territory.
   Along with the story of Lawrence, Mr. Wilson provides
insights into the underpinnings of British foreign policy
during the World War I period and shortly thereafter,
especially the delicate balancing act required by a country
that nurtured native nationalist movements in the Middle East
while resisting them in India.
   Mr. Wilson portrays Lawrence as something of a
partisan-in-residence in the British intelligence operation
before becoming a player in the Arab revolt itself. On his
first military operation, he executed a Moroccan who had
committed a murder. Soon he was ambushing railways and
cutting telegraph wires. He encountered boils, high fevers
and buffeting by "a breathless wind, with the furnace taste."
The Turks put a #20,000 price on his head.
   Col. Cyril Wilson, British representative in Jidda,
thought him "a bumptious young ass." Churchill thought of
Lawrence as "someone strangely enfranchised, untamed,
untrammeled by convention, moving independently of the
ordinary currents of human action." But Mr. Wilson defends
his man's "remarkable grasp of the political and military
situation."
   Lawrence spent years brooding over his books, the
immorality of the war years and his lack of sexuality, all
the time seeking anonymity far from the madding crowd. Mr.
Wilson argues that Lawrence had a "deep revulsion" toward sex
of any sort. He tells us that Lawrence hid in the barracks as
an aircraftman, tested a new line of high-speed military
boats and wrote reams of letters to George Bernard Shaw and
his wife. Some thought him a self-promoter, some a spy. He
thought he was a great writer. I hope "I shall be appraised
rather as a man of letters than as a man of action," he wrote
Robert Graves.
   A vain hope, in all probability. But in a book too long
about a life too short, Mr. Wilson portrays him as both. Even
Lawrence of Arabia wouldn't quibble with that.

   TOKYO -- Two Japanese companies, the trading concern C.
Itoh &amp; Co. and the chemical plant engineering firm Chisso
Engineering Co., received an order valued at about 2.3
billion yen ($15.7 million) from Slovnaft State Enterprise of
Czechoslovakia to build a chemical plant in Bratislava,
officials of the companies said.
   Itoh and Chisso said the plant, to be completed in the
beginning of 1992, will produce isoparaffin, an additive for
use in unleaded, high-octane gasoline. With the new plant,
officials said, Czechoslovakia is expected to switch as much
as 60% of its domestic demand to unleaded gasoline from heavy
dependence on leaded gas.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Coinciding with a move in Europe to prevent environmental
pollution, as well as with Czechoslovakia's auto production
project, the new plant will process 250,000 metric tons of
isoparaffin annually. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62
pounds.

   DETROIT -- Anyone who dreams of tooling along America's
roads in a slick Ferrari Daytona Spyder needs two things:
money and patience. The now-discontinued car fetches roughly
$1 million, and there's often a lengthy wait to get a used
one.
   But buyers who settle for a California Daytona Spyder have
no wait and pay only about $50,000. The California Spyder is
a "kit car," a life-size replica that independent
manufacturers make from the parts of cheaper cars. The
California Spyder looks so much like the Daytona Spyder it
was used on television's "Miami Vice." It's also so close to
the original version that Ferrari S.p.A. sued its builder for
trademark infringement -- and won.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The $300 million kit-car industry has been on edge since
that July 1989 ruling by a federal judge in California, and
with good reason. Other luxury car makers are joining Ferrari
in claiming that kit-car makers are cheating them by
reproducing their cars and selling them at cut-rate prices.
   The auto companies claim the kit-car makers are infringing
on their trademarks, because their designs are easily
recognized and considered unique. "We don't want a
Chevy-powered Lamborghini on the road," says Robert F. Smith,
business development executive for the U.S. sales arm of
Lamborghini S.p.A. "We're trying to protect our reputation."
   That wasn't much of a concern until the last year or two.
Most kit-cars (so-called because consumers can buy them in
kits to build at home, though most buy them already
assembled) didn't look too much like the originals. But many
kit makers have improved their manufacturing processes.
They've stepped up advertising and gotten exposure on
television shows. Industrywide sales figures don't exist, but
auto makers now see kit makers as more of a threat than in
the past.
   Ferrari has sued two U.S. kit makers in recent years, and
won each time. Because of that, other auto makers are finding
that merely threatening to sue kit makers for replicating
rare, expensive cars is enough. "The {kit-car} industry may
be forced to go back and do business a different way,"
contends George Evans, president of the Association of
Handcrafted Automobiles.
   That is precisely what the auto makers want. Lamborghini,
for example, finds companies that replicate its cars by
watching ads in kit-car magazines, and asks them to quit. So
far, Lamborghini says, its lawyers have sent letters to at
least three auto-replica companies, and all have ended
production. "It's like copying the Mona Lisa," asserts Mr.
Smith. "You can't imagine Da Vinci would be happy about it."
   But kit makers say you can't liken a Lamborghini Countach
to the Mona Lisa. They claim they're being bullied by large
auto companies who've got the money and the manpower to
outmuscle them.
   "At first I said I was going to fight," says California
kit maker Jim Kuzara, who stopped replicating the Countach
after he was contacted by Lamborghini. "But then logic
started to take over." Mr. Kuzara says he couldn't afford a
lengthy court battle, even though losing the Countach replica
would devastate his small business. The bread-and-butter
model had accounted for 80% of his company's sales.
   Lamborghini and Ferrari are the most aggressive in
attacking the kit makers, but they aren't alone. Rolls Royce
Motor Cars has taken two duplicators to court since the
1970s, and won both cases on the grounds of trademark
infringement. "If you try to doctor something up to look like
a Rolls we find it offensive," says spokesman Reg Abbiss.
   Ford Motor Co.'s Jaguar PLC unit, Porsche AG and
Daimler-Benz AG are likewise vigilant, threatening to sue kit
makers whose replicas hit too close to home. "We're very
strict with our trademark," asserts a spokesman for
Daimler-Benz, which makes Mercedes-Benz cars.
   But kit-car makers say they don't understand all the fuss.
"The cars are similar and we don't deny that," says Carl
Roberts, a Tennessee kit-car builder. "But you can't stop
people from making something that is similar to something
else."
   But the courts are doing just that. Earlier this year Mr.
Roberts was ordered to stop selling replicas of Spyder and
Testarossa models, both made by Ferrari.
   Sales of the look-alikes, which were built using the body
and engine of Chevrolet Corvettes, represented about 80% of
Mr. Roberts's cash flow. Mr. Roberts says he had to
temporarily shut down after the ruling, and now builds stunt
cars for movie makers, though they aren't nearly as
profitable as the Ferrari copycats had been. "They make it
difficult for a small businessman to survive," says Mr.
Roberts, who is appealing the court case that he lost.
   But auto companies say they have little sympathy for kit
makers. "The replicas dilute our good reputation," says Hugh
Steward, a spokesman for Ferrari. "Individuals who invest
large amounts of money in real Ferraris are upset when there
are cheap imitations on the road."

   Into Europe and Japan

   AMSTERDAM -- Arie Maas, chairman of the Dutch company that
just bought U.S. toy retailer FAO Schwarz, isn't thinking in
miniature.
   In an interview, the 56-year-old executive says his
company, N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer, or KBB, will help
expand the small chain of luxury toy stores by opening more
sites in the U.S. and breaking into Europe and Japan. KBB is
also browsing for more U.S. specialty-store chains. Owning
just one small chain in the U.S. wouldn't make financial
sense, Mr. Maas says. But he declines to give any hints about
specific targets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Schwarz purchase marks KBB's second foray into the
U.S., 10 years after a disappointing first attempt.
   In the late 1970s, KBB faced a common problem for big
players in small markets: It had little room for growth at
home and little experience abroad. Part of the company's
answer was its 1980 acquisition of the Maxway Inc. chain of
discount department stores, figuring its experience with
small towns would be of use for Maxway locations.
   Before it could really test that idea, however, KBB was
caught with heavy debts in the early 1980s, just as interest
rates soared and consumer spending dropped in the
Netherlands. In 1982, the company had a loss of 60 million
guilders ($34 million at current rates) and verged on
bankruptcy. It was forced to swallow an emergency injection
of equity from a bigger Dutch retailing rival, Vendex
International N.V., which still owns 36% of KBB.
   To reduce its debt, KBB then sold some of its assets,
including Maxway. By the mid-1980s, KBB figured it was
healthy enough to expand again, and this time decided to
diversify into smaller, specialty stores with the flexibility
to respond quickly to fads. In 1987 KBB bought M&amp;S Mode, a
Netherlands-based chain of mid-priced womenswear stores. The
following year, it acquired 60% of in RetailNet, which owns
chains of small Dutch stores specializing in household goods,
baby clothes, toys, lighting and home decor, and other
products.
   Finally, KBB felt bold enough to move abroad again, and
began looking to the U.S., where it believed its experience
with Maxway would be helpful. KBB was receptive when a U.S.
retailing consultant proposed the FAO Schwarz deal. KBB won't
disclose how much it paid for FAO Schwarz, but an industry
executive estimates the price at $40 million.
   With sales of about $50 million a year, FAO Schwarz is
tiny compared with KBB, whose sales last year totaled Fl 4.16
billion ($2.4 billion). But FAO's prestigious name and tight
focus suit KBB's strategy. FAO Schwarz concentrates on the
top end of the market, selling such items as $7,000 rocking
horses in a dazzling toyland atmosphere. Mr. Maas says that
means FAO doesn't need to worry when mass-market giants such
as Toys "R" Us Inc. play rough.
   Pieter Spierings, an analyst at Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank
N.V., says the acquisition looks logical on the surface but
is impossible to assess because KBB hasn't provided financial
details. Mr. Maas will say only that Schwarz is profitable
and that its sales, based on a comparable number of stores,
so far this year are up 20% from a year earlier.
   Because Schwarz operates just 17 stores -- including its
famous flagship on Fifth Avenue in New York -- Mr. Maas
figures there is plenty of room for expansion. Over the next
five years, he says, Schwarz could open as many as 60 stores
in the U.S., while continuing to expand its catalog sales.
   Schwarz already is studying the possibility of a store in
Tokyo, and Mr. Maas envisions a few stores in Europe,
starting perhaps in Paris or Frankfurt. Another possibility,
he says, is that some Schwarz toys might be sold at KBB's
Bijenkorf department stores. (The stores already have their
own hot-selling teddy bear, called BOB, after the Dutch
initials for "well-educated bear.")
   While it experiments abroad, KBB is trying to reinvigorate
its Hema unit. By far KBB's biggest Dutch chain, Hema
accounts for about half the company's sales. But after a long
run of success, Hema's operating profit has declined in the
past three years. The chain, which sells a grab bag of
merchandise running from cheap underwear to fine wines, is
faced with tough competition from exactly the kind of
specialty shops that KBB sees as its future.
   Hema "became a little bit sleepy over the past few years,"
says Roel Gooskens, an analyst at Van Meer James Capel N.V.
But KBB's Mr. Maas predicts Hema's results will start to
improve next year as it begins to benefit from new product
lines and renovated stores.
   Meanwhile, KBB's RetailNet unit is negotiating to acquire
Bruna BV, a Dutch chain of 450 book and stationery shops.
Eventually, Mr. Maas says, KBB might try to move more of its
specialty shops across borders in Europe. One candidate, he
says, is KBB's Praxis chain of do-it-yourself stores.
   Perhaps chastened by its past troubles, however, KBB
promises to proceed slowly. "I always say you can't keep two
watermelons in one hand," says Mr. Maas. "You're likely to
drop both."

   LONDON -- The British government broke off talks with
Hanson PLC about the sale of state-owned PowerGen and said it
will sell the country's second-largest electricity generator
through a public offering instead.
   The government's abrupt flip-flop came one month after it
said it might shelve the long-planned flotation -- part of
the Thatcher government's #11 billion ($21.19 billion)
electric-utility privatization -- because of Hanson's "firm
interest" in bidding for PowerGen. Since then, Hanson
executives have pored over the PowerGen books while the
government has endured criticism that Hanson, a longtime
government contributor, was being given unfair advantage in
the sale.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary John Wakeham indicated yesterday that the
government's decision to proceed with a sale to the public
was based on price. The Energy Department said Mr. Wakeham
concluded the terms of any sale to Hanson or another single
bidder "now offer insufficient benefit compared with
flotation," scheduled for next February. Analysts have said
the PowerGen sale could raise #1.1 billion or more.
   The department's statement indicated the government relied
on new information from a recent PowerGen board report that
boosted profit projections. The board has been hostile to the
idea of a Hanson takeover.
   Hanson declined to say what it had been prepared to pay or
whether it had submitted a formal bid.

   WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon said it will call up as many as
49,700 reserve troops over the next five weeks and post most
of them in Saudi Arabia.
   The first call-ups are expected as early as today, a
Defense Department spokesman said, with a maximum of 9,800 by
Aug. 31. As many as 39,900 more will be called by Oct. 1. The
Pentagon didn't name any of the units that would be called.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney approved the services'
requests for reserve call-ups and also authorized them to
require active-duty soldiers, sailors and airmen already in
the Middle East to delay plans to retire or quit. The
Pentagon announcement set the upper limit on the call-up
through Oct. 1, but not all of the reservists authorized are
expected to be called. The Marines, for instance, won
approval to call up about 3,000 troops, but are expected to
actually call only a small fraction of that number.
   Those called to active duty will serve 90-day tours, which
may be extended by another 90 days.
   The Pentagon said that most of the 24,734 Army reservists
that may be called would be sent to Saudi Arabia and assigned
to such tasks as handling food, fuel and ammunition. The
Navy, which can call 6,243 reservists -- about half of whom
would go to Saudi Arabia -- is looking for dock handlers and
medical personnel. The Air Force, which can call 14,476
reservists, needs air-transport crews. The Coast Guard can
call as many as 1,250.

   Colon Cancer Growth Is Halted in Tests
   By Replacing `Tumor Suppressor' Genes

   A team of scientists halted the growth of colon cancer
cells in a test tube by replacing a damaged gene with its
normal version.
   The experiment supports a new theory that certain genes
normally prevent uncontrolled, malignant cell growth and that
cancer arises when these "tumor suppressor" genes are damaged
or inactivated.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cancer researchers say that if they can discover how these
tumor suppressor genes work, they might learn how to stop the
growth of cancers. They might also devise tests for
determining whether a person has a defective tumor suppressor
gene and is therefore susceptible to cancer.
   The finding is the most important yet to come from a small
group of researchers at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in
Baltimore; they have spent six years searching for the
genetic chain reaction that initiates cancer growth. The
team, led by Bert Vogelstein, previously had identified
certain genes that normally regulate cell reproduction and
growth as key components of the chain reaction.
   Based on the Hopkins research and similar studies
elsewhere, scientists now believe that a cancer erupts if a
series of these tumor suppressor genes are damaged or somehow
altered. Thus, cancer researchers have hoped that inserting a
normal version of one or more of the genes back into a
cancerous cell might stop the cell's aberrant behavior.
   In a report published in this week's Science magazine, Dr.
Vogelstein and his colleagues showed that one of these genes,
called p53, could do just that, reversing malignant activity
of cells from a colon cancer tumor. Although the researchers
previously showed that a fully developed tumor cell contains
several different altered genes, "it appears that p53 by
itself" can return cells to normal growth, Dr. Vogelstein
said.
   "The normal p53 gene is what we hoped it might be, a
powerful inhibitor of colon cancer cell growth," Dr.
Vogelstein said. "The next step, of course, is to find out
exactly how the gene normally exerts this control. When we do
that, we'll have uncovered the pathway of a cancer, and,
hopefully, we can find ways to disrupt that pathway. But
finding how the gene works is going to be just as hard as
finding the gene in the first place," he said.
   The experiment "is an important step forward," said John
Minna, a chief cancer investigator at National Cancer
Institute who is studying the role of p53 and other tumor
suppressor genes in the genesis of lung cancer. "Several
laboratories are attempting to do the exact same experiment
involving cells from other types of tumors. We expect p53 to
play the same role in those cancers, too." He noted that
researchers at Temple University in Philadelphia recently
found that re-introducing a normal p53 gene could halt the
growth of brain cancer cells dividing in a test tube.
   Dr. Vogelstein and his colleagues first identified p53's
role in colon cancer early last year. Since then, the Hopkins
team and other researchers have found that the gene was
missing or damaged in cells in tumors of the brain, breast,
lung and bone. Every cell in the body contains two copies of
every gene. But the researchers have found that full-blown
tumors are missing one copy of the p53 gene and that the
second copy is very slightly mutated. Cells missing one copy
but still containing a second normal copy of the gene rarely
become cancerous. "One of our big questions, of course, is
how the one copy disappears and the other is damaged," Dr.
Minna said. "Research needs to be done to see if some people
inherit genetic material with the gene missing or damaged. If
that's true, then it would prove that a susceptibility to the
cancer can be inherited. We also want to show what can damage
the genes later in life because that would identify exactly
what kinds of things cause cancer."
   Dr. Vogelstein said tests still must be conducted to show
that replacing the damaged p53 in the body can squelch the
cancer. "I don't think it's feasible to actually replace the
gene," he said.
   The p53 gene, like all genes, acts by triggering a cell to
produce a protein. Dr. Vogelstein's team believes the damaged
p53 produces a mutant protein that distorts normal cell
action. The Hopkins researchers are studying how this protein
interacts with other genes or proteins in the cell, thus
illuminating the chain of events by which the cancer evolves.
   Several drug companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., a unit of Roche Holding Ltd., are
trying to develop drugs that would disrupt this chain.
   The latest Hopkins research was carried out by Dr.
Vogelstein, Suzanne Baker and Eric Fearon, along with Sanford
Markowitz and James Willson at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland.

comment. As the president of a business sales firm, I am
truly amazed that a part-time president of a small
manufacturing company felt he was so well versed in the art
of business acquisitions that he would proceed to paint
everyone in the business sales industry with the same
narrow-minded brush.
   It is possible that the brokers Mr. Jamison dealt with
were well aware he was looking to get "great mileage at
cocktail parties" by mentioning his plans to acquire another
company. What a professional business broker has to offer to
a serious buyer is invaluable. Please, Mr. Jamison, next time
you're looking for party chatter, stick to the repaving of
your parking lot. With any luck you won't be satisfied with
the job the paving company does for you and in your next
column you can bad-mouth every paving contractor in the
country.

   In "Dynasty Undone" on the family feud affecting U-Haul
(page one, July 16), I am quoted as saying, in reference to
Joe and Mark Shoen, "Their desire for absolute power is
insatiable. The more they have, the more they want." These
are accurate quotes from a confidential psychological report
that I submitted to their father and then-chairman of the
board, L.S. Shoen, 11 years ago. My concern is that the
public will believe that I authorized the release of these
quotes and therefore lose confidence in the professional
psychologist's commitment to the principle of
confidentiality. I did not authorize, nor did I know
beforehand, that these statements would be released. When I
completed my 10 months of work with the Shoen family, I wrote
and gave to the principal officer of U-Haul my assessment of
the working members of the family. It was clearly marked
confidential, but once a report leaves my hands I no longer
own nor control it. I am firmly committed to the principle of
confidentiality as stated by the American Psychological
Association and the Arizona Board of Psychological Examiners.

   Thoroughbred Auctions Are Reined In
   As Mideast Crisis Keeps Away Arabs

   DEAUVILLE, France -- "Good news]" cried Didier Krainc,
striding across the horse-racing grounds here last Saturday.
"The Arabs will be buying."
   Mr. Krainc, the marketing manager for the French
Thoroughbred Sales Agency, was doing his best to stir
enthusiasm into a glum and anxious crowd of horse breeders
and owners before the yearling sale began that evening. For
the most part, his audience remained unconvinced.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I'd rather be a gold trader than a horse trader at the
moment," said one despondent trainer after Mr. Krainc had
passed.
   So far, the pessimists appear to be justified. With Iraq's
Saddam Hussein facing off against a growing multinational
force in the Middle East, few Arabs seem inclined to while
away their time appraising horseflesh at the six-day sale in
this gambling and racing resort on the Normandy coast.
   Kuwait's ruling al-Sabah family, ousted from the tiny
sheikdom during the Iraqi invasion three weeks ago, "is one
of the most respected by other gulf families, and very few of
them would want to see their name appear now," explains one
bloodstock agent. "Would you want to be seen spending money
on baubles as the U.S. sends in its troops?"
   The nervousness here about the Arabs' attendance is
understandable. Over the past decade, Arab buyers from the
Persian Gulf countries have lavished piles of money on horses
in Europe and the U.S., building up large racing stables and
carrying off trophy after trophy at the major derbies. "The
Arabs spend about #200 million $385 million a year on their
horses," estimates Jocelyn de Moubray, editor of the British
racing weekly Pacemaker Update.
   Although Arab-owned stables are now well established and
breeding more of their own stock, such buyers as Saudi
Arabia's Prince Khaled Abdullah and the four al-Maktoum
brothers from Dubai's ruling family are still major players
on the yearling-sale circuit. The al-Maktoums alone dominate
European racing and, in more peaceful times, are frequent
visitors at such high-society gatherings as Ascot, where they
are often seen decked out in top hats and tails, gracing the
Royal Enclosure.
   "The al-Maktoums have 500 or 600 horses in training every
year," says one of their trainers at Deauville. Other, older
stables -- the Aga Khan's, for example, which has about 140
in training -- pale by comparison.
   Arab money usually represents about 40% of the sales by
value at Kentucky's Keeneland yearling auction, the largest
in the U.S. At the Deauville event, the season's first
European sale for yearlings, Arab purchases typically account
for 10% to 15% of the value of horses sold.
   But this year the Arabs, and the al-Maktoums especially,
are likely to be more attentive to the odds on Saddam Hussein
than to those on their horses. Sheik Mohammed al-Maktoum is
the defense minister of the United Arab Emirates, a union of
small desert kingdoms, including Dubai, that aren't far from
Kuwait as the missile flies and that have recently become a
target of the Iraqi leader's bellicose speeches for breaking
oil quotas. Other Arab buyers have already played shy at the
yearling sale at Saratoga, N.Y., which was held shortly after
Iraqi troops marched into Kuwait.
   "If there's a risk of war, you can't expect people to
commit themselves to buying anything, be it apartment blocks
or horses," says Richard Galpin, a British blood-stock agent.
   In the minds of many of the breeders and owners at
Deauville, there is one hope: the Japanese. Amid economic ups
and downs, horse racing has always shown resilience because
of the attractions it holds for new money. And Japanese
wealth, coming in the wake of Arab and U.S. fortunes, has
proved no exception.
   "We're starting to feel the effects of Japanese money at
the sales," says Luca Cumani, a trainer for Sheik Mohammed
al-Maktoum and the Aga Khan. Indeed, top prices at both the
Keeneland and Saratoga sales this year were paid by Japanese
buyers. And at Deauville, there seem to be more Japanese
visitors than ever before, though few of them are well-known
buyers.
   When the Deauville auction began Saturday evening, the
bidding started slowly, and prices were disappointing -- down
20% compared with last year. Moreover, fewer than half of the
first 30 horses were sold. Among those buyers, there were no
Arabs and only one Japanese.
   "It's a soft market," complained Patrick Chedeville, who
runs one of France's largest commercial breeding operations.
Another breeder, more hopefully, called it "selective."
   Only with the bidding for the 38th lot -- a colt, sired by
the European stallion Sadler's Wells, which was expected to
attract the interest of an al-Maktoum stable -- were spirits
revived. Eshoku Zen and Kihachiro Watanabe, two Japanese
owners, competed for the horse, pushing other bidders aside
as the price climbed.
   At 6.5 million French francs ($1.25 million), four times
the sale price of any other horse at the evening's auction,
Mr. Zen dropped out, leaving the colt to Mr. Watanabe, owner
of the transport company Toko Corp. Although the price was
well below Mr. Zen's 1985 record of 9 million francs for a
Deauville yearling, it equals last year's top price paid by
Crown Prince Maktoum al-Maktoum, the eldest of the four Dubai
brothers.
   Eventually, an Arab buyer did appear. Although it was only
one Arab, bidding for one of the less well known and cheaper
horses, it was enough to stir excitement. The television
cameras covering the sale swung around to focus on him.
   Fati Kalla, a London-based Palestinian and former film
producer, ended up buying two horses at the sale that
evening, which he said went better than he had expected. "The
Japanese are here to pick up the best yearlings . . . so
prices were reasonable," he noted. "But the money isn't there
like it was before the Iraqi invasion."
   It was only on Sunday, after the initial glare of
publicity surrounding the sales had subsided, that Saudi
Arabia's Prince Abdullah arrived here from London. The prince
appeared at the auction ring on Sunday evening and bid
780,000 francs for a colt.
   Beside the sums of earlier years, it was a modest
purchase. But Mr. Krainc seemed vindicated. "Things," he
insisted, "are looking much better."

   WASHINGTON -- Let's assume the nightmare comes true: Iraq
attacks U.S. troops or Saudi cities with chemical weapons as
part of a major war. Should the U.S. fight back with chemical
or even nuclear weapons?
   A number of military analysts say the answer is no. Even
though chemical or nuclear weapons promise a quick victory in
battle -- and an emotionally satisfying response to a
barbarous attack -- the political fallout from using these
weapons would be disastrous to U.S. interests. Moreover, the
analysts say, the U.S. has more than enough aircraft and
missiles to destroy Iraqi targets using conventional bombs in
a war. Nuclear and chemical weapons don't add that much
militarily.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "It's a losing proposition," says retired Maj. Gen. Elmer
Pendleton, who was the Pentagon's senior officer in Turkey.
"With our massive air ability, we can do the job as well"
without nuclear or chemical weapons.
   Using even small battlefield nuclear weapons would be a
"disastrous mistake," adds Gary Milhollin, an arms control
expert at the University of Wisconsin Law School. "It would
be a signal to all the countries in the Third World that to
stand up to the First World they need nuclear weapons."
   One reason that the U.S. can contemplate more seriously
using chemical or nuclear weapons is the easing of relations
with the Soviet Union, says retired Adm. Thomas Moorer, a
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The two
superpowers aren't backing different sides in this conflict,
so the U.S. can worry far less about retaliation from the
Soviet Union.
   "With them {the Soviet Union} out of the picture, it has a
significant impact on the flexibility available to the
president," Adm. Moorer says. During this crisis, for
instance, the U.S. has been able to empty the Mediterranean
of aircraft carriers because of the diminished Soviet threat
in Europe.
   Last October, about 20 military planners sat down for a
war game to plot U.S. responses to a chemical attack by a
country in the Middle East, says Francis West, president of
Gama Corp., a Falls Church, Va., consulting firm that stages
war games for the Defense Department. They quickly realized,
says Mr. West, that the U.S. didn't need to resort to
chemical weapons to deal a devastating blow to the attacker.
That's a calculation the Iraqis can make as well, Mr. West
says, and one that might disincline them from attacking.
   "It's hard to see any initiation of chemical weapons by
Iraq where it doesn't come out much worse for them" if the
U.S. uses only conventional weapons, he says. "That's the
essence of deterrence."
   In addition, the U.S. is likely to reject out of hand a
strategy of terror involving bombing a city in Iraq with
chemical or nuclear weapons in retaliation for a chemical
attack on a Saudi city. "The last thing I'd do is say that
because {Saddam Hussein} attacks a population, I'd attack a
population," says Albert Wohlstetter, a nuclear strategist
who has greatly influenced Pentagon thinking. "It's like
saying that if a terrorist kills your child, you kill his."
   And using chemical or nuclear weapons effectively in a
battle is very difficult. A change in wind could spread
killer microbes launched against Iraqi soldiers over
civilians or U.S. soldiers instead. The potency of chemical
agents also dissipates over time, making the weapons
relatively ineffective against such targets as airfields or
Iraqi chemical and nuclear research facilities.
   Nuclear weapons, on the other hand, are so destructive
that they can't be used anywhere near U.S. troops or
civilians -- essentially ruling out their use in a battle to
retake Kuwait. Even the smallest nuclear weapons, fired by
Howitzers, can kill anything in an area nearly one-half mile
across.
   Any use of chemical or nuclear weapons by the U.S., even
in retaliation, also would produce heavy political damage.
International support, so critical for the economic blockage
against Iraq, would wither, say analysts, and opposition
would mushroom at home. "If we retaliate with chemical
weapons, we're getting into the mud with the pigs," says
Lawrence Korb, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
"We can accomplish our objectives with conventional weapons."
   For all the incentives against the use of these weapons by
the U.S., Iraq can hardly rest easy that the U.S. will
forswear them. It's impossible to gauge the effect of cries
for revenge on policy makers if U.S. soldiers are gassed,
with grisly pictures of their remains broadcast to this
country. "When survivability {of U.S. troops} hits the mind
of the American people, we're capable of doing anything
{Saddam Hussein} can dream up," says Adm. Moorer.
   Indeed, Mr. Wohlstetter, the defense strategist,
recommends retaliating to a chemical attack by launching a
chemical attack against encampments of Iraqi soldiers -- even
though he recognizes the political risks. A U.S. chemical
attack would force Iraqi soldiers in future battles to don
protective gear, which can reduce their effectiveness by a
factor of six, he calculates. And it would also deter a
second chemical attack by Iraq.
   "Hitler didn't use gas," Mr. Wohlstetter says, "because he
didn't think there would be a net gain from using them."

   Uncovering the Awful Truth of Nicaragua's Killing Fields

   In early 1987 in a remote UN refugee camp in rural Costa
Rica, Jose Aguirre Sanchez, a 57-year-old bean farmer from
southern Nicaragua, told me about Sandinista mass murders in
his home village 18 months before that drove him into exile:
   "The Sandinista army started killing civilians. My close
friend was killed in it. He read a Catholic Bible and liked
to tell people about it. He was kind of a preacher. One day
the Sandinistas surrounded his house while he was eating
dinner. The Sandinistas threw a grenade at the house and
started shooting at it. They shot my friend in the arm and
all the children in the house ran out. The Sandinistas said
they would take my friend to the hospital to get treatment
for the gunshot wound and led him away. Instead they killed
him. His mutilated body was found later. His name was Rufino
Laguna. We didn't tell the authorities because we were
afraid. The Sandinista soldiers started killing other people
in the town."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On that visit to two refugee camps for Nicaraguans in
Costa Rica, historian Ronald Radosh and I interviewed 50
refugees who told of similar experiences of fleeing lethal
Sandinista army attacks on remote villages where the Contras
had passed through but were not present during the assaults.
They said scores of women, children and other civilians were
murdered in cold blood. We concluded that the Sandinistas had
a counterinsurgency policy of "draining the sea," that is,
killing or driving out the "sea" of rural peasants who could
lend support to the guerrillas.
   Other evidence of political massacres by the Sandinistas
emerged as well. Shortly after our report was publicized,
Gary Moore, an investigator with the Washington-based
National Forum Foundation, went on muleback to remote areas
inside Nicaragua. There, he taped villagers attesting to
political murders by Sandinista security officials (an effort
that landed him in prison and resulted in the confiscation of
some of his documentation).
   What was the reaction of the international human rights
community to these and other shocking reports? Most ignored
the few who spoke up, following the lead of Americas Watch,
the most prominent human rights group concentrating on Latin
America. Americas Watch retraced our steps in the refugee
camps, but cast doubts on the refugee reports by criticizing
us for not collecting corroborating evidence of massacres
inside Nicaragua -- in war zones closed to foreign
investigators but where, they claimed, they had free access.
   Americas Watch went even further stating, in a report
issued the same month as my organization's refugee report:
"The government of Nicaragua does not engage in a pattern of
violations of the laws of war. Nor does it engage in
systematic violations of the right to life or to physical
integrity of detainees. . . . Nor does it engage in a
deliberate pattern of forced disappearances of persons."
   In 1989, when Americas Watch acknowledged that Nicaraguan
armed forces "engaged in a pattern of killings" in northern
Nicaragua, it stated that it believed the killings were "a
new phenomenon." In other words, any prior killings by
Sandinistas were acts of individuals and did not reflect
official policy.
   But now evidence of the awful truth has become
irrefutable, thanks in large part to the courageous work of
Marta Patricia Baltodano, a Nicaraguan human rights lawyer
and director of the Nicaraguan Association Pro Human
Rights-established by the U.S. State Department to
investigate and prosecute Contra human rights violations.
Since the Sandinistas' electoral defeat, she has been able to
uncover eight secret mass graves in remote northern Nicaragua
that corroborate the earliest reports of systematic killings
of civilians by Sandinista soldiers and militants.
   Working with four lawyers, a forensic doctor and local
witnesses no longer afraid to testify, Ms. Baltodano has
already established that three of the graves contain the
remains of civilians murdered by Sandinista military and
State Security personnel (Nicaragua's secret police, who were
trained and assisted until February by their East German
counterparts, the dread Stasi). The five others still are
under investigation. In the excavation of each gravesite, the
new, freely elected mayors have been eager to help. Ms.
Baltodano told me that local "campesinos", who have been too
afraid to speak openly about the murders before, have now
enthusiastically volunteered to shovel out the sites and air
the truth.
   In the most recent discovery, on Aug. 15 in Murra, a town
close to the Honduran border, Ms. Baltodano's group, with a
large local crowd looking on, found 17 skeletons. Fourteen of
the bodies have been identified as evangelicals who were
rounded up by a Sandinista battalion, forced to dig their own
grave and then shot or stabbed to death on April 10, 1982 --
when the Contra war was still in its infancy. Family members
identified the victims through gold fillings in their teeth,
remnants of clothes, and in one case an agrarian reform ID
number linking him to a local farming cooperative.
   In June, the Nicaraguan Association found another shallow
grave in Mokoron, 220 yards from a Sandinista military
battalion near Wiwili in northern Jinotega. This site yielded
parts of 11 skeletons. One by one the relatives of eight of
the victims have come forward to identify them. They were
caught by the State Security while trying to escape being
dragooned into the Sandinista army in October 1983. The
remains of two adults and a seven-year-old child have not
been identified. Cords used to bind the victims were found,
and the forensic examiner concluded the victims' throats had
been cut.
   There is every indication that Ms. Baltodano's findings
are only the tip of the iceberg. Every week campesinos
cautiously come to her with new leads. Her office, already
overwhelmed, has not yet investigated in Nueva Guinea, Punta
Gorda and the villages of southern Zelaya, where the refugees
I interviewed came from. Nor has she checked the area along
the Atlantic coast, where many Nicaraguan Indians, targeted
by Sandinista authorities as civilian dissidents,
disappeared.
   That the Sandinistas were able to get away with the
summary execution of noncombatants is in no small part due to
the failure of some of the main human rights groups that deal
with Latin America. The Sandinistas even cited Americas Watch
reports to deflect too-close scrutiny on rights-abuse
charges. At the same time, reports (such as ours) that
documented Sandinista abuses were attacked and dismissed as
having been trumped up by or linked to the CIA.
   The Organization of American States' Human Rights
Commission recently met with Ms. Baltodano to discuss her
findings. But so far none of the private human rights groups
that concentrate on Latin America have shown much interest in
her work. As they did in Chile and Argentina, these groups
should be insisting on a full accounting. Even though an
amnesty law in Nicaragua may bar the prosecution of war
criminals and rights violators, a full investigation should
be supported out of humanitarian concern for the victims'
families and in the interest of justice.

   WASHINGTON -- As the U.S. headed toward a crucial test
today in its war of nerves with Saddam Hussein, the Bush
administration coordinated a multinational effort to provide
aid to some nations that are being hurt by the embargo of
Iraq.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in an interview yesterday
on ABC television, warned the Iraqi leader that it would be
"a mistake" to follow through on his threat to close Western
embassies today in Kuwait.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We don't recognize the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait and I
think most of us are determined to keep our embassies open,"
Mr. Cheney said.
   But it appeared that the U.S. wants to avoid a military
clash at its Kuwait embassy. The administration said the
embassy's Marine guards had left Wednesday night with other
officials and dependents in a convoy that arrived yesterday
in Baghdad; State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the U.S had "received assurances" that the embassy personnel
would be free to depart Baghdad.
   Mr. Boucher emphasized that the U.S. ambassador to Kuwait,
W. Nathaniel Howell and enough embassy staff "to take care of
those functions that they have to do there" -- primarily
helping Americans trapped in the country -- would remain. A
State Department official said the embassy staff had been
reduced to 10 people from 120.
   An Iraqi official, in an interview published in the French
daily Le Figaro, said Iraq would consider it the "equivalent
of an act of aggression" if the Western embassies remain
open.
   Iraq attempted to balance those threatening words by
releasing a staged videotape showing Saddam Hussein meeting
with a group of Western hostages, including women and
children. Patting the head of a child standing beside him,
the Iraqi president said he cared about the hostages'
well-being and was keeping them in Iraq in order to keep
peace. He then posed for a group picture with them.
   Mr. Boucher called the performance "shameful theater."
   Iraq also has pulled back its elite Republican Guards
units from Kuwait's border with Saudi Arabia and replaced
them with backup forces, NBC News reported. A State
Department official said the move appeared to be a troop
rotation since the overall Iraqi troop level in Kuwait
remained unchanged.
   Meanwhile, Bush administration officials said they expect
to complete by this weekend an analysis of the economic needs
of Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, which have suffered substantial
economic harm as a result of the embargo.
   The U.S. and its allies want to use aid to prod Jordanian
King Hussein away from his support of Saddam Hussein.
Japanese government officials say Foreign Minister Taro
Nakayama met with King Hussein for half an hour during a
Mideast tour and said Japan was willing to extend aid,
provided Jordan abides by the United Nations resolution
blocking trade with Iraq.
   A U.S. official commented: "You can't give anybody help
from the effects of the embargo if they aren't honoring the
embargo."
   In the cases of Egypt and Turkey, the administration hopes
that aid will minimize domestic discontent, thus ensuring
that the coalition against the Iraqi dictator will hold
together.
   President Bush personally has asked Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu to help some troubled Mideast
countries, according to Japanese government officials. And a
senior U.S. official said he expected the U.S. to begin
discussions next week with other possible donor nations,
including West Germany, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and
the United Arab Emirates. Some of these nations already have
promised or have begun providing assistance to Jordan and
Egypt.
   "We're talking about coordinating a multilateral effort,"
the senior U.S. official said. He added that this effort
didn't yet "have a price tag."
   According to preliminary estimates, that price tag could
be substantial. A day after Jordan's King Hussein left the
U.S. last week, his finance minister, Basil Jardanah, gave
the Bush administration a seven-page paper stating that
Jordan's losses from the Gulf crisis could be as high as $2
billion over the next year, or about half its annual economic
output.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in Cairo earlier
this week that his nation was likely to lose at least $2
billion on an annual basis as a result of the disruptions
caused by the Gulf crisis. And a spokeswoman at the Turkish
Embassy here estimated that Turkey's losses would be at least
$2.5 billion.
   Some of the major prospective losses listed by Jordan,
according to Jordanians and others familiar with the document
given to Treasury and State Department officials, include:
$200 million in exports, mostly food, to Iraq; $200 million
in fees for goods passing through Jordan; and over $300
million in remittances from Jordanians living in Kuwait.
Jordan also expects to lose about $190 million that it
receives annually in direct aid from Iraq and Kuwait, and it
expects that Iraq will discontinue about $295 million in debt
repayments.
   Jordan submitted a similar document to the U.N. Security
Council.
   Although U.S. officials are deeply upset with King
Hussein, they recognize that he is in dire straits. About 60%
of his population consists of Palestinians, most of whom are
wildly enthusiastic about Saddam Hussein. Jordan's economy is
weak, and Jordanian officials estimate that even if the
country is compensated for its losses, the return of over
100,000 workers and their families from Kuwait could double
Jordan's unemployment rate, currently somewhere between 15%
and 20%.
   According to an Egyptian official, Cairo's immediate
problems are providing transport home for many of its 1.2
million citizens who are fleeing from Iraq and Kuwait, and
absorbing them into its sluggish economy. Many Egyptians who
fled now are penniless in Jordan.
   Many of the Egyptians in Kuwait held high-paying
professional jobs and sent home an estimated $3 billion
yearly, according to an Egyptian official here. The offical
told of a personal friend who spent 22 years in Kuwait and
accumulated considerable savings but was unable to take
anything with him when he left for Jordan.
   The European Community announced yesterday that it
approved spending $1.3 million to help fly refugees out of
Jordan, according to Reuters. And a spokesman at the West
German embassy in Washington said his nation was sending a
relief airplane to Jordan.

   Multibillion-Dollar Pyramid Scam
   Leads to Taiwan Executives' Arrest

   TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Prosecutors lowered the boom on the Hung
Yuan Group, the underground investment house that at its peak
controlled billions of dollars and whose downfall wiped out
the savings of thousands of small investors in Taiwan.
   In the past two days, almost all top Hung Yuan officials
have been arrested on suspicion of violating the country's
banking law. In Taipei, the prosecutor's office confirmed the
arrest of eight officials, including the group's head, Shen
Changsheng. Three other officials were reported under arrest
in other cities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan's Bureau of Investigation said it had summoned 42
people for questioning and that its agents searched 33
offices and residences. But Taiwan newspapers reported that
several Hung Yuan officials couldn't be located, including Yu
Yungming, Hung Yuan's former president.
   The government also froze what little remains of Hung
Yuan's assets, which officials and analysts say were amassed
primarily through a pyramid deposit-taking scheme that
offered very high returns, and through real estate
speculation and stock market manipulation. Late last year,
the Bureau of Investigation said it believed the group's
deposits totaled $6 billion. One Taiwan newspaper reported
that Mr. Shen had told investigators Hung Yuan owed $3.5
billion to depositors and still has about $1.1 billion in
assets.
   But analysts said the assets are probably far less than
$1.1 billion -- and most of that is probably land holdings
that are losing value because of the severe downturn in the
local property market.
   The government crackdown comes more than seven months
after Hung Yuan suspended all interest payments and
withdrawals. Hung Yuan's once-bustling head offices were
quiet, although several burly employees manned the reception
desk in case of trouble from angry depositors.
   "Investors have to know that most of what they invested
won't be recovered," said Thomas Hwang, general manager of
the ROC Banking Institute.
   Most significantly, the arrests passed without notice on
the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where Hung Yuan used to push
stocks up and down at will. In the past, the very rumor of a
government investigation of the group would send the market
plummeting. But on Thursday, all eyes were on the Middle East
and Tokyo, where the Nikkei Stock Average fell 5.8%. Taipei's
weighted price index ended the day down 173.34 points, or
4.9%, at 3333.46.
   Hung Yuan and the 170 mostly short-lived imitators it
spawned were underground in name only. The group had a
flamboyant presence in the late 1980s, when the quest for
easy money and speculative investments became a way of life
for millions of people on Taiwan. Before its fall, Hung Yuan
had a 7,000-person sales force and 200,000 investors enticed
by annual interest rates of nearly 50%. The whole gray-market
investment industry is estimated to have attracted $8 billion
before it fell.
   With the exception of some early investors who weren't
foolish enough to reinvest their profits in the group,
analysts say few people benefited from Hung Yuan's rise. That
includes the sales force, most of whom sank large sums in the
company.
   Most investors didn't know that some of Hung Yuan's senior
officials had criminal records. Mr. Shen has been prosecuted
for robbery, fraud, possessing stolen goods, assault and
forging securities. Mr. Yu, his lieutenant, has been
prosecuted for fraud, forgery and violating
negotiable-instrument laws. According to police records, both
have spent time in jail. Still, Mr. Shen and Hung Yuan
inspired intense devotion from investors.
   The beginning of the end came in July 1989, when the
government enacted a tough banking law that allows only
licensed banks to offer interest payments in return for
money. Most of the underground houses soon collapsed, but
Hung Yuan survived longer by suspending interest payments and
withdrawals.

   Exiled Kuwaiti Government Says Iraq
   Has Threatened to Demolish Oil Wells

   TAIF, Saudi Arabia -- Officials of Kuwait's
government-in-exile here say Iraqi troops have mined most of
Kuwait's oil wells and threatened to blow them up if Iraq's
occupying forces are attacked.
   The officials also described life in the captured city of
Kuwait, where they said resistance to the Iraqis, led by
neighborhood cooperatives and Kuwaiti women, continues to
build.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We are willing to sacrifice everything -- not only our
money, but also our blood -- for the liberation of our
country," said Crown Prince Saad Abdullah al-Sabah, the
second-ranking official in the Kuwaiti government.
   He and Ali Jaber al-Sabah, brother-in-law of the emir of
Kuwait, said that some Kuwaitis who had fled the oil-rich
Persian Gulf country have been infiltrating back to organize
armed resistance. Some of them are officers of Kuwait's
military.
   Mr. Jaber, who is also marketing director of the
state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp., said the company is
buying 250,000 barrels of oil a day from Saudi Arabia and
other Gulf states and will continue to supply its gasoline
stations and refineries in Europe.
   The two Kuwaiti officials spoke at a hotel in this resort
city in the mountains near Jeddah and the Red Sea. The hotel,
tightly guarded by Saudi soldiers, has been turned into the
exile headquarters of the Kuwaiti government. It is near the
summer palace of King Fahd, the ruler of Saudi Arabia. Saudi
officials flew foreign reporters from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia,
to the news conference here.
   Mr. Jaber said dynamite had been attached to what are
called "Christmas trees," elaborate systems of valves
attached to the tops of oil wells. He said the Iraqis so far
haven't wired detonators to the explosives. If Kuwait's
fields were damaged by explosions, he said, they could be
brought back to production within six months.
   Citing reports from within Kuwait, he said the Iraqi army
has attempted to stop demonstrations and other acts of
disobedience by women and children by arresting them and
imprisoning them in two downtown palaces. He described the
palaces as "concentration camps" where some women are beaten.
   Nonetheless, he said, the demonstrations continue, with
women taunting the Iraqi soldiers from the rooftops every
night, shouting "Allahu akbar" to indicate that they fear
only God.
   Iraqi soldiers, according to Mr. Jaber, fear snipers and
have stopped patrolling at night, leaving the streets to
groups organized by neighborhood residents to prevent
looting. Other teams, mostly young men, collect garbage and
help distribute food.
   Young Kuwaitis, he said, have killed Iraqi cab drivers
bringing carloads of looters from Basra in Iraq. They also
have firebombed vans loaded with stolen furniture as looters
drove them north into Iraq.
   Iraqi soldiers, he said, also have been looting each
other. "The Iraqi soldier who steals cars and takes them to
the border is often met by a bigger fish who takes it from
him," said Mr. Jaber. He explained that the "bigger fish" is
usually a more senior military officer.
   He said Kuwaiti workers continue to pump 200,000 barrels
of oil a day from the captured fields, just enough to run the
local power plant and water desalination facility. Otherwise,
according to Mr. Jaber, Kuwaitis generally are refusing to
return to work.
   Mr. Jaber confirmed news reports that a warning from
Kuwait's Defense Ministry thwarted an Iraqi attempt to
capture the emir and the crown prince when Iraq's tank forces
invaded Kuwait in the early hours of Aug. 2.
   Although enemy helicopters were landing at the emir's
palace, the two rulers managed to escape by car, driving
south to the Saudi border.
   "The Kuwaiti government is alive and well," the crown
prince told reporters. "We are receiving reports from our
brothers in Kuwait and from our embassies all over the
world."

   Law -- Legal Beat:
   Federal Courts May Allow TV Cameras

   Federal courts may soon follow most state courts in
opening their doors to the scrutiny of television viewers.
   A committee of federal judges has issued a report
recommending that cameras be allowed in federal courtrooms on
an experimental basis. The plan, which requires the approval
of the U.S. Judicial Conference, would allow cameras into
civil proceedings in six district courts and two appeals
courts for three years. The courts would participate on a
volunteer basis beginning July 1, 1991.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Timothy Dyk, a Washington attorney who represents a
coalition of news organizations including the National
Association of Broadcasters, C-Span and several newspapers,
has been trying to persuade the U.S. Judicial Conference to
permit cameras and other broadcast equipment into federal
courtrooms for nearly seven years. The Conference is headed
by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and sets rules for all
nonmilitary federal courts except the Supreme Court.
   The Judicial Conference will decide whether to authorize
the plan at its September session. Advocates believe that the
experiment has a good chance of getting approval. In a May 7,
1990, letter to U.S. Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, a proponent
of cameras in the courts, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, "I
am by no means averse to the idea of the sort of experiment
with television and radio coverage in federal courts which
you describe."
   Proponents of cameras in the courts have long argued that
the benefits include public education and the incentive for
courts under the watchful eye of the public to work more
efficiently. They say that modern cameras and
state-of-the-art lighting and sound equipment permits
broadcasters to work without being intrusive.
   "The benefit is that it takes the mystique and elitism out
of the law and puts the law on a level of everyman," said
James Goodale, a New York attorney and media specialist.
   According to Mr. Dyk, 45 states allow cameras in their
courts. "The federal courts are about to enter the electronic
age," he said. "What having cameras means in part is that the
public will have greater confidence in the judicial system by
seeing how it works."
   Opponents fear that lights, cameras and microphones might
disrupt courtroom proceedings. They also worry that the
broadcast media might misinterpret or trivialize legal issues
and that jurors and witnesses might alter their performance
if they are televised.
   The committee that proposed the plan, the Ad Hoc Committee
on Cameras in the Courtroom, recommended against opening the
courts to cameras last fall. The committee's chairman, U.S.
District Judge Robert Peckham, of San Francisco, couldn't be
reached for comment.
   Two people familiar with the decision said that lobbying
efforts by Steven Brill, president of the American Lawyer
Media Limited Partnership, in which Time Warner Inc. is a
limited partner, may have influenced the committee to change
its position. Mr. Brill is planning to launch a 24-hour cable
channel primarily devoted to live trial coverage.
   "The argument is basic," said Mr. Brill. "If there's one
branch of government that is meant to be public, it's the
courts. . . . The strength of a democracy is based on people
knowing what's going on."

   FEDERAL APPEALS COURT rules lender is not liable for waste
cleanup.
   The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Portland, Ore.,
ruled that the Port of St. Helens, a municipal corporation
that issues revenue bonds to promote industrial development
in St. Helens, Ore., is not liable for the cleanup of
hazardous waste on property that it owns.
   The decision marks the second time that a federal appeals
court has ruled on the scope of an exemption in the federal
Superfund law that shields lenders from liability when they
have a security interest in a company but don't participate
in its management. Under Superfund, those who own or operate
contaminated sites are responsible for cleaning them up.
   In the decision, the appeals panel ruled that the port did
not have to pay the cleanup bill because it had not exercised
any management authority at the site.
   Environmental lawyers said the decision is significant
because it appears to conflict with a May ruling by a federal
appeals court and could set the stage for a challenge in the
U.S. Supreme Court. An Atlanta court found lenders do not
have to be involved in the day-to-day operations of a
facility to incur liability.
   In the current case, the port issued bonds in 1981 to
Bergsoe Metals Corp. of St. Helens to finance the
construction of a recycling plant. The port holds the title
to the property.
   In 1986, Bergsoe was put into involuntary bankruptcy
proceedings. By that time, state environmental authorities
had determined that the plant was contaminated with hazardous
waste.
   The bankruptcy trustee sued East Asiatic Ltd. of New York
and East Asiatic Inc. of Copenhagen, former shareholders of
the company, seeking to hold the companies liable for the
cleanup. (That case is still pending.) Those companies then
sued the port, alleging that the port is liable for the
cleanup costs.
   In a key finding, the appeals panel rejected the
plaintiffs' argument that the port is not covered by the
exemption because it negotiated the building of the plant and
maintained the right to inspect the site.
   The court wrote that "merely having the power to get
involved in management, but failing to exercise it, is not
enough" to incur liability under Superfund.
   "The opinion should comfort lenders because it
distinguishes between the power to manage and the actual
management of a borrower's operation," said Lawrence P.
Schnapf of the New York firm Lord Day &amp; Lord, Barrett Smith,
an environmental lawyer not involved in the case.
   Elizabeth Conklyn, of the Seattle firm Bogle &amp; Gates, a
lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that her clients had not
decided whether to appeal. "It is our position that the port
took sufficient action to indicate it might be liable," Ms.
Conklyn said.
   A lawyer for the port couldn't be reached for comment.

   APPEALS COURT WIPES OUT $26.6 million award to Eli Lilly.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated
a lower court's finding that Medtronic Inc. infringed on an
Eli Lilly &amp; Co. patent, and dismissed a related 1988 $26.6
million damage award.
   The ruling was expected because the U.S. Supreme Court in
June found in favor of Medtronic's central argument in the
case, and sent the matter back to the court of appeals.
   Lilly had sued Medtronic for infringement of a patent on a
heart pacemaker. Medtronic, a maker of biomedical devices,
claimed that a 1984 amendment to a federal law -- which
permits companies to produce drugs patented by other
companies if the manufacture is intended solely for the
gathering of data for an application to the Food and Drug
Administration -- also applied to its heart device. The heart
device also requires FDA approval.
   A federal district court in Philadelphia ruled that the
amendment applied only to drugs, and a jury awarded the $26.6
million to Lilly in 1988. But the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled
in March 1989 that the law wasn't restricted to drugs.
   In June, the U.S. Supreme Court also found that Medtronic
was protected by the law's exception to patent infringement
claims. Lilly's patent on the device expires in October.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals' ruling also erases
contempt-of-court citations issued against Medtronic by the
federal court in Philadelphia, as well as certain injunctions
that had remained in place.
   Medtronic said the lower court's earlier contempt finding
had "held chilling implications for medical research
activities and onerous overtones limiting First Amendment
protection for scientific dialogue." The company said that it
is "extremely pleased that the company's position has been
vindicated after seven years of intense litigation."
   The appeals court remanded the case to the lower court for
final action. A Lilly spokesman said: "We are disappointed
with the court's decision." He added, "Since this is ongoing
litigation, we would prefer not to comment further."

   AT&amp;T IS SUED for not paying benefit to deceased employee's
unmarried partner.
   The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan, is believed to be the
first federal case over "domestic partnership" benefits. It
claims that American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. discriminated
against the partner of a deceased lesbian employee by not
paying her a sickness-death benefit that is routinely given
to surviving family members.
   In the suit, Sandra Rovira of New Rochelle, N.Y., alleged
that by not paying the benefit, AT&amp;T violated city and state
discrimination laws -- as well as its own personnel policy,
which bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
or marital status. The suit claims that AT&amp;T also violated
federal labor law by not following its personnel policy. The
policy says the company will not discriminate in providing
the benefit, according to the suit.
   A spokesman for AT&amp;T said, "AT&amp;T doesn't discriminate on
any basis, including sexual preference." He said the
company's benefits committee rejected Ms. Rovira's benefit
claim on the basis of "state law regarding the legal status
of the relationship."
   Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay-rights
group representing Ms. Rovira, said that AT&amp;T's
sickness-death benefit usually equals one year of the
deceased employee's salary. The suit asked the court to order
AT&amp;T to pay the benefit, estimated at $58,000, plus damages
of $75,000 for the alleged discrimination.
   Ms. Rovira's companion, Marjorie Forlini, an AT&amp;T sales
manager, worked at the company for 18 years until she died of
cancer in 1988. She and Ms. Rovira lived together for 12
years and considered themselves a married couple, the suit
argues.
   Ms. Forlini helped raise and support Ms. Rovira's two
sons, who also were denied the benefit, according to the
suit.

   THRIVING IN THE U.S.S.R.: Philadelphia firm lines up
Soviet business.
   Schnader, Harrison, Segal &amp; Lewis has been retained by a
number of Soviet government and private entities to appraise
business offers and look into trade options. Among its
clients are the Russian republic of the Soviet Union, the
city of Leningrad and a major Soviet magazine, Literaturnaya
Gazeta.
   Jerome Shestack, the senior partner who conducted the
negotiations, said the Russian republic and the city of
Leningrad have taken the lead in encouraging entrepreneurial
efforts in the Soviet Union. "They are more receptive to
free-enterprise types of solutions than the central
government at this point," said Mr. Shestack, formerly the
U.S. representative to the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights.
   Mr. Shestack said much of the firm's work will involve
evaluating offers the Soviets have received from American
businesses. The Soviets also are seeking advice on their own
trade and financial proposals, Mr. Shestack said, such as a
possible employee stock-ownership plan for Literaturnaya
Gazeta and a Leningrad joint venture with a U.S. department
store.
   The law firm also is working in the U.S. to help fund the
restoration of buildings in Leningrad.

   GULF CRISIS spurs Houston law firm to offer free phone
service.
   Butler &amp; Binion said it will provide free phone
connections to Washington for Texans seeking information
about relatives in Kuwait and Iraq.
   The firm's philanthropy was inspired by "reports of people
who were running up $600 phone bills calling numbers in
Washington trying to get information," the firm said.
   Associate Stephanie Harrison, acting as a spokeswoman for
the law firm, said the service will utilize Butler &amp; Binion's
tie lines connecting its Texas offices to its Washington
office.
   Texans can dial an 800 number and have a Butler &amp; Binion
operator connect them to a dial tone in Washington.
   "Service will continue until the State Department
inaugurates its own 800 service or until the crisis is over,"
the law firm said.

   Nurses Shift to Taking Care of Business

   NEW YORK -- Thousands of nurses in the U.S., fed up with
low pay, long hours and arrogant doctors, are setting up
their own businesses.
   For Corrie Brouwer, single mother of five, the moment of
truth came when she got her tax forms. "I was working 75 or
80 hours a week as a staff nurse and coming up with $50,000 a
year. It was ridiculous." Her frustration grew when she was
asked to keep an eye on temporary nurses supplied by agencies
who earned more than she did. The final straw was a tax bill
of $20,000. "I asked myself: Is this what I have to look
forward to?" she recalls.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It wasn't. In March of 1988, she and fellow nurse Mary
Pawar set up Critical Difference Inc. in Fairfield, N.J.,
that they say places "elite" nurses in hospitals. It had
revenue of $1 million in its first year and $1.4 million in
the second year. Now, the partners plan to set up a second
company, Critical Connection, that will provide medical
services in patients' homes. They are confident they will
have no problems finding skilled nurses willing to leave
hospital employment to join their pool of independent
contractors. "Nurses working more than five years have had it
with the hospital politics and low pay," says Mrs. Pawar.
"There are too many avenues open to them."
   Mrs. Pawar and Mrs. Brouwer are among a growing number of
nurse entrepreneurs in this country. Not so many years ago,
nurses were sometimes expected to stand if a doctor entered a
room. Today, they may walk out of hospital wards into
businesses of their own instead. Many establish
nursing-placement agencies or set up their own practices, but
the list of specialties is almost endless, and includes
pharmaceutical distribution, day care for the aged,
performance reviews of hospitals and mobile dialysis.
Collectively, they are helping to change the face of health
care in America.
   "The whole decade of the 1980s was entrepreneurial, and
now nurses are following suit," says David Norris, head of
the National Nurses in Business Association of Petaluma,
Calif. He estimates the number of nurses who have established
their own businesses doubled in the past decade, to 20,000.
Membership of his own association has shot up to 700 from 200
when it got started two years ago, he says.
   Another group that is growing fast is the American
Association of Nurse Attorneys. Set up in 1982, it now has
more than 500 members. Typically, they chose a second career
in law out of frustration at the limited advancement
opportunities of their original profession. Its treasurer,
Karen Guarino, one of 15 attorneys in the healthlaw
department of Ober, Kaler, Grimes &amp; Shriver of Baltimore, had
risen in the nursing ranks and opened a medical-oncology unit
in a general hospital in Houston. Despite her success, she
grew restless.
   "In nursing, you begin to repeat yourself, and I wanted to
grow," she says. She remembers "standing at my kitchen sink
thinking, what am I going to do now?"
   Sheer exhaustion does some nurses in. Laura Gasparis
Vonfrolio returned home from one of two nursing jobs a few
years back and wondered whether "I was ever going to see my
name in lights." Impulsively, she fired off letters to two
brokerage firms she picked at random, calling herself the
president of CPR Associates and offering to train their
employees in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   Two weeks later, she got a call from someone identifying
herself as Merrill Lynch. Her first thought: "Why would any
mother name her kid Merrill?" Then the woman asked if she
could start classes for 545 people as soon as possible. She
managed to organize classes within three weeks and netted
$2,000 in five days. "I've been in business ever since," she
says.
   Mrs. Gasparis Vonfrolio has started several other
ventures, including Education Enterprises Inc., which
organizes seminars, and a publication company that is
assembling a book of essays covering nurses' grievances
against their profession.
   The exodus of nurses to entrepreneurship worries the
medical establishment, already coping with a severe national
shortage of working nurses. But some nurse entrepreneurs
claim their activities are easing the shortage, which leaves
one in 10 hospital vacancies unfilled. Nurse-owned placement
agencies, for example, which offer higher pay and more
flexible scheduling than staff jobs while skipping fringe
benefits, are luring back some of the roughly 400,000 nurses
-- one in five of the total -- who have left the work force.
   Says Pamela Maraldo, executive director of the National
League for Nursing, based in New York: "Hospitals are being
overused and we don't have enough health care in the home.
That's where nurses come in. They see people's needs aren't
being met and they set up businesses to meet them.
Physicians' days of sovereignty are over."
   Nurses often find that one business spawns another. Five
years ago, Lannie Liggett was hired by a fellow nurse,
William Borne, to help expand a provisional staffing agency
for health-care facilities, Analytical Medical Enterprises,
in Baton Rouge, La. Already, they have set up 24 regional
offices in 12 states, and this year expect revenues to
approach $20 million.
   But the pair didn't stop there. They have launched eight
affiliated businesses, including a contract-anesthesia
company, an office-management company for physicians and a
traveling-nurse company. The most unusual venture is a
Cajun-food catering service that got started when the company
agreed to handle a party as a publicity stunt and then
couldn't find an affordable caterer. That offshoot has
produced its own offshoot, a seafood processing factory.
   Meanwhile, the proliferation of medical-malpractice and
product-liability lawsuits has given rise to liability-advice
firms. Doreen Wise says revenue at her Medical Research
Consultants in Houston, which does research for attorneys'
personal-injury and malpractice cases, has doubled every year
for four years, hitting $600,000 last year. Though much of
her business comes from plaintiff lawyers, she figures her
expertise helps keep their clients' legal fees down.
   "We have lots of doctors who work with us who would never
have anything to do with most lawyers," she says. "We're
trading on our clinical experience."
   While many nurses gripe about working conditions,
dissatisfaction of another kind gnawed at operating-room
nurse Nancy Gorski. "I was upset by some of the things I was
seeing," she says. For example, she says, she was "horrified"
that some anesthesiologists merely rinsed off the blades of
laryngoscopes that are inserted into patients' mouths. Even
scrubbing the devices doesn't kill all the germs, but
sterilizing the blades can ruin them, she says.
   Ms. Gorski set up a research-and-development firm in
Camarillo, Calif., called Gorsk Inc. to come up with
infection-control products. It recently licensed the patent
for a disposable latex sheath for the laryngoscope blades. It
is also in the final stages of negotiating licensing rights
to a multinational corporation for special receptacles for
sponges used during surgery, she says.
   To be sure, the great majority of nurses still work as
employees of hospitals, nursing homes and other institutions.
Many love the work. The pay is getting better, with average
maximum salaries for staff nurses rising 9.9% last year to
$35,300. Enrollments at nursing schools, which slumped to
183,000 in 1987 from a peak of 251,000 in 1983, are picking
up, increasing 8.9% last year to 201,000. And many hospitals
are trying to increase opportunities for nurses.
   One statistic remains stubbornly unfavorable, however: the
"salary progression" that measures the difference between an
occupation's average starting salary and average maximum
salary. For accountants, the progression is 209%, for
attorneys, 226%, and for engineers, 184%. For nurses, it is
69%. "I had dead-ended salary-wise at age 27," says Gail
Wick. "My motivation wasn't money-oriented, but still, this
was a dismal thought." She left her career in nursing and
went on to establish Gail Wick &amp; Associates, a consulting and
placement firm in Atlanta.

   ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- Gelman Sciences Inc. said it
anticipates that it will report a loss of approximately $1.5
million for its fiscal year ended July 31.
   The health-devices company had net income of $2.1 million,
or 98 cents a share, on sales of $71.1 million, for its
fiscal year ended in 1989. Net sales for 1990 were
approximately $73 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gelman said financial results for fiscal 1990 were hurt by
lower-than-planned sales, poor performance of the company's
Australian subsidiary, and higher-than-anticipated expenses
in Gelman Sciences Sunbeam Process operations and year-end
adjustments.
   The company expects to release year-end results in late
September.

   Newt Gingrich
   Fights Against
   The Axis Powers

   Saddam Hussein has brought the lion out of George Bush on
foreign policy. Newt Gingrich hopes he'll start roaring on
the homefront too.
   In the Mideast, Mr. Bush has his goals straight and his
strategy clear. Back home, things are a mess. Stocks and
bonds are falling, the economy's stalled and the dollar is as
weak as the Kuwaiti emir. The White House goal of a
tax-raising deficit-reduction deal looks beside the point, if
not dangerous. This is no way to fight a war.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gingrich, the number-two Republican in the House, is
the cavalry riding to the rescue. Instead of higher taxes,
he's putting together a package of tax cuts to abort a
recession. As for the deficit, he wants the president to
finally get tough on spending. "The world that existed at the
beginning of the budget summit is over," says the man some
Democrats consider the domestic Saddam Hussein.
   Mr. Gingrich may seem a lonely partisan, but he actually
reflects a much broader unhappiness with White House economic
policy. It's the tip of an iceberg that cuts through much of
the Cabinet, the Federal Reserve, Republicans in Congress,
even parts of the White House. Before going public, Mr.
Gingrich spent days calling around the administration to
sample opinion, try out ideas. He was startled by the support
he found.
   By breaking ranks publicly, Mr. Gingrich is nonetheless
taking a risk. As a budget summiteer he wants to be loyal to
George Bush, but also show him there's a policy alternative.
He isn't yet walking out of the summit, merely putting
different ideas on the table. He wants to attract Mr. Bush,
not fight him.
   His real fight is with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
and Budget Director Richard Darman, the twin peaks of Bush
economic policy. The pair told the president that if he
played his ace -- the no-new-tax pledge -- a deficit deal
with Democrats would follow. But Democrats pocketed the card
and raised the ante. They're dumbstruck that Republicans have
been such patsies. Mr. Darman has believed that only
bipartisan good-feeling can produce the grand deal he's
longed for; he hasn't delivered.
   On economic substance, the Brady-Darman axis has muted
calls for a capital gains tax cut, but shouted for easier
money. Mr. Brady's recent Fed-bashing -- timed just when oil
was shooting into the mid-$20s-a-barrel -- has unsettled even
some who think the Fed's been too tight in the past. Mr.
Gingrich calls this the "Hoover-Carter technique."
   The Georgian hopes to persuade Mr. Bush that Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell "is not Hosni Mubarak" -- the
Egyptian president and now U.S. ally. Mr. Mitchell, he says,
"gets up every morning thinking, `How can I defeat George
Bush today.'" Mr. Bush, a trusting man, has a hard time
believing Democrats can be so implacable.
   Mr. Gingrich says Republicans have to start playing
offense. Veto fat spending bills. Let the Gramm-Rudman budget
sword fall, at least at first. Brady-Darman will insist that
with the crisis in Iraq, this is no time to be tough at home.
But with the president's popularity so high, now is exactly
the time to demand spending discipline: Guns or butter, but
not both. Mr. Bush's press conference last week was a start,
but Democrats and the press think it's only a phony war. They
won't negotiate seriously until they see the tanks deployed
on their border.
   Understandably, the Brady-Darman axis frowns on Mr.
Gingrich. After the Georgian criticized their strategy on
"Meet the Press" on July 29, he was privately rebuked by Mr.
Brady. When he attacked Democrats the following week, senior
officials backgrounded reporters that Mr. Gingrich "was not
constructive." This week, Messrs. Darman and Gingrich have
had what one aide euphemistically calls "candid" talks. Mr.
Darman persuaded him to drop support for a cut in the Social
Security payroll tax, but not for other tax cuts.
   Brady-Darman know they can still count on the loyalty of
most GOP budget summiteers. Congressional leaders Bob Dole
and Bob Michel are stalwart for higher taxes. Others are
watching Mr. Gingrich, but keeping their distance. Even one
natural ally, Texas conservative Sen. Phil Gramm, says he
still wants a budget deal.
   "I don't want higher taxes," Mr. Gramm said this week.
"But the American people elected Democrats, and that's their
price for spending cuts. Maybe this is a good civics lesson."
Not to mention an expensive one. The irony is that Mr. Gramm
is a summiteer in part because of Mr. Gingrich; the Georgian
told the White House he wouldn't even participate in the
summit unless Mr. Gramm was also invited.
   So the Gingrich effort is a long shot, but consider this
scenario: A budget deal goes to Congress, and the leadership
is urging members to vote for higher taxes with only token
spending cuts. Mr. Gingrich, backed by 90 or so Republicans,
is offering the alternative of real spending cuts and lower
taxes. How many Democrats, preparing for November elections,
will begin to get cold feet? "I think it would be very, very
close," says Mr. Gingrich.
   Skeptics might also consider this: Those who say Mr.
Gingrich can't win now are the same people who said he'd
never depose a speaker of the House, and never win election
as House GOP whip, either.

   Jordan Is Training the Iraqis
   On U.S. Missiles, Israel Says

   JERUSALEM -- Jordanian military officers have been
training Iraqi troops to operate U.S.-made Hawk anti-aircraft
missiles captured from Kuwait, government military sources
here say.
   Because of the training, U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf
may be forced to fight against Hawks and other advanced
U.S.-made weaponry, which Israeli experts believe the Iraqi
troops would have been unable to operate without assistance.
Both the radar tracking system and the method for reloading
the Hawk missile are considered too complex to master without
instruction.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Omar Rifai, first secretary of the Jordanian Embassy in
Washington denied that his country is training Iraqis to use
the anti-aircraft missiles. "There's no truth to these
reports," he said. "They're completely unfounded."
   Despite the politically charged situation in the Gulf, the
Jordanians -- who have been calling for a peaceful,
negotiated settlement -- have taught the Iraqi officers how
to use the Hawks "on an ongoing basis," an Israeli military
source said yesterday. "So now," he said, "U.S. troops will
have to face their own U.S.-made weapons, captured by the
Iraqis in Kuwait."
   Israeli officials are anxious to point out the risks of
U.S. weaponry falling into unfriendly hands right now, since
they are trying to make a case against the U.S.'s plans to
supply Saudi Arabia with its most sophisticated fighter
planes.
   "Too many times it seems that when the Americans give or
sell an ally weapons, they fall into the hands of a U.S.
enemy," commented Gerald Steinberg, a military analyst at
Israel's Bar Ilan University. "It happened with the fall of
the shah in Iran in 1979, with Vietnam in 1975, and now
here."
   A Pentagon spokesman declined to comment on the reports.
   In return for the training, Iraq has given Jordan
Western-made spare military parts -- also captured from
Kuwait -- for which Iraq has no use, Israeli military sources
believe.
   Joseph Alpher, deputy head of the Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University, said yesterday that
since 1977 the U.S. had supplied Kuwait a total of four
batteries of MIM 23B Improved Hawk ground-to-air
anti-aircraft missiles. Each battery contains three or four
mobile launchers, which means that if the Iraqi army captured
all of them, it would now have the ability to fire 12 to 16
Hawk missiles at a time. While the Hawks were new to the
Iraqis, Jordan already had at least 14 batteries of the same
kind of Hawks, Mr. Alpher said. Jordan got its first Hawks
from the U.S. in 1976.
   In addition to the Hawk anti-aircraft missiles, Kuwait
also had in its arsenal 30 U.S.-made Skyhawk bombers, an
unknown number of U.S.-made air-to-air Sidewinder missiles,
and 500 armored personnel carriers, many of them U.S.-made
M113s. Along with these sophisticated U.S. weapons, Kuwait
had Soviet hand-held missiles; French Exocet, Magique, Matra
and HOT missiles; 30 French Mirage F-1 planes; and a number
of other Soviet- and Egyptian-made weapons.
   Although Jordan and Iraq have developed close military
ties over the past year and a half, Mr. Steinberg commented
that "Jordan's training Iraq how to use the Hawks adds a new
dimension" to the relationship at a particularly delicate
moment.
   But he noted that because the cooperative ties between the
two countries already existed, "the infrastructure was
already there. An institutional momentum had already begun.
It would have been a political decision for Jordan to stop"
the cooperation at this point, Mr. Steinberg said.
   Israeli military sources were unsure when the Jordanians
began advising the Iraqis on using Hawk missiles, but they
say it is possible that the training had been going on for
some time, using Amman's supply of missiles, before Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. In any event, the Israeli sources
assume the training is continuing.
   With Iraq's Saddam Hussein wildly popular among the 60% of
Jordan's population who are Palestinian, Jordan's King
Hussein has been trying to walk a political tightrope between
Iraq and his longstanding alliance with the U.S. Israeli
experts believe he may have felt too politically threatened
at home to turn down Saddam Hussein's request for continued
military training.
   Jordan began to escalate its military cooperation with
Iraq about a year and a half ago, Israeli experts believe.
Too economically strapped to pay for all its own training,
Jordan began to join forces with Iraq. The two countries
began to conduct joint overflights near the Israeli border,
and also to conduct joint ground maneuvers. And a large
number of senior Iraqi field commanders reconnoitered the
Israel-Jordan border. The Iraqis and Jordanians currently are
operating radar in Jordan aimed at Israel, said an Israeli
intelligence expert on Iraq.
   "Given this level of cooperation," said Mr. Alpher, "it's
not surprising that the Jordanians would provide the Hawk
training."

   Workplace:
   Fears for Careers Curb Paternity Leaves

   Like a growing number of employers, Cray Research Inc.
offers family leave for dads who want to take time off after
their new baby is born. So how many of Cray's 4,000 employees
have taken paternity leave since the firm adopted the policy
last year? No more than four.
   "The notion of taking six months off might be good for
your sanity, but it's absolutely fatal to your career," says
William Linder-Scholer, 45-year-old director of community
affairs at Cray, a supercomputer maker based in Minneapolis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   When his daughter, Laura, was born 18 months ago, Mr.
Linder-Scholer turned down a 10-week unpaid leave in favor of
a one-week vacation. "No CEO would ever speak out against
family leave. It's subtle, unspoken, never in print -- it's
just the way the game is played. If you're in an environment
where the nature of the business is chaotic, you just can't
afford to be gone if you want to be a player," he says.
   More dads may be changing diapers than a decade ago, but
that doesn't mean they are taking time off from work to do
it, even when they can. Money is one reason. Most husbands
earn more than their wives, and they often can't afford even
a temporary loss of that paycheck. Stereotypes also play a
role -- many people believe child rearing is a woman's job.
   But fear of career consequences is often the greatest
concern -- even though leave takers are usually guaranteed
the same job when they return. Peer pressure helps perpetuate
the belief that paternity leaves unfairly burden co-workers
with extra assignments. And many men hoping to move up in
management fear that a leave would hinder or eliminate their
chances. "Many men aren't convinced that they wouldn't be
penalized for that opportunity," says Gordon Collins, a
psychology professor at the College of Wooster in Ohio.
   The failure of most fathers to take advantage of paternity
leave is ironic, given the heated debate over the issue.
Recently, President Bush was criticized by proponents of
leaves for vetoing a bill that would have guaranteed workers
up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption or
family illness. For his objection, Mr. Bush cited fierce
global economic competition.
   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 18% of U.S.
employees at companies and organizations with 100 employees
or more were offered unpaid paternity leave in 1989 and
another 1% could take paid leave.
   While no statistics are available, companies that offer
paternity leave say few men take it. At Campbell Soup Co.'s
headquarters in Camden, N.J., not a single employee has taken
paternity leave in the three years since the food company
began offering a three-month unpaid benefit. At Unum Corp., a
Portland, Maine, insurer, only one man has taken paternity
leave in the past five years (although the benefit has been
offered since 1978) -- while 250 women took maternity leave
in that time. Moreover, that one father's leave was only two
weeks long, although the insurance concern allows 12 weeks of
unpaid leave. Unum says about 25 men inquired about the leave
in those five years but decided against it upon learning it
is unpaid.
   Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal in
New York, has offered a four-month unpaid paternity leave for
three years and recently extended it to six months. But it
said fewer than 10 men have taken the leave, while more than
200 women took a parental leave.
   Dan Borgenheimer, 30, a senior process engineer at
Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co., contends that paternity
leaves are "disruptive" to the workplace. "There's even some
resentment when women take off. We have to split their
workload among all the remaining people, and we're already
busy as it is," he says. Mr. Borgenheimer, who also insists
on using his vacation time when he is ill rather than taking
sick days, took off only one vacation day when his first
child, Sarah, was born four years ago.
   Since Minnesota Mining, a St. Paul, Minn., maker of
adhesives and other products, began offering the benefit in
1986, more than 85 men have taken the two-month unpaid
parental leave, out of a domestic, male-dominated work force
of about 50,000. About 1,200 women took the leave in the same
period.
   Minnesota Mining says its culture of flexibility may
account for the leave's unusual popularity. "We don't have a
real stringent system or yes-no policy on {time off}," says
Mary Auvin, a company spokeswoman. Instead, "we try to work
things out rather than lose somebody we've already trained."
She also attributed the number of men taking advantage of the
benefit to the state's 1987 parental-leave law, which
requires concerns to offer men and women six weeks of unpaid
leave.
   For Michael Harens, a systems analyst at Prudential
Insurance Co. of America, paternity leave "wasn't even a
consideration" when his daughter, Jacqueline, was born 14
months ago -- even though Prudential offers a six-month
unpaid paternity leave. The Newark, N.J.-based company
couldn't say how many men have taken the leave since it was
first offered about 10 years ago.
   Mr. Harens, fearing snickers from the management,
encouraged his wife, Mary, a legal consultant, to take a
three-month leave instead. "I think it's still socially
unacceptable," says Mr. Harens, 31. "The stigma is still
there. It's not so much that a man couldn't handle it, but
that" society says a man shouldn't do it, he says. "I don't
think we even talked about him taking a leave. It was just
assumed that I would stay home," adds Mrs. Harens, 32. A man
staying home to change diapers instead of work is "sort of
looked down upon."
   Mr. Collins, the psychologist from the College of Wooster,
explains, "We haven't escaped the notion that house-husbands
are, to a certain degree, wimpier than persons who are not."
   Mr. Harens insists he is "leaps and bounds" more active in
the upbringing of his children than his father was. "My
father had seven children and never changed a diaper," he
says.
   Some people question the idea of a man, who has been
through no physical hardship, staying home with a baby while
his wife, who has been through months of physical strain,
goes back to work. "It's a controversial issue but I say, why
does the man need time off? We recommend that the woman stay
home because her body needs to recover. There's really no
need for him to be there unless she's sick and needs help,"
says Pearline Gilpin, a nurse midwife and Lamaze class
instructor at Meharry Medical College's Hubbard Hospital in
Nashville, Tenn.
   Indeed, Deidre Demorest, a part-time family counselor and
graduate student in Santa Clara, Calif., says she and her
husband, Michael Brown, would have "just gotten on each
others' nerves" had they both taken a leave. Ms. Demorest,
31, took 14 weeks off from work to recover from a Caesarean
section last January while Mr. Brown took one week of
vacation.
   Mr. Brown, 35, a financial analyst at aerospace concern
Lockheed Corp., bypassed the option of a six-month unpaid
personal leave of absence because the couple couldn't afford
it, he isn't a "stay-at-home kind of person," and because
"he's not as into being with {Sean} as I am," explains Ms.
Demorest.
   Money was the major factor when Patricio Rojas's baby,
Monica, was born nine months ago. Mr. Rojas took only a
one-week vacation to help his wife, Anne, recover. "I thought
long and hard about it and basically . . . we can't make it
on just {my wife's} salary," says Mr. Rojas, a senior
automated design engineer at Unisys Corp., a computer and
business systems concern. Unisys, based in Blue Bell, Pa.,
offers a nonpaid personal leave for employees that can be
used for paternity leave. Mr. Rojas says he wishes he could
have afforded a leave, because "my baby is more important
than my career."
   Some couples compromise on paternity leave by having the
husband work at home while the wife recovers. Louis Hook,
director of finance for a division of the University of
California in Los Angeles, managed his 12 employees out of
his home last January while bathing, feeding and changing the
twin son, Randall or Carlton, "assigned" to him. Meanwhile,
Mrs. Hook recovered from her Caesarean and watched over the
other baby.
   "I think {Louis} was excited about being home. He realized
that once he returned to work, he wouldn't have the
opportunity to spend that kind of time with them again,
except on the weekends," says Mrs. Hook.

   Arafat's Iraq Debacle

   Yasser Arafat carries a revolver to show his commitment to
armed struggle. Every once and a while he pulls out the gun
and shoots himself in the foot.
   As the disastrous consequences of Mr. Arafat's support for
Iraq's conquest of Kuwait became clear, Palestinians and PLO
officials are having a major debate. Jawad al-Ghusayn who, as
chairman of the Palestine National Fund is seeing Saudi and
Kuwaiti contributions vanish, called Iraq's occupation
"illegal" and claims the PLO has always backed Kuwait.
Similarly, Palestinian super-hardliners based in Syria are
supporting Damascus's anti-Iraq position.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After four days of hot crisis meetings, the PLO came up
with a new and confusing position Sunday. The PLO proposed an
"Arab solution" to the crisis and that any foreign military
forces in the region be put under a UN flag.
   Gulf Arabs are not impressed with this "neutral" stance. A
Saudi diplomat asked how the PLO could do nothing when "a
giant is murdering a little child." Exiled Kuwaitis asked Mr.
Arafat in an open letter, "don't you remember how many years
you spent in Kuwait and the continuous Kuwaiti contributions
and support to the Palestinian revolution?"
   Already having their own states, non-Palestinian Arabs
fear the precedent Iraq is setting by grabbing Kuwait. Cheers
for Baghdad have come almost exclusively from Palestinians,
who also furnish much of the pro-Iraq, anti-American
atmosphere that CBS news cameras recorded in Jordan.
   How did the PLO get into this bog? Last spring Mr. Arafat
made a strategic decision to switch patrons, from Egypt to
Iraq. He resented Cairo's nagging to moderate the PLO and
make a peace with Israel. A PLO leaflet issued the day before
Iraq's invasion called Egypt an American "puppet" and "an
obedient tool in the hands of the American administration."
   Mr. Arafat apparently saw Saddam Hussein as the region's
new strongman. At the Baghdad Arab summit last May he said,
"we declare our support for Iraq," whose missiles and
chemical weapons provided the Arabs with the strategic parity
"to achieve liberation from Baghdad to Jerusalem and from
al-Faw {the southern tip of Iraq} to Gaza."
   When the Iraq-sponsored Palestine Liberation Front (PLF)
launched a terrorist assault on Israel's beaches that same
month, Mr. Arafat defied American blandishments and refused
to renounce the attack: He preferred losing the U.S.-PLO
dialogue to criticizing the PLF and angering his new patron
in Baghdad. Now PLF leader Muhammad Abu al-Abbas calls for
terrorist attacks on American targets to help Iraq: "Strike
with your long arms at all U.S. interests. Open fire at the
enemies of our nation everywhere."
   Palestinians, frustrated at the inability of the
"intifada" to make political gains, are now seeking an
outside liberator. Yet their experience in the 1950s and '60s
with Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, a far more popular and
charismatic figure than Saddam Hussein, gained them nothing.
As an Arab writer put it, "God save this nation from its
heroes]"
   Palestinians' adulation for Saddam also reveals a
widespread feeling among them that Mr. Arafat has failed. A
West Bank Palestinian referred to Iraq's leader as "the Arab
Bismarck." Bismarck unified the German states into one
empire: If Palestine is to be a province in an Iraq-dominated
Middle East, then the separate Palestinian nationalism
represented by the PLO has no place.
   In today's Arab world, only the Palestinians' collective
interest calls for Pan-Arabism. The other Arab countries are
increasingly preoccupied with their own state's needs. Saddam
seized Kuwait's loot for Iraq's benefit, Saudi Arabia called
in U.S. help to protect its independence, Egypt and Syria
acted in their own national interests to oppose Baghdad's bid
for regional domination. As Arab states seek their own
advantage more and more frankly, and pay less and less homage
to Pan-Arabism, the PLO and Palestinian cause can expect to
enjoy less and less aid or diplomatic leverage.
   Iraq's aggression pulls the rug from under the intifada.
Kuwait supported the PLO and West Bank Palestinians through
grants from the Kuwaiti treasury, a Kuwaiti-administered tax
on the 300,000 Palestinians in Kuwait and the private
remittances from Palestinians in Kuwait to relatives on the
West Bank and elsewhere. This link will now be broken.
Kuwait's government-in-exile has cut off its subsidies to the
PLO. Meanwhile, Palestinians are being fired and expelled
from sheikdoms up and down the Gulf because they are feared
as a potential fifth column. On the West Bank, where living
standards have already been cut in half by the uprising, the
loss of the Gulf's assistance will be devastating.
   The harm that Mr. Arafat has done the PLO by backing
Saddam goes beyond the financial. Arab newspapers have noted
that Mr. Arafat, who opposes the seizing of land by force and
the denial of self-determination in the West Bank and Gaza,
seems to favor it in the Gulf. Al-Ahram, Egypt's leading
newspaper, called Mr. Arafat's embrace of Saddam
"prostration" before the man who plunged "his poisoned dagger
in the Arabs' back."
   The discrediting of the Palestinian cause is likely to be
long-lasting. It is not likely that if and when this crisis
ends the Arab states -- who will have just finished begging
the U.S. to save them from Iraq -- will press for concessions
to the PLO, which sided with their enemy. America's principal
Arab allies -- Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and even Syria --
will hardly feel like doing Arafat a favor.
   Nor will Mr. Arafat gain much from his new alliance, even
if Saddam survives this confrontation. Iraq will be a far
less tolerant patron than Egypt and a far less generous
paymaster than the Gulf states have been. It will press the
PLO, or at least PLO member groups, to step up terrorist
activities on Iraq's behalf, further undermining the PLO's
image. Saddam certainly has no interest in restarting an
Arab-Israel peace process or fostering a U.S.-PLO
rapprochement.
   The PLO is unlikely to split and less likely to disappear.
Ordinary Palestinians, though, will have to decide whether to
blame their continued frustration on Mr. Arafat or the U.S.
Either way, Mr. Arafat's bet on Saddam has destroyed any
immediate prospect for improving their situation.

   Murdoch's News Corp. Raises Valuation
   Of Assets, Posts Higher Operating Profit

   SYDNEY, Australia -- Media mogul Rupert Murdoch surprised
investors by substantially marking up the valuations on many
of his far-flung News Corp. assets and reporting a higher
annual operating profit than had been widely expected.
   News Corp. said it has revalued its publications and
television licenses upward by about three billion Australian
dollars (US$2.46 billion). That is three times bigger than
analysts had expected. And the company's debt-to-equity
ratio, although lower as a result, still suggests that debt
levels are even higher than some News Corp. watchers thought.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   News Corp. also announced that its operating profit after
tax but before extraordinary items fell by 43% to A$282.3
million, or A$1.02 a share, in the year ended June 30 from
A$496.5 million, or A$1.58 a share, a year earlier. Analysts'
estimates had ranged between A$215 million and A$250 million.
   After extraordinary items, News Corp.'s profit fell 71% to
A$343.3 million, or A$1.21 a share, from A$1.16 billion, or
A$3.52 a share. The dividend is maintained at 10 Australian
cents a share.
   Revenue rose 12% to A$8.76 billion from A$7.81 billion.
   Asset revaluation is an exercise News Corp. undertakes
every three years. In previous years, the company has used it
as a tool to increase its borrowing power by boosting its
shareholders' equity. But Mr. Murdoch has said the debt-laden
company won't be pursuing its usual agressive acquisition
strategy, so News Corp. watchers were looking for the company
to use the latest revaluation more as a defensive tactic to
make its balance sheet look stronger.
   Under Australian accounting rules, the company can
periodically write up the value of certain assets if News
Corp. directors think they are worth more than the purchase
price. But the company doesn't have to provide a breakdown of
what assets were written up -- or marked down. A News Corp.
official said in a telephone interview Thursday that "we
don't discuss which {assets} went up or down." He also
declined to disclose News Corp.'s current debt levels,
although those figures will be released when the company
publishes its annual accounts next month.
   The last time News Corp. revalued its assets was in 1987,
when it added about A$1 billion to its asset valuations.
According to the 1989 accounts, News Corp. valued its
publishing rights, titles and television licenses at A$8.85
billion. The latest increase, based on independent
valuations, will boost that figure by about a third.
   The size of the latest write-up startled several analysts,
some of whom had expected soft advertising markets in the
U.S. and U.K. to force News Corp. to write down the values of
certain assets, thus limiting the overall mark-up.
   George Batsakis, an analyst at Melbourne stockbrokerage
firm J.B Were &amp; Son, said that while there appeared to be
much scope to revalue certain News Corp. assets, he "didn't
think it could be above A$2 billion."
   Viktor Shvets, who tracks News Corp. in Sydney for Baring
Securities (Australia) Ltd., had expected a total asset
write-up of about A$1 billion. The huge revaluation is
"clearly positive" for the company because it improves its
debt-to-equity ratios, he said. But, "by the same token, it
highlights {the company's} debt levels," which apparently are
higher than some analysts had estimated.
   Even after the sharp revaluation, News Corp.'s
debt-to-equity ratio is still 0.90-to-1. While that is well
below the 1.1-to-1 that News Corp.'s bank lenders stipulate
must exist every year on June 30 -- and below the 0.98-to-1
that the company reported for June 30, 1989 -- analysts said
it suggests that News Corp.'s debts have swelled.
   According to analysts' estimates, the debt-to-equity ratio
News Corp. disclosed Thursday suggests the company is
calculating its equity at A$10.5 billion, including an
estimated A$1.3 billion in preference shares and A$1.2
billion in convertible notes that the company counts as
equity. Its debt, then, is about A$9.45 billion. That's about
$500 million more than Baring Securities had estimated. And
to put the debt figure into perspective, it is about as much
as Uruguay owes its international creditors.
   News Corp. has been jettisoning assets to cut its debt
load, but the News Corp. official said the company plans "no
major asset sales" during the current fiscal year.
   News Corp. said it ended fiscal 1990 with net tangible
asset backing of A$27.91 a share, including convertible notes
and U.K. special-dividend shares. That is up from A$15.20 a
share a year earlier. Yet, News Corp. shares are trading at a
substantial discount. They closed yesterday on Australian
stock exchanges at A$10.40 each, down from A$10.80 on
Wednesday.
   Analysts also noted that the latest year's profits were
buoyed by certain accounting changes, including the way News
Corp. treated losses on Sky Television, its fledgling British
satellite-TV service.
   A net extraordinary gain of A$61 million included profits
from the sale of the Star magazine in the U.S. and the
spinoff of 49% of the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong,
offset in part by a write-off of previously capitalized
development costs at Sky TV and a provision against
investments and obsolete equipment.
   The profit drop was blamed on initial losses at Sky TV;
substantially lower earnings at Ansett Airlines, a 50%-owned
Australian domestic carrier, that suffered from an
industrywide pilots' strike, and increased interest costs.
   News Corp. said it earned "a significant first-time
operating profit" at Fox Broadcasting Co., its U.S. national
programming service. Fox Broadcasting achieved a 27% increase
in its prime-time household ratings.
   The Twentieth Century Fox Film division result declined,
though. "Fox Film has developed a strong schedule for the
1991 financial year and is encouraged by the initial
box-office acceptance of `Die Hard 2,' which has already
grossed in excess of U.S. $100 million," the company said.
   TV Guide magazine "performed satisfactorily and its
results exceeded budget expectations," News Corp. said.
   Operating profit at the company's British newspapers was
"slightly below" that of the previous fiscal year. Results
were affected by reduced advertising volumes and the entry of
new competitors.

   If some environmentalists have their way, the decision to
have a tooth filled may soon require people to grapple with
decisions of a much larger order, such as their burial plans.
According to a recent report in Nature magazine, the
increasing use of cremation poses environmental problems
related to fillings.
   It seems the crematoria heat causes the dental amalgams to
release harmful mercury vapor in the air. Getting yourself
and your fillings buried in the ground, on the other hand,
would be relatively harmless, argues Dr. Allan Mills, the
author of this study. While investigators have been
preoccupied with the dangers that amalgam materials might
pose to patients, Dr. Mills notes, "none of the investigators
seems to have considered the nature of the final disposal of
the teeth and their owners."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We'd bet that a whole lot of people haven't been thinking
much about this particular disposal problem, but concerned
environmentalists needn't worry. They can either opt for
burial in the ground or, if they insist on cremation, they
can consider Dr. Mills's suggestion that their filled teeth
be extracted and safely disposed of. How and when these
extractions are to take place, Dr. Mills does not say. Will
dentists be rushed to the deathbed to remove fillings, as
family members gather round for this final gesture toward the
environment? Will Medicare pick up the costs? These questions
have yet to be answered.

   Shell Oil Co. Fire
   At Texas Refinery
   Lifts Prices Faster

   HOUSTON -- Shell Oil Co. said a fire at its Deer Park,
Texas, refinery injured two workers and closed a large
portion of the plant, causing already rising gasoline prices
to climb faster.
   With gasoline supplies tight and the market extremely edgy
because of the potential for war in the Middle East, any
supply disruption, even short term, can have impact. "It's
bad news," said Thomas Manning, a vice president at refining
consultants Purvin &amp; Gertz Inc.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In addition, U.S. refiners have been producing gasoline,
heating oil and other petroleum products at full capacity, a
situation that has sparked a flurry of accidents and could
cause more. "The harder you run something, the more likely a
fire is," Mr. Manning said. "They seem to run in bunches."
   Indeed, Crown Central Petroleum Corp. said a critical
portion of its Houston refinery developed a leak yesterday
and was shut down. The petroleum products markets are so on
edge that rumors flew among traders that other refineries
across the country had operating difficulties.
   The Shell accident, at a 215,000 barrel-a-day capacity
refinery along the Houston Ship Channel, occurred in a large
distillation unit. A spokesman for the company, a unit of
Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said the fire started yesterday
morning, but he didn't know the cause. One Shell worker was
flown to a nearby hospital with first-degree and
second-degree burns, and another was treated at the plant,
the spokesman said.
   The fire was burning as of yesterday afternoon, but Shell
expected that it would burn itself out by the end of the day,
the spokesman said. He said it was too early to assess how
long the distillation unit, which processes 165,000 barrels a
day of crude oil, would be out.
   The distillation unit is the first stage in processing
crude oil before sending it to other parts of the refinery.
Analysts said Shell can probably continue to produce gasoline
for a short time without the unit by processing so-called
intermediates it has in storage through the rest of the
plant.
   Shell has had a number of accidents and operating problems
in its refining system in the past few years. Last winter,
its plants had to shut down, triggered by an extraordinary
Gulf of Mexico freeze. And in May 1988, the company's Norco,
La., refinery exploded, killing seven workers and injuring
scores of others.

   Street Eager for Arbitration Superforum

   NEW YORK -- Awash in arbitration cases, Wall Street is
hoping to create a single forum in which small investors can
settle disputes with their brokers.
   The idea, which would consolidate the nation's 10
stock-market arbitration panels, is in its infancy. Few
details have been worked out. And with some regulators and
stock exchange officials expressing reservations about a
stand-alone arbitration body, the plan might never fly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the Street is certainly eager to corral its
arbitration caseload, which has doubled since 1986 to an
estimated 5,500 cases filed last year. Some brokerage
executives envision the new forum as a step toward banishing
a widely held perception that arbitration is stacked against
small investors.
   "The old-boy network, which may exist in certain places,
should not be as prevalent" with a single forum, said David
E. Robbins, a New York lawyer specializing in arbitration and
a former arbitration director at the American Stock Exchange.
   "But there really would be no change in perception," Mr.
Robbins said. A single forum, he said, "still would be
subsidized by the securities industry."
   Talk of such a forum has been around for years, and
recently has picked up steam. The Securities Industry
Conference on Arbitration, an ad hoc group that proposes
arbitration rules, will pick a consultant from among four
final bidders on Sept. 5 to come up with a firm plan and
study the feasibility. Officials of the National Association
of Securities Dealers are pushing for a quick proposal,
because the NASD shoulders by far the biggest slice of all
arbitration cases.
   Investors typically sign a standard agreement when they
open a brokerage account, binding them to accept arbitration
rather than file a lawsuit if a dispute arises. Investors can
bring cases against brokers to any of the 10 panels sponsored
by the securities industry. But the NASD and the New York
Stock Exchange handle 92% of all filings.
   A single forum wouldn't necessarily be a boon to small
investors. Fees for filing cases could jump because of the
costs of new facilities and computer systems, analysts said.
And any new arbitration body could be starved for resources,
because it wouldn't have the benefit of other exchange
business, facilities or personnel.
   Besides, Richard P. Ryder, editor of the Securities
Arbitration Commentator, a Maplewood, N.J., newsletter, said,
"Competition holds down prices a little better than
monopolies."
   One way investors stand to benefit: A single agency would
eliminate the subtle differences among various stock market
forums and their arbitrators. Some plaintiffs' lawyers
criticize the Big Board, for example, because they say its
arbitrators appear to be more biased toward the securities
industry -- a charge about which the the Big Board won't
comment.
   The New York exchange has reservations about a single
forum. "There are no means of registering it, no means of
funding it, no means of governing it," James E. Buck, a Big
Board senior vice president, said. The Big Board nevertheless
will participate in the study before judging the plan, he
said.
   The NASD is the plan's biggest backer, for good reason.
Even though many investor complaints don't involve securities
traded on its own system, the NASD winds up handling
two-thirds of all arbitration cases. (Many arbitration
agreements limit investors' choice of a forum to the NASD,
where investors last year won 54% of their cases, or to the
Big Board, where investors won about half the time.)
   Deborah Masucci, the NASD's director of arbitration,
characterized a single forum as "a more economic and
efficient way to handle disputes." Of course, she said, "We
have a vested interest."
   The Securities Industry Association has encouraged
discussion of the forum. "In theory, it sounds good, and
there should be economies of scale," William Fitzpatrick, the
trade group's general counsel and a member of the Securities
Industry Conference on Arbitration, said. The big concern is
funding. Unless a stand-alone forum is launched, the NASD and
others now shouldering the cost burden may eventually pull
back from the arbitration process, some specialists warned.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said it wants to
see a proposal before commenting on the plan. A few SEC
staffers worry that the new operation might have trouble
keeping high-quality arbitrators, because a stand-alone
organization is likely to be strapped for cash.
   Backers of the plan said it is gaining momentum. "Just the
fact that a panel is studying it means the sphinx has moved
an inch," Constantine N. Katsoris, professor of law at
Fordham University School of Law, said.

   For Worms, That Is

   Study Claims to Uncover Key
   To Aging in Nematode
   By Modifying Single Gene

   A Colorado scientist may have found the secret of long
life, a gene that appears to control aging.
   Unfortunately, the secret was unearthed in a tiny worm.
But, the scientist suggested, his experiments indicate that
it may be possible someday to modify the aging process in
other creatures, possibly including humans.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The experiment "says we're not stuck with it {aging} as it
is; it is a biological process that we can do something
about," said Thomas E. Johnson, a molecular geneticist with
the Institute for Behavioral Genetics at the University of
Colorado in Boulder.
   In this week's issue of Science, Mr. Johnson reports that
he succeeded in mutating a single gene and thereby doubling
the maximum life span of a group of standard laboratory
worms, creating what might be called the Methuselahs of the
annelid world.
   The initial experiment actually was carried out four years
ago, Mr. Johnson said in a telephone interview. But, he said,
he was so startled that a single gene mutation could have
such a dramatic affect on the worms' life span that he waited
until he could replicate the experiment before publishing his
finding. "We've now replicated it more than 200 times," he
said.
   The experiments were part of a broader study of the
genetic underpinnings of aging. The focus was on the maximum
life of the creatures if biological aging were the only cause
of death. This theoretical maximum life span is a calculation
based on the obvious fact that the older a group of creatures
grows the higher the death rate. The maximum life span is
calculated by a formula, known as the Gompertz equation, in
which one starts with the death rate of a species at puberty
and then determines how often the death rate doubles as the
creatures age.
   For humans, for example, the death rate at puberty is
about two deaths per 10,000 persons per year. This rate
doubles every 7.5 to eight years thereafter. The Gompertz
equation says that at this rate, 100% of the group will be
dead in about 110 years. Hence, the maximum life span of
humans is about 110 years.
   The Colorado experiments were done in a roundworm known as
Caenorhabditis elegans. It is found in the soil, is less than
0.04 of an inch long and is composed of less than 1,000
cells, Mr. Johnson said.
   A few years ago, researchers found that mutations of a
single gene increased the maximum life span of the worms by
60% to 110%. Mr. Johnson claims to be close to locating the
gene, which has been dubbed the age-1 gene. In the newly
reported experiments, the aging of one strain of worms with a
mutant age-1 gene was slowed to the point that the death rate
doubled as infrequently as each 7.3 days instead of each 3.5
to 4.5 days for normal worms used in the experiments. As a
result, the maximum life span of the mutant strain rose to
about 37 days from 21 to 23 days in the normal strains. In
another mutant strain, the maximum life span was more than
doubled to 57 days by a mutation of the age-1 gene.

   Iraq isn't the only Asian nation with nuclear ambitions
and an unhealthy interest in its neighbors' real estate. Just
to the north and east of the Persian Gulf, Indian and
Pakistani forces are sniping at each other across the border
of Kashmir. The two countries have fought three wars since
1947: It looks disturbingly as if they are preparing for a
fourth.
   Last week, Pakistan accused India of attacking a military
stronghold on its side of the mountains; this week, India
announced that Pakistani artillery had bombarded Indian
installations. For the moment, India and Pakistan are
quarreling over who shoved whom first. But the real issue is
control of the Indian province of Jammu &amp; Kashmir -- the
issue that sparked the second Indo-Pak War in 1965.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The largely Moslem people of Indian Kashmir are rebelling
violently against the authorities in New Delhi. They complain
that they were taken into India against their will in 1947
and that New Delhi has systematically rigged elections in the
province to keep nationalists out of power. The Indian
military is suppressing the rebellion in its usually bloody
and incompetent way. Hundreds have been killed. Pakistan,
which occupies a chunk of Kashmir itself, is, if not arming
the rebels, at least turning a blind eye to arms smuggling.
   It's exactly the same pattern as in the rich Indian
province of Punjab. There too New Delhi goaded a religious
minority, this time the Sikhs, into political extremism. The
Sikh extremists committed horrible atrocities. The Indian
government reacted even more atrociously. An ensuing
anti-Sikh pogrom in New Delhi claimed 3,000 lives. All the
while, guns poured in over the Pakistani border.
   The U.S. has usually watched Indo-Pak relations with
dismay. To its credit, India conducts itself as a huge, if
turbulent and imperfect, democracy. Pakistan has been a good
friend of the U.S. and a bulwark against the Soviet thrust
into Afghanistan.
   Pakistan's popularly elected Bhutto government has now
been removed under a torrent of corruption and mismanagement
charges. For all her faults, Ms. Bhutto was genuinely
uninterested in war with India. It's not clear that her
successors will feel the same way -- especially not after a
few more months of watching Indian troops maltreat their
co-religionists. Indian Prime Minister V.P. Singh, meanwhile,
knows that if he lets Kashmir go, his whole country -- a
seething mass of ethnic, religious, regional, clan and caste
hatreds -- could unravel.
   All of this would be a dreadful but largely local story if
India had not started an arms race on the subcontinent. It
exploded a nuclear bomb in 1974; Pakistan has been
frantically trying to catch up for 15 years. India has built
a blue ocean navy, including two aircraft carriers and a
Soviet-built nuclear submarine, that is making countries as
far away as Australia nervous.
   If India and Pakistan want to run wasteful, socialist
economies, that's their business. If they can't preserve
peace among their component minority groups, that's also
their business. But if they begin to threaten not only each
other but the rest of their region with conventional
firepower or, ultimately, nuclear intimidation, then they
will attract the world's interest. Like Iraq, they serve as a
reminder that the world is still an unsettled place, where
bellicose nations threaten to hurl their increasingly large
and powerful armies at one another's throats.

   U.S. Opens Inquiry
   Into Sale of Parts
   By Airline Supplier

   WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said it is
investigating allegations that a Kansas City, Mo.,
aircraft-parts broker sold faulty and unsafe parts to
commercial airlines.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said it has alerted
customers of the company, K.C. Aerospace, but federal
officials declined to identify airlines that have bought
parts from the broker.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for Pan American World Airways said the
airline has bought avionics equipment from the company but
that the equipment had been checked and cleared before being
used. The airline said that it has stopped doing business
with the company until the matter is resolved.
   A spokesman for USAir Inc. said the airline had bought two
pieces of communications equipment from K.C. Aerospace but
that they were in storage and would be examined by engineers
before being used. He also said the airline had bought some
auxiliary power-unit bearings from the company but was
confident, based on records, that they were safe.
   Northwest Airlines said it purchased used parts from K.C.
Aerospace, but tested them before using them. The carrier
said it was checking to determine whether it also had
purchased new parts and whether those parts were tested
before use.
   A spokesman for United Airlines said the airline had
purchased one part from the company this year and four parts
last year, two of which were rejected and returned to K.C.
Aerospace. American Airlines hasn't purchased parts from K.C.
Aerospace in the past two years, a spokesman for the carrier
said.
   Continental Airlines is also a customer, according to a
lawyer for K.C. Aerospace, but officials with that carrier
couldn't be reached for comment.
   K.C. Aerospace, which has about 40 employees, sells both
new and used electronic equipment for aircraft. It also
operates an aircraft-parts repair service. The company denied
any wrongdoing and said it was continuing to operate.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, explaining why he had
taken the unusual step of announcing the investigation while
no charges have been brought, said that airline passengers
could be at risk. "We must be constantly alert to allegations
that involve tampering with the safety of the public," he
said in a prepared statement. The department has not alleged
that any parts from the company have resulted in any deaths
or injuries.
   The K.C. Aerospace lawyer, Richard Helfand, said, "We have
no idea what {the government is} looking for, and they aren't
telling us." He added that the company had given federal
agents "whatever records they asked for" during a
court-authorized search on Aug. 15. The Justice Department
refused to disclose the source of the allegations against the
small, closely held company.
   The government believes that K.C. Aerospace may have
"misrepresented the condition and source of parts supplied to
its commercial customers, which include airlines," the
Justice Department said in its statement. The FAA is trying
to assist airlines in identifying those parts that possibly
should be removed from their inventories or replaced on
aircraft.
   The FAA will scrutinize, for example, whether the K.C.
Aerospace falsely stated that used parts were new, according
to Robert Buckhorn, a spokesman for the agency. The FAA has
told airlines, other airplane operators and aviation vendors
that all parts bought from K.C. Aerospace "should be verified
by independent means" as to their source and condition.
   In a related but separate investigation, the FAA is
considering whether to revoke the company's certificate to
operate a repair station. Such stations, which normally
repair broken aircraft parts sent by airlines and other
aircraft operators, are certificated by the FAA. "We're
looking to see whether the work they are doing is meeting our
specifications," said Mr. Buckhorn.

   Sales of U.S.-Built Vehicles Fall 4.7%
   In a Discouraging Sign for Auto Makers

   DETROIT -- Sales of domestic-built cars and trucks fell
4.7% in mid-August, a smaller drop than some experts had
expected, but a discouraging sign for auto makers
nonetheless.
   Growing concerns about economic uncertainty and increasing
tensions in the Persian Gulf have made already-cautious
consumers even more nervous, several dealers said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We aren't seeing that impetuous-type buyer," said Tony
Tulino, general sales manager at Faulkner Oldsmobile in
Philadelphia. "Overall, our customers are concerned about
what's going on in the Middle East. We're seeing a careful,
scrutinizing buyer."
   Makers of domestic vehicles sold 261,389 cars and trucks
in the Aug. 11-20 period compared with 274,320 vehicles a
year earlier.
   The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for the 10-day
period hit 7 million vehicles, according to a Commerce
Department formula. That rate is substantially lower than the
strong 8.4 million car-sales pace a year ago, but up from the
rate of 6.6 million cars in early August.
   "Considering all the negatives out there -- stagnant
growth, declining employment, rising energy prices and
international tension -- I expected much worse," said Thomas
Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers
Association. Sales of trucks and of Japanese cars made in the
U.S. showed some strength, Mr. Webb said, but he predicted
that neither will escape the effects of a sluggish economy
and rising gasoline prices.
   Chrysler Corp. posted the sharpest sales decline among the
Big Three auto makers, continuing a months-long pattern. The
company's domestic car sales skidded 27.3%, while its
domestic truck sales dropped 9.5%. The company's Jeep sales
have been badly hurt by Ford Motor Co.'s recent introduction
of its Explorer sport-utility vehicle.
   Ford's domestic car sales fell 22.9%, but truck sales rose
19.3%, largely on the strength of the Explorer.
   "Our truck sales are up 25% this month and that's boosted
mainly by the Explorer," said Lou Stanford, owner of Varsity
Ford in Ann Arbor, Mich. He said that "probably 10% to 20%"
of people trading in vehicles for the Ford Explorer are
trading in Jeep Wagoneers for the top-of-the-line Eddie Bauer
model.
   General Motors Corp. fared the best among the Big Three,
again continuing a recent trend. Its domestic car sales fell
10.1%, while its truck sales edged up 1.3%. Sales in the
Oldsmobile division fell 26.7%; Buick sales dropped 25%.
   To help spur sales of its Oldsmobile models, GM yesterday
added cash rebates ranging from $500 to $1,500 on select 1991
models, and doubled rebates on some 1990 models to a maximum
of $2,500. The program is an enhancement of an existing
incentive program than runs through Sept. 26, the company
said.
   Mr. Tulino said Faulkner Oldsmobile had sold 753 new
Oldsmobiles in the first seven months of this year, down from
931 a year ago but is hopeful that the latest round of
rebates will boost sales. "When incentives go up, so do
sales, most of the time," he added.
   The sales decline also touched Japanese auto maker Nissan
Motor Co. Its domestic truck sales fell 3.5% while its car
sales rose 3.9%
   Toyota Motor Co. reported a 65.8% increase in sales of
U.S.-made cars, while Honda Motor Co. showed a 26.6%
improvement in its domestic car sales.

   Time Is Crucial Factor in Persian Gulf Crisis,
   But Whose Ally It Will Be Remains a Mystery

   Of all the burning questions confronting President Bush
and Saddam Hussein, the most searing is this: Whose side is
time on?
   How the two leaders answer that may be the crucial factor
in determining whether the current confrontation leads to a
quick war or evolves into a long-term siege. If President
Bush, in particular, decides that time works against him, he
will be far more likely to seek a rationale for striking
quickly against Iraq.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Yet the question is an agonizing one, for there is no
clear answer. Some powerful American voices are arguing that
a prolonged showdown would clearly benefit Saddam Hussein and
erode the U.S. position. As this argument goes, support will
erode for the international economic blockade of Iraq,
Western hostages will be maneuvered into position as shields
against attack, Saddam Hussein's anti-Western rhetoric will
win converts around the Arab world and America's political
and economic standing will erode.
   "Time is not on our side," declares former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger, one of the most forceful advocates of
the view that the U.S. shouldn't allow a prolonged stalemate.
"The United States stands to lose most from a long siege," he
wrote several days ago.
   But in recent days, other voices have emerged, arguing
that time actually works to America's benefit -- and that the
U.S. therefore needn't seek a pretext for a quick military
strike. As this argument goes, the international trade
embargo will rapidly choke off Iraq's one-commodity oil
economy, Iraq's international isolation is growing rather
than easing, the Western military force facing Iraq is
building, and the West won't go wanting for oil so long as
Saudi Arabia and other producers make up for the loss of
Iraqi crude.
   "Every day brings more good news for the U.S. and more bad
news for Iraq," says Barry Rubin, a senior fellow at the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "The embargo is
taking hold." He adds: Saddam Hussein "is the one surrounded
and suffering from political isolation and an embargo. He's
very nervous facing an overwhelming force."
   So far the Bush administration has avoided answering the
crucial question, but the Gulf crisis now has evolved to a
point where the president must choose in order to set his
long-term strategy. If he decides time isn't on his side and
wants a pretext for military action, he could get one as
early as today, when the U.S. plans to defy an Iraqi order
that foreign embassies in occupied Kuwait be closed. It seems
likely that Iraq will forcibly remove diplomats who don't
leave voluntarily.
   But privately, administration officials suggest they
aren't looking to use today's embassy-shutdown order as a
pretext for military action -- and that they now are willing
to spend some time looking for a diplomatic solution that
would avoid bloodshed.
   "Time's on everybody's side if it reduces tension and
there can be a diplomatic way out," says Judith Kipper, a
Middle East analyst at the Brookings Institution. "And in the
last few days, there are a few clumsy signs that {the Iraqis}
are looking for a way to talk."
   Still, some administration officials argue that the only
way the U.S. can lose in the standoff is if it gets locked in
a long stalemate -- an argument that seems to favor looking
for such a pretext to launch quick military action.
   If it allows the situation to drag on, the danger for the
administration lies in the simple fact that the West has a
lousy track record at maintaining concerted international
pressure against anybody. For now, the U.S. has helped
organize a generally tight embargo against Iraq and seems on
the verge of winning some kind of United Nations' approval
for using force to police it. But it's far from clear how
long the U.S. or its allies can stick with it.
   "In a sense, we can afford to wait longer, but public
opinion in this country and in the West generally hasn't been
willing to sustain long embargoes," says Robert Hormats, vice
chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "In a democracy, you
can't keep people enthusiastic for an action as big as this
for very long. They get impatient for results. I'm sure the
White House is aware of that."
   Within the Bush administration, a task force has been set
up under Deputy Treasury Secretary John Robson to evaluate
the economic sanctions, and so far administration officials
are pleased with the compliance.
   The sanctions, of course, are designed to deliver a
one-two punch to Iraq, depriving it of oil revenues by
keeping Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude from going out and keeping
arms and food from going in, even if Iraq has money to pay
for them. Iraq is estimated to have on hand a
two-to-three-month supply of food grains -- wheat and rice --
and other commodities. Rationing and belt-tightening could
stretch those stocks for another month or longer, estimates
Andrew Bellingham, an agricultural analyst for World
Perspectives Inc., a Washington-based consulting firm.
   But, paradoxically, the more effective the sanctions, the
more likely some Westerners may be to break them. If reports
of serious deprivation emerge from Iraq, support for the
international embargo could quickly erode. The U.N.
resolution imposing a trade embargo allows food to be shipped
to Iraq for "humanitarian" reasons, and other nations might
quickly start to call for using that loophole. Iraq's
neighbors may also lose their resolve to support the
sanctions if Iraqis are starving.
   Moreover, administration officials acknowledge that the
Iraqi government has the ability to ensure that whatever food
becomes available goes to Saddam Hussein's army, while
civilians starve.
   And Saddam Hussein may even be able to turn a successful
food embargo against the U.S. by making American hostages the
chief victims of food shortages. "That would put the White
House in the position of being seen as starving hostages to
death," says Lester Brown, president of Worldwatch Institute.
"I think that's where the crunch will come."
   Even without such stressful developments, political trends
at home and in the Middle East could work against the Bush
administration. Since the end of the Vietnam War, Congress
has grown antsy about any prolonged military deployment and
is likely to raise more and more questions about the cost of
the American commitment over time.
   Public disenchantment could grow as well, particularly as
more Americans realize that the countries the U.S. is
defending aren't democracies but monarchies run by wealthy
families. And there could even be some friction between the
U.S. and Saudi Arabia over the big American deployment
because "the social environment {of Saudi Arabia} is hardly
the most attractive in the world for wandering GIs," says Mr.
Brown.
   Perhaps more worrisome, it's possible that Saddam Hussein
may be able to steadily build popular support for his defiant
stand around the Arab world. Saddam Hussein is craftily
trying to portray himself not as the invader of Kuwait but as
a kind of Arab Robin Hood, promising to take petrodollars
away from a few wealthy sheiks and restore them to the
impoverished Arab masses. And he is also pledging to use his
occupation of Kuwait as a lever to end Israeli control over
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   "I think that the longer Saddam Hussein can confront the
world, the more I think he'll be the recipient of support in
the Arab street because he shows the other {Arab leaders} to
be impotent -- that somehow right is on his side," says Ms.
Kipper of the Brookings Institution.
   Yet such problems might actually be outweighed by the
advantages the U.S. would have in a prolonged standoff --
advantages such as Iraq's weak and narrow economic base, the
surprising isolation it is feeling, the growing clout of
American military forces in the region and the unattractive
nature of Saddam Hussein's options for breaking out of his
predicament.
   The very strength of Iraq's economy in normal times -- the
luxury to rely on enormous oil payments -- may be the reason
it is easier to squeeze in an embargo than other countries
the West has tried to hurt with economic sanctions. "The
economic aspects in this situation are unique," says a senior
administration official. "Look at Iraq. To oversimplify, it's
oil-out and food-in." And American officials consider
shutting down both oil exports and food imports to be
relatively easy, since both oil and food are big, bulky items
that can't be "tucked away under your shirt as you go through
customs," the official says.
   Retired Admiral Thomas Moorer, former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, also says that time helps the
blockade. "I don't think he can last out a blockade," Adm.
Moorer says. "He has a single product economy."
   There also is reason to believe that, contrary to initial
skepticism, the international coalition against Iraq could
grow stronger over time rather than weaker. Syria now has
forces in the Gulf aligned against fellow Arab Iraq, and
France seems ready to participate not just in sanctions but
in a naval blockade to enforce them. Japan has begun adding
its financial clout to the effort by offering aid to Jordan
if that strategically located neighbor of Iraq will agree to
cut off trade with Baghdad. Even the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which was among the staunchest official
supporters of Iraq in the Arab world, is showing some signs
of waivering.
   Time also may make Iraq's military options less palatable.
The U.S. force in Saudi Arabia is growing rapidly. It still
could take several months, though, to build up enough force
to successfully attack Iraq on land in the conventional
manner. U.S. commanders say they would like to have something
like a two-to-one superiority over Saddam Hussein's 170,000
troops in Kuwait to feel confident about a ground attack.
   But it may be that the military odds shift sharply in
America's favor after a wait of just a few more weeks, not
months. Elmer Pendleton, a retired major general who was the
senior Pentagon officer in Turkey, says that it should take
only a month more for the U.S. to field a force that could
storm Kuwait. With U.S. air superiority, spy satellites and
electronic warfare capabilities, he says, the U.S. could
dislodge Iraq with a force equal to Iraq's 170,000 or so
soldiers.
   It has also been widely speculated that Saddam Hussein
might choose in the short term to ease his plight by drawing
Israel into the fight, thereby switching the confrontation
from one pitting Iraq against the world to one pitting all
Arabs against Israel and its American friends. One way he
might draw Israel into the fight would be by sending troops
into Jordan, a neighbor of Israel, hoping to provoke a
response from Israeli officials who have long said the
presence of Iraqi troops in Jordan is unacceptable to them.
   But that option may be growing less and less attractive as
it becomes clear Israel would hit back with might. One
Israeli diplomat says such a move by Saddam Hussein would be
"suicidal;" Israel would launch an immediate, massive attack.
Even Jordan's army -- man for man probably the best in the
Arab world -- might fight fiercely if Jordan were attacked,
despite Jordan's coziness with Iraq so far in the current
crisis. The army is made up largely of Bedouins fiercely
loyal to Jordan's King Hussein, not Palestinians more drawn
to Iraq's hard-nosed rhetoric.
   And it may be that assumptions about American staying
power and restlessness among American troops stuck on alert
in Saudi Arabia may be wrong. Unlike in Vietnam, when many
soldiers were draftees, the American soldiers now rushed to
the Gulf "are all volunteers, even the reservists," says
Lawrence Korb, a Pentagon aide in the Reagan administration
and now with the Brookings Institution. He concludes: "Time
is on our side."

   Another Rescue of Kuwait
   ----

   Twenty-nine years have passed since another power-crazed
Iraqi ruler threatened Kuwait. Abdul Karim Kassem (his regime
was overthrown 18 months later and he was subsequently
executed) had neither the strength nor the courage to launch
an invasion. His army had no battle experience apart from a
disastrous appearance on the borders of the newly created
state of Israel 13 years before. In June 1961 Britain and
Kuwait had signed a new treaty of friendship to replace that
negotiated in 1899 to prevent German encroachment into the
Gulf. Kuwait agreed not to cede territory to any other power
in return for British protection.
   The extent of this territory outside Kuwait City was
vague, except to the north: the Turks regarded the whole
Emirate as merely part of the Vilayet (a Turkish term for a
region or large district with a governor appointed by the
Porte) of Basra. Legend has it that Winston Churchill defined
the southern border by placing a pair of dividers on a map,
one point on Kuwait City, one on the northern border, then
swung equidistant south. Hence perhaps the existence of two
curious "Neutral Zones" between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to
the south and Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to the west.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Within days of the new treaty being signed, Abdul Karim
Kassem laid claim to Kuwait and the saber-rattling began.
Kuwait called for military support from Britain: The response
was immediate. Land, sea and air forces closed on Kuwait not
only from Cyprus but from bases then held in East Africa and
Aden.
   In fact, the whole operation had been carefully rehearsed
the previous winter -- so it was not altogether surprising
that it went smoothly. I was serving as the (sole) British
contract officer in the Kuwait armed forces, charged with
running their medical services, and watched in awe as British
troops poured in by air and sea to take up positions on
Kuwait's northern frontier -- in temperatures over 120
degrees Fahrenheit. It may have been rehearsed but no one
could have envisaged a "first night" in such heat, compounded
by a deadly "shimaal" -- a north wind bearing sand which
choked men and machines (a lesson learned by the Royal Navy,
whose jet aircraft were immobilized by this wind, even miles
out to sea).
   A Royal Marine commando unit landed early on -- "very
edgy" they were too, in the words of one of their
sergeant-majors. During the next few days the average fluid
intake of each man was 45 pints a day; a regime enforced by
their excellent NCOs, and I did not hear of a single case of
heat illness in the unit. Alas, this record was not
maintained. Cases of heat-stroke occurred, more frequently in
the "back areas," and several deaths ensued.
   On one occasion a visiting British general harangued the
local ground force commander with the need to instill water
discipline amongst the troops. On the North-West Frontier, he
declared, his men had lived on a water bottle a day. "Do as
the Arabs do, eh?" he concluded, turning to the British
ambassador who was also in attendance. "Yes -- and die young
of kidney stones," he responded gloomily.
   The fortitude of the men in the searing heat was amazing.
"They say it's 128 degrees Fahrenheit in the shade -- and I'm
still looking for it." Such remarks were commonplace.
Grousing, of course, helped. There was the heavily laden
marine staggering across the oil and sand runway near Ahmadi
where the first transports landed -- and nearly stayed, their
wheels bogged up to the axles. One of his comrades shouted,
"Got all yer officer's kit, Nobby?" "Yer-everything except
his mackin-f--in'-tosh."
   But under this banter, tempers were stretched thin -- and
what if there had been a shooting match? In some concern for
my own men I asked an Irish soldier . . . whether he would be
able to tell the difference between an Iraqi and a Kuwaiti.
"Probably not," came the flat reply, "but then I don't think
it would make a great deal of difference."
   The days passed, the wind died, and with it the tension.
Stalemate. The Iraqis never pushed their luck and the silly
season started. Fifty more staff officers arrived in the
Brigade HQ mess on some pretext or another. On one occasion a
REME colonel asked for a lift to an abandoned oil company
camp near the frontier to repair a fuse box. We "militarized"
a civil hospital for sick British servicemen when my small
military hospital overflowed. The commander of the Kuwait
army, Major-General Mubarak Abdulla Jabir Al Sabah,
Sandhurst-trained inevitably, announced he would visit them
and distribute gifts. As we walked through the wards and he
addressed man after man I became increasingly desperate as
each one responded to his polite enquiry with the same answer
-- "Piles, sir]" It was a relief to find a lance-corporal who
had shut his finger in a car door.
   Life in the desert had settled into a routine. As I had
the transport which the British army lacked, Kuwaiti medical
teams joined British units. With the Parachute Brigade field
ambulance at Jahra, 30 miles north of Kuwait City, we were
especially popular as we had air-conditioned ambulances and a
piper.
   But conditions were telling on troops in the open desert.
Near the frontier the armored screen provided by the 11th
Hussars had been in position for more than two months. One
evening I watched them playing football. They stumbled, fell,
miskicked, oblivious of their performance. They were
exhausted but unaware of it. It was fortunate they were not
called upon to fight at that stage.
   The Arab League force finally arrived. . . . They were
Saudi Arabian, Egyptian and Sudanese troops in the main,
commanded by a Saudi lieutenant-general. He was forbidden to
communicate with the British -- this included me -- so when
he became ill the consultation took place through an
interpreter and a bed-screen. The Kuwaitis managed the
handover from one ally to another smoothly and gave the
British a rousing send-off.
   It had been a remarkable expression of Anglo-Kuwaiti
friendship considering it was just five years since the Suez
debacle -- "Suez in reverse" was how Nasser termed it. Will
the outcome of this year's onslaught end as satisfactorily?
It is to be fervently hoped so, but this time there will be
no British troops digging in on the Mutla ridge.

   SAN FRANCISCO -- The Pacific Stock Exchange and the Taiwan

aimed at promoting global investment.
   Lee Korins, chairman of the Pacific Stock Exchange, said
he hopes the new, more formal ties will eventually make it
easier for American investors to tap into the lucrative yet
volatile Taiwanese stock market, and for Taiwanese investors
to buy U.S. equities.

   Currently, American investors interested in investing in
Taiwanese companies can only do so by buying a few mutual
funds. "We are trying to build some bridges, and to explore
opportunities to trade each other's products," said Mr.

   For the Taipei-based exchange, the sister-exchange
agreement offers a way to improve its settlement and
regulatory capabilities, Mr. Korins said.

   MIAMI -- Eastern Airlines, in another attempt to lure
business travelers, launched a frequent-flier promotion
designed to award free tickets more quickly than competitors'
programs.
   Under "Business Break," Eastern passengers will receive
two free round-trip tickets to Honolulu, Cancun, St. Thomas
or St. Croix after seven non-excursion round trips on
Eastern. Other airlines' programs generally require more
travel before awarding free tickets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Eastern, which is being operated by a trustee appointed by
the federal Bankruptcy Court, also said it will schedule
special flights exclusively for "Business Break" award
recipients and that bonus travel will be available between
Dec. 14 and April 14, generally a peak period for those
Hawaiian, Mexican and Caribbean destinations. A spokeswoman
said the chartered planes will make it possible for Eastern
to fly to Honolulu, the most popular destination for frequent
fliers, even though the airline doesn't offer scheduled
service to that city.
   Eastern entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection last
year after a strike grounded nearly all its flights and has
been trying to rebuild its operations.

   P&amp;G Drops Plans
   To Market Maalox
   For Rhone-Poulenc

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. dropped its plans to market Maalox
antacid and other Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. products, bowing
to an antitrust lawsuit by the Justice Department.
   Federal prosecutors had challenged the marketing pact in a
lawsuit filed this month because it would give P&amp;G, makers of
Pepto-Bismol, too big a share of the over-the-counter stomach
remedies market. Justice Department officials estimate that
P&amp;G and Rorer had combined sales of $236 million in that $900
million market.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While both companies still assert that joining forces
doesn't create antitrust problems, they decided they'd rather
quit than fight the U.S. government.
   For Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the immediate impact of the
failed marriage is a $30 million reduction in its pretax
income for fiscal 1990. That was the one-time payment
expected from P&amp;G for the right to market Maalox and other
products.
   In 1989, Rorer Group Inc. reported net income of $86.5
million on sales of $1.2 billion. This year Paris-based
Rhone-Poulenc S.A., a chemical company, merged most of its
drug business with Rorer, of Fort Washington, Pa., to form
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
   The marketing and distribution pact included several
over-the-counter and prescription drugs, such as Perdiem, a
laxative, and Ascriptin, a combination analgesic-antacid. But
Maalox seemed to be the most appealing label to P&amp;G because
it is the leading antacid in the U.S., with about a 15%
market share. The marketing agreement also was an inexpensive
way for P&amp;G to launch new products under the Maalox name.
   Now some industry experts say P&amp;G will unveil its own
antacid brand or sell new products under the Pepto-Bismol
name. P&amp;G offered no clues, saying only that it remains
interested in antacids.
   Although Rhone-Poulenc Rorer says it will continue to
manage the Maalox business, as well as the other brands,
others expect new suitors to offer marketing proposals.
   The dilemma for Rorer in the past has been how to spend
heavily on Maalox marketing while also building its research
and development program. P&amp;G was a good partner because it
has the marketing clout to build up the brand.
   "The vast majority of the drug industry was interested the
last time, so there are plenty of places to go," said Gary
Stibel, a consultant with New England Consulting Group, which
has represented drug companies in such ventures. "The
question is, what will the feds allow?"

   Japan May Grudgingly Accept
   Lifting Its Ban on Rice Imports

   YAMAGATA, Japan -- People in this rural prefecture are
determined to defend Japan's ban on imported rice -- but deep
down, many believe change is inevitable.
   "I don't like the idea of (eating) things grown in places
I can't see," says Takehiko Takahashi, operator of a
noodle-shop and part-time rice miller. "But some things you
just can't do anything about."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Two hundred miles to the south, in Tokyo, politicians are
beginning to talk guardedly about a limited opening of the
rice market. Politically, it would be Japan's riskiest
market-opening measure yet. But it's the price Japan may have
to pay for a successful conclusion to the latest round of
multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Clayton
Yeutter pushed that view during meetings with Japanese
officials in Tokyo this week, and some Japanese officials
privately agree with him.
   Japan's 4.2 million farm households and their main
lobbyist, the powerful union of agricultural cooperatives
called Nokyo, are alarmed. The farmers' political influence
has long outweighed their numbers, and many observers think
it's only a matter of time before the government adopts a
long-awaited redistricting plan that would shift more voting
power to the cities.
   On a steamy August day, some 200 farmers gather in
Yamagata for a Nokyo forum with representatives of all the
major parties. Each politician reaffirms the official
doctrine, embedded in a resolution passed by the Diet,
Japan's parliament, that Japan should remain self-sufficient
in rice production.
   But when the floor is thrown open to questions, one farmer
recalls that similar promises were made about the country's
beef and citrus markets, only to be tossed aside in the face
of persistent U.S. pressure. What's to stop the government
from caving in on this issue, too? he wonders.
   Similar questions are on the minds of people throughout
this region, where shimmering, green rice paddies carpet the
valley. Clusters of homes amid tall shade trees mark the
villages whose residents own the surrounding paddies.
   In one such hamlet, 51-year-old Matsuo Itagaki and his
wife are packing melons laid out on a straw mat on the floor
of their barn. Their household is typical of the region's
farm families. The Itagakis work their five acres of rice
land -- a fifth of it given over to other crops under a
government program to trim surplus production of rice -- and
smaller patches of land for melons and fodder for silkworms.
Their two sons commute to salaried jobs: the 26-year-old
works in a cardboard factory, the younger in a government
office.
   When the parents can no longer farm, their sons might keep
the rice paddies going, Mr. Itagaki says. The children aren't
likely to give up their weekday jobs for the risk and tedium
of the dry-field crops, he says. But with rice farming,
mechanization has made it possible for the once backbreaking
work to be done only on weekends. And rice farming produces a
reliable income, thanks to government price supports.
   But Japan's agriculture ministry doesn't want to encourage
more weekend rice farmers. Instead, it hopes to promote
larger-scale farms. Many experts, including farmers, agree
that Japanese farms will be more cost-efficient only when
their scale is increased sharply.
   Toshio Yamaguchi, a ruling-party member of the Diet who
last month declared that opening of the Japanese rice market
is "inevitable," cites Yamagata's cherry growers as a model.
While easing of restrictions on cherry imports has enabled
American cherries to claim a spot on Japanese supermarket
shelves, the Japanese cherry industry has also thrived,
thanks to improved growing techniques and clever marketing.
   But cherries are a seasonal product, and something of a
luxury. Rice farmers here doubt that importing rice would
help reverse the long, gradual decline in Japanese rice
consumption.
   How much a lifting of the ban on rice imports would do for
U.S. exports is unclear. No one is calling for a total
opening of the market right away. Mr. Yeutter indicated this
week that the U.S. could accept some form of import quotas,
in combination with tariffs, as an interim step in
liberalizing the rice market. But he warned that the U.S.
Congress and some developing countries would scuttle any GATT
accord that doesn't include "meaningful reform in
agriculture."
   In one of the more elaborate proposals, a group of
Japanese academics recently suggested setting an import
ceiling of 200,000 tons in 1992. (Japan now produces and
consumes about 10 million tons a year of milled rice.) Under
the Forum for Policy Innovation's plan, Japan would gradually
increase the ceiling while lowering domestic support prices.
   After 1997, according to the plan, the ceiling would be
replaced by a 200% import duty, which the group thinks would
be enough to protect domestic producers. Though Japanese rice
now sells for six to seven times the price of U.S. rice, the
group calculates that imports of short-grained California
rice would be only three to four times cheaper than Japanese
rice of comparable quality, after shipping and handling
costs.
   Thailand and China could also compete for market share,
though some experts say those countries seem several years
away from being able to export Japanese-style rice in large
volumes. Thailand, which already exports about 10,000 tons of
rice a year to Japan for use in alcohol under a loophole in
the import ban, is the world's leading rice exporter. In
1989, Thailand exported about six million tons of unhusked
rice, compared with about three million tons for the U.S.,
according to the international Food and Agriculture
Organization.
   Four years ago, Mr. Yeutter, as U.S. special trade
representative, turned down a petition by the U.S. Rice
Millers Association for action against Japan, and said the
U.S. instead would try to win access to the Japanese market
through the GATT talks. With those talks scheduled to end in
December, Mr. Yeutter now says he is "cautiously optimistic"
that Japan will find the political courage to open its
market.
   The crisis in the Middle East, meanwhile, may be giving
new impetus to the U.S. pressure on Japan over rice, because
Iraq was the biggest export market for U.S. rice farmers.

   Computers:
   IBM Likely to Unveil Potent Mainframes
   In Firm's Biggest Such Move in a Decade
   ----

   International Business Machines Corp. will make its most
important mainframe-computer announcement in more than a
decade on Sept. 5, say industry executives, consultants and
customers.
   They say the new generation of machines -- the first since
1985 -- will initially provide twice the power of the current
generation. Also, over the next few years it will become
possible to lash as many as 16 of the new machines together
so tightly that they act as one computer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That enormous increase in computing power will address
problems all the way down to the time it takes to get a
response from an automated teller machine or a
credit-authorization device in a store.
   That leap should also ensure that the mainframe market
stays healthy at least through the middle of the decade,
despite continuing suggestions that the mainframe is a
dinosaur.
   At the same time, the new generation of machines may not
help IBM much, at least for the next few quarters. Industry
executives and consultants said the new mainframes won't be
available in volume until the second half of next year, and
customers typically stop buying the current generation while
they await the new one.
   In addition, IBM's main competitors are likely to have
similar machines available at the same time as IBM, instead
of trailing a year or two behind, as they have with past
generations. Thus IBM may continue to lose market share to
Hitachi Ltd. and Amdahl Corp., which is 46%-owned by Fujitsu
Ltd. and sells machines based on a Fujitsu design.
   Such concerns -- fueled by IBM's report of weak mainframe
sales in the second quarter -- have already helped knock
IBM's stock price down from $123.125 last month to close at
$96.875 yesterday, down $2.125 in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   IBM, Armonk, N.Y., declined to comment on its mainframe
plans. But Gartner Group Inc., a market-research and
consulting firm in Stamford, Conn., says IBM will initially
announce two mainframe models. One, with four processors, is
expected to operate at 163 mips, or millions of instructions
per second. The other, with six processors, is expected to
run at 230 mips. By comparison, the most powerful machine IBM
currently sells runs at 112 mips.
   IBM is also expected to announce more-powerful
replacements for its highly successful 4381 line of
minicomputers and a related family of smaller and less
successful minicomputers, the 9370. So, in one swoop IBM will
be replacing its mainframe line and much of its minicomputer
line, together accounting for considerably more than half its
revenue and earnings.
   IBM's announcement will be "the most sweeping change in
its product line in the history of the company," says Dan
Mandresh, a securities analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Other analysts, a bit more cautious, still say IBM is
making more radical improvements in the power of the hardware
than it made in the mainframe generations announced at the
beginning of the 1980s and in the middle of that decade. The
ability to lash together numerous mainframes also marks a
major departure, bringing to the mainframe world many of the
benefits long looked-for in the esoteric world of parallel
processing -- where work is split up among hundreds or even
thousands of processors.
   Customers will also eventually benefit considerably from
the use in the new mainframes of fiber-optic channels. The
channels will let the mainframe talk much faster with
data-storage devices and let those devices be located even a
few miles from the mainframe -- currently, the distance can
be no more than 1,000 feet.
   The channels will help at a time when many companies are
trying to cut costs by consolidating their computer
operations.
   The various machines involved in the IBM announcement will
also be able to share work and talk more easily than in the
past. The mainframes, 4381s and 9370s, which all used similar
hardware in the past, will now also get similar software. One
operating system -- software that controls the basic
operations of a computer -- will now be available on that
entire range of machines.
   As far as the financial impact on IBM goes, much depends
on the replacement for the 4381 -- which is expected to be
available immediately and should be a hit. Gartner Group
estimates that there are 20,000 machines -- both 4381s and
certain old mainframes -- that could be replaced by the new
machine, whose cost can run into the millions of dollars. And
IBM hasn't significantly boosted the performance of the 4381
in years, so many users will be thirsting for a more-powerful
machine.
   To back and fill until the new mainframes are available,
IBM is also expected to try to get customers to move to the
next generation in two steps. They would get access right
away to the fiber-optic technology -- but at a price so high
that, in effect, they would be paying part of the price of a
new mainframe now in return for a discount when the new
machines become available.
   Will customers go along?
   "Most of the users we've talked to have been lukewarm at
best," says Jim Cassell, a consultant at Gartner Group.
   DuWayne Peterson, an executive vice president in charge of
data processing at Merrill Lynch, a big IBM customer, says,
"We're not in that frame of mind right now, I can tell you
that."
   IBM has been able to market its way out of trouble before,
and if the incentives are high enough, it can certainly get
some customers to go along. Larry Bacon, a senior vice
president at Travelers Corp., another big customer, says he
likes the scenario IBM has sketched out and might go through
the two-step transition.
   Ken Pontikes, chief executive officer of Comdisco Inc., a
computer leasing company, says, "I think IBM will have some
success with" the two-step process. He adds, though: "What
you don't see is pentup demand for the new machines. The
economy isn't exactly robust."
   Mr. Mandresh, the securities analyst, has sketched out a
scenario in which other product lines could take up the slack
as IBM waits for mainframe sales to kick in, and the company
could still earn $10.50 a share this year, even if mainframe
sales tumble 33% in the second half. That would be up a
healthy 16% from last year, when IBM earned $9.05 a share,
before the effect of a $2.4 billion charge related to job
cuts and plant consolidations.
   Others, however, are less sanguine. "I see four to six
quarters of pain," says Steve Cohen, a securities analyst at
SoundView Financial Group Inc. "Then IBM will slowly slip
away, because this time their technology will be third best
(after Hitachi and Amdahl). I think this'll be the time when
the Japanese finally eat their lunch."
   For its part, IBM doesn't seem to be worried about its
results this year. IBM Chairman John Akers said in an
interview early this month: "We're very encouraged by the
results we've had so far. . . . We expect to perform for the
rest of the year the way we expected to when the year began."

   WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said it called in
three major oil refiners and two independent gasoline
marketers for questioning about the big price jump since
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The department said it's looking for possible price-fixing
or other antitrust violations. James Rill, the department's
antitrust chief, declined to identify the five companies but
said more companies will be interviewed in the inquiry.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We are getting cooperation from the oil companies," he
said at a news briefing yesterday, indicating that compliance
with the investigation has been voluntary.
   Such confidential questioning is typical in the
preliminary stages of an antitrust investigation.
   At this point, the inquiry is focusing on the entire U.S.
petroleum-products industry, rather than on particular
companies, Mr. Rill added.
   Federal officials will decide within four weeks whether to
take the further step of making compulsory demands for
documents from target companies or convening a grand jury to
consider criminal charges, Mr. Rill said. A team of 10
Justice Department lawyers and economists are looking into
the possibility of collusion by major oil companies and
price-gouging by distributors and retailers, he said.
   The American Automobile Association said its most recent
national survey found that the average price of gasoline at
the pump jumped 15% from Aug. 1, the day before the invasion,
to Aug. 20. The average pump price of unleaded regular
gasoline jumped to $1.237 from $1.075 over that period, the
AAA reported.
   State attorneys general, as well as officials from the
Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Energy, are
working with the Justice Department. Scores of members of
Congress, as well as state officials, have criticized big oil
companies for recent increases in gasoline prices.
   In a statement issued late yesterday, the American
Petroleum Institute defended the industry's pricing. Despite
the market turmoil since the Iraqi invasion, "members of the
petroleum industry have been trying to act with restraint and
responsibility," the trade group said. As evidence, it
asserted that the 16-cent-a-gallon increase in gasoline pump
prices since the invasion compares with a rise of about 25
cents a gallon for spot-market crude prices and 35 cents a
gallon for spot-market gasoline prices.
   "In other words, the pump price for gasoline increased by
a considerably smaller amount than have the costs oil
companies must pay to replenish those supplies," the
statement said.

   Retailers, Nike Say Boycott
   Isn't Harming Firm's Sales

   Operation PUSH's call for a nationwide boycott of Nike
Inc. athletic shoes and other products apparently hasn't had
much impact so far.
   Several retailers who sell Nike items report that
consumers for the most part are ignoring the civil rights
group's boycott call. Many customers don't even seem aware of
it, they say.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Nike's stock has taken a pounding since the boycott was
announced, dropping $2 yesterday in over-the-counter trading
to close at $62. But analysts said the declines had more to
do with investor nervousness over the possibility of war in
the Middle East and fears that a recession is imminent.
   Ray Cabillot, an analyst with Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood,
said he hasn't altered his forecast that Nike will earn $7.25
a share on revenue of $2.7 billion for the year ending next
May. Last fiscal year, Nike earned $243 million, or $6.42 a
share, on revenue of $2.2 billion.
   A spokeswoman for the athletic apparel maker said sales in
Chicago, where Operation PUSH is based, have increased since
the boycott call.
   PUSH called for the boycott because it says Nike gets
about 30% of its more than $2 billion in annual revenue from
black customers but invests little in black communities. Last
week, Nike announced a series of affirmative-action programs
that PUSH officials then denounced as inadequate.
   A spokeswoman for PUSH said its boycott is working and

   Apple Prepares
   To Introduce
   3 Computers

   New Line Is Said to Include
   Color Macintosh Model
   At Sharply Lower Price

   Apple Computer Inc. has set plans for introducing three
new computers in mid-October, including the company's first
Macintosh computer with a detachable color monitor that will
sell for a "street" price of roughly $2,500, according to
people familiar with Apple's plans.
   Earlier this year, Apple came under fierce criticism for
sticking with an aging family of lower-cost computers and for
offering color models only at prices above $4,000 at a time
when many color models compatible with International Business
Machines Corp.'s PC sell for below $2,000. John Sculley,
Apple's chief executive officer, has repeatedly defended the
company's move into higher-priced, higher-performance
products. But in February, he forced out his chief of product
development and added those duties to his own.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Apple's three new computers will be the first to be
introduced by the Cupertino, Calif., concern since Mr.
Sculley took over product development. Prices for the
products, all Macintosh computers, haven't been established.
But people familiar with Apple's plans say the products
include a replacement for the company's venerable Macintosh
Plus, a new Macintosh with a detachable color monitor priced
at roughly $2,500 and a high-end machine that's basically a
slimmed-down version of its hot-selling Macintosh IIci.
   Apple won't comment on the future products, though it
confirmed that it plans a major product introduction in
October.
   Industry observers say the new products could represent a
watershed for Apple because if they don't sit well with
customers the company may decide to abandon its proprietary
approach to computing. Today, Apple doesn't license its
system software, which controls the basic operations of its
Macintosh computers, to other companies.
   Senior executives at Apple lately have been studying new
ways of doing business. The company's executives are even
privately asking whether Apple should be licensing its
proprietary software. That software is the key to Apple's
success, but it also prevents Macintosh owners from using the
vast number of software programs written for IBM's PC.
   The most important of the new computers is the Macintosh
LC, a mid-range, color model that offers some distinctive
advantages over the company's low-end Macintosh SE, but none
of the power of its higher-priced color models.
   The LC will use Motorola Inc.'s 68020 microprocessor and
will have room for added electronics gear that will enable it
to run software written for the company's incompatible Apple
II computers. Observers, who declined to be identified, say
Apple hopes to regain some of the momentum it has lost this
year with educational customers who want to buy Macintoshes
but balk at prices for various models.
   While Apple hopes to win back education customers with the
LC, it plans to continue to sell Apple II machines, say
people familiar with the company's plans.
   But the LC probably won't be shipped to customers until
next January, partly because Apple is scrambling to secure
sufficient quantities of color monitors from its chief
supplier, Sony Corp., said one industry executive who asked
not to be identified. Any delay in shipping the LC could
complicate things for Apple because it could result in
customers holding off on purchases of existing models.
   People familiar with the discussions say Apple won't make
drastic shifts in its proprietary approach now. They say
Apple's senior management wants to see the reception given
its forthcoming models before altering its course.
   Even if the new products sell well, however, the company
still could shift gears. For months, some analysts have urged
Apple to begin selectively licensing its system software,
arguing that Apple will benefit from competitors' selling
machines that use Macintosh software. "Who knows what event
will push Apple into doing that?" asked Michelle Preston, an
analyst at Cowen &amp; Co. "It could be any number of things."
   Separately, a federal judge in San Francisco put off
deciding some potentially major issues in Apple's copyright
infringement suit against Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard
Co. Apple claims operating system programs of the two
companies are too similar to the "look and feel" of its
Macintosh system and yesterday had sought a ruling that its
copyrights were valid.
   Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard have contended that the
Macintosh visual displays aren't original enough to be
deserving of much protection under the copyright laws and
that their products were largely covered by license
agreements with Apple, among other arguments. Judge Vaughn
Walker didn't indicate when he would rule.

   Cedar Group Expects
   Gardenbolt Purchase
   Will Pay Off Soon

<LP>
   PHILADELPHIA -- Cedar Group Inc. expects to realize
marketing and management benefits "almost immediately" from
its acquisition of Gardenbolt International Corp., said
Lawrence Rutstein, chairman.
   Earlier this week, Cedar Group announced its agreement to
acquire Gardenbolt, a Sayerville, N.J., distributor of
imported fasteners, for $5.5 million. Gardenbolt had 1989
sales of about $26 million. The transaction is expected to be
completed next month.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Rutstein said Cedar Group believes the move will help
the company expand its market share significantly at a time
when the industrial-fasteners industry is consolidating and
sales growth is generally "stagnant or flat." In the U.S.,
industry sales of imported nuts, bolts and other fasteners
exceeded $1 billion in 1989.
   "Gardenbolt is a major step for us," Mr. Rutstein said in
an interview. "It puts us into the top tier of distributors
in the country."
   Cedar Group would also gain an experienced management team
"that can help us as we make additional acquisitions," Mr.
Rutstein said. Under terms of the agreement, Steven
Schonholtz, president and chief executive of Gardenbolt, will
become executive vice president and chief operating officer
of Cedar Group.
   Mr. Rutstein said Gardenbolt, with more than 50 years of
experience in the fasteners industry, has "an excellent
reputation that can help us attract other companies to our
nest."
   Moreover, the product-line mixes of the two companies
complement each other. Cedar Group, which anticipates sales
in the range of $18 million to $20 million in fiscal 1991
ending Jan. 31, concentrates on bulk marketing of internally
threaded products, such as nuts and washers.
   In contrast, Gardenbolt handles a broad line of screws and
externally threaded bolts. It generally sells them in smaller
quantities at higher margins and to different categories of
customers. "We'll have a wider product line for a wider
customer base," Mr. Rutstein said. As another advantage, he
cited Cedar Group's ability to expand beyond its traditional
distribution centers in Philadlephia, Chicago and Houston by
tapping into the Gardenbolt network.
   Mr. Rutstein declined to make any specific forecasts for
fiscal 1991 sales or earnings, but he indicated that
Gardenbolt would contribute immediately to profit.
   Combined annualized sales would reach about $45 million,
he said. But depending on the timing of the transaction's
close, Gardenbolt may add sales of only about $10 million in
the current fiscal year.

   Zapata Corp. Plans
   To Sell 90% Stake
   In Oil Rig Business

   HOUSTON -- Zapata Corp. said it plans a restructuring that
includes selling a 90% stake in its fleet of offshore
oil-drilling rigs, giving bank lenders 80% control of the
company, and making a cash tender offer for subordinated
debt.
   Zapata said that if bondholders don't accept the tender
offer, it will probably seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Zapata closed at $1.625 a share, down 25 cents.
   Zapata said it expects to reach a final agreement "within
days" with a group of European investors for the sale of a
90% interest in its 12-rig fleet for about $280 million.
Zapata would retain the remaining 10% stake and receive
management fees for three years, as well as a share in any
profits the operations might generate.
   Proceeds would be used mainly to repay $53.6 million of
debt on the rigs and to restructure the firm's senior bank
debt.
   The company said that under an agreement in principle
reached with its banks, the restructuring will cut its $560
million of senior secured debt to $115 million. The banks
would get at least $160 million cash and 80% of Zapata's
common stock. Lenders currently own 30% of the company.
   Zapata also must pay off $15 million in revolving credit
and pay fees related to the restructuring, as well as provide
funds for taxes and future working capital needs.
   Remaining funds will go toward a tender offer for $78
million of subordinated debentures, on which $24 million in
accrued interest is owed. Zapata said if bondholders don't
accept the offer, "it is likely that the company will be
forced to file for protection under bankruptcy laws."
   It said the cash offer will be made "within the next few
months and will reflect the deeply distressed nature" of the
bonds. The company said the bonds have recently traded at
between $350 and $480 for each $1,000 face value, including
accrued and unpaid interest.
   Zapata hasn't had an operating profit since the first
quarter of fiscal 1985. It had a loss of $20 million, or 63
cents a share, in the latest third quarter ended June 30.
   The new restructuring plan supersedes a 1987 plan that
assumed sufficient cash flow between then and the end of this
year to pay down both principal and interest on its debt.
"The first one was {drawn up} under the assumption that the
depression in the offshore industry would come to a close and
evidence that rig utilization would pick up," a spokesman
said.
   Despite recent developments that have pushed oil prices
above $30 a barrel, Zapata said, "fundamentals of the market
for offshore drilling services remain unchanged." As a
result, "We don't have the cash flow to service the principal
and interest at the end of the year" as called for under the
previous plan.

   PARIS -- BSN S.A. said Invus Group Ltd. of the U.S. agreed
to buy the U.S. biscuit operations it put up for sale in May.
   A spokesman for the French food group said he couldn't
disclose the price for the transaction, beyond saying that it
would generate a "substantial capital gain."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Terms of the sale will see Invus Group, a unit of the
closely held Belgian company Artal, take control of BSN's
U.S. biscuit units Mother's and Salerno. The units have
combined annual revenue of about $200 million for a 5.7%
stake of the U.S. market.
   Invus Group will also take over distribution of BSN's Lu
brand in the U.S., but BSN will retain ownership.
   BSN's move out of the U.S. biscuit market reflects its
decision to focus on faster-growing, less-expensive markets
in Asia and Europe, where it has recently been on an
acquisition binge.
   The U.S. pullout doesn't extend to BSN's other U.S.
operations, which include products with higher market shares,
such as Dannon yogurt, Lea &amp; Perrins condiments and Evian
mineral water.
   BSN is France's biggest food group, with consolidated 1989
revenue of 48.7 billion francs ($9.3 billion) and profit of
2.7 billion francs. BSN said Invus Group generates annual
revenue of about $1.3 billion in the U.S., with a large
portion coming from baked goods. It didn't provide further
details.

   U.S. Firms Profit on the Tokyo Exchange

   Japan Gobbles Up Minority
   Stakes in Foreign Units

   TOKYO -- A handful of U.S. companies say they have
discovered a way to reduce the high costs of operating a
business in Japan without major sacrifices in management
control.
   The solution involves listing a Japanese subsidiary
publicly on the Tokyo stock market, and then selling off a
minority interest in the concern to Japanese investors. If
done skillfully, the strategy can take advantage of what's
left of the high prices on Japan's stock market and possibly
improve the subsidiary's recruiting and marketing
capabilities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The most recent U.S. firm to try the strategy is Kentucky
Fried Chicken Co. On Tuesday, executives at Kentucky Fried
Chicken Japan, the fast-food chain's Japanese subsidiary,
served up two million shares on the second section of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. While the market as a whole has been
down sharply in recent weeks, hungry Japanese investors
gobbled up the stock at the maximum value the Tokyo Stock
Exchange would allow.
   The stock sale -- the largest initial public offering in
Japan so far this year -- netted the subsidiary a quick $109
million, according to executives at PepsiCo Inc., Kentucky
Fried Chicken's U.S. parent.
   "Obviously, we're pleased" about investor response to the
offering, said Leonard Schutzman, a senior vice president and
treasurer at PepsiCo.
   In attempting to raise money by taking its Japanese
subsidiary public, Kentucky Fried Chicken has followed in the
footsteps of a number of other firms, including Levi Strauss
&amp; Co., Shaklee Corp., Avon Products Inc. and Hughes Aircraft
Co. The Japanese market's astronomical stock price-earnings
multiples -- still over 40 -- lend powerful appeal to the
idea of listing on the Tokyo exchange.
   Mr. Schutzman says Kentucky Fried Chicken Japan plans to
use the new capital to expand in the Japanese market. With
282 wholly owned outlets and 646 franchises in Japan,
Kentucky Fried Chicken is already Japan's biggest foreign
fast-food chain. The company has ambitious goals; its
management says the Japanese market can sustain as many as
2,000 additional restaurants.
   Prior to the public offering, PepsiCo and Mitsubishi Corp.
each held a 50% stake in Kentucky Fried Chicken Japan. Mr.
Schutzman credits executives at Mitsubishi and the fast-food
chain's subsidiary with recognizing the enormous potential to
raise money through the Japanese equity market. PepsiCo and
Mitsubishi have each retained a 34% share in the subsidiary.
   Mr. Schutzman says the company considered abandoning the
strategy after the Tokyo stock market lost a third of its
value in the first quarter of this year and gave it another
close look when the market resumed its slide this month.
   But even in the current bear market, the fast-food
franchise had no trouble moving its new stock. Kentucky Fried
Chicken Japan was auctioned off for 8,470 yen a share
($57.71). In the first day the shares were traded, the market
chased their price up nearly 30% to 11,000 yen at the
closing.
   The bear market may actually have improved the climate for
initial public offerings for foreign companies in Japan.
Investors here have begun to shy away from big stocks in
favor of small new companies such as Kentucky Fried Chicken,
according to Yoko Kamiki, a trader at Daiwa Securities Co.
   Not all attempts to raise capital through Japan's equity
market have proved successful, though. Offerings by Avon and
Shaklee, issued after the stock market drop in October 1987,
have foundered.
   Officials at PepsiCo stress that the public offering was
not merely an attempt to milk the Japanese stock market.
"We're not planning to take the money and run," says Mr.
Schutzman. Rather, he says, the move is part of an effort to
improve the company's corporate image and to increase market
share.
   Masanori Mochida, vice president of the Global Finance
Department at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp., which advised
PepsiCo in structuring the Kentucky Fried Chicken listing,
says that listing on the Japanese market can also help
foreign companies with their recruiting.
   "Talented management prospects just out of college feel
more comfortable about a company if it's listed," he argues.
"They don't want to work for some firm they don't know
about." Mr. Mochida says that acceptance of a listing
application is interpreted as a sort of "seal of approval" by
a company's business allies as well.
   Officials at Levi Strauss -- whose public offering in June
is considered a success by many analysts here -- say listing
in Japan has helped them from both a financial and a business
perspective. A company spokesman says Levi Strauss listed in
Japan "to demonstrate to employees our commitment to the
Japanese market." The offering also enabled the company to
construct a 46 billion yen distribution center, the spokesman
says.

   NEW YORK -- Liz Claiborne Inc. said two of the company's
founders, designer Elizabeth Claiborne Ortenberg and her
husband, Arthur Ortenberg, resigned from its board.
   Walter Krieger, vice president of financial operations at
the women's apparel maker, said directors haven't yet
considered who will succeed the couple on the nine-member
board. He wouldn't comment on whether the resignations had
been expected.

   The couple retired from active management roles in May
1989. Before that, Ms. Claiborne Ortenberg had been president
and chairman, and Mr. Ortenberg, vice chairman.
   In a statement, the couple said they were retiring from
the board because of "growing pressures" on their time from
their charitable foundation, which is active on environmental
and social issues.
   The couple expressed confidence in the strategy planned by
the company's chairman, Jerome A. Chazen, another founder and
the company's largest inside shareholder.
   In the statement, Mr. Chazen said the company respected
the couple's decision, which he described as "obviously a
difficult one." He said the couple's values will remain at
the core of the company's culture.
   In national over-the-counter trading, Liz Claiborne shares
fell 25 cents yesterday to close at $23.50.

   Soybean Futures Rise on Hot Weather, Concern
   That Surging Price of Oil Will Hurt Farmers

   Fears that rising petroleum prices will increase farmers'
costs on a range of products, along with sizzling weather in
central growing regions, forced soybean futures prices
higher.
   The contract for November delivery of soybeans rose 12.25
cents a bushel to settle at $6.4150, a five-week high for
soybean futures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The high price of oil is likely to inflate costs of
bringing the crops to market, including prices of fertilizer,
chemicals and transportation. Analysts said that concern
drove the market from the start of trading yesterday.
"Initially, I think we were supported by oil prices," said
Steve Freed, analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago.
"That pushed us through some key resistance points."
   Buying picked up steam when fund managers and investment
houses, including Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., jumped in.
Traders said Shearson bought futures for 24 million bushels
of soybeans, and other houses followed suit.
   One major factor supporting the surge in prices was dry,
hot weather in the soybean growing region from Missouri to
Tennessee and along the Mississippi River. The area has seen
only 40% to 60% of normal August rainfall, and no rain is
forecast through the weekend.
   Those factors are feeding a general notion that soybean
yields may not be as high as predicted by the U.S.
Agriculture Department, which has forecast a yield of about
1.84 billion bushels for August.
   However, because farmers in the Mississippi River valley
plant a different, more resilient kind of soybean than their
Northern counterparts, the crop could rebound even with late
rain, said Daniel Basse, director of market research for
AgResource Co., Chicago.
   Rumors of additional Soviet purchases of soybean meal were
circulating in the market yesterday, as was the belief that
farmers in Brazil, a large soybean producer, will be hit hard
by petroleum-related costs. Analysts predicted the soybean
and other grain markets will continue to move on the basis of
news from outside markets.
   Prices of corn and wheat futures contracts also rose.
   In other commodities markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices showed small changes, as
the market entered a holding pattern pending fresh news.
December gold traded over an $8-an-ounce range, between $417
and $425, before ending $1 higher at $420.30 an ounce.
December silver fell 0.50 cent an ounce to $5.2530. October
platinum advanced $3.10 an ounce to $505.90. The bullion
market was active overnight in Europe, as dealers bought and
sold aggressively "with a slight emphasis on the buying
side," according to one analyst. A significant development in
New York futures trading was that the December contract
failed to rise above $425 for the fifth time since March.
This failure is heightening skepticism that gold can rise
significantly from current levels, the analyst said.
"Everything is bullish for gold: The military situation in
the Middle East is approaching a crucial stage, possibly a
shooting one; oil continues to surge, and oil products are
roaring higher; the dollar continues to plunge, as have
stocks and bonds; and yet gold does very little," he said.
One reason for the sluggishness is that traders may be going
directly into other types of investments such as oil,
currencies and interest-rate futures, he said, and it may
take a major development such as a shooting war to send gold
skyrocketing. Another analyst said the market in the past
several weeks has absorbed a huge amount of selling and
behaved well in doing so. He said the Soviet Union may have
sold 75 to 90 tons (a metric ton of gold equals 32,150
ounces), that mining companies had been heavy sellers to fix
their gold at relatively high prices and that some selling
might even have come from Iraq. Also, he said, there has been
little pickup in demand from Europe, the U.S. and the Far
East. Trading has been mostly among major dealers, he said.
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices rose. The December contract
advanced 1.15 cents a pound to $1.2350. Demand was mostly for
contracts from December forward, analysts said, with
liquidation in the soon-to-expire September contract holding
the price advance to a modest 0.50 cent at $1.2965. The first
day for notices to be issued indicating intention to deliver
copper against the September contract is next Friday; the
approach of this date was believed to have triggered the
selling of September contracts, analysts said. As for the
strength in the deferred positions, Fred D'Agostino,
president of Metal Resources Inc., a Riverside, Conn., copper
trading firm, said: "Copper at the moment isn't reflecting
fundamentals as much as it is reacting to the Middle Eastern
crisis. The possibility that a slower U.S. economy might
reduce demand for copper is more remote than immediate
concern over the Persian Gulf tension. This has become a
highly emotional market."
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices advanced. The October contract rose
0.29 cent a pound to 11.31 cents. Judith Ganes, analyst for
Merrill Lynch, said that while the Mideast crisis has taken
some steady buyer countries from that area out of the world
market, higher prices for oil and gold may stimulate the
Soviet Union to spend some of its income from those
commodities on sugar. In addition, oil prices might prompt
Brazil to convert more cane to fuel alcohol rather than to
sugar, which would reduce the exportable amount of sugar.
F.O. Licht, a West German sugar statistical firm, predicted
production of sugar beets in Europe for the 1990-91 season,
which begins Sept. 1, of 33.5 million metric tons, up from
32.9 million tons in the current season. This expected
increase could stimulate demand for sugar, which had been
held down by smaller output and higher prices, Licht said.

   GM Offers to Boost Benefits for Workers
   Laid Off but Proposes No Job Guarantees

   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. told the United Auto
Workers union that it is willing to increase the benefits of
the workers it lays off, but the company didn't offer to
enhance job security for any of its 280,000 UAW members.
   Both GM and Ford Motor Co. put formal contract offers on
the bargaining table yesterday in their bid to become the
union's "target" company for negotiating a pattern-setting
contract among the Big Three auto makers. Details of the Ford
proposal couldn't be learned. Chrysler Corp. will make its
contract proposal to the union today.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The UAW is bargaining separately with the three auto
makers for a contract for a total 450,000 UAW members.
   In its proposal to the auto makers, the union has asked
them to keep all their current employees on the job, and pay
them full wages and benefits unless there is a severe threat
to the viability of the company. That proposal is similar to
the practices followed by Japanese auto makers.
   The union is scheduled to select its target company on
Tuesday, and it is widely expected to be GM. The current
three-year contract between the companies and the union
expires Sept. 14.
   Although few details were provided about GM's offer to
boost benefits to laid-off workers, it is known that the
company is willing to increase the amount of money furloughed
workers get, rather than boosting non-dollar benefits. One
current GM program pays laid-off workers up to 95% of their
take-home pay, although that fund is low and benefits have
been reduced.
   GM's proposal included a base-wage increase in the first
year, followed by lump sum-payments at the outset of the two
following years. GM also proposed to improve its pension plan
for UAW retirees.
   Taken together, the moves could help GM reduce its work
force by taking some of the pain out of permanent layoffs it
says are necessary to make it more competitive and by
encouraging some of its older workers to retire once they
become eligible for pensions.
   In return, GM wants UAW officials to approve measures that
would increase productivity in its factories and allow the
company to discharge habitually absent employees.
   The proposal, which GM officials gave to UAW officials in
a closed-door meeting here, marks the first such initial
proposal in which the company offered pay raises to its UAW
employees. Typically, the company doesn't "put money on the
table" until final negotiations began.
   Neither the company nor the union would formally comment
on the details of the proposal. Persons close to the
negotiations, however, did describe the proposal on the
condition of anonymity.
   The pay-increase gambit could sway UAW leaders to select
GM as the target company for negotiations.
   When the UAW chooses one of the Big Three as its target,
it will break off negotiations with the other two auto makers
and press talks with the target company for an accord before
the contract expires.
   "We're serious about going first," a GM executive said,
indicating his company's preference to be the target.
   GM wants to use the talks to get top union leaders to
support their desire for greater flexibility in the plants.
One of GM's chief objectives is to gain support in the UAW
for operating its plants on three shifts. That would allow
the auto maker to boost vehicle output of some models --
assuming demand warranted such a movethereby greatly
increasing a plant's profits.
   The auto maker also wants to stem absenteeism, a serious
problem in GM's factories; it often hovers around 15% of its
hourly work force daily.
   Although GM's wage-increase proposal comes much earlier
than usual, it is structured similar to the current contract.
The pact awarded UAW members a 3% base-wage increase in the
first year, followed by lump-sum payments equal to 3% of
their wages in each of the following two years. GM's current
wage proposal is less than 3%, but it is unlikely that the
final settlement will be identical with the current offer.
   UAW President Owen Bieber attended formal negotiating
sessions with all three auto makers this week. He urged them
to pick up the pace of bargaining and told them that their
offers will play a significant role in determining which
company the union will select as target.

   West Germany
   Investigates Firms
   For Sales to Iraq

   BONN -- By highlighting an investigation against some 60
companies suspected of sending illegal exports to Iraq, the
West German Economics Ministry is trying to deflect criticism
that might be heaped on Bonn in the event of a Middle East
war.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said
yesterday that 25 West German firms were under investigation
for criminal offenses involving the export of weapons and
weapons-related technology to Baghdad. Ministry officials
also confirmed that as many as 34 other companies are
suspected of less serious export violations involving Iraq.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Haussmann said in a statement he plans to tighten
export-control laws sharply and urged West German businesses
"to be especially careful" in their dealings with sensitive
exports. Meanwhile, the West Germans appear to be cracking
down on some of the most serious violators. Last Friday,
authorities arrested seven people suspected of supplying Iraq
with equipment needed to make chemical weapons.
   The arrests and Mr. Haussmann's statements, which didn't
mention any individual or company names or even specify the
illegal exports, come at a sensitive moment for the West
German government. The U.S. is pressuring Bonn to take a more
active role in international military operations aimed at
containing Iraq. But the West Germans insist their Basic Law
prohibits them from sending troops outside the region of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. West German officials
have said they're considering changing their Basic Law, but
that could prove difficult.
   If the West Germans insist on staying away from the
confrontation, they could face particularly heavy criticism
among their allies for earlier exports that helped Iraq build
up its arsenal. While many countries, including France and
the Soviet Union, supplied weapons to Iraq, German firms are
thought to have spearheaded the development of Baghdad's
chemical-weapons and munitions industries.
   The main question is why Bonn waited so long to take
action. Even Mr. Haussmann concedes that most of the
deliveries occurred "long ago" and only came to his attention
as a result of the Middle East crisis. The first flurry of
concern about questionable West German exports can be traced
to 1988, when Iraq unleashed poison gas on the
Iranian-occupied town of Halabja, where, some analysts
believe, 5,000 Kurdish civilians died.
   West German law bans the sale of any weapons to an area of
conflict, which included Iraq throughout the 1980s. But much
of what was sold falls into a category of goods that is
difficult to control: technology and equipment that have
legitimate commercial uses but that can also be used to
produce weapons. Chemical weapons plants, for instance, are
similar to those used to make pesticides and herbicides. West
Germany began requiring export licenses for such dual-use
equipment only in 1984, and enforcement has been spotty.
   Economics Ministry officials say they have tightened
export controls since early 1989, though they concede some
important regulations are still waiting approval by the West
German parliament. Those measures came in the wake of a
scandal in which West German firms helped Libya develop a
chemical-weapons plant.
   West German officials say they plan to expand the
penalties for those caught circumventing export regulations.
In the wake of the Libyan scandal, West Germany increased the
maximum penalty for those caught selling nuclear or chemical
weapons technology to 10 years from three. Mr. Haussmann now
says he wants to increase the maximum to 15 years.

   Investors Scramble for Short-Term U.S. Issues;
   Yield on Benchmark 30-Year Bond Hits 9.13%

   NEW YORK -- The prospect of an imminent war in the Persian
Gulf battered bonds again, prompting investors to take cover
by buying short-term Treasury notes and bills, the safest
securities available.
   The "flight-to-quality" buying spree was evident in price
quotes posted for long-term securities relative to short-term
securities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, for example, fell
3/4 points for a loss of about $7.50 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. The issue's closing yield jumped to 9.13%, the
highest on the bond since April 14, 1989 when it was 9.14%,
according to Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Short-term Treasury notes and bills, however, ended
unchanged or modestly higher in brisk trading. Dealers said
investors decided to flee the battered stock market and
unwind their money-losing long-term bond positions, using
proceeds to buy short-term securities. As a result, prices
for two-year Treasury notes held firm and the yield was
unchanged at 8.24%. The discount rate on three-month Treasury
bills fell to 7.53% from 7.59% Wednesday.
   William Sullivan, director of money market research at
Dean Witter, said the flight-to-quality buying was first
evident in Tokyo, where investors bailed out of the Japanese
stock market as the Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks
plunged 1473.28 points to 23,737.63. That was the
fourth-largest single-day decline in that market.
   In the broader bond market, prices were knocked sharply
lower. Once again, the market's nemesis was rising oil
prices, which investors fear will lead to spiraling inflation
and interest rates. Fixed-income investors dislike inflation
because it cuts the value of their portfolios by reducing the
inflation-adjusted return.
   After hitting a five-year high Wednesday, October oil
futures ended at $31.93 a barrel yesterday, up 71 cents.
   Douglas Schindewolf, vice president and money market
economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., said investors
are paralyzed by the fear of inflation and "uncertainty about
how high oil could go in the event of an actual armed
conflict."
   Many analysts expect further declines in government
securities, accompanied by higher yields, as long as the
focus remains on oil prices and the Persian Gulf, and not on
economic fundamentals.
   "Forecasting rates is hazardous business with the events
in the Middle East so unpredictable, but I think rates will
grid a bit higher," said James Fralick, an economist at
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said foreign embassies
in Kuwait must be closed by today, and threatened that
embassy personnel remaining in the oil-rich Arab kingdom
could be stripped of their diplomatic status if they remain.
   President Bush, along with other Western leaders, has said
he will not abide by Mr. Hussein's deadline and will keep the
U.S. Embassy open.
   "Tomorrow's deadline could be the triggerpoint," for the
first clash between U.S. and Iraqi forces, said Mr.
Schindewolf.
   Elsewhere, the Commerce Department today will release
revisions to second-quarter gross national product data.
Economists believe the figure will be revised upward to an
inflation-adjusted annual rate of 1.5% from 1.2%, according
to a Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   British government bonds continued to recuperate from a
severe oil-related beating while prices in West Germany were
modestly lower.
   But in Japan, which imports all of its oil, the bond
market rout continued. Traders said higher oil prices and a
disappointing government bond auction pushed yields on
Japan's benchmark 10-year bond to the highest levels in
nearly a decade.
   In Tokyo trading, the yield on the benchmark No. 119
10-year bond ended at 8.31% as the issue's price fell to
82.21, down 0.82 points. The yield on nearest bond futures
contract ended at 88.45, down 1.03 points, to yield 8.089%.
That was the highest yield ever for a bond futures contract.
(When calculated using the semiannual compound measure, the
yield on the No. 119 bond ended at 7.60%, according to
Salomon Brothers Inc.)
   As prices sank, the Japanese Finance Ministry attempted to
support the bond market by purchasing 90 billion yen of
10-year bonds. But the purchase had almost no influence on
the market.
   With yields for existing bonds above 8%, traders said
investors weren't interested in buying new 10-year securities
at yesterday's government auction because the 7.53% yield on
the securities, which was set by the government, was
considered unattractive. The offer totaled 800 billion yen.
   Meanwhile, Japan's long-term prime rate is expected to
jump to 8.5% from 7.9% currently because the sell-off in the
Japanese bond market has sharply boosted the costs of funds
for banks.
   Japan's three long-term credit banks, which reset the
long-term prime rate at the end of each month, are expected
to make the decision to boost the long-term prime rate today.
The three banks are Industrial Bank of Japan, Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank.
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   Long-term Treasury bonds were hit hard again, but some
short-term bills and notes ended unchanged or higher.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
96 1/32 to yield 9.13%, compared with 96 26/32 to yield 9.05%
on Wednesday. The latest 10-year note ended at 98 8/32 to
yield 9% compared with 98 22/32 to yield 8.93%. Two year-note
were unchanged at 99 17/32 to yield 8.24%.
   The Treasury yesterday sold $10.52 billion of 52-week
Treasury bills at an average rate of 7.40%.
   Next week, the Treasury will sell $11.5 billion of new
two-year notes and $8.5 billion of new five-year notes. In
when-issued trading activity yesterday, the two-year notes
were quoted at yields of 8.24% while the five-year notes were
quoted at yields of 8.67%.
   Here are details of yesterday's 52-week Treasury bill
auction:
                                                                                                       

   Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.

   Junk, Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   The junk-bond market added to its heavy losses as plunging
stock prices pulled bond prices sharply lower.
   Junk bonds plummeted at the opening but managed to stage a
partial rebound at midday after the stock market stabilized.
But when stocks resumed their sharp slide later, junk bonds
followed suit.
   Most higher-quality junk bonds ended one point lower, but
mid-to-lower quality issues suffered even greater losses.
   One of the biggest losers was RJR Nabisco Inc. Its 17.375%
convertible pay-in-kind debentures fell 2 1/8 points to 106
1/4 while its 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures ended 3
3/4 points lower at 80 3/4.
   Elsewhere, Fort Howard Corp.'s 14.125% junior debentures
fell two points to 40, Gaylord Container Corp.'s 13.75%
subordinated debentures dropped three points to an offered
price of 62, and National Gypsum's 14.50% senior subordinated
debentures shed two points to 40.
   The market's better-quality recession-resistant issues,
such as Duracell Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co., remained
firm.
   In the investment-grade market, $600 million in new
corporate debt was priced including a $250 million issue of
five-year issue of Federal Farm Credit Banks notes.
   Strong demand prompted underwriters at Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets to increase the size of the issue twice after
pricing. The notes, which are non-callable for two years,
were priced to yield 8.94%.
   In the secondary market, high-grade bonds also posted
losses, ending the day about 1/2 point lower.
                                                                                                       

   Municipal Issues
                                                                                                       

   Municipal bonds were 3/8 to one point lower.
   In new-issue dealings, seven firms won $550 million of
Texas tax and revenue anticipation notes. The bulk of the
notes were purchased by a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
group, which priced them with a 6 1/2% coupon to yield 6.18%.
   Among dollar bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%
issue due in 2018 was 3/4 point lower at 95 3/4 to yield
7.52%.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-securities prices fell again.

   TORONTO -- Noranda Inc. named its president, David Kerr,
to the additional position of chief executive officer,
succeeding Alfred Powis, who remains chairman.
   Mr. Powis, 59 years old, said the executive change was
made last month, but wasn't made public at the time because
"it's not regarded by the board or anybody else as being a
big deal. I don't think it will change anything
particularly."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An internal notice about the change had been circulated to
the staff of Noranda, which is a diversified resource
concern.
   Mr. Powis said the executive change was initiated by
Noranda's major shareholder, Brascan Ltd., a holding company
controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family. Mr. Powis said the
move is consistent with changes taking place throughout the
Bronfman group of companies to make the chairmen
non-executive officers.
   Mr. Powis, who served as chief executive at Noranda for 22
years, said that as chairman, he will continue to focus on
long-term strategic issues. He said Mr. Kerr will continue to
look after the company's day-to-day operations.
   Mr. Kerr, 46, has served as Noranda president since 1987.
He previously served in executive positions at Brascan and
other Bronfman group companies.

   AmBase Says Investor Group Is Seeking
   To Buy 50.1% Stake for $67.8 Million

   NEW YORK -- AmBase Corp., a week after agreeing to sell
its Home Insurance Co. unit, said it received an offer from
an investor group to acquire 50.1% of AmBase at $4 a share,
or about $67.8 million.
   If approved by AmBase's board, the plan would jeopardize
the sale of Home Insurance Co., AmBase's principal business.

   Vik Brothers International, a European-based investor
group, agreed on Aug. 14 to purchase the troubled property
and casualty insurance unit for $544 million. Vik officials
couldn't be reached for comment.
   The latest offer includes refinancing of $410 million in
AmBase bank debt and a cash infusion of as much as $68
million. The Vik agreement called for assumption of $76
million in debt.
   The new investor group indicated that if it gains control
of AmBase it would keep the insurance unit. "We believe that
the Home Insurance Co. is well positioned to become a premier
underwriter," a spokesman for the investor group said.
AmBase's directors are expected to vote on the offer today.
   William Walsh, one of the investors, said management,
including Chairman George Scharffenberger, wouldn't stay on
but that executives running Home Insurance and other units
would be retained.
   The investor group includes Sequoia Associates, Menlo
Park, Calif.; Hermitage Capital Corp., a subsidiary of
Financial Securities Fund L.P., New York; and Whitman
Heffernon Rhein &amp; Co., New York. Some notable names in the
insurance industry are part of the group including Donald
MacNaughton, former chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America, and Benjamin N. Woodson, former chairman of American
General Corp.
   AmBase rose 25 cents a share yesterday to $2 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. It was one of the few
gaining stocks on the Big Board.
   "This is a pretty positive offer," said Gloria L. Vogel,
insurance analyst with Bear Stearns Co. "Shareholders are
left with more than under the Vik agreement." Under that
agreement, shareholders essentially would have been left with
only the Carteret Bancorp Inc. unit, and still holding most
of the $730 million in total AmBase debt. Included in Vik's
purchase would be Gruntal Financial Corp. and Sterling Forest
Corp., among other Home Insurance units.
   Under the latest proposal, the investor group is
considering refinancing AmBase's existing bank debt of $410
million through a new financing facility to be led by Westpac
Banking Corp.
   Once the controlling stake is purchased, the investors
would seek to raise a further $68 million through a rights
offering to shareholders. The rights include zero-coupon
notes, which would carry attached warrants to purchase 34
million AmBase shares at $2 each. If shareholders don't
accept the rights-offer, however, the investors said they are
prepared to make a cash infusion of up to $68 million.
   Spokesmen for the investor group declined to say if they
would use a tender offer to seek the controlling stake, or to
elaborate on the terms of the rights offering. AmBase
currently has about 34 million shares outstanding.
   Udayan Ghose, insurance analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers, said the investor group is in a strong position.
"You're looking at controlling an awful lot of equity without
putting up very much money. The key here was that they were
able to get financing from Westpac."
   Indeed, analysts were skeptical that AmBase officials
could raise enough cash from the Home Insurance sale and a
planned preferred stock offering to pay off its corporate
debt.
   In addition, the Vik agreement angered shareholders who
filed suit in Manhattan federal court last week charging
AmBase with disseminating false information to inflate its
stock price. Before the announcement of the Vik agreement
last week, AmBase shares were trading at $7 or $8 apiece.
   After AmBase put Home Insurance on the block in February,
it suspended payment of its quarterly common stock dividend,
but said that it expected to pay a special dividend to
shareholders when it closed on the sale. Shortly after
reaching the accord with Vik, AmBase officials admitted the
company would not be able to distribute the special dividend.
The shareholder lawsuit claims AmBase should have disclosed
earlier that it would not be able to pay the special
dividend.
   Mr. Scharffenberger has a hefty severance package, which
would pay him five years of salary, plus a five-year
consulting contract. In 1989, he earned more than $1.54
million, in addition to stock options and other bonuses.

   PITTSBURGH -- An investor group opposed to H.H. Robertson
Co.'s pending merger with Ceco Industries Inc. said it may
seek to defeat the transaction, perhaps through a proxy
challenge or bid for the entire company.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the group, HHR Acquisition Corp., headed by New York investor
Douglas A. Kass, confirmed that it has increased its stake in
Robertson to 18.2%, or more than 1.1 million shares. That
includes an additional 115,500 shares bought between July 12
and Aug. 22 for $9.18 to $11 each.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Robertson common closed at $8.50, down 75 cents. Robertson
makes steel roofs and related construction materials; Ceco,
of Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., makes wood and steel doors.
   Mr. Kass said the group's intentions haven't changed
despite the recent death of his partner, Anthony Pedone. In
its filing, the group said it would seek a shareholder list
from Robertson for a possible proxy solicitation to oppose
management in its merger with Ceco. The group also said it
may seek "a possible change of control of Robertson."
   Under the terms of the merger, announced in May, Robertson
would acquire Ceco, with Ceco in turn ultimately owning about
25% of the merged company.
   In a related move, Frontera S.A., a Swiss investment
company, has agreed to invest $40 million to help fund the
cash portion of the buy-out. In return, Frontera would
receive about four million shares, or about 28% of the merged
company.
   A Robertson spokesman said he hadn't yet seen the SEC
filing and couldn't comment.

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   For Saudi Oil Installations, It's Business
   As Usual -- Despite Threats From Iraq

   RAS TANURA, Saudi Arabia -- Iraqi threats of invasion and
sabotage apparently haven't prompted stepped-up security
measures at Saudi Arabian oil installations strung out along
the northern Persian Gulf.
   From the giant refinery complex here to the mammoth
offshore oil and gas fields near Tanjib, less than an hour's
drive from Iraqi tank formations, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. has
done little to reinforce the company guards that remain its
primary protection against any Iraqi-sponsored terrorists,
according to employees and U.S. military officials.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "They haven't beefed up security at all," said Victor
Perrin, who recently resigned from his job training Saudi
workers and is returning to the U.S. with his wife and two
small children. "Their whole policy is business as usual."
   Neil Hjelle, a communications specialist who has worked
for Saudi Aramco for 13 years, said: "Security actually has
been a little bit looser in the past week or two. There is no
indication of increased plant surveillance."
   Saudi officials declined to comment on security
arrangements.
   In contrast, U.S. military commanders have focused on the
dangers of potential terrorist attacks from the first day
troops arrived, and senior officers have put in place
unprecedented security measures to protect U.S. troops from
that possibility.
   To some extent, the security issue reflects broader
differences between the way many Saudi leaders and U.S.
commanders view the current standoff with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein. Some Saudi Aramco directors have suggested to
worried employees that the terrorist threat posed by Iraq and
its supporters hasn't increased significantly since the
invasion of Kuwait. According to Mr. Perrin, one predicted
this week that if shooting breaks out, "the war will never be
fought on Saudi soil."
   On the other hand, many U.S. commanders remain concerned
about Iraq's potential ability to damage vital Saudi
facilities. "Don't ever forget their tanks are close enough
to reach important plants without having to refuel," said a
Pentagon planner.
   U.S. military analysts also have stressed that the
oil-field region is home to nearly all of Saudi Arabia's
potentially rebellious Shiite Moslem minority. Two years ago,
Saudi Aramco officials discovered a bomb planted in one of
the facilities. A number of suspects were arrested, and
employees said the incident prompted a reassessment of the
company's security procedures, but they said few changes were
made.
   The company is believed to have developed emergency
evacuation plans, but employees said they haven't received
any information about what those plans involve.
   According to some Saudi officials, Egyptian troops will
take up positions near some oil facilities in the next few
days as U.S. troops redeploy to get maximum defensive
firepower close to the Iraqi border.
   Meanwhile, there appears to be little concern about the
Iraqi threat in commercial centers in this section of Saudi
Arabia. Stores and shopping areas are as busy as they were
before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and there don't
appear to be additional guards posted around government
buildings. In fact, security officers manning one of the
gates at Saudi Aramco's headquarters complex this week
allowed a taxi carrying an employee and this reporter to
enter without asking for identification from both passengers.

   Reconsiders Plan
   To Offer Shares

   Sun Microsystems Inc. is reconsidering its plan to raise
about $150 million through a stock sale.
   A final decision on whether to cancel the offering hasn't
been made. "It's a day-to-day decision," said William
Raduchel, chief financial officer.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Mountain View, Calif., computer maker announced the
offering 10 days ago, when its stock was trading at $32 a
share. Sun had been seeking $31 for each of the new shares,
but since the announcement the price of Sun's stock has
dropped sharply. It closed yesterday at $26.375, up 37.5
cents, in national over-the-counter trading.
   Given the price decline, Sun's board, which must approve
the sale of 5.9 million new shares, is having second thoughts
about the offering. "We have said from the first that this
(offering) is a question of price," Mr. Raduchel said.
   Some analysts charge that Sun pushed its luck by proposing
the offering just a week after announcing plans to sell,
under a long-running agreement, 4.6 million newly issued
shares to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   "I certainly question whether (Sun's) investment bankers
are serving them well," said Robert Herwick, an analyst at
Hambrecht &amp; Quist. "There's nothing that Sun's articulated
that suggests they couldn't have waited three or six months
before coming to market."
   The offering is being managed by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.,
Salomon Brothers Inc. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   People close to the situation say Sun's investment bankers
are urging that the offering be carried out, citing a belief
that the market for high-technology issues will cool even
further in the coming months.
   Still, Sun may well be in a no-win situation, because even
if it cancels the offering it can't rid investors of the
expectation of further dilution in Sun's stock down the road.
   "Sun is kind of stuck," said David Pearl, a portfolio
manager at Bankers Trust New York Corp. "They can call off
the offering, but they have to raise money and may only be
back again in six months." In the meantime, Mr. Pearl already
is factoring the offering into his Sun earnings forecasts.
   Mr. Raduchel said Sun can't proceed with the offering
until Tuesday at the earliest because its underwriters traded
in outstanding shares of the stock yesterday, and under
securities rules the offering can't commence for two working
days. The company completed its "road show" for the offering
this week and was ready to start it yesterday.
   Separately, Sun announced the resignation of Robert Kavner
from its board. Mr. Kavner, who is AT&amp;T's group executive for
data systems and federal systems, said AT&amp;T no longer will
maintain a seat on Sun's board even though it owns nearly 20%
of Sun's stock.
   Mr. Kavner said Sun and AT&amp;T will continue to work closely
on software and other technical issues but that the two
companies "find themselves competing in the marketplace,
raising potential conflicts of interest."

   TORONTO -- The Pension Commission of Ontario said it
charged four former officials of Enfield Corp. and its former
subsidiary, Federal Pioneer Ltd., with a breach of fiduciary
duties in administering the companies' pension funds.
   The individuals charged are Michael Blair, former
president of Enfield and Federal Pioneer; Jacques Lavergne,
Enfield's former chief financial officer; Donald Webster, a
former Enfield director; and Carole Penhale, Enfield's former
corporate investment manager.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The commission said the charges arose from the purchase in
August 1989 by the Enfield Master Trust pension fund of
nearly two million Enfield shares for 17.9 million Canadian
dollars (US$15.8 million), or 49.7% of the trust's estimated
C$36 million in total assets at the time.
   The Master Trust was an umbrella fund covering various
participating pension plans within Enfield and Federal
Pioneer.
   The commission alleged the share purchases violated
Ontario rules that prohibit more than 10% of a pension plan's
assets from being invested in the securities of any single
issuer. The commission said Mr. Blair also has been charged
with a conflict of interest. At the time of the share
purchases, Mr. Blair was vying for control of Enfield. Hees
International Bancorp Inc., Enfield's major shareholder, was
attempting to remove Mr. Blair from the Enfield board.
   Mr. Blair said he hadn't yet seen the commission's
charges. He denied he had any knowledge of the share
purchase. The other defendants or their representatives
couldn't be reached for comment. A total of six charges have
been filed against each of the defendants, the commission
said. The maximum fine for each conviction is C$25,000.
   Enfield is a holding company based in Toronto. Federal
Pioneer, an electrical equipment maker, has since been sold.

   On Nov. 13, 1988, James and Patricia Miller of Carlsbad,
Calif., and their two sons got into their car, snapped on
their seat belts and headed off for dinner at a relative's
house. They didn't make it.
   The family had driven only a mile when another car swerved
across the center line of a country road and hit the Millers'
Ford Escort head-on. James and Patricia, in the front seat,
suffered broken bones and bruises. Their 11-year-old twin
boys in the back seat were far less fortunate. One was
killed, the other paralyzed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Why did the parents escape with relatively light injuries
despite being closer to the point of impact? They were
wearing "three-point" lap-and-shoulder seat belts. The boys
wore just lap belts, which were standard in the rear seats of
American cars for two decades.
   The family sued Ford Motor Co., contending it knew
lap-only belts offered inadequate protection in a head-on
crash. "Here we were, safety conscious, wore the damn things
and paid the price because of them," says a still-grieving
James Miller. Ford maintains that the lap belts were
effective and that the car didn't "contribute to or enhance"
the boys' injuries. But in April it paid the Millers $6
million to settle the case rather than go to trial.
   The Millers' case may be especially sad, but it is hardly
unique. Safety engineers have known for years that lap-only
belts don't prevent injuries as well as the lap-and-shoulder
variety, and could actually cause injuries in certain
situations. But shoulder belts weren't a priority for
regulators, they say, because only 2% of people buckled up in
the back seat until the mid-1980s. Only last fall were rear
lap-and-shoulder belts required on newly built U.S. cars.
Some 120 million cars still have rear lap-only belts.
   At the current rate of use in the U.S., some 25 lives
would be saved and 500 people would avoid injury each year if
all cars had rear shoulder belts, according to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Twenty-five deaths,
regulators and auto makers note, is a tiny percentage of the
nearly 26,000 Americans killed each year in cars, but many of
these cases are particularly heart-wrenching because they
involve children sitting in the back.
   Car companies are being hit by a rash of lawsuits over the
issue. General Motors Corp. recently disclosed in court that
in the past five years, more than 100 suits have been filed
against it alleging that "defects in rear-seat lap belts
resulted in injury or death." Ford says it has settled a
dozen Escort lap-belt cases and has 16 pending on all models.
   Auto makers have introduced retrofit kits that convert lap
belts into lap-and-shoulder belts, but few drivers buy them.
They cost about $150, including installation. The kits aren't
available on all models, and some dealers have hesitated to
install them for fear of one day being sued for faulty
installation.
   The kits pose a dilemma for regulators: They want to
publicize the kits' availability but don't want to scare
consumers who don't buy one from using their lap-only rear
belts. Lap belts are quite effective in side-impact and
rollover accidents, if not in head-on crashes.
   Auto makers, who are under pressure from the
traffic-safety agency to increase efforts to make dealers
aware of the availability of the kits, say they're doing
their best to get people to buy them. Ford says it sent six
million letters to drivers last year advising them of the
kits.
   It would have been relatively simple and inexpensive --
$20 a belt or less in today's dollars -- to have required
rear lap-and-shoulder belts as standard equipment in 1968,
the year auto makers were required to install them in the
front seat. And it would have been easier still in 1972, when
regulators went so far as to require car makers to install
anchor points for rear shoulder belts. But they never took
the final step and required the belts, largely because auto
makers opposed the idea.
   "It's all taken too long," says Jerry Ralph Curry, who
took the helm at the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration last year and wants to speed up
decision-making.
   It appears in retrospect that regulators might have done
car companies a favor by being more forceful. Auto makers
complain about regulation, but they also concede that it's
often the best way to deal with safety issues. Randall
Edwards, Chrysler Corp.'s manager of safety programs, says
auto makers for a long time believed that safety doesn't
sell. "It comes right out of the profit margin," he says.
   But auto makers don't want to be seen as fighting safety
improvements because of cost considerations, and they resist
characterizing the issue in those terms. "Cost wasn't the
issue," says Richard J. Molloy, an associate general counsel
at Ford. He says Ford feared that shoulder harnesses would
discourage passengers from wearing any belt at all. He adds
that the children's car seats of the 1970s and early 1980s
worked with lap belts, and Ford worried that shoulder
harnesses might mean the seats would be used improperly.
   "At that point in time, that {the lap-only belt} was the
best design known," maintains GM Chairman Robert C. Stempel.
   But was it really? Since the 1960s, safety engineers have
known that, while lap belts keep people from hurtling out of
cars, they don't restrain the upper torso during frontal
collisions. Many European car makers started putting
three-point belts in rear seats during the 1970s. GM's own
Adam Opel AG subsidiary has put lap-and-shoulder belts in the
rear seats of cars sold in Sweden since 1975, and in West
Germany since 1979.
   "We were perfectly aware that the wearer of lap belts
would bang his head into something in front of him," says Roy
Haeusler, Chrysler's chief engineer for automotive safety
from 1960 to 1974 and an early proponent of lap belts.
   Engineers were also becoming aware of even more disturbing
injuries, ones apparently caused by lap-only belts
themselves. "The Seat Belt Syndrome," a 1962 report partially
paid for by the auto industry, described injuries caused by
lap belts rupturing the soft tissues of the belly. "It was
clear that the belt was causing them," says John W. Garrett,
who co-wrote the report, issued by the Automobile Crash
Injury Research program at Cornell University.
   Regulators had always intended to require rear as well as
front shoulder harnesses. But Mr. Haeusler says the car
industry resisted the cost of a safety device with little
consumer appeal. Many drivers abhorred seat belts, and
Congress began pressuring regulators to slow down.
   So in the early 1970s, regulators decided to concentrate
on improving safety in the front seat. "Once that was
accomplished," says Douglas Toms, the traffic-safety agency's
chief from 1970 to 1973, "then, we would move on to bringing
the rear seat up to the same level."
   Instead, auto makers and regulators became locked in a
bitter fight over air bags in the front seat. "Into that
crack dropped rear shoulder belts, never to emerge again
until the early 1980s," says Benjamin Kelley of the Institute
for Injury Reduction, a group formed by trial lawyers that
lobbied for rear shoulder belts.
   Tragedies continued to occur. One happened in 1980 to
Bernard Ames, a public-affairs officer at the traffic-safety
agency, who was riding in the back seat of a car that went
off the road. Mr. Ames, the only person in the car wearing
his seat belt, sustained internal injuries and later died
from complications. The other occupants escaped serious
injury.
   The wearing of seat belts surged in the mid-1980s, mainly
because a series of state laws required their use. The laws
were aggressively supported by car makers in an unsuccessful
effort to dodge federal requirements for air bags or
automatic seat belts. Today, use of rear seat belts stands at
16%, while use in front seats approaches 50%.
   In 1986, the National Transportation Safety Board, a
federal agency independent of the traffic-safety
administration, released a controversial report. "In many
cases the lap belts induced severe to fatal injuries that
probably would not have occurred if the lap belts had not
been worn," it concluded. Though safety experts attacked the
report because it only reviewed crashes where the lap belt
had caused injury, it attracted wide attention.
   In June of that year, even before the report was released,
GM did an about-face and announced plans to install rear
lap-and-shoulder belts in all its cars within a few years.
The car maker was aware of the pending report, but said it
was switching because an internal study found that lap belts
were much less effective than previously thought.
   The auto makers also faced a wave of lap-belt lawsuits. In
late 1987, a Maryland jury awarded $3.3 million to James
Garrett, a boy who was paralyzed while riding in the back of
a Ford Escort that ran into a truck. Because the award was
public, not settled out of court, the number of lawsuits
surged after that.
   In July 1989, under pressure from Congress, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted a rule
requiring three-point belts in rear seats (except in the
center position) by December 1989. Light trucks, including
minivans, were given until September 1991 to comply, though
some manufacturers are voluntarily installing them now.
   The rules come too late for Melanie Knox Ellis, who is now
26. On July 26, 1987, she and her sister Julie Knox sustained
severe lap-belt injuries in a head-on collision on the way
home to Pennsylvania from the New Jersey seashore, where they
had celebrated Julie's 17th birthday.
   "I remember waking up and feeling a hot, burning pain in
my belly," Mrs. Ellis says. That pain turned out to be a
severed artery, which eventually resulted in surgeons
removing all but 18 inches of her intestines. The two young
women also suffered broken backs. Because of her shortened
intestines, Mrs. Ellis has chronic digestive problems,
including trouble retaining nutrients. She recently married,
but has decided not to bear children on the ground that her
body can't nourish another being. GM settled the sisters'
case last month, according to their attorney, Neal Pope, who
says all terms are confidential. GM declines to comment.
   In the crash, the front-seat passenger, was wearing a
three-point belt and suffered a lesser back injury. The
driver, who also was wearing a lap-shoulder belt, walked away
unhurt.

   The first of two 747-200B jetliners built by Seattle-based
Boeing Co. to replace the aging Air Force One presidential
plane was delivered yesterday to Andrews Air Force Base, Md.
   The planes have taken five years to produce at a cost of
$262 million, and will replace the Boeing 707-320B used for
nearly 30 years. The aerospace concern said it hopes to
deliver the second, identical presidential transport before
year end.

   Much larger than the old "Flying Oval Office" first used
by the late President John F. Kennedy, the new planes can
carry as many as 70 passengers and 23 crew members, require
35% shorter runways, have a range of more than 7,140 miles,
are equipped for air-to-air refueling, and have an enhanced
communications system for sending or receiving data through

   The suit claimed that Goal's JOBTRAC and RUNTRAC products
infringed on Computer Associates' copyrights, and used
misappropriated trade secrets.
   Separately, Goal, an Ohio-based software products concern,
said net income from the second quarter, ended July 31, was
$2.1 million, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of $26.4
million. In the year-ago period, Goal Systems reported a

   LOS ANGELES -- U.S. Attorney Lourdes G. Baird charged
Michael S. Moers, the former chairman of the board and
coowner of the now-defunct Brookside Savings &amp; Loan
Association, with four federal felony counts.
   The lawsuit charges Mr. Moers, 39 years old, once a close
associate of the also-defunct Westwood Savings &amp; Loan
Association, with criminal conduct in three separate
transactions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Westwood Savings and Brookside Savings, both of Los
Angeles, were taken over by federal regulators in 1986 and
1989, respectively, and are among the failed thrifts being
investigated by the Department of Justice and Office of
Thrift Supervision.
   The charges allege that Mr. Moers secretly sold his
interest in a San Antonio, Texas, apartment complex to
Brookside Savings. They allege that Mr. Moers concealed his
interest in the property from savings and loan regulators by
using a straw man to pose as the seller of the property and
funnel proceeds to Mr. Moers.
   The lawsuit also alleges that Mr. Moers, who resides in
Los Angeles, together with his associates at Westwood
Savings, owned an option to buy a large piece of prime real
estate in West Los Angeles. It alleges he sold it to the two
savings and loan associations and concealed his interest in
the property from federal regulators by using a straw man.
   And, the lawsuit alleges that Mr. Moers secretly received
consulting fees that Westwood Savings owed him through
another straw man.
   An attorney for Mr. Moers, Robert Silverman, declined to
comment on the charges.
   The four charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in
prison and a $265,000 fine. Mr. Moers will be arraigned
Monday.

   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Intel Corp. said its board
authorized it to repurchase as many as 20 million, or roughly
10%, of its 204 million shares outstanding.
   Buying that many shares at the stock's current price would
cost about $665 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chairman Gordon E. Moore said recent declines in the
semiconductor maker's stock price have made its shares a
bargain. Analysts attribute at least part of the decline to
concern over the outcome of a copyright dispute with Advanced
Micro Devices pending in federal court.
   "We think the market's rapid retreat in the past few weeks
presents us with an opportunity to buy back our shares at
attractive levels," Mr. Moore said.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Intel closed at
$33.25 a share, up $1.25, despite a continued decline in the
overall market.
   Mr. Moore said the company can afford the program. "Even
after completion of this program, we will continue to have
the strong cash position needed to assure that we can
continue our capital and {research and development} programs
with complete flexibility," Mr. Moore said. A spokesman said
the company had $1.5 billion cash on hand as of June 30 and
doesn't anticipate taking on any new debt to finance the
buyback.
   Intel's only previous buy-back was in 1987, when it
purchased 13.4 million of its shares from International
Business Machines Corp. for $27 a share.

   Amdura Corp., a Denver-based automotive and hardware

previously announced sale of assets in its Coast to Coast

hardware cooperative based in Butler, Pa.
   Amdura said cash received at closing totaled about $52.5
million, though Coast to Coast's estate might receive
additional payments of as much as $6.5 million, depending on
Servistar's success in signing up additional independently
owned Coast to Coast Stores. The Coast to Coast unit sells
hardware to individually owned retail stores operating under
the Coast to Coast franchise.

   The assets involved in the Coast to Coast transaction

Coast Stores, filed for protection last April from creditors'
lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code,
pending formation of a reorganization plan.

   Marketing &amp; Media -- Advertising:
   Yugo Taps Agency to Reverse Bad Image

<LP>
   Yugo America Inc., the troubled unit of the Yugoslavian
car maker, tapped tiny ad agency Buckley/DeCerchio to try to
revive its failing fortunes and to combat its reputation as
an auto industry joke.
   Yugo, which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings just
last December, said it will spend $8 million to $10 million
on advertising in a bid to make a comeback. That won't be an
easy trick: The car maker has taken a beating in the image
department following years of complaints about reliability
and plummeting sales.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "What we really have to do is overcome the `Yugo image,'
which isn't as bad as everybody says it is," said John
Spiech, president and chief executive officer of Yugo
America, a unit of Zavodi Crvena Zastava. "But you can't do
it overnight. It takes awhile to come back."
   Mr. Spiech conceded Yugo faces a mighty challenge to
overcome years of sliding sales and negative publicity. The
Yugo remains a favorite target of late-night comics. The
company also must fight a reputation for pumping out cars
that are flimsy and unsafe.
   Yugo is attempting to address these problems in its first
commercial in more than a year, which Buckley/DeCerchio is
filming now in Los Angeles. The ad, which will pitch the
$4,335 GV Plus model, is expected to portray a big rig
lifting the car, turning it over and shaking it vigorously.
   "We want people to look at this commercial and say, `Hey,
this car is reliable,'" Mr. Spiech said. "That's the
statement we need to make." The ad will begin airing Sept.
10.
   But it isn't clear that simple advertising can clear up
such deep-rooted problems. While a $10 million ad budget may
be a step up for Yugo, it pales in comparison with the
budgets of other U.S. and Japanese auto makers, which
routinely spend upward of $100 million annually.
   Sales have been on a precipitous decline at Yugo. In the
first seven months of this year, it sold only about 4,300
cars in the U.S., down from 6,400 in the year-earlier period
and way down from 31,000 cars in the first seven months of
1987.
   For Buckley/DeCerchio, the account almost doubles the size
of the trendy young shop to $23 million in billings. The
addition of an auto account also gives the agency, which
until now has been known for relatively small clients such as
Snapple beverages, an added measure of respectability. Jane
Cavalier, the shop's president, said yesterday that Yugo
immediately becomes the agency's largest client.
   The account also may help establish Buckley/DeCerchio as a
serious shop. Tom DeCerchio, 30 years old, and Bryan Buckley,
26, a former creative team at Chiat/Day, left their posts at
the hot shop to start the agency in August 1988. The two set
up their business in Mr. DeCerchio's one-bedroom Manhattan
apartment, having snagged the $6 million Godfather's Pizza
account, which they still service. After picking up several
other small pieces of business, the executives just this year
moved out of the apartment and opened an office in New York's
SoHo district.
   "For our company, this is a chance to build a brand that's
coming back and attach a personality to it," said Mr. Buckley
of his agency's new assignment. "We're going to give people a
reason to drive this car. This is a great opportunity."

   Takeover Bets Turning Into Bum Risks

   Investors bid up Paramount Communications Inc. shares this
week, amid reports that Chris-Craft Industries Inc. Chairman
Herbert Siegel is buying the stock and that a takeover may
follow. Paramount shares surged $2.75 on Wednesday to close
at $36.625.
   But if recent events are any indication, those investors
are taking a mighty big risk.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After a modest flurry of activity last month, takeovers
have slowed to a near-standstill since Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2. Economic uncertainty generated by skyrocketing oil
prices has given corporate acquirers new reason to pause --
on top of already tight credit conditions imposed by wary
banks and the high-yield, high-risk "junk" bond market.
   Investors who have bet on takeovers have been disappointed
time and again this year. Even arbitragers who trade takeover
stocks for a living have taken a pounding, particularly this
month, on all manner of deals rumored, announced and even
completed.
   Some advocates of takeover investing have retreated from
the fray. "I'd say the average investor is probably better
off to sit on the sidelines," said Michael Lamb, president of
Wealth Monitors Inc., which used to recommend that investors
follow corporate raiders into takeover stocks.
   The oil-price spike has all but snuffed out chances for a
$201-a-share, or $4.38 billion, buy-out of United Airlines
parent UAL Corp. That deal's latest collapse has sent UAL
shares tumbling from $161 to a closing price yesterday of
$93, down $7.
   This decline has inflicted a paper loss of $171 million on
UAL's biggest holder, Coniston Partners, which paid an
average disclosed price of $161 a share for its 2.5 million
shares. Coniston's general partner, Paul Tierney Jr., said
yesterday, "We still have our entire position and will do
everything in our power to effect a positive resolution." But
he wouldn't comment on the stock price.
   The marketwide downturn has left other would-be takeover
catalysts nursing big losses, from the Texas billionaire
Harold Simmons in Lockheed Corp. to a group led by David
Batchelder, formerly chief takeover strategist for T. Boone
Pickens Jr., in Pic 'N' Save Corp.
   Michael Steinhardt, a hedge-fund manager, placed a bet on
a takeover of USAir Group Inc. during the heady days a year
ago when the Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis was pursuing
UAL and the real estate developer and casino owner Donald
Trump was bidding for American Air Lines parent AMR Corp.
Average cost of Mr. Steinhardt's 3.7 million USAir shares:
$45. Yesterday's closing price of USAir stock: $14.25. "If I
live long enough, it'll come out," Mr. Steinhardt chuckled
ruefully.
   Asked about his $199 million paper loss on his 19% stake
in Lockheed, Mr. Simmons replied: "I don't look at it as a
loss. I didn't buy for resale but for a long-term acquisition
of the company." He said he hasn't decided on another proxy
fight against Lockheed management next year, after having
fallen short this year.
   Takeover plays based on supposed calculations of "asset
values" have become particularly treacherous. Some analysts
have been recommending Boise Cascade Corp. based on an "asset
value" of $80 a share or more. Wall Street people say the New
Jersey investor David Bolger acquired 4% of the paper company
and tried to drum up takeover interest. Mr. Bolger wouldn't
comment.
   On Aug. 3, the specialist who trades Boise Cascade stock
was mobbed with buyers on rumors of an imminent bid. That
day, Boise stock surged $4.875 to $36.375, despite a steep
marketwide decline. But since then, no bids have
materialized, and Boise Cascade has slumped back to a closing
price yesterday of $26.50.
   Traders have even managed to lose money on deals that have
been completed. After Forstmann, Little &amp; Co., the leveraged
buy-out firm, announced a $44.50-a-share buy-out of General
Instrument Corp. on July 2, the stock surged to $46.875 on
speculation of a higher bid.
   It is tough to make money buying at $46.875 and selling at
$44.50. But the stock didn't fall below the bid price until
July 26. Nonetheless, "Almost everybody lost money on General
Instrument," a takeover stock trader said yesterday.
   Some takeover stocks have collapsed after deals were
announced, such as American General Corp., which put itself
up for sale following a proxy challenge by Torchmark Corp.
With the sale process proceeding at a snail's pace, the
insurer's stock has slumped from $50.375 to yesterday's close
of $38.50.
   As for Paramount, people aren't holding their breath for a
bid from Chris-Craft's Mr. Siegel. For one thing, he and
Paramount Chairman Martin Davis are close friends. They could
always team up on a friendly bid, because Paramount's shares
have declined from their 1989 peak of $66.50. But financing
could be iffy. Some traders bet Mr. Siegel would be willing
to wait years for something to happen, without acting as a
catalyst himself.
   Yesterday, Paramount shares gave back most of Wednesday's
gains in a marketwide decline, falling $2 a share to $34.625.
   Before the Mideast crisis began, some analysts argued that
investors could speculate on takeovers by buying stocks of
companies in industries where consolidation is predicted,
such as telecommunications, utilities and health care.
   But the Mideast situation has forced every potential buyer
to recalculate assumptions about interest rates, oil prices,
recession and inflation -- the underpinnings of any
calculation of what a business is worth.
   "Given the magnitude of uncertainty today, buyers and
sellers are asking themselves what is the right price for
transactions in almost every industry," Jack Levy, co-head of
mergers at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said.
   "People are certainly more sensitive to the relative
probability of a recession," Robert Cotter, co-head of
mergers at First Boston Corp., said. If nothing else, he
believes the Mideast crisis will scuttle any revival of the
junk-bond market, keeping financing out of reach for many
acquirers.
   "On the other hand," Mr. Cotter said, "if the Mideast
crisis sends the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to 2100,
some companies are going to look pretty cheap." And he said
he believes a "strategic rationale" remains for mergers in
telecommunications, utilities and health care.
   In July alone, GTE Corp. agreed to acquire Contel Corp.
for $6.29 billion, and International Business Machines Corp.
agreed to sell some low-tech businesses for about $2.5
billion.
   But even such strategic acquisitions can scorch investors.
When Pacific Telesis Group agreed to a merger of mobile-phone
operations with Cellular Communications Inc., Cellular's
stock tumbled $2.25 a share on the news, because the deal was
structured to include a series of options and contingencies.

   NEW YORK -- A near meltdown in overseas stock markets,
coupled with still-rising oil prices, sent U.S. prices
plunging for the third straight day.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 76.73 points to
close at 2483.42 -- a level not seen since July 6, 1989. It
was the busiest day since Aug. 3, the day after Iraq stormed
into Kuwait and sent stock investors into a selling frenzy.
Volume was 250.4 million shares in New York Stock Exchange
trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices also fell, finishing
down 3/4 of a point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 of face amount.
That decline pushed the yield to 9.13%, its highest level
since April 1989. The dollar also skidded against most major
currencies as traders sold yen and dollars and bought Swiss
francs and British pounds.
   The volatile oil market helped push long-term bond prices
down, which added to the downdraft in stocks. The October
futures contract for crude oil at one point traded as high as
$32.35 a barrel, matching a level set in August 1983, before
falling back to $31.93, up 71 cents for the day.
   One of investors' fears, said Philip Braverman, chief
economist of DKB Securities, is "that in a hot war the oil
fields themselves would be damaged," keeping oil prices high
even if peace is restored.
   Among smaller stock investors, "There's been a crescendo
of selling and right now I'd say it may be reaching a peak,"
said Philip Dow, retail equity marketing manager at Piper,
Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in Minneapolis. He said he has seen panic
selling among some small investors for about two weeks, but
not every client is bailing out of stocks.
   Thomas Quick, president of Quick &amp; Reilly, the discount
brokerage, said his sense of small investors' sentiment was
not panic but skittishness. He said Wednesday's retail
business was 52% sell orders, and although yesterday's action
was heavier and tilting more to selling than buying, it
wasn't a selling stampede.
   "I've been told by a lot of our branch managers that they
are getting more calls for quotes from people wondering at
this point whether the market can go any lower," he said.
"People are skittish but afraid of selling out just before a
rebound."
   Stock mutual funds continued to lose money yesterday as
frightened shareholders redeemed. But not everybody was
selling. "Most of the people who reacted to this thing
reacted in the first week," said a spokesman for Baltimore's
T. Rowe Price Associates. "While redemptions are higher than
normal, so are new sales. People are still buying. We've had
net cash outflows, but mainly because of exchanges." Among
the hardest hit funds at T. Rowe Price are its international
funds and its small company stock funds.
   "We've had a number of people moving into the money market
fund," says Kenneth Ruder, a senior vice president for
marketing at Denver's Financial Programs Inc. "For every ten
calls, maybe six callers are doing that. But others are
taking an aggressive stance and buying into energy and gold.
Utilities are also being looked at. Some are adding to their
existing equity accounts, taking this as a good opportunity
to buy at a lower price."
   Many institutional investors were bailing out in big
volume yesterday, however, traders said. They theorize that
these investors don't want to wait a day and risk getting
caught in the now-familiar scenario of a huge Friday sell-off
before a weekend when war could break out. Paul Hennessey,
head of equities trading at Boston Co., said he detected a
major push to the exits among institutions in the last hour
of trading, and little evidence of index-arbitrage program
activity.
   But here, too, the flight from stocks wasn't universal.
Ron Schroeder, chief investment officer at J.&amp; W. Seligman,
who manages about $800 million, said he is no longer a
seller. The sell-off "has been overdone," he said. "A
resolution in the Mideast -- either a military one or a
negotiated one -- would send the market upward. My feeling is
{the U.S. and its allies} get their ducks in row militarily,
and it's over quick and dirty. In the meantime, though, what
has crept into the market in the last two days is outright
fear."
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell in heavy trading. On the Big Board,
declining issues overwhelmed advancers, 1,645 to 148.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices fell. But some short-term bills and notes were
unchanged or a bit higher.

   Japanese corporate capital spending in the current fiscal
year will rise 16.1% from the previous fiscal year, according
to a report by Nippon Credit Bank.
   The report, based on the bank's survey of 1,391 companies
conducted in July, represents a 5.1 percentage-point jump in
capital-spending plans from the previous survey conducted in
January.
   "The January survey covers the fiscal year beginning in
April, when a lot of corporate-spending plans still haven't
been settled, so estimates are usually lower than the July
survey. But even so, the latest results show a healthy rise,"
said a bank official.
   The expected 16.1% rise would constitute the third
straight year of double-digit growth, following increases of
10.9% and 15.6% in the previous two fiscal years, the
official said.
   The report said the manufacturing sector's plans are
especially bullish, with outlays expected to be 21.8% higher
this year. Following increases of 25.4% and 24.6% in the past
two fiscal years, respectively, the report said the latest
rise would result in the first three-year stretch of more
than 20% growth since the bank began its surveys in 1975.
                                                                                                       

   MORE TV FOR PORTUGAL
                                                                                                       

   President Mario Soares ended Portugal's 26-year government
television monopoly by signing a law allowing two private
stations to run alongside the two existing state-run
channels. Competition for commercial-television rights is
expected to be intense. The legislation stipulates that at
least 10% of the programs on the new channels must be made in
Portugal and 50% must be in Portuguese. In addition,
advertising can't occupy more than 15% of air time, and
pornographic programs are banned.
                                                                                                       

   DOWRY DEATHS
                                                                                                       

   An average of more than 10 women a day died in India last
year because they didn't bring an adequate dowry to their
marriages, Home Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed told
Parliament. Dowry-related deaths totaled 4,006 in 1989,
nearly double the year-earlier toll. The official didn't say
how the brides had died, but there are frequent reports of
women being doused in kerosene and burned alive in what
families call kitchen accidents.
                                                                                                       

   WOES FOR LEBANON
                                                                                                       

   Lebanese bank and municipal employees started a strike for
higher wages. The action by employees at 118 private banks
and the central bank quickly caused a shortage of cash
throughout Lebanon. The strike by the municipal employees was
expected to cause health problems in Beirut and other cities.
The General Confederation of Labor Unions, which represents
an estimated 200,000 members, called for a demonstration in
Moslem West Beirut yesterday afternoon to protest soaring
prices and deteriorating living conditions.
                                                                                                       

   TROPIC TOPIC
                                                                                                       

   Disappearing mangroves have joined vanishing rain forests
as a cause for concern. Delegates from 20 Asia-Pacific
nations yesterday established the International Society for
Mangrove Ecosystems, to be based at Ryukyu University on
Okinawa. Many of the trees, which grow around estuaries in
tropical and subtropical regions, have been felled recently
to make way for factories and shrimp farms. Some experts said
Okinawa, for example, has lost 90% of its mangroves.
                                                                                                       

   WIDENING GAP
                                                                                                       

   The Philippines had a first-half trade deficit of $1.87
billion, widened from a $1.15 billion deficit a year earlier,
the Central Bank of the Philippines said. The latest period's
leading exports included semiconductor devices, coconut oil,
children's and infant's clothing, copper, and electrical and
electronic machinery and parts. Crude oil, electronic
components, fabrics and aircraft led imports.
                                                                                                       

   FEUDING FARMERS
                                                                                                       

   Feuds over scarce resources in China's vast interior have
made peasant farmers extra keen on having sons -- not so much
to work the fields as to fight other farmers.
   The official Farmer's Daily said the trend was the latest
in a litany of woes, including corruption and resentment,
plaguing China's birth-control policy in the countryside.
   "There are some peasants who scheme about raising the
balance of power against hostile other farmers by having more
sons," the newspaper commented. "They think that more men
mean more power."
   It cited an example of one farmer whose son was carted off
to a labor camp for 12 years for beating up neighbors. "One
has gone," the farmer was quoted as saying. "I'll just rear
another."
   The newspaper said such "faulty mentalities" stemmed from
increasing conflicts caused by the scarcity of oil,
fertilizer, electricity, medicine, plastic sheeting and other
basic items.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Prince Charles is to have a bone graft on his right arm,
Buckingham Palace said. The 41-year-old heir to the British
throne sustained a double fracture in a polo accident in June
and, although the top break has healed, the bottom fracture
hasn't. . . . New Zealand's Parliament passed sweeping
anti-smoking legislation that bans most tobacco advertising,
allows for fines of up to $31,000 and bars tobacco
sponsorship of sports.

   Executives' Perspective on Family,
   Personal Lives Is Said to Have Shifted
   ----

   Today's corporate executives have a different perspective
on family and personal lives than their predecessors of a
decade ago, a new survey shows.
   They're far more likely to have working spouses, and
they're more interested in spending time with their children,
the study found. They're also more likely to think about
retiring early.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The rise of the two-career family has significantly
changed executive priorities," says Lester B. Korn, chairman
of Korn/Ferry International executive recruiters, which
conducted the survey last year with the University of
California at Los Angeles Graduate School of Management, as
well as a similar study 10 years before.
   Some things haven't changed much, however. Based on 698
responses, the survey calculates that the typical executive
is much the same as in 1979: a 52-year-old white male,
married with two children, who grew up in a house where his
mother didn't work outside the home. Gains by women and
minorities have been tiny.
   The 1989 survey was sent to vice presidents and other
senior executives at Fortune 500 industrial and service
companies, "the group from which future CEOs and presidents
will be selected," the report said. Responsibility,
compensation and challenge remain the top three motivating
factors to these executives, the study says; but they are
less important across the board to today's executives, who
seek more satisfaction outside of work.
   However, the executives are less interested in spending
their leisure time on travel or education than were
executives in previous years, according to the
UCLA-Korn/Ferry survey. Spending time with spouses remained
in first place, followed by recreation. But the desire to
spend time with children rose to third place from fourth.
   One-fifth of the executives also reported they had refused
to relocate sometime during their career, with "family" as
the top reason given for turning down a move.
   The increased concern about family probably is due in part
to the growing number involved in dual-career families, the
report says. The proportion of executives whose spouses work
outside the home rose sharply, to 37% in 1989 from 14% in
1979, according to the study. Most work in professional and
technical jobs, but the percentage who work in clerical
positions dropped to 5% from 14% over the decade.
   Some experts, though, question how widespread the change
in family demographics is, particularly among those in the
traditionally male-dominated industrial companies. "While we
do see it in a broad sense in our male employees, we have no
evidence of it in senior management," says Faith Wohl, who
directs Du Pont Co.'s work and family, affirmative action and
diversity programs.
   At Du Pont, where 76% of the work force is male, the
company's extensive surveys have shown that male employees
are "feeling and expressing the impact of family issues on
the day-to-day job very openly," she says. "By and large,
senior management people in Du Pont aren't yet experiencing
that in their day-to-day lives."
   Instead, she sees the impact as coming from the
executives' daughters and sons who have dual-career
marriages. "The issue is hitting them not directly in their
own generation but in the next generation, and they're
starting to see the connections to family issues there," she
says.
   The executives' increased focus on a personal or home life
shows up in other ways as well in the survey. Compared with a
decade ago, more executives surveyed today would retire
early, and fewer would work as long as possible.
   "We've experienced an economic boom, careers for high
achievers have moved very quickly, and they've reaped major
financial rewards far faster than they had anticipated," says
Caroline W. Nahas, Korn/Ferry's managing partner for Southern
California. "There's been a shakeout in terms of people
saying `Gee, I've achieved all this and during that time I've
missed out on the personal life' and now they want to try to
balance that more."
   This isn't to say that today's executives aren't
competitive, the report says. More of them have ambitions for
the CEO's job or ownership of the company than was the case
10 years ago, the survey shows. More, too, are likely to
change companies, and a greater percentage are dissatisfied
with their careers.
   "The ambitions are still strong," says Ms. Nahas, but the
executives have reordered their priorities for their spare
time.
   The slowest change is in terms of opening the doors of the
executive suite to women and minorities. The percentage of
women at the top crawled to 3% from less than 1% in 1979.
Just over 1% of top executives are ethnic minorities, barely
higher than a decade before.
   Women haven't yet advanced to the top in big numbers
because of a "blend" of factors, says Ms. Nahas. Though
discrimination hasn't disappeared, she also sees women
"making other decisions, like going into other businesses,
and some who have dedicated themselves for the past 20 years
who are now trying to balance their lives or start families.
That whole convergence is limiting the numbers," of women
rising to the top of corporations.
   Du Pont's Ms. Wohl says she isn't surprised by the
survey's findings on the sparse number of senior women
executives. "I can look around in our company and others like
it and see that progress has been made, but it's been longer
than anyone envisioned for it to have an impact, especially
in large corporations," she says. Ten years ago, Du Pont had
nine women at manager level or above. Today, there are more
than 150 women in such senior positions, including women who
run large manufacturing plants.
   Though more women will advance with time, Ms. Wohl cites
other factors that "are still getting in the way" at many
companies. These include an uneasiness on the part of some
male executives with women in senior management positions,
she says, and inadequate efforts to help women with family
responsibilities move up in organizations.
   Many of the surveyed executives were more optimistic for
the future. Women will be a part of their corporation's
senior management team in 2000, said 68% of the executives.
Though the top 20 positions in their companies today are held
by an average 3% women, they predicted the percentage of
senior women will rise to an average 16% by the turn of the
century.

   OPEC Ministers to Meet This Weekend
   ---
   As Oil Picture Deteriorates,
   Some to Seek `Blessing'
   To Raise Their Output

   Some OPEC oil ministers will meet in Vienna this weekend
to discuss the deteriorating world oil picture.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
confirmed that Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and
OPEC president, invited his fellow ministers to the Austrian
capital to talk about possible responses to the recent loss
of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes from world markets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "There are going to be consultations among some ministers
Sunday," a spokesman for OPEC said at its Vienna
headquarters, "but we are not calling it a meeting."
   Whatever it's called, the session is likely to be the
closest thing yet to the OPEC "blessing" that some countries
with spare capacity have sought for their pledges to produce
more oil. These countries have been turned down in a request
for an emergency meeting of OPEC to endorse higher output
quotas.
   "This is a very unusual procedure," said a senior OPEC
delegate from one of the countries, "but let's hope it
works."
   Although the promised production increases are slowly
beginning, world oil prices continue to surge. Yesterday,
crude oil jumped by $1.50 to $4 a barrel, pushing more crudes
beyond $30, and fuels rose as much as six cents a gallon.
   In U.S. oil fields, some refiners now are posting prices
as high as $30.75 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark crude. In U.S. futures trading, the October crude
contract rose 71 cents to $31.93 a barrel yesterday, while
unleaded gasoline for September delivery rose 4.44 cents to
nearly $1.09 a gallon.
   Crude oil prices now are more than double their levels as
recently as June. To calm the volatile markets, Venezuela and
Saudi Arabia had been pressing for an emergency OPEC meeting
to act on quotas and production levels.
   That request was rejected Monday. Still, the two countries
have begun to increase output toward a promised total of
about 2.5 million barrels a day, with the bulk of it coming
from Saudi Arabia. The United Arab Emirates could produce an
additional 500,000 barrels a day. This would replace
three-fourths of the four million barrels a day of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti crudes removed from world markets as a result of
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   It isn't clear whether all 13 member nations will have
representatives at the Vienna talks. Nor is it known whether
anyone will represent Kuwait, which remains occupied by Iraqi
troops.
   As of late yesterday, only six ministers had confirmed
they plan to attend, OPEC sources said. They are from
Algeria, Venezuela, Indonesia, Nigeria, Gabon and Iran.
   In Caracas, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez said
seven nations -- the majority required to call a special
meeting of all 13 -- had agreed to be in Vienna for the
"consultative session" on possible oil production increases.
He didn't list the seven.
   The OPEC ministers cannot take official action unless they
are in a regular or special conference. But Celestino Armas,
the Venezuelan oil minister, said Venezuela's view is that
the ministerial majority expected in Vienna could turn the
talks into an emergency session at which decisions could be
made. He told the Venezuelan Congress that the national oil
companies already have begun pumping more, with an extra
350,000 barrels a day targeted that will be stored for
eventual sale abroad.
   Venezuela has been coordinating its efforts with those of
Saudi Arabia for several weeks. But the attendance of Saudi
Arabia in Vienna is a question mark. Hisham Nazer, the Saudi
oil minister, has been critical of the lack of any official
OPEC response to threatened shortages and volatile oil
markets.
   Yesterday, a person close to Saudi oil policies cited two
objections to "this so-called meeting" in Vienna. There was
no formal invitation to the oil ministers from Mr. Boussena,
he said, and there is no agenda. "What we have here is an
invitation to a Sunday barbecue party," he said.
   Others suggested, however, that the Saudis can hardly
afford to ignore the talks. "The only thing I can see
{developing at Vienna} is that Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and
the Emirates will be given some kind of blessing to produce
more," one senior OPEC delegate said.

   TOKYO -- Citing strong sales performance, especially in
overseas markets, and continued success in bringing in new
products, Sony Corp. said consolidated pretax profit rose 32%
to 70.27 billion yen ($481 million) during its first quarter
from 53.18 billion yen a year earlier.
   Sales in the June 30 quarter soared 47%, to 841.18 billion
yen from 571.81 billion a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Net income increased 5.7% to 24.54 billion yen from 23.21
billion in the year-earlier period. Net income growth slowed
despite the sharp increase in sales because of the expenses
connected with the company's acquisition of Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. last November, Sony said.
   Sony's strong performance in the first quarter reflects
strong sales growth in all product categories and geographic
regions.
   Overseas sales, which account for 74% of the company's
sales, posted a bullish 63% increase from a year earlier,
helped by good demand in overseas economies as well as the
yen's weakness against most major foreign currencies, a
spokesman said. Overseas sales amounted to 620.22 billion
yen, compared with 380.41 billion a year earlier.
   Domestic sales rose 15% to 220.97 billion yen from 191.41
billion.
   While the electronics industry in general has had
difficulty increasing sales in the past year because of a
greater profusion of audio and video equipment, Sony fared
well because of the immense popularity of 8mm-video
camcorders, as well as strong growth in other electronics
areas and its record business, Sony said.
   By product category, sales of video equipment grew 38% to
221.19 billion yen from 159.81 billion. In addition to 8mm
video camcorders -- with sales of 800,000 units during the
quarter, up from 550,000 units a year earlier -- video
equipment for broadcast use contributed to strong sales.
   Audio equipment sales rose 30% to 191.89 billion yen from
147.68 billion. Sales of compact-disk players increased to
two million units from 1.6 million units. The company's
Walkman stereo line sold 3.6 million units compared with
3,150,000 a year earlier.
   Sales of television sets also advanced strongly, by 41% to
124.47 billion yen from 88.03 billion in the corresponding
period a year ago. Large-screen color TVs registered
especially strong growth in both domestic and overseas
markets, the spokesman said.
   Sales in other product categories, which include
semiconductors, electric parts, workstations and telephone
and other communication equipment, rose 49% to 124.46 billion
yen from 83.53 billion.
   Sales at Sony's record division rose 25% to 115.65 billion
yen from 92.76 billion, helped by growth in sales by Sony's
CBS Records Inc.
   The movie division, newly added due to November's
acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment, posted 63.53
billion yen in sales, which accounted for 7.6% of Sony's
overall sales for the period.

   A group of disgruntled investors asked Justin Industries
Inc. to put to a shareholder vote the company's proposed
acquisition of Tony Lama Co.
   In a letter to the Justin board, Perry H. Sutherland of
Kansas City, Mo., and Barry S. Rosenstein of New York,
leaders of a group that owns about 11.8% of Justin, called
the proposed transaction "astonishing" and said they would
"review all of our options to protect our 1,000,000-plus
share investment in the company and that of our fellow
shareholders." An offer by the group to purchase the shares
of Justin it didn't already own was rejected this year by the
Justin board.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In Dallas, Justin declined to comment on the request for a
vote.
   Justin has agreed to acquire Tony Lama, based in El Paso,
Texas, for $9 a share, or about $18 million, plus the
assumption of about $34 million in debt. In the first half of
1990, Tony Lama had a loss of $901,000, or 47 cents a share,
after a loss of $1.8 million, or 95 cents a share, in 1989.
Both companies make Western boots; Justin also makes building
supplies and industrial equipment.

   After the Van Goghs
   Come Bud and Miller

<TEXT>
   JAPANESE consumers -- lovers of foreign fashion and art --
are developing a taste for imported beer.
   Budweiser is most popular, but marketers are quickly
expanding shelf space for brands such as Miller, Beck's Bier,
Mexico's Corona Extra and even fruity Belgian brews. Though
foreign brands still account for less than 2% of Japan's beer
market, the value of imports in the first four months of this
year reached 3.4 billion yen ($23 million), double the amount
during the same term last year.
   "People want to drink different beer for different
occasions," says A. John Hamaguchi, a manager at Hiroya Co.,
which imports Corona beer. Imported beer, which well-traveled
Japanese have an ever-easier time recognizing, has the snob
appeal that Tokyo's chic bars like. Indeed, so many Japanese
are following the recent U.S. fad of downing Corona beer
flavored with fresh lime that Hiroya expects sales of the
brand in Japan to double this year to 400,000 cases.
   A cut in the duty charged on foreign beverages and higher
domestic beer prices also are helping ale sales.
   Japanese breweries that market or sometimes even produce
under license most foreign brands are trying to cash in on
the boom.
   Suntory Ltd. now offers Big Bud bottles of about half a
quart for thirsty drinkers. Sapporo Breweries Ltd., which
distributes Miller beer in Japan, hopes to double sales this
year to 500,000 cases by appealing to faddish young Japanese.
Its TV ads try to convince consumers that it's "proper
manners to drink standing up" -- a practice long considered
impolite in Japan.
                                                                                                       

   Car Showrooms Spread
   Outside Auto Industry
                                                                                                       

   SELLING AUTOS in Japan is becoming a hot marketing trick
for companies that aren't even in the business.
   Department stores, railway companies and pasta makers,
among others, are opening showrooms in conjunction with Mazda
Motor Corp. At least 23 non-auto industry companies have
joined a new dealership network -- including car dealers and
firms in totally unrelated fields -- that Mazda has set up in
addition to its regular system. With 119 members, the network
has sold more than 27,500 cars since starting business last
September.
   The dealer network, which also includes regular car
dealers, is called Eunos and is changing the way Japanese car
dealers do business. Dealerships, often affiliated with a
single auto maker, usually represented only its models. But
in the Eunos network, the seven models on sale include French
Citroens as well as Mazda's sporty 1.7 million-yen Miata
(called the Eunos Roadster in Japan).
   Some Mazda dealers aren't smiling. A Eunos spokesman says
the new showrooms won't provide direct competition, because
the Eunos cars are different. But a Mazda dealer in the Tokyo
suburbs says he felt more pressure to sell his cars after the
Eunos showroom was built across the road.
   Though salesmen have long visited prospective customers'
homes to chase business, Eunos dealers try to draw customers
into their fancy showrooms with big displays and racks of
fashionable driving outfits. "Young people nowadays already
know which models they want," says Yasuo Kimura, a Eunos
spokesman. "They want to look at the cars and sign the papers
in the stores."
   Food-concern Showa Sangyo Co. last fall opened an auto
showroom near the entrance of a shopping center near Tokyo.
It plans to display gift packages of spaghetti next to the
racy autos.
                                                                                                       

   Dental Hygiene Items
   Take Bigger Sales Bite
                                                                                                       

   FOR YEARS, Japanese have shown little interest in dental
care, and even considered crooked teeth cute. Suddenly,
though, the country is awash in dental and other personal
hygiene products.
   Marketers are launching new mouthwashes, miniature dental
kits, tooth whiteners and even a 300-yen "bio etiquette
drink" called Smash. Its minty flavor and mushroom extract
supposedly purify the breath. Sales of dental-care products
may grow as much as 40% this year to five billion yen,
retailers say.
   The products are especially popular among fastidious young
Japanese. They increasingly are buying up deodorants and
liquid soap, and spreading the concept of having a "morning
shampoo" -- instead of bathing the night before. Pfizer Inc.
of the U.S. promotes its liquid plaque remover as a way to
keep teeth white.
   But the concept of spending money to keep the mouth clean
may take a while to spread to the older generation. "Japanese
still think of dental care as treatment, not prevention,"
says a spokesman for Warner Lambert's Japanese unit, which
holds 30% of Japan's mouthwash market with its Listerine
brand. It recently cut prices of its 350-milliliter bottles.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   HERE'S A U.S.-Soviet joint effort in the Japanese soft
drink market: Coca-Cola (Japan) Ltd., a wholly owned Coke
unit, is selling a carbonated honey drink using Soviet
fermenting technology. The 200-yen-a-bottle beverage, called
Kefran, is only marketed in Japan, targeting health-conscious
Japanese. . . . In the midst of Japan's worst labor crunch in
16 years, gas stations are offering workers designer-brand
uniforms. Idemitsu Kosan Co. chose Jun Ashida, who designed
clothes for Japan's royalty.

pay fines associated with their 1989 settlement of insider

   In 1987, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged
Texscan and six of its former officials with insider trading
in connection with the sale of 40,200 Texscan shares ahead of
negative news about the company's financial health. The civil
suit, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Ariz., alleged that
the defendants materially overstated the company's financial
results for its fiscal years ending April 30, 1984 and 1985,
and that certain officers used nearly $750,000 in advances
from the company for their personal use.

amounts by last year, the SEC said. Messrs. Palle and Luksch

   DETROIT -- The 10 major U.S. auto makers planned to build
106,425 cars and trucks this week, down 18.7% from 130,980 a
year ago.
   General Motors Corp. said two of its U.S. car assembly
plants will remain idled until Sept. 4. The Ypsilanti, Mich.,
plant has been closed since Aug. 13, initially because the
Persian Gulf conflict derailed an order for Chevrolet
Caprices and Buick Estate Wagons bound for the Mideast, but
now because of a lack of U.S. dealer orders.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The plant that builds the Buick Reatta has been closed
since the end of July to retool for the 1991 model.
   Ford Motor Co. said it's planning Saturday overtime this
week at its Wayne, Mich., car assembly plant and daily
overtime at three truck assembly plants.
   As previously reported, Ford has four car assembly plants
idled this week but has scheduled to reopen the plants next
week.
   Chrysler Corp. said this week it's planning Saturday
overtime for its Newark, Del., plant. The company said it
plans to reopen Monday its St. Louis II assembly plant that
builds its long wheelbase minivans. That plant has been
closed since the beginning of the month for retooling.

   THE U.S. FACES a long stay in Saudi Arabia, however the
current crisis ends.
   Even if Bush succeeds in pushing out Iraq, analysts see no
scenario in which the threat to the Persian Gulf oil fields
recedes. "If we leave, they will be threatened again," says
Henry Schuler of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. The U.S. has effectively assumed the role of
protecting all the Gulf states, including Qatar, Bahrain and
the United Arab Emirates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One sign of a long stay: Many U.S. troops are taking over
abandoned Saudi work camps with permanent structures. But
America's new role raises major problems. One is how much of
the tab will be picked up by the Saudis and by other
countries that depend on Gulf oil. Another is sustaining
support at home and morale among the troops for defending
non-democracies whose customs differ sharply from Western
ideals.
   "What is clear," says economic consultant David Smick, "is
that the U.S. now has a 51st state: Saudi Arabia."
                                                                                                       

   OUT IN THE COLD: Top Bush aides put the freeze on the
Energy Department.
   Sununu and Darman seek to rein in the department, which
they see as too eager to act. The White House vetoed DOE
plans to pump oil from the strategic petroleum reserve,
despite growing pressure with oil prices over $30 a barrel.
"You want to use it when you have a situation where supply
suggests it is necessary," says an administration official,
"and we're not there yet."
   Some department officials hoped for a high-profile
announcement of major energy conservation measures, but the
White House limited them to minor measures and refused to
give the announcement a presidential push.
                                                                                                       

   RECESSION FEARS could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
   With the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showing
the number of voters expecting a downturn more than doubling
since Iraq's invasion, University of Michigan economist
Thomas Juster says that such sentiment could itself push the
economy over the brink. In almost all recent recessions, he
says, "the trigger has been a drop in consumer spending on
discretionary items."
   Richard Curtin, who compiles the university's closely
watched consumer-confidence survey, says "attitudes were very
bleak indeed the first weekend after the invasion." Optimism
has increased a bit since, he says, but remains "much lower"
than a month ago. Today's GNP revisions will further show the
economy's weakness even before the crisis erupted.
   But Bush strategists hope to blame Saddam Hussein for a
recession that may well have happened anyway.
                                                                                                       

   CALIFORNIA'S DECISION to hold its 1992 primary right after
New Hampshire's juggles the political calculus. The early
primary in a large, media-oriented state will give an even
bigger advantage to well-financed and well-known candidates
like Cuomo and Jackson; Democratic insiders expect financial
obstacles will keep some lesser-known candidates out of the
race.
                                                                                                       

   PAKISTAN'S U.S. AID is in peril if its interim government
refuses to let deposed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto take
part in October elections. Not just liberals but also
conservative Democrats like Sen. Johnston and Republicans
such as Sen. Kassebaum warn that a cutoff of the massive U.S.
assistance is possible.
                                                                                                       

   DEMOCRATS DISTRIBUTE a briefing book to candidates urging
them to charge Republicans who raise the S&amp;L issue with
seeking to distract from GOP failures ranging from the
deficit to the Hubble telescope. The book also suggests the
government manage S&amp;L assets rather than sell them off: "Can
an empty shopping center make a good day care center?"
                                                                                                       

   VOICE FROM THE PAST: George McGovern, the 1972 Democratic
presidential nominee, suggests public support for Bush's
Middle East moves will wane. "Is the emir of Kuwait and the

   POLITICAL MONEY nears record levels despite Congress's
talk of reform.
   House candidates have already outstripped all previous
fund-raising -- more than $163 million as of June 30. Senate
candidates are slightly behind the pace of their record
spending of 1986, but have raised more than $115 million,
with Republicans enjoying a slight edge over Democrats.
   Candidates resort to ever-more-innovative schemes. Former
Maine Rep. David Emery, trying to win back his old seat,
offers a two-day Kennebunkport package to PAC managers in
Washington. For $5,000, they get a reception with Bush at a
local seafood restaurant, a photo with him, accommodations at
a local inn and greens fees.
   Sen. Packwood sends a fund-raising letter to pro-Israel
donors, complete with typos to make it look personal.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- This is no Houston, where the economy
truly crashed in the 1980s. Nor is it New England, with its
collapsing high-tech and defense economy.
   But Nashville has its problems. Too many office buildings
and too many apartments. Some financially strapped banks. A
spreading credit squeeze. And worries about spiraling oil
prices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In short, Nashville is a microcosm of what is happening in
many cities around the U.S. It is a city on the brink of
recession, with definite strengths but facing undeniable
difficulties, many of them traceable to the rambunctious
economics of the '80s. What Nashville is up against is
illustrative of the kind of forces that many regional
economies are having to wrestle with in these uncertain
times.
   On a seedy street downtown, George Gruhn has come up
against Nashville's credit squeeze. His business is selling
vintage guitars, banjos and mandolins, and at almost $3
million a year the business is booming, thanks partly to
demand from Japan and Germany. Time to expand.
   Mr. Gruhn wants to buy a vacant Victorian-era building
next door for $185,000. The problem is getting a loan. "My
bankers haven't turned me down, but they're making me jump
through hoops," he says. "If it's real estate, they're
scared."
   Many of Nashville's bankers are afraid to lend to anybody,
after having made hundreds of millions of dollars of
now-soured real-estate loans in the 1980s. "An unspoken wave
of caution" pervades the bank, says Neil Cunningham,
executive vice president of First American Corp., the parent
of one of Nashville's biggest banks. "You're dealing with
human emotion."
   That emotional reaction is evident even though much of the
area's economy is fairly strong, bolstered by a prosperous
mix of the music business, services, large-scale
manufacturing and state-government jobs. Employment is up a
bit from 1989 levels, and retail and home sales are running
about 5% ahead. But now the crisis in the Middle East has
Nashville economists worried that soaring oil prices may tip
a fragile economy into a recession.
   "We're on the brink," says Don Belcher, director of
research at the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce. "With
this Kuwait thing, all bets are off." A surge in gasoline
prices could hurt Nashville's tourist industry; most visitors
to Opryland U.S.A. come by car. And bankers could become even
more cautious.
   The bankers' multiple fears are understandable. This past
spring was a nightmare at First American Corp., parent of
First American National Bank. Federal examiners took a harsh
view of its loan portfolio, and First American increased its
bad-loan reserve by nearly $100 million. On May 29, its board
fired the chairman and president, Kenneth L. Roberts. And
this week, the company said it would eliminate up to 380 jobs
over the next 18 months.
   Many other Nashville lenders, such as Third National Bank
and Metropolitan Federal Savings &amp; Loan, have taken some big
hits, especially in real-estate lending. Yet some, including
the Sovran Bank unit of Sovran Financial Corp., are burdened
with relatively few bad loans.
   The real-estate and banking problems have stunned the
local business community, but no one knows how severely they
will damage the city. If bankers in Nashville -- and around
the nation -- overreact and slash credit across the board,
the fragile U.S. economy, now in its 92nd month of expansion,
could fall into recession. Yet Nashville, like many
communities, retains enough strength to suggest that it will
gradually rebound.
   "I don't know if Nashville has found the bottom, but I
think the bottom is reasonably near," says John Clay, the
chief executive of Third National Bank, a unit of SunTrust
Banks in Atlanta. He doesn't minimize the real-estate debacle
or the banks' role. "The banks have been running all over
each other to do deals," he says. "It's time to pay the
piper."
   The excessive deal-making is typical of what happened in
many cities. In Nashville, it occurred partly because of all
the newcomers who arrived during the 1980s, especially Texas
and Louisiana builders who flocked here and built with little
regard to local competitors or even to what the market would
bear. Many of them are now gone, but their legacy is an array
of empty buildings and lost fortunes.
   The real-estate splurge began here in 1985, a couple of
years after Nissan put an auto plant at nearby Smyrna, Tenn.,
and about the time that General Motors picked a site 35 miles
southwest of Nashville for its Saturn plant. Then American
Airlines selected Nashville as a regional hub. Meanwhile, the
Texas oil patch was starting to dry up. Nashville was touted
as the next boom town.
   Dozens of Southwestern developers, backed by their banks,
headed north. Some speculated in land near the Saturn plant
or in the exurban ring around Nashville. The out-of-town land
speculators became known as "dirt flippers." A flipper would
buy farm land for perhaps $2,000 an acre and try to trade it
for a higher price. It often worked. Prices doubled, then
doubled again in some instances.
   On the expensive land sprang up expensive houses, many of
them too expensive for Nashville buyers. Today, the market is
glutted with large, luxurious houses.
   Far more serious, however, is the apartment glut.
Developers -- locals and Texans alike -- put up huge
apartment complexes, often in the same neighborhoods with
splendid disregard for each other. The result: An area might
have 3,000 apartments, but only 1,000 can be filled.
   To some observers, the lack of coordination in building
apartments is just a symptom of a leadership vacuum. Only a
few years ago, most of Nashville's big institutions were
locally run. "The good old boys, a small, tight-knit group of
15 people, pretty much controlled the town, from the arts to
the lending policies," says John Haggard, a business
consultant.
   Now, many local business chiefs are out of the picture
through death or retirement. One who recently died was Jack
Massey, who built Kentucky Fried Chicken and founded Hospital
Corp. of America.
   And many local businesses were acquired by corporations
based elsewhere. Today, three of Nashville's four biggest
banks are subsidiaries of out-of-state companies. The two
most visible factories are the auto plants. Even Music Row is
becoming dominated by faraway companies such as Sony Corp.'s
CBS records.
   And so in Nashville, as in many cities, power has
gradually passed from leading local families to corporate
bureaucrats, many of them based out of town. The loss of
local control over economic decisions explains some of the
overbuilding.
   But does all this indicate a leadership vacuum? "I think
that's a lot of baloney," says Mr. Clay at Third National
Bank. Though conceding that Nashville's business leadership
is in "transition," he says a new generation of local leaders
is emerging and will gradually become stronger.
   Of course, local leaders had no control over the 1986
tax-revision act, which, as much as anything else, damaged
the Nashville apartment market by phasing out tax breaks
given real-estate investors.
   Beginning in 1988, in the wake of the 1986 tax-law
changes, the limited-partnership real-estate industry
spiraled downward. The apartments didn't fill up, syndicators
such as Freeman Cos. ran into financial problems, and the
banks that lent to entrepreneurs like Richard Freeman had to
write off much of the credit.
   The syndicators' investors and employees also got hurt.
Deborah Clarke, one veteran of the roller-coaster world of
real-estate syndication, says, "I kind of felt I was part of
the San Francisco gold rush. I went out and had my
adventure."
   And some misadventure. She and her husband, David, were
among those who had migrated to Tennessee from Texas. Mr.
Clarke owned a construction company that went belly up in the
Texas real-estate bust of the mid-1980s. Mrs. Clarke worked
for former Gov. John Connolly's real-estate partnership in
Austin. That, too, went awry, and she lost her job.
   In 1988, the Clarkes moved to Nashville, where Mrs. Clarke
took a job at JacquesMiller Inc. Mrs. Clarke, as the
real-estate syndicator's vice president of finance, had to
scramble to refinance maturing real-estate loans. As the
credit squeeze hit, that got harder and harder. She recently
left the company and joined another that advises clients with
real-estate problems.
   Although the Nashville syndicators gathered investment
money nationwide, they drew disproportionately from local
doctors, lawyers and accountants. Many lost $20,000 to
$50,000. The signs of these losses still linger.
   Charitable gifts are down. The Cumberland Girl Scouts are
having trouble in their annual fund-raising. "That never
would have happened in normal circumstances," says Edwin
Moats, chairman of Metropolitan Federal and a member of the
scouts' board. His own S&amp;L, with $140 million in foreclosed
property and problem loans, has halved its donations.
   And although Nashville's overall economy is far from
disaster, some businesses besides real estate look a bit
shaky. Local auto sales are off, for example, and several
Nashville dealers passed up the chance to set up a dealership
for the Infiniti, Nissan's luxury car.
   Many Nashvillians believe that the bank examiners are
making a manageable problem worse. They think federal
regulators overreacted and scared banks into withdrawing or
withholding credit from real-estate developers.
   "It has had a chilling effect," says Ken Larish, developer
of one of Nashville's premier suburban office parks, the
400-acre Maryland Farms. "Banks have terminated lending to
people like us." Mr. Larish says his company, helped by its
ownership of the undeveloped land, will survive, though it
probably will need additional equity investment.
   But other developers have quit speculative work
completely. Third National Bank recently did a "friendly
foreclosure" on a 40-acre tract owned by Smiley &amp; Atchison
Investments. With a $6 million loan, the developer had bought
the open land to prepare it for speculative projects. David
Atchison, its chief executive, says the company will get out
of the business.
   Even though office-vacancy rates are only a bit above the
national average -- about 18% downtown and 23% in the suburbs
-- that is plenty high, and office rents are under pressure.
Building owners are finding it harder to pay off loans. In
1989 foreclosures began to snowball, and today nearly every
senior banker and every substantial developer in town spends
much of his time in painful conversations about a
foreclosure.
   The upshot is that hundreds of millions of dollars of
Nashville real estate is beginning to churn through the
banks. The looming problem: no buyers. "One thing about this
downswing, the opportunists aren't there," says Thomas Frye,
Third National's first vice president for commercial real
estate. The banks will probably have difficulty selling off
the properties. They have turned into real-estate owners,
with all the managerial headaches that entails.
   Predictably, in this nervous atmosphere, bankers are
afraid to lend. Entrepreneurs outside of the real-estate
fields notice a change in the mood.
   "The entrepreneur is the first to get slammed," says
Barney Byrd, who runs a leveraged-buy-out fund called Gen Cap
America that, in the past 18 months, acquired three small
Tennessee companies, each in roughly the $10 million range.
   But Mr. Byrd's most recent attempt to raise money fell
through. He thought he had a loan all sewed up from an
Atlanta outpost of Maryland National Bank, but the bank
called to say the loan office in Atlanta is closing down.
More or less giving up on finding bank loans in Nashville,
Mr. Byrd has turned to out-of-town financial houses, such as
Heller International.
   For untested entrepreneurs, getting a loan here is almost
impossible. And if the entrepreneur is a 30-year-old with no
credit history, forget it. That's what Joe Haze learned in
trying to buy Minuteman Press, a franchised printer here,
from his boss.
   Under the previous management, the Minuteman shop wasn't
aggressive about collecting debts, Mr. Haze says. It also was
late in paying its own bills; for example, it owes $5,000 to
its paper supplier.
   All told, Mr. Haze needs a $20,000 loan to get the shop
back on its feet. First American National Bank had lent
$10,000 to the previous owner but won't consider a loan to
Mr. Haze because he doesn't own a house or have credit cards.
   The young businessman has turned to a New Jersey loan
broker for help. In return for a $500 up-front fee, the
broker promised to help Mr. Haze find money. But the loan
never materialized, and the loan broker's phone has been
disconnected.

   Industrials Plunge 76.73, Reacting
   To Collapse in Overseas Markets

   NEW YORK -- Stocks plunged again as traders rushed to dump
shares before the close of trading.
   The slide took the Dow Jones Industrial Average below the
2500 level, ending at 2483.42, down 76.73 -- its lowest close
since July 1989.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Traders say no one wanted to go out of the market holding
stock for fear that some event overnight could shrink values
further.
   The market opened on a downdraft, reacting to a plunge in
share prices overseas. Tokyo stocks plummeted 5.8% Thursday,
the fourth largest one-day point drop in the market's
history. The Dow Jones industrials lost more than 72 points
in the first hour of trading.
   Even the oil stocks fell, with some issues tumbling back
below their levels before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, when oil
was about $20 a barrel. Oil stocks, in the face of rising oil
prices, have been resisting the market sell-off. Crude oil
futures yesterday rose to $31.93.
   Investors couldn't blame program trading for the day's
sell-off.
   Lazslo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, says
there was no evidence of program selling in the final hour of
trading when the industrial average plunged an additional 40
points.
   The New York Stock Exchange's "uptick" rule, which
restricts program trading when the Dow Jones industrials fall
50 points, went into effect at 9:54 a.m. EDT, remaining in
effect for the rest of the trading day.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 9.49 to 307.06,
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 5.34 to
168.88, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index lost 7.79
points to 285.31.
   Only 148 stocks advanced, while 1,645 stocks fell and 242
stocks ended unchanged.
   New York Stock Exchange volume surged to 250,440,000
shares -- bringing the heaviest day of trading since market
players awoke Aug. 2 to the news that Iraq had invaded
Kuwait. Wednesday, 175,550,000 shares were traded.
   Paul Hennessey, vice president of trading at Boston Co.,
said some traders had picked up stocks earlier in the day
hoping for a late session bounce. But when no bounce
materialized, those who held stock rushed to sell before the
close.
   The steep sell-off leaves the market in a position to
rebound early today if there is no bad news overnight, Mr.
Hennessey says. But with the reluctance among traders to hold
stock over the weekend, today's session could prove to be
equally volatile.
   Among the big oil stocks, Exxon gave back 1 3/4 to 49 5/8,
Chevron lost 3 to 75 5/8, Amoco dropped 1 7/8 to 55 3/4 and
Mobil lost 2 3/8 to 62 7/8.
   While analysts continue to consider the energy sector one
of the safest havens within the stock market, they say
investors looking to buy now should pick their stocks with
care.
   Bernard J. Picchi, oil analyst at Salomon Brothers,
cautions that many of the major oil companies have reached
price-earnings valuations well above their peaks during the
last oil-price surge of 1979-1980 when oil reached $40 a
barrel. And many of those companies are now more dependent on
income from their chemical businesses than they were back
then, he says.
   Higher oil prices are likely to squeeze the profits of
petrochemical and plastics operations, Mr. Picchi says, while
a general economic downturn could hurt the markets for those
products in general.
   "In 1980, almost no one {of the major oil companies} was
making money from chemicals, while last year, chemicals
contributed about 16% to the income of the nine largest oil
companies," Mr. Picchi says.
   He is recommending a handful of major oil companies and
refiners that could manage real gains, or will at least fall
less than other stocks.
   Atlantic Richfield and Texaco are Mr. Picchi's picks,
which he says are still cheap relative to other oil stocks
and have less exposure to the chemicals business.
   He also likes refiners Diamond Shamrock, Ashland Oil and
Valero Energy, pointing out that they are likely to benefit
from diminished refining capacity around the world in the
wake of the Middle East turmoil.
   Mr. Picchi estimates that the world has already lost about
1.2 million to 1.3 million barrels a day of refined products
such as gasoline, kerosene and home-heating oil because of
the embargo against Kuwaiti and Iraqi production.
   Meanwhile, U.S. refineries are operating at about 95% of
their capacity, he says.
   "The bottom line is that we are probably going to see
higher profit margins in refining for a longer period of time
than we would have thought possible before," he says.
   Texaco fell 3 5/8 to 60 1/8, while Atlantic Richfield rose
1/8 to 138 1/2. Diamond Shamrock lost 1/2 to 21 1/4, Ashland
Oil fell 1/2 to 31 1/4, and Valero Energy slipped 3/8 to 15.
   Eli Lilly slid 2 to 68 1/2, leading the most active list
on volume of more than 4.6 million shares. Medtronic said the
U.S. Court of Appeals vacated a lower court finding that
Medtronic infringed patents held by Eli Lilly. Medtronic fell
1 5/8 to 74 5/8.
   Insurance and financial services provider Transamerica
tumbled 3 3/8, or nearly 11%, to 30 on volume of more than
1.8 million shares. The company said it couldn't explain why
its stock has fallen further than the rest of the market. The
company said it still expects to report a strong year.
   The Federal National Mortgage Association lost only 1/8 to
26 5/8 on volume of more than 3.6 million shares. Fannie
Mae's announcement that it will buy back as much as $500
million of its common stock and warrants lent support to its
share price.
   Auto stocks fared better than the rest of the market.
General Motors lost only 3/8 to 36 1/4, Ford fell 1 1/8 to 33
1/8 and Chrysler dropped 1/4 to 12. Sales of U.S.-made cars
were better than expected in mid-August.
   Harken Energy rose 1/4 to 3 3/8. International Rectifier
added 3/8 to 8 3/8. The semiconductor maker reported profit
of 18 cents a share for the fiscal year ended in June,
compared with a loss of $1.13 a share in fiscal 1989. The
company said it expects "double-digit" revenue growth in
1991, with continued improvement in its operating profit.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index lost 8.54
to 315.85. Volume rose to 24,850,000 shares, compared with
16,570,000 shares Wednesday.

   Many Southern Baptists May Withhold
   Large Sums From Conservate Coffers
   ----
   By R. Gustav Niebuhr
   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
</HL>

</SO>
<LP>
   ATLANTA -- Some 3,000 dissident Southern Baptists are
discussing plans to withhold millions of dollars in annual
contributions from the Southern Baptist Convention, in what
some religious experts see as a first step toward their
pulling out of America's largest Protestant denomination
altogether.
   The Baptists, who are holding a three-day meeting in
Atlanta, represent the moderate faction of the denomination.
In recent years, they have become increasingly angered at the
conservative fundamentalist faction that has ruled the
denomination.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In discussions currently under way, the moderates are
proposing to set up a trust fund into which their churches
would funnel the money that is now being sent to the
denomination's coffers in Nashville, Tenn. The trust fund
would then spend the money on the moderates' own causes, such
as a possible new seminary. Using the trust fund, they could
bypass causes supported by the denomination's fundamentalist
leaders, such as the creation of a new religious right lobby
in Washington.
   The plan poses a direct threat to the denomination's
financial health -- and its conservative political clout --
because moderate churches have traditionally contributed far
more money to Southern Baptists headquarters than have
fundamentalist churches. Moderates estimate they contribute
at least 60%. This year's budget is about $137 million.
   The denomination's president, the Rev. Morris Chapman,
couldn't be reached for comment, nor could the denomination's
top financial officers. However, in a statement issued last
week, several top Southern Baptist leaders strongly warned
churches not to stop sending donations to headquarters,
warning that a lack of funds could lead to mass layoffs and
the shutdown of programs.
   Since fundamentalists took control of the denomination in
1979, moderates have charged that they have not been given a
fair voice in denomination affairs. Those who don't hold
certain conservative political and religious views -- such as
favoring school prayer, strictly opposing abortion, upholding
a literal interpretation of the Bible -- are penalized. They
have been shut out of leadership positions, and some have
even been fired.
   Angry at that situation, some moderates over the past year
have responded by cutting back on their contributions. As a
result, the denomination has had to curtail projects and lay
off some employees. In the event of an outright financial
rebellion, the denomination could find itself perilously
short on cash to support its vast missionary force and six
seminaries. The financial setback could also badly hurt the
denomination's powerful image as the religious right
powerhouse, an image that prompted conservative politicians
to court leading Baptist preachers and consider their
fundamentalist views in the 1980s.
   In addition, a declaration of financial independence by
moderates would inevitably generate momentum "toward the
forming of a new denomination," said Glenn Hinson, a
professor of church history at Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Louisville, Ky., who is attending the meeting.
Others said they expected the moderates to break from the
denomination as early as next year.
   One of the meeting's organizers, the Rev. William
Scarborough, pastor of National Heights Baptist Church in
Fayetteville, Ga., said the possibility of a schism seems to
appeal mostly to younger Baptists. "But for people like
myself, who have served in the Southern Baptist Convention
all our lives, it's really hard to think of going with
another church," he said.

   Keating Loses Initial Court Challenge
   Of Regulators' Seizure of Lincoln S&amp;L

   WASHINGTON -- A federal judge dismissed Charles Keating's
challenge to the government takeover of Lincoln Savings &amp;
Loan Association, saying that the Arizona executive and his
associates engaged in "skullduggery" to loot Lincoln of tens
of millions of dollars.
   Judge Stanley Sporkin's decision was a major victory for
the government and marked the first court test of federal
regulators' contentions that Mr. Keating wove elaborate
business schemes to transfer funds from Lincoln to its parent
company, American Continental Corp. The parent in turn paid
multimillion-dollar salaries to Mr. Keating, who is its
chairman, and other officials. The government has said the
failure of Lincoln, one of the biggest thrift debacles ever,
could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In a scathing 50-page decision, Judge Sporkin rejected Mr.
Keating's contention that overzealous and incompetent
government regulators harassed him for five years after he
bought Lincoln in 1984, and acted illegally in seizing the
thrift in April 1989.
   "It is abundantly clear that ACC's officials abused their
positions with respect to Lincoln," Judge Sporkin wrote,
adding: "Bluntly speaking, their actions amounted to a
looting of Lincoln. This was not done crudely. Indeed, it was
done with a great deal of sophistication."
   Government officials said that yesterday's clear victory
could help in a civil fraud suit the government has filed
seeking $1.1 billion from Mr. Keating and other Lincoln
executives. Some proceedings in that suit have been delayed
by the action before Judge Sporkin. "I think the ring is
closing around Mr. Keating," said William Seidman, chairman
of the Resolution Trust Corp., which filed the civil suit.
The Office of Thrift Supervision also has filed
administrative charges against Mr. Keating and five other
officials, seeking $40.9 million.
   Mr. Keating sued the government last year, contending that
the regulators had a vendetta against him for making risky
real estate and junk-bond investments outside the pale of the
traditional home mortgages held by thrifts. Judge Sporkin
brushed those claims aside and said that in a series of real
estate and securities transactions, American Continental's
actions in bleeding Lincoln of funds was like "an adult
taking candy from a helpless child."
   The decision came on a motion by the government to dismiss
the suit. Beginning in December, Judge Sporkin held more than
30 days of hearings, examining several of Lincoln's
transactions.
   In a statement yesterday in response to the decision,
American Continental said it was "reviewing all of its
options" and had "no comment at this time."
   In June, on the last day of the hearings, Mr. Keating said
he expected to appeal if the decision went against him.
However, perhaps heartened by Judge Sporkin's relentless
questioning of government witnesses during the proceedings,
he said: "I have full confidence that what this judge does
will be a fair and honest opinion, based on everything that
he's done. I realize I may be hanging myself with that
comment, but I believe that."
   Judge Sporkin, a former enforcement director at the
Securities and Exchange Commission known for his
outspokenness, had harsh words for Lincoln's accountants, in
particular Arthur Young &amp; Co., and attorneys who signed off
on complicated deals that he said had no "economic
substance." The judge said: "The system of accounting that
exists in the United States is in a sorry state" if Lincoln's
accountants were correct in approving the accounting of
certain deals.
   However, Judge Sporkin also praised one Arthur Young
accountant, Janice Vincent, for refusing to allow Lincoln to
record a profit, which Mr. Keating was "desperate" for, in a
complicated securities transaction. Arthur Young is now part
of Ernst &amp; Young.
   A spokesman for Ernst &amp; Young had no immediate comment
yesterday. When Arthur Young's actions were criticized in
congressional hearings last year, representatives of the firm
said their audits were "responsibly and professionally done."
   In one transaction in March 1987, for instance, Judge
Sporkin found that Lincoln provided $14 million in financing
to sell 1,000 acres it owned outside Phoenix, Ariz., though
Lincoln knew the buyer couldn't repay the debt "in any
realistic time frame." But because the book value of the land
was $3 million, Lincoln was able to record a gain of $11
million and $250,000 in accrued interest.

   Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., Hong Kong, reported that
first-half profit after taxes climbed 16% to 1.12 billion
Hong Kong dollars (US$143.9 million) from HK$964 million a
year earlier, buoyed by the strength of its core businesses.
   The conglomerate, controlled by the local tycoon Li Ka
Shing, said per-share earnings also grew 16% to 37 cents from
32 cents. But profit after extraordinary items fell 56% to
HK$1.49 billion, or 49 Hong Kong cents a share, from HK$3.42
billion, or HK$1.13 a share. The company recorded a one-time
gain of HK$368 million from the sale of its engineering
units, which was dwarfed by the HK$2.45 billion gain a year
earlier from the sale of shipping terminal interests.
Operating profit grew 11% to HK$1.25 billion from HK$1.13
billion.

   Revenue rose slightly to HK$6.4 billion from HK$6.34

   Tommy Thompson's GOP Star to Rise
   If He Thrives in Liberal Wisconsin

   MADISON, Wis. -- "No Sniveling]"
   Gov. Tommy Thompson's desk plate is like a shot across
your bow. No mealymouthing here, it warns, no pussyfooting
around. Lest its message be lost, there is a second sign
nearby:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "What part of NO don't you understand?"
   Here is the Republican whom Wisconsin Democrats call "Dr.
No." The man who used the line-item veto 615 times in only
three budget bills. Tough, but disarmingly gregarious at the
same time, he'd make a good barroom bouncer. That's because
he was a barroom bouncer, while working his way through the
University of Wisconsin.
   To conservative admirers, 48-year-old Gov. Thompson also
is a potential GOP star of the future -- if as expected he
wins re-election against a solid Democratic candidate in a
state that went for Michael Dukakis only two years ago. Gov.
Thompson has built a reputation as a conservative
problem-solver. Yet he has managed to remain popular in this
bastion of progressive-to-liberal politics -- more popular,
at one point, than Milwaukee Brewers slugger Robin Yount.
   "Tommy is an example of an activist conservative," says
House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich. "He's open to
conservative solutions, not just conservative opposition."
   Assertively "pro-business," Gov. Thompson has cut
Wisconsin's capital gains, income and inheritance taxes. He
now enjoys partial credit for an economic resurgence that has
created 250,000 new nonfarm jobs during his first term. Yet
he's been unable to deliver in a major way on a 1986 campaign
pledge to provide state relief for soaring local property
taxes. Challenger Tom Loftus calculates property taxes will
jump $1 billion during the governor's first term and is
making that jump his prime issue.
   "The rich have gotten tax breaks, the middle class has
gotten property-tax increases," says Mr. Loftus, who's
speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly.
   In 1987, Tommy Thompson cemented a friendship with then
Vice President George Bush by volunteering for a wild
speedboat ride with Mr. Bush at the helm. Like Mr. Bush, Gov.
Thompson hasn't run against government. "I think you can be a
conservative and still like government," he says. What he's
done instead is pursue some traditional governmental
objectives in untraditional ways.
   Politically, meanwhile, he has driven wedges between
elements of the Democratic coalition -- between the teachers
union and parents, for example, and between the '60s-style
liberals of Madison and the more conservative Democrats of
Milwaukee. Two social programs, Learnfare and Choice,
illustrate his approach.
   Learnfare cuts welfare payments to adults if their
teen-agers cut school. Learnfare is politically popular, and
the governor hopes to extend the concept down to the
six-year-old level.
   Much to Gov. Thompson's frustration, however, a legal
challenge held up Learnfare's application to Milwaukee County
and its concentration of welfare recipients. At issue was the
flawed record-keeping system of the Milwaukee public school
system, which makes it hard to document when a given pupil
was in school and when he wasn't.
   "How in the hell," fumes the governor, "can they run a
school system when they can't tell you who's attending and
who's not?" The challenge now appears resolved in time for
this school year.
   Choice, a first-in-the-nation pilot program, spends
taxpayer money to send children to private, non-sectarian
schools. So far, it affects just under 1,000 low-income grade
school and high school students in Milwaukee. But it
represents a pointed challenge to the public school
establishment: Shape up, or watch your pupils ship out.
   Choice is bitterly opposed by the Wisconsin Education
Association Council, as well as the state superintendent,
Herbert Grover. "We're going to have two school systems in
this state and both paid for by public money," he recently
declared. "One will have accountability and one won't."
   Gov. Thompson relishes the uproar. "The teachers union
can't stand competition," he says. "If we succeed in this,
the eyes of the nation will be on us."
   The evolution of Choice is a good illustration of the
Thompson governing style. He didn't invent the idea, whose
key backer was Polly Williams, a black Democratic legislator
from Milwaukee. But he latched on to it, making it his own.
   "I don't see an innovative guy, I see a very pragmatic
guy," observes Charles O. Jones, a University of Wisconsin
political scientist. "He's partisan but not ideological. He
takes his opportunities as they present themselves."
   "His manner and his technique are very down-home
Wisconsin," says Washington conservative activist David
Keene, a friend since he and Mr. Thompson championed a truly
lonely cause -- Barry Goldwater -- in their University of
Wisconsin days. "But he has this single-minded quality."
   Democratic opponent Tom Loftus is in many ways the
governor's polar opposite: a classic liberal Democrat and
proud of it. "The election of 1990 will determine if
Wisconsin is the progressive state of the 21st century or a
state with a once-proud past now sliding towards average," he
told a rally here. The self-described underdog has a shot at
an upset, given the property-tax issue and the strength of
the state Democratic party. But the earnest, issues-oriented
Mr. Loftus is no match for the governor as a campaigner.
   Earlier this month, Gov. Thompson was in Milwaukee
harvesting the endorsements of three veteran Democrats who
helped build the modern Wisconsin Democratic Party. One was
ex-Mayor Henry Maier, a legend after governing Milwaukee for
28 years. Mr. Thompson's satisfied grin faded only slightly
when the ever-crusty Mr. Maier described him as a man with
just one weakness. "He should either shave or use makeup to
combat his three-o'clock shadow."
   Then it was off to the Wisconsin State Fair. Cowboy hat on
head, Mr. Thompson auctioned off champion livestock as a
figure in a pink hog costume, Willy B. Bacon, whipped up the
bidders. Then, after recuperating at a beer tent, the
governor hit the midway.
   With his police escort dutifully trailing along behind, he
slid down the giant slide, got soaked on a bumper boat, rode
the Ferris wheel, the double Ferris wheel, the roller coaster
and every other ride in sight. Fairgoers rushed over to give
him high-fives, to ply him with food, to hug him and pose for
snapshots.
   It was 1:30 a.m. when Tommy Thompson finally rolled up to
the executive mansion, clutching the cowboy hat like a
trophy.

also said Castle &amp; Cooke hasn't set a time limit on the
possible sale or spin-off of its Dole Food Co. unit. Castle &amp;
Cooke has said it has been contacted by several major
companies interested in acquiring Dole Food. It has retained
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to help evaluate a possible sale of the
unit.
   Castle &amp; Cooke had first planned to spin off Dole Food
into a new publicly traded company. That plan has been on
hold since May, however, because of financing concerns and
uncertainty over the tax treatment of the transaction.

   WASHINGTON -- A comprehensive Food and Drug Administration
review of research on a synthetic growth hormone reinforces
earlier FDA assertions that milk and meat from dairy cattle
treated with the product are safe for human consumption.
   The FDA study, being published today in the journal
Science, should help dispel consumer concerns about the
genetically engineered product, bovine growth hormone, which
is injected into cows to boost milk production.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   FDA officials are intent on explaining why they authorized
the sale of milk from BGH-treated cows in 1985 when they
approved field tests of the hormone. BGH has yet to be
approved for commercial use.
   The authors of the report say that analysis of more than
120 studies has led the agency to conclude that use of BGH
presents "no increased health risk to consumers."
   In their report, Judith Juskevich, a former FDA
toxicologist and pharmacologist, and C. Greg Guyer, a chemist
in the agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine, also cite
previously unpublished data from 16 studies underwritten by
biotechnology companies seeking FDA approval to begin
marketing BGH.
   These data, among other things, show that BGH is harmless
because it breaks down into inactive fragments in the
gastrointestinal tract while being digested, and that
pasteurization destroys 90% of the BGH in milk, according to
the scientists.
   While the findings aren't surprising, the new study is
unusual in several respects. "It's unprecedented for the FDA
to publish such an assessment of scientific data on a drug
before it is approved," said Jeffrey Nesbit, chief spokesman
for the FDA. Submitting data to peer review by a panel of
experts -- in this instance, appointed by the editors of
Science -- is also unprecedented for the agency, he said.
   BGH is one of the most promising products of recombinant
DNA technology. Commercial batches can be produced by
genetically engineered bacteria for injection in cows twice a
month. In farm trials, milk yields have jumped 10% to 25%.
BGH, also called bovine somatotropin, is biologically
identical to the natural growth hormone produced by the cow's
pituitary gland.
   Some consumer advocates and medical experts have
questioned the validity of the safety studies. As a result,
some of the nation's largest milk processors and distributors
have backed away from BGH, refusing to handle milk from
BGH-treated herds. Nonetheless, Monsanto Co. and other
developers of the synthetic hormone are still counting on a
$500 million-a-year global market for BGH. Publication of the
FDA study in a journal as prestigious as Science lends
credibility to their claims regarding the product's safety.
   But the new study "won't speed up or deter the approval of
BGH," Mr. Nesbit said. FDA clearance for commercial use is
expected sometime next year.

   Royal Nedlloyd Group N.V. reported a 76% plunge in its
first-half profit and said it wouldn't pay an interim
dividend.
   The transport giant, which is based in Rotterdam, the
Netherlands, said profit collapsed to 26.8 million guilders
($15.3 million), or 1.40 guilders (80 cents) a share, from
112.7 million guilders, or 6.47 guilders a share, a year
earlier. The latest half's net included 95.6 million guilders
of profit from sales of assets, including a tanker and
Japanese real estate. Without those asset sales, Nedlloyd
would have reported a substantial loss.
</LP>

   "These results are horrible," said Jan Stoop, a securities
salesman at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Nederland N.V. in
Amsterdam. "The outlook does not look particularly good." The
profit drop was bigger than most analysts expected, despite
Nedlloyd's warning this month that its performance was
deteriorating.
   The results were announced after the close of trading on
the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, where Nedlloyd shares closed at
54.3 guilders, down from 56.5 guilders, in a generally weak
market.
   Nedlloyd said it expects that its net for the full year
will be "considerably below" the 146 million guilders
forecast this year. For 1989, the company reported net of 252
million guilders, including about 106 million guilders of
exceptional items.

   Scott Paper, One of Industry's Buoyant Few,
   Seen by Some as Just About Recession-Proof

   PHILADELPHIA -- As the stock market sinks into the depths
on fears of war and recession, why is Scott Paper one of the
few paper companies bobbing along with only a minor dip?
   It can't be the company's earnings. The maker of bathroom
tissue, paper towels and printing papers earned about $4.11 a
share last year before one-time gains, almost the same as in
1988 and well below the $5 some analysts expected. And this
year's first-half earnings of $1.83 a share were 11% below
the year-ago profit, prompting even the most bullish analysts
to project another flat full year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It isn't the dividend that's attracting investors; Scott
yields a modest 1.8%. Clearly, it isn't the state of the
paper industry, which is in the midst of a cyclical downturn.
Nor is the Street abuzz about the double-digit earnings
growth Scott has achieved under Philip E. Lippincott who, in
1983, became chief executive officer and began to revitalize
the company.
   What is buoying Scott's stock is a widespread belief that
the company is just about recession-proof. Never mind that
paper-products companies' stocks are down 17% since year end
and that the market is off 13%, as measured by the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index. Scott is down less than 3% year-to-date,
despite a 2 1/4 drop yesterday to 43 7/8.
   The case for the stock is simple: "Tissue is more
necessary than discretionary," says Gary Palmero, an
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst. If anything, he says, Scott should
see demand surge, as its new machines in France, Italy, and
Spain come on line and it assimilates a recently acquired 51%
of Feldmuhle AG's European tissue operations. Use of sanitary
tissue products is growing steadily in Western Europe, where
it now stands at 15 pounds a year per capita compared with
more than 39 pounds for Americans.
   Costs are declining for pulp, the tree fibers used to make
paper. List prices for one benchmark pulp grade are off $40 a
ton from last year's peak and heading lower, says Evadna Lynn
of Dean Witter Reynolds.
   Ms. Lynn recently began following Scott with a strong
"buy" recommendation. She estimates that every $50-a-ton drop
in pulp prices adds about 25 cents a share to the company's
final profit.
   Although costly production snafus have dogged Scott's
printing paper division, "the problems are diminishing," says
George Adler of Smith Barney. He expects Scott to earn about
$4.75 a share in 1991.
   The stock is a bargain at yesterday's level of about 10
times estimated earnings for 1990, Mr. Adler says. "The
market is taking a `show me' attitude," he says. Even
Kimberly-Clark, a recent favorite of recession-wary
investors, is comparatively expensive at about 12 times this
year's estimate of earnings before a one-time charge.
   As the market recognizes Scott's value, Mr. Adler says, he
sees Scott's share price rising to about $55 in the next six
months and to "at least" $65 by the end of 1991.
   But some analysts caution that Scott's recent performance
has so far offered little proof of its supposed potential.
Furthermore, the bears say Scott isn't quite as
recession-resistant as some investors believe.
   Scott is particularly vulnerable to a downturn in the
market for its cash cow, printing papers, says Bruce Kirk, an
analyst with S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. In 1989, 44% of Scott's
pretax operating profit came from that division.
   "In some way, shape or form, coated paper ends up in
advertising-related businesses" such as magazines and
catalogs, Mr. Kirk says, adding: "If the economy in general
is soft, the advertising is sluggish with it, and coated
paper doesn't grow."
   Rival makers of coated paper will be adding new machines
in the next two years, threatening overcapacity.
"Coated-paper prices will come under pressure," says Sherman
Chao of Salomon Brothers. In the tissue business, Europe
could become a profitless battleground if Kimberly, Scott,
James River and European companies slash prices to capture
market share.
   Meanwhile, skeptics contend that investors in the stock
may be setting themselves up for a beating on the next poor
earnings report. "Investors have been willing to give Scott
Paper and its management the benefit of the doubt, saying
`Let's wait one more quarter,'" Mr. Chao asserts. "At some
point, someone is going to give up," he adds.

   Burke Fired as CBS News President;
   Ober to Take Over Struggling Division

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- CBS News President David W. Burke was fired,
thrusting the embattled news division into another period of
uncertainty, with possible layoffs.
   Mr. Burke, 54 years old, was forced out by CBS Inc.
President Laurence A. Tisch only two years after he was hired
to guide CBS News out of a long period of turmoil. He clashed
often with top management, most recently over the news
division's ballooning budget, his own autonomy and the
suspension of commentator Andy Rooney. Mr. Burke will be
succeeded by Eric Ober, 48, who is president of the CBS-owned
television stations division.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Ober, a highly regarded executive who has been a vice
president in the news division, faces a daunting job. He must
revive CBS's nightly newscast, which has fallen significantly
in ratings, and steer CBS News back to journalistic dominance
in an era of shrinking financial resources and limited
patience by top management.
   The CBS News budget already is running far in excess of
spending targets for this year. As of Aug. 18, the division
already had spent about $300 million -- its spending plan for
all of 1990, according to insiders. Two years ago that figure
for an entire year was deemed so extravagant by Mr. Tisch
that he ordered a round of budget cuts and the layoff of 215
CBS News employees.
   But Mr. Ober, Brooklyn-born and educated at Yale, said he
hasn't been given any mandate to cut the division's annual
budget. "My top priority," Mr. Ober said, "is letting the
news organization go about covering the news. No one has
discussed anything about budgets with me. They've only
discussed the job."
   Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group and
Mr. Burke's predecessor at CBS News, declined to say what
measures CBS will take to offset the spending splurge this
year. CBS News, with about 1,370 employees, is the largest of
the three network news operations.
   But Mr. Stringer said questions about possible layoffs and
spending cuts were "unfair" because of a pending review of
the budget for next year. However, he said that he was
"totally confident" that the 1991 budget will be "larger than
ever."
   Mr. Burke, who shielded himself from CBS News employees
and the press during much of his tenure, didn't return calls
to his office and home. His abrupt dismissal contrasted
sharply with his arrival July 13, 1988, when he left the No.
2 job at ABC News and was welcomed warmly by CBS's Mr. Tisch
at a packed news conference, while cameras flashed. Mr. Tisch
said then that he finally had the right management team in
place, two full years after acquiring control of the
broadcast company.
   But yesterday, senior CBS officials went out of their way
to say they had forced Mr. Burke out, rather than let him
leave of his own accord. Insisting on anonymity, they said
while the news budget was the most recent sticking point, Mr.
Burke's abrupt exit also stems from what they contend was "a
lack of leadership" and continual clashes with CBS brass,
including senior vice president Jay Kriegel.
   "You have to earn independence," said one senior CBS
official. "Burke wanted it immediately."
   In a statement, Mr. Burke said, "It is clear to me,
following amicable discussions with the management of CBS,
that they would be more comfortable about the future of the
news division under new leadership. They have a right to make
that decision, and I intend fully to cooperate in transition
of leadership responsibilities."
   Mr. Burke often didn't inform executives at Black Rock,
CBS's corporate headquarters, of such major moves as hiring
away Paula Zahn from rival ABC -- at a salary of $1 million
-- to co-anchor "CBS This Morning." He also made it clear
that he didn't want his predecessor and boss, Mr. Stringer,
roaming the halls of the CBS News building, where Mr.
Stringer spent his entire career.
   Mr. Ober, however, has close working relationships with
senior executives at headquarters. And, while Mr. Burke
didn't rub shoulders with CBS News staffers, Mr. Ober is
well-liked and gregarious. When he walks through any of the
five CBS-owned stations (he has worked at three of them) he
is given something akin to a hero's welcome.
   His open style belies a reputation as a shrewd businessman
and tough negotiator with on-air talent and syndicators of
television shows.
   The decision to oust Mr. Burke came last week. "This was
building up," said one CBS executive. The firing was imposed
in the midst of a major news story -- the conflict in Iraq --
because "that conflict could go on for four years. We had to
move at CBS News," the executive said.
   Mr. Stringer said he and Mr. Ober, a 24-year CBS veteran,
had talked about the management shift with CBS News anchor
Dan Rather, who was in Saudi Arabia yesterday, "and Eric has
Dan's full support."
   Mr. Ober said he plans no major changes for the "CBS
Evening News with Dan Rather," despite its slipping to second
place in the ratings behind "ABC World News Tonight with
Peter Jennings," which has been a solid No. 1 for 33 weeks.
"I would hope to expand CBS News in terms of prime-time
shows," Mr. Ober said, "but first things first. My intention
is to go in and help" the nightly newscast.
   Mr. Stringer concurred: "It's no fun being No. 2."

   Hang Seng Bank Ltd. reported that consolidated profit
after taxes and transfers to inner reserves spurted 17% to
651 million Hong Kong dollars (US$83.7 million) in the first
half from HK$556 million (US$71 million) a year earlier,
helped by the modest rebound of the local economy.
   The bank, a unit of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp.,
said share earnings rose 17% to 65.7 cents from 56.2 cents.
Its directors proposed raising the interim dividend to 27
cents from 22.5 cents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hang Seng, based in Hong Kong, cited improved deposits and
loans, driven by the local economy's improvement over the
course of the half. It expects its full-year dividend to
reach at least HK$1.20 following 1989's HK$1 payout.
   Keith Wu, senior research manager at Citicorp Scrimgeour
Vickers Hong Kong Ltd., termed the results "extremely
encouraging," and reflective of the group's success in
capitalizing on high interest rates.
   Mr. Wu said the bank generally manipulates its figures so
it can report a stronger performance in the second half than
the interim period. But he quickly dismissed the notion that
the results portend well for its parent, which reports
Tuesday and is expected to be hard hit by its operations in
the U.S. and Australia.

   Opts Out of Provision
   On Interstate Banking

   BOSTON -- Bank of Boston Corp. said its directors voted to
opt out of provisions of the recently passed Massachusetts
interstate banking law that allows banks outside of New
England to acquire or open banks in the state.
   The statute, signed into law in July, allows a
Massachusetts bank to opt out of the interstate banking
provisions until July 1, 1992, by a two-thirds vote of its
directors.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Prior to the passage of the law, only banks based in other
New England states have been able to enter the Massachusetts
market. Bank of Boston officials had lobbied against the
interstate banking bill and had previously indicated they
would opt out under the provisions until 1992.
   In a statement, Bank of Boston said, "This decision is
consistent with the corporation's intention to remain an
independent institution and with its strategic objective to
build long-term stockholder value."
   The company added that the "action wasn't taken in
response to any known proposal to acquire Bank of Boston
Corp."
   The bank holding company's stock price has been depressed
recently because of poor results due to the slumping New
England economy and real estate market.
   BayBanks Inc., another bank holding company buffeted by
New England's economic woes, chose to opt out of the the
provisions last month, but retained the right to "opt in"
before 1992 if it deems it "advisable."

   FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Shrugging off the bad news
that's driving down the German stock and bond markets, the
mark soared to a record high against the staggering dollar.
   In New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5400
marks, its lowest level since the West German currency was
created in 1948, before climbing fractionally to 1.5444 marks
late in the day, compared with 1.5590 marks late Wednesday.
At the official fixing in Frankfurt yesterday, the dollar had
been pegged at 1.5432 marks, down more than a pfennig from
Wednesday. Traders here expect the trend to continue, with
some predicting the dollar may fall below 1.50 marks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At mid-morning in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at
146.08 yen, up from 145.88 yen at the close there Thursday.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.5515 marks, down
from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.5564 marks.
   The threat of war in the Mideast and $30-a-barrel oil, if
anything, appear to be helping the German currency thrive.
Even Bonn's own problems such as the soaring costs of
unification and fears about inflation, which have sent German
equity and bond markets reeling, haven't damped enthusiasm
for the mark.
   Currency experts agree that the mark, along with a handful
of other European currencies, has replaced -- at least for
now -- the dollar in its traditional role as the haven for
investors in times of crisis. Currency traders consider West
Germany better insulated from oil-price increases than the
U.S. or Japan. The Swiss franc and sterling, which has the
status of a petrocurrency, have fared even better than the
mark.
   The dollar also fell to a new low against the Swiss franc
in New York yesterday: It was quoted late in the day at
1.2553 francs, down from 1.2780 francs late Wednesday. The
dollar's previous low against the franc, reached Jan. 4,
1988, was 1.2675 francs.
   Meanwhile, the pound climbed to $1.9555 from $1.9240 late
Wednesday. Against the yen, the dollar slipped to 146.15 yen
from 146.30 yen.
   If the strong mark has West German exporters feeling the
pinch, they can expect little relief in the form of interest
rate cuts or other intervention from the Bundesbank. In fact,
the Bundesbank sees the strong mark as a help in keeping
inflation in check by depressing the price of imports. At the
same time, it expects the effect on exporters to be offset by
surging demand from East Germany.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve, meanwhile, pressured by the Bush
administration to hold down U.S. interest rates lest an
increase hurt economic growth, has shown little inclination
to intervene, since the weak dollar helps shrink U.S. trade
deficits by making exports cheaper.
   "It's no secret that we see this {the strong mark} as
working to our advantage," says one Bundesbank official. The
rise in oil prices comes at a time when Germany faces an
inflationary threat from the increasing amount of funds that
Bonn is pumping into East Germany to support the East's
crumbling economy.
   Some analysts, in fact, say such inflation fears may
pressure the German central bank to increase interest rates.
And speculation of a West German increase while U.S. rates
stay steady has contributed to the mark's strength.
   Further jumps in oil prices plus the costs of East German
unification could boost German inflation to more than 3% in
the coming months, from 2.4% currently, says Geoffrey Dennis,
chief international economist for James Capel &amp; Co. in
London. That, in turn, could push the Bundesbank to raise
interest rates "by the end of the year," he says.
   Prof. Ruediger Pohl, who is on the five-member panel of
economists regularly advising the Bonn government, observes
that short-term market interest rates are close to the
Bundesbank's 8% Lombard rate, under which banks borrow
short-term funds. The Lombard, two full points above the
discount rate, serves as the upper reference point for German
money-market rates.
   "I can imagine that the Bundesbank might want to create a
little more upward maneuvering room" by lifting the Lombard
and thus allowing market rates to drift higher," Prof. Pohl
said. "Many things depend on what happens in the Gulf, but
the inflation risks from East Germany are greater than many
imagine," he said.
   Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl declared in July that
the central bank's timing for monetary policy moves isn't
influenced by electoral politics. Yet Bonn officials assert
that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would take a dim view of a rate
increase shortly before the all-German elections in December.
"Particularly," adds Prof. Pohl, "when the government still
insists that the costs are manageable."
   Although West German shares have joined the global drop in
equity markets, investors pulling out of the stock market are
remaining in mark interest-bearing accounts for one of the
best interest-rate margins anywhere.
   Analysts agree, however, that the dollar could stage a
comeback if there were a quick resolution of the Mideast
conflict, a brisk reversal in oil prices and a resurgence in
the U.S. economy -- preferably without U.S. interest-rate
cuts. Until then, the dollar is a bad bet.
   "Basically, the dollar's fall hasn't ended," says Michael
Koch, treasurer of the Bank of America's Frankfurt branch.
"We're going to see DM1.50 before its over. Before that you
can't expect the Bundesbank to step in {with intervention}.
It's not in their interest."
   But there are risks. With Bonn's borrowing requirement
multiplying to support East Germany, interest rates should
remain high whatever the Bundesbank does. Tighter credit
could hamper Germany's tricky economic adjustment after
unification on Oct. 3 by reining in growth and lifting the
price of crucial industrial investment. The result could
further pummel West German equity and bond markets.
   Even as the mark rose yesterday, West German shares
tracked the world-wide drop in equities. The DAX Index of
West German shares plunged another 54.76 points, or 3.4%, to
end at 1520.34.
   Even a previous day's statement by Kuwaiti Finance
Minister Sheik Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah that he has instructed
West German banks to increase Kuwait's holdings in West
German equity failed to spur investor confidence in equities.
   But with a real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rate of
about 6.6%, or the difference between the current 9% one-year
money market rate and July's 2.4% inflation rate, the mark
remains king.
   "It's one of the many puzzles at the moment," says Mr.
Dennis of James Capel. "The main explanation is that the
equity market is being pressured by factors that favor the
currency."
   Separately, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
for current delivery settled at $412 an ounce, up $1.
Estimated volume was a heavy six million ounces.
   In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$411.05 an ounce.

   Tokyo Shares Plunge 5.8%, Leaving Traders
   Wondering How Low Stock Market Will Plummet

   Tokyo stocks plummeted 5.8% Thursday, registering the
fourth largest one-day point drop in the market's history.
   London shares ended lower but managed to finish above the
day's low after Wall Street made a slight recovery from steep
losses in its first hour of trading.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The slide in Tokyo, which accelerated after Wednesday's 4%
plunge, had traders wondering how low the market can go.
"People are panicking," says Craig Chudler, strategist at
UBS-Phillips &amp; Drew Securities Ltd. "We're looking at a
meltdown scenario." From the moment trading began Thursday
morning, the Nikkei Index continued its tailspin, falling
more than 1000 points in the first two hours. The Nikkei
finished the day at 23737.63, down 1473.28 points. An
estimated 450 million shares changed hands, up slightly from
397.7 million Wednesday.
   In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rebounded 348.12 points
to close the morning session at 24085.75.
   In Thursday's trading, decliners towered over advancers
927-14, while 18 issues were unchanged. The Tokyo Stock Price
Index of all issues listed in the first section dropped
110.58 points, or 5.7%, to 1829.25.
   The Second Section Index took a 204.17-point nosedive, or
5.3%, to 3634.15. Volume was estimated at 7.7 million shares,
down from 9.2 million Wednesday.
   Analysts said the plunge in stock prices reflected the
dismal performance of the Tokyo bond market. The benchmark
No. 119 issue of 10-year Japanese government bonds fell 0.82
to 82.14, for a yield of 8.305%, a 0.195 percentage point
gain. It is the highest government bond yield in a decade.
   The bond market, in turn, was battered by the Japanese
government's decision to go ahead with an 800 billion yen
($5.48 billion) bond sale Wednesday despite the market's
jitters. Analysts had been warning for days that if Japan's
Ministry of Finance pushed ahead with the auction few
investors would respond. The dire predictions proved accurate
from the moment selling began; the auction drew little better
than half the number of bidders who participated in a similar
sale in July.
   "It's clear that the Ministry of Finance doesn't give a
damn about the stock market," one U.S. analyst said of the
decision to proceed with the bond sale.
   The sluggish bond market aggravated investors' already
acute fears about rising interest rates and escalating
tensions in the Persian Gulf, according to analysts. "As long
as we continue to face serious uncertainties in the Middle
East, conditions for a long-term depressed atmosphere will
prevail," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, an economist at Salomon
Brothers Inc.
   But Thursday's fall also may have been the product of
panic selling by individual investors trading on margin. The
poor performance of usually stable issues such as Sony,
Nintendo and Nippon Steel -- bluechip stocks that are the
favorites of small investors -- lend credence to that
interpretation. Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone, another
favorite among individual investors, closed at a record low
of 851,000 yen a share, down a whopping 99,000.
   After the market slid in March, regulatory authorities at
the Tokyo Stock Exchange reduced the margin requirement for
investors to 40% of their equity holdings. That change buoyed
the market for a time because it enabled individuals to buy
more stocks on borrowed money. But now many of those
investors find themselves in the lurch as the value of their
portfolio spirals downward, prompting banks and securities
houses to call in loans.
   Exchange officials "played a dangerous game earlier by
easing margin requirements," says Mr. Chudler of
UBS-Phillips. "In effect, they transfered shares from strong
investors to weak investors. The big risk was share prices
would decline."
   But some analysts interpreted panic selling by individuals
as a positive sign. The drop in blue-chip stock prices
"indicates that this is a final sale phenomenon," says Akira
Suzuki, an economist at Morgan Stanley Group Inc. Mr. Suzuki
remains bullish on the Tokyo market's long-term prospects
despite its troubles since Iraqi tanks stormed across the
Kuwaiti border Aug. 2.
   A small number of market participants seem to share that
upbeat sentiment. Amid the past week's decline, a few bullish
investors have been snatching up bargains. Officials at Shuwa
Corp., a property-investment concern, Wednesday confirmed
that in recent days the company has boosted its holdings of
Isetan to slightly more than 48 million shares, giving Shuwa
a 21.9% stake in the retailing giant and making it the
chain's largest holder.

   THE U.S. FACED a crucial test in Kuwait over Iraq's threat
to close embassies.
   As the Bush administration's war of nerves with the Iraqis
intensified over Saddam Hussein's order that Western
embassies in Kuwait shut down today -- and with most vowing
they will remain open -- the U.S. acted to forge a global
effort to aid nations hurt by the embargo of Iraq. U.S.
officials analyzed the needs of Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, and
Bush reportedly asked Japan's Kaifu to help some nations.
Israeli military sources said Jordanian officers have been
training Iraqis to use U.S.-made Hawk anti-aircraft missiles
captured from Kuwait. And Kuwaiti officials said Baghdad has
mined most of Kuwait's oil wells and threatened to blow them
up if there is an attack.

   Triton Energy Corp. reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss
of $34.6 million, or $1.77 a share, largely reflecting asset
writedowns. The loss in the quarter ended May 31 included a
gain of $439,000, or two cents a share, from tax-loss
carryforward.
   The Dallas oil and gas exploration concern said it took a
charge of $31.1 million for the write-down of certain assets
in connection with a restructuring plan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Michael P. McInerney said the restructuring
was unrelated to a possible buy-out bid by New Zealand
investor Sir Ronald Brierly, who has accumulated 10.9% of
Triton.
   Fourth-quarter revenue fell 15% to $67.7 million from
$79.8 million in the year-earlier period, when Triton had net
income of $2.2 million, or five cents a share.
   For the year, Triton recorded a net loss of $54.2 million,
or $2.93 a share, on revenue of $260.1 million after
recording a $593,000, or three cent-a-share, extraordinary
gain from tax-loss carry-forward. A year earlier, Triton had
a net loss of $12.5 million, or 87 cents a share, on revenue
of $242.3 million. Those figures included a $534,000, or
three cent-a-share, extraordinary gain from tax-loss
carry-forwards.

   And Just Wait Until They Get
   The Bill From the Five Justices

   How many lawyers does it take to run a bar association?
Five, provided they are Utah Supreme Court Justices.
   In an unprecedented ruling, the Utah Supreme Court put the
5,000-member Utah State Bar in what amounts to a kind of
receivership after finding the bar was mired in a growing
budget deficit with no clear plan to extricate itself.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   An audit found that in each of the past five fiscal years,
the bar spent as much as 30% more money than it received in
dues -- which have been increased by about 90% over the past
four years.
   Petitioned by angry lawyers, the state Supreme Court
ordered the bar to cut its expenses by about 15%, and forever
desist from deficit spending and short-term borrowing against
dues revenue.
   "It's about time," says Brian M. Barnard, a Salt Lake City
lawyer who is something of a bar gadfly. Two years ago, Mr.
Barnard filed suit against the bar in federal court, claiming
his mandatory dues were being spent on "frivolous things that
are nonessential to the practice of law."
   His suit is still pending, but Mr. Barnard says he may
withhold his claims now that the Supreme Court has acted.
   Mr. Barnard says the bar's most frivolous expenditure was
the construction three years ago of a $3.5 million "Law and
Justice Center," which serves as the bar's headquarters. The
building was also designed to house facilities for
out-of-court legal arbitration sessions.
   Says Mr. Barnard: "That was just a ruse. If you want to do
arbitration, you can get a free room at the public library.
The building was just a way to help inflate the egos of the
bar commissioners."
   The bar's public relations consultant, John Becker,
bristles at Mr. Barnard's charge, and points out the building
has been praised by the American Bar Association as a
prototype facility and program "to make the system of justice
more open to the public."
   Nevertheless, the bar still owes money for construction of
the building, partly because private donations to the project
fell short of what the bar anticipated, and because some
lawyers who pledged money to help pay for construction later
reneged on their pledges.
   Mr. Barnard calls the situation "lamentable," and worries
that it creates a negative image. "If you're looking for a
lawyer for some advice in a financial matter, maybe it's
relevant how they mind their own store," he says.

   Malaysia to Keep
   Its Preferential
   Trade Status

   Petitions Seeking to Rescind
   Asian Nation's Privileges
   Rejected by Washington

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- This Southeast Asian nation will
retain its preferential trade status with the U.S., thanks in
part to a strong endorsement from the American Embassy here.
   The U.S. Trade Representative's office in Washington,
D.C., asserting that Malaysia is increasing its protection of
workers' rights, has rejected three petitions filed by U.S.
labor organizations seeking to rescind the country's trade
privileges under the Generalized System of Preferences.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The petitions pointed to alleged abuses of workers'
rights, especially within the foreign-dominated electronics
industry, as grounds for canceling the reduced-tariff and
duty-free benefits on certain Malaysian goods shipped to the
U.S.
   The campaign to end Malaysia's special status had been
encouraged by the controversial behavior of a U.S.-owned
company in a recent labor dispute, the leaking of a number of
confidential memorandums implicating U.S. concerns in
concerted efforts to keep their Malaysian facilities
union-free, and Kuala Lumpur's former absolute ban on unions
in the electronics sector.
   A U.S. trade official in Washington said the petitions --
submitted by the AFL-CIO, the privately funded International
Labor Rights Education and Research Fund and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers -- "were not
accepted because no substantial or new information was
provided to warrant further review."
   The ruling doesn't come as a surprise. Trade and labor
analysts, including several who supported the petitions, had
said all along it was unlikely the U.S. would revoke the
preferential status of an ally and significant trading
partner. In 1989, about 8% of Malaysia's $12.65 billion
(US$4.69 billion) in exports to the U.S. came under the GSP,
while the U.S. shipped goods valued at M$10.3 billion to
Malaysia.
   Also, a confidential assessment by the U.S. Embassy here
-- a copy of which was obtained from Washington -- disputed
allegations by the three American labor groups and backed
continued GSP benefits for Malaysia. Parties associated with
the trade action said that the embassy's favorable review was
a significant factor in persuading the trade office to reject
the petitions.
   The embassy's assessment flatly rejected the views
contained in the petitions: "In our view, none of them
present any new, relevant issues for review. The Malaysian
government has continued to take steps to provide
internationally accepted worker rights to its citizens."
   An announcement by the trade representative's office had
been expected more than a month ago. But the heavy caseload
of petitions, as well as the U.S. Labor Department's concerns
about alleged rights violations in Malaysia, delayed the
ruling, said labor analysts familiar with the proceedings.
   One analyst said that "the guys from Labor were the only
ones that said you can't dismiss these {petitions} that
lightly. . . . They said this needs to be looked at
seriously."
   Though the odds were slim and the potential economic
impact marginal, the possible loss by Malaysia of its GSP
status was seized upon by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as
a rhetorical weapon against political and labor-union
opponents. Dr. Mahathir and his supporters in the last four
months repeatedly accused their adversaries of threatening
Malaysia's economy by colluding with the U.S. labor groups
that filed the petitions.
   Malaysian labor and political-opposition leaders denied
urging American groups to file the petitions to pressure the
government into granting additional safeguards to workers and
removing constraints on union organizing. But their denials
were lost in a blizzard of critical reports churned out by
the Malaysian media, which are largely controlled by the
government and Dr. Mahathir's United Malays National
Organization.
   "Mahathir turned GSP into an effective campaign issue,"
said a labor analyst, noting that a national election must be
held by October 1991 but is widely expected to take place
sooner. "And it's a tough issue for the labor leaders to
defuse because they have been pushing so hard on such things
as unionizing the electronics industry."
   Malaysia thwarted an earlier petition, filed in 1988 by
the AFL-CIO, the giant U.S. labor federation, to revoke its
GSP benefits. Though the petition was accepted for further
review, the trade representative's office finally ruled in
April 1989 that Malaysia should retain its status, in part
because because the workers' rights that the nation upheld
were approaching international standards.
   But U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, in a letter
that same month to Malaysian Trade and Industry Minister
Rafidah Aziz, expressed concern that Malaysia "does not allow
full freedom for workers to associate and form the labor
organizations of their own choosing in certain export
industries, such as the electronics industry." She also noted
that a government-investment program restricts collective
bargaining issues between workers and foreign-backed
concerns.

   Managers Say 9%
   Isn't Magic Number
   To Go Long Term

   With long-term government bonds now yielding over 9%, is
this the time for individual investors to start buying?
   Not yet, say several investment advisers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Even though government-guaranteed returns of more than 9%
may look tempting, these money managers say shorter-term
investments are a safer bet, at least for the next few weeks.
That is especially true, they say, because of the crisis in
the Middle East.
   "I think interest rates are going higher here and around
the world, so this is a good time to keep money in
short-term, liquid investments," says Jeffrey A. Poxon, chief
investment officer at Lafayette Life Insurance Co. in
Lafayette, Ind. "We've got our helmets and flak jackets on."
   Betting on long-term bonds right now "is very dangerous,"
agrees James M. Benham, chairman of the Benham Capital
Management Group of mutual funds in Mountain View, Calif.
"It's just too big a gamble to buy long bonds right now and
bet that this is the high we'll see in rates."
   Since Iraqi troops stormed into Kuwait, soaring oil prices
have jolted stock and bond markets around the world. In the
U.S., yields on long-term bonds have jumped three-quarters of
a percentage point this month alone. For example, 30-year
Treasury bonds late yesterday yielded about 9.1%, up from
8.35% on Aug. 1, just before the Iraqi invasion. But some
forecasters say even higher yields lie ahead.
   "I think it would be premature to regard bonds as a good
investment right now," says Robert M. Giordano, a partner at
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and the firm's director of economic
research. "They probably are a bad speculation now because
the inflation picture is deteriorating and continued upward
pressure on yields is likely."
   Mr. Giordano sees "a real risk" that bond yields could
jump to the 9 1/2% to 10% area in the next few months. At
those levels, he says, long-term bonds "would probably be a
pretty good investment."
   Some money managers say bonds already represent good
value. They say the economy may already have fallen into a
recession, that higher oil prices will make the slump even
more severe and that investor fears about inflation will
again prove to be exaggerated.
   Thirty-year Treasury bonds now look "very attractive" over
a long-term horizon, says Robert S. Dow, a partner at Lord,
Abbett &amp; Co. and head of its fixed-income division. "I'm not
saying people should leverage themselves to the hilt and go
long, but too many people have too much money sitting in bank
CDs or commercial paper or money-market funds."
   Money managers who are bearish on bonds reply that
safety-conscious individual investors can earn nearly the
same yields, with much less price volatility, on shorter-term
bonds as on long-term issues. For example, Treasury notes due
in two years now yield about 8 1/4%. Five-year notes yield
8.66%, or 0.44 percentage point less than 30-year bonds.
   For institutional investors with large amounts of money to
manage, that gap is significant. But for investors looking
for a safe place to park $10,000, the difference in interest
income works out to only $44.00 a year.
   Bond prices, which move in the opposite direction from
yields, have plummeted over the past few weeks. "It's been a
very rough month, one of the worst ever," says Virginia M.
Henneberry, first vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc.
   Investors who made the mistake of buying long-term
government bonds at the start of the month would already have
seen the resale value of their bonds plunge by about 6%. The
Treasury bond market's slump since Aug. 1 is the most severe
since May 1986, when prices fell 6.53%, Ms. Henneberry says.
The worst month was October 1979, when interest rates soared
and long-term Treasury bond prices nosedived 8.74%.
   Several economists contend investors should wait to buy
long-term bonds until after a recession has clearly begun.
Interest rates, they say, typically continue rising in the
early stages of a recession. One explanation is that
inflation pressures usually don't ease until after a business
slump is well under way, says Mr. Giordano of Goldman Sachs.
   One obvious problem with trying to use the onset of
recession to time bond-market investments is that it is
difficult, if not impossible to know if a recession is indeed
under way. When investors say not to buy bonds until after a
recession begins, "they're always looking back with perfect
20-20 hindsight, knowing exactly when the recession began,"
says Mr. Dow of Lord Abbett.
   Still, other money managers contend that pressures for
higher interest rates abroad probably will continue to
depress U.S. bond prices. Higher rates overseas, they say,
could make dollar-denominated investments look even less
attractive to investors in other countries, at least in
coming weeks.
   `I think rates are poised to go higher in both Germany and
Japan," says Mr. Benham of Benham Capital. "That would widen
the gap between their rates and ours and make it even more
difficult" for U.S. bond prices to recover. However, he says
higher interest rates both here and abroad eventually will
slow world-wide economic growth, paving the way for another
bull market in bonds.
   "Until investors see where, when and how events in the
Middle East unfold," says Mr. Poxon of Lafayette Life, "I'm
afraid interest rates are going to head upward because of the
inflationary impact of the price of oil."

   Lions Bet on Run-and-Shoot

   Pontiac, Mich. -- Enter the offices of the Detroit Lions
football team here and you'll see photo blowups of the Lions
of old, growling in the snow and mud of a Detroit winter.
You'll recall that this gang last tasted serious glory when
the likes of Alex Karras, Joe Schmidt and "Night Train" Lane
prowled its defensive side, and its offense served mainly to
give those beasts a rest.
   Today's Lions are a quite-different breed. They play not
in gritty Motown but in this distant suburb, and beneath a
mudfree, snow-proof, silver-toned dome. The team's defense in
recent years has been perfunctory at best. It's current
selling point is an attack it calls the "Silver Stretch," but
that most others call the "run-and-shoot." By either name,
it's the latest in National Football League slick.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Interestingly, though, the spiffy new suit seems to suit,
and the pride has regained its, uh, pride. "One of our jobs
going into this season will be to guard against
over-optimism," says Wayne Fontes, the Lions' second-year
head coach. "People's expectations for us are pretty high
after last year."
   What the Lions did to get the locals revved up was to win
six of their last seven games. Trouble was, they'd lost eight
of nine by that time, so their final mark was an
undistinguished 7-9. Still, that was better than the 4-12,
4-11 and 5-11 records of the previous three campaigns, and
not bad for a team that has posted just six .500-plus years
since the 1966 NFL-American Football League merger.
   In that same span, Detroit has won but one divisional
title and gained three playoff berths. It's among four teams
that never have advanced as far as the semifinal (conference
championship) round of the league's Super Bowl tournament.
   Into this Slough of Despond stepped Fontes, a former
defensive assistant. Among his first coachly acts was to
recruit Darrel "Mouse" Davis. Davis had been a sort of Johnny
Appleseed of the run-and-shoot, introducing it around this
country and the one up north in his past posts.
   "Defensive players have become so fast and good that a new
offensive philosophy is required," says the
not-especially-mouselike Mouse. "To move the ball
consistently, you need a way to spread 'em out."
   The run-and-shoot does that by deploying four wide
receivers -- mostly short, quick guys -- and no tight end.
Two of them line up on the line of scrimmage, well outside
the tackles. The other two are "slotted" in the backfield,
outside the tackles but inside the wideouts; one often goes
in motion before the ball is snapped. There's also one
running back, who can double as a pass catcher.
   Davis is quick to point out that it's not so much the
formation that makes the R&amp;S work, but what the quarterback
and receivers do. "We have relatively few plays, but each has
lots of options. The receivers have to react to what the
defenders do, and the quarterback has to read their reactions
and make the right throwing choice."
   He asserts: "If we operate it properly, there isn't
anything we can't do. We can pass long or short, or run the
ball. And we can play from behind or ahead."
   In last year's R&amp;S inaugural at Pontiac, the Lions offense
moved up to 18th-best in the league from 28th, or last, the
season before. They ran better than they shot, which Davis
says was partly attributable to foes spreading their defenses
to stop the pass.
   It also was because of rookie Barry Sanders. This stocky,
fast-starter from Oklahoma State, the 1988 Heisman winner,
led the NFC in rushing with a team-record 1,470 yards. "If
you could build a back to run from the Silver Stretch, you'd
build Barry," Davis notes.
   The Lions' primary shootists last season were Rodney Peete
and Bob Gagliano. Peete, out of Southern Cal, was the
higher-touted of the two but suffered various leg injuries,
and it was under Gagliano, a skinny-looking journeyman, that
the team won its last five games. The pair has traded off at
the starting spot in the current preseason, but Peete, now
healed and bulked up, appears to have the edge.
   Detroit expended its top 1990 draft choice for last
season's Heisman winner, Andre Ware, another quarterback.
Ware dazzled 'em commanding the R&amp;S at the U. of Houston, but
while the Lions have given him a number (11), he hasn't given
them the right one yet, and as of yesterday remained unsigned
and not in camp. This is not uncommon for top draft picks in
a league in which players typically make big bucks early or
not at all (Sanders held out until a few days before his
rookie campaign started), but it still pains Davis.
   "Making our offense go requires the quarterback getting
lots of repetitions," he laments. "Andre's missed too many
already."
   Nonetheless, the other players are getting their reps, and
the coaches think that'll help. So, too, they believe, will
be a receiver corps strengthened by the addition of veteran
free agents Aubrey Matthews (ex-Green Bay) and Terry Greer
(San Francisco), and, maybe, rookie Jeff Campbell.
   The Lions defense could use some firming, and Fontes sees
this taking place. Linebacker Chris Spielman, defensive back
Bennie Blades and lineman Jerry Ball, a contract holdout, are
nasty young veterans, and the team spent its Nos. 2, 3 and 4
draft choices to get them help that's similarly disposed.
   And Fontes, who'd been an assistant coach with the team
before getting the top job with five games left in the 1988
schedule, hopes last season's late success, coupled with two
wins in as many exhibition games this month, will lighten the
burden of the Lions unhappy history.
   "We used to go into games wondering how we'd lose, but
after we beat Cleveland last Thanksgiving we discovered
things didn't have to turn out that way," says he. "Maybe
this season the education process won't be so painful."

   Turkish, Greek Airlines' Routes Diverge

   Ankara Helps Its Carrier
   To Soar as Olympic Flounders

   ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Surrounded by glossy mockups for a new
ad campaign, Cem Kozlu, Turkish Airlines' new chairman and
chief executive officer, enthusiastically outlines his goal:
"The key thing is to change the mentality of a monopoly to a
customer-oriented company."
   In Athens, Greece, Loukas Grammatikos, the new
director-general of Olympic Airways, has just returned from
New York and looks tired -- for good reason. The 24-year
veteran of the Greek carrier piloted the Boeing 747 to New
York and back as part of his regular duties.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   His concerns differ substantially from Mr. Kozlu's. The
Greek government hasn't yet agreed to raise the skimpy
capital base of the loss-making airline. Olympic's fleet
renewal program has been messy and long. "If we improve our
service," Mr. Grammatikos says, "if we solve our financial
problems, if we renew the fleet, then I think the company can
survive."
   The two small Mediterranean airlines have their
similarities: Both are state-owned, overstaffed and
undercapitalized and offer indifferent service. State
meddling and labor unrest often undermine management
initiatives. Each is burdened with unprofitable domestic
route networks. Neither has a sterling safety record.
   Yet there are huge differences, too. One is profitable,
the other not; one is free of subsidies, the other dependent
on the state.
   Both, however, say they are doing their best to guarantee
better futures.
   A restructured Turkish Airlines has benefited from seven
years of a free-market government and is on course to cope
with more competitive skies as Europe and the world gradually
deregulate aviation. The government still plans to sell
shares in the profitable carrier on the Istanbul Stock
Exchange this year.
   Olympic, on the other hand, provides a handy freeze-frame
look at what can happen if a government and its state airline
don't change old, unprofitable ways. Trying to do anything at
Olympic, says a government official familiar with the
company, "is like trying to run in water."
   Olympic reflects Athens's less than successful economic
policies. It is heavily subsidized but still loses money,
having piled up 60 billion drachmas ($378 million) of
interest-bearing debt to the state. It can't -- or won't --
pay its fuel bills at home. Several initiatives to
restructure the company in the 1980s came to naught. Mr.
Grammatikos and Olympic's new chairman, Vassilios Filias --
the requisite political appointee, he is a sociology
professor with no airline experience -- appear thus far
unable to steer the wayward monopoly toward efficiency.
   It wasn't always this way at Olympic. In 1957, billionaire
ship-owner Aristotle Onassis took over a small airline the
state had created after the war. He named it Olympic and by
many accounts ran it skillfully. But when fuel prices shot up
in 1974, the state wouldn't allow Mr. Onassis to raise fares
to the 33 domestic airports the airline served. The company
started running heavy losses, and Mr. Onassis sold it back to
the government.
   It has been downhill for Olympic ever since.
   Under state ownership, Olympic became a place where failed
politicians and ministers' nephews found jobs, according to
government officials and former employees. The number of
staff zoomed from 6,000 in the Onassis days to nearly 13,000
(plus 2,000 in the catering operation) today. Olympic has 38
jetliners and last year carried 6.7 million passengers,
two-thirds of them on domestic routes.
   The airline's government-set domestic fares are too low to
be profitable -- 48% below Spain's, the next cheapest in
Europe. Olympic had negative operating results in six of the
past 10 years. Mr. Grammatikos says he expects the carrier's
losses to narrow this year to 10 billion drachmas on revenue
of 160 billion drachmas. But interest expenses are expected
to be 23% of revenue this year, an enormous amount compared
with the European airline average of 2% to 3%.
   In recent talks with the Greek finance minister, Mr.
Grammatikos asked for a 30 billion drachma capital increase,
which would raise Olympic's measly capitalization to 55
billion drachmas. The minister "was favorably indifferent, or
indifferently favorable," said the 54-year-old pilot. "He
didn't say no."
   The government has said it doesn't intend to take the
airline private, a position that pleases its unions. Mr.
Grammatikos thinks that's a shame. "If private capital got
into the company, it would give Olympic more dynamism and
force it to operate as a free-enterprise company in a free
market," he says. A bill pending in the Greek Parliament --
one that is provoking nationwide strikes -- would take
Olympic and other state enterprises out of the public sector.
   Unlike Olympic, Turkish Airlines, or Turk Hava Yollari as
it's known at home, isn't questioning its survival. In
Turkey's past seven years under President Turgut Ozal,
foreign-exchange controls have been dropped, an export boom
and rapid tourism development have ended hard-currency
shortages, and Turkish Airlines is flowering under Ankara's
hands-off attitude and Mr. Kozlu's management.
   The government used to put retired generals at the helm of
the airline, with predictable results. But in 1988, Mr.
Ozal's government decided to expand Turkish Air and make it
more competitive internationally. That was when it pensioned
off the general in charge and brought in Mr. Kozlu.
   The 43-year-old executive says he learned from Stanford
Business School and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. about management by
objective, strategic planning and the case-study approach.
From his doctorate in management from Istanbul's Bosphorus
University and from his stint as managing director of Turkish
trading company Komili Holding AS, he learned about
international trade and competition.
   Turkish Airlines is no longer a monopoly. At least 10 new
charter, scheduled and commuter airlines compete against the
state-owned carrier and the foreign airlines that serve
Turkey. The company was profitable through most of the 1980s
and last year earned $2 million on revenue of $542 million.
Mr. Kozlu expects 1990 profit to reach $15 million.
   In trying to meet its competition, Turkish Air has created
its own charter airline, has moved to improve service in
several areas and is studying ways to trim its staff while
increasing its efficiency.
   To capitalize on Turkey's booming tourist trade, the
carrier teamed up with West Germany's Lufthansa last year to
create a charter airline, Sunexpress, based in Antalya,
Turkey, that flies with leased Boeing Co. 737s to northern
Europe.
   To win the loyalty of Turks traveling abroad, Turkish Air
launched a frequent-flier program, and about 4,000 people
have paid $50 each to sign up.
   The carrier still has a way to go, however. On a recent
flight, an Istanbul-based British businessman remarked that
flight attendants "are smiling and trying to be helpful," but
nevertheless said he flies with the competition whenever
possible.
   After taking over in October 1988, one of Mr. Kozlu's
first goals was to improve on-time performance, in which
Turkish Air then ranked lowest among the 21 members of the
Association of European Airlines. Now, it's the fourth
highest. Next year, he says, he intends to separate the
domestic fleet from the international fleet to further reduce
delays. Of the carrier's 4.2 million passengers last year,
56% flew on domestic routes.
   Mr. Kozlu also has had the planes repainted, given flight
attendants new uniforms and set about redecorating overseas
offices. Employees who speak foreign languages now get extra
pay, and 600 staffers are taking language lessons at company
expense.

SUPREME COURT (SUP)
</GV>
<LP>
   Regarding your July 27 editorial "The Great Non-Litmus," I
agree that the Supreme Court is becoming increasingly
irrelevant with regard to abortion, because of both the
galvanization of the pro-choice forces and the growing
inclination of the justices to let the states resolve the
issue. I also think your optimism that the political system
can now work out the issue may also be correct. That is not
to say, however, that the legislative marketplace would have
reached a satisfactory equilibrium on abortion by now had the
court never involved itself.
   Despite widespread sentiment for some loosening of
abortion restrictions prior to Roe v. Wade, a majority of
state legislators were reluctant to act. It is baffling how
some states could prohibit abortions in the case of rape or
incest despite overwhelming popular sentiment to the
contrary.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Hence, the role of the Supreme Court. The court set
controlling normative values on abortion with which many
people clearly agree. It also may have set norms that are
beyond what the majority would accept. The Roe decision
certainly created a framework that was much broader than
necessary to resolve the case before it. The irrelevancy of
the court with regard to abortion, however, as measured by
the current state political battles, is due mainly to popular
acceptance of much of what the court decided in Roe. If the
court had never interfered with the state legislatures, I
doubt that they would have reached a political solution that
incorporated the existing sentiment for some liberalization
of abortion restrictions.
   Mark D. Robins

   You find Roe v. Wade unconstitutional because "the word
`abortion' does not occur in the Constitution."
   These words do appear: "The enumeration in the
Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to
deny or disparage others retained by the people" (Ninth
Amendment), and "No state shall make or enforce any law which
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws" (14th Amendment).
   Over the years, the court has found that the Ninth
Amendment protects us from government interference in such
matters as personal medical decisions and contraception. It
doesn't take a great legal leap to reason that to restrict
abortion would interfere with the personal medical choices of
a woman in a way that cannot be applied to a man, thus
violating both the Ninth and the 14th amendments. Leaving
abortion to the political process means that women's status
as equal citizens will vary from state to state, from year to
year.
   Andrea Lancer

   Your editorial asserted with derision that if Louisiana
adopted its proposed highly restrictive abortion law, the
worst thing that would happen is that women would have to
cross a state line to obtain an abortion. Was your subsequent
July 30 "Notable &amp; Quotable" excerpt from the Alan Guttmacher
Institute's recent report -- noting that because of a sharp
decrease in the availability of abortion services, many women
must travel long distances to obtain these services,
increasing the likelihood that the abortion will take place
later in pregnancy when the health risks are greater --
intended as counterpoint or atonement?
   Having to travel not only takes time and causes delay, it
also costs money. Traveling long distances also separates the
woman from her family and friends, requires time off from
work, and leaves her without follow-up medical care. Before
you decide that barriers to exercising any kind of right are
inconsequential, check out what those barriers mean to the
individuals who will have to surmount them.

   Unlisted Shares Plunge 14.62 to 360.22;
   Market at Lowest Level Since May 1988

   The over-the-counter stock market ended the day as it
began: falling into sandy uncertainty.
   Yesterday's 14.62 point loss brought the Nasdaq Composite
Index to a level it hadn't seen since May 1988.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One trader suggests the sell-off has become so prolonged
and so pronounced that investors are selling at the closing
bell in anticipation of lower prices at the next day's
opening bell.
   Whatever the reason, traders' frustration at the absence
of supporting price levels or positive developments to rally
the market has become evident.
   "We're in very dangerous territory. Who knows how and
where it's going to stop," says Philip Benizzi, head of OTC
trading for Dillion Read &amp; Co.
   And Leslie Seff, director of OTC trading for Gruntal &amp;
Co., says the best advice for now is to be on the sidelines
while the world squares off against Iraq.
   "I see little change in direction until a positive change
occurs in world affairs," Mr. Seff says.
   While the Nasdaq Composite Index was dropping 3.9% to
360.22, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was falling 3% to
2483.42, its first close below 2500 since July 1989. The New
York Stock Exchange Composite Index lost 3.1%.
   The OTC market started the day 2% lower at the opening and
3.5% lower an hour later. By midday, unlisted stocks were
recovering, only to retreat quickly in the final 30 minutes.
   This war-wary market seems to have abandoned old
priorities, says Barry Berman, head of equity trading for
Robert W. Baird &amp; Co.
   "Economic news, technical support levels just haven't made
any difference," Mr. Berman says.
   The OTC's fifth straight loss was a broad one. Only 320
issues advanced on the day while 2,163 declined.
   Volume jumped to 202.8 million shares from Wednesday's
146.1 million shares.
   On the brighter side of a bleak OTC market, Dillon Read's
Mr. Benizzi reports some of the added volume yesterday was
institutions selectively returning to the buy side of the
market.
   Mr. Benizzi says corporations buying back their own issues
and other institutions shopping for a particular bargain
helped bring up some prices.
   Intel benefitted from buy-back news and bargain hunting.
   Twenty points below its 52-week high, Intel announced its
intent to repurchase up to 20 million of its 204 million
common shares. Intel shares got a 1 1/8 point boost to 33
1/4. Its volume of 4.5 million shares topped the OTC
most-active list.
   Shorewood Packaging was 3 1/4 lower to 7 3/4 after
predicting late Wednesday that its first quarter earnings
would be about 30% below the 30 cents a share it earned in
the quarter a year ago. More than 2.6 million Shorewood
shares changed hands, nearly 12 times its daily average
volume.
   Among active stocks: MCI Communications was down 1 1/4 at
31 3/4; Oracle Systems fell 5/8 to 12 3/4; Apple Computer
lost 5/8 to 34 1/3; Nike closed 2 lower at 60; and Amgen was
1 3/8 lower at 41 3/8.
   McCaw Cellular Communications' debt problems were
highlighted in yesterday's "Heard on the Street Column" in
this newspaper. The column reported McCaw's $4 billion of
debt has inspired a strong bearish sentiment about its stock.
McCaw shares lost 2 to 15 3/4.
   Elmwood Federal Savings Bank regained some lost ground,
adding 1 to 7 1/2. Elmwood lost half of its value Wednesday
when Susquehanna Bancshares terminated its agreement to
purchase Elmwood. Susquehanna shares fell 3/4 yesterday to
close at 17.
   Flagship Financial estimated it would charge $13 million
against earnings in the third quarter for costs associated
with the closing of five First American Savings retail units
in New Jersey. Flagship Financial shares dropped 1 1/2 to 7
1/2.

   PHILADELPHIA -- SmithKline Beecham PLC said it agreed to
manufacture a generic form of its blood-pressure drug Dyazide
for distribution by Rugby Laboratories in the U.S.
   SmithKline said capsules of the product would be shipped
by Rugby to wholesalers and pharmacies by Oct. 1. The company
said it also would continue to provide Dyazide for patients,
doctors and pharmacists "who prefer brand-name products."

   A SmithKline spokeswoman said she didn't know details
about pricing plans for the generic version of the drug. She
indicated that the chemical formulation of the generic
version would be identical to that of the brand-name product.
   Dyazide, a longtime mainstay of SmithKline's drug line,
was introduced in the U.S. in 1965. But U.S. sales plunged
53%, to $153 million in 1988, the first full year after the
Food and Drug Administration approved the initial generic
form of the product. Moreover, the arrival of generic
competition stunned the company, even though its patent on
the drug had expired seven years earlier.
   Frederick Kyle, president of SmithKline's U.S.
pharmaceuticals unit, said the alliance with Rugby would give
his company "an excellent opportunity" to compete against
more generic rivals to Dyazide that are expected to enter the
market.
   In February, SmithKline cut the Dyazide price to
wholesalers by 11%.
   The price-cutting action came in the wake of an admission
by Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. that its employees filled
Vitarine capsules with SmithKline's Dyazide to win FDA
approval of a generic version of the medicine. Meanwhile,
Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., another generic competitor,
withdrew from the blood-pressure medicine market following
allegations that data used to obtain FDA approval for
marketing Bolar's product had been falsified.

   Exchange Seat Prices

   NEW YORK -- Stock exchange membership prices are falling
along with the price of stocks.
   A seat on the New York Stock Exchange changed hands
yesterday at $301,000, the lowest sale price since Dec. 17,
1984. The last sale at a price below $300,000 took place a
few days earlier in 1984.

   On Monday, an American Stock Exchange seat sold for
$107,500, the lowest price since January 1980.
   "I would anticipate that if the market continues to
decline, seat prices will decline with it," says Perrin Long,
securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical.
   He says it's hard to predict how low seat prices will
fall, as prices will to some degree be tied to market
performance. He says that if the Dow Jones Industrial Average
falls to the 2000 level, NYSE seat prices could fall to the
$200,000 to $225,000 range. The average, which reached a
record high of 2999.75 in mid-July, closed below 2500
yesterday.
   Charles Vincent, a vice president and securities analyst
at Provident National Bank, says falling stock prices usually
mean lower trading volume and lower revenue for securities
firms, which cut the value of exchange memberships.
   But the drop in exchange seat prices is a trend that long
predates the recent stock plunge tied to Mideast tensions.
Analysts cite the drop-off in equity trading volume from the
high levels of 1986 and early 1987 as one big reason, and Mr.
Long says the increased role of electronic equities trading
also has contributed to the decline in the value of exchange
seats.
   NYSE seat prices peaked Sept. 21, 1987, at $1,150,000.
That sale was one of seven made in 1987 for $1 million or
more. After the October 1987 world-wide stock market crash,
seat prices declined. The last sale of 1987 was made on Dec.
29 for $625,000.

   NEW YORK -- Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s former mergers
chief, Leon Black, is part of a group that bought 3,750,000
shares of Class A stock in Fruit of the Loom Inc. from Farley
Inc.
   Mr. Black's role was disclosed in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing by FL Management, an investment
advisory firm headed by Mr. Black and three other former
Drexel employees, John Hannan, Arthur Bilger and Craig Cogut.
The group's holding amounts to 7% of Fruit of the Loom's
stock.

   The Black group is investing money on behalf of several
French institutions, which put up the cash to buy the Fruit
of the Loom stock, Mr. Hannan said in an interview. The
French institutions formally made their investment as Land
Free Investment Ltd.
   Farley previously entered into a put option agreement that
gives Land Free Investment the right to require Farley to
purchase its Fruit of the Loom stock, under certain
conditions, at an exercise price of $15.54 between July 12
and July 15, 1991.
   The filing said the purchases were made for investment
reasons, and Mr. Hannan said the group didn't have any
present intention to increase its holdings. Mr. Black, while
at Drexel, was a regular adviser to Farley Inc.'s chairman,
William Farley.
   The filing also disclosed that Messrs. Bilger, Black and
Cogut have an indirect interest in 3,660,000 Class A Fruit of
the Loom shares which were previously acquired through
partnerships that are partners in Champlain Associates. In
addition, Messrs. Black and Cogut have an indirect interest
in 141,153 shares of Class A stock owned by Wicklow
Investment Associates, in which Mr. Cogut is a general
partner.
   Mr. Black also directly owns 124,000 Class A shares and
Mr. Cogut owns 34,264 Class A shares.
