   Unpaid Taxes to Reach $100 Billion

   WASHINGTON -- Americans will fail to pay at least $100
billion of the federal income taxes they owe this year,
according to Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Fred T.
Goldberg Jr.
   The largest chunk of unpaid revenue is owed by sole
proprietors such as lawyers, doctors and restaurateurs,
according to General Accounting Office officials who
testified with Mr. Goldberg before the House Ways and Means
oversight subcommittee.

<TEXT>
   If all the money due were collected, it would largely
erase the federal budget deficit. But the government isn't
likely to collect more than a quarter of it unless the
Internal Revenue Service strengthens its enforcement
programs, Mr. Goldberg said.
   According to an IRS report released at the hearing, the
so-called tax gap -- the difference between taxes owed and
taxes actually paid -- was between $82.5 billion and $94.2
billion in 1987, the most recent year complete tax data are
available. Mr. Goldberg projected that it could reach $110.1
billion to $127 billion in 1992.
   And that's only counting the federal income tax on legal
income. Mr. Goldberg said the agency is working on estimates
of unpaid taxes from illegal transactions, such as drug
dealing. Private calculations put the tax gap over $200
billion if illegal income and unpaid state taxes and other
taxes are included.
   It is impossible to wipe out the tax gap entirely, and Mr.
Goldberg indicated that the IRS has little interest in
aggressively pursuing babysitters and other "folks scrapping
to get by." But he did identify four business sectors where
noncompliance is particularly acute, and he vowed to toughen
IRS efforts to bring in the money owed.
   Sole proprietors underpaid their federal income tax
liabilities by about 23% in 1987, accounting for about $16.6
billion, or 20%, of the tax gap for the year, according to
the GAO, which analyzed the IRS data. Those underpayments
reflected both unreported income and excessive deductions,
the IRS said. Mr. Goldberg said the IRS has begun an auditing
program to examine taxpayers in this category with over
$100,000 in gross receipts.
   Large corporations -- defined by the IRS as those with
more than $10 million in assets -- underpaid about $15.8
billion in 1987, 19% of the tax gap. Banks and petroleum
companies were the biggest offenders, the GAO said. The IRS
said improper accounting, whether deliberate or not, caused
much of the underpayments.
   Informal suppliers -- proprietors who often deal in cash
and usually have no regular hours or place of business --
underpaid about $7.7 billion, or about 9% of the tax gap in
1987, the GAO figured. Frequent culprits were roadside food
vendors and people hired to make home repairs or provide
child care.
   And small corporations underpaid federal income taxes by
about $5.2 billion, accounting for about 6% of the tax gap in
1987. Only half the businesses with $50,000 or less in assets
fully complied with the tax law, the government estimated.
The compliance rate for businesses with assets between $5
million and $10 million was far higher, 90%.
   The IRS estimates the tax gap primarily using information
from audits. The agency cautioned that the precise amount of
unpaid taxes is extremely difficult to determine.
   While Mr. Goldberg said the extent of uncollected revenues
"is certainly a cause for concern," he stressed that taxpayer
compliance hasn't slipped. Rather, he said, the tax gap has
grown along with overall revenues.
   Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the IRS has failed to
reduce the tax gap partly because audit rates have plummeted
over the past decade. In 1978, for example, the IRS audited
7.42% of small corporations; in 1989, it audited only 1.61%.
In 1978, 47.82% of large corporations were audited; by 1989
the rate had fallen to 25.52%.
   "It will take many years to restore audit coverage to
appropriate levels," Mr. Goldberg said. "It's high time we
start."
   Criminal prosecutions of tax cheaters also have declined
as the IRS has focused more of its resources on bringing
legal action against drug dealers and organized crime,
officials said.
   Mr. Goldberg said that modernizing the agency's outdated
computer system and better educating taxpayers on the laws
also will bring about increased compliance.
   The subcommittee urged the agency to do better. "I think a
country who is up to its neck in debt and deficits ought to
think about how we get the money from the deadbeats before we
raise taxes on those who do pay," said Rep. Byron Dorgan (D.,
N.D.).

   Japanese shipbuilders signed contracts to build 208 ships
with a total gross tonnage of eight million metric tons in
the fiscal year ended March 31, an increase of 43% from 5.62
million metric tons a year earlier.
   The Japan Shipbuilders' Association attributes the strong
performance to bullish sentiment toward the world economic
situation and fears by customers that shipbuilders might not
have the capacity to meet increased demand for certain types
of vessels.
   Citing the case of Very Large Crude Carriers, the
association asserts 300 VLCCs must be replaced in coming
years, but that world shipyards can only build 10 annually.
   The Japan Shipbuilders' Association also notes that
environmentalist pressure in the U.S. for legislation
requiring tankers to be double-hulled could lead to
additional new orders for VLCCs.
                                                                                                       

   ENTERPRISE IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA
                                                                                                       

   Czechoslovakia's parliament has approved long-awaited laws
permitting private enterprise and the establishment of joint
stock companies. The private-enterprise law stipulates that
anyone can establish a business without seeking official
permission. There are no limits on the number of employees or
capital involved in a firm, and private business is allowed
in all spheres. The new measures permit the issuing of shares
to individuals, groups and companies, and allow the
"reasonable" participation of foreign capital in the
Czechoslovak economy.
                                                                                                       

   BURMESE ELECTIONS
                                                                                                       

   Western diplomats expect Burma's May 27 elections -- the
country's first multi-party polls in 29 years -- to be an
army-rigged farce. And Burmese military ruler General Saw
Maung has done little to change this pessimistic assessment.
In a Wednesday speech at the Defense Ministry in Rangoon, he
defended the stringent rules his government has imposed on
campaigning and access by opposition parties to
statecontrolled radio and television. "We cannot allow a
party to do something freely if it affects the freedom of the
public," he said.
                                                                                                       

   SINGAPORE RENTS
                                                                                                       

   The cost of renting office space in Singapore has risen
79% since December 1988, according to data compiled by
property consultants. Office rent is expected to rise by 20%
to 30% in 1990 as available space continues to shrink. New
office space, which has been built at an average yearly rate
of 1.2 million square feet in recent years, fell to 530,000
square feet in 1988 and 213,000 square feet last year.
                                                                                                       

   CELEBRATING PLASTIC
                                                                                                       

   Plastic, the miracle material hailed as one of the most
important inventions since the wheel, has become the subject
of a major museum exhibit. London's Victoria and Albert
Museum has turned over a whole section to synthetics, ranging
from computer keyboards to imitation fruit. While museum
officials have tried to exalt the scientific importance of
plastic, most visitors appear drawn to nostalgic items, such
as cups and plates in ice cream colors, cheap vinyl
furniture, ornate sunglasses, and blond Barbie dolls.
                                                                                                       

   EUROPEAN TAXES
                                                                                                       

   The European Community Commission unveiled a two-stage
plan aimed at getting EC member states to narrow differences
in corporate-tax rates.
   The first step would be the adoption by governments of tax
legislation to encourage companies to do business across
national borders, as part of the EC's plan for a single
market by the end of 1992. The second would be to explore how
the EC can reconcile differences in national tax systems with
the smooth functioning of the unified market.
   The EC tax commissioner, Christiane Scrivener, said the
commission dropped a 1975 plan to put corporate taxes in a
band of 45% to 55%. Instead of standardization, she said, it
wants to follow a more pragmatic policy of coordination. "Our
aim must be to let companies take full advantage of the
single market," she said.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   According to the Albanian state news agency, Albania's
Communist Party chief Ramiz Alia has outlined economic
reforms, including some private farming, designed to increase
production and improve supply. But he rejected the sweeping
liberalism that has ended Communist rule in most of Eastern
Europe. . . . Some Taiwan doctors are warning trendy young
people against alleged health hazards of the "lambada."
According to Taipei's United Daily News, the physicians claim
the dance's sinuous Brazilian rhythms and close body contact
could cause "excessive blood flow," rendering partners
"dysfunctional."

   Digital Equipment Corp. said its third-quarter profit fell
90%, after a $150 million charge, but Wall Street was so
relieved the results weren't worse that the stock advanced in
heavy trading.
   Digital also reported slim but better-than-expected
revenue growth, including the first rise in domestic sales in
four quarters, suggesting that the long U.S.
computer-industry slump may be easing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earlier, International Business Machines Corp., NCR Corp.
and Tandem Computers Inc. reported modest improvements in
U.S. revenue. Unisys Corp. said yesterday that domestic sales
were still slow, but analysts said the company's problems may
be more of its own making.
   "This might just be the beginning of a turnaround, with
some of the largest companies seeing signs of improvement in
U.S. sales," suggested Jay P. Stevens, an analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Digital had earlier set expectations so low that anything
short of a loss, which the company said was possible earlier
in the quarter, would have been welcomed. "The bottom line is
that the worst didn't happen, and that's as good as it gets
in the technology sector right now," said Steve Milunovich of
First Boston Corp.
   Digital, the second-largest computer maker after IBM,
posted net income of $24.9 million, or 20 cents a share,
after a charge of $150 million, or $1.20 a share, related to
work-force reduction costs. In the year-earlier period, net
was $256.4 million, or $2.05 a share.
   Revenue rose 4.3% for the fiscal third quarter ended March
31 to $3.26 billion from $3.13 billion.
   Investors applauded the results. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, Digital shares closed
at $82.125, up $2.125. It was among the most-actively traded
stocks, with almost 1.9 million shares changing hands.
   In a statement, the Maynard, Mass.-based company warned
that additional work-force related charges were likely.
"Further opportunities for cost savings are being
investigated, and there may be additional restructuring
charges in the future," said James F. Osterhoff, vice
president and chief financial officer. Without the charge,
Digital would have reported operating profit of perhaps $1 or
$1.10 a share, after accounting for added taxes, analysts
estimated.
   The $150 million third-quarter charge was the first
restructuring charge in Digital's history. Analysts are
forecasting a charge in the fourth quarter of the same size
or greater, as Digital continues to cut its payroll through a
voluntary separation-incentive program.
   Digital disclosed that 700 people have left the company so
far under the program, and an additional 350 are expected to
leave in cutbacks at two plants in Puerto Rico. Digital said
its plans are still "evolving." Sources have indicated that
as many as 8,000 workers will be offered severance packages,
and analysts expect a cut of more than 5,000 jobs from the
work force of 125,800. But the program is progressing more
slowly than expected.
   Digital said international sales remained strong,
especially in Germany, Italy and Japan, and sales improved
somewhat in the United Kingdom. In the U.S., government sales
were weak, while the financial and manufacturing sectors
showed renewed strength, a spokesman said.
   Still, executives signaled continuing concern for the
fourth quarter, and analysts said the company isn't out of
the woods yet.
   "International growth slowed, measured in local
currencies, for the third quarter in a row," said Barry F.
Willman of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. And he said some of the
strength in the third quarter "may have come at the expense
of fourth-quarter sales" because the company was so concerned
about the prospect of a loss.
   For the nine months, net income fell 56% to $331.1
million, or $2.65 a share, compared with $759.4 million, or
$5.94 a share, a year earlier. Revenue advanced 3.6% to $9.58
billion from $9.25 billion.

   WASHINGTON -- Chrysler Corp. said it expects to report
"overall a modest profit" for the first quarter of 1990.
   The projection came in an amended registration statement
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
connection with a proposed offering of $800 million principal
amount of trust certificates due 2020.

   Most industry analysts have been forecasting Chrysler
would break even for the quarter ended March 31. Earlier this
year, company officials hinted that the No. 3 U.S. auto maker
might do somewhat better than that.
   Chrysler closed yesterday at $16.375, down 37.5 cents, in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
   In the filing, Chrysler said it continued to be affected
in the first quarter "by the adverse operating environment
that existed during the second half of 1989, as the costs of
sales incentive programs continued to affect operating
results adversely. . . ."
   Offsetting this were the earnings from its Chrysler
Financial Corp. subsidiary "and, to some extent, {savings
from} Chrysler's previously announced cost-reduction
efforts." The company has pledged to cut its overhead by $1.5
billion by year end.
   In the first quarter of 1989, Chrysler reported earnings
from continuing operations of $338 million, or $1.44 a share,
on revenue of $9.95 billion. Chrysler didn't provide an
estimate in the SEC filing for revenue in the just-ended
first quarter.
   Chrysler did note that its world-wide factory car and
truck sales during the first quarter were 493,612 units
compared with 530,799 units in the fourth quarter of 1989 and
671,560 units in the first quarter of 1989.
   Chrysler estimated that its total share of the U.S. and
Canadian car and truck markets in the first quarter fell to
13.1% from 14.1% in the fourth quarter of 1989 and 14% for
the first quarter of 1989.

   Employers and Unions Feeling Pressure
   To Eliminate Two-Tier Labor Contracts

   Two-tier pay scales, the rage of corporate cost-cutters in
the 1980s, are being pummeled at the bargaining table these
days.
   In more than 650 labor contracts negotiated between 1984
and 1989, new hires wound up on lower pay scales than their
senior co-workers in a variety of industries, including
retail food chains, airlines, metal fabrication and lumber.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Now, a growing population of restive lower-tier workers
are putting the heat on companies and unions alike to
eliminate separate wage scales. "We like to describe it as
mortgaging the unborn," grumbles Chris Manno, a second-tier
pilot at American Airlines of Dallas, where a two-tier system
accepted by its unions in 1983 resulted in new hires getting
up to 50% less than employees already on the payroll.
   With many industries facing a shrinking labor pool,
second-tier voices are being heard. Already, the gap between
tiers has shrunk in some existing dual-pay plans, such as
American's; in a few cases, the whole structure has been
scuttled.
   Meanwhile, despite some notable exceptions -- Lockheed
Corp. machinists and Northwest Airlines pilots recently
agreed to two-tier contracts -- both labor and management are
shying away from new ones. With hundreds still in effect,
such pacts aren't in immediate danger of extinction. But,
according to the Bureau of National Affairs, a private
research firm, only 6% of the 962 non-construction contracts
negotiated in 1989 contained two-tier plans, down from a peak
of 11% in 1985.
   "They're always going to be around, but I think they're
going to be fairly rare in 10 years," says Wayne State
University economist James E. Martin, author of a recent
study on the subject.
   Two-tier contracts spread during the recession-ridden
early 1980s, as companies scrambling to keep up with
deregulation and growing nonunion and foreign competition
pressed their workers for concessions. Union members acceded
in many cases, opting to secure their own jobs and wage
levels instead of accepting across-the-board cuts.
   In many early contracts, second-tier workers could never
earn as much as their senior co-workers because the two
scales never merged. Many new hires also got less insurance
coverage, vacation time and pension benefits.
   American Airlines spokesman John Hotard says the two-tier
system was "the growth plan that kept us alive" during the
early 1980s, when American found itself besieged by
lower-priced competition such as People Express. American
thought it could cut labor costs significantly as attrition
and growth increased the percentage of B-scalers on the
payroll. Under the two-tiered system, American has grown
sharply, from 39,000 workers in 1983 to almost 80,000 today.
   But the hiring of lower-tier workers has proved to be a
double-edged sword. As the economy recovered in recent years,
many companies poured their savings from lower wages into
expansion, hiring more lower-paid workers. That, in turn,
meant a flood of new members and added clout for many unions.
But the new members were often second-tier workers who, as
their numbers grew, became more vocal in opposing the
two-tier system.
   Consider the United Food and Commercial Workers Union,
whose locals probably agreed to more two-tier contracts than
any other union. These days, the union is pushing employers
to merge the scales. The main reason, says Bill Olwell, UFCW
executive vice president for collective bargaining, is
pressure from second-tier members: "They're becoming closer
to a majority and we're a political organization, so we're
responding to them."
   Last year, UFCW members' demands for equal pay triggered
an 81-day strike against unionized food chains in Seattle.
The result was a 27% raise for lower-tier employees, compared
with about 9% for more senior workers. Eight of the 19
two-tier agreements renegotiated by the UFCW in 1989 resulted
in higher pay increases for second-tier workers than the
first-tier.
   Among the 17,000 American Airlines employees represented
by the Association of Professional Flight Attendants,
"B-tier" attendants have begun wearing "Killer B" pins under
their lapels. During a recent union election, one slate of
candidates was defeated, in part because pamphlets were
circulated outlining their involvement in negotiating
American's initial two-tier contract.
   Not all unions have been split by the two-tier
arrangements. In 1988, senior flight attendants at Alaska
Airlines agreed to a two-year pay freeze so that their
lower-tier employees could get a 10% raise. Elsewhere, senior
employees have agreed to accept lump-sum payments in lieu of
the raises given to lower-tier employees.
   Johnny Rodriguez, president of a UFCW local representing
580 Dallas meatcutters, says senior employees have discovered
that lower wages for new hires make it more difficult for all
employees to get raises. "They realized that without a strong
foundation, the house can collapse," he says.
   But even with the two-tier system under fire, a few
companies still resort to it. Lockheed did so this year
because it needed to attract more highly skilled workers
while cutting wages for lower level jobs to meet spending
guidelines on government contracts. "I really don't care for
a two-tier wage system because it creates too many personnel
problems," says Louis J. Barnard, Lockheed's vice president
for human resources. "But the alternative is to cut people's
pay, and nobody likes that."
   In many cases, companies have begun merging their pay
tiers and granting lower-tier workers larger pay increases
just to attract workers amid a shrinking labor pool. "Union
wages have been held down so much that there is sometimes no
advantage to having a B-tier because you can't hire new
workers cheaper anyway," says Peter Cappelli, a management
professor at the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania.
   Giant Food Inc., a Washington area grocery chain,
gradually decreased the pay differential between the two
tiers from $3 an hour in the early 1980s to about $1.50 now.
"The work force in the Washington metro area has just been
shrinking in the last half-dozen years," says Eric Weiss,
Giant's director of labor relations. "By increasing the rate,
we increased the labor pool we have to select from."
   Some experts contend that labor shortages and union
discontent are less responsible for the decline of two-tier
contracts than the overall improvement of the economy since
the early 1980s. "You don't have as many companies that are
under the gun in terms of reducing their labor costs," says
Mark A. de Bernardo, director of labor law for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. If the country slips into another
recession, he says: "you're going to see them more prevalent
again."
   Union leaders say they'll fight any such resurrection, but
many admit that they're not sure how their current members
would handle the decision that thousands of workers faced a
decade ago. "It was a shrewd move by management," laments
Gordon Brehm, an executive with the United Paperworkers
International Union. "It's human nature for people to say,
`Well, it's not going to hurt me and the people who come
tomorrow can look after themselves.'"

   GPU Signs Accord
   To Buy Electricity
   From DQE Inc.

   General Public Utilities Corp. said it signed a 20-year
agreement to buy 500 megawatts of electricity from DQE Inc.,
parent of Duquesne Light Co., in a deal reflecting the
pressing need for additional power in the Northeast.
   The transaction, valued at more than $630 million, calls
for Parsippany, N.J.-based GPU to acquire a 50% interest in a
now-mothballed DQE power plant for $150 million. It further
calls for the utilities to spend $480 million on a
500-kilovolt transmission line that will carry the power from
Pittsburgh-based DQE generating facilities in western
Pennsylvania to GPU customers in eastern Pennsylvania and New
Jersey.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The first power will be sold in 1994, the utilities said,
with the new line scheduled for completion in 1996. GPU said
it will pay five cents a kilowatt hour for the power in the
first year of the agreement, with the rate rising thereafter.
DQE said revenue derived from the agreement will be shared
with its customers. In the first year alone, DQE could
receive about $185 million in revenue, analysts estimated.
   DQE further said it will have the right to use the 50% of
the new transmission line's capacity that isn't utilized
under the GPU arrangement to sell power to other utilities.
DQE Chairman Wesley W. von Schack said he expects "additional
business opportunities" in the Northeast by the mid-1990s,
when, he said, the need for power will be great, while at the
same time new "clean-coal" technology should put DQE's
generating facilities in big demand.
   GPU Chairman and President Standley H. Hoch said that
although the DQE power won't help GPU meet its capacity needs
for several years, he expects that other deals GPU has signed
with so-called independent power producers should enable the
utility to avoid brownouts and blackouts.
   The deal generally represents a new way of doing business
in the electric-utility industry. Before, when a utility
built a new plant or transmission line, that asset would go
into a pool that could be shared by all utilities in that
region, which in this case is Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
Maryland.
   "This deal certainly helps GPU, but it won't help all the
other power-tight utilities in the region," said Daniel
Scotto, utilitybond analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp.

   Weighing Steps
   To Raise Capital

   TOKYO -- Despite the pall over the Tokyo stock market,
there is no pressing need for Japanese banks to reduce assets
to meet international capital-adequacy requirements, a
Finance Ministry official said.
   "I don't see much need for banks to sell their assets,"
the regulator, a senior official in the ministry's banking
bureau, said in an interview. Banks "haven't seriously
thought about selling," he said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   However, if the stock market remains depressed for an
extended period, then "there may be problems . . . in one or
two years," the official said.
   In addition, the banks may be more likely to preserve
domestic assets than those overseas.
   Starting in 1992, the Bank for International Settlements
will require banks in member countries, which include Japan,
to maintain capital equal to 8% of their assets. By March 31,
1991, Japanese banks must be maintaining capital equal to
7.25% of assets.
   While the local stock market was booming, Japanese banks
were counting heavily on issuing shares and equity-linked
debt to finance their necessary increase in capital. With the
Nikkei stock average down 27% since hitting its high at the
end of last year, though, the well of easy cash has dried up.
   There is growing speculation that, as capital grows
tighter, banks now will have to curtail lending and sell
securities and other assets to meet BIS requirements.
However, the Finance Ministry official said that the flow of
capital into banks should be sufficient to allow them to
maintain their current portfolios.
   Likewise, an official of Moody's Investor Service Inc.
here said he believes that capital pressures on Japanese
banks aren't urgent. "I still think that there is an ability
to sell equity here," said Roger B. Arner, executive vice
president of Moody's in Japan.
   Mr. Arner said that "over the near-term, there is no great
concern." Instead, shrinking earnings and market share will
be much bigger problems for Japanese banks, he said. Moody's,
however, is confident about the prospects for Japanese banks
in general, despite these concerns.
   According to the Japanese Finance Ministry official,
capital gains and new financing avenues likely to be approved
by the ministry will help Japanese banks meet BIS
requirements.
   However, there may be a twist that won't be comforting to
overseas securities markets. Most of the gains for Japanese
banks probably lie abroad, according to analysts.
   With the recent sharp decline in the prices of such widely
held domestic assets as stocks and Japanese government bonds,
Japanese banks have been looking to get capital gains from
European equities, some European debt issues, and
dollar-denominated assets such as U.S. Treasury securities,
analysts said.
   Since the turmoil in the Japanese financial markets
started upsetting balance sheets at the start of the year,
Japanese banks have been taking profits on their holdings of
Treasury securities, according to market participants. And
the dollar's appreciation has swelled the profits in terms of
yen. The dollar has risen from 143.40 yen at the end of last
year to 159.45 yen currently, or 11%.
   Help for Japanese banks is also on the horizon from
Japanese regulators, the Finance Ministry official said. In
the near future, "the ministry is likely to approve
subordinated loans to banks" and banks are likely sometime
after that to be allowed to issue subordinated debentures, he
said.

   13% Drop in Profit
   For Its 3rd Quarter

   NEW YORK -- Even Wall Street's most tightfisted securities
firms can't completely shake off the sluggish markets these
days.
   Bear Stearns Cos., renowned for keeping a close eye on
costs, posted a 13% drop in net income for the fiscal third
quarter ended March 30.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Net fell to $34.7 million, or 34 cents a share, from $41.1
million, or an adjusted 39 cents a share, a year earlier.
Per-share results are adjusted for a 5% stock dividend
declared yesterday, to be distributed May 31 along with the
regular quarterly cash payout of 14 cents a share.
   The brokerage and investment-banking firm had quarterly
declines of 19% in investment-banking revenue and 15% in
commission revenue compared with the year-earlier quarter.
The weakness in these areas more than offset strong
performances in mortgage-backed securities and corporate
bonds.
   James Hanbury, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.,
said, "It's a typical Bear Stearns quarter -- they're making
respectable money in tough times."
   Bear Stearns's performance falls in the middle of the pack
of earnings reported by Wall Street securities firms. A few
firms, including Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and PaineWebber Group
Inc., have managed modest profit gains compared with weak
year-earlier quarters; Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.
posted the biggest quarterly loss ever for a securities firm.
   Bear Stearns's results would have been more depressed if
it hadn't kept a tight lid on costs. The firm has been able
to keep nonpayroll expenses steady for several quarters. As a
result, says Diana Keat of Lipper Analytical Securities
Corp., "In good times, this is a firm that can really take
off."
   Revenue for the quarter fell 6%, to $587.6 million, from
$623.6 million.
   For the nine months, net income plunged 31% to $85.8
million, or 82 cents a share, from $124.8 million, or $1.16 a
share, for the year-earlier period. Revenue for the nine
months was about flat, at $1.7 billion.
   Slowing takeover activity has crimped one of Bear
Stearns's bread-and-butter businesses: risk arbitrage, or the
trading of takeover stocks. Alan C. Greenberg, chairman and
chief executive officer, acknowledged the problems in the
risk-arbitrage business but said: "If you're agile enough,
you'll still do all right with it."

   WASHINGTON -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission
announced the recall of more than 600,000 beanbag cushions
linked to the suffocation deaths of 19 babies.
   J.C. Penney Co. of Dallas, as well as several of the
products' manufacturers, voluntarily recalled the pillows,
which are used to support resting or sleeping infants. The
major manufacturers involved in the recall are Hollander Home
Fashions, Newark, N.J., which made 467,000 cushions; and Gold
Inc. of Denver, which made 110,000 pillows. Seven small
companies also are participating in the recall.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   CPSC officials said the agency may take legal action
against one manufacturer who hasn't agreed to a recall, but
officials didn't identify the company. J.C. Penney and the
Army Air Force Exchange Service, which supplies military
bases, sold the Gold Inc. product.
   Commission officials said the 19 infants, three months of
age or younger, died after being left to sleep face down on
the cushions. Ten of the deaths occurred last year. The
fabric-covered pillows, which are filled with polystyrene
pellets, can conform to a baby's face. Suffocation occurs
because newborn infants can't roll over. Early last month,
the CPSC issued an urgent warning about the suffocation risk
associated with the product. By mid-March, all manufacturers
of the cushions had stopped production, the CPSC said.
   Hollander's product was sold under the brand name Mothers
Helper, and the Gold Inc. cushion was known as the Gold Bug
Support Sack. J.C. Penney sold 4,700 of the Gold Inc.
cushions under the names Disney Babies Toddletime Support
Sack, Sleepy Time Bears Support Sack and Sesame Street
Support Sack.

   Philippines Hurt

   MANILA -- An electricity crisis and persistent rumors of a
new coup attempt are frightening off foreign investors,
threatening the economic recovery that began under President
Corazon Aquino.
   At the same time, inflation has reached double digits.
Officials are warning that failure to meet government
spending targets will weaken the Philippine peso and drive up
interest rates, further threatening capital investment.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Since taking power in 1986, President Aquino has pointed
with pride to the revival of the Philippine economy, which
has grown 5% to 6% anually the past two years.
   But failure to invest in new generating equipment, along
with a drought on Luzon island, has brought about a critical
electricity shortage. The government has announced a power
rationing program affecting more than 300 public and private
companies.
   The energy crisis has already begun to take its toll by
discouraging foreign investors. Philip Chien, president of
the Taiwan Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the
Philippines, told the Business Star newspaper that most
Taiwanese investors here have decided to relocate. Taiwan had
been the fastest-growing source of foreign investment here
the past three years.
   Mr. Chien said some Taiwanese were willing to wait a few
months to see if the electricity crisis would ease, but he
added: "We don't think it will stabilize."
   He said government plans to purchase gas turbines to
increase generating capacity would probably drive up
electricity rates too high.
   Meanwhile, Manila is awash in rumors that military
dissidents, responsible for a failed coup in December, are
preparing for a new bid to topple Mrs. Aquino.
   Despite the arrests of several key figures in the December
coup attempt, most of the suspected core group of planners
remain at large.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos warned that public
discontent over rising prices and the power crisis might
encourage another coup attempt.
   The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, has advised
Americans not to travel to eight areas in the Philippines
because of continued problems of crime and insurgency. At
least eight Americans have been killed in communist
insurgency-related incidents in the country in the past four
years.

   Schering-Plough Corp. reported a 20% rise in first-quarter
earnings while another health-care company, Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co., posted a 19% increase.
   Schering-Plough, bolstered by its world-wide
pharmaceutical business, said net income rose to $150.4
million, or $1.33 a share, from $125.7 million, or $1.12 a
share. Sales rose to $865.1 million from $831.8 million, a 4%
increase; without currency fluctuations, sales would have
increased 8%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Pharmaceutical business sales rose 14% excluding currency
fluctuations and last year's sale of a majority interest in a
Brazilian affiliate. Strong results from U.S. prescription
products and the international pharmaceutical business were
partially offset by lower sales of the Wesley-Jessen vision
care business.
   U.S. sales of prescription pharmaceuticals rose 19% in the
quarter. International sales would have risen 15% without
currency fluctuations and divestitures.
   Schering-Plough Health-Care Products had a 5% sales
decline for the quarter, reflecting trade inventory
adjustments for foot-care and sun-care products, and a weak
cold season that affected sales of cough-cold products.
   Robert P. Luciano, chairman and chief executive,
reiterated his estimate that 1990 earnings per share would be
18% to 20% higher than in 1989, when the company had net
income of $471.3 million, or $4.18 a share, on $3.16 billion
in sales.
   Bristol-Myers Squibb said it had record sales and earnings
for the first quarter. Net income rose to $409.1 million, or
78 cents a share, from $343.6 million, or 66 cents a share.
Sales rose 8.5% to $2.46 billion from $2.26 billion.
   The company said domestic sales rose 6% while
international sales rose 13%; currency fluctuations reduced
sales by less than 1%.
   Separately, Bristol-Myers said it agreed to sell Genetic
Systems Corp., a marketer of diagnostic kits for infectious
diseases, to Sanofi S.A., a French pharmaceutical company,
for an undisclosed sum. Genetic Systems has annual revenue of
about $10 million. Sanofi is majority owned by Societe
Nationale Elf Aquitaine of France.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Schering-Plough closed at $80.875, down $1.125, while
Bristol-Myers closed at $53.375, down 75 cents.

   LSI Logic Plans to Post Quarter Profit,
   Signaling Chip Slump May Be Ending

<LP>
   In a further sign that a year-old chip slump may be
ending, LSI Logic Corp. said it expects to report a return to
profitability for its first quarter after two quarters of net
losses.
   The chip company today expects to post net income of $2.1
million, or five cents a share, for the first quarter ended
April 1. That compares with net of $8 million, or 19 cents a
share, a year earlier, said Wilfred J. Corrigan, LSI's
chairman and chief executive officer. The Milpitas, Calif.,
company earlier was expected to report a slight net loss for
the quarter, he said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Corrigan attributed the favorable results to growing
strength in chip demand as well as to investments in more
efficient factories. LSI's first-quarter sales were up 3.8%
to $139 million, compared with $133.9 million a year earlier,
he said. "There's been a strong up-tick in business," he
said. "What we're seeing is the industry coming out of a slow
period into an expansion period."
   LSI's surprise earnings improvement adds to other signs of
a reviving chip industry. The industry's leading indicator,
the so-called book-to-bill ratio, is at its highest level
since July 1988. Other chip companies, including Intel Corp.
and Motorola Inc. reported improved chip revenue in their
latest quarters. Cypress Semiconductor Corp., reporting
improved earnings earlier this week, said a sudden increase
in demand has left some chips in short supply. Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. partly attributed a first-quarter net-income
increase of 30% to a rise in orders late in the period.
   According to a survey of electronic-parts buyers published
by Electronic Purchasing, a trade journal, "More signs show
that the U.S. electronic industry may be leaving the doldrums
behind." According to the survey, "more buyers are placing
larger orders of electronic parts . . . and most say prices
and stockpiles of parts are stabilizing."
   LSI's improved profits are welcome relief for the company
after a string of bad quarters. The company's net income
began slipping in the second quarter of 1989, and LSI saw a
third-quarter net loss of $35.7 million that included a
special restructuring charge. LSI ended the year with a
fourth-quarter loss of $1.7 million and a net loss of $24.9
million for the entire year.
   "The third quarter of last year was the bottom of the
recession" in chips, said Mr. Corrigan. LSI's earnings were
also hurt last year by the cost of shutting down old factory
lines and setting up and improving new ones, including lines
in Europe and Japan.
   Analysts were expecting the company to report a
first-quarter net loss of about four cents a share, LSI said.
But demand picked up throughout the quarter, and the
company's book-to-bill ratio, the ratio of new orders to
shipments, for the quarter grew to 1.2 to 1 from about 1.1 to
1 in the previous quarter, Mr. Corrigan said. The
first-quarter net income includes a $955,000 extraordinary
gain, or two cents a share, on retired convertible debt, he
added.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
LSI stock closed at $9.25, up 50 cents.
   LSI's first-quarter profit also reflects improved profit
margins from its more efficient factories, which are
operating at higher capacity than last year, Mr. Corrigan
said. Gross margins were 29% for the quarter, up more than
two percentage points from the prior quarter, he said. "We
feel we've gone in and straightened out a lot of the
problems," he said. And with the improved chip market, "we've
got the wind at our back."
   LSI's order backlog and the new factories augur well for
the current quarter, when increased orders will translate
into revenue growth. Mr. Corrigan said he expects revenue in
the second quarter ended July 2 to grow 10% over first
quarter revenue. He also said he expects net income per share
to be in the double digits.
   Mr. Corrigan said he expected added revenue this year from
new products, such as a previously introduced LSI chip set
that allows computer makers to build clones of a popular Sun
Microsystems Inc. workstation. "There's no question that the
introduction of microprocessors has created a burst of
activity" from which significant sales volume will come by
the end of the year, he said. Those microprocessors will
generate sales in other LSI chips too, he said.

   Union Pacific Profit
   Slips 7% in Quarter;
   Interest Costs Cited

   NEW YORK -- Union Pacific Corp. first-quarter net income
declined 7%, largely because of higher interest costs related
to a stock repurchase program. But it said railroad and
natural-resources earnings were strong.
   The company, based in Bethlehem, Pa., sidetracked plans to
dispose of its natural-resource assets. Drew Lewis, chief
executive, told a meeting of securities analysts here that he
decided not to undertake at an initial public offering of the
company's Union Pacific Resources unit at this time.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Union Pacific posted first-quarter net of $128 million, or
$1.27 a share, compared with $138 million, or $1.22 a share,
a year earlier. The increase in per-share earnings reflected
the decline in the average number of common shares
outstanding to 100.6 million from 112.9 million a year
earlier due to the share buy-back program.
   Mr. Lewis said Union Pacific Railroad earnings increased
2% to $127 million, despite the sluggish economy and higher
fuel costs. The company said quarterly carloadings were up 2%
over the year earlier quarter. Union Pacific Resources'
income increased 31% to $63 million with hydrocarbon volumes
rising 8%.
   Mr. Lewis said he expects the company to meet or slightly
exceed analysts' estimates of 1990 net per share of $5.60 to
$5.85 a share. In 1989, Union Pacific earned $5.62 a share.
   First-quarter earnings of Union Pacific's trucking unit,
Overnite Transportation, declined 33% to $8 million from $12
million. Union Pacific also said its corporate services costs
of $73 million in the first quarter represented a $22 million
increase from the year-earlier quarter, largely due to the
increased interest costs associated with the buy-back
program.
   The executive said he decided against an initial public
offering of the company's oil and gas resources. "We just
don't see the value we think this company is worth being
realized by an IPO," Mr. Lewis said. He added after the
meeting that "IPO's are not doing well. I'm not going to put
{Resources} out now and have a turkey."
   Mr. Lewis said he would not recommend an initial public
offering of Union Pacific Resources unless "we see the asset
value of the company considerably north of $4 billion. I'm
not going to do it at $3 billion." Union Pacific's outside
advisers had valued Resources in the neighborhood of $3
billion, he said.
   Some analysts were disappointed because they had expected
a further restructuring of the company's resources unit;
Union Pacific had sold off its pipeline and refining
properties in late 1988. Mr. Lewis was still talking publicly
last January about the possibility of an initial public
offering for a portion of Union Pacific Resources. Union
Pacific continues to liquidate most of its real estate
holdings.
   "Union Pacific has decided to develop its resource assets
with the available cash flow from the railroad rather than
simply giving ownership to the shareholders," said Michael
Lloyd, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. After the
announcement, Mr. Lloyd changed his Union Pacific rating to a
"neutral" from a "buy." He said, "If Union Pacific Resources
was a free-standing company, oil and gas analysts would pay
more attention to it, and perhaps it would attract some
suitors."

   If the ordinary Swissies knew about him they'd inform
against him too . . . it's a national sport.
   -- "A Perfect Spy," by John le Carre

<TEXT>
   BERN, Switzerland -- The secretive Swiss are having
trouble with snooping. And this time it isn't with foreign
governments trying to pry open numbered bank accounts. It's
the Swiss spying on each other.
   This little-known Swiss pastime, which Mr. le Carre
discovered during his student days at Bern University, has
surfaced to become one of the liveliest scandals in recent
Swiss history.
   It all began in November with a government-published
paperback book entitled "PUK," which stands for Parliamentary
Investigation Commission. Now a bestseller, "PUK" documents
the discoveries of federal legislators delegated to
investigate the Swiss Justice Department under Elisabeth
Kopp, former justice minister. Ms. Kopp resigned her post in
January 1989 after admitting that she informed her husband he
was on the board of a company tied to a money-laundering
probe.
   The 228-page "PUK" diligently examines the workings of the
ministry, outlining a largely expected chain of events. But
between pages 154 and 190 was a bombshell: The federal police
for decades had kept extensive files on ordinary citizens.
   About 900,000 files were discovered by the investigating
legislators, who often found themselves looking at their own
dossiers. Two-thirds of the files referred to foreigners, but
the Swiss weren't concerned about those. It was the 300,000
files on Swiss citizens and organizations that stirred the
emotions.
   Fed by village policemen, fellow workers or neighbors, the
archives brought into focus a rare picture of the universal
interest of national-security watchdogs. A liberal
politician's visit to a film on Chinese pandas was recorded.
A youth-organization employee discovered that her switch from
a yellow to a red Renault was of significance. A middle-aged
Social Democratic member of parliament was on a secret list
since the age of 17. One lady landed in the police files
after signing a petition against genetic engineering.
Opponents of nuclear energy seemed sure game for a mention if
they signed a petition.
   The country of 6.4 million was chagrined. The report
suggested that a national-security organization was needed to
combat foreign espionage and terrorism. But here were
"trivial details" of no importance for national security.
   What's more, once a person got into the system, he never
seemed to get out. Some of the files were on people long
since dead. A respected trade unionist found his file with a
notation dating from his youth. Someone wrote that the
then-teen had nice parents but was himself somewhat wild.
   The investigating members of parliament said: "The
gathering of useless material is to be stopped." They called
for the files to be purged and for measures to be instituted
to protect civil liberties.
   An embarrassed Swiss government apologized for the "hurt"
done to citizens by the files; people were asked to write to
Bern to request a look at their dossiers. A lot have,
including Social Democrat Rudolf H. Strahm, a first
lieutenant in the country's militia army. His file was a bit
of a shock. It read: "Registered on the list of suspect
officers, according to the military security service."
   Mr. Strahm promptly went to the press and dropped another
bombshell, this time on the military. The Swiss Defense
Department had denied the existence of a list of suspicious
military men. Now it had to admit to keeping a register of
left-leaning officers.
   From then on, secret files came out of the woodwork with
regularity, including a discontinued list of "extremists," a
forgotten list of those to be interned in case of war, an old
list of suspicious government officials, and over 100,000
secret photos.
   Revelations of a secret army took over the headlines for a
while, to the despair of the defense minister. Apparently in
the 1970s, resistance fighters -- local citizens, trained on
weekends in secret locations -- were ready in case of an
invasion of Switzerland.
   Meanwhile, Swiss government officials seem to be getting
weary of apologizing to citizens. Of the Bachmann affair,
Defense Minister Kaspar Villiger grumbled: "I really do have
problems understanding this furor over so-called revelations
that are more than 10 years old."
   Now parliament has approved another investigation, PUK 2,
which will look into the doings of the Defense Department;
the investigation is limited to intelligence gathering only.
Mr. Villiger has warned that foreign secret services are
getting nervous about Switzerland's recent burst of openness.
However, despite the fact that citizens are given access to
their files, the identification of informants continues to be
kept secret.
   Meanwhile, up to 7,000 requests a day are pouring into the
Justice Department as citizens seek to look into their files.
Leading writers, artists and musicians have said that they
will boycott Switzerland's celebration of its 700-year
anniversary in 1991 unless the "political police" are
abolished. A group against "snooper state Switzerland" will
start gathering signatures to force a referendum to abolish
the domestic security police.
   Not everyone is outraged. "The problem with Switzerland is
that everything goes so well -- no unemployment or real
problems," said Hans Ulrich Doerig, an executive board member
of bank Credit Suisse. "If it were otherwise, Switzerland
wouldn't be making such a big deal out of this."
   While conceding that changes are needed, some legislators
have warned against drastic action. "It is irresponsible, in
light of organized crime, drug trafficking and other evils,
to talk about dismantling our national security," insisted
Eva Segmueller, president of the Christian Democratic Party.
   Historians point out that Switzerland has had active
national security police for a century. "The federal police
and prosecutor's office are exactly 100 years old and for
nearly 100 years they have used the same methods," said Erich
Gruner, a leading Swiss political scientist.
   Nevertheless, Prof. Gruner thinks changes are needed. "Up
till now the police brain has believed that anyone who
diverts from the Swiss norm is a potential enemy of the
state," he said.
   Since the 1950s, Switzerland has been governed by a
coalition of leading parties represented in a seven-member
federal council. Known as the "magic formula," the
arrangement is largely responsible for the country's
stability.
   But in the wake of the snooper scandal, there are
questions over whether this coalition system needs change.
Social Democrat Thomas Onken said recently in a speech in
parliament: "We lack the culture of opposition, the bite." He
pointed out that the federal council has known of the secret
files, if not their extent, through quarterly reports from
the public prosecutor's office. He accused parliament of
showing "too little curiosity" about what was going on in its
secret service.
   Urs Altermatt, a prominent historian, is calling for a
major change. "We must rethink our situation," he said. "My
feeling is that we must go to a system where there is a
political opposition. Then people will have a real choice
when they vote."

   SEOUL, South Korea -- U.S. trade officials said they were

Korea off a pending U.S. list of unfair trade partners.
   Korean news reports Thursday had claimed the U.S. agreed
to drop South Korea from the list of unfair traders if Seoul
joins the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's government
procurement code. These are international rules that govern
government purchases of imported goods. But a U.S. official,
in Seoul for several days of trade talks, said that no such
promise had been made. She said that President Bush will make
that decision based on recommendations from various
government departments and agencies.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 1988 U.S. Trade Act requires the president to list by
April 30 each year those countries practicing unfair trade.
South Korea is the fourth largest supplier of goods to the
U.S. government, but doesn't have clear rules on buying
imported goods for government use. "While we were encouraged
by the information we heard," the Washington official said,
"no one piece of information will determine the outcome."
   Even acceptance of the GATT government procurement code
won't necessarily end disagreements on government purchases
of U.S. products. Japan was an early signatory to the code
and the U.S. still faces significant Japanese reluctance to
buy U.S. goods.
   The trade negotiators also discussed a host of other
issues, including implementation of prior agreements.
"Generally speaking, we are pleased with the way the
agreements are being implemented," said a U.S. official, who
asked not to be identified. "There are minor problems, but
that is always the case."
   The trade officials also are preparing final adjustments
to a trade agreement on U.S. beef imports into Korea. The
agreement was worked out in Washington last month and a U.S.
official said the agreement could be signed next week.
   The working-level officials also established an official
group to review technical regulations for food safety that
affect agricultural imports by both nations. There have been
numerous tiffs between the two countries on imported products
that may or may not have carried harmful pesticides.
Officials agreed to postpone discussions on
telecommunications disputes.
   The South Korean government also presented complaints to
the U.S., including its claims that American tobacco
companies market their products unfairly and that U.S.
regulations for imported fruit aren't clear.

   India's Military Buildup Has Sparked
   Neighborhood Arms Race in South Asia

   NEW DELHI (AP) -- Arms reduction may be the order of the
day for the superpowers, but India's drive to become the next
military giant has scuttled hopes of a "peace dividend" in
economically strapped south Asia.
   India's neighbors, especially Pakistan, are following its
lead in the buildup. Western military analysts and Indian
intellectuals fear another chapter of an expensive regional
arms race is about to begin.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the Soviet Union withdraws troops from Eastern
Europe and the U.S. plans defense cuts, India's defense
budget for 1990 is more than 10% above last year.
   Between 1985 and 1989, India bought more weapons -- $17.3
billion worth -- than any country in the world.
   In response, Pakistan's President Ghulam Ishaq Khan vowed
to continue stockpiling advanced weapons. Pakistan already
allocates 52% of its $6.8 billion federal budget for defense.
   China recently announced a defense spending increase of
15.2% over 1989.
   "There will be no peace dividend in south Asia," said Ian
Anthony, an expert on the Indian military at the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute in Sweden. "India
thinks a strong military will give it international prestige.
I think they've got it wrong."
   Mr. Anthony and other Western military analysts say India
is the engine driving the arms buildup in the region. More
important than recent tensions with Pakistan, they say, is
India's desire to achieve military might.
   "India already has enough troops to smother Pakistan in a
protracted war," said a Western military official in New
Delhi. "They have their sights on longterm military role."
   Western economists and Indian intellectuals say the
buildup is harming India's economy and the economies of the
region's other developing countries.
   India already has fallen behind in the world's economic
race.
   Pakistan has the highest per capita gross national product
in the region, only $350 a year, and a host of domestic
problems that include a burgeoning drug trade and ethnic
violence.
   Bangladesh and Nepal, two of the poorest countries in the
world, spend large amounts of their foreign exchange on
weapons.
   Some say India is seeking entry into the mighty club for
reasons of pride.
   "Weaklings are not honored. We want to be strong," A.P.J.
Abdul Kalam, father of India's first intermediate-range
ballistic missile, said soon after the rocket's test firing
last May.
   Others feel India wants to assume the role its former
colonial masters, the British, once played in south Asia.
India isn't seeking to colonize the region, they say, but it
wants to be viewed as the protector of its smaller neighbors.
   "The British dominated the subcontinent. They guaranteed
its security," said Giri Deshingkar, director of the Center
for the Study of Developing Societies. "India's military
wants to do the same."
   The fall of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi late last year led
development experts to hope that the defense budget, which
has jumped 400% in a decade, might be cut.
   But troubles with Pakistan strengthened the military
lobby, experts said, and hopes that Prime Minister V.P.
Singh's government would channel more money to education and
health soon evaporated.
   On March 19, the new government announced a 10.5% rise in
defense spending to $9.3 billion. The bulk of the increase
went for arms purchases.
   In a speech late last month, India's chief of naval staff,
Adm. J.G. Nadkarni, argued that military might, not economic
development, was the key to power.
   "There are few things that India can do that can get this
country greater leverage with the great powers than interfere
with their plans," Mr. Nadkarni said.
   The mere capability to interfere with superpower movement
in international waters, the admiral said, would cause them
to think twice before crossing India diplomatically.
   "It's basic gunboat diplomacy," said one Western military
officer. "We don't think it will work."

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Music:
   Composer Tailors Piece to Pei Hall
   ----
   By Willard Spiegelman

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12

<LP>
   Dallas -- Earth Day isn't coming any too soon for Henry
Brant. For nearly 40 years, this peculiarly American composer
has written music for the environment. His pieces have hymned
hot springs and geysers and they have resonated in defense of
poisoned earth and air. His double-bass concerto "Ghost Nets"
(1988) rumbled in distress over the wanton slaughter of
dolphins and other Pacific marine animals. And last year, his
requiem "Rainforest" mourned the destruction of equatorial
jungles.
   This preoccupation with ecology grows organically, so to
speak, out of Mr. Brant's basic practice as a composer, since
he often writes site-specific music that can be performed
only in the place for which it was conceived. This has
assured his uniqueness -- and his relative anonymity.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   His pieces tend to have limited runs (new works are
forthcoming in Boston, San Francisco, Saratoga Springs, N.Y.,
and San Jose, Calif.), but some of them are, quite literally,
unhearable and unrecordable because they take place across a
vast territory. And they usually are unrepeatable. Whatever
Christo is to the visual arts, Henry Brant is to music.
   Last week, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, under the batons
of Mr. Brant, James Rives-Jones and six others, premiered the
latest Brant work, "Prisons of the Mind," at the Morton H.
Meyerson Symphony Center here. And Mr. Brant took his cue
from the same sources that inspired I.M. Pei's design for the
hall's marble and granite planes, curvilinear glass and
ever-changing shafts of light. Like Mr. Pei, Mr. Brant
studied Piranesi's series of sketches, "Carceri d'Invenzione"
("Imaginary Prisons"), which originally were executed in the
18th century.
   Those fantastic, labyrinthine drawings, all high spaces,
unfathomable depths and peculiar vanishing points, in which
human beings, when present, seem to perform rituals at once
medieval and technological, gave Mr. Pei the idea for the
Meyerson's grand public spaces, which are deliberately
overwhelming, in contrast to the intimate shoe- or
jewel-box-like interior of the concert hall itself.
   All composers write for spaces, at least in theory, and
all sound comes through space, but Mr. Brant has been
practicing a uniquely space-conscious art since 1951 when,
according to his own account, he heard the Berlioz Requiem in
Paris, and shortly thereafter conducted Charles Ives's "The
Unanswered Question" and the canzone of Gabrieli at
Juilliard. Since then, his compositions have involved such
unlikely combinations as 80 trombones and organ ("Orbits,
1979"); orchestra, choirs, jazz band, gamelan ensemble and
African drummers ("Meteor Farm," 1982); and, in his most
ambitious piece before "Prisons," four traveling barges, each
containing 25 flutists and a jazz drummer, plus church
carillons, three brass bands and four hand-organs, all
deployed at different points throughout the canals and
central square of Amsterdam ("Fire on the Amstel," 1984).
   The 77-year-old composer, who looks like a combination of
Woody Allen and Peter Pan, revealed some of his mysterious
intentions for "Prisons" when he spoke gnomically to the
opening-night audience, and remarked that some prisons of the
mind are menacing and some seductive.
   For this reason, he scored "Prisons" for 314 players and
eight conductors. On stage sat two identical orchestras of
strings, harp, piano, percussion and tuba. Above each half of
the orchestra was a group of woodwinds; between them, in the
space of the yet unfinished organ, stood three trombonists.
Two brass ensembles occupied the front section of an
upper-level balcony. Two invisible local high school bands
were located within the distinctive reverberation chambers
(designed by acoustician Russell Johnson) at the top of the
house, and next to them, at the very back, were two
steel-band ensembles. The performers were symmetrically
placed, each group opposite its mirror half.
   Menace and seduction are indeed the principal moods set by
the piece, in its seven sections played without pause. As if
working progressively through layers of orchestral sound,
"Prisons" begins with the winds, continues with the on-stage
strings in glimmers of a haunting melody that gradually is
augmented by the timpani. The tubas threaten; the off-stage
bands initially return echoes from the above and the beyond.
The brass in the rafters sounds Gabrielian anthems. The sound
comes and goes in waves.
   The composition seems to be about matters of provocation
and response; one group inspires either its symmetrical
opposite or one of the other groups in the hall. The texture
of individual sounds is more significant than melodic
substance. Most important of all is origination: For all the
apparent sameness in its symmetries and reflected harmonies,
"Prisons" challenges the ear most by avoiding the usual
full-frontal assaults of music from the traditional concert
repertory. Sound is everywhere, surrounding but variable.
Listening to the piece both from the floor and from an upper
balcony, one realized that Mr. Brant intended it to have a
sonically dizzying quality. The sounds from above pour down,
washing the auditor in the full spectrum of musical colors.
   In this way, the composer has translated Piranesi's
vertiginous perspectives into music. With brass and
percussion ringing from all over the hall, one often feels
that the sound is coming from within one's own head, or from
some highly refined Walkman.
   Abrasive or strident sounds (what I took to be the prisons
of menace) alternate with suppler, more delicate ones. We get
the sense, especially with the woodwinds, of a haunting
reminiscence, something perhaps heard before but largely
unidentifiable. This must be what Mr. Brant referred to as
the seductive kind of prison. Ending with the calypso
syncopations of the steel drums, physically the most distant
instruments (and part of a more foreign culture as well),
"Prisons" comes to a quiet halt with faint echoes, whispers
of remembrance of another time and place. The last sounds
come from the off-stage brass, reverberating for four seconds
into silence, and then sinking back into the architecture.

   NEW YORK -- Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s first-quarter profit
surged 21% on an 8% increase in sales as each of its major
businesses and geographical markets posted gains.
   The consumer-product company posted net income of $81.2
million, or $1.16 a share, up from $67.2 million, or 98 cents
a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $1.3 billion from $1.2
billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The results reflect the company's "growing global
strength," said Reuben Mark, chairman, president and chief
executive officer. In the Western Hemisphere, the company
said, Mexico, Brazil and Canada turned in strong profit
gains. And profit has begun to improve at Colgate-Venezuela,
where results last year were affected by poor economic
conditions.
   Profits from U.S. operations were ahead of last year by "a
significant margin," Colgate said. Sales and volume
decreased, but that reflects Colgate's conscious effort to
eliminate less-profitable products. At the same time, Colgate
U.S. is increasing the revenue and profit per case of product
sold, as a result of improved marketing and expense control.
   Improved results in Europe reflected growth in the
southern part of the continent, new productions and the
favorable impact of currencies strengthening against the
dollar, the company said. Thailand, Malaysia and the
Philippines were the biggest contributors for Colgate-Far
East/ Africa, the company said.
   Colgate shares rose 25 cents each to close at $56.625 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   When I was a kid, playing softball in Chicago's McPherson
School playground, my pals and I knew a few things about
strategy. We played little guys shallow and big guys deep.
Very big guys, we walked. We recognized "pull" hitters when
we saw them, and defensed them accordingly. Little did we
suspect that we were partaking of the "complexities and
nuances" of the game.
   Yet according to George F. Will, we were. And we were
being pretty clever, too. Baseball, writes Mr. Will, is "a
game that rewards, and thus elicits, a remarkable level of
intelligence from those who compete." I assume he means
softball, too.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Will is nothing if not serious about his favorite
sport, and the attitude permeates his book "Men at Work: The
Craft of Baseball" (Macmillan, 353 pages, $19.95). A
political commentator by trade, he is a tourist between the
foul lines, but an inquisitive and extraordinarily
nimble-minded one. Moreover, he is adept at summoning
testimony from baseball insiders whose vocabulary and methods
of analysis may be more familar to the average fan's ear than
his own. "There's a lot of stuff goes on," notes Oakland A's
manager Tony LaRussa. That there is.
   Mr. Will breaks his book into four main parts -- managing,
pitching, hitting and fielding -- and draws on experts to
describe the fine points of each. For instance, Baltimore
Oriole shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. confides that, in a steal
situation, he always receives his catcher's throw at the base
instead of reaching forward for it, because a thrown ball
will travel that foot or so a whit faster than he can jerk
back his glove. The subdivisions, however, also serve as
avenues for wide-ranging explorations of the game's history
and trends.
   "Men at Work" isn't light reading, and tends to
over-intellectualize kinds of baseball knowledge that small
boys divine by osmosis. Still, it's more than worth the
effort, and gets my vote as this season's baseball-book
choice if you're reading only one.
   Mr. Wills' seriousness is matched in another new book,
"Nine Sides of the Diamond" (Random House, 371 pages,
$18.95), by David Faulkner. Mr. Faulkner employs a narrower
focus than does Mr. Will, concentrating on the art of
baseball fielding, position by position. This leads to
repetition (good fielders get to Yankee Stadium the same way
violinists get to Carnegie Hall -- practice) and some lengthy
talespinning, such as Bobby Richardson's two-page explanation
of how he snared Willie McCovey's bullet line drive for the
final out of the 1962 Yanks-Giants World Series. The book
succeeds for the same reason "Work" does: the author's skill
in blending instruction, anecdote and lore. Too bad both came
out the same year.
   For the less literary-minded, there's a work that delivers
scads of interesting facts about the game with few
embellishments. It's "The Physics of Baseball" (Perennial
Library, 110 pages, $7.95), by Robert K. Adair. Read it and
you'll learn that a curve ball doesn't "break" but travels in
a smooth arc, that fastballs don't rise or batted balls speed
up after they bounce, and that a 10 mph headwind can turn a
400-foot home run into a 370-foot out. Prof. Adair
illustrates those things mathematically, but you can skip
that.
   "Prophet of the Sandlots" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 279
pages, $18.95), by Mark Winegardner, chronicles a season the
author spent on Midwest backroads with the late Tony
Lucadello, the storied, longtime scout for the Philadelphia
Phillies. Lucadello dispenses bird-dog wisdom ("87% of
baseball is played below the waist"), spends hours searching
under bleachers for lost coins, and despairs for the future
of the game in an era in which the best athletes choose
basketball or football.
   In the end, with no warning to family or friends,
Lucadello blows out his brains on the sidelines of a
small-town Ohio field. Nonetheless, the book eschews pathos,
and stands as a fond monument to an intuitive solo
practitioner of a trade that's fast becoming corporatized.
   The preceding books call for cheery antidotes, and some
are available, perhaps unexpectedly. One might think that
"Sparky]" (Prentice Hall, 264 pages, $18.95), by veteran
Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson with Dan Ewald, would
be full of inside stratagems, but it ain't. Sparky devotes
but one chapter to managing, and a quarter of that is on how
to get along with the news media. He believes that a direct
glance and firm handshake are among a manager's best assets.
I leave it to Mr. Will to dispute him.
   "The Year I Owned the Yankees: A Baseball Fantasy" (Bantam
Books, 313 pages, 17.95), by Sparky Lyle and David Fisher,
has a few good yuks. A conglomerate buys the Steinbrenner
business empire for tax-loss purposes and puts ex-pitcher
Lyle in charge of the baseball team, it's only profitable
part. He makes some cute moves, like hiring Reggie Jackson as
team "ego coach." A 46-year-old New Jersey dentist, recruited
from a fantasy camp, makes the team as a knuckleballer but
opts for dentistry instead. The book is in diary form, and I
admit I didn't get past June. But Yankee-lovers should like
it.
   The pick of the baseball-history books I read was "Two
Spectacular Seasons" (Macmillan, 288 pages, $17.95), by
William B. Mead. It's about the 1930 campaign, when the
hitters dominated, and the 1968 one, when the pitchers did.
Mr. Mead does particularly well with the '30 season, which
was a bonanza for baseball oddments as well as base hits.
   "Yaz" (Doubleday, 300 pages, $19.95), by Carl Yastrzemski
and Gerald Eskenazi, is a bit of a grind, matching the career
of baseball's quintessential grinder. "The Whole Baseball
Catalogue" (Fireside, 370 pages, $17.95), edited by John
Thorne and Bob Carroll, tells about baseball board games,
where to get the best ballpark food in the minor leagues, and
other useful stuff. "Stengel: His Life and Times" (Fireside,
349 pages, $9.95), by Robert W. Creamer, is a welcome
paperback edition of the classic about Ol' Case.

   Hibernia's Earnings Streak Finally Ends

   Banking Firm's Loan
   Portfolio Stirs Concern

   NEW ORLEANS -- For a while, it seemed Hibernia Corp. had
discovered the secret to thriving during the oil-region's
bust.
   While many of its competitors concentrated assets in
energy-related loans, the conservative bank holding company
spread its risk. Since 1986, Hibernia has cut its energy
portfolio from 8% of total loans to about 3.6%. The company,
which hadn't even stretched its lending reach beyond its
parish borders before 1985, has now dispersed about 40% of
its loans out of state. The moves helped the company rack up
64 straight quarters of earnings improvement and propelled it
to star status on Wall Street.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Then Hibernia hiccuped.
   In March, the company said it would post a first-quarter
loss after a tough examination by regulators. Earlier this
week, the company confirmed the bad news. Citing a $50
million special loan-loss provision, Hibernia reported a
first-quarter net loss of $24.9 million, or 92 cents a share,
compared with year-ago net income of $15.2 million, or 57
cents a share. Nonperforming assets, meanwhile, more than
doubled to $139.5 million from $65.9 million at year end.
   Hibernia shrugged off the loss as a onetime glitch,
attributable largely to tough new credit quality standards
being applied by federal bank examiners to spotlight
potential real-estate problems early.
   But some analysts, while still generally bullish on the
stock, are beginning to voice concerns. Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., noting that the loss is expected to reduce tangible
consolidated equity to a relatively thin 5.1% of assets,
downgraded its ratings on Hibernia National Bank's
certificates of deposit to single-A-minus/A-2 from
single-A/A-1, indicating the bank may have to pay a bit more
for some funds. "Even if Hibernia rapidly returns to
profitability, it will need time to strengthen its capital
position," the rating service said.
   Analysts' biggest concern centers around Hibernia's
participation in loan syndicates financing leveraged buy-outs
and other so-called highly leveraged transactions, or HLTs.
At year-end, the company had 92 HLT loans outstanding,
totalling $623 million, or 13.1% of the loan portfolio. HLT
loans, in general, involve higher risk for banks because the
borrower's debt load is so high. The risk can be exacerbated
by the fact that banks that buy pieces of loan syndications
often aren't intimately familiar with the borrower's
operations, and may have a hard time predicting default
rates.
   "The big concern I have is that nobody really knows what
level of a portfolio of loans to HLTs goes bad," says Peter
Tuz, an analyst with Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs
Inc., New Orleans. "It's just a new animal -- it hasn't been
around for 10 years or 15 years."
   Frank Anderson, an analyst with Stephens Inc., Little
Rock, Ark., worries that, if the economy nosedives, Hibernia
may see an additional $30 million to $50 million in HLT loans
become nonperforming. "Let's face it, if you've got $600
million of HLT credits . . . you know you'll get some more go
nonperforming," he says.
   There have already been some troublesome signs for
Hibernia. According to Mr. Tuz, the bank's recent loan
participations include credits totaling about $30 million to
a unit of Campeau Corp.'s Federated Department Stores Inc.,
Doskocil Cos. and Jim Walter Corp. Federated, Doskocil and
Jim Walter have since filed for bankruptcy-court protection
from creditors.
   Meanwhile, there are also some concerns about Hibernia's
rapid growth -- it has grown to $7.2 billion in assets from
$2 billion in five years -- much of which has been funded by
expensive jumbo certificates of deposit that have squeezed
net interest margins. At year end, Hibernia had about $1.78
billion in time deposits over $100,000, or about 30% of total
deposits, according to Sheshunoff Information Services Inc.
That's about twice the national average for banks. Which
helps explain why net interest margins have shriveled from
4.68% at the end of 1987 to 4.1% by the end of this year's
first quarter.
   Hibernia officials, while declining to comment on specific
credits, say concerns about the HLT portfolio are overblown.
Noting the analysts' concern over its exposure to troubled
leveraged buy-outs, O.C. Russell, vice chairman of Hibernia
National Bank, said that "$30 million out of a $5 billion
loan portfolio is not a big problem for an institution with
$109 million in reserves.
   At year end, Hibernia officials note, just $9.9 million in
loans, or 1.59% of the HLT portfolio, had stopped accruing
interest, while an additional $26.6 million were classified
as performing but "subject to potential future difficulties"
in meeting repayment terms. Figures for the first quarter
weren't immediately available.
   Hibernia's HLT portfolio also is shrinking. At the end of
the first quarter, HLT exposure had declined to $569 million
and Hibernia says it plans to reduce that to $525 million by
year end. Mr. Russell points out that Hibernia scrutinizes
every loan participation with their own stable of
underwriters, whether or not Hibernia is the lead bank.
   Moreover, he adds, the company is confident that it has
adequate reserves to cover any problems. He noted that the
$50 million loan-loss provision maintained Hibernia's reserve
level at a conservative 110% of nonperforming loans, despite
the increase in nonperforming assets.
   Hibernia officials insist that the future is bright and
that it will soon return to profitability and to its
objective of a minimum 16% return on equity.
   Part of that hope stems from the company's expansion in
nearby Texas. During 1989, Hibernia acquired 10 failed banks
and thrifts in the state, as part of its plan to suck up
low-cost core deposits and find new markets for loan growth.
The acquisitions pushed the banking company's total Texas
deposits to $586 million by the end of the first quarter. And
Hibernia isn't through. Eventually, the company hopes to
corral about $1 billion in assets in each of the four major
Texas markets -- Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio.
Hibernia currently has about $600 million of assets in the
state.
   Hibernia Chairman Martin C. Miler has referred to the
company as a "muscular dwarf," and it will have to flex a
good deal of that muscle to survive in Texas against giants
such as NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., which has around $30
billion in Texas assets; Chemical Banking Corp.'s $18
billion-asset Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. unit; and Banc
One Corp., Columbus, Ohio, which has another $14 billion.
"The competition for the retail business in Texas is going to
get even hotter than it is," says John Russell, a Banc One
spokesman. "Smaller players in the market are going to have a
tough time getting heard."
   Hibernia won't disclose its results in Texas, but
officials insist the investment is performing well.
   Hibernia's most effective argument that the future is
bright is to point to its recent past. As it has grown in the
past five years, the once-somnolent banking concern has moved
from an also-ran in the New Orleans market to the dominant
bank in Louisiana. Its five-year return on equity has
averaged 17.4% and it boasts the third-lowest overhead ratio
among bank holding companies of its size.
   "Over the years we've managed to avoid the malaise of the
oil industry very adroitly, and I think we'll do likewise" in
the HLT realm, Mr. Russell says.

   GM Quietly Raises Prices on Options Despite Soft Sales

   DETROIT -- Despite sluggish consumer demand for many of
its cars, General Motors Corp. has quietly raised prices for
options that could increase the cost of some of its cars and
trucks by up to $100.
   GM's pricing action follows a similar move last month by
rival auto maker Ford Motor Co., and continues a pattern set
by GM and Ford last year of raising prices on optional
equipment early in the spring selling season. This year, Ford
raised the prices for options on most cars by an average of
$29. GM officials said they couldn't determine the average
increase that would result from its changes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The price increases will help the No. 1 and No. 2 auto
makers boost revenues per car and bolster earnings in a weak
market. But they might also be a competitive liability.
Officials of Chrysler Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda
Motor Co. said their companies haven't increased prices since
the model year began last fall.
   Unlike Ford, GM didn't officially announce its increase,
but quietly notified its dealers of the changes.
   Dealer reaction ranged from frustration to resignation.
"We can't sell cars as it is," said Boston dealer Robert
Brest, who sells several GM lines. With most rebate programs
scheduled to end soon, Mr. Brest figures GM will do something
to stimulate showroom traffic. "They must have something up
their sleeves."
   Other dealers said the increases won't make much
difference. "They may as well raise prices when they're not
selling cars," said a Pontiac dealer in New Jersey.
   Both GM and Ford have been struggling to prop up sales in
recent weeks in the face of soft consumer demand. Sales of
all domestic and imported vehicles dropped 2.9% in March
despite heavy discounting by the Big Three and many foreign
car makers. GM's total vehicle sales dropped 1.3% in March,
while Ford's fell 6.1%.
   A GM spokesman said yesterday the company raised the
option prices to recover higher costs for raw materials and
health care. "We believe that these are modest adjustments,"
a GM spokesman said, adding that the company considered what
the marketplace would bear before raising prices.
   The changes will affect GM's most popular options, such as
cruise control, power door locks and power windows. Prices
for those items increased $15 apiece. Now the most expensive
power door lock system will cost $280, the most expensive
power window system will cost $325, and cruise control will
cost an average of $210.
   GM didn't change prices on air conditioning. Before last
summer, the auto maker had discounted some of its options
when sold together as a group. But last summer the company
halted that practice in most of its divisions.
   Price increases on power seats will range from $20 to $55.
GM also hit some of its pickup trucks with a $20 rise on
optional gasoline engines and a $10 increase on four-speed
automatic transmissions.
   The changes apply to all of GM's auto divisions, but
Cadillac will be the least affected because many of the
options are standard on most of its luxury cars.
   Because the price increases affect GM cars built after
April 2, consumers should pay less for cars built earlier in
the year that are still sitting on dealer lots.

   The Best Earth Day Present: Freedom

ENVIRONMENT (ENV)

<LP>
   Since the first Earth Day in 1970, there has been a lot of
good news on the environment. The deserts of the Sahel may
not be spreading after all. And Lake Erie is no longer dead;
its waters now team with tens of millions of walleye. But the
best environmental news of all is the opening of the Berlin
Wall and the democratization of Latin America.
   A very large proportion of the globe's environmental
problems are caused by policies that cannot stand the
scrutiny of either the marketplace or the voting booth.
Sweeping world trends -- political, economic, and
technological -- are fundamentally changing the globe's
environmental ground rules for the better.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Take Eastern Europe, the dirtiest, most degraded region on
Earth. Eighty percent of East Germany's rivers are
contaminated, and some of its citizens breathe air polluted
50 times above safe limits; two-thirds of Poland's trees are
damaged, two-thirds of its rivers too dirty even for
industry; 80% of Bulgaria's farmland is threatened by
erosion, 25% of its animal and plant species are threatened.
Throughout the Eastern Bloc life expectancy has been
dropping, with millions suffering from environmentally
induced disease. Some Eastern Europeans can expect to live a
decade less than Western Europeans.
   Now all this is being swept away by democracy and economic
rationality. One of the first steps taken by the transitional
government in post-communist Czechoslovakia -- where posters
denouncing nuclear power vied for power with those denouncing
communist rule -- was the cancellation of a reactor under
construction. In East Germany the notoriously unsafe nuclear
reactor at Griefswald on the Baltic coast has been shut down
and, with West German help, East Germans are investing $250
million in advanced coal-burning technologies and in
incinerators for the disposal of chemical wastes. Poland is
cleaning up the Vistula River by building 188 large water
purification plants to treat municipal sewage and industrial
wastes and 200 smaller plants for highly toxic chemical
wastes.
   In Latin America, too, the winds of change have toppled
one junta after another, replacing them with popularly
elected leaders who offer hope of meaningful reform --
environmental as well as economic. The slashing of the
Brazilian rainforests -- 50,000 square kilometers were being
cleared in 1989 -- was the consequence of economic approaches
remarkably similar to those of Eastern Europe. Central
planning authorities were recklessly promoting industrial
expansion, regardless of profitability, while property
rights, always a bulwark against unfettered central planning,
were undermined.
   The first elected president to rule Brazil in 25 years,
Fernando Collor de Mello, has promised to drop many of the
policies that have simultaneously polluted his country and
mired it in debt. He is proposing a moratorium on new
incentives, subsidies and credits to businesses that cause a
negative environmental impact in any region, and taxes on
polluters and users of natural resources. Electricity rates
have been raised nearer to market levels and agricultural
sprawl -- blamed for forest clearings -- is being curbed by
the elimination of the tax breaks that helped to cause it in
the first place. As important, Mr. Collor is attempting to
settle property disputes with Brazil's native people; at the
request of Yanomami Indians, he is using force to evict from
the Indians' rainforest land some 45,000 prospectors.
   Entrenched interests in both Eastern Europe and Latin
America -- powerful bureaucracies in the former, military and
land-owning aristocracy in the latter -- are likely to delay
and perhaps halt the tempo of reform. But technological
change is on the side of ecological progress.
   Ten years ago, a Third World community faced with the
flooding of its farmland by a state hydroelectric project or
the removal of its forests for subsidized pulp production was
all but helpless. Generally it was given no say in the
decision, let alone compensation for the loss of its
property, and Westerners would learn of the project too late
to intervene, even though the project was typically built by
Western engineers using Western tax dollars.
   Today, that community is as likely as not to have a fax
machine or to be able to reach local environmentalists who --
via fax, phone or electronic mail -- can reach a global
network of environmental, human rights and native rights
activists. Within days, the project's developers can be
identified, environmentalists in the country involved can be
enlisted and an international campaign mounted. Though most
projects nevertheless proceed to completion, through this
process literally dozens of ill-conceived projects are being
stopped, and hundreds more slowed or improved. As the ease of
communication rises and as information flows improve through
increased trade and travel, the rejection rate for bad
projects can only increase.
   The good news isn't universal: In regions such as Africa,
where political and economic reforms have been slow to
materialize, and where communication technologies tend to be
strictly controlled (Kenyans, for example, need government
permission to use a computer modem), environmentalists must
often work in secret, and suffer debilitating intimidation
much as their counterparts in Latin America did under
military rule.
   But in Chile and Argentina once-muzzled environmental
critics of government policy now find themselves in positions
of power. In Brazil, Jose Lutzemberger, one of the world's
most outspoken defenders of the rainforest and the founder of
the first environmental group to challenge the generals,
Agapan, now finds himself secretary of the environment. With
information he gets from daily satellite surveys, he claims
that "no destruction of the environment can happen in this
county, even pollution . . . that can be hidden." He is
hopeful that this access to information will further "a
capitalist perestroika," that revamps the tax system,
eliminating destructive subsidies, removing power from big
landowners and protecting the rights of the inhabitants of
the last wilderness.
   Nor is capitalist perestroika confined to the Third World.
The drying up of state subsidies to the petroleum industry
has rid North America of most new tar sands, oil shale,
frontier and other environmentally harmful and economically
wasteful energy megaprojects. In Britain, privatization
pulled the plug on nuclear power expansion by forcing
investors to see nuclear power and all its latent liabilities
from an owner's point of view.
   The U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement is likely to hasten
the adoption of higher U.S. environmental standards in
Canada, just as the European Community has leaned on member
states to raise their water standards up to the levels of the
cleaner members. Strong freedom-of-information laws -- the
one reform environmentalists around the world agree on --
hinder cover-ups, and provide the public with knowledge and
resolve.
   World-wide, power has shifted away from the remote elites
of the national and international bureaucracies, whose
understanding of local economies and environments is
necessarily limited. The Sahel exemplifies that limited
understanding: At an international conference in 1977, the
Nairobi-based United Nations Environment Program pronounced
-- on the scantiest of information -- that the Saharan desert
was advancing an average of six kilometers a year, and
pointed fingers at peasant practices that supposedly degraded
the land. As satellite studies and ground surveys from the
World Conservation Union now show, the emergency that the UN
and other outsiders saw was a mirage.
   The costly emergency measures they championed -- chiefly a
green Maginot Line to defend against desert creep -- were
unwarranted and sometimes counterproductive. Despite droughts
and rapid population growth, the land of the Sahel has become
increasingly bountiful over the years. The people are coping
admirably, despite perverse government policies that, for
instance, discouraged tree planting by expropriating local
lands.
   Not surprisingly, the methods that have helped the
peasants of the Sahel and their environment survive these
past few thousand years continue to have merit. If people
throughout the globe are to do better for themselves and
their environment, as is usually their desire, the answer
will be in more, not less freedom for their communities.

   BEIJING -- Nearly four million people were laid off in
China last year, pushing the urban unemployment rate to 2.6%
from 2% at the end of 1988, the English-language China Daily
quoted an unidentified Labor Ministry official as saying.
   The official said 10 million urban residents will be
seeking work this year, including 3.78 million people laid
off last year, as China's economy stalled, and three million
young people entering the job market. Some Chinese economists
have put urban unemployment at 4%. The government has said
2.9 million people were jobless last July 31.

   A government austerity program aimed at cutting inflation
has caused thousands of money-pinched factories to close and
forced the suspension of thousands of labor-intensive
construction projects.
   As many as 30 million of the nation's some 140 million
urban workers are underemployed, meaning they have little or
nothing to do on their jobs. The government, to avoid labor
unrest, has told state-run enterprises to keep workers on the
payroll even when there is no work.

   THE HOTTEST international executive may not be found on
American shores. According to a report by recruiter Saxton
Bampfylde International, demand is exploding for the
Euro-Executive, a rare hybrid who commands a premium for
running pan-Europe operations.
   Ideally, the Euro-Exec comes from a smaller country, such
as Holland, has a mixed background, early exposure to other
cultures, "and a flexible cast of mind." The London firm's
report cites a half-Irish half-French ad man married to an
American, living in Brussels who speaks three languages and
has worked as a manufacturing salesman and an organizer of
Paris social events.
   But most fall short of the ideal. Among them: the
Euro-Yuppie, who has a pan-European identity but lacks
experience, and the Senior Statesman, who hails from a
multinational, often American. He is "almost always too . . .
corporate," the report warns, "his view of the world . . .
colored by being -- at its extreme -- an IBMer."
   Americans do have one plus, says Anthony Saxton of Saxton
Bampfylde: Their 50-states background gives them a grasp of
the Europe-without-borders idea.
   U.S. executives may have the most trouble filling slots in
East Europe, where Western Europeans have an edge. More of
them speak East European languages and have done business
there, notes Scott Scanlon, co-editor of Executive Search
Review.
   Moreover, there's some "prejudice towards {U.S.}
executives, who can be perceived as trying to export a `hire
and fire' mentality," says Paul R. Ray Jr., a recruiter with
offices in Texas and Belgium. Eagerness for Western ways, he
adds, doesn't equal desire for the American Way.
                                                                                                       

   The Invisible Barrier
   Is Crystal Clear to Many
                                                                                                       

   THE "GLASS CEILING" for women executives may be hard to
break through because it's still heavily glazed with
stereotypes.
   In a survey by Catalyst, a New York group that promotes
women's careers, 79% of Fortune 500 chief executive officers
admitted there are "identifiable barriers" to women getting
to the top, and 81% blamed "stereotyping and preconceptions."
   They didn't say their own companies were culprits. But
they did have ideas on what women could do. Women should
"have patience to wait for the appropriate opportunity,
rather than forcing the issue," one said. Another suggested
"commitment to success of the organization, not the feminist
cause." Others want women to eliminate the "feminist chip" on
their shoulders, "traditional female actions," and "any
insecurities."
   Anecdotal evidence suggests that losing the "feminist
chip" isn't easy in the face of stereotypes. Henry Kravis of
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, for instance, provoked loud hisses
with an offhand comment at a Financial Women's Association
meeting in New York in March. Mr. Kravis spoke about his
business of buy-outs, but only after suggesting that his
largely female audience might have been happier hearing from
his wife, fashion designer Carolyn Roehm, about her business.
   Group members are still debating whether his remark was an
ill-fated attempt at self-deprecation, or revealed
deprecating ideas about women. Some also wonder why all five
partners and 14 associates at KKR are men. Mr. Kravis
declined to address either question.
                                                                                                       

   Is It Fair to Tailor
   Perks Just for Women?
                                                                                                       

   THE PROBLEM with talented women in business is keeping
them on board, says Stephen Garrison, chairman of Ward Howell
International, a search firm. But his suggestion to correct
the problem may strike the wrong chord with some: He
recommends that employers "discriminate" in favor of women.
   One brainstorm: a clothing allowance for female execs.
"It's fiction" that men and women have similar expenses for
office work and obligatory social functions, he maintains. "I
wear the same suit four days in a row," he says. A loan of
$400 or so a year could be "paid back" with years on the job,
he suggests.
   Similarly, a "hassle bonus" could be compounded annually
for women between 35 and 45 -- when they're most likely to
leave for family reasons or a competing job. The money could
vest at 45.
   How would men react? "At first a little griping. But it
will go away," he says.
   Mr. Garrison may get as much grief from would-be
beneficiaries. A New York bank executive who attended a
meeting where Mr. Garrison proselytized says the idea would
work only "in a perfect world." No question that women have a
rougher deal, she says, but they won't be credible if they
can't say, "I ran the race, fair and square, with no help."
                                                                                                       

   How a CEO Expresses
   His Devotion to Quality
                                                                                                       

   IN THE ESCALATING war for a quality reputation, it's no
longer enough to appoint a quality team or hire a quality
czar. American Express's chairman and CEO, James D. Robinson
III, had his directors change company bylaws to give him a
third title: Chief Quality Officer.
   Mr. Robinson, who lately has juggled problems with his
troubled Shearson unit and top executive resignations,
announced the change to employees in a holiday greeting card
sent late last year. More publicly, in the company's new
annual report, he signs his name over the title. The bylaws
didn't really have to be changed, says a spokesman, but the
message was important.
   We'll have to wait for the final measure of Mr. Robinson's
vow. In speeches these days, he says he wants "to have
`quality' engraved on my tombstone."

   Two Groups of Scientists Report Gains
   In Laboratory Struggle Against AIDS

   Scientists reported two laboratory advances against AIDS.
   Boston researchers described experiments hinting that a
Miles Inc. drug used in stroke patients might prevent the
brain and nerve damage seen in many AIDS patients. Miles is a
U.S. subsidiary of Bayer AG, the West German drug and
chemical maker.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meantime, British scientists, including a team from F.
Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co., said they had synthesized a series
of chemicals that might stop the reproduction of the AIDS
virus. The feat throws the big Swiss drug maker into a race
with Merck &amp; Co., Upjohn Co., SmithKline Beecham PLC, Abbott
Laboratories and Monsanto Co. to develop a new class of
anti-AIDS drugs known as proteinase inhibitors.
   Reports of both developments appear in this week's issue
of the journal, Science.
   The Boston report focuses on a Miles drug, nimodipine,
sold under the brand name Nimotop. It belongs to a class of
drugs known as calcium channel blockers sold by a number of
drug makers. Unlike most of the other calcium channel
blockers, which are prescribed for heart patients, nimodipine
can permeate into the brain and therefore is used to prevent
brain-damaging artery spasms that afflict patients who have
suffered strokes from ruptured blood vessels.
   A team of neurological researchers at Children's Hospital
described a series of test-tube experiments aimed at finding
out how a protein on the surface of the AIDS virus damages
nerve cells. Such nerve damage is thought to underlie the
dementia that afflicts about two-thirds of AIDS patients.
   In the experiments, using rat nerve cells, they discovered
the virus protein, called gp120, causes the amount of calcium
in the nerve cells to skyrocket to as much as 33 times normal
levels. They suggested this calcium buildup is how the virus
protein damages nerve cells.
   At least some of the excess calcium flowed into the cells
from the outside through a special calcium channel in the
cell membrane. When the nerve cells were first incubated in
nimodipine, which blocks the calcium channel, the virus
protein no longer induced a calcium buildup in the cell,
neurologist Stuart A. Lipton and his colleagues reported.
   The researchers said their theory that the virus-induced
buildup of calcium causes nerve damage in AIDS patients is
unproven. But the experiments suggest further research should
be done aimed at eventually testing nimodipine in AIDS
patients. A spokesman for the Miles Pharmaceutical division
in West Haven, Conn., said the company has offered to fund
some preclinical studies at Children's Hospital but added it
was premature to think about clinical trials.
   The British scientists, led by chemists from Roche
Products Ltd. at Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire reported
synthesizing more than a dozen chemicals that block the
action of an enzyme that the AIDS virus uses to reproduce
itself after it has infected a white blood cell.
   A race to develop inhibitors of the enzyme, called a
proteinase, was touched off two years ago when scientists,
including those at Merck, uncovered the molecular structure
of the enzyme. This enabled chemists to begin designing
molecules that could block the enzyme's action.
   The British researchers said that in the test tube their
new proteinase inhibitors were "of considerably enhanced
potency" and appeared to be less toxic than other reported
inhibitors.

   BUENOS AIRES -- Javier Gonzalez Fraga will take over as
Argentina's Central Bank president a second time during the
nine-month government of President Carlos Menem.
   Mr. Gonzalez Fraga was Mr. Menem's first Central Bank
president after the Peronist Party government was installed
last July. He resigned on Nov. 27, reportedly because the
Economy Ministry rejected his plans to free the exchange rate
and manage foreign currency reserves differently.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the event, Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli was
replaced last December. His successor, Antonio Gonzalez,
freed the exchange rate along with controls on wages and
prices.
   The government recently has built up currency reserves by
buying U.S. dollars in the sort of "dirty float" Mr. Gonzalez
Fraga suggested last year.

   Earth to Owen Lipstein]
   With Earth Day media hype reaching incredible heights, Mr.
Lipstein, owner of Mother Earth News, wants to do the same --
by taking his magazine into the heavens. On Sunday, Earth Day
that is, a recorded version of the magazine will be beamed
into outer space via a satellite transmission from Mount
Everest. A team of climbers will broadcast it from
battery-powered equipment at Everest Base Camp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The sonic message in a bottle is taken from the
March/April issue of Mother Earth News. It contains many
heartfelt messages contributed by the famous and not-so
famous about the world's environment and its present
condition. Alfred Meyer, Mother Earth's editor in chief,
asked an assortment of people to send in messages they would
want blasted into space, supposedly to be received by someone
or something.
   Ann Landers, usually a hopeful sort, was gloomy in her
reading: "Our planet is dying," she lamented. Pope John Paul
II spoke of a "cosmos endowed with its own integrity, its own
internal, dynamic balance." Gonzo journalist Hunter S.
Thompson was simply gonzo: "Yesterday's weirdness is
tomorrow's reason why." Michael Kramer, a third grader in
Stamford, Conn., was more clear thinking: "The rain forest
has plants and animals found nowhere else in the world. . . .
It also helps us breathe."
   Not everyone was so willing to participate. One respected
(but apparently xenophobic) scientist refused the invitation
to send a message. "He said he didn't want to advertise our
presence. Whatever is out there might be hostile," Mr. Meyer
says.
   Cynics might consider this a mere gimmick by a troubled
publisher to grab some cheap publicity. Mr. Lipstein recently
ran into a cash squeeze, with the result that he wasn't
mailing his magazines to subscribers on time. He eventually
had to sell his American Health magazine.
   "It's promotional," Mr. Lipstein concedes, "but it's also
a profound thought." He certainly knows a good thing when he
sees it. The resurging interest in saving the Earth is
"reminiscent of the health and fitness boom eight or nine
years ago," he says, proclaiming, "It's fortuitous that we
have a magazine called Mother Earth News."
   And it's fortuitous that "readers" in faraway galaxies
will get it for free: They really can't complain if it
arrives late.

   Mr. Guccione, best known as the founder and publisher of
Penthouse magazine, has expanded his magazine company in
recent years, by acquiring such titles as Four Wheeler, for
auto enthusiasts, and launching Longevity, a health magazine,
last May.
   Kathy Keeton, president of Omni magazine, said Omni
frequently features stories on computers. She said with the
computer magazines, Omni can "realize some synergy" in
advertising sales and editorial matter.
   "Compute] caters to the home market, and the home-office
market is booming with more than 10 million people who work
at home," said Ms. Keeton. "The magazines have a good
future."
   Compute], a monthly with circulation of 211,794, is in
need of "lots and lots of editorial smarting up." The four
magazines are currently published in Greensboro, N.C., but
Ms. Keeton said she didn't know whether they would stay
there.

   TOKYO -- International cooperation and financial vigilance
must be increased to establish a "minimum standard" to combat
money laundering, a task force convened to study the problem
said.
   The Financial Action Task Force called for rapid, tough
and practical measures to address the problem as a part of
overall international work to stop traffic in drugs.
Recommendations include closer monitoring by financial
institutions of transactions, more stringent laws and more
extensive cooperation by national and international
authorities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But acknowledging both the difficulty of such broad
coordination and some disagreement within its ranks, the task
force said that "political impetus would also be particularly
necessary to crystallize strong coordinated overall
international action" to hinder laundering of profits from
drug trafficking.
   The task force was created at the Paris summit of the
Group of Seven in July 1989 to study the money-laundering
process, the measures already in place to combat money
laundering, and to recommend further action. Fifteen
industrialized nations and the Commission of the European
Communities participated.
   The task force noted that differences among laws and
financial regulations of various nations can be exploited by
drug traffickers. National measures to fight the problem,
then, must be "harmonized" to have greatest impact.
   Most signficantly, laws to protect the secrecy of
financial institutions should be conceived so they don't
interfere with the task force's recommendations, the report
said.
   It stressed, however, that measures to fight money
laundering must not be allowed to inhibit free flow of
capital.

   NEW YORK -- It's enough to drive a company batty.
   Just as Warner Bros. Inc. was poised to open the smash
movie "Batman" in South Korea in June and flood the market
with caped crusader merchandise, its parent company Time
Warner Inc. discovered it had been beaten to the punch.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kukje Corp., a Korean-based company, had already begun
producing and marketing a line of its Pro-Specs sneakers with
what Time Warner labeled an unauthorized Batman figure.
Batman, with his long cape flowing, adorned a Velcro strip,
something that outraged Time Warner unit DC Comics Inc.,
which has owned the copyright to "Batman" for over half a
century.
   It took a prolonged legal battle and the intervention of
the U.S. trade representative's office and the South Korean
government to end the dispute. Time Warner said yesterday
that it reached a settlement under which Kukje agreed not to
use any of the Batman trademarks in the future. It also
agreed to pay 25 million won ($35,612) to Time Warner by
Saturday, which the media giant says it will donate to a
yet-to-be-determined Korean charity. Also, Kukje said it
would cease manufacturing the bootleg Batman sneakers,
although it will be allowed to sell its remaining inventory.
   "What this shows is that even Batman needs and appreciates
the help of the U.S. trade representative," said Timothy A.
Boggs, vice president for public affairs at Time Warner in
Washington.
   Mr. Boggs said Time Warner turned to Carla Hills, the U.S.
trade representative, after efforts to halt Kukje's sneakers
went unheeded.
   The legal actions initiated against Kukje by Time Warner
would make even the Joker lose his smile. They included Time
Warner's request for assistance from the Korean Intellectual
Property Office to "cease the manufacture and sale of the
offending shoe," according to a Time Warner document
outlining the case. The company also enlisted the support of
the U.S. Embassy in Seoul.
   Then, in March, Time Warner filed a criminal complaint in
Seoul against Kukje, alleging a violation of Korea's Unfair
Competition Prevention Act. "The U.S. government has been
interested in protecting U.S. copyrights abroad," said Mr.
Boggs. "They have been willing to go in and pound the table."
   Ms. Hills's office said she was traveling and couldn't be
reached for comment. Sandy Christoff, assistant U.S. trade
representative for Asia and the Pacific, who assisted Ms.
Hills, was also out of the country and couldn't be reached.
Messages left with Kukje's headquarters in Seoul weren't
returned.

   Beware of answered prayers.
   That's what Eastern Airlines' newly named trustee, Martin
R. Shugrue, and the unsecured creditors who fought so hard
for his appointment may be about to learn.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   After a bankruptcy court judge took away control of
Eastern from Texas Air Corp. chairman Frank Lorenzo late
Wednesday night and gave it to them, they now face the
daunting task of trying to revive the ailing carrier.
   "It'll take a minimum of a month, more like a couple of
months, for things to settle down," predicted Joel Zweibel,
attorney for the unsecured creditors' committee, in an
interview yesterday.
   Mr. Shugrue, the surprise appointee who only a year ago
was squeezed out as president of Mr. Lorenzo's Continental
Airlines, is "stepping into a big, complex situation," Mr.
Zweibel conceded.
   Mr. Lorenzo may be gone, but the problems that bested him
and his managers aren't: deep financial losses, a lack of
consumer and travel agent confidence, labor unrest, high fuel
prices.
   And while Mr. Shugrue officially reports to U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland who named him, his
fiduciary responsibility is to the creditors, who essentially
own Eastern now. To them will fall, among other things, the
job of helping draft the company's next reorganization plan.
   Eastern does have some breathing room, according to
creditors' representatives and Eastern insiders alike. Even
as Judge Lifland disclosed Mr. Shugrue's appointment, he also
released $80 million from an escrow account to fund Eastern's
second-quarter operations.
   The promise of that money, and the possibility of calm at
Eastern, could go a long way toward reassuring travelers as
well as travel agents who many consider vital to the
carrier's future.
   "There's no guarantee the company is going to survive,
obviously," said Paul Ruden, a senior vice president of the
American Society of Travel Agents, but "if people are tending
to business and don't have to be in bankruptcy court, they
can let the managers manage."
   Texas Air, which had fought hard to keep Eastern under its
mantle, formally said yesterday that it wouldn't appeal the
judge's order for a trustee. In an interview, Mr. Lorenzo
said: "We'd hoped the Eastern situation would have been
different, there's no kidding about that." But he called the
selection of Mr. Shugrue "reasonable," and said: "We intend
to work and support and help Eastern in every way we can."
   Eastern's labor groups, who had been Mr. Lorenzo's
staunchest enemies and had pleaded for a trustee to run the
airline a year ago, predictably crowed yesterday. "We said
{Mr. Lorenzo} couldn't run an airline, and the court agreed
with us," declared Capt. Henry Duffy, head of the national
chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association. "This is a chance
for Eastern to survive, or at least be put in a position to
be sold. We saw no hope of that under {Mr.} Lorenzo."
   Curiously for Texas Air, aside from being a blow to its
corporate pride, the loss of Eastern may not be entirely bad
news.
   In the interview, Mr. Lorenzo said that with Eastern no
longer under the Texas Air umbrella, the parent doesn't have
to include Eastern on its consolidated balance sheet. He said
he expects that to produce a substantial gain for Texas Air.
Eastern was carried on Texas Air's books at $1.2 billion.
   Texas Air also has been rolling up record losses in recent
years in part because of Eastern's deficits. Texas Air
reported a $718 million loss in 1988 and an $886 million loss
in 1989.
   Texas Air may be able to avoid paying Eastern $280 million
in promised compensation, including $133 million in cash, for
certain transactions between the two before the bankruptcy
filing last year.
   After a six-month investigation, court-appointed examiner
David I. Shapiro last month found that in a dozen
intracompany transactions, it could be argued that Texas Air
underpaid Eastern by as much as $400 million. Texas Air
agreed to settle for the smaller amount, which was to have
been paid on confirmation of a consensual reorganization plan
with the creditors.
   With no reorganization plan forthcoming, the settlement no
longer stands. Mr. Zweibel, the creditors' attorney, said his
group is considering whether to try to renegotiate the $280
million settlement or attempt to extract more money from
Texas Air by suing on each of the controversial transactions.
That, however, would mean extended litigation.
   Mr. Lorenzo said it was premature to comment on the
situation. "We're going to have to see where we go with the
examiner and the trustee," he said.
   Texas Air is still on the hook for part of Eastern's
underfunded pension plans. The Pension Benefit Guarantee
Corp., the federal agency that insures the plans, estimates
the underfunding at $984 million; Texas Air claims the total
is about $400 million. The agency has authority to terminate
the plan and force Texas Air to come up with the money. And
if it were to seek it all at once, it could force Texas Air
and Continental into a Chapter 11 filing.
   But the pension agency isn't likely to insist that Texas
Air pay up right away, because such a demand would increase
the agency's own liabilities. Last week, the agency secured a
commitment from Texas Air that it would fund part of the plan
even if a trustee was named. Yesterday, Mr. Lorenzo and the
pension agency said discussions were continuing on how to
deal with the pensions.
   "We fully intend to work with the PBGC," Mr. Lorenzo said.
Individuals familiar with the situation say it's most likely
the two sides will agree on plan to pay off the pensions over
time.
   Mr. Shugrue met yesterday with representatives of the
creditors' committee and last night flew to Miami, where
Eastern has its headquarters. He is expected to sit in on
Eastern officers' usual meeting today.
   Mr. Zweibel said Mr. Shugrue didn't have a list of
executives he wanted hired to manage Eastern. Clearly,
however, there will be some openings as some senior
executives leave.
   Phil Bakes, Eastern's current president under Texas Air,
declined yesterday to say whether he would stay at the
carrier with Mr. Shugrue at the helm. It's understood,
however, he intends to leave and return in some capacity to
Texas Air where he had been an executive in the past.
Eastern's current general counsel, Barry Simon, also is
expected to return to the parent where he has previously
served.
   Prior to the naming of the trustee Wednesday, Eastern vice
president Jose Smith resigned to accept a job at another
company.

   Venture Firms See Green in Environmental Concerns

   Growth Prospects in Field Expected To
   Top Those in Computers, Electronics

   Venture capitalists, sated on computer chips and disk
drives, are turning to the environment.
   "Environmentally related start-ups are attracting more
venture capital as money moves away from crowded and
less-profitable computer and electronics businesses," says
Harry Healer, managing partner of Venture Capital Fund of New
England.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In recent months, for instance, venture-capital firms say
they have invested in such concerns as Galson Remediation
Corp., a Syracuse, N.Y., company that is selling technology
to clean up dioxins and PCBs, and In-Process Technologies
Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif., provider of industrial-waste
processing systems. Recyclers such as Partek Corp. of
Vancouver, Wash., and disposal companies such as American
Waste Services Inc. of Youngstown, Ohio, also are benefiting.
   Venture-capital firms invested more than $100 million in
such companies during the past two years, according to Oliver
Nicklin, president of First Analysis Corp., a Chicago
investment research firm. Before that, he says, the total of
these types of investments was very small.
   Until 1988, venture capitalists often avoided
environmentally related investments because they "didn't
understand the industry" and lacked the expertise to evaluate
complex regulatory and legal issues surrounding it, contends
Mr. Nicklin. Besides, they were preoccupied with computers
and other fields related to electronics.
   But nowadays, start-ups in environmentally related
products and services have larger growth prospects than most
electronic-technology deals, says Jonathan Flint, a partner
at Burr Egan Deleage &amp; Co., a big Boston venture-capital
firm.
   The demand for new environmental products and services has
increased as regulators have gotten tougher, other industry
observers note. "There's greater urgency over finding ways to
clean up the environment," says Mr. Healer.
   For reasons such as these, Mr. Healer's Venture Capital
Fund and Burr Egan Deleage have invested a total of $3.5
million in Galson Remediation. Galson has a patented
chemical-treatment technology to clean up the dioxins and
PCBs that pollute such sites as Times Beach, Mo., and Love
Canal, N.Y. This technology offers an alternative to
incineration, says Richard Tavelli, president of Galson.
   Unlike incineration, which has created concerns about
emission and other hazards, Galson's method takes place in a
closed reactor. "Our system answers many of the community
concerns about on-site waste incinerators," Mr. Tavelli says.
With hundreds of sites nationwide polluted by dioxins and
PCBs, the clean-up market is huge, he adds.
   Such large markets have been a major selling point for
other companies as well, says Franklin Agardy, chief
executive officer of In-Process. His company is developing a
patented non-thermal system that can take toxic gases from
industrial processes and convert them to nontoxic materials.
Venture-capital firms last October invested $1.9 million in
the company. In-Process, which already has sold a large
system to a Dow Chemical Co. plant in California, says its
market is over half a billion dollars in size. "Even with a
small piece of the market, we could end up as a sizable
company," Mr. Agardy says.
   At the same time, many venture-capital investments in
companies producing computers and other electronic equipment
have turned sour lately. According to Technologic Computer
Letter, an industry newsletter, venture capitalists put only
$1.1 billion into electronic-technology companies in 1989 --
a decline of about 12% from the previous year.
   In a business increasingly dominated by a few big,
well-financed and technically diversified companies, there
are fewer niches offering profitable returns, venture
capitalists complain. And the niches that remain don't
promise the explosive growth that companies such as Apple
Computer Inc., Lotus Development Corp. and Compaq Computer
Corp. experienced.
   But some small investments in environmentally related
companies have paid off handsomely. A total of $600,000 that
Venture Capital Fund of New England invested in Groundwater
Technology Inc., a Norwood, Mass., pollution-control concern,
between 1982 and 1984 had grown to well over $16 million at
the end of 1988. And an estimated $1 million invested by Mr.
Nicklin's venture funds in Tetra Technologies Inc., a
Woodlands, Texas, recycling and waste-treatment concern, now
is valued at about $6.5 million. Tetra went public earlier
this month.
   But the market for environmentally related products and
services goes beyond traditional waste treatment, disposal,
and recycling, venture capitalists say. Plant Resources
Venture Funds, Boston, for example, is an investor in BioTrol
Inc., a Chaska, Minn., company that has developed a microbe
that degrades certain kinds of toxic and hazardous wastes.
Grace Ventures Corp., Cupertino, Calif., last year invested
$1 million in Bio-Care Inc. The Campbell, Calif., concern
uses a benign bacteria to clean drain pipes and grease traps.
And IAI Venture Capital Group, Minneapolis, has invested
$700,000 in Mycogen Corp., a San Diego company that uses
genetic-engineering techniques to produce biologically safe
pesticides.
   Opportunities in these areas will continue to grow,
predicts venture capitalist Yuval Almog of IAI. But
successful commercialization will depend on the level of
environmental awareness world-wide, not just in the U.S., he
says.
   Indeed, U.S. entrepreneurs are basing their growth on
international demand. As environmental concerns heighten in
European and Asian countries, "we are hoping we'll be the
first with some of the solutions they need," says Galson's
Mr. Tavelli.
   Still, some venture capitalists are cautious about
investing in environmentally related ventures. Investors must
be particularly cautious about legal liability, especially
when investing in companies that directly handle waste, warns
venture capitalist Matthew Mackowski of Robertson Stephens &amp;
Co., San Francisco.
   Moreover, he points out, demand for products and services
in this area still depends on the vagaries of government
regulation. Federal funds for cleaning up the environment
were allocated as far back as 1986, he notes, but they never
generated new businesses because the laws weren't vigorously
enforced.

   Lots of Stories, Some Formal, Others Feverish

   The 15 stories in Susan Dodd's new collection, "Hell-Bent
Men and Their Cities" (Viking, 240 pages, $17.95),
demonstrate her accomplishment and versatility, while
providing the reader with the diverse kinds of satisfaction
that come from simple realism on the one hand and ironic
self-consciousness on the other. Author of two previous
novels ("No Earthly Notion" and "Mamaw") and one story
collection ("Old Wives' Tales"), Ms. Dodd tackles a
considerable range of styles and subjects without seeming to
strain for effect.
   Ms. Dodd's themes include Jewish-Gentile relationships,
the inevitable changes wrought by illness and old age, the
strains that weaken the bonds of family life, and the good
old mysterious power of love. In the title story, love
seduces a happily countrified woman from the peace and quiet
of her upstate life back to the hectic pace of the city. In
another story, "I'm Right Over There," love is a sedate and
scarcely spoken but no less strongly felt force in the life
of an older man who longs to comfort the unhappy young woman
next door.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You can feel things . . . without having to act on them,"
he reflects. "Maybe that's even an advantage to getting old.
. . . If you're married to a woman like Fran and you're of
sound mind, you don't jump the fence. But you can love other
women. You should, too. You should love anyone you've got it
in you to love, the way I see it."
   This low-keyed naturalism is very different from the
stylized irony of a story such as "Isometropia," in which a
mysterious voice speaking on behalf of his wife and his
mistress addresses the man who is object of their rivalry:
"And when your breathing becomes deep and even, when we've
got you where we want you, we dream of each other, dreams so
vivacious that you grow pale, extraneous."
   A few of the stories fall flat: some because they are
overly sentimental, others because they are too cool or too
contrived. But in most, the blend of sweetness and skepticism
is just about right.
   In contrast to Ms. Dodd's wide interests and settings, the
narrower range of regional fiction helps some writers achieve
focus, even though it also can become a limitation. Beverly
Coyle's engaging first novel, "The Kneeling Bus" (Ticknor &amp;
Fields, 184 pages, $18.95), is a self-evidently
autobiographical account of growing up the daughter of a
Methodist minister in rural Florida in the 1950s.
   Although Ms. Coyle knows how to capture the innocent
charms of childhood and a vanished, backwoods world in which
direct long-distance dialing is the latest thing, she does
not rely exclusively on country-style naivete for her comic
effects. Right from the start, she lets us know she is
dealing with something a little more complex: "There were no
religious pictures on the walls . . . my mother would not
hear of it. . . . my father was a liberal with advanced
degrees who'd smoked cigarettes in the Navy. And I was taken
to New York the summer I turned nine, where I saw Patty
McCormack burn up her red shoes in `The Bad Seed.'"
   The novel is composed of eight chapters, each one a
self-contained story, but arranged chronologically to achieve
a cumulative effect. Although not all the stories are equally
strong, the book does manage on the whole to succeed as a
novel. The characters -- who might so easily have been
portrayed as stereotyped lovable oddballs -- emerge as mildly
eccentric, entirely believable human beings. Nothing
genuinely bizarre or shocking ever happens in their world,
yet their lives are filled with the unexpected.
   There seems to be an inexhaustible supply of Southern
humor in contemporary fiction. Lee Smith's "Me and My Baby
View the Eclipse" (Putnam, 206 pages, $18.95) is a fair
sample of this regional vein. The nine stories in this
collection are less distinctive, more "generic" than those in
"The Kneeling Bus," but they still are full of the down-home
flavor of a culture in which the fervor of old-time religion
gets mixed up with the fever of sexual repression -- and
expression.
   It's a world of trusting, likable girls who "save
themselves" for marriage to their high school sweethearts:
("Cheryl had been so religious in high school, plus they all
wore panty girdles in those days," we're told of one). These
girls grow up to be easygoing, goodhearted wives and mothers
whose husbands walk out on them and the kids move in with
exotic, "liberated" types who live in apartment courts and
don't shave their legs. And even when it's the wife and
mother who does the cheating, you can't help liking her, as
in the case of Sharon, the large, pretty, "slow-moving"
heroine of the title story, who has an unlikely love affair
with Raymond, the goofily flamboyant, vaguely "artistic" son
of the town pharmacist.
   There's plenty of warmth, humor, absurdity and pathos in
these stories, although they share a tendency to become a
little too relentlessly perky and droll. A poverty-program
volunteer in town during the 1960s is described as someone
who "used to climb the mountains for fun, which nobody around
here has ever done. Or maybe he was just ahead of his time.
Now we have all this ecology and physical fitness but nobody
had it then."

   Gillette's Net Rose
   12% in 1st Period;
   Payout Is Lifted

   BOSTON, Mass. -- Gillette Co., citing strong sales of its
new Sensor razor and its international businesses, reported
healthy sales and earnings gains for the first quarter and
boosted its dividend 12.5%
   The shaving and personal-care products company said net
income rose 12% to $87 million from $77.6 million in the 1989
first quarter on an 11% sales increase, to $1.05 billion from
$941 million. Per-share net income available to common
stockholders dropped 6% to 75 cents a share from 80 cents,
however, because of a $14.2 million preferred stock dividend.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Gillette also announced at its annual meeting that it is
increasing its quarterly dividend to 27 cents a share from 24
cents, payable June 5 to stock of record May 1.
   Gillette said its North Atlantic shaving group posted a 9%
increase in sales but a 9% decline in operating profit
because of the costs of the Sensor introduction. However,
that profit decline was more than offset by improvements
elsewhere; in Europe, for example, sales were up 26% and
profits rose 9%, the company's Braun electric shaver and
small appliance business posted a 15% increase in profits on
a 19% sales increase and its Oral B dental care business had
a 72% increase in profits on a 33% sales increase.
   Sensor got off to an unexpectedly fast start and the
company is having a difficult time producing enough of the
product to meet demand; the company is speeding up the
installation of equipment to increase production capacity.
Gillette said it already has shipped nine million Sensor
razors since its introduction, a level that it didn't expect
to reach until October.
   John W. Symons, executive vice president in charge of the
North Atlantic shaving group, said that Sensor is helping
Gillette achieve its goal of winning over some customers who
traditionally use lower-priced, less profitable disposable
razors. Early surveys indicate that 74% of Sensor buyers had
used other Gillette products, and 26% used competitors'
products, he noted. Of that 26%, about half used disposable
razors made by other companies.
   Mr. Symons noted that the tight supply of Sensor blade
cartridges "is easing now and will get considerably better in
May and June."
   Largely because of Sensor, disposable razors' share of the
wet shaving market declined to 41.6% in the January-February
period from 42.7% in November and December, Gillette noted.
While that is a small shift, Gillette considers it
significant because disposables have steadily increased their
share of the U.S. market ever since being introduced in the
1970s. "It is a possibility, in fact now a probability" that
the long-term trend toward disposables can be reversed, Mr.
Symons maintained.
   One issue that has made executives a bit "anxious" is that
Sensor users seem to be getting more shaves per blade
cartridge than they did with other Gillette razors, he said.
But whether this is a result of changed shaving patterns or
the shortage of Sensor blades isn't clear yet, he indicated.

   Nissan Motor Co. has begun construction on a new vehicle
assembly plant in Mexico that is part of a $1 billion
expansion in that country.
   A U.S. spokesman for the Japanese auto maker said Nissan
is building the new plant in the state of Aguascalientes,
where it already has a plant that assembles engines and
transaxles and produces some stamped parts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He said capacity for the new assembly plant will be about
100,000 vehicles a year. That would double Nissan's vehicle
assembly capability in Mexico; the auto maker already builds
about 100,000 pickup trucks and Sentra subcompact cars a year
at an assembly plant near Mexico City.
   The U.S. spokesman said Nissan hasn't decided yet what
vehicles it will build at the Aguascalientes plant, which
should be completed by the end of 1993. It also hasn't
decided where, other than in Mexico, it will sell the
vehicles it builds there. About 20,000 of the cars and trucks
built at the plant near Mexico City are exported to Central
America and South America; the rest are sold in Mexico.
   A report yesterday from Japan quoted a company spokesman
there as saying the majority of the Aguascalientes vehicles
would be sold in Mexico, although a substantial amount will
be exported to Japan, Latin America and North America.
   Nissan expects to hire about 2,000 workers initially for
the Aguascalientes plant; the cost of training these workers
is included in the $1 billion investment figure.
   The investment also includes expanding the Aguascalientes
engine, transaxle and stamped parts plant. The U.S. spokesman
said he didn't have details on the expansion, but Nissan will
hire an additional 1,000 workers for the engine plant.
   The moves come as Nissan is expanding capacity in the U.S.
The auto maker already builds pickups and Sentras at a plant
in Smyrna, Tenn. By 1992, capacity at Smyrna will have been
boosted to 440,000 vehicles a year. Nissan's total investment
at Smyrna, which includes an engine-making operation, will
grow to $1.2 billion by 1992.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A film script about a private eye who
joins a former football star to solve a murder sold for a
record $1.75 million.
   "The Last Boy Scout" could have fetched $2 million, but
28-year-old screenwriter Shane Black said he preferred to
sign with the David Geffen Co., an independent producer he
worked with previously.

<TEXT>
   Recently, it's become almost routine to ask $1 million for
prized screenplays. But industry executives said Tuesday's
sale price far exceeded previous highs.
   A bidding war has broken out during the past year for
"spec scripts," screenplays written without having been
commissioned by a producer or studio.
   The boom, fed in part by an expansion push by Twentieth
Century Fox, Walt Disney Co. and Columbia Pictures, ended the
$300,000 benchmark price for top scripts a year ago.
   Some studio executives say script auctioning has become
too costly. "To get $1 million, it used to have to be a
damned good script. Now, you practically pay that for the
idea alone and wind up with a lot of rewrites," said David
Hoberman, head of Disney's Touchstone unit.
   Others like the change. "I don't know of anything that
generates the excitement of the chase after a big script,"
said John Goldwyn, executive vice president of world-wide
production at MGM/UA Communications Co.
   Screenwriters increasingly are auctioning their work as
studios turn away from the development process, in which
writers are paid to write and rewrite ideas discussed in
advance.

   The consumer products and insurance company said lower
exchange rates for foreign currencies, especially the British
pound, cut revenue by $116 million and net income by $6
million. Earnings were also adversely affected by the absence
of Southland Life, an insurance company sold in March 1989.
   Operating profit from American Brands' core tobacco
business rose 8% to $281 million on record revenue, driven by
strong unit sales and expanding profit overseas. Unit sales
in the U.S. dropped 9%, but price increases helped boost
profit 3%. The company makes such cigarette brands as
Carlton, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.
   The company, based in Old Greenwich, Conn., said interest
expense dropped 31%, as strong cash flow allowed the company
to reduce borrowing.
   American Brands' U.S. tobacco volume was weaker than the
industry trend, said Marc Cohen, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein &amp; Co., but the company as a whole had an
above-average quarter.
   At UST, the U.S.'s leading marketer of moist, smokeless
tobacco, earnings jumped 20% to $52.6 million, or 46 cents a
share, from $44 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales grew 11% to $175.3 million from $157.6 million.
   Domestic unit volume of the Greenwich, Conn., company's
smokeless tobacco products, including the Copenhagen and
Skoal brands, rose 6.6%. "That's definitely above the
industry trend," said Rebecca Barfield, an analyst with First
Boston Corp.
   UST's earnings included a pretax gain of $3 million, or
two cents a share, from the early termination of a licensing
accord for the distribution of pipe tobacco.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
American Brands closed at $64.75, off $1.50, and UST closed
at $26.875, down $1.125.

   SEC, Seeking Hostile Takeover of CFTC's Power
   To Regulate Financial Markets, Is Favored to Win

   WASHINGTON -- After years of watching hostile takeovers,
the Securities and Exchange Commission is attempting one of
its own.
   Led by a politically savvy, well-connected chairman, the
agency is favored to succeed, a move that would usher in a
new age in how the financial markets are regulated.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The takeover target is the politically vulnerable
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or at least its
fastest-growing operation, regulation of the
financial-futures markets. And the voters in this contest
aren't shareholders, but members of Congress.
   "I really think the pressure is for doing something," says
Slade Gorton (R., Wash.), a member of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, which oversees the CFTC.
   Like many corporations preyed upon by raiders, the
woebegone Commodity Futures Trading Com- mission is casting
about for the right defensive strategy to pursue. "All of
this is proceeding very rapidly," laments CFTC member Fowler
West.
   Indeed, the CFTC suddenly finds itself with far less
support on Capitol Hill than it has had in the past. While
the CFTC tries to stand tough, its erstwhile backers in
Congress -- and their campaign contributors in the Chicago
futures markets -- are privately discussing compromise
solutions that could result in switching much of the CFTC's
jurisdiction to the SEC. That's a drastic turnabout from just
two years ago, when a proposal to transfer financial-futures
regulation to the SEC was fiercely opposed by the Chicago
markets.
   Now the positions are reversed: With the Chicago exchanges
weakened by scandal, the CFTC looks ripe for a takeover. And
the SEC holds a far stronger hand than it did in the past.
   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden argues that jurisdiction over
the two markets needs to be unified in order to crack down on
fraud and to have the U.S. speak with a stronger regulatory
voice internationally. Most importantly, he has the backing
of Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and his right-hand man,
Robert Glauber. "We don't need more regulation,"
Undersecretary Glauber told senators recently. "But we do
need to move toward more unified regulation."
   The Bush administration's backing was the signal for which
many in Congress were waiting. "I don't think we can
underestimate the power of Brady in forging ahead with a
merger," says Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the
House finance subcommittee, and a longtime critic of the
split between regulation of the stock markets by the SEC and
the regulation of stock futures by the CFTC.
   Much more than in the past, Congress seems ready to move.
After years of steadfastly blocking change, members of the
two agriculture committees, which oversee the futures
markets, suddenly are trying to meet the SEC halfway. That's
partly because they are worried about being blamed for
another crash in the markets, and partly because they are
beginning to believe that a change in jurisdiction is
inevitable, and they want to cut the best deal possible.
   Sen. Gorton is proposing to shift oversight of financial
futures to the SEC from CFTC, leaving the futures regulator
to oversee the trading of traditional commodities, such as
wheat, soybeans, and pork bellies. On the House side, Reps.
Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) and Dennis Eckart (D., Ohio) have
gone a step further, offering to merge the two agencies into
an overarching superagency. Securities committees in both
houses have started holding hearings on the issue.
   Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, who has been silent on the issue, this
week asked Treasury Secretary Brady to submit proposals by
May 4. While the Michigan Democrat didn't offer an opinion in
his letter, he has in the past likened stock-index futures to
"cockroaches." A Treasury official said the administration
will respond with a proposal "built around the option of
moving index futures over to the SEC. This is a problem that
won't go away until it gets resolved."
   Still, hostile takeovers are never done deals until
completed, and this isn't any exception. Congress can be
exceedingly slow to move, and the futures markets have yet to
fire all their shots. "The futures industry folks are a lot
more organized than the securities side," says Bradley Belt,
a Republican aide to the Senate Banking Committee.
   Adds SEC member Mary Schapiro: "It may not go anywhere
this year. If nothing happens this year, I don't know what
kind of momentum there will be next year. If you're changing
the status quo you need a lot of momentum."
   But backers of the SEC's bid claim that momentum is with
them. They point to last October's stock-market plunge, which
showed investors and regulators that the historic October
1987 crash wasn't an isolated incident. Even usually stoic
Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, told senators last
month that he was "shaken" by the second drop. Moreover, last
year the two largest exchanges regulated by the CFTC were
rocked by 48 indictments stemming from an undercover federal
investigation of widespread trading fraud. That led CFTC
critics to wonder just what the watchdog was watching.
   Additional pressure is coming from Wall Street, where the
securities industry is in the throes of a depression.
Investment in stocks has dwindled in recent years, and
volatility allegedly caused by the futures markets is
increasingly being blamed.
   The dispute sounds technical, but a lot rides on it. It
centers on commodity products called stock-index futures.
Used mostly by institutional investors to control risk, index
futures allow investors to bet on the direction of a group of
stocks without buying or selling the actual shares. Index
futures correlate directly to stocks traded in New York, but
are traded on the Chicago futures exchanges.
   What makes them controversial is that they are used in
program trading-strategies that use computers to trade a
blizzard of stocks and futures. Program trading has been
blamed for accelerating both stock-market crashes. Because
the cost of buying a basket of stocks through futures is
cheaper than through stocks, critics of futures contend that
the products create unusual gyrations in the stock market.
   That argument infuriates CFTC Chairwoman Wendy Gramm, who
contends that economic studies never have proved a link
between futures and volatility. Moreover, she believes that
removing index futures from the CFTC's purview would deeply
weaken an agency that would still be charged with overseeing
agricultural products. (Her views are echoed by her husband,
GOP Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who sits on the Senate Banking
Committee, which oversees the SEC.)
   "No problems have been identified that would be fixed by
shifting jurisdiction," Mrs. Gramm argues.
   Still, compromise talks are under way, though not between
the two agencies, where the relationship is cooling. The
discussions on Capitol Hill focus on raising the cost of
buying the futures contracts, bringing those costs closer to
where they are in the stock market. Other, more technical
changes also are being offered to the SEC's backers.
   But many on Capitol Hill don't see the issue dissolving
even if a compromise is reached. "When the opportunity
presents itself, there are individuals who want to take
advantage of it from a political standpoint," says Rep. Glenn
English, head of the House subcommittee that oversees the
CFTC. "The reasons may change from time to time but it's the
same old tune.
   "This," the Oklahoma Democrat concludes, "is simply a
question of turf, simply power."

   PITTSBURGH -- Allegheny International Inc. and Japonica
Partners, a New York investor group trying to take over the
company, accused each other in court of the same thing
yesterday: vote buying.
   Although charges flew, neither emerged as a clear winner
in the battle to lead the maker of Sunbeam and Oster
appliances out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny's reorganization plan calls for the majority of
its creditors to be paid in stock, while Japonica's plan to
buy Allegheny for $655 million would reimburse creditors in
cash.
   Allegheny said Japonica bought enough bank claims in
recent weeks to make it the company's largest creditor and
then used its position to vote against the company's plan.
Allegheny attorneys argued yesterday that Japonica wasn't
acting in good faith as a creditor but only to scuttle the
company plan and further its own.
   The company said, for example, that Japonica began
acquiring bank claims only after it decided to propose its
own plan and that it paid a premium to get the claims
critical to give it a blocking position.
   In an interesting twist, Japonica said that Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., which tried to buy
Allegheny three times in the last two years, has returned and
is now involved in buying bank claims. Japonica produced a
letter from DLJ to Allegheny's secured banks saying that DLJ
"clients" were interested in buying their claims outright as
long as enough were sold to create a blocking stake.
   Japonica charged that DLJ is tied to Allegheny management,
and that the DLJ acquired stake would be used to vote against
the Japonica plan. Japonica said that Allegheny tapped James
D. Milligan to head its new management team and that Mr.
Milligan worked closely with DLJ. In fact, he was DLJ's
choice for Allegheny's chief executive officer when DLJ was
courting the company.
   Meanwhile, the company's banks and unsecured creditors
strongly urged the court to nullify Japonica's vote against
the company plan. They argued that Japonica, by blocking the
company plan to further its own, is trying to hold them
hostage to the Japonica plan.

   In your March 22 article "Conflict Issues Cloud Financial
Planning," the role of "due diligence" is omitted. The most
crucial question a potential investor should be asking any
financial planner is, "Who performed the due diligence on the
product that is being recommended, and what were that
person's qualifications to do so?"
   Before committing to any investment, one should
"diligently" inquire as to the background, credentials, track
record, integrity, etc. of the syndicator, and not entirely
rely on one's investment adviser's recommendation until the
answers to these kinds of questions are answered
satisfactorily.

   Regarding Thomas Sowell's March 6 editorial-page article,
"Affirmative Action: From Bad to Worse," I have heard
numerous arguments about the ills and dangers of enforced
affirmative-action programs, but I think this statistical
tripe takes the cake. Mr. Sowell is attempting to justify
discrimination with global mirrors.
   The fact that minority/majority over- or
under-representation exists world-wide is not the real issue.
The implication that such occurrences are the result of
natural and random forces is totally inaccurate. Each of the
situations discussed arose from a set of conditions peculiar
to that environment, and great care must be taken before
extrapolating and imposing generalized conclusions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The real issue is whether, in a white-dominated,
multiracial society, there will be equal opportunity for all.
Affirmative-action programs were not an arbitrary act: They
were a response to overt practices of discrimination and
resistance to change. They attempted to not just correct an
"imbalance" (as Mr. Sowell states), they attempted to correct
a continuing injustice. It is because of these efforts, and
the dedicated involvement of colorblind people, that women
and minorities have made a quantum leap forward.
   It is indeed unfortunate that enforced affirmative action
has taken place. But Mr. Sowell would have us believe that
these tools of social justice and economic parity are "a
danger to American society as a whole." He cloaks his
arguments in terms of reverse discrimination,
corporate-compliance costs, social upheaval, etc., but the
hidden dictum is quite clear. And it must be resisted.

   The fact that Jews in pre-World War II Europe were
clustered in certain professions did not occur randomly. Jews
were forbidden from entering trade guilds since the Middle
Ages. They found their niche in finance and lending because
the church proscribed against the practice of usury and
encouraged the Jews to take on what was considered unholy
work. Therefore it was an example of discrimination and a
poor choice for Mr. Sowell's article.
   Susan Richman, M.D.

   ---
   Mr. Sowell's clever reasoning that majorities and
minorities around the world have been "over-represented and
under-represented" in institutions and occupations is
unrelated to the issue of affirmative action in the U.S. He
attempts to discredit, by examples, the affirmative-action
policies -- in government, industry and academia -- with his
claim that "the body-count approach is a danger to American
society." The greatest danger is the continued concentration
of wealth in the hands of Caucasians to the exclusion of
descendants of slaves. This country cannot compete
successfully with other nations if it does not recognize the
entrepreneurial skills of all its citizens.
   Mr. Sowell also claims that the U.S. will be polarized if
the country pursues affirmative-action policies. He has an
unusual talent for collecting useless information to support
his arguments about polarization. For more than 400 years,
the U.S. has been polarized by the racist policies of
American elitists who tried to annihilate the Indians at the
same time they were enslaving the Africans.
   Phillip Rhodes
   Detroit
   ---
   The assumption behind affirmative-action policies is not,
as Mr. Sowell states, " . . . that different racial and
ethnic groups would be evenly or randomly represented in
institutions and occupations, in the absence of
discrimination." Rather, the assumption is that when
employment opportunities are unequally distributed in a
society characterized by historical patterns of institutional
racism, sexism, age and classism, it is not unreasonable to
assume that when a qualified minority person's attempts to
take advantage of "equal" access to employment opportunities
have been denied, that this is a result of discriminatory
practices.
   Accused employers are not asked to "prove" their
"innocence." Why not place the issue into the appropriate
legal context? A plaintiff is presenting "evidence" to
demonstrate harm, and the defendent has the responsibility to
provide "evidence" for aggrieved employers to address this
outcome.
   Sounds fair to me.

   OSHA Seeks to Fine Phillips Petroleum
   $5.7 Million Over Texas Plant Explosions

   The Labor Department moved to fine Phillips Petroleum Co.
$5.7 million, accusing the company of willful safety
violations in connection with the explosions at a chemical
plant near Houston in October.
   Phillips said it would contest many of the citations. "We
really take issue with the word `willful' because we don't
think we compromised the safety of our workers," a spokesman
said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The alleged violations are viewed by many as part of an
industry-wide pattern of safety hazards that has led to
numerous explosions and fires at oil and chemical plants in
the past two years. Many experts blame these accidents on
operations at or above practical capacity. Some unions,
consultants and industry executives say companies don't want
to stop production and do needed maintenance, and this, they
say, has compromised safety.
   The department's Occupational Safety and Health
Administration said it has uncovered internal Phillips
documents "that called for corrective action but which were
largely ignored." And in a report on chemical-industry safety
problems that will go to the White House soon, a study
commissioned by the Labor Department will note other
instances of chemical companies that "refused to be
responsive to" internal audit reports that warned of safety
hazards, said Alan McMillan, an OSHA official. Those
instances won't show the same "scope" as the Phillips
documents, however, he said.
   Work on that report has been pushed along by the Phillips
catastrophe.
   The explosions and an accompanying fire killed 23 workers
and injured more than 130 at Phillips's Pasadena, Texas,
petrochemical plant. The $5.7 million fine is the
second-largest the agency has ever proposed against a single
company.
   OSHA also proposed penalties of $730,000 against Fish
Engineering &amp; Construction Inc., a Houston-area contractor on
the chemical plant's site. Fish said it would contest the
citations.
   OSHA accused Phillips of 566 willful violations, involving
failure to protect 566 workers from fire and explosion
dangers, and of other "serious violations." The citations
included failure to prevent the uncontrolled release of
flammable vapors, use of inappropriate valves and inadequate
fire protection. Fish was cited for 181 willful violations,
including failure to protect its workers from fire and
explosion.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said there was "clear
evidence that this explosion was avoidable had recognized
safety procedures been followed." OSHA officials wouldn't
discuss the Phillips documents.
   The fire and explosions, one of America's biggest postwar
industrial accidents, shook downtown Houston a dozen miles
away and resulted in the most fatalities of any accident at
an oil refinery or petrochemical plant in recent years.
   Some industry officials said a vastly reduced work force
and the oil industry's increasing dependence on outside
contractors have contributed to heightened danger at plants.
   Fish has been the almost-exclusive maintenance contractor
at the Pasadena site for about 17 years and has performed a
similar role at other Phillips plants, OSHA said. Four of the
workers killed and 52 of those injured worked for Fish.
   "Phillips is not a renegade," said Richard Leonard,
director of special projects for the Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers Union. "There is very little difference between them
and other companies around the country," he said.
   Glen Williamson, an OSHA deputy regional director, said
yesterday's action "sends a very clear signal that the agency
is going to take a very strong enforcement position." OSHA
has come under fire from safety experts for what they
consider innocuous fines, sometimes only hundreds of dollars,
for violations at many plants, but it has been taking a
stronger tack since Gerard Scannell took over as head of the
agency last year.
   Even so, Rep. Tom Lantos (D., Calif.), chairman of the
House Government Operations Subcommittee on Employment and
Housing, said the Phillips explosion showed "the cop was not
on the beat." He noted that two months before the October
explosions, an accident at the same plant killed one worker
and seriously injured two others, but OSHA didn't do a
complete inspection. The last full sweep was in 1974.
   After hearing news reports of the August incident, OSHA
investigators did show up, ultimately determining that during
routine maintenance, gases escaped to an area where welding
torches touched off a flash fire and explosion. OSHA fined
Phillips $720.
   OSHA said its inspections of Phillips plants in a
four-state region showed 18 deaths and many hospitalizations
prior to October.
   Mr. Scannell said the primary cause of the fire and
explosions in October was the release, during maintenance
work, of four highly flammable process gases from an open
valve between a reactor vessel and a chemical-settling leg.
Most of the gas escaped quickly because of high pressure, and
a huge vapor cloud sped through the plant and exploded when
it came in contact with an ignition source, OSHA said. Other
explosions followed.
   Contrary to Phillips procedures and industry practice,
there was no backup protection against valve failure or
untimely valve opening, OSHA said.
   Phillips's own investigation asserted that the valve
should have been closed but wasn't because of "human error,"
a spokesman said.
   The Phillips explosions seemed to frighten the oil
industry into tightening up its maintenance procedures.
Unlike the situation in 1988 and 1989, when many companies
postponed maintenance and ran their plants full out, this
year they have closed down equipment to perform necessary
housekeeping. Plants are running around 80% to 85% of
capacity, and the number of fires and explosions appears to
have been reduced markedly. But in December, part of a huge
Exxon Corp. refinery in Baton Rouge, La., exploded, killing
two workers.
   Phillips and Fish have 15 days to contest the citations
before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review
Commission.

   LOS ANGELES -- "Rationality" is finally returning to the
high-stakes leveraged buy-out market, says Timothy M.
Pennington III, co-founder of Brentwood Associates.
   After going nearly two years without a buy-out
transaction, the LBO and venture capital firm this week
completed a $143 million management-led buy-out of Mobile
Technology Inc., a closely held provider of diagnostic
imaging equipment to the health-care industry.

   The completion of the deal represents the flip-side to the
woeful tales coming from the big New York buy-out firms. In
many ways, the recent failures of some big junk-bond financed
buy-outs have helped end the drought for Brentwood.
   Like many smaller firms, Brentwood found itself priced out
of the market in the past few years, as easy access to
junk-bond financing allowed companies to command ever higher
purchase prices. "Whereas a transaction might have been good
at five to seven times a company's earnings before income
taxes, we were seeing a lot going for eight-to-10 times, even
one at 14 times," Mr. Pennington says.
   Ironically, when the bidding for Mobile Technology began
last year, the company was too pricey for Brentwood's taste.
"The auction process started with the auctioneer saying,
`Here's the hurdle.' We said we wouldn't jump over it. So we
didn't attend the auction," Mr. Pennington recalls. "There
was a period of time where the company thought they'd go
elsewhere at the higher price. Ultimately, {Mobile
Technology} came back to us."
   In addition to the lower pricing that has come with the
collapse of the junk-bond market, the deals getting done
these days will include more equity and less leverage, Mr.
Pennington says. "The equity requirement had gone down to
just 10% to 12%. Now we're moving to a 15% to 20% equity
requirement," he says.
   The Mobile Technology buy-out includes equity of $23
million, or 16%, of which $20 million was contributed by
Brentwood from a $140 million buy-out fund raised at the end
of 1988. The rest of the purchase price includes $60 million
of senior secured debt and $60 million of subordinated debt.
   Ronald D. Van Horssen, president and chief executive
officer of Mobile Technology, said the buy-out will allow the
company "continued growth," noting that Brentwood's
philosophy is "to grow a company rather than sell assets or
adopt a no-growth strategy to finance the restructuring."
   Mobile Technology had 1989 revenue of about $76 million.
Founded in 1983, the company provides mobile magnetic
resonance imaging services to about 400 hospitals in 35
states. The company has 465 employees.
   Brentwood, with more than $470 million in assets, has
completed buy-outs of Prince Manufacturing Inc., a tennis
racket maker, and Educational Publishing Co., among others.
Brentwood's most recent buy-out was of Tuboscope Corp. in
1988, purchased from Minstar Inc. for about $136 million.
Tuboscope was taken public last month.

   Tokyo Relaxes
   Banking Rules,
   Aiding Citicorp

   TOKYO -- Throwing a bone to U.S. critics, Japan's powerful
Finance Ministry is easing the way for foreign banks to open
branches here -- a move that chiefly benefits Citicorp.
   A ministry official said the relaxation of its rules is
part of a gradual liberalization of financial regulations
here. In effect, though, the ministry is granting a special
exemption to foreign institutions. But Citicorp's Citibank in
particular will benefit, the official said, because it is the
only foreign bank aggressively to have sought to expand its
retail network.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move appears at least partly aimed at appeasing
foreign critics, especially in the U.S. Congress. The
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Michigan Sen.
Donald W. Riegle Jr., has said that he favors retaliation
against Japanese financial firms operating in the U.S. unless
U.S. banks have equal access to Japan's market. Japanese
banks are the biggest bloc of foreign financial institutions
in the U.S.
   But international appeasement by Tokyo may backfire at
home. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., which acts as the chairman
of the Federation of Bankers' Associations in Japan, declined
to comment on the relaxation of rules for foreign banks. An
official at another of Japan's 12 big commercial banks called
the easier terms for Citibank "reverse discrimination,"
though.
   For its part, Citibank, the largest foreign bank in Japan
with nine branches and about 200,000 customers, said it now
plans to expand its Japanese network by about five branches a
year, to a total of about 50. That will give Citibank greater
access to Japan's 400 billion-yen ($2.527 billion) retail
banking industry without forcing the New York-based bank to
pay an exorbitant amount to acquire a Japanese retail bank in
order to get in, as Citibank officials had feared they might
have to.
   "Now we can pace ourselves," said Masamoto Yashiro,
Citibank's chief country officer in Japan. "We know what we
are getting into every step of the way."
   Separately, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported yesterday
that Citibank will start dollar-denominated loans next week
using bank deposits as collateral, the first such service
inaugurated in Japan.
   The Finance Ministry's move was largely symbolic. Mr.
Yashiro said he still hasn't received formal word of a change
in the government policy. But he noted that Citibank already
has noticed that its applications for new branches or branch
relocations this year have been approved in only two months,
down from a normal wait of six months a year ago. "This
formalizes our understanding with the {ministry}," Mr.
Yashiro said.
   The rules, which are administrative, not statutory,
prevent banks from opening more than one large new branch or
four neighborhood offices every two years.
   With corporate banking on a long, slow decline in Japan,
banks here have been rushing to expand their retail empires.
At the start of this month, two of the country's major banks,
Mitsui Bank Ltd. and Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd., merged to form
Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd. the world's second-largest bank,
behind Dai-Ichi Kangyo. The new bank has about 700 retail
branches. Even with 50 branches in Japan, Citibank won't be a
serious competitor to the country's big banks -- and most
smaller Japanese banks have niche or regional client bases.
   Foreign banks, which hold about 3% of the Japanese banking
market, specialize in wholesale, or investment, banking
activities, such as money-market and foreign-exchange
trading, loan syndications and other corporate financing.
"That's all we want to do," a spokesman for Chase Manhattan
Bank here said.
   Mr. Yashiro said Citibank will continue to focus on those
businesses, but hopes to expand its retail client base to
include individuals who have international dealings or want
to maintain offshore accounts. It began its retail effort
about four years ago, when it shifted a group of employees
from its sagging corporate banking department to a newly
formed retail operation. Early on, it considered buying Heiwa
Sogo, a financially troubled mutual bank that eventually was
sold to Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
   At the moment, Citibank's retail operation in Japan isn't
profitable, Mr. Yashiro said. But, he added: "We are heavily
investing today so that maybe in 10 years we will become
truly profitable."

   Of U.S. Trade Practices

   BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission, determined
to refute U.S. charges that it is creating a "Fortress
Europe," accused the U.S. of maintaining numerous barriers to
European exports.
   In its annual review of "U.S. trade barriers and unfair
trade practices," the EC listed more than 50 impediments to
trade. Among the sectors singled out by Brussels were public
procurement and banking.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The EC report has been expanded considerably from last
year and includes a wide range of trade practices running
from high U.S. tariffs on footwear to U.S. agricultural
export subsidies. More than a dozen items have been added
since the 1989 report, although commission officials said
only some of these were actually new practices introduced in
the past year.
   They said the longer list reflected the more thorough job
done by EC experts in identifying U.S. trade barriers.
   "We detect a tendency in the U.S. to think that in the
trade game, other countries play unfair while only the U.S.
plays fair . . . this simply isn't true," a commission trade
official said.
   He said the EC report was a response to the U.S. trade
representative's annual report on barriers to foreign trade,
which repeatedly has included EC trade practices. U.S.
officials had no immediate response to the EC document.

   BONN -- The big IG Metall metal workers union rejected an
offer by the employers federation to discuss a further
shortening of the workweek to 35 hours once the competitive
situation in the European Community will allow it.
   The union, which is calling for a cut in the workweek and
a 9% pay increase, said the employers' offer, which also
included some concessions regarding weekend work, represented
"cosmetic changes to a hopelessly obsolete model."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The union's rejection of the employers' new opening
underlined the lack of progress in the difficult 1990 wage
negotiations. IG Metall, which represents more than 2.6
million workers in important sectors of the West German
industry, has said it will stage warning strikes at certain
companies in early May.
   The employers federation said it wanted to set "objective
criteria" that would determine extent and timing of a cut in
working hours after 1993. Union officials said such criteria
would mean indefinite postponement of the shorter workweek.

   Late-afternoon sell programs knocked the wind out an
already weak stock market, and bond prices continued their
decline, albeit at a slower pace.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 20.94 points to
close at 2711.94 in moderate trading. Long-term bond prices
were off moderately, while the dollar was mixed, rising
against the mark but falling against the yen.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said stock prices remain at the mercy of the
declining bond market. As bond prices fall, interest rates
rise, providing an incentive for investors to seek safety in
cash rather than in stocks or bonds. Once bond prices appear
stabilized, the higher rates that many analysts expect are
likely to attract more investors to bonds than to stocks.
   The erosion of bond prices stems from growing concern that
inflation isn't under control and that the Federal Reserve
will have to drive short-term interest rates higher if it
expects to curb rising prices. Compounding the inflation
worries are apparent selling by Japanese investors and the
prospect early next month of a $30 billion Treasury refunding
auction.
   Bond traders said that with little economic news to drive
the market yesterday, selling pressures moderated
considerably. On Wednesday, long-term Treasury bonds plunged
more than a full point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 of
face amount. Nevertheless, traders are bracing for yields on
long-term Treasury bonds to hit the 9% level in coming weeks.
Yesterday the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue
stood at 8.84%.
   Stock prices were moderately weak all of yesterday,
generally tracking bond prices. But computer-assisted sell
programs tied to stock-index arbitrage forced prices even
lower in the final half-hour of trading. Absent the programs,
traders said, the fall in prices that took the Dow
industrials down nearly 33 points Wednesday seemed to have
moderated.
   So far, the downward pressure on stocks has come from the
bond market and not from corporate earnings, which many
analysts expected to be much worse. While some companies'
profits have indeed been disappointing, there have been some
positive surprises.
   In major market action:
                                                                                                       

   Stock prices fell in moderate trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 152.9 million shares. Declining
issues surpassed gainers 968 to 511.
                                                                                                       

   Bond prices were modestly lower. The 30-year Treasury lost
about 1/8 point.
                                                                                                       

   The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the U.S.
currency was quoted at 1.6784 marks and 157.20 yen, compared
with 1.6722 marks and 158.10 yen.

   TOKYO -- Amid growing expectations that world trade with
Eastern Europe could expand significantly, Japanese business
and government leaders have been stepping up their research
efforts in the region.
   The Japan Federation of Employers' Associations said it
will send a 20-member research mission to Eastern Europe in
late September to study economic and labor conditions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The organization's goal is to get an idea of what type of
economic cooperation governments and businesses in Eastern
Europe are most eager to receive from Japanese business, and
what lessons Japanese business-labor practices and
administrative practices might offer, a spokesman said. The
mission will travel to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia
from Sept. 23 to Oct. 4, he said.
   Meanwhile, the Soviet Union-East Europe Office of the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry is heading a
similar mission to Poland and Hungary. The mission of
ministry's Economic Investment Environment Research Group is
to study the conditions for private investment opportunities,
such as infrastructure, an official said.
   The 70 Japanese executives and government officials on the
ministry's mission traveled to Poland last week, and were in
Hungary this week, he said, noting that this mission differs
from that of the employers' federation in focus but still
reflects the same principle of gaining a better understanding
of business and economic conditions in Eastern Europe.
   Though results won't be reported until the group returns,
the leader of the ministry's mission in Poland indicated that
the market there is potentially attractive, as the country
has made progress in curbing inflation and stabilizing its
currency.
   But he said the overhaul of the legal structure to support
a market economy and the development of infrastructure must
be followed closely, a Japanese daily reported.
   In addition, various Japanese cabinet members, including
Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama and Health and Welfare
Minister Yuji Tsushima, plan to visit the region separately
this year.

   MANAMA, Bahrain -- The total assets of Bahrain's offshore
banking units, or OBUs, rose 7% to $72.58 billion at the end
of December from $68.12 billion a year earlier, the Bahrain
Monetary Agency said.
   The assets of the island's OBUs have risen gradually from
a low in 1986, when the sector held total assets of $55.68
billion. After expanding rapidly in the late 1970s and early
1980s, Bahrain's offshore banking sector was hurt by the
effects on regional economies of the sharp drop in oil prices
during the mid-1980s.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Of the December 1989 assets, $29.96 billion, or 41%, were
held in Arab countries last December, and $14.27 billion, or
20%, were held in Western Europe. Only $7.87 billion, or 11%,
were held in North America.
   On the funding side, $45 billion in liabilities, or 62% of
the total, were held in Arab countries. The banks had
liabilities of $12.72 billion, or 18%, with Western Europe,
and $5.75 billion, or 8%, with North America.

   Milken Told to Accept Plea Bargain
   By Noon Today or Face Further Charges

   NEW YORK -- Prosecutors gave Michael R. Milken a deadline
of noon today to accept a plea bargain or face additional
charges, according to people familiar with the plea
negotiations.
   Lawyers for the former chief of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.'s junk-bond operations have spent nearly four months
trying to negotiate an agreement that would enable Mr. Milken
to avoid the new charges and the prospect of a lengthy trial.
Mr. Milken already faces charges on 98 counts related to
insider trading and other alleged securities-law violations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The government is buttressing its deadline by ordering the
federal grand jury that has been investigating Mr. Milken to
convene in Manhattan today, individuals familiar with the
investigation said. If Mr. Milken decides not to accept the
plea agreement, the grand jury could vote on an expanded
indictment this afternoon.
   Any plea agreement would involve a settlement of civil
insider-trading charges brought by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in September 1988, as well as the
criminal charges -- including racketeering, conspiracy and
securities fraud -- handed up by a federal grand jury in
March 1989.
   Under the settlement terms offered by the government, Mr.
Milken would have to plead guilty to six felony counts and
pay more than $650 million in fines and penalties, according
to individuals familiar with the plea discussions. While a
federal judge would decide on the length of Mr. Milken's
prison term, prosecutors would recommend a sentence totaling
five years for all the counts, the individuals said. A
spokesman for Mr. Milken declined to comment.
   Lawyers familiar with the case say Mr. Milken would be
unlikely to receive as attractive a settlement offer once a
new indictment was issued and the government began to prepare
for trial. If convicted of racketeering charges at trial, Mr.
Milken could face up to 20 years in prison.
   While an acceptable plea agreement seemed highly unlikely
as recently as last week, Mr. Milken's legal team, led by
Arthur Liman, a partner at the New York firm of Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, has been negotiating nearly
around the clock since last weekend with officials of the
SEC.
   Among the major sticking points from the standpoint of the
Milken camp was the SEC's insistence that Mr. Milken
cooperate in the government's continuing insider-trading
investigations, individuals familiar with the negotiations
say. The government is understood to have softened the terms
of its cooperation requirement.
   Individuals who spoke with Mr. Milken as recently as late
yesterday said that while some of his attorneys and others
recommended that he accept the negotiated pact, Mr. Milken
had still not made up his mind about whether to do so. They
said Mr. Milken was less concerned about the fines and jail
term than he was about having to cooperate with any further
investigation. In addition, he was said to be worried about
the status of the case against his brother, Lowell Milken,
who was also charged in last year's indictment.
   Although Michael Milken has directed his lawyers to work
out terms of an agreement, individuals who know him well say
they wouldn't be surprised if he rejected the pact at the
last minute. Before last year's indictment, Mr. Milken's
attorneys held a round of negotiations with the government.
But after prosecutors relented on certain positions Mr.
Milken considered key to a settlement, Mr. Milken rejected
the offer in the end, the individuals said.
   The latest government deadline was set by Roger Hayes, the
deputy U.S. attorney in Manhattan who is supervising the
case. Prosecutors last month had told U.S. District Judge
Kimba Wood that a new indictment would be handed up no later
than this week.

   SEC Eases Rule
   For Conducting
   Private Trades

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a
move that could transform the way companies raise capital,
approved rules making it easier to sell and trade
private-placement securities.
   The private-placement market is a rapidly growing
financing arena in which companies forgo many of the
registration requirements of public offerings and sell chunks
of stock or debt directly to insurance companies and other
institutional investors. The market is estimated at $170
billion, and about 35% of all corporate financings last year
were private placements.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But buyers of those private securities couldn't easily
resell them under earlier SEC rules, reducing the liquidity
of the investments and in turn sending many U.S. companies
overseas looking for investors. Moreover, foreign issuers
couldn't easily enter the U.S. market without disclosing more
than they were required to in their home countries.
   The SEC yesterday moved to ease those requirements,
unanimously passing Rule 144a, which commission officials
suggest could open the floodgates to companies seeking to use
the non-public markets. The rule "will enhance the
competitiveness and efficiency of our domestic markets," SEC
Chairman Richard Breeden said. "The result should be a lower
cost of capital."
   The rule would create a "144a market" that would in effect
allow large players to trade among themselves without going
back to the registration and disclosure process. But it will
be closed to all but the biggest investors. Only institutions
that own $100 million or more in securities, estimated to be
thousands of investment houses and corporations, can buy
private placements under the rule.
   In addition, the commission tacked on two new wrinkles to
the proposed rule. Banks and thrifts are forced to leap
another hurdle to play in the market: They must have net
worth of at least $25 million. SEC member Mary Schapiro said
that about 50 savings-and-loans that met the standard $100
million threshold wouldn't qualify under the new guideline.
   But the rules were relaxed for brokerage houses, which
will be able to participate if they own $10 million in
securities.
   To help investment in the products, the SEC is loosening
the rules governing mutual fund investments. Mutual funds
generally can't invest more than 10% of their assets in
so-called restricted, or illiquid, securities such as private
placements. But the SEC said it will allow the funds'
directors to determine whether 144a investments are liquid.
The agency said that more than 1,000 mutual funds will meet
the eligibility standards for the market.
   In tandem with Rule 144a, the SEC also approved
establishment of a trading system called Portal, which was
created by the National Association of Securities Dealers.
Portal will act as an electronic bulletin board to facilitate
the trading of large blocks of debt and stock in the 144a
market.
   The electronic board also has the potential to be adapted
into a trading and pricing system for bonds, Chairman Breeden
said. He asked agency staffers to push the NASD to consider
such a system, especially for the high-yield "junk" bond
market, where price and trading information is often
difficult to find.
   Mr. Breeden also said at the meeting that the agency will
be examining shelf-registration rules to see what changes are
needed to foster capital creation by companies. Shelf
registrations allow companies to register once for a series
of financings.
   The first entrants into the 144a market are expected to be
foreign companies looking to raise money in the U.S. Many
foreign issuers have shied away from the U.S. markets because
of the tougher disclosure rules designed to protect
individual investors.
   By allowing only "sophisticated" large institutions to
play in the market, the SEC felt it didn't need to offer much
protection to the pension funds, mutual funds, insurers,
charitable organizations and others that already have $100
million in securities.
   Stocks or bonds that are traded on any public exchange
won't be allowed in the 144a market, a restriction designed
to keep private securities from spilling over into the public
markets and vice versa.
   Under the new guidelines, U.S. or foreign companies
already registered with the SEC for any kind of security
won't have to disclose anything more. U.S. companies that
haven't registered will have to make financial information
available to holders on request.
   Foreign companies that haven't made a U.S. public offering
in the past but have done so in their own countries need only
provide the same information that they would in their own
countries. If they haven't made an offering in the U.S. or at
home, they will need to make information available according
to the same rules as U.S. companies that haven't registered
in the U.S.
   Not everybody is enthusiastic about the rule change. In a
sharply worded letter to Mr. Breeden, Reps. John Dingell (D.,
Mich.) and Edward Markey (D., Mass.) questioned the legality
of the SEC to move in the area. "We are concerned that Rule
144a may be . . . beyond the scope of the powers of the
commission," they wrote.
   Moreover, Rep. Dingell, the head of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, and Rep. Markey, who runs the panel's
finance subcommittee, expressed concern about "the
development of a two-tiered market for U.S. investors, one
public and one private."
   The two lawmakers said they were concerned about "the
diminished availability of many quality investments to
smaller investors" and that bad investments could be passed
on to individual investors through mutual funds and pension
funds.
   And in an unusually prickly request, Reps. Dingell and
Markey asked the SEC to report to the committee every six
months on a 13-part set of questions about the 144a market.

   MIAMI -- It was among the grandest of plans, conceived in
1983, amid the headiest of booms. The office-vacancy rate was
a comfortable 10%, and the plan -- to build a
700,000-square-foot office building overlooking Biscayne Bay
-- seemed a sure bet.
   So out of the ground rose Barnett Tower, 33 stories of
steel and glass, the handiwork of Lincoln Property Inc., a
Dallas developer, and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. With an
average of 1,000 people moving to Florida every day and Miami
emerging as the business hub of Latin America, a first-class
skyscraper on Brickell Avenue -- Miami's Wall Street --
couldn't lose. Or so its builders thought.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Today, three years after Barnett Tower was completed, it
still sits 40% empty. Around it, in two dozen buildings
lining Brickell, "For Rent" signs hang on an additional one
million square feet of office space despite rental
concessions of 20% off listed rates. In all, nearly a quarter
of the avenue's five million square feet of space lie vacant,
with sharply higher vacancy rates among the seven office
towers built in the past five years.
   "I don't think any prudent developer would have built any
of these buildings had we known then what we know now," says
Darryl Parmenter, a former managing partner of Lincoln who
now owns his own Miami real-estate firm. "We overbuilt."
   The story is the same nearly everywhere in Florida.
Rampant overbuilding, sparked by a booming economy in the
early- and mid-1980s, has produced one of the softest
real-estate markets in the state's history. Need some office
space? Florida has 41 million square feet for rent -- a
three-year supply. Looking for a break on a lease? Developers
from Tampa to Miami, where office vacancy rates in some areas
hover close to 30%, will cut between 20% and 40% from listed
rents. Want to buy a little land in Palm Beach County?
Residential lots that sold for $70,000 in late 1988 now go
begging at $48,000.
   Other states, of course, also are plagued by weak
real-estate markets. But real estate is more than just
another industry in Florida. It's what oil was to Texas: a
seemingly endless source of profit and pleasure for anyone
willing to put up some money. Office parks, and indeed whole
townships, stand as monuments to speculators made rich. Says
Clifton A. Poole Jr., a top federal bank regulator, "There's
just something about (Florida) that says, `Come on, and get a
piece of the action.'" Now, however, the action in Florida --
the nation's third-largest real-estate market, after
California and Texas -- is drying up.
   In recent weeks, moreover, Florida's commercial-property
glut has come back to haunt one of the prime forces behind
its building boom: overzealous lenders. Since mid-March, some
of the state's biggest, most profitable banks, including
Barnett Banks Inc. and Southeast Banking Corp., have
increased their loan-loss reserves, slashed earnings
estimates and seen credit ratings reduced in the wake of
special regulatory examinations. The Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, already stung by banking
disasters in the Southwest and New England, says the
examinations were prompted specifically by concern about
commercial real-estate loans.
   Amid falling real-estate prices and rising worry about a
credit squeeze by wary lenders, developers and lenders across
the state are asking: Where's the bottom? Florida has often
stumbled in the past, most recently in the mid-1970s when
real-estate investment trusts fueled a building boom that
went bust. Since then, a combination of sun, sand and, more
recently, Mickey Mouse has warded off another debacle. But is
this the start of a full-fledged crash? Responses are mixed.
   "We have to be careful not to confuse a minor adjustment
with a major correction," says Malcolm T. Murray, the chief
credit officer of First Union Corp., a Charlotte, N.C.,
bank-holding company with a $6 billion portfolio of loans on
commercial real estate in Florida. "Yes, the commercial
market is soft, but we're not in some kind of free fall."
   Indeed, some economists say Florida's problems aren't as
dire as those in Texas, Arizona and Massachusetts. Donald
Ratajczak, the director of Georgia State University's
Economic Forecasting Center, notes that an expanding
manufacturing base and bustling tourism, anchored by Disney
World, are adding almost 150,000 jobs a year to the state's
tax rolls. "Those kinds of numbers can quell a lot of
concerns," he says.
   What they can't seem to quell, however, are fears among
some developers and bankers that the staggering oversupply of
commercial and residential real estate has left the state
more vulnerable than at any time in the past decade to the
fallout from any nationwide recession. If Northeast and
Midwest "feeder" markets, the source of Florida's population
growth, weaken further, neither sun nor sand nor Mickey may
be able to avert a crash.
   "The problem is likely worse than most people now think,"
says R. Thomas Powers, who directs economic research at
Goodkin Research Corp. in Fort Lauderdale.
   Tampa's glut of commercial property typifies the problems
throughout Florida: The area is awash in office space because
lenders and builders, thinking the market would always bounce
back, continued to lend and build even as the demand for
space began to soften in 1987. Now, many of the financially
weaker buildings have been repossessed and additional
foreclosures are likely because no improvement is expected
for at least another year.
   "We were gorging ourselves on new space in the 1980s,"
says George Bartlett, the first vice president of brokerage
services at Coldwell Banker in Tampa. "Nobody wanted to hear
`the market doesn't need that building now.'"
   In Tampa's Westshore area, near the airport, the total
square footage of office space went from three million in
1982 with a 12% vacancy rate, to six million in 1985 with a
29% vacancy rate, to nine million today with a vacancy rate
of about 21%. With the market's ability to absorb the space
declining sharply in the past five years, construction in
Westshore has ground to a halt despite developers' blueprints
for some eight more office buildings -- nearly two million
square feet -- in the area. The reason for the "de facto"
moratorium: Large rental discounts to lure tenants make most
buildings unprofitable.
   "Nobody will build a building with (today's) concessions
at 20% to 40% off listed rents," says Douglas Rothschild, a
commercial broker in Tampa. Effective annual rents, he says,
are in the $15-to-$17-a-square-foot range in Westshore, but
developers need rents of $18 to $19 to cover their costs.
"None of the buildings built since 1985 have realized what
developers expected," Mr. Rothschild says.
   Consequently, four of the 17 buildings built in Westshore
in the past five years have been repossessed. In 1983, for
example, Patrick Morley paid the highest price ever for
Westshore land -- $32 a square foot, according to Mr.
Rothschild. Mr. Morley, who hasn't returned repeated phone
calls seeking comment, planned a three-building,
750,000-square-foot office complex called Tampa Commons,
midway between downtown Tampa and the airport.
   But by the time the Orlando developer completed the first
of the three buildings two years later, vacancy rates had
soared, and he was forced to offer 30% to 40% concessions off
rents. Because he couldn't cover his loans with the
unexpectedly low revenue, Mellon Bank repossessed the
building, and Freedom Savings &amp; Loan (now run by Resolution
Trust Corp., the federal agency set up to manage failed
thrifts) foreclosed on the remaining land. Building No. 1 of
the project still sits half-empty. Buildings No. 2 and No. 3
were never built. And because the first building was meant to
connect with the other structures through mezzanine walkways,
it has no main entrance on the street. Instead, its entrance
faces a condemned, one-story structure with graffiti on the
plywood covering its doors and windows.
   The land for Buildings No. 2 and No. 3 is now for sale by
Resolution Trust at $22 a square foot, but Mr. Rothschild
says the real value is no more than $17 a square foot. Mr.
Morley "got involved in the overbuilt frenzy of Tampa and hit
the market totally wrong," Mr. Rothschild says. "Everybody
was trying to get into the pot."
   Although concerns about commercial property are paramount,
200 miles to the south and east of Tampa, residential markets
are also being pummeled -- in none other than Palm Beach
County. In the 1980s, the affluent county caught fire when
hordes of Northeasterners in their 40s and 50s moved South
after selling homes and businesses whose values had
skyrocketed. Now, as the Northeast's economy cools off, that
pool of migrants is drying up. And many new Floridians want
to go home.
   "They thought they could come down here and get a
part-time job and live the good life in the sun," says John
Spies, a Florida specialist at a Houston research firm,
American Metro-Study Corp. "It didn't work. A lot of people
overextended themselves to where their standard of living is
not as good as it was up North."
   The statistics are ominous. North Palm Beach County has a
13- to 15-month supply of new single-family houses for sale,
up from a "normal" supply of about nine months, according to
Metro-Study. After a recent sell-off of better homes, the
southern part of the county now has about a 12-month supply,
but "the ones left will be very difficult to sell without
discounts of more than 20%," Mr. Spies says. The county also
has a 28-month supply of vacant lots ready for building, with
an additional 70-month supply plotted for development but
without roadways, sewer and water lines and other utilities
installed.
   Two additional clouds hover over Florida: a possible
credit crunch and the potential sale of billions of dollars
of commercial property by Resolution Trust.
   Publicly, banks deny planning to clamp down on lending.
Indeed, when Barnett Banks announced in March a $60 million
charge to earnings, Charles E. Rice, its chief executive,
said it "will continue to meet the credit needs of its
customers, including . . . real-estate lending."
   Privately, however, some developers and bankers, citing
the increased scrutiny by federal regulators, say the spigot
has already been turned down. "To require more documentation
or collateral is almost like removing another layer of
borrowers," one banker says.
   Meanwhile, failed thrifts have dumped about $5 billion of
commercial property into Resolution Trust. An additional $24
billion worth is likely to be seized in the next three years.
And the agency faces mounting pressure to unload property,
perhaps at fire-sale prices. Such a move, coupled with a
downturn in the national economy, could spell disaster for
Florida.
   "Your gut instinct is to be careful and not use a
broad-brush approach about this situation," says Bert Ely, a
bank consultant in Alexandria, Va. "But with all that supply
out there, if we see a recession in the next six months, or
even a year, all bets are off."

   Challenges Bush
   On Budget Deficit

   WASHINGTON -- The House Budget Committee approved a
deficit-reduction plan that would cut military-spending
authority more and Medicare less than initially proposed by
the House leadership.
   The $1.2 trillion plan, approved on a 21-14 party-line
vote, is a direct challenge to President Bush. It would set
military-spending authority for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 at $283 billion, $24 billion less than the president
requested. It also calls for fewer cuts in nonmilitary
programs than Mr. Bush wants and for a $13.9 billion tax
increase.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Leon Panetta of California, and
other members of the House Democratic leadership initially
had backed a plan that called for $286 billion in
military-spending authority. Liberals complained that the
figure was too high, and yesterday Mr. Panetta proposed the
lower figure, which was approved by the committee.
   Though liberals seemed pleased by the change, conservative
Democrats were uneasy. As many as 40 conservative Democrats
could abandon the budget blueprint when it comes to the floor
in the coming weeks; such defections could jeopardize the
plan's prospects as few Republicans are expected to support
it.
   In addition to the changes in military spending, the panel
altered the Democratic leadership's proposal so that it would
cut less from Medicare. At the request of Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means
Committee, the Medicare cut was set at $1.7 billion, compared
with the leadership's $2.1 billion, aides said. The president
had proposed a $5.2 billion reduction.
   What's more, the panel agreed to add $200 million in new
spending, bringing the total for new initiatives in the
budget blueprint to $6.2 billion. The extra money would go to
child-welfare programs, among other things. Where the extra
money would come from remained largely undefined.
   Budget resolutions lay out a blueprint for spending and
tax legislation by other committees. The current one is
designed to reduce the deficit in fiscal 1991 to $64 billion
from the projected gap of $100.5 billion that would occur
without new legislation.
   But more than half the $36 billion in the hoped-for
deficit reduction is contingent on yet-to-occur negotiations
with the president. The resolution doesn't require the
president's signature, but Democrats made clear it will
require his acquiescence if it is to be put into effect.
   On tax increases, Rep. Rostenkowski is expected to refrain
from offering his own plan. That would bog down the
tax-writing process. The Ways and Means chairman is said to
be considering an attempt to send to the House floor
legislation that would increase the gasoline tax without his
committee's official recommendation.
   The military-spending plan approved by the House panel
would provide for $295 billion in actual outlays during the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, about $8 billion less than the
president requested.
   In the Senate, meanwhile, Armed Services Committee
Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) announced that he also will push
for deeper cuts in military spending than the administration
has proposed for the next few years.
   Breaking months of silence on specific defense-budget
numbers, Sen. Nunn urged removing 200,000 to 225,000 of the
more than 300,000 troops stationed in Europe by the
mid-1990s. Such cuts would be nearly three times larger than
advocated by the administration. Sen. Nunn also wants to save
money by keeping largely support units, rather than
heavy-tank forces and other front-line combat troops, in West
Germany.
   Sen. Nunn singled out the Navy for trying to avoid deep
cuts by balking at mothballing aircraft carriers and turning
over other ships to the reserves. In light of budget
pressures and changes in EastWest relations, the Georgia
lawmaker said, the Navy should be able to operate with 10 or
12 carriers, compared with the current fleet of 14.
   Describing the House Democratic defense number as lower
than he would like but still "within the range of
responsibility," Sen. Nunn said he will unveil his overall
Pentagon-spending blueprint in the next few days.

   Lotus Net Income
   Tripled in Quarter
   On 38% Sales Rise

   Continuing a strong rebound, Lotus Development Corp. said
first-quarter profit more than tripled on a 38% sales gain.
   The big software maker reported net income of $22.8
million, or 53 cents a share, compared with weak year-ago net
of $5.3 million, or 13 cents a share. Sales rose to $165.5
million from $119.9 million.

   Lotus's first-quarter results were at the high end of
analysts' expectations, and its shares closed at $34.375, up
$1.125, in active national over-the-counter trading.
   Lotus is entering a strong new-product cycle and is
expected to show respectable growth this year. But there were
some troubling signs in the mix of product sales disclosed
yesterday that suggest the recent growth rate will be
difficult to sustain.
   Lotus, based in Cambridge, Mass., said sales of its
flagship 1-2-3 product line were strong but that customers
were buying far more copies of the less-expensive version 2.2
than version 3.0, a more powerful product with higher profit
margins. The company had hoped for a roughly even split in
sales between these two products. Instead, 3.0 amounted to
about 24% of total spreadsheet sales while 2.2 accounted for
about 70%, with the rest coming from older versions.
   Revenue from software-license upgrades also fell during
the quarter. "Upgrades are clearly winding down," says David
Readerman of Shearson Lehman Hutton, though he expects them
to continue to boost results during 1990. One surprise was
the strong sales of 1-2-3 versions designed to work in
computer networks, executives said.
   Lotus said international sales were especially strong
during the quarter, particularly in Japan, and accounted for
more than half of total revenue for the first time. But
domestic sales grew just 9%, according to Richard Sherlund of
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., a "puzzling slowdown for which Lotus
had no good explanation," he said.
   Lotus surprised the software industry earlier this month
when it said it would merge with Novell Inc. of Provo, Utah.
Lotus is the largest maker of personal computer spreadsheets,
while Novell is the leader in the software needed to run
networks. Lotus has said that the combination of the two
companies is a good strategic fit because of the increasing
importance of computer networks.
   Robert Schechter, Lotus's chief financial officer, said
the two companies expect to complete a definitive merger
agreement in about three weeks. The agreement is structured
as a straight stock swap, valued at about $1.5 billion.
   The merger agreement, subject to approval by two-thirds of
Novell's shareholders, offers no premium to the Novell
holders. Because of this, there have been suggestions that
Novell's large institutional holders might try to force
better terms for the deal. But analysts were skeptical
yesterday that such a move would succeed.

   DALLAS -- After a disappointing Easter travel weekend,
debt-laden Greyhound Lines Inc. continues its struggle to
expand its service network and attract enough riders to shore
up its strike-battered balance sheet.
   Just before Easter, the unit of GLI Holding Co. added
several hundred new replacement drivers, restored service to
286 locations and offered customers in some cities free
tickets if their buses arrived late. But with violence
continuing to flare up in the strike by 9,300 members of the
Amalgamated Transit Union, Greyhound only attracted about 44%
the number of riders it did for Easter weekend a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I feel that our ridership is very high," said Greyhound
spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale, who said ridership had been
hovering between 50% and 60% of pre-strike levels in the days
immediately preceding the holiday. She attributed the lower
percentage over the Easter weekend itself mainly to the fact
that in 1989, Easter coincided with spring break for many
college students.
   But analysts who follow the closely held company's
publicly traded bonds say Greyhound has yet to maintain the
levels of ridership and revenue that it needs to break even.
"The company has said they need to be at about 70%-plus level
to break even," said Charles Mancuso, senior analyst for
Moody's Investors Service Inc. "The question becomes how long
can they go if they don't achieve that level."
   In a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing,
Greyhound acknowledged that a prolonged strike could
seriously impair its financial future. Since the strike began
March 2, the company has continued to restore scheduled
service and add replacement drivers in the face of strike
violence.
   The company said that, as of last Tuesday, it was running
about 72% of its prestrike schedules with 2,903 drivers --
2,393 of them new hires.
   But even if the company succeeds in spite of the strike,
some analysts say they are concerned about the long-term
impact of negative publicity surrounding the recent violence,
the additional debt taken on because of the strike and the
problems in rejuvenating Greyhound's charter and package
express businesses, both badly battered by the walkout.
   "They seem to be winning the strike," says Leigh Walzer,
an analyst with R.D. Smith and Co. "The question now is how
strong will the company be going forward."

   Short Interest
   On Big Board
   Is About Flat
   ---
   But Amex Posts 6.2% Rise
   In Total to Record High
   In the Month to April 12

   NEW YORK -- Short interest for the month ended April 12
was about flat on the New York Stock Exchange and rose 6.2%
to a record on the American Stock Exchange.
   On the Big Board, Chemical Banking Corp.'s short volume,
which had been inflated by an arbitrage play, plunged as
short sellers covered their positions. The Indianapolis
pharmaceutical concern Eli Lilly &amp; Co. posted the biggest
increase in short volume.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The New York exchange reported that short interest inched
down to 613,933,904 shares at mid-April from 614,559,232
shares at mid-March. On the Amex, short volume rose to
70,931,396 shares from an adjusted 66,776,615 a month
earlier.
   For the year-earlier month, Big Board short volume was
556,831,364 shares, a year-to-year rise of 10.2%. A year ago,
the Amex reported 43,663,617 shares, indicating a 62% climb.
   Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.
   Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.
   Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may
be caused partly by arbitraging. The figures occasionally
include incomplete transactions in restricted stock.
   The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board
short interest ratio rose to 4.19 from last month's 3.94. The
ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange's average
daily trading volume that would be required to convert the
total short interest position.
   Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio has
weakened in value as an indicator because options and other
products can be used to hedge short positions.
   Short volume for the New York parent of Chemical Bank sank
to 2,359,516 shares from 17,257,721 shares. Arbitragers had
been selling Chemical's shares short and then covering their
positions with shares bought at a discount under the
company's dividend-reinvestment plan. Chemical later
tightened the rules of the plan.
   Eli Lilly's short volume grew to 10,270,405 shares from
7,917,352. Uncovered short sales for the bellwether issue
International Business Machines Corp. rose 3.8% to 4,053,955
shares from 3,903,455. Exxon Corp.'s short volume slipped
5.5% to 5,581,248 shares from 5,912,126.
   Leading the Amex short volumes, as it has for some time,
was Texas Air Corp. The airline holding company's short
volume dropped 7.2% to 8,817,325 shares from 9,506,412.
   The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in
which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares
existed as of mid-April or in which the short position had
changed by at least 50,000 shares since mid-March (see tables
-- WSJ April 20, 1990).

   Bond Prices Generally Drift Lower as Slump
   In Market Persists but Delines Aren't as Big

   NEW YORK -- Bond prices generally drifted slightly lower
yesterday as the market's weeklong slump continued.
   But the declines weren't nearly as big as they were
earlier this week. U.S. government bond prices fell about 1/8
point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount. Long-term bonds
yielded about 8.84%, the highest in about a year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Renewed inflation fears and selling by Japanese investors
have jolted the bond markets over the past week. Treasury
bond prices have dropped about 2 1/2 points over the past
five trading days, while yields have risen about 1/4
percentage point. Many analysts expect even higher yields
soon because of the U.S. government's huge borrowing needs
over the next few weeks.
   "I think we're going to see somewhat higher interest
rates," said Brian Fabbri, a managing director at Midland
Montagu Securities Inc. He said a 9% bond yield is likely as
the U.S. government's quarterly financing operation,
scheduled for next month, grows nearer. The Treasury is
expected to issue about $30 billion of new notes and bonds in
May.
   In the corporate market, prices of investment-grade bonds
also fell slightly yesterday, dropping about 1/8 to 1/4
point. Most junk bonds, which are high-yield, high-risk
issues with low credit ratings or no ratings at all, were
little changed. But junk bonds of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc. surged on growing speculation that the publishing
company may be the target of a friendly takeover bid.
   Municipal and mortgage-backed bond prices also fell.
Trading was relatively calm in contrast to the frenetic pace
earlier this week.
   Treasury bond prices began falling early in the day in
response to overseas selling but later edged up slightly.
Prices rallied slightly, late in the day, on news reports
that Federal Reserve officials expect progress in combating
inflation. But even that news did little to ease jitters
about the Treasury's big borrowing needs soon.
   "It looks like the U.S. bond market is in a downward
trend," said Rich Spurgin, director of fixed-income research
at Technical Data Global Markets Group. "We expect yields on
the long bond to reach 9% in the next two weeks with 9.15%
possible shortly thereafter."
   A 9% yield on long-term Treasury bonds "would bring a lot
of investors back into the marketplace," said Wayne Wong, a
managing director of fixed-income management at Marinvest, a
subsidiary of New York's Marine Midland Bank. At this point,
he said, "buyers are waiting to see where the market bottoms
out."
                                                                                                       

   Treasury Securities
                                                                                                       

   While bond yields generally rose yesterday, rates fell on
short-term Treasury bills.
   The Treasury's latest three-month bills were quoted late
in the day at a discount rate of 7.76% bid, or a
bond-equivalent yield of 8%. That compared with Wednesday's
closing discount rate of 7.80% to yield 8.05%.
   In the bond market, the price of the government's
benchmark 30-year bonds declined to 96 10/32 from 96 14/32.
Their yield rose to 8.84% from 8.83%. The last time the key
long bond had a higher closing yield was May 11 of last year,
when it was 9.06%.
   Other long-term Treasury bonds offered even higher yields
than did the benchmark 30-year issue, and traders said some
of these issues were attracting more investors. For example,
bonds due in 2006 were quoted late yesterday at a yield of
about 8.97%, while bonds due in 2019 yielded about 8.90%.
                                                                                                       

   Corporate Issues
                                                                                                       

   While bond prices generally fell, Harcourt Brace junk
bonds moved the other way.
   Prices of some Harcourt Brace bonds jumped three points on
rumors that the company may be taken over in a friendly
transaction. According to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report, the rumored suitor is Toronto-based Thomson Corp.
   Harcourt Brace 13 3/4% senior subordinated debentures due
in 1999 gained 2 3/4 points to close at 77 1/4. The company's
pay-in-kind securities, which pay interest in the form of
additional bonds, rather than cash, were up three points to
41.
   Junk bond dealers said, however, that trading in the
issues was light.
                                                                                                       

   Municipals
                                                                                                       

   Mirroring the moves of U.S. Treasurys, activity in the
municipal market slowed from the brisk pace of selling seen
earlier in the day.
   Municipals were 1/8 to as much as 5/8 point lower in
secondary dealings. Meanwhile prices in the short-term market
were lower, sending yields as much as .15 percentage point
higher, traders said.
   New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was
off 1/8 point at 96 7/8 to 97 1/8 to yield 7.45%, .02
percentage point higher than that quoted late Wednesday.
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                                                                                       

   Mortgage securities, which have fared better than
Treasurys during the recent market losses, came under
pressure amid talk that some big institutional investors were
selling mortgages to purchase Treasurys.
   Active mortgage issues were down 3/32 to 8/32.
   Traders said some investors believe that Treasurys are now
more attractive with yields on key issues nearing 9% and with
mortgage-Treasury yield differentials narrowing to about one
percentage point.
   Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
May delivery ended at 94 5/8, down 8/32.
                                                                                                       

   Foreign Bonds
                                                                                                       

   Japanese bond prices climbed again in reaction to the
yen's rise against the dollar.
   The stronger yen is encouraging more Japanese investors to
move money out of U.S. markets and into Japanese bonds,
traders said. Some also said the yen's strength reduces the
likelihood that the Bank of Japan will raise interest rates
soon.
   Japan's benchmark issue due 1999 rose 0.24 point to 86.33
to yield 7.295% as of the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   In other major markets, West German government bond prices
fell slightly in trading dominated largely by futures market
activity. British government bonds were little changed.
Britain's 11 3/4% bonds due 2003-2007 fell 3/32 point to 96
2/32 to yield 12.3%.

   {Will} corporations like Exxon . . . and the other
capitalists/industrialists of the world . . . begin
dismantling the machines that are heating the Earth? These
men and women control the world. They devour the rain forest;
they manufacture the cars that pump millions of tons of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; they own the coal, gas,
oil and factories of the world.
   To get away from all these wealth-creating "resources"
would be inconceivable, for what would the
capitalists/industrialists do? They have built a megamachine
on the very specifications of a greenhouse Earth. They
educate millions of young students in the wisdom of this
earth-heating, destructive, suicidal system.
   These same earth-heating technocrats have also been
telling the Third World that "development" means to do what
they did: Industrialize everything: force the peasants off
the land and create mechanical cash monocultures; sell trees,
bananas, coffee, vanilla, cacao, oil palm, beef and oil to
the "developed" North and with the money import TVs, luxury
goods like big cars, and machine guns to kill the peasant
guerrillas who cause trouble.

   Employer Sanctions Show Little Success
   Halting Illegal Immigration, Study Says

   LOS ANGELES -- The employer-sanction provisions of the
1986 immigration law have had only a modest effect in
deterring illegal immigration, according to a study by the
Rand Corp. and the Urban Institute.
   The joint report comes amid renewed congressional debate
over whether to repeal or change the sanctions, which impose
civil and criminal penalites on employers who knowingly hire
undocumented workers. In essence, the law requires employers
to police job applicants by obtaining proof of their legal
status.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In their report, the economic and policy research groups
estimated that sanctions have reduced the flow of illegal
immigrants by less than 20%, thus failing to produce the
large declines predicted by some advocates of the law. But if
the intent of the law was to curb any increase in illegal
immigration, the sanctions could be viewed as successful.
   The study also found that sanctions apparently haven't
caused a large decline in the availability of illegal
workers. The researchers analyzed labor market data to
measure wage change in certain occupations that traditionally
employ many undocumented immigrants.
   "Congress may wish to weigh the cost of continuing the
program against its current level of effectiveness," the
researchers said. The study was compiled by economists Keith
W. Crane, Beth H. Asch and authors Joanna Zorn Heilbrunn and
Danielle Cullinane, who analyzed data on border crossings,
U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions, labor markets and other
indicators.
   A congressional review of the sanctions was triggered
March 29 by a General Accounting Office study, which found
the law has caused "widespread discrimination" against legal
job applicants who appear "foreign." A hearing of the Senate
Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs is scheduled
for today in Washington to discuss the issue.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), the subcommittee's
chairman, has introduced legislation to expedite
congressional consideration of any changes or termination of
the sanctions. Many organizations have called for the
sanctions to be repealed, including the American Bar
Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Civil
Rights Commission.
   "Many people saw sanctions as a panacea that would correct
all immigration-related problems," said Mario Moreno of the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund in
Washington, one of the groups lobbying for a repeal. "But
they're not effective, and Congress is forcing immigration
reform on the backs of the Hispanic and Asian communities."
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service contends that
the law has been successful in reducing illegal immigration.
"Have we been able to totally regain control of the border?
No, we haven't," said Duke Austin, an INS spokesman. "But the
law clearly has been effective."
   The INS expects to apprehend about one million persons
along the southern border in fiscal 1990, Mr. Austin said.
That compares with the 1.7 million apprehended in 1986, the
year the law passed.
   Other groups and lawmakers such as Sen. Alan Simpson (R.,
Wyo.), a sponsor of the 1986 law, have argued that sanctions
should not be repealed. Some have suggested that more funding
be allocated to educate employers about the law, particularly
the anti-discrimination provisions.

   Who Lost Gorbachev?

   Alluding to the Russian empire's annexation of unwilling
peoples, Karl Marx was once moved to call Russia "the prison
of nations." While this has never been more true than under
communism, Mikhail Gorbachev was supposed to represent a
repudiation of the impulse.
   He did in fact keep Soviet troops in their barracks as the
Soviet empire collapsed in Eastern Europe. In Beijing just
before Tiananmen Square, he said that were a similar
situation to develop in the Soviet Union, it would be solved
"within the political process, and in the spirit of
glasnost." But this Mr. Gorbachev has been lost, and we now
see him resolving events in Lithuania in the spirit of the
Brezhnev Doctrine.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Apparently Mr. Gorbachev is willing to give up nations the
Soviet Union conquered while it was an ally of the West, but
not those it conquered when it was an ally of Hitler five or
six years earlier. Whatever validity anyone may find in this
distinction, the startling thing is the price he seems
willing to pay to hold Lithuania. To wit, his entire program
of both perestroika and glasnost.
   Those who do business with the Soviet Union should
particularly wonder how an economic embargo fits into
perestroika. Closing down existing pipelines for political
reasons is not going to help the Soviet economy. Can the
Soviets really maximize their production by closing down
refineries?
   Even if tanks do not in the end run through Vilnius, the
Lithuanian crisis is also exposing the limits of glasnost.
Much fuss was made over the newly independent press, but the
major organizations -- Pravda, Izvestia, Soviet television --
have been snapped back into line. They are printing a stream
of coordinated misinformation about Lithuania. According to a
Radio Free Europe analyst, "The campaign appears to be
unprecedented in the era of glasnost, and can only be
compared with Soviet media coverage of the Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968."
   Since the final confrontations with Andrei Sakharov, there
has been a different Gorbachev on the TV screens: irritable,
arrogant, intolerant, cruel. Indeed, he is beleaguered on all
sides. Soviet generals have become vocal and belligerent,
fearing that Lithuanian draft-dodging will set off
anti-militarism nationwide. Last month a group of KGB
officials issued a dramatic appeal for the restoration of
order in society.
   The leadership cannot settle on an economic plan, though
the deadline is past. On Wednesday the leader of the Soviet
trade union federation, representing 140 million workers,
threatened to tank the entire economic project if the state
does not meet his demands, including guaranteed jobs for all
workers.
   The Soviet troops have tried to provoke violence, but the
Lithuanians, who in the past weeks have been conciliatory at
every turn, would have none of it. Even some conservatives
write off the Baltics, but independence is no passing fancy
in Lithuania. There was a guerrilla war against Soviet
occupiers from 1945 to 1952, despite tens of thousands of
deportations. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were more
dissident publications per capita in Lithuania than any other
republic.
   Despite their fears, the Lithuanians will hunker down.
President Vytautus Landsbergis has said bravely that his
people could endure for months. Citizens in the West might
remember that it is possible to hire supply ships, and
Lithuania has ports and things to trade. The nations on the
Baltic Sea seem unwilling to offer practical assistance,
except perhaps Norway.
   Western governments are now limbering up their jawbone
muscles. Typically, the European Community has called for a
committee to prepare a report on the matter. But in general
foreign-policy officers in all governments have been loath to
let Lithuania endanger their own pet projects. Arms
controllers don't want arms control disturbed, trade
negotiators want their talks to continue, and Germany in
particular does not want to endanger the chance of
unification.
   Yet Lithuania is likely to prove a defining event. If Mr.
Gorbachev does not stand for openness and economic
restructuring in the Baltics, then he does not stand for them
at all. Mr. Gorbachev has been primarily concerned with
staying in power, and has surely observed that in every
nation of Eastern Europe, true reform meant the ouster of the
communist leadership. Boris Yeltsin will probably lead a
split in the party. What might Mr. Gorbachev be thinking?
   In Lithuania he is developing a formula -- use troops not
to mob the streets but to occupy key buildings, do not shoot
people indiscriminately but arrest them one by one, do not
move until you have expelled Western correspondents, turn off
energy supplies. If it succeeds in Lithuania it can be
applied elsewhere. In East Germany the Soviets still have
380,000 troops; and even West European nations have put part
of their energy supply at risk by paying for the pipeline
some of us warned against in the early 1980s. Above all,
Lithuania shows that Mr. Gorbachev is not the open, liberal

   Excluding the Disabled

<LP>
   Before Congress passes the sweeping Americans With
Disabilities Act it might consider the unintended
consequences of its most recent efforts to help the disabled.
Amendments to the Fair Housing Law passed in 1988 mandated
that all multifamily housing units built in this country from
now on must be accessible to the handicapped. Several groups
representing the disabled warn that the new rules are so
expensive that many disabled people will be priced out of the
housing market completely.
   Congress didn't worry much about costs or definitions of
"accessibility." Senator Paul Simon put the cost at "pennies
a month," while Senator Tom Harkin assured that the
amendments included only "low-cost or no-cost features." Then
reality hit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development, given the
actual task of implementing the congressional edict, proposed
guidelines in January. These require that every public area
be accessible to the handicapped; that kitchens, bathrooms
and doorways all be designed to handle wheelchairs; and that
hilly sites be regraded and ramped for better access. The
guidelines would add at least four inches to doorways,
increasing the size of apartments by more than 5%. They would
also require that all bathrooms be enlarged. Up to 90% of
hilly housing sites must be regraded and fitted with long
ramps.
   Jack Powell, executive director of the Paralyzed Veterans
of America, says he was shocked by the proposed guidelines.
His group estimates the cost of the HUD rules at $900 million
a year. He has an alternative. This past fall, a coalition of
home builders and 13 disabled groups formed a task force to
draft guidelines for accessibility that both sides could live
with. They said, for example, that one accessible bathroom in
each unit would be enough. HUD instead turned over drafting
of the guidelines to a group of building inspectors.
   Mr. Powell says the HUD proposals would cost twice the
amount of his task force's recommendations -- adding between
$1,300 and $3,700 in costs for each walk-up apartment and
from $3,200 to $4,300 for a high-rise unit. That comes to
typical increases between 2% and 5%. Each $1,000 in costs
adds $10 a month in rent.
   "That rent increase could be as big a barrier to the
handicapped as a two-foot curb," says Michael Rose, a
Maryland builder confined to a wheelchair. "Affordability is
part of accessibility." He notes that the disabled tend to
have lower incomes and are most in need of affordable
housing.
   But HUD officials say they are bound by Congress's vague
command to make housing accessible without taking cost into
account. White House officials say they will review the
economic impact of the HUD regs but make no promises.
Meanwhile, activists for the homeless have been strangely
quiet on these new higher housing costs.
   Congress and President Bush need to do some hard thinking
about what benefits the disabled and what just placates the
extreme activists. Just one provision in the Americans With
Disabilities Act, that buses install lifts and toilets for
the handicapped, will cost at least $200 million -- more than
the entire industry's annual profits. Many unprofitable
routes likely will be dropped.
   Affordability is key to accessibility. The disabled won't
be helped if physical barriers are replaced by the economic
barriers of excessive regulation.

   Unisys Says Its Loss
   Narrowed in Quarter
   To Only $3.1 Million

   BLUE BELL, Pa. -- Unisys Corp. said its first-quarter loss
narrowed sharply to $3.1 million from $78.7 million a year
earlier.
   After allowing for preferred dividends, the loss in the
latest period amounted to 19 cents a share, roughly in line
with expectations. The 1989 first-quarter loss was equal to
66 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue rose 5% to $2.31 billion from $2.20 billion,
slightly above expectations, but analysts remained
noncommittal about the company's prospects.
   Unisys attributed much of the improvement to healthier
gross margins resulting from a scaling down last year that
trimmed the computer maker's work force by about 8,000 jobs.
Full benefits from those steps, which led to a $230-million
charge in the 1989 third quarter, will kick in during the
second half of this year, Unisys said. The company previously
estimated the cutbacks will save it about $500 million
annually.
   "Overall, we believe that we are on track to reach our
1990 goal of reducing debt, restoring sound profitability and
improving cash flow," James Unruh, president and chief
executive, said in a statement. A company spokesman said
Unisys, which has been criticized by analysts as too highly
leveraged, reduced its debt by between $50 million and $100
million during the period.
   Unisys said its international results were strong, but
that domestic business, long a disappointing performer,
"remains weak." The company has been buffeted by a price war
and strong competition in the U.S. mainframe computer market,
and analysts said its troubles in that area are likely to
continue.
   Unisys said its strongest gains were in networking
products, software, services, and computers using the Unix
operating system.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Unisys closed at $14.625, unchanged.

   Losing Cold War
   Over Warming

<LP>
   Washington talk fests typically aren't worth much, but
this week's White House gab on global warming was a
revelation. Not that I now know any more about the earth's
temperature. But I sure know a lot more about the politics.
   This isn't meant to be cynical. Politics is healthy and on
the environment more political skepticism is desperately,
achingly needed. Environmental debates are cast as morality
plays, black hats versus white, polluters against those with
a social conscience. But they also have as much to do with
interests as intentions. On global warming as much as on
trade or taxes, it helps to peer behind the moral posturing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   For example, I had no idea how easy it is to cover one of
these green conferences. Environmentalists do the work for
you. The White House may have planned this meeting of 18
nations to fulfill a George Bush campaign promise. But the
enviros turned out to be the better politicians.
   "Have you seen the White House talking points yet?" asked
the cordial and intense Rafe Pomerance of the World Resources
Institute, a green hothouse. I had to admit I hadn't. "You've
got to get those talking points. They really lay out the
whole White House strategy."
   So Dan Becker, Rafe's pal at the Sierra Club, pulled the
talking points from his bag. Among the White House's shocking
orders to its troops: "Don't let reporters position this
conference as an attempt to delay serious decisions on this
issue." In other words, the White House practices media spin
control. Now, there's a scoop.
   The irony is especially rich because the spin control that
really worked was by the enviros. After President Bush gave a
Tuesday speech about the scientific and economic
"uncertainty" of global warming, the greens lined up outside
to say the U.S. wasn't doing enough.
   Mr. Pomerance ("The Europeans are leading . . . ") for 30
seconds, then the Sierra Club's Mr. Becker ("a smokescreen"),
followed by the Natural Resources Defense Council ("an
embarrassment") and the Union of Concerned Scientists ("one
problem is free-market ideology"). Seriatim sound-bites.
   Most networks and papers led with this critique, not with
Mr. Bush's message. It doesn't take a cynic to understand how
much this publicity will help Sierra Club fund-raising.
   Some Europeans -- Germany, France the Dutch -- are also
big warming mavens. They want the U.S., the biggest producer
of greenhouse gases, to impose taxes or remake cars and
toasters to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by the
year 2000. But it's probably no accident that the Dutch only
emit 1% of the world's carbon gases. Or that the French have
huge reserves of clean nuclear power (spurned by our own
greens). Or that Germany could get a 20% reduction just by
cleaning up East Germany.
   One senior White House aide, a green himself, points out
that the politics of global warming is a world version of our
own Clean Air Act. The Europeans are trying to do to the U.S.
what Sen. Robert Byrd of coal-mining West Virginia did to
Midwest utilities: Stick the other guy with the bill. The
U.S., more reliant on coal and full of car-happy
suburbanites, would have to sacrifice much more. Meanwhile,
the Eurocrats would still get green credit back home.
   The Japanese also don't seem to mind if the U.S. redesigns
its cars to spill less carbon dioxide, especially if they can
sell us the cleaner cars. But please don't mention methane,
probably an even more pernicious greenhouse gas. "You cannot
abolish rice paddies" is the way one witty Japanese delegate
put it.
   Of course those pesky carbon-guzzlers in the developing
world also have an agenda, though almost no one noticed. On
Tuesday, the Polish delegate gave a splendid speech about the
importance of free markets to a clean environment. But the
press corps had already left to listen to the enviros and
West Europeans.
   The man from Zaire (per capita income: some $170 a year)
pointed out that about 80% of his nation's energy comes from
wood. Residents of Kinshasa are not clamoring for the Dutch
"carbon tax" (a levy on fossil-fuels), though they will
accept nuclear plants if Americans want to donate them.
   If all this sounds amusing, brace yourself because it's
just the beginning. The world's diplomats know a good thing
when they see it, and they're planning green conferences as
far ahead as the calender permits. Al Gore, the Tennessee
senator and warming maven, is even having his own
"Interparliamentary Conference on the Global Environment"
next month -- a sure sign that the politics is hot. Who
knows, maybe Mr. Gore's group will even debate the substance
of global warming.
   Ah, yes, the substance: As far as this layman can tell,
everyone agrees the earth has gotten slightly warmer in the
last 100 years. But most of this was before 1930, when
greenhouse gases couldn't have been the cause. The scientific
models also say that enough carbon gas is already in the air
to make us warmer, yet satellite data from the last 10 years
show almost no warming at all. No one seems to know what to
expect. Greater cloud cover may make the world hotter, or
maybe cooler. Ditto for the oceans. And even if the earth
does warm by two or three degrees, the impact may be
tolerable. Shorelines could flood, but Canada could bloom.
   Tepid stuff, shorn of the political hype. Which may be why
at a conference supposedly devoted to global warming, the
weather so rarely came up. At one point I asked a White House
official whether he thought global warming was occurring.
"You know, I just don't know," he said. "But we both know
that's not the point."

   Vienna Stocks May Be Out of Step
   After Their Wild Waltz Upward

   VIENNA -- The tiny Austrian stock market is zooming ahead
so fast that investors are starting to wonder if it's about
to ski off a cliff.
   The Vienna Stock Exchange index roared ahead 111% in 1989,
far outpacing major stock markets. So far this year it has
climbed 37%, as investors envision great benefits for Austria
from the political upheaval in Eastern Europe.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Not only do the Austrians expect a reopening of historic
trading ties with Hungary and Czechoslovakia, they also look
for German reunification to boost demand for Austrian goods.
(West Germany already accounts for 35% of Austria's exports.)
   The political glow has boosted Austrian stocks to levels
that investors are starting to view as precarious. Austrian
stocks were down 2% yesterday.
   "We are very cautious about new investments in Austria,"
says Robert Hoyos, director of funds management for Erste
Allgemeine, Austria's largest insurance company. "Stocks are
very highly valued -- one might say overvalued."
   Any major disappointment about East European prospects
could "halve the value" of the Vienna market, the executive
warns. Three factors have bolstered Austria's market.
Austria's economy is small but healthy. Last year's stock
price run-up was fueled by optimism linked to the European
Community's 1992 economic union; Austria has applied for
membership to the EC, and is generally expected to be
admitted by the mid-1990s.
   But what has really made the Austrian market a
trend-bucker this year is the East European connection. Says
Ruben Eingaertner, head of German and Austrian equity sales
at Salomon Brothers Inc. in London: "The Austrian economy has
the same kind of advantages as West Germany, without the cost
of making a major acquisition -- East Germany."
   Such optimism caused investors, mainly foreign, to pile
into a market that is one of the world's smallest and had
been sound asleep for most of the 1980s. (Between 1980 and
1988, Vienna increased only 40% in price, compared with a
world average of 370%.)
   Since the beginning of 1989, four funds have been formed
for Austrian investments, including Alliance Capital
Management's Austria Fund Inc., listed on the New York Stock
Exchange. At least three others are being planned.
   Austria Fund, launched last September with a secondary
offering last February, has $130 million in assets, of which
$30 million represents investment appreciation, estimates
Joseph C. Williams, an Alliance Capital vice president and
the fund's London-based adviser.
   Mr. Williams says that after brief market slumps last
October and November, the Vienna scene was "every portfolio
manager's dream: you buy into a falling market and then see
prices zoom."
   But even Mr. Williams seems cautious nowadays. Austria
Fund currently is trading at a 15% discount to its $16.15 net
asset value -- it closed on the Big Board yesterday at
$13.75. Mr. Williams acknowledges that it is "a fair theory"
that investors are worried that Austrian stock prices are too
high, and that a sell-off in such a thin market could sharply
accelerate any drop.
   Even the market's staunchest supporters say it's so thin
that at times it seems anorexic. Trading on and off the
exchange is controlled by Austria's major banks, and any
trades on the exchange by law must be made through a bank.
Since the exchange is open only between 11 a.m. and 1:30
p.m., about 80% of trades are done off the exchange, mainly
between banks and customers, who use the exchange's prices as
a guide.
   Even if the exchange's hours were longer (it is thinking
about adding another half an hour, as it did last September),
it's doubtful whether its market share would leap. Exchange
brokers, called intermediaries, set stock prices based on the
banks' order flow, and arrange trades. But since brokers'
commissions are keyed to share prices, it's to a broker's
advantage to mark up prices when a "buy" order is coming,
concedes Ulrich Kamp, deputy secretary general of the
exchange.
   "If we had 50,000 shares to buy, we'd never, never dare
tell the stock exchange -- they'd run the price up," says
Salomon Brothers' Mr. Eingaertner. "Instead, we'd buy the
shares from the issuing company or from a bank" off the
exchange.
   Off-board trading also can be a delicate matter because,
despite the recent euphoria, there is still only a relatively
small number of players. Says Erste Allgemeine's Mr. Hoyos:
"If you want to sell something, you'd better not ask more
than one bank, because they'll all approach the same
investor."
   Getting into the market has been relatively easy. Getting
out in a down-draft may be quite another thing. "There is a
lack of liquidity," says Mr. Hoyos. "You can't sell out. You
can only sell into this market if it's a strong market," when
prices are rising.
   The Vienna market's new-found success also has shown up
its inexperience; euphoria occasionally sweeps everyone
along. Says Mr. Hoyos: "I've seen cases where a stock has
gone up and the calls and the puts have gone up. I get the
impression that some people have no idea what they're doing."
   No matter. Demand for young traders and sales persons is
brisk at banks. A sales person with one or two years'
experience can make the equivalent of $50,000 a year.
Although that's modest by Wall Street standards, "banks
didn't even have salesmen in their capital-markets
departments two years ago," says Joachim Kuehnert, an
official at Creditanstalt-Bankverein, Austria's largest bank.
   Mr. Kuehnert has high hopes for the future. "Until last
year, Vienna was right at the Iron Curtain," he says. "Today
we are at the center of Europe. And we now have the first
generation of heirs since before World War I. Through the
Depression, World War II and for years after that, people had
no money to leave to their children. In recent years, times
have been better, and we have a generation of venturesome
young people with money."

   In October, Bette Bao Lord received a cassette that a

the transcript, found in Ms. Lord's new book, "Legacies: A

   Once Chinese believed that building a socialist society
gave meaning to their lives. Now Chinese wonder why they were
born. We do not have the means to live life, nor do we even
have something to die for. We merely consume time.
   At least five of our mutual friends are in Qing Cheng
prison, which is currently under the administration of the
martial law forces. The interrogators assigned there are not
from Beijing but have been transferred to the capital from
throughout the country, just as the soldiers were. W--- is in
another prison, which is worse than Qing Cheng, one normally
restricted to hardened criminals, not political offenders. In
this stifling hot weather, sixteen men live in a space of
fourteen square meters. . . .
   Now more and more the bloody and bungled aftermath at the
Square reminds me of what happened in the Cultural
Revolution, when various factions, all claiming to be
supporters of the Chairman, warred among themselves without a
clue to Mao's intentions. I doubt if anyone -- the students
or their leaders; the cadres or Deng or Li or Zhao; the
soldiers or their commanders -- knew what was really going
on. Not before, not during and not after the massacre. The
confusion was total. And what's more, it was continually
being fueled by rumors -- conflicting rumors. Now that
confusion has been transferred to the masses. . . .
   Many party committees that oversee factories, unions and
associations donated membership dues to the demonstrators or
submitted petitions on behalf of their organizations or even
carried banners in the parade. Now the Party must rely on
these same overseers to drum the official line into the
members of these units, and to investigate and rule on the
political reliability of those in their charge. It is a
farce.
   Military officers have been giving speeches on the
Tiananmen Square incident at key work units. Their opening
line? "My division did not fire its guns at the people."
   No one, be he a high cadre or a lowly comrade in the
street, accepts the official version. After two months of
thorough and nonstop indoctrination, the authorities have
succeeded only in making people parrot their lines at
compulsory political meetings, but they have not prevented
them from questioning their own government. Think of the
implications.
   I find this condition -- when one has a self and one has
no self, when one thinks one's thoughts but speaks the
thoughts of others -- unbearable. Was it only last May when
we could say what we thought to those we trusted? Suddenly
Chinese are hypocrites again.
   There is no sense of security here now. Everyone speaks
lies. Everyone is at the mercy of reports. Everyone thinks
his telephone is bugged.
   That is why I find my own behavior puzzling when I talk to
you. Each time I vow to censor myself, each time I forget,
and each time when I hang up, I regret what I have said. Here
am I, someone framed by telephone calls during the Cultural
Revolution, repeating mistakes I paid for dearly. . . .
   Why was it that when you were here I could talk to you so
freely? Because you gave me a sense of security. No one gives
me that sense anymore, not even my dear old friend H----, who
has always been so good to me. Now I am especially afraid of
seeing her. Now we are bound together. What happens if
tomorrow one of us is taken and questioned about the other?
Do we lie or tell the truth? If we tell lies, that can only
compound our insecurity. What if lies told by one indict the
other?
   I am all too familiar with their interrogation methods.
They never ask you direct questions, or charge you with
specific deeds. They merely ask you to write what you did
each day and who was there with you. What can I write without
involving her? And it would be the same for her with respect
to me.
   Mostly I stay home listening to classical music. Modern
music is too disturbing. I am always hoping to lose myself in
another time, but I never succeed. I long for a girl to be
with me, someone who knows nothing about me and has no
interest in any of my concerns. I want to talk to her only
about the trivial things that make up her life. I don't want
to talk about me.
   I want to lose myself in nature, in grass, in mountains.
Last week I went to the Summer Palace at dawn and spent four
hours walking alone in that vast expanse. During that time I
was myself. I did not worry about whether there was a third
eye watching me. I did not worry about whether there was a
third ear listening to me. I did not worry about whether
momentarily someone would grab me for interrogation. . . .
   I hope to receive your calls more often, but as the time
of our separation lengthens and our lives change in opposite
ways, can we still talk as easily and as profoundly as once
we did?
   I wish you good books. I wish your parents excellent
health. I wish your husband happiness in his work. What else
can I wish?
   You are of another world.

   Two major banking companies, Bankers Trust New York Corp.
and BankAmerica Corp., bucked the general industry trend and
reported improving credit quality.
   Bankers Trust posted its second-best quarter as earnings
rose 21% because of strong trading gains and a drop in
nonperforming loans to highly leveraged transactions.

<TEXT>
   BankAmerica, the San Francisco-based parent of the
nation's third-largest bank, posted a slight earnings
increase as problem loans dropped from year-earlier levels.
   Meanwhile, First Fidelity Bancorp, Lawrenceville, N.J.,
reported a 68% decline in earnings as it continued to grapple
with its loan problems.
   And PNC Financial Corp., Pittsburgh, posted a 40% drop in
first-quarter profit, reflecting continued problems in
commercial real estate, particularly in the Northeast.
                                                                                                       

   Bankers Trust
                                                                                                       

   A rising U.S. dollar and bond market during the quarter
enabled Bankers Trust to report trading gains of $151 million
on government bonds, a 29% increase over a year ago, and $121
million on currency trading, more than a twofold increase
from last year.
   The trading gains, which the bank said stemmed chiefly
from trading for clients' accounts, were needed to offset a
sharp drop in corporate finance fees to about $70 million,
roughly the same as in the last year's fourth quarter; the
bank declined to provide the comparable figure for last
year's first quarter. The lull in corporate restructurings
has been caused by last fall's collapse of the high-yield, or
junk, bond market.
   The trading gains were especially encouraging in light of
recent and pending personnel departures. In January, Allen D.
Wheat, head of derivative securities in London, and more than
a dozen of his employees resigned to join CS-First Boston.
   Mr. Wheat was instrumental in developing Bankers Trust's
successful offering of puts on the Tokyo stock market, and
some analysts lowered their estimates of Bankers Trust's
earnings when he left.
   In addition, this summer Jay L. Pomrenze, Bankers Trust's
head of foreign exchange trading, is scheduled to take a
one-year leave of absence to study religion in Israel.
   Bankers Trust also reported that the credit quality of its
highly leveraged transaction portfolio improved sharply
during the quarter. Nonperforming loans on such transactions,
typically leveraged buy-outs, declined since Dec. 31 by 32%,
or $101 million, to $211 million. Net charge-offs of
highly-leveraged loans totaled $24 million. Though the bank
declined to comment, it is believed that Bankers Trust took
additional charge-offs during the period for its remaining
equity and subordinated debt in the ill-fated management
buy-out of Magnet PLC, a U.K. company.
   The quarterly provision for credit losses was $40 million,
offsetting total charge-offs for the period of $39 million.
   Net interest income totaled $227 million, a 4.6% drop from
a year ago.
   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, the stock fell 87.5 cents to close at $35.75.
                                                                                                       

   BankAmerica
                                                                                                       

   BankAmerica said first-quarter net income grew slightly to
$278 million, or $1.23 a share, a robust 1.1% return on total
assets, on an annualized basis, despite the absence of
interest payments by Brazil, a major debtor.
   In the year-earlier period, the bank holding company
earned $275 million, or $1.38 a share, including $46 million
in Brazilian interest payments. Excluding the year-ago
Brazilian payment, BankAmerica's net climbed by 17%.
   The steep drop in 1990 first-quarter pershare income
reflects BankAmerica's efforts to rebuild capital by selling
additional shares to its holders. The number of shares
outstanding in the quarter grew 12% from a year ago, the
company said.
   Despite its performance, BankAmerica's stock continues to
erode from a high of $36.37 posted in September 1989. In
composite Big Board trading, BankAmerica's shares closed at
$27.50, down 37.5 cents.
   Analysts said that despite the decline, BankAmerica stock
has generally outperformed other Top 50 banks during a period
when banking stocks have experienced a widespread downturn.
The banking industry has been battered by lackluster
earnings, a string of unanticipated write-downs on
nonperforming assets and growing loan problems resulting from
regionwide real estate slumps.
   "The biggest banks in the country are only doing so-so,"
said J. Richard Fredericks, a banking analyst for Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco, saying BankAmerica's shares, on
a year-to-date basis, have improved slightly.
   Analysts called BankAmerica's first-quarter results solid
and slightly better than anticipated. The company used a 16%
increase in non-interest income, amounting to $521 million
for the quarter, and a $60 million extraordinary tax credit
to help offset increases in reserves for its third world
debt, and for losses anticipated from a student loan program.
Reserves for Third World loans increased by $137 million, or
54%, while the company added another $28 million in reserves
to cover problem student loans.
   BankAmerica's residential mortgage loans continued to
grow, rising 31% in the quarter, while its consumer loans
increased a brisk 28% in the same period. The growth helped
push up BankAmerica's average assets by $5.9 billion from a
year ago. On the negative side, the company's nonaccrual
assets remain stubbornly high, and increased slightly in the
quarter to more than $4 billion.
   BankAmerica's performance over the past year has been
among the more remarkable turnarounds in the banking
industry. It has boosted its equity and total capital to one
of the strongest levels among big banks -- perhaps
positioning the company as a possible bidder for troubled
First Interstate Bancorp., which has been battered by real
estate troubles in Texas and Arizona.
   As customary, BankAmerica declined to say whether it has
an interest in First Interstate, though officials at a news
briefing said the company clearly is interested in
acquisitions. As reported, BankAmerica plans to greatly
increase its allowable number of shares outstanding, a move
that would give it a potent weapon in an offer for its
downstate rival.
                                                                                                       

   First Fidelity
                                                                                                       

   Securities analysts didn't attach much significance to the
sharp decline in First Fidelity's first-quarter results.
Instead, they are awaiting the completion of an examination
by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency during the second
quarter before concluding the extent of New Jersey's biggest
commercial bank's problems.
   In Big Board trading, the stock closed at $18.625,
unchanged.
   James Rosenberg, a Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst, said
that newly named Chairman Anthony Terracciano "is going to
clean the deck in the second quarter. The only question is
how strong a detergent will he use."
   The quarter's results were depressed by a $47.4 million
increase in the loan-loss provision to $65 million and a $23
million charge for staff reductions. Net charge-offs totaled
$40.9 million, about the same as a year ago. Nonperforming
assets rose 19% to $604.4 million from $507.3 million in the
fourth quarter.
   At March 31, the reserve for loan losses stood at $413
million, or 2.1% of total loans, compared with $388.8
million, or 1.98%, at year's end.
   Analysts were encouraged by two shifts: Expense growth
halted, and net interest income rose 1.8% to $272.8 million.
Non-interest income rose 13% to $84.9 million, largely
because of $9.4 million in venture capital gains and higher
service charges. First fidelity's net interest margin, or the
difference between what it pays and earns on money, also
widened to 4% from 3.95% at year's end.
                                                                                                       

   PNC
                                                                                                       

   PNC's earnings fall-off was expected. But analysts were
surprised at a sizable increase in nonperforming assets,
which increased to $831.6 million from $581.3 million at
year's end.
   "That's higher than what I was looking for, and that's a
disappointment following their fourth quarter," said analyst
Dennis F. Shea of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. In the fourth quarter
of fiscal 1989, PNC added $180 million to its provisions for
bad Third World debt and domestic real estate loans.
   Even though PNC had warned shareholders two weeks ago that
it expected earnings to fall by as much as 40%, common shares
slid $1.25 to close at $34.375 on the Big Board.
   PNC bolstered its provisions for loan-losses to $108.9
million from the year-ago $36.4 million. The move followed a
federal review of a PNC affilate, Cincinnati-based
Bancorporation, which resulted in an increase in that unit's
nonperforming assets.
   With examiners using tougher lending criteria, PNC said it
took the large loan-loss provision to cover itself in case
future reviews of affiliates result in similar increases in
nonperforming assets.
   In a statement, Thomas H. O'Brien, PNC's chairman and
chief executive officer, said, "PNC has historically
maintained a conservative reserve position. We will continue
to monitor the level of our reserves and take whatever action
is necessary to ensure that our reserves remain at
appropriate levels."

   International:
   Gorbachev Increases Pressure on Lithuania
   By Sharply Cutting Natural Gas Supplies

   MOSCOW -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev increased the
economic and political pressure on Lithuania by sharply
reducing deliveries of natural gas to the renegade republic
and offering new concessions to its Baltic neighbor, Latvia.
   Following Wednesday's cutoff of oil, Soviet authorities
slashed deliveries of gas to Lithuania about 80% yesterday,
leaving barely enough flowing to enable people to heat their
homes and cook. The republic's own main source of power, the
Ignalina nuclear power plant, has meanwhile been shut for
"repairs."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lithuanian leaders set up a commission to oversee
rationing, and warned people to expect a "starvation diet."
Government spokesman Ceslovas Jursenas issued an appeal on
the republic's radio urging Lithuanians "to use most
thriftily these resources that we have, in industry, in
agriculture and in everday life." But the republic so far is
showing no sign of backing away from its March 11 declaration
of independence, which sparked the current crisis.
   In the first official statement, read on the main evening
television news, the Kremlin said it imposed the economic
sanctions because Lithuania had failed to give a
"constructive response" to Moscow's demands. Mr. Gorbachev
and Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov said a week ago that an
embargo would be imposed unless Lithuania rescinded laws
passed since the independence declaration that violate the
Soviet Constitution.
   Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman sharply criticized
what he described as "a mounting propaganda campaign" in the
U.S. over developments in Lithuania. The spokesman, Vadim
Perfilyev, said the U.S. reaction, "can no longer be
explained by a natural desire to understand complicated
processes under way in another country." But he stressed he
was talking about media and other reaction, and wasn't
referring to the Bush administration.
   But Mr. Bush and the Western allies continued to avoid
retaliatory sanctions on Moscow over its crackdown in
Lithuania. The president said yesterday that sanctions
wouldn't be imposed without extensive consultations with the
allies.
   His "reluctance," the president said at a news conference
with French President Francois Mitterrand in Florida, "stems
from trying to keep open a dialogue and discussion that
affects many, many countries. And I am talking about arms
control. I am talking about solidifying the democracies in
Eastern Europe. I am talking about a lot of matters where
U.S.-Soviet relations affect a lot of other countries."
   Mr. Bush and the U.S. allies seemed eager to avoid any
action that would affect Soviet cooperation on arms
reduction, a new security arrangement for Eastern Europe, and
German reunification. The first priority, said a military
specialist at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is to
avoid causing new troubles for a beleaguered Mr. Gorbachev.
"There's a surprising degree of consensus on this," the
diplomat said.
   Lithuania's economy is likely to feel the effects of the
embargo very soon. The country's gas supply has been reduced
to 3.5 million cubic meters a day, less than one-quarter of
usual consumption. And Lithuania's big Mazeikiai oil refinery
has already been forced to work at considerably reduced
capacity. The Ministry of Chemical and Oil-Processing
Industry in Moscow said the refinery now has barely enough
stocks to continue functioning for four to five days more.
   Lithuanian officials had contended that a shutdown of the
refinery would punish others by halting supplies of crucial
petroleum products from Mazeikiai to other Baltic states and
some East European nations. But Moscow's State Committee for
Material and Technical Supplies said that neighboring
republics and foreign countries won't be hurt because they
will receive supplies from refineries in Russia, Byelorussia
and the Ukraine that have additional capacity.
   Lithuania's prime minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene, spent
the day in Norway, holding exploratory talks with officials
about receiving other sources of oil. She will also visit
Denmark. So far, however, she appears to have received only a
lukewarm reception.
   As he steps up the economic pressure, Mr. Gorbachev is
also making strenuous new political efforts to persuade its
two Baltic neighbors not to follow Lithuania's lead.
   At a one-hour meeting in the Kremlin yesterday, the Soviet
president surprised Latvian leaders by offering the republic
a "special status" within the U.S.S.R. if it agreed not to
set out on the path of independence. Unlike Lithuania and
Estonia, the republic hasn't yet declared its independence,
although the issue will be discussed when the parliament
meets next month.
   Latvian officials said Mr. Gorbachev didn't give precise
details, but he hinted that the republic could become a type
of special economic zone. He offered to start talks on both
political and economic issues and, for the first time, raised
the important question of the republic's legal status.
   Along with Lithuania and Estonia, Latvia was forcibly
incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940 following a secret
agreement between Hitler and Stalin that the U.S.S.R.
parliament has now deemed illegal. The issue is important for
activists in all three Baltic republics, who say that they
aren't seeking to secede from the U.S.S.R., but merely to
regain the former independence that Moscow illegally took
away.
   Following his meeting with the Latvians, Mr. Gorbachev
also held two hours of talks with Estonian leaders. He again
warned them to rescind "anti-constitutional acts" taken by
the Estonian parliament, which has proclaimed its aim of
independence after an interim period and suspended the
U.S.S.R. Constitution on its territory.
   An Estonian news service quoted the republic's president,
Arnold Ruutel, as saying, "We need calm reasoning" and that
the republic's parliament should decide on what to do next.

   SMOOTH SAILING: Bush rides a huge current of political
popularity.
   A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that
registered voters approve of his job performance, 75% to 15%.
Aides say the lopsided result vindicates the president's
cautious, prudent approach. Fifty-nine percent approve of his
economic performance, his highest rating since September.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Former Reagan aide Thomas Griscom says Bush's popularity,
ironically, may be working against him in some ways. He
blames "the general attitude of the country right now, one of
satisfaction," for the president's inability to generate a
groundswell of support on such issues as the capital gains
tax cut and the child-care bill.
   But Burton Pines of the conservative Heritage Foundation
says the president's many vetoes -- 10 in his first year, the
most since Eisenhower -- are "an exercise of presidential
popularity."
                                                                                                       

   LUCKY OR GOOD? Foreign tests may show which Bush is.
   As world events from Moscow to Pretoria to Managua have
broken his way, approval of his foreign-policy performance
has steadily risen in the Journal/NBC poll. It now stands at
70%, up from 58% seven months ago. Aides feel little pressure
to be more forceful in responding to world events.
   But tougher tests could lie ahead. An eruption in
Lithuania may yet alter public opinion and create pressure
for tougher steps than Bush is prepared to take. Aid for
Panama and Nicaragua is caught in a Capitol Hill morass, much
to Bush's embarrassment. He may also face struggles over
trade benefits to China, military aid to El Salvador and
imposing additional sanctions against South Africa.
                                                                                                       

   CONSUMERS KEEP the economy growing, as other sectors limp.
   Economists who had been fearful that consumers were
retrenching now figure spending is steady enough, when
combined with the improving trade picture, to push economic
growth above 2% in the first quarter. "Consumers have been
doing their part to hold the economy up," says retailing
economist Rosalind Wells. But some weakness persists,
especially in car sales.
   The Journal/NBC poll finds consumers slightly more
optimistic, a hopeful sign for the economy. Only 23% foresee
a recession in the next year. Some 42% expect the economy to
stay about as it is.
   The Blue Chip survey of economists says strong consumer
demand would be the most important favorable factor for
growth in 1991.
                                                                                                       

   ROSTENKOWSKI'S FORMULA for balancing the budget stirs
little enthusiasm, the poll finds. When asked about a package
that would cut defense, freeze most other programs --
including Social Security -- and increase taxes, 68% say they
are opposed; only 27% are in favor.
                                                                                                       

   NO NUKES: By 57% to 36%, voters oppose building more
nuclear power plants, concluding that risks of accident and
radiation leaks outweigh the reduction in air pollution over
coal- and oil-burning plants. Loosening limits on offshore
oil drilling is opposed by 54% and supported by 38%,
according to the poll.
                                                                                                       

   LIP READERS: Some 57% of voters believe Bush should stick
to his no-new-taxes position, according to the Journal/NBC
survey, while 39% think "there are some things for which he
should now support" higher taxes.
                                                                                                       

   FIGHTING DRUGS remains at the top of the national agenda,
the poll found in measuring the intensity of feeling on six
issues that voters consider vital. Crime, the environment and
education also elicit strong feeling; the budget deficit and
reducing health-care costs lag slightly behind.
                                                                                                       

   BUSH FAVORS gentle treatment of Japan in coming trade
decisions.
   He must decide by April 30 whether to designate as unfair
under U.S. trade law Japan's policies inhospitable to U.S.
semiconductors and auto parts. Baker, Brady, Darman and chief
economist Boskin argue that Prime Minister Kaifu has already
gone as far as he can in the recent agreements with the U.S.
Trade representative Hills, a strong backer of tough action
last year, takes a softer tone now.
   But Commerce chief Mosbacher argues for holding Kaifu's
feet to the fire, and the Journal/NBC poll gives him some
support: 52% believe Japan isn't sincere about opening its
markets, 34% think it is. About half say the recent agreement
will make "just some" difference; 34% think it will matter a
great deal or quite a bit, while 11% think it won't matter at
all.
   This week's agreement between the two nations to negotiate
Allied-Signal's trade complaint removes one difficult issue
of contention, at least for now.
                                                                                                       

   MINOR MEMOS: Guess who's coming to dinner: Given the
choice, those surveyed would rather have dinner with Bush
than with Gorbachev, 73% to 19%. . . . Among the
ex-presidents, Reagan and Carter are virtually tied as the
guest of choice, at about a third each; only 14% chose Ford
and 13% Nixon. . . . Of those who say they cast ballots in
1988, only 32% own up to having voted for Dukakis; he
actually got 46% of the popular vote.

   Georgia-Gulf's Recapitalization Plan
   Voted by Holders, Ending Takeover Fight

   ATLANTA -- Georgia Gulf Corp. said its shareholders
overwhelmingly approved its recapitalization plan at a
special meeting, ending the chemical company's protracted and
bitter battle against a takeover by Dallas investor Harold C.
Simmons.
   The company also reported that first-quarter earnings fell
32% to $37.4 million from $55.4 million, largely due to a
drop in prices on its products and resulting lower profit
margins. Per-share earnings dropped 28% to $1.52 from $2.12
based on 24.6 million shares outstanding compared with 26
million a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue in the quarter declined 21% to $251.6 million from
$317.8 million the year earlier.
   Georgia Gulf said that closing on the financing of its
recapitalization, which is the last remaining element of the
plan, is expected near the end of next week. If so, the
company said the plan will become effective next Friday.
   Some 97% of the voting shareholders were in favor of the
recapitalization plan. The company said 67.4% of its total
shareholders were eligible to vote, based on the Feb. 18
record date.
   Under the recapitalization, shareholders will receive $30
in cash, $8.50 principal amount of a new issue of 15% senior
subordinated notes maturing in the year 2000, and one share
of a new issue of common stock. Through yesterday,
shareholders also had the choice, with respect to as much as
30% of their holdings, to receive 5.5 new shares for each
share currently held.
   Georgia Gulf said yesterday that it was still tallying the
final number of shares tendered in that fashion, but noted
that a condition of the plan requiring that at least 1.5
million shares elect that choice had been met.
   The shareholder approval culminates an eight-month fight
by Georgia Gulf to fend off various takeover maneuvers of Mr.
Simmons and Houston-based NL Industries Inc., a specialty
chemical company that he controls.
   J. Landis Martin, president and chief executive officer of
NL and a top Simmons strategist, said the group was pleased
that Georgia Gulf's plan was approved "and we hope it gets
closed quickly." He said the group, which owns 9.6% of
Georgia Gulf, will watch how the market values the new stock
and debt before deciding whether it will hold on to it or
sell.
   Mr. Simmons made several offers that were rebuffed by
Georgia Gulf's board. In January, Georgia Gulf weighed in
with its own recapitalization plan -- but it had to revamp
the plan in March because of uncertainty in the junk-bond
market.
   Mr. Simmons acquiesced earlier this month by allowing his
final $45-a-share, or $1 billion, tender offer, which Georgia
Gulf had rejected, to expire and he embraced the company's
plan.
   Regarding the company's lower earnings, Georgia Gulf said
it was facing a particularly tough comparison in the first
quarter because last year its prices and margins were at
historical highs.
   Jerry R. Satrum, Georgia Gulf's president and chief
operating officer, said that during 1989, especially the
first half, "business conditions were robust and pricing
reflected spot shortgages for most products." He added that
while prices for some products continue to soften, others are
higher, and overall volume is "holding at very good levels."
   John F. Walker, a company spokesman, said that if the
company can sustain its first-quarter performance, "we
certainly have room in terms of servicing the debt. We'd be
very comfortable at these levels."

   Marketing:
   Coca-Cola
   Concocting
   Big Changes

   ATLANTA -- Big changes are bubbling at Coca-Cola USA,
moves that are likely to shake up the company's marketing
efforts and ripple through the soft-drink industry.
   According to soft-drink industry executives familiar with
Coca-Cola Co.'s domestic division, in the past few weeks the
company has:
</LP>
<TEXT>
   -- Chosen Theodore J. Host, president of Boyle-Midway
Household Products Inc., as its senior marketing executive,
filling a two-year vacancy in one of the most coveted
marketing jobs around;
   -- Expanded the consulting role of Sergio Zyman, an
ex-marketing executive at Coke who left under a cloud after
the New Coke fiasco and whose abrasive style won him the
title "the Aya-Cola";
   -- Decided to dim the spotlight on celebrity commercials,
which both Coke and Pepsi have relied on extensively in
recent campaigns.
   The changes, say the sources, don't reflect any massive
problems with Coke's domestic promotions or advertising.
Rather, they signal an attempt to revive some campaigns that
have been slipping into mediocrity.
   The company's latest Diet Coke campaign, for example,
featured little more than a parade of actresses and athletes
who bad-mouthed Pepsi -- not an effort that stacks up against
the company's successful jingles and sentimental ads of the
past.
   The most significant move is the appointment of Mr. Host,
who is expected to join the company early next month.
American Home Products Corp. agreed last month to sell its
Boyle-Midway division for $1.25 billion to Reckitt &amp; Colman
PLC, a London consumer products maker. Boyle-Midway brands
include Woolite, Black Flag and Easy Off. Mr. Host was also
an executive with American Home's food division, which makes
Chef Boyardee, among other things.
   The choice of Mr. Host was a surprise to industry
executives. Mr. Host didn't return repeated phone calls. Coke
would neither confirm nor deny the appointment.
   A Coca-Cola spokesman denied that there has been any
change in the company's plans for celebrity endorsements.
"The use of celebrities is still a viable part of the
marketing mix," he said. And regarding Mr. Zyman's role, the
spokesman said it would be "inappropriate to characterize his
work as more involved."
   The appointment of Mr. Host could be the most significant
in years for Coca-Cola USA. Mr. Host might be groomed to
succeed Ira C. Herbert, the 62-year-old president of
Coca-Cola USA, industry observers believe. But others note
that there is stiff competition for the position on the
inside.
   In the U.S., Mr. Herbert is Mr. Coke. Long before he
assumed the top job at the soft-drink giant's domestic unit
in October 1988, he helped pioneer the first national
television soft-drink commercials and devise memorable
advertising campaigns such as "It's the Real Thing," and "I'd
Like to Buy the World a Coke."
   In some advertising circles, Mr. Herbert is described as
Coke's "keeper of the trademark." The sometimes
quick-tempered executive personally approves every commercial
and ad theme. He has even checked the placement and size of
the Coca-Cola logo on grocery store coupons.
   It isn't clear whether Mr. Host would eventually be
expected to fill both roles, president and senior marketing
executive, as Mr. Herbert has. Some in the industry speculate
that, if Mr. Host succeeds Mr. Herbert as president in a
couple of years, Michael Beindorff, the 38-year-old vice
president and director of marketing planning, could then
become Coke's senior marketing executive.
   Mr. Beindorff has been a shining star at Coke. He is
credited with the unusually aggressive "Move is on" Diet Coke
campaign, begun last year, which for the first time
positioned a diet soda against a sugared one, namely Pepsi.
He also was a force behind the much ballyhooed
three-dimensional TV spot that kicked off the Diet Coke
campaign.
   Although going outside for such a visible, senior post is
unusual for Coke, it is clear the company has been studying
outsiders for some time. About two years ago, Coke courted
Mark Goldston, then the president of Faberge Inc.'s Faberge
U.S.A. division. But Mr. Goldston ended up taking a marketing
job at Reebok International Ltd., a post he has since left.
   Coke was in no hurry to fill the job. Mr. Herbert, a
marketing heavyweight in his own right, hardly needed to be
propped up by a skilled underling. The last person to hold
the position of senior vice president for marketing was John
C. Reid, who moved into a planning post in 1988 following a
corporate reorganization. Mr. Reid has since taken a job with
Atlanta Mayor Maynard H. Jackson.
   Mr. Reid's tenure was fairly smooth compared with the
turbulent regime of his predecessor, Mr. Zyman, who helped
engineer the introduction of New Coke five years ago. When
Mr. Zyman left Coke in 1986, some people believed he was
forced out (although he and Coke then denied it) because his
abrasive style irritated Coca-Cola bottlers. Speculation
lingers that he was in some way a fall guy for New Coke. Mr.
Zyman was one of a small group of Coca-Cola executives
involved with New Coke.
   Still, Mr. Zyman, now a consultant, has done advisory work
for Coke in recent years with Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the
big Coca-Cola bottling unit, and Coke's fountain division,
whose business has been listing lately because of softness in
the fast-food industry. Mr. Zyman has a reputation as a tough
but brilliant marketer. Mr. Zyman didn't return calls.
   Industry executives say Mr. Zyman has been taking a bigger
role in other areas at the company. They say he has been
particularly active with Diet Coke, one of the company's
fastest-growing products, which he helped pioneer in the
early 1980s. He appears to be consulting on the implications
of the 1992 expiration of Monsanto Co.'s patent on aspartame,
a low-calorie sweetener. Diet Coke is one of the biggest
customers for aspartame, which is marketed under the name
NutraSweet. The patent expiration could lead to lower
aspartame costs and higher profit margins for Diet Coke.
   Mr. Zyman, industry executives say, is also helping tinker
with Diet Coke's advertising, the most recent of which has
drawn criticism for using a spate of celebrities: Jerry Hall,
Chris Evert, Phylicia Rashad, Vanna White, and Sugar Ray
Leonard. Last year, Coke and Diet Coke spots featured 27
stars. Pepsi, too, has featured a string of stars over the
years.
   Despite the company's denial, industry executives say the
word has come down from officials high in the Coca-Cola tower
in Atlanta that the star wars are over. Although there
apparently is no all-out ban on celebrity ads, simple
endorsement spots are being discouraged, the industry
executives say. The company is favoring more creative
commercials -- something along the lines of Coke's recent ads
featuring Art Carney as a lovable grandfather.
   That push is likely to draw a counter-response from Pepsi.
Traditionally the two rivals react to changes in each others'
advertising. When Diet Coke ads attacked Pepsi last year --
suggesting that consumers were leaving Pepsi in droves for
Diet Coke-Pepsi fired back, challenging the claim with an ad
that poked fun at Coke's researchers. And whatever maneuvers
the big soda pop companies make, the changes inevitably cause
waves that affect the strategies of the smaller companies as
well.

   Ford Is Likely to Spend a Record Sum
   To Advertise Redesigned Escort, Tracer

   DETROIT -- Even though the redesigned Ford Escort and
Mercury Tracer will be unprofitable from the start, Ford
Motor Co. will likely spend more money advertising the launch
of the subcompacts than it has with any other cars.
   Ford officials said they will at least equal the record
amount they spent to promote the introduction of the Ford
Taurus and Mercury Sable midsized sedans in late 1985 and
1986. The Ford officials declined to reveal the size of the
ad budgets for the 1991 Escort and Tracer, which are
scheduled to start reaching showrooms later this month. But
Advertising Age estimates Escort and Tracer ad spending will
reach $100 million compared with the $90 million spent on the
Taurus and Sable.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Past versions of the Escort have been among the most
popular cars sold in the U.S. But Ford has already conceded
it will lose money on the new versions of the subcompact,
which will have a base price of $7,565.
   Nevertheless, the Escort and its Tracer twin are crucial
to Ford's continued overall profitability. The reason: Under
federal corporate average fuel economy standards, Ford must
sell huge quantities of fuel-efficient cars in order to sell
all of the large cars, which bring big profits.
   "This is the most important launch of a new vehicle in the
history of the company in our belief," John B. Vanderzee,
advertising manager of the auto maker's Ford division said at
a press luncheon yesterday. "It is more important than the
first launch of Escort in 1980, the Mustang {in 1965} and
Taurus in 1986."
   Ford has already invested nearly $2 billion in the
development of the new Escort and its state-of-the-art
production facilities, which can make about 400,000 Escorts a
year.
   Ford also plans to use the Escort, which was last year
upstaged by the Honda Accord as the best-selling car in the
U.S., as a means to attract car buyers who tend to purchase
import vehicles.
   "We believe we have a legitimate contender for import
intenders," said Robert Gillooly, the Ford division's car
advertising manager. "We are going after them in a big way."
   Similar to the launch of the 1986 Taurus, as much as 75%
of the Ford division's car advertising budget will be used to
promote the Escort name for the next five months, Mr.
Gillooly said.
   To reach import car buyers, Mr. Gillooly said Ford is
embarking on its "biggest print program ever" by taking four
to eight-page advertisements in weekly and monthly magazines.
At the same time Ford plans to maintain its strategy of
spending two-thirds of its Escort ad budget on television.
   The theme of the new Escort ads will be: "A new line of
thought. A new line of cars." The television and print
advertisements will show the technological and engineering
process used to design and develop the new Escorts. The new
Escort ads, at least initially, won't dwell on the
subcompact's price, which was a focus of previous Escort
marketing campaigns.
   Neither will the ads mention the role Mazda Motor Corp.,
Ford's Japanese partner, played in the Escort's engineering.
Mazda supplied key parts such as automotive transmissions and
some multivalve engines for the sportier GT versions of the
car. Ford officials said their studies indicate that there is
no added advantage of including Mazda's name in the ads.

   Agrees to Buy

   Dayton Hudson Corp. agreed to buy Marshall Field's for
$1.04 billion, expanding its upscale department store
business with one of the most famous names in retailing.
   The purchase from B.A.T Industries PLC will make Dayton
Hudson the dominant department store retailer in Chicago,
with about a 15% share of the market. Dayton Hudson already
dominates the department store scene in its hometown of
Minneapolis, with its Dayton's stores, and in the Detroit
area with Hudson's stores.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Kenneth A. Macke, Dayton Hudson's chairman and chief
executive officer, described the 24-store Field's chain, with
sales last year of about $1.09 billion, as "a great strategic
fit." After the acquisition, Dayton Hudson will run 61
high-end department stores with annual sales exceeding $2.8
billion.
   News of the acquisition, however, sent Dayton Hudson's
stock down $1.25 to close at $69.50 in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said the move reflected
investors' concerns that Dayton Hudson might be paying too
much and that it faces big risks in consolidating its
department store operations. Buying Field's, they suggested,
also may distract a company bent on expanding its Target
chain of discount stores and its low-end Mervyn's department
stores.
   But Mr. Macke, at a news conference in Chicago, defended
the transaction. "We think we got a value that meets all of
our hurdle rates," he said. He added that Dayton Hudson
intends to invest about $1.5 billion to expand its Target and
Mervyn's chains over the next two years.
   It's unclear, however, whether Philip B. Miller will
remain at the helm of Field's. Mr. Miller, who is widely
credited with turning around Field's since taking over as
chief executive in 1983, led an unsuccessful management bid
for the chain. "I'm disappointed," he said. "They had the
higher bid."
   Mr. Miller said he plans to meet with Dayton Hudson
officials on Monday. "I'm going to listen carefully to what
Dayton Hudson's plans are to assimilate Field's into their
operations," he said, "and I will react accordingly."
   Dayton Hudson President Stephen E. Watson praised Mr.
Miller's performance but said the company hadn't yet decided
whether to ask Mr. Miller to stay.
   Some Field's executives, meanwhile, expressed relief that
Dayton Hudson had outbid May Department Stores Co. and
Dillard Department Stores Inc., which both operate more
moderately priced department stores that cater to
less-affluent customers. "Dayton Hudson is a wonderful
company and I don't think anybody's bummed out by it. We all
just wanted it to be Miller," said one executive, who
requested anonymity.
   The executive explained that Dayton Hudson is "more in
line with the Field's life style in their customer approach,
merchandise mix and the way we run our stores."
   Analysts suggested, in fact, that Dayton Hudson outbid its
rivals because the similarities between its business and
Field's will allow it to more easily consolidate some
operations. These might include credit programs, accounting
functions and even merchandise buying, the analysts said.
   Dayton Hudson's Mr. Watson said the companies might reap
some savings by doing a joint private-label program. "We have
no plans at this point to make any changes, but there have to
be some advantages," he said.
   Still, the purchase price surprised some analysts,
although it was in line with the expectations of B.A.T. The
London-based conglomerate put Field's on the auction block
last year to fend off a takeover bid from Sir James
Goldsmith. "We said very clearly that this was not a fire
sale," said Arthur C. Martinez, senior vice president in
charge of B.A.T's U.S. retail operations. "We had a great
property in Marshall Field's and we expected to get a very
good price. That's exactly what has happened."
   Mr. Martinez added that Dayton Hudson might wind up paying
as much as $1.1 billion, after adjustments for expenditures
for store renovations and other projects that B.A.T will
continue until the closing date. He said he expects the deal,
which is subject to regulatory approval, to be completed in
six weeks.
   Dayton Hudson plans to finance the acquisition with a
combination of new debt and internally generated funds.
Analysts said they expect the company to borrow most of the
purchase price. Mr. Macke said only that he expects the
additional borrowing to push up the company's debt to 68% or
69% of capitalization from its current level of 62%. "We will
have absolutely no problem financing this," he added.
   Mr. Macke also predicted that the acquisition wouldn't
have a "material" effect on earnings in the current fiscal
year. But David Poneman, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;
Co., cut his earnings forecast for the current year to $5.80
a share from $6 to reflect the costs of integrating the
department store operations and possible severance payments
to Field's managers. The acquisition, he said, "enhances
Dayton Hudson's potential growth rate and makes strategic
sense, but at the cost of increasing their financial risk and
their operating risk."
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. also said it is considering
downgrading $2.7 billion of Dayton Hudson's long-term debt.
The rating agency said it is focusing on the company's cash
flow and debt protection as well as industry trends and the
strategic benefits of the acquisition.

   Your Money Matters:
   An Astute Trading Adviser Can Be a Scarce Commodity

   With more than 2,000 trading advisers registered with the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finding a professional
to steer you through the commodity markets shouldn't be any
trouble.
   The problem is finding one with a good chance to make you
money. The most obvious way to select a CTA, simply comparing
recent investment returns, can be a big mistake.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Commodity trading advisers, or "CTAs" as they're known,
spend their days (and sometimes their nights) trying to make
a profit for their clients, buying and selling everything
from soybeans to Japanese yen futures. Investors can hire
CTAs directly, by going through an "introducing broker" who
has established relationships with several CTAs, or by buying
units in a publicly offered commodity fund that employs one
or more CTAs.
   As with most types of investing, the temptation is just to
compare track records. But investors who select CTAs by
looking only at their recent performance are apt to be
disappointed.
   That's the conclusion of an analysis by Richard Oberuc,
president of Burlington Hall Asset Management Inc., a
Hackettstown, N.J., firm that develops software to track
CTAs. Using a data base supplied by Managed Account Reports,
a newsletter that tracks managed futures money, Mr. Oberuc
ranked the performance of 135 active CTAs in 1987 and 1988.
   He found that the top five CTAs had an average compound
annual return of 112% over the period. But 1989 was another
story. Those same five advisers lost an average 4.1%; the top
performer, which turned in a 170% average annual gain in
1987-88, lost 39.9%.
   Instead of focusing on annual returns, many investment
professionals say, investors should zero in on a commonly
accepted measure of risk called the "maximum drawdown."
That's the largest peak-to-valley percentage drop in a CTA's
account value.
   Ken Tropin, chairman of the Managed Futures Trading
Association, says he looks at how frequently bad periods
occur -- and at how deep they are, relative to the good
periods.
   The object is to find a CTA with a high average annual
return, with the lowest possible drawdown. Dividing the
average annual return by the maximum drawdown, is one way to
quantify the reward-to-risk relationship.
   In the table accompanying this article, for example, the
CTA with the highest average annual return in the three years
through last December is Trout Trading Co., with a 62.2%
average gain. Trout, however, had a maximum drawdown of 8.5%.
Dividing the return by the drawdown gives a reward-risk ratio
of 7.3.
   A more cautious choice might be Hickey Financial Services.
While its average annual return of 21.6% was only about a
third of Trout's, its maximum drawdown was only 1.9% --
giving it a reward-risk ratio of 11.4.
   When comparing CTAs, most industry observers say,
short-term track records are all but meaningless. "As a
professional, I think I can judge a CTA with only a
three-year track record, but I believe the general public
should look for a five-year record," says Mr. Tropin.
   Mr. Oberuc of Burlington Hall also recommends looking at
longer periods. "You want to see how a CTA performs in as
many different kinds of markets as possible. If a CTA can
make money in a 1989-type market, that is a good test."
   People in the business say it's critical for investors to
find out how much money a prospective CTA has under
management. A track record produced with $250,000 isn't
meaningful, most professionals say. But having too much can
also be a problem. Some CTAs who can manage small sums come
apart when the amount exceeds $5 million.
   The size effect is attributed to several factors. One is
that as the amount of funds under management gets larger, the
CTA tends to become timid and reduce his position size,
thereby diminishing his return. Also, when managed funds get
very large, it might be impossible for a manager to deploy
them effectively. This occurs because of position limits
imposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that set
a ceiling on the number of contracts that can be held for a
single customer. Very large CTAs might wind up holding assets
mostly in Treasury bills.
   Mr. Tropin says he would look for a CTA that has managed
at least $5 million, but preferably $10 million. John
Frawley, president of ML Futures Investment Partners Inc., a
subsidiary of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., says he also would look
for at least $10 million of customer funds under management.
   The pros also suggest some additional screening factors.
The 10 CTAs in the accompanying table, for example, are ones
identified by Mr. Oberuc as having average annual returns of
at least 15% and maximum drawdowns of no more than 20% in the
three years through last December. To make the list, a CTA
also had to have been trading during the entire three years
and still be accepting new investors.
   While nearly all of the CTAs in the table require sizable
minimums to open an account, some introducing brokers have
put together private pools that let investors access some of
the best with a relatively small investment. For example,
Steben Asset Management Inc., Bethesda, Md., has such a pool.
It employs AZF Commodity Management, Fundamental Futures
Inc., Tiverton Trading Inc. and Trout as CTAs, but requires
only $25,000 to open an account. Investors with as little as
$10,000 to put into action can do so through a private pool
offered by Manhattan Advisory Services Inc. This pool uses
several CTAs, including Trout.

   Signs of Falling Production
   Come as the Cartel Calls
   Meeting to Boost Prices

   OPEC's runaway production, the cause of the recent oil
price slide, is slowing down, apparently because buyers are
simply refusing to absorb any more.
   Signs of an involuntary cutback began to surface yesterday
even as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
called an emergency meeting aimed at reducing output and
reversing the price slide. The session is to begin May 2 in
Geneva.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The expectation that OPEC might regain production
discipline produced at least a brief turnaround in the
depressed oil market, pushing some crude prices up as much as
$1 a barrel.
   But just in the last week or so, the organization's
production already has been trimmed by 400,000 to 600,000
barrels a day, according to confidential reports by people in
and out of OPEC who monitor its production.
   That puts total OPEC output at around 23.5 million barrels
a day -- still 1.5 million barrels over the ceiling but well
below the eight-year high of 24 million barrels a day that
was reached only two to three weeks ago. That level of output
sent world petroleum prices skidding.
   People who monitor OPEC output said the cutbacks appear to
be widespread and reflect a shortage of buyers -- and tankers
-- for OPEC's flood of oil, and not any sudden resurgence in
the organization's ability to keep its chronic quota cheaters
in line.
   "There is too much oil chasing too few buyers, and some
member countries are throttling back," said a senior OPEC
official.
   The lower OPEC output is coming at a critical time for
world oil markets. Production probably isn't low enough yet
to eliminate the oil glut, but it is likely to resurrect
earlier industry projections of firming oil markets by late
this quarter, or certainly in the second half.
   Barring recessions in the bigger oil-consuming nations,
petroleum demand is widely projected to increase in the
second half. For OPEC, that rise is expected to translate
into a gain of two million barrels a day or more from its
current level.
   The second quarter is traditionally a sluggish period for
oil demand. Although estimates vary widely, demand for OPEC
oil is estimated to be running at 21 million to 22 million
barrels a day currently. But up until the last several days,
OPEC continued to pump oil at much higher rates, averaging
some 23.8 million barrels daily in March.
   As a result, OPEC oil has begun to back up in storage and
at sea.
   It is difficult to say exactly how much oil might be at
sea at any given time. "But it's safe to say that it's the
highest we have seen for this time of the year in the last
two or three years," said a European tracker of oil tankers.
   Roy Mason, a Yorkshire, England, oil statistician and
publisher of Oil Afloat, which monitors tanker traffic,
estimated that there are currently 430 million barrels of oil
at sea. That's below the 450 million barrels on the water at
the beginning of this year but well above the 385 million
barrels a year ago, he said.
   More important, a larger than usual portion of the oil
appears to be owned by producing countries instead of traders
or refiners, he said. "What may well be true," he said, "is
that there is more unsold oil on the water than in the past
two years."
   It isn't for lack of trying that producers don't have more
buyers. Nearly all OPEC members -- from Saudi Arabia, the
largest exporter, to Ecuador, one of the smallest -- recently
have been sweetening pricing terms, offering new discounts.
   Yesterday, Ecuador oil officials confirmed an offer to
reduce the pricing formula for their export crude, calculated
on the basis of spot prices of some other crudes, by 40 cents
a barrel. But not all customers have accepted the new offer,
which came after lengthy negotiations. So Ecuador may have to
store even more of its oil in tankers in the Caribbean.
   Ecuador isn't alone. Iran is said to have at least five
and perhaps as many as eight so-called VLCCs (very large
crude carriers) full of unsold oil off Europe.
   Energy Security Analysis Inc., which monitors supplies of
oil onshore, estimated 1.54 billion barrels of crude oil were
in inventories at the end of March. That was up sharply from
the 1.45 billion barrels it measured at the end of March
1989.
   Edward N. Krapels, president of the Washington firm, said
that Energy Security's crude oil index is indicating a "large
surplus" for the first time in 15 months. The index measures
crude supplies in terms of days of refinery operations.
   "Sooner or later," said Mr. Krapels, "there has to be a
production response" to the buildup of crude inventories
because "the buyers aren't there."
   New tabulations show that production response already has
come from some countries. Several OPEC members aren't
producing as much as their quotas allow. Although three big
Persian Gulf producers -- Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates
and Saudi Arabia -- remain above quota, their output appears
to be slipping. Current output of Saudi Arabia, OPEC's
kingpin with a quota of 5.4 million barrels a day, is said to
be around 5.9 million. But much, if not all, the extra oil is
understood to be going into storage.
   The May 2 meeting of the oil ministers is intended to
obtain voluntary cutbacks by all the overproducers. "We
should be able to get reductions at least for a couple
months," said a senior official in one of the OPEC
delegations.

   Peru's Match Made in Heaven Turns Sour

   Peru is playing out a tragedy of Greek proportions. The
political drama reaches well beyond Alberto Fujimori, the
surprise spoiler who has scrupulously avoided revealing any
specific answers to the nation's economic crisis but is now
favored to win the presidential runoff against
novelist-turned-candidate Mario Vargas Llosa.
   The actual key antagonists are well known to the readers
of these pages. In addition to Mr. Vargas Llosa, there is the
Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto, author of the
free-enterprise classic, "The Other Path." The story of their
fruitful association and tragic breakup helps explain why a
candidacy that seemed ensured has become a long shot.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Before their collaborative efforts, the two men followed
remarkably similar quests. Both achieved success outside
Latin America but were not content to rest on their laurels.
They were driven by a desire to remedy Latin America's social
and economic inequities. Their quest for answers drew them
first to the socialist camp. But while the status quo was
unacceptable to them, the socialist alternative turned out to
be worse; one socialist experiment after another degenerated
into repressive regimes.
   The two men were forced by their convictions to renounce
their old leftist philosophy and politics at a time when to
do so meant social, if not professional, suicide. Many
friends were lost in the process.
   Both men continued their investigations in their own ways.
Through the characters in his novels and in his political
essays, Mr. Vargas Llosa examined the political and emotional
dimensions of the totalitarian temptation. Mr. de Soto was
busy documenting the social and economic consequences of
statist control. His pathbreaking research culminated in his
book on the underground economy, "El Otro Sendero." Mr. de
Soto's conclusions -- emphasizing the need to create clear
property rights and eliminate statist favoritism -- appealed
greatly to Mr. Vargas Llosa, who publically endorsed Mr. de
Soto's work.
   The two men joined forces in the early 1980s to set up the
Institute for Liberty and Democracy (ILD). It seemed like a
libertarian's match made in heaven: The consummate technician
drew up the plans for deregulation, and the internationally
recognized artist used his aura and poetic appeal to sell the
agenda. Just the kind of union that would terrify a statist
politician.
   Enter the drama's final antagonist: President Alan Garcia.
   In 1987 President Garcia attempted a desperate maneuver to
enrich the state's reserves, depleted by years of deficit
spending: He attempted to nationalize the banks. The
president had no reason to believe that anyone except a few
wealthy bankers and businessmen would put up a fuss to the
nationalization scheme. He was soon to regret his ignorance.
   Shortly after President Garcia announced his plans to
nationalize the banks, Mr. de Soto and the ILD got busy
campaigning against it. Through their network of underground
workers, they organized local meetings and a huge rally in
Lima on Aug. 21 to protest the nationalization effort. The
mass rally was an enormous success, drawing as many as
100,000. Despite Mr. de Soto's efforts at setting up the
rally, the star was Mr. Vargas Llosa.
   The public rallied around the issue. President Garcia was
forced to drop his nationalization plan. And a new political
star was born. President Garcia was humiliated and vowed
revenge. He did not have to wait long for his opportunity.
   Shortly after the successful 1987 rally, Mr. de Soto and
Mr. Vargas Llosa began to disagree about political
directions. Mr. de Soto was skeptical about joining forces
with the established, conservative politicos, realizing that
their protected interests rarely coincided with the concept
of a truly competitive market. Mr. Vargas Llosa felt that,
after all, established business interests had less to fear
from losing some of their favors than from losing everything
through a socialist administration. Besides, their political
and financial infrastructure was necessary for a successful
presidential bid.
   Mr. de Soto began publically criticizing Mr. Vargas Llosa.
"He's surrounding himself with all the people he doesn't need
. . . the traditional right . . . the old cronies," Mr. de
Soto told the Christian Science Monitor in April 1988. Still
Mr. Vargas Llosa continued to support Mr. de Soto's work,
writing a glowing forward to the 1988 English edition of "The
Other Path." But the rift grew wider.
   President Garcia saw his chance. Forbidden to run for a
second consecutive term, he was anxious to continue leading
his party, APRA, until 1995 when he will be eligible to run
again. But he had an image problem. If he could change his
negative image as a statist and dislodge the Vargas Llosa
phenomenon, he'd be killing two birds with one stone.
   The easiest way to do the latter was to cut off Mr. Vargas
Llosa's ties with the downtrodden and marry him, in the mind
of the public, with the established political elitists who
now supported him. To do the former would mean shaking hands
with an enemy, but President Garcia invited Mr. de Soto to
work for his government.
   The opportunity to put his theories to the test proved
irresistible to Mr. de Soto, who began a joint project with
the government of Peru to deregulate the economy and
guarantee property rights for the poor. Mr. Vargas Llosa was
reportedly furious. While avoiding public criticisms of Mr.
de Soto, he and his supporters told friends and associates
that Mr. de Soto was being used by President Garcia.
   Mr. de Soto, meanwhile, justified his work with President
Garcia by saying that laws must be changed before any one
leader could change the system. In fact, before the election,
the ILD issued an ad that pictured four leading candidates
(including Mr. Vargas Llosa but excluding Mr. Fujimori) above
which was the headline: "How can we avoid having one of them
as our next dictator?"
   Mr. Fujimori, who got 29% of the first-round ballots
against Mr. Vargas Llosa's 31%, is favored to win the June
runoff with the support of APRA and other leftist parties. It
may well be that he is enough of a political opportunist both
to accept the support of the left and adopt a free-market
platform. However, opportunists who embrace free-market ideas
out of political necessity very often lack the guts needed to
stick with a true free-market program.
   As former Chilean Finance Minister Hernan Buchi said last
November in this space, it's easy to start the process of
dismantling a statist economy, but "to maintain these changes
{in the face of constant pressure from special-interest
groups} takes a daily recommitment to the open-market
philosophy." Mario Vargas Llosa did not become an advocate
for the free market through political opportunism but through
a deeply philosophical understanding of its value.
   If, as has been reported, Mr. Fujimori relied on a network
of evangelical Christians to do his campaigning, Mr. de
Soto's network of underground workers could yet be galvinized
to come out and support the man who, with Mr. de Soto, has
championed their cause for so long. Will it happen? Greek
tragedies aren't known for their happy endings.

   WASHINGTON -- Development of a new drug takes an average
of 12 years and costs $231 million, according to the Center
for the Study of Drug Development, an industry-funded
research group affiliated with Tufts University.
   "Costs have more than doubled" from those found in a
similar study done by the center a decade ago, said Joseph
DiMasi, a research associate.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DiMasi at a news conference attributed the rise in
costs to the use of more patients in clinical trials,
increasingly complex testing and growing interest in
developing treatments for "chronic and degenerative diseases"
like cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
   Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health
Research Group, questioned the validity of the center's
findings because they include the cost of developing
ineffective drugs that never come to market.
   Despite the increasing difficulty of drug research and
development, Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association
President Gerald Mossingraff said, "new drug development is
proceeding at a healthy pace." He said the group's latest
survey found that 104 drug products were in human tests or
awaiting review at the Food and Drug Administration, a 30%
increase over last year.
   An unreleased study by Henry Grabowski, an economist at
Duke University, found only 30% of all new drugs earn back
their research-and-development costs. Mr. Grabowski said the
return on all drug research and development is 9%, after
inflation.

   Economy:
   Regional Disparity in Economic Growth
   Narrowed Last Year, Government Says

   WASHINGTON -- Disparities in economic growth among
different parts of the country narrowed last year as the New
England economy slowed and the Rocky Mountain and
Southwestern economies accelerated, new Commerce Department
figures show.
   After narrowing for 40 years, regional differences in
per-capita income widened significantly in the 1980s. But the
new figures support the predictions of some economists that
the last decade saw powerful but transitory economic shocks
rather than a reversal of the long-running trend.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Per-capita personal income grew by 6.6% in New England
last year, a tad better than the 6.5% national average but
far slower than the 8% growth to which the region had become
accustomed in recent years.
   Because New England's economy grew so much faster than
that of the rest of the country earlier in the 1980s,
however, that six-state region remains the richest part of
the U.S. with income of $21,509 per person, more than 20%
above the national average of $17,567.
   Personal income includes wages, earnings of the
self-employed, rent, interest and dividends. It isn't
adjusted for taxes, inflation or differences in living costs
among regions.
   Earnings increases in New England's manufacturing and
service industries last year were the smallest since 1975,
the Commerce Department said, and construction earnings
declined for the first time since that year.
   In contrast, economic growth accelerated in the five Rocky
Mountain states for the third consecutive year. Per-capita
income grew 6.7% in 1989, up from 5.4% in 1988 and 4% in
1987. The region still lags much of the country, with
per-capita income of $15,316.
   Earnings in service industries in the Rocky Mountain
states grew faster than the national average for the first
time since 1982. Construction earnings picked up after three
years of declines. Farm income also rose. Only in Wyoming did
the growth in per-capita income slip below the 1988 rate.
   In the four-state Southwest region that includes Texas,
per-capita income grew by 6.1%, outstripping the 5.4% growth
in 1988 and 3% in 1987. But at $15,231, the region's
per-capita income was below that of every other section of
the country.
   The Southeast has the poorest states, but the region's
average is lifted by the prosperity of Virginia and Florida.
Mississippi had the lowest per-capita personal income last
year at $11,835. Connecticut had the highest at $24,604.

   Cervical Cancer Mortality
   Is Higher for Black Women

   ATLANTA -- Mortality rates linked to cervical cancer are
twice as high among black women as among whites, according to
new statistics published by the federal Centers for Disease
Control.
   The study, which examines data from 1980 to 1987, shows
that, while mortality rates declined for both groups over the
period, black women were still twice as likely to succumb to
the cancer. In 1987, an average of 7.6 deaths occurred among
every 100,000 black women, while 2.9 deaths occurred among
every 100,000 white women.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The mortality rates varied widely by race and state. For
whites, the rates ranged from 1.8 per 100,000 in Utah to 5.2
per 100,000 in West Virginia. For black women, rates ranged
from 5.7 per 100,000 in Washington State to 11.5 per 100,000
in Delaware and Nevada.
   The study noted that services for early detection of
cervical cancer -- particularly the Pap smear test -- have
substantially reduced mortality rates in recent decades. But
researchers added that black women still remain more
vulnerable to the illness because of, among other factors,
disparities in medical treatment after being screened for
cervical cancer.

   11% Gain in Net,

   Aerospace Concern Didn't
   Take Any Write-Downs
   For the First Quarter

   CALABASAS, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp., with improved
performances from its technological services and aeronautical
systems segments, said first-quarter profit increased 11% on
an 8% sales climb.
   Perhaps most importantly, the nation's No. 6 Pentagon
contractor had no writedowns for the first three months of
1990, marking the first time in a year that the aerospace
concern hasn't been plagued by cost overruns on one project
or another.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But it may take some doing to keep the slate clean from
here on out. Lockheed is now locked in negotiations with the
Navy over terms of production on the P-7 anti-submarine
aircraft. And if the government were bent on holding the
company to pricing commitments it made earlier, it could
"drag the whole corporation down the tubes," said Michael
Beltramo, a Los Angeles defense industry consultant.
   Even a relatively small write-down on the P-7 would be a
blow to Lockheed's chairman, Daniel Tellep, who repeatedly
trumpeted during the company's recent proxy fight with Dallas
billionaire Harold Simmons that he had finally put such cost
overruns behind the company.
   For the first quarter, Lockheed earned $69 million, or
$1.09 a share, vs. $62 million, or $1.04 a share. The
year-earlier results included $4 million in losses at the
company's information services businesses, which have since
been sold. Sales jumped to $2.25 billion from $2.09 billion.
   Across the company, profits tripled to $15 million from an
anemic $5 million at the aeronautical systems unit, and rose
to $13 million from $9 million in the technological services
area. Lockheed said it also benefited from a lower income-tax
rate.
   Those gains were partially offset, however, by a 5% drop
in profits at the company's missiles and space unit; the cost
of the proxy contest with Mr. Simmons's company, NL
Industries Inc., which ran to about $15 million; and a 90%
plunge in earnings to $1 million from $10 million in the
electronics segment, where the revenue base shrunk
significantly.
   But it's the potential for much bigger problems at
Lockheed that has the industry alarmed right now. The company
already has written off $300 million for the development of
the P-7 because its engineers miscalculated how much the
plane had in common with Lockheed's old submarine hunter, the
P-3.
   When it signed the development pact, Lockheed also
apparently gave certain target projections for costs of
production. Now, with the program having slipped two years
behind schedule, it has become clear that there is no way it
can stick to those numbers. Some trade publications have even
speculated that if the Navy were to exercise its options and
press Lockheed, the company could stand to lose nearly $3
billion from the 125-plane accord.
   That doesn't seem likely to happen though. Since the
beginning of the year, Mr. Tellep has met several times with
Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett to work out a compromise on
the P-7. Service officials close to the secretary suggested
that the two sides are trying to determine how much it really
will cost at this point to manufacture P-7s, how many can be
afforded in a tighter budget environment and who would absorb
what costs.
   Whatever the Navy decides to do, Mr. Tellep has made it
clear to Wall Street analysts that Lockheed isn't going to
build P-7s at a deficit. He even indicated that the Navy
could ultimately decide just to terminate the contract,
letting Lockheed off the hook. It's unclear what would happen
if the company were to unilaterally default.
   Mr. Tellep has declined to be interviewed about the P-7
for the past few weeks.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Lockheed shares closed at $35.875, down 75 cents.
   Separately, Lockheed responded to a federal court suit
filed eariler this week by Mr. Simmons that challenged the
legality and fairness of last month's director elections.
Lockheed, in a statement, called the action "nothing more
than pure harassment that will continue to divert management
attention and corporate resources."

   SCOTTS VALLEY, Calif. -- In buying Imprimis Technology
Inc. last October, Seagate Technology Inc. found that it also
bought a lawsuit.
   The computer disk-drive maker said it was sued in state
court in Santa Clara County by rival Conner Peripherals Inc.
The suit charges that Seagate cut off Conner's supply of thin
film heads from Imprimis despite a guarantee that it wouldn't
do so. Conners uses the film heads to manufacture hard-disk
drives.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Seagate declined further comment on the suit. Conners said
it took the action because Seagate's action amounted to a
"breach of contract" that has crimped production of some
disk-drive products. But a spokesman said Conners has been
able to find components elsewhere, and that it doesn't expect
the shortage to hurt future financial results.
   Conners is asking the court for unspecified damages.
   Seagate's stock, meanwhile, fell $3.125 to $12.50 in
over-the-counter trading yesterday. But the company said it
didn't think the drop was related to the suit. On Wednesday,
Seagate reported quarterly earnings of 44 cents a share,
which a spokesman said were "below expectations but hardly a
disaster."

   Sotheby's Asks Art Sellers to Lower Expectations

   NEW YORK -- Sotheby's Holdings Inc., jittery after some
poorly received auctions in London earlier this month, is
pressing some sellers to scale down their expectations.
   The giant London-based auction house is asking sellers to
lower the "reserves," or the minimum prices they'll accept,
for artworks set to be offered during May's
multimillion-dollar auction season.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The lackluster results of Impressionist and Russian art
sales in London this month indicate that the torrid pace of
appreciation in many art-market prices "is slowing down,"
said Sotheby's President Michael Ainslie.
   A last-minute request to sellers to lower reserves "is the
auctioneer's usual plaintive cry," Mr. Ainslie said. But
prices of Impressionist and modern paintings "have been
appreciating at a rate of 40% per year in the past two years,
and we think {the rate of appreciation is} very likely to
slow down," he said. "We're using the results from the April
sales to say: `You should be getting more realistic.'"
   Getting sellers to lower their reserves is of particular
importance to Sotheby's this year. The company is risking its
own capital to guarantee prices on some of the most desirable
works -- effectively underwriting their sale and agreeing to
buy them itself if bidders don't push prices higher than the
guarantees.
   Some sellers of art that Sotheby's hasn't guaranteed said
they'll balk if approached with a request to lower reserves.
And Sotheby's rival Christie's International PLC said it
disagrees with Sotheby's assessment -- at least so far.
   "I'm not Pollyanna, and I'm not looking for a 90% sales
rate {at the May auctions}," said Michael Findlay, head of
the Impressionist and modern paintings department at
Christie's. "But it's too early to have those kinds of
conversations" with sellers.
   Pre-sale interest on the part of Japanese collectors is at
least as strong as it's ever been, and the overall quality of
the works up for sale is far better than at the London sales,
Mr. Findlay contends. "You can't yet say the market has
changed drastically."
   Christie's had good results at its evening London sales,
with only 21% of its Impressionist works -- by dollar value
-- failing to sell, and 1% of Russian avant-garde paintings
bought-in. Sotheby's evening London sales earlier this month
didn't fare so well, with 36% of the Impressionist works and
76% of its Russian art unsold. In recent years, buy-in rates
of under 25% -- sometimes well under -- have been common.
   Mr. Ainslie has called the stabilization of prices
"healthy for the market." Some analysts even see a silver
lining to the problem auctions. "If people were a little
overaggressive in their reserves, reserves are correctable up
to the sale," said Harvey Katz, analyst at Salomon Brothers
Inc. "It's a self-correcting mechanism."
   The morning after its disappointing London Impressionist
sale, Sotheby's stock fell $2 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange, although it recovered later in the session to close
down $1.25, at $21.375. The stock has continued to hover at
that level, closing yesterday at $21.625, up 12.5 cents.
   "It wasn't the market that crashed, it was a few sales,"
that featured mediocre merchandise, said art dealer David
Killen. For high-quality art -- such as the Vincent van Gogh
and Pierre-Auguste Renoir masterpieces each auction house
plans to sell next month -- "there's still enough money to
buy the moon."

   Anchor Savings
   Sets Write-Down,
   To Sell Branches

   HEWLETT, N.Y. -- Anchor Savings Bank, to meet capital
requirements, said it will take a $175 million write-down and
expects to sell 68 Anchor branches and more than $2 billion
in deposits.
   As a result of the write-down, Anchor reported a loss for
its fiscal third quarter ended March 31 of $169.4 million, or
$9.87 a share, compared with a loss of $1 million, or 26
cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding the one-time charge,
Anchor had a net loss of $3 million, compared with a loss of
$7.3 million a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The write-down is part of Anchor's compliance with a plan
approved by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision to
eliminate a $331 million capital shortfall. The plan is meant
to bring Anchor into capital compliance within two years by
selling assets.
   Anchor is expected to sell bank branches, mortgage
servicing rights, mortgage loans and other assets that could
total about $140 million.
   The bank will also convert cumulative preferred stock for
non-cumulative stock, or an instrument which can be counted
as core capital, adding about $157 million in capital.
   James M. Large Jr., chairman of Anchor, said under the
plan the bank will "refocus on its traditional markets" in
northern New Jersey, New York City and Long Island,
concentrating on consumer deposits, homeowner mortgages,
supporting services.
   Mr. Large said Anchor will sell its branches in Georgia,
Florida and southern New Jersey. Some branches in northern
New Jersey may also be sold.
   Under general accounting standards, the anticipated branch
sales require the write off of $175 million in supervisory
goodwill. The goodwill was created when Anchor acquired
branches through a series of government-related mergers in
the early 1980s.
   After the sale, Anchor will have $8 billion in assets, of
which $5 billion will be deposits. The bank, in the last
year, has reduced staff from about 3,200 to its current level
of about 2,100.

   To Sacrifice to Reduce

   Auto dealer Mark Medeiros worries that customers at his
Dartmouth, Mass., car lot may stage a mini-rebellion at
paying $100 to perhaps $600 more for a new car in a decade
because of new air-pollution equipment.
   Still, he is willing to face such buyer resistance if it
means cleaner air. "Environmental protection has been moving
too slowly," he says, "much slower than the pace at which
we've been polluting the planet."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As major new clean-air legislation makes its way through
Congress, Americans are increasingly being asked to make
sacrifices in the name of the environment. And according to a
new nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, a majority,
like Mr. Medeiros, say they are by and large willing to make
those tough tradeoffs in order to have a cleaner world. The
reason is that as Sunday's 20th anniversary of Earth Day
nears, people are far more likely to be worrying than
celebrating.
   The survey, covering 1,001 respondents, indicates that a
full two-thirds of registered voters think the environment is
in worse shape today than it was 20 years ago. By an even
more overwhelming ratio of six to one, voters say they want
to protect the environment even if it means they will have to
pay higher prices. That is a sea change from 1981, when the
ratio was only five to four.
   "Americans are playing for keeps when it comes to the
environment," say pollsters Peter Hart and Robert Teeter, who
conducted the sampling for the Journal and NBC. "Every
indicator in this survey suggests that voters care about the
environment, that they are personally making efforts to
protect the environment and that they are willing to change
their behavior and purchasing habits in order to ensure that
we have a cleaner world."
   More than eight of 10, for instance, say they are willing
to separate their trash for recycling, give up plastic
fast-food containers and superfluous packaging to reduce
waste, and get their cars inspected and tuned up yearly to
cut tailpipe emissions. By three to one, voters say they
would favor a ban on disposable diapers.
   In addition, 68% would be willing to pay up to $600 more
for a less-polluting car; 57% favor stricter air-pollution
requirements even if these added $10 a month to their
electricity bill; 57% also would favor requiring urban
commuters to ride public transportation to work once a week;
and just over half, 51%, would be willing to see limits
placed on the number of large cars that could be produced.
   Robert Cashon, a 56-year-old retired engineer in
Huntsville, Ala., is disturbed by the television images of
severe air pollution in Eastern Europe and worries that the
world faces a "slow death" from pollution. He suggests
Americans should make sacrifices so the U.S. can serve as a
model for other polluting nations. "I think business people
have done a lot to really abuse and rape the land from way
back," he says. "The bottom line is all they know."
   Adds Cindy Pittman, a 32-year-old office clerk in Kent,
Wash.: "I just figure I'm pretty young now and I've got a
long way to go. I want to protect it for myself and my kids."
   Of course, people might have second thoughts about some of
the tradeoffs if actually faced with the prospect of having
to make them. For instance, the poll found that even 56% of
those with children under age three favor a ban on disposable
diapers, a figure that might drop significantly if this
became a real possibility.
   Along the same lines, Gene Manzone isn't sure customers
appreciate the new pollution equipment he has already
installed at his New Bedford, Mass., service station,
including new pump nozzles that catch gasoline fumes. "I can
tell them prices are going up to help clean the air that they
breathe, and they'll go down the street to save three cents a
gallon," he says.
   Yet the poll findings are important in showing how people
view the issue. "They indicate how strongly people would like
to believe they are part of the move to improve the
environment," say Mr. Hart, a Democrat, and Mr. Teeter, a
Republican. The environment has seemingly transcended
political debate; it has almost become socially unacceptable
not to be concerned about it. When voters are asked to rate
the importance of environmental protection on a 10-point
scale, 72% give it an 8, 9 or 10.
   There are limits to people's good environmental
intentions. The Journal/NBC poll shows that 59% oppose
closing polluting factories if that would put people out of
work, while voters are evenly split over a 20-cent-a-gallon
increase for cleaner-burning fuel, a prospect that could be a
reality for the nine smoggiest U.S. cities under the
clean-air bill passed by the Senate.
   By far the most difficult tradeoff, in the poll as in
people's lives, is the one between pollution and jobs. The
Senate legislation would force industry to spend, by one
estimate, up to $21.5 billion a year by the year 2005 to
clean up the atmosphere, and it would almost certainly cost
thousands of jobs in coal mines and possibly factories.
   Though the bill isn't even law yet, it has already claimed
its first victims. About 45 miners of high-sulfur coal at
Pittsburg-Midway Coal Mining Co. in economically depressed
southeast Kansas are out of a job; the mine closed when its
only customer, a utility based in Joplin, Mo., took early
steps to reduce emissions blamed for acid rain and switched
in December to cleaner-burning Wyoming coal. "Plenty of coal
remains, but we have no market for it," says Fred Meurer,
spokesman for the Kansas coal company.
   While voters in the Journal/NBC poll are worried about job
losses because of new environmental regulation, six in 10 of
them think it not very likely or not at all likely that their
own job will be either directly or indirectly affected; about
one-third think it very or somewhat likely that they will be
affected.
   The tradeoffs go well beyond job losses. For instance,
Congress is considering a ban on methyl chloroform by the
year 2000 because the widely used solvent is damaging the
atmosphere's protective ozone layer. But there's currently no
good replacement that is as safe for workers and will perform
as well in some applications. One such use is cleaning the
ends of wire rope used in bridges, on cranes -- and to catch
jets landing on aircraft carriers. "It's extremely important
that {the cable} be perfectly clean" to allow a solid weld in
a socket, says Mike Catino, vice president of engineering at
Paulsen Wire Rope Corp. in Sunbury, Pa. If a cable pulled out
of a socket on a carrier, he says, "you would drop a $30
million aircraft into the ocean."
   In Ashland, Ky., the choice may come down to healthier air
or competitiveness. Clean-air legislation threatens to wipe
out the pricing edge gained by an Armco Steel Co. plant when
it inaugurated a new $60 million thick-slab caster last
month. Considered the salvation of the aging mill, the caster
is expected to cut slightly more than $20 a ton off the cost
of making steel at Ashland. But tough new pollution-control
measures being proposed for coke ovens could add back that
$20 a ton.
   There will be ripple effects as well. To pay for reducing
emissions blamed for acid rain, for instance, Associated
Electric Cooperative Inc. in Springfield, Mo., expects to
raise its electricity rates as much as 20%. The co-op's
biggest industrial customer, a Noranda Aluminum Inc. plant in
New Madrid, Mo., says that because of market pressures it
will have to swallow the extra $15.5 million a year itself.
And that could cut the annual profit-sharing check that Rick
Miller, a 37-year-old smelter employee, has come to count on.
   For unionized plant workers, the check can mean a bonus of
$8,000 on top of wages of $24,000 to $28,000. "My profit
sharing went into CDs for college for my children," frets Mr.
Miller, who has three teen-agers. Moreover, "if the company's
profit dropped, it's gonna make it tougher to get a raise out
of them" in the next contract negotiations.
   The poll found that no single environmental issue
dominates the debate. Toxic waste, air and water pollution
and garbage were the ones most often cited. But in Medford,
Ore., for instance, the issue of whether new clean-air rules
will require sharply higher emissions fees from local
industry pales before concern over whether the federal
government will designate the northern spotted owl as a
threatened species. That could put large tracts of federal
timber off-limits to loggers.
   "If there's no timber to cut, we're not going to have to
worry about additional fees," says Larry Gill, an engineer at
Medford Corp., which makes plywood and veneer.
   The Journal/NBC poll found that many voters haven't yet
focused on the clean-air legislation and the tradeoffs it
will require; only about four in 10 voters have heard or read
about the bill so far. Yet the intensity of environmental
feeling is such that there's little evidence more attention
to the bill will make them change their minds. In fact, of
those who do know about the bill, 40% think it doesn't go far
enough, while 33% think it has about the right balance and
only 6% think it goes too far.
   While the poll found that 45% believe the quality of air
in their communities is about the same as it was 20 years
ago, three times more people think it has gotten worse than
think it has gotten better. In terms of overall environmental
protection, 45% feel the U.S. is doing better than most other
major countries, 37% say about the same and 13% think the
U.S. is worse.
   People don't view the environmental issue in very partisan
terms. Democrats have an edge of just 22% to 14% as the party
people think handles the environment better; nearly half of
those polled see the two parties as the same on the issue. In
contrast to their high regard for President Bush in other
areas, voters approve of his environmental record by only 49%
to 41%, which may reflect more on their worry about the
problem than on concerns about specific Bush actions or
policies.
   Another mark of how seriously people view the environment
is their report in the poll of how their concerns are
changing their daily lives and consuming habits. Seventy-six
percent say they have changed the kinds of products they buy
and use because of environmental concerns. By large
majorities, they say they already recycle their newspapers,
bottles and aluminum cans, and conserve water, electricity
and natural gas at home. But as for taking car pools or
public transportation to reduce driving, more don't than do.
   One who has adapted his life more than most to live in
better harmony with the environment is Pat Stone, 40, a
former assistant editor at Mother Earth News magazine. He
spent money to equip his home in rural Fairview, N.C., with
solar panels, extra insulation and special windows to
conserve energy. He grows organic vegetables for the family
dinner table and raised four children in cloth diapers.
   Yet there was one tradeoff even he couldn't make. To
accommodate his large family, he drives a gas-guzzling 1983
Buick station wagon that he bought used for $3,000 because he
couldn't afford a new model with gas mileage possibly twice
as good.
   "You can't lead an environmentally pure life in this
world," he says. "The only way to act is to do what you can."

   American Express Had 1st-Quarter Loss
   Of $619.8 Million Due to Shearson Stake

   NEW YORK -- American Express Co. posted a loss of $619.8
million for the first quarter, the largest quarterly loss in
the company's 140-year history.
   American Express had a loss of $1.50 a share compared with
a profit of 59 cents a share, or $251.9 million, a year
earlier. Revenue in the quarter increased to $5.90 billion
from $5.87 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The loss, which resulted from American Express's
investment in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., was expected.
Earlier in the week, Shearson reported a $915 million loss
for its first quarter. The loss by American Express for its
Shearson holdings amounted to $883 million, the company said.
American Express intends to acquire all outstanding Shearson
shares.
   On the plus side, American Express's three other major
divisions reported record first quarters. Net income at
Travel Related Services rose 16% to $215 million, IDS
Financial Services earned $44 million, a gain of 21%, and
profits at Information Services Co. jumped 27% to $22
million.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
American Express shares closed at $27.625 a share, down
$1.25.
   "You've got three Cadillacs at American Express in their
travel, financial planning and information processing
divisions, and it's a shame, to put it mildly, that Shearson
has been such a disappointment," said Gerald Lewinsohn, an
analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "American Express could have
exercised more control over Shearson management, but you have
to give them credit for doing a good job with their other
operations."
   Mr. Lewinsohn said he would have preferred to have seen
stronger growth in the charge and credit card business at
TRS, but he noted that the economy has become sluggish. Cards
in use rose nearly 9.6% to 36 million, but analysts had
become accustomed to double-digit percentage gains.
   "The important thing is that the charge volume was up 13%,
which is pretty good," Mr. Lewinsohn said. American Express
reported that world-wide charge volume grew to $26 billion
and that the number of service establishments that accept the
company's cards now tops three million, up 15%.
   Richard Wallman, an analyst with Argus Research Corp.,
said that when the bad news about Shearson emerged, he
downgraded his recommendation on the company to a hold. "I'm
bullish long-term, but I want to wait a little longer before
changing my recommendation," he said. "They really wanted to
get rid of Shearson but couldn't find an agreeable buyer. Now
maybe they'll get it under control."
   One analyst found the performance of the TRS division less
exciting than in the past. TRS is frequently described as the
crown jewel of American Express.
   "We'd been seeing annual net income gains of 18%, and now
it's dropped to 15.7%," said Frank DeSantis Jr., an analyst
at PaineWebber Group Inc. "Relative to the last three years,
there has been a slowdown in the basic dynamics of the TRS
business. It is, however, consistent with the slowdown in the
general economy."
   Mr. DeSantis said most businesses would be pleased to
report earnings increases of nearly 16%.
   "If American Express just consisted of TRS, the value of
the stock would be a lot higher," said Mr. DeSantis. "The
thesis that American Express is worth more broken up has been
prevalent for a while and is right."
   Mr. DeSantis added that he expects American Express to
issue stock in the second quarter to raise equity capital.
American Express has stated its intentions of raising $750
million, but it isn't known whether the company will do this
publicly, by private placement or through a combination of
the two.

   Greenspan Says Banks Have Tightened
   Lending but Sees No Credit Crunch Now

FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
banks in New England and other regions have tightened their
lending standards but it's too soon to say that a credit
crunch is choking the economy.
   In written answers to questions posed by the Senate
Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed believes banks
are reacting to changing economic conditions, bad loans and
"ongoing scrutiny by regulators."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Such tightening could reduce the amount of credit
provided to businesses and consumers . . . with potential
effects on the level of local economic activity," Mr.
Greenspan said. But responding to a query about Massachusetts
from Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.), the Fed chairman said a
credit crunch "would most likely need to be prolonged and
more severe than we have been able to detect" before it
threatens the economic stability of New England.
   Mr. Greenspan, who said the Fed seeks a prudent balance
between too much restraint on the part of bankers and too
little, noted that bank lending essentially didn't grow at
all in December and January. In February, it grew at an
annual rate of 5.3%. For all of 1989, he noted, bank lending
rose 7.6%. Loan growth in the Northeast and Southwest has
been weaker than the national average. That can reflect
bankers' reluctance to lend or customers' reluctance to
borrow in an uncertain economy or both.
   Mr. Greenspan added that the large losses reported by
thrifts throughout the 1980s and, more recently, by
commercial banks "suggests that financing activity in the
real estate industry, in particular, has been excessive."
   Mr. Greenspan disclosed new Fed data showing that the 50
largest bank-holding companies at the end of last year had
$125.5 billion in loans outstanding to highly leveraged
transactions, a 50% increase from the end of 1988. So far,
those loans, which include bank lending for debt-financed
takeovers, are performing better than other kinds of loans,
the Fed data show. But the proportion of loans for highly
leveraged transactions that are going sour is on the rise.
   The Fed currently is conducting special examinations of
certain banks with high concentrations of such loans "to
determine if significant deterioration is taking place," the
Fed chairman said.

   Commodities:
   World Oil Prices Surge After OPEC Schedules
   An Emergency Meeting of Ministers for May 2

   World oil prices surged after OPEC used a pricing tactic
that has served it well in the past -- the scheduling of a
meeting of the oil ministers.
   North Sea crudes spurted as much as 90 cents a barrel in
European spot markets, and one U.S. crude-futures contract
increased even more, after Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil
minister and acting president of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, set May 2 as the date for
beginning an emergency meeting in Geneva of the market
monitoring committee.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although that policy-setting committee has only eight
ministers, Mr. Boussena invited all 13 of OPEC's oil
ministers to attend the meeting, indicating that it could be
turned into a full OPEC conference. He then postponed to June
25 the regular midyear conference, which previously had been
scheduled to start May 25.
   The May 2 meeting "will examine the measures needed to
halt the constant degradation of the market and to raise
prices so as to re-establish them at the level set by OPEC,"
Mr. Boussena said.
   The announcement sparked heavy trading in most of the
world's oil markets, with prices immediately beginning to
rise. Accelerating the rally were traders who had bet on
further price declines and had to quickly buy contracts to
cover their positions.
   "There was a lot of `short' covering; gasoline was very
strong, but the real interest was in crude," said Eric
Bolling, an energy futures trader in New York with Edge
Trading Corp.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for
May delivery spiraled up 2.23 cents a gallon to settle at
61.78 cents, while the June motor fuel contract jumped the
limit of two cents a gallon. Heating oil futures also were
up, with June and later months showing the bigger gains.
   But the star in futures trading was West Texas
Intermediate crude for May delivery. Analysts said it went up
faster because more traders had bet against it in recent
weeks as prices plummeted. Also, today is the May contract's
last trading day; that may have contributed to the
volatility.
   Whatever the reason, May WTI gained $1.10 a barrel to
settle at $18.06. The June crude contract was up 78 cents to
$18.87.
   Although analysts and traders generally attributed most of
the day's price run-ups to the OPEC announcements, few were
prepared to predict whether previously depressed oil markets
had indeed turned around. "I won't say prices have bottomed,"
said Mr. Bolling, "but they should be trading higher" in the
days ahead.
   In other commodity markets yesterday:
                                                                                                       

   COPPER: Futures prices continued their recent pattern of
moving over a narrow range. The May contract ended with a
gain of 0.40 cent a pound at $1.1660. Nearterm tightness of
supplies is reflected in the premiums being enjoyed by
soonest-to-expire positions in both London and New York over
more deferred contracts. That, plus the continuing Peruvian
miners and smelter workers strike, now in the sixth week,
remain the principal underlying price-supporting factors, one
analyst noted. However, according to William O'Neill, vice
president for research for Elders Futures Inc., New York,
some progress may be taking place in the Peruvian labor
situation. Union leaders representing the workers of Southern
Peru Copper Corp., who walked off March 12, have scheduled a
meeting with company officials, he said. Also, Mr. O'Neill
said, workers who went on strike at the same time at a
separately owned mine, Tintaya, have returned to work.
"Although no agreement has been reached, it has been reported
that union leaders have received an offer they're willing to
accept," he said. While improvement is possible in the
Peruvian situation, he said, it is still unsolved and is
offsetting some of the concern over recent economic
statistics that indicate a slowing economy, particularly
weaker auto sales and poorer employment statistics. The
automobile industry is a major copper-user. Traders who
follow charts also appear to be more cautious, Mr. O'Neill
noted, since there appears to be resistance around the
$1.20-a-pound level for the May contract "and definitely
major resistance at around $1.25."
                                                                                                       

   GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn, wheat and soybean
futures contracts rallied late in the trading session
yesterday amid continuing rumors about the Soviet Union's
interest in making major purchases. At the Chicago Board of
Trade, wheat prices were also supported by concerns about
tight supplies of soft red winter wheat. Supplies of the
crop, which is grown in the Midwest, usually reach their
tightest levels in the spring before the new wheat crops
begin to be harvested. As a result, concerns about a squeeze
on wheat supplies are traditional in April. Despite the
rally, the prospects for the wheat crop in the U.S. continue
to improve, according to Katharina Zimmer, an analyst at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., New York. Fields in the Southern Plains,
where the hard red winter wheat crop is grown, are generally
in their best condition since the 1988 drought began. Some
dry regions of the Pacific Northwest are expected to get
moisture this week.
                                                                                                       

   LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of hog futures contracts rose
amid reports that the slaughter continues to lag behind
normal levels because of tight supplies of fattened hogs. The
low slaughter is causing strong prices of hogs during a time
of the year when prices are usually their weakest. After the
close of trading today, the Agriculture Department is slated
to release its quarterly survey of feedlots in 13 major ranch
states. Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp.,
Arlington Heights, Ill., said he expects the department to
report that the number of cattle on feedlots in those states
rose 1% on April 1 from the same 1989 date. That would be the
largest number in feedlots, which fatten cattle for
slaughter, during an April 1 survey since 1978. Traders
expect the report to indicate that the cattle slaughter
during the second quarter will be heavy.
                                                                                                       

   SUGAR: Futures prices fell back from Wednesday's gains on
a denial by the Soviet Union that it had bought sugar in the
free market. The July contract ended with a loss of 0.26 cent
a pound at 15.30 cents. This decline erased slightly more
than half of the 0.48 cent gain posted Wednesday. Arthur
Stevenson, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New
York, said that an official of Sakhar, the Soviet sugar
trading corporation, stated that the Soviet Union hadn't
bought sugar on the world market. "While that is the answer
one would expect, because they aren't going to reveal such
information," Mr. Stevenson said, "I tend to believe them
this time." Apparently, most traders also thought that way,
because many decided to take profits, he said.

   Market Continues Slide on Earnings;
   Seagate Technology Down About 20%

   Over-the-counter investors continued to punish stocks of
companies with disappointing earnings, sending Seagate
Technology down about 20% in active trading after the
computer disk drive maker reported third-quarter profit below
analysts' expectations.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index closed off 2.52 at 429.00, a
0.58% drop, on 145.6 million shares, down from 149.7 million.
By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped
0.77%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Declining stocks continued to outpace advancers, 1,065 to
820, while 127 stocks hit new lows compared with 83 reaching
new highs.
   "It seems this market is taking earnings disappointments a
lot more strongly than positives," said Peter Coolidge,
senior OTC trader at Kidder Peabody. "If earnings come out
and are in line or a little worse then expected, stocks take
it on the chin. But if they come out a little better than
expected, they don't go up as much."
   Seagate fell 3 1/8 to close at 12 1/8. Apple Computer also
dropped, down 3 at 40 1/4 on 4.3 million shares. The company
told analysts in a conference call late Wednesday that it
expects revenue for the second half of the year to grow only
7% to 10% from a year earlier, rather than 15% or more as
previously estimated, according to Goldman Sachs analyst
Daniel Benton.
   Mr. Benton said he reduced his investment opinion on the
computer manufacturer to a "hold" from a "trading buy"
because of the expected softness. Slower growth should show
up particularly in sales of Apple's less expensive computers,
such as the Macintosh Portable, Mr. Benton said.
   Among gainers was Lotus Development, up 1 to 34 1/4 after
reporting first-quarter earnings on the high end of Wall
Street expectations. The Cambridge, Mass., software maker
attributed the earnings strength to across-the-board customer
demand and accelerated international sales.
   However, technology stocks generally were weaker, noted
Lawrence Rice, manager of OTC trading for Los Angeles-based
Wedbush Morgan Securities. Like Mr. Coolidge of Kidder
Peabody, Mr. Rice said he saw both buying and selling
interest scattered across a number of sectors.
   Among the market's cheerleaders was Mitch Meisler, OTC
director of marketing for Shearson Lehman Hutton, who said he
expects the bond market to "turn on a dime any day now" with
the OTC market following. Mr. Meisler added that he believes
fears of inflation are overblown.
   Among the day's top leaders were two preferred shares of
First Executive Corp., the Los Angeles holder of a large
portfolio of junk bonds. First Executive cumulative preferred
series F jumped 1 5/8 at 8 3/4, while the series E preferred
shares rose 1 3/8 to 5 7/8. Craig Mosovitz, trader at
Interstate/Johnson Lane Securities, said he saw demand for
the preferred issues from investors who were paid their
dividends this week and expect future payments.
   However, Thomas Rosencrants, director of research for the
brokerage's Atlanta office, cautioned that First Executive's
most recent quarterly report indicates it has sufficient
funds to meet its fixed obligations only through 1990, but
will require additional funds for the first quarter of 1991.
Mr. Rosencrants said he's advising investors to avoid First
Executive's preferred and common shares.
   DeKalb Genetics, a commercial seed producer, gained 1 1/2
to 37 3/4 after announcing it had successfully inserted
foreign genes into corn plants. Also gaining was BioTechnica
International, up 3/8 at 4 1/2, which made a similar
bioengineering claim in January.
   Shares of Eastchester Financial, White Plains, N.Y., hit a
new 52-week high at 16 1/4, up 1 1/2, on more than 13 times
average volume after announcing it reached an agreement to be
acquired for $20 a share by North Fork Bancorp, based in
Mattituck, N.Y. Up in sympathy was another New York bank,
Peoples Westchester Savings, which rose 1/4 at 16 1/4.
   Shares of Chemfix Technologies, which treats hazardous
waste, rose 5/8 to 6 3/8 in heavy trading after an analyst at
Rotan Mosle recommended purchase of the stock, according to
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Also, Ohio Casualty
converted its preferred stake into 315,000 shares of Chemfix
common stock, which it then sold, according to the news
service.
   Shares of SciMed Life Systems, a maker of catheters used
in heart surgery, fell 7/8 to 25 7/8 on 1.45 million shares
after a competitor, C. R. Bard, said it sent a letter to
SciMed alleging the company is infringing on a Bard patent,
the investor report said. However, Bard hasn't yet filed a
lawsuit suit alleging patent infringement.
   Mr. Coolidge of Kidder Peabody said profit taking
apparently pressured shares of two companies involved in
cleaning up the environment. Sevenson Environmental Services
fell 2 to 12 3/4 and ERC Environmental &amp; Energy Services lost
3/4 to 11 1/4. Mr. Coolidge noted that "the hype" about the
forthcoming Earth Day had inflated the shares of some
environmental services companies.

   Heard on the Street:
   Morgan Stanley's Relative Assets Add Up,
   Absolutely, to Inflame Its Admirers' Ardor

   NEW YORK -- Compared with its peers, Morgan Stanley
scarcely has the look of a modern, diversified investment
bank.
   It hasn't needed a capital infusion to stay afloat. It
hasn't laid off thousands, or even hundreds, of its
employees. And it hasn't taken a big write-down lately.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What Morgan Stanley does have is a return that far
outstrips other publicly traded Wall Street firms, and,
indeed, outpaces the vast majority of American industry.
Since 1985, Morgan Stanley has earned an average return on
equity of 31%, and the figure has never been lower than 25%
in any year.
   This is hardly a secret. Morgan Stanley has been praised
high and low, especially as other Wall Street firms, such as
Merrill Lynch, Shearson Lehman Hutton, and the First Boston
unit of CS First Boston, have stumbled. Yet Morgan Stanley's
stock languishes at six times the company's 1989 earnings,
and at seven to eight times its estimated net income for
1990.
   "The stock is selling at a significant discount to
intrinsic value," the brokerage firm Dominick &amp; Dominick
says. "It is misperceived as another investment banker about
to suffer from the `end of the '80s.'"
   The relative case for Morgan Stanley is strong. Merrill
Lynch, which apparently is suffering from the end of
something, is trading at about 14 times estimated 1990
earnings. Merrill, as part of a continuing, massive
retrenchment, took a $470 million pretax charge in the fourth
quarter, and its basic business of retail brokerage is slow.
   Yet Merrill's stock, relative to Morgan Stanley's, is
twice as dear. Relative valuations, admittedly, are never
sure bets.
   But Morgan Stanley looks good on an absolute basis, as
well. Analysts say it is well-managed; it competes only in
carefully selected markets, and it has a diversified source
of revenue.
   Julian Robertson, president of Tiger Management and a
Morgan Stanley investor, has a somewhat pithier rationale. He
says Morgan Stanley's stock offers "the most brains for the
money that I know of."
   Dominick's Tony Russ views Morgan Stanley as having two
cash-generating businesses that require little capital:
investment banking and asset management. What distinguishes
Morgan Stanley, he says, is that it has profitably reinvested
its surplus cash into two businesses that do require capital:
trading for its own account, and merchant banking.
   Trading is, by definition, risky, but Morgan Stanley
monitors its operations closely. Its signature has been a
refusal to compete in products that don't provide at least a
25% return.
   "When returns fall, they pull capital away," Mr. Russ
says, "but unlike many others, Morgan has demonstrated it can
pull back from an underperforming business before it produces
serious losses." For example, it has reduced trading in its
own account in index arbitrage, municipal bonds and the
corporate IOUs known as commercial paper, he says.
   In merchant banking, Morgan Stanley has a $250 million
stake in a leveraged buy-out partnership that owns companies
such as Fort Howard Paper and Burlington Industries. This
contributes to earnings only sporadically, when assets are
sold or restructured. And analysts, in estimating earnings,
ignore the partnership.
   But the companies are generating surplus cash, reducing
debt and, in effect, increasing the value of Morgan Stanley's
investment. "This amounts to a hidden stream of cash flow,"
Dominick says.
   Morgan Stanley's investment banking business will suffer
this year, and perhaps for many years, as mergers and junk
bond underwritings fall industrywide. But Morgan Stanley's
strong presence in Europe is partly offsetting the business's
weakness in the U.S. And Morgan Stanley's low stock price and
high credit rating should provide investors with a margin of
comfort.
   Mr. Russ isn't enamored of Morgan Stanley's research,
which he views as a fount of "conventional wisdom." But long
term, Morgan Stanley has a franchise in U.S. investment
banking, and this business is hardly apt to disappear. Mr.
Russ predicts that as the era of the leveraged buy-out fades,
"relationship banking" will re-emerge as important to
clients, and Morgan Stanley will benefit. The firm's outlook
is enhanced, because its employees own 53% of the stock and
are in for the long pull, and because of the way Morgan
Stanley has grown -- in a word: sensibly. By contrast, Mr.
Russ says, "Virtually every other {public} firm on Wall
Street grew by buying somebody else's big producer and paying
him too much money."

   Finds Artful Way
   To Settle a Bad Debt

   Chief to Personally Pay Back
   $1.5 Million Loan Granted
   To an Art-Dealer Friend

   The executive who has suffered through the most
embarrassing annual meeting so far this year is probably Otto
N. Frenzel, chairman and chief executive of Merchants
National Corp.
   The bank holding company disclosed during its meeting
Tuesday that the 59-year-old Indianapolis executive has
agreed to personally pay off about $1.5 million in defaulted
loans that a bank unit made in 1988 to a friend, art dealer
Peg L. Goldberg.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Ms. Goldberg, who had been introduced to the lending
officers by Mr. Frenzel, used the loan to buy four
sixth-century Byzantine mosaics that turned out to have been
taken from the ceiling of a church in North Cyprus.
   A few months after the bank lent the money, Mr. Frenzel
became an investor in the project to resell the mosaics --
portraits of Jesus and the apostles Matthew and James.
   Ms. Goldberg tried to sell the mosaics to the J. Paul
Getty Museum for $20 million. But the mosaics sparked a
landmark case on whether foreign governments can recover
stolen art in a U.S. court. In September, a federal district
judge ruled that the mosaics should be returned to the Greek
Orthodox Church.
   Ms. Goldberg appealed the decision. But she can't sell the
mosaics so she doesn't have the means to pay off the debt.
   Mr. Frenzel, who couldn't be reached for comment, was
cleared by an internal investigation of any wrongdoing. But
he decided to pay off the loan because "it did cause some
embarrassment for the corporation as it was handled by the
news media," a spokesman said.
   Mr. Frenzel, whose annual base salary was listed in the
proxy as $379,300, didn't mention the mosaics during his
speech to shareholders. However, James D. Massey, president,
announced the agreement.
   Mr. Frenzel "wants to put this to rest," the spokesman
said.

   Moody's Weighs
   Downgrading
   Citicorp Debt

   Long, Short Terms Studied;
   Move Could Shake Up
   Nation's Bank System

   NEW YORK -- In a move that could shake the nation's
banking system, Moody's Investors Service Inc. placed the
long-term and, for the first time, the short-term debt of
Citicorp and some units under review for a possible
downgrade.
   A downgrading would affect $31 billion of the parent
company's securities, increasing the company's short-term
cost of funds and dealing a major blow to its prestige.
Importantly, the short-term rating of Citibank, its flagship,
isn't under review.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Citicorp always has been the bank that was `too big to
downgrade.' They were regarded as untouchable," said Ann
Robinson, a bond analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. "If Citicorp is downgraded, it's like saying
that the whole U.S. banking system is being downgraded."
   With $230 billion in assets, Citicorp is the nation's
largest banking company and a bellwether for the banking
industry. Analysts say a downgrading of Citicorp could
intensify investor jitters about banks as a group and cause
them to demand higher yields on bank debt.
   The bond market has treated Citicorp debt, whose senior
debt carries an singleA-1 rating, much more kindly than most
other bank debt. There has been plenty of demand for its
debt, and prices have held up comparatively well at a time
when yields on some bank debt, such as Midlantic Corp., have
climbed to 20%.
   Moody's announcement came after the close of trading. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,
Citicorp common stock fell 21.5 cents to close at $23.75 a
share.
   While ratings reviews don't always result in ratings
changes, some analysts believe that, in the current harsh
regulatory climate for banks, a downgrading of Citicorp is
likely. Moody's, which has been aggressive in downgrading
bank ratings, recently placed obligations of Chase Manhattan
Corp., which has a more conservative risk profile and a
stronger capital base, under review for an upgrade. But
instead of upgrading Chase, it affirmed its existing rating.
   Christopher T. Mahoney, a vice president at Moody's, said
the company was concerned by Citicorp's mounting levels of
nonperforming loans in commercial real estate, highly
leveraged transactions and developing-country loans, as well
as its capital adequacy.
   "We have to take a look in greater depth at their
exposure," said Mr. Mahoney.
   In response, a Citicorp spokesman said, "We trust that
Moody's will agree with us that a change isn't justified."
   Moody's, a unit of Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., last reviewed
Citicorp's rating about two years ago at the height of
concern about developing country-loans. At that time, Moody's
affirmed the holding company's debt rating but downgraded the
bank.
   Citicorp satisfies about 15% of its funding needs through
the commercial paper market and about 10% by issuing longterm
debt. About 60% of its funds come from customer deposits,
which wouldn't be affected by a rating change.
   Citicorp is the biggest lender to commercial real estate,
with a $13 billion portfolio of loans outstanding. The
company is also the biggest lender to highly leveraged
transactions, with $7.9 billion outstanding; and to
developing countries, with $8.6 billion in medium- and
long-term debt.
   In the first quarter, Citicorp's nonperforming assets
climbed 11% from a year earlier to $8.1 billion, while its
reserves to absorb losses have remained about 61%, below the
70% level kept by some other banks. And its common equity, at
3.6% of total assets, is well below the 4% or more of most
peer banks.
   Citicorp has pointed to the global and varied nature of
its business, particularly its strong consumer business, in
arguing why its numbers don't always coincide with industry
norms. And Chairman John S. Reed has adamantly insisted that
he wants to build Citicorp's capital base to 4.5% through
retained earnings and nonstrategic asset sales and not by
issuing new shares, which would dilute existing shareholders.

   The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on
nationwide telephone interviews of 1,001 registered voters
conducted April 11, 12, 14 and 16 by the polling
organizations of Peter Hart and Robert Teeter.
   The sample was drawn from 260 randomly selected geographic
points in the continental U.S. Each region was represented in
proportion to its population. Households were picked by a
method that gave all phone numbers, listed and unlisted, an
equal chance of being included. One registered voter, 18 or
older, was selected from each household by a procedure to
provide the correct number of male and female respondents.
The results of the survey were minimally weighted by income
and race to assure that the poll accurately reflects
registered voters nationwide.

<TEXT>
   Chances are 19 of 20 that if all registered voters in the
U.S. had been surveyed using the same questionnaire, the
findings would differ from these poll results by no more than
3.2 percentage points in either direction. The margin of
error for subgroups would be larger.

   Big Stocks Fall as Investors Leave
   Firms With Unfavorable Earnings

   NEW YORK -- Big stocks tumbled yesterday as investors
moved out of consumer issues and stocks of companies with bad
earnings reports and continued to fret over the sagging bond
market.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.94 to 2711.94,
the second decline in as many days. Stock-index arbitrage
sell programs pushed stocks into steeper losses in late
trading. Volume totaled 152,930,000 shares on the New York
Stock Exchange. That was the most since April 4 when
159,540,000 shares traded, but still below last year's daily
average volume of 165,470,000. Declining issues on the Big
Board outnumbered advancers 968 to 511.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 30-stock Dow Average fell 0.77%, while the New York
Stock Exchange Composite index fell 0.73%. Big consumer and
other non-industrial shares in the Dow average were heaviest
hit.
   Coca-Cola tumbled 1 7/8 to 77 3/8. A "Heard on the Street"
column in this newspaper suggested that shares of Coca-Cola
and PepsiCo are overpriced. Pepsi fell 7/8 to 65 1/2.
   American Express, another stock in the industrial average,
fell 1 1/4 to 27 5/8 on volume of 1.5 million shares.
American Express reported a $1.50 a share loss for the first
quarter, including charges related to the restructuring of
Shearson Lehman Hutton. Shearson Lehman Hutton fell 1/2 to
13.
   Among other big stocks in the Dow average were Procter &amp;
Gamble, down 1 to 69 1/4, and Boeing, off 3/8 to 71 1/8.
   Outside of the Dow industrials, buyers were picking
selectively among secondary issues. "If you look outside
Procter &amp; Gamble, Coke and Boeing, you can easily notice some
demand," said Edward Laux, head of block trading at Kidder
Peabody.
   PPG Industries, for example, rose 1 1/4 to 44 5/8. The
company reported first quarter earnings rose to $1.16 a share
from $1.15 a year earlier, and boosted its quarterly dividend
to 42 cents from 38 cents.
   Yesterday marked a pronounced rotation out of consumer
stocks and into shares of companies whose fortunes are tied
to the pace of economic activity. Among the so-called
cyclical sectors, Ford gained 1/4 to 48 1/4 and General
Motors gained 7/8 to 46 7/8.
   However, a weak bond market continued to rattle stock
investors. The 30-year Treasury bond closed down nearly 1/8
of a point, or almost $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount,
after falling more than one point Wednesday.
   Peter Canelo, investment strategist at Bear Stearns, said
weak bond prices appear to be more of an influence over
stocks at this point than first-quarter earnings reports.
   While overall earnings appear to be down again, Mr. Canelo
said the decline isn't as steep. Quarterly results from a
group of 98 companies tracked by Mr. Canelo show an average
decline of about 7% from a year earlier, compared with a
fourth-quarter drop of about 15%.
   Shares of Comdisco plunged 8 1/2 to close at 18 in Big
Board trading of 2.6 million shares after the company
announced that second-quarter earnings are expected to be as
much as 30% lower than the year-ago period. The volume was 30
times its average daily volume. Analysts had been forecasting
that net for the quarter would be above the 60 cents a share
that the company reported in the year-ago period.
   Comdisco executives called the sharp stock decline an
overreaction by Wall Street. Comdisco attributed the
projected earnings drop to customer jitters over the
impending, yet unknown, introduction date of International
Business Machines' Summit products. This left Comdisco's
customers leary of long-term leases on mainframe computer
equipment, and they instead opted for short-term leases
during the second quarter ended March 31, the company said.
   Silicon Graphics plunged 3 5/8 to 31 3/4 despite reporting
that earnings for the fiscal third quarter, ended last month,
were almost triple the year-ago figures.
   Earnings-related selling also weighed on Reebok
International, which fell 1 1/2 to 17 1/2 on a disappointing
7% increase in its first-quarter earnings; Alaska Air Group
fell 1 1/4 to 23 3/8, Diamond Shamrock declined 3/4 to 24
1/2, and Charles Schwab dropped 5/8 to 15 1/4.
   Conversely, Digital Equipment gained 2 1/8 to 82 1/8 on
1.9 million shares after releasing its earnings for the
fiscal third quarter, ended last month. While its net income
was down 90% from a year earlier -- largely because of a
charge for restructuring -- analysts said the company's
operating results were better than expected.
   Other issues to benefit from strong quarterly earnings
reports included Glenfed, which rose 7/8 to 12 3/4; Oregon
Steel Mills, up 1 3/4 to 37 3/4, and Vista Chemical climbed 1
to 4 1/4 in its second straight session of heavy trading amid
speculation that Thomson of Canada may be interested in
acquiring the company. Harcourt officials weren't available
for comment, while Thomson declined comment.
   Harcourt was the most active New York Stock Exchange issue
on volume of about 2.8 million shares. More than 1.3 million
were traded on Wednesday, when the stock rose 1/4 point. The
company's 12% preferred stock was also active in the latest
session; the stock issue rose to 1/2 to 3 3/8 as 1.5 million
changed hands.
   Dayton Hudson dropped 1 1/4 to 69 1/2 after announcement
of its agreement to acquire the Marshall Field's
department-store chain for about $1.04 billion from Britain's
B.A.T Industries. B.A.T gained 1/16 to 11 7/8 in American
Stock Exchange trading.
   Santa Fe Pacific, which agreed to a $350 million
settlement of litigation regarding an alleged conspiracy to
block construction of a coal-slurry pipeline, climbed 1 5/8
to 21 1/2. A federal court had ordered the company last year
to pay $750.1 million in the case.
   Raychem gained 1 3/8 to 26 3/4. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette raised its investment rating on the stock to "buy"
from "neutral," even though it lowered its estimate of fiscal
1990 earnings to a range of 40 to 50 cents a share from 60
cents.
   Nord Resources dropped 1 to 15 1/8. Shearson Lehman Hutton
lowered its earnings estimate for 1990 by 10 cents a share,
to $1.20, after learning from the company that it hasn't yet
secured any commercial orders for its new high-grade kaolin
products.
   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 2.49
to 350.73. Volume totaled 15,100,000 shares. There were 226
issues advancing and 346 declining.
   Texas Air rose 1/2 to 6 5/8 in the wake of a federal
judge's decision to name a trustee to manage its Eastern
Airlines unit, currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings. The company said it wouldn't appeal the ruling,
which also released $80 million in funds from an escrow
account.
   A.T. Cross Class A slid 1 5/8 to 30 7/8 after estimating
that first-quarter earnings declined 40% and sales fell 8%
from year-earlier levels.

   OTTAWA -- The Canadian government decided to appeal a
Quebec Superior Court ruling that the Competition Tribunal,
which reviews antitrust cases, is unconstitutional.
   The appeal is to be heard by the Quebec Court of Appeal.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The tribunal, which was established four years ago,
reviews cases referred to it by the government's antitrust
agency, the Bureau of Competition Policy.
   The tribunal's powers were challenged by Quebec City-based
Alex Couture Inc., a processor of animal waste products,

   The Superior Court ruled that the tribunal, with members
including judges, economists and business specialists, had
powers that violate constitutional guarantees of fair and
impartial judicial proceedings.

   NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 508 money-market funds
fell $1.25 billion, to $388.60 billion, in the week ended
Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute, a
Washington-based trade association.
   "With short-term interest rates continuing to hold fairly
steady, the overall change in money-market fund assets held
in individual accounts was small," said Jacob Dreyer, vice
president and chief economist at the institute. "Massive
flows of individual tax payments and refunds, typical for
mid-April, also had no discernible effect on money-market
fund assets. On the other hand, money-market fund assets held
in institutional accounts dropped over $1 billion, most
probably in response to an abrupt rise in the federal funds
rate."

   Assets of 246 general-purpose funds fell $467.3 million,

institutional funds fell $1.02 billion, to $90.23 billion.

   MIAMI -- Knight-Ridder Inc. reported that first-quarter
net income climbed 26% to $25.8 million from $20.5 million a
year ago, due in part to lower newsprint and interest costs.
   The giant media concern said per-share profit rose 28% in
the latest quarter to 50 cents from 39 cents, based on 51.8
million shares outstanding in the latest quarter compared
with 52.6 million a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder said revenue rose 2.6% to $554.7 million
from $540.7 million a year earlier.
   The company said reduced losses in its Detroit newspaper
operations and good performance in its Business Information
Services Division, particularly its MoneyCenter and Dialog
products, contributed to the improved results.
   It said interest costs in the quarter fell to $14.1
million from $23 million a year earlier, as a result of the
pay-down of debt with funds from the 1989 sale of eight
television stations and its Pasadena newspaper.
   In a statement, Robert F. Singleton, senior vice president
and chief financial officer, said, "Looking ahead,
Knight-Ridder is well positioned to continue to absorb a soft
advertising environment and should produce among the best
earnings-per-share gains in our industry this year." He added
that "barring some unforeseen financial setback, 1990 will be
Knight-Ridder's 15th consecutive year of growth in earnings
per share from continuing operations."

   A St. Louis developer is suing the Federal National
Mortgage Association, claiming that the agency has declined
to finance projects in a section of North St. Louis because
it is too blighted.
   The suit is the first in the nation against Fannie Mae to
allege redlining, the practice by lenders of rejecting loan
applications in poor neighborhoods. Filed by developer Bruce
Ring, the suit seeks $103.5 million in damages against both
Fannie Mae and First Interstate Mortgage Co. of Illinois, its
local agent in St. Louis.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Fannie Mae is a federally chartered, publicly owned
company that stimulates housing development in poor and
moderate-income neighborhoods by buying mortgages and
refinancing them at reduced rates to qualified developers.
   A Fannie Mae spokesman said this is the first time the
company has been accused of redlining. "Fannie Mae does not
accept or condone or permit redlining in any fashion," said
David Jeffers. "All you have to do is look at our
underwriting standards and see that is something we take very
seriously." The agency says it has provided refinancing for
four projects in North St. Louis.
   Mr. Ring's allegations are being investigated by Sen. John
C. Danforth, (R, Mo.), and Reps. William L. Clay and Richard
A. Gephardt, both Democrats from St. Louis. All three have
asked Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp to
investigate.
   Mr. Ring applied to Fannie Mae through First Interstate
last August to refinance $3.6 million in short-term loans so
he could renovate seven run-down apartment buildings in St.
Louis. Five of the buildings are in the city's depressed
northern section. According to his suit, filed in U.S.
District Court in St. Louis, Fannie Mae rejected the entire
application after a First Interstate assistant vice-president
inspected the properties.
   According to the suit, the bank official described two of
the properties as "pioneer locations," adding that he "would
not personally want to invest in either location." Another
location, he wrote, "definitely had some rough areas within a
few blocks."
   Mr. Ring is asking for $100 million in punitive damages
plus $3.5 million, which he says is the difference between
his aggregate mortgage payments over 35 years through
conventional financing and the 8.1% rate available through
Fannie Mae.
   Pretrial hearings in Mr. Ring's suit are scheduled for
April 27.

   COMPANIES MUST DISCLOSE shaky finances to some applicants,
a Colorado court rules.
   An employer may not have to divulge its financial
condition to every job applicant it interviews, the Colorado
Court of Appeals said. But full disclosure is required if a
company has made statements to an applicant that would create
a "false impression" about its outlook and the applicant's
future employment prospects.
   The decision earlier this month upheld a jury's award of
$250,000 in damages to Roberta Berger, who had sued Security
Pacific Information Services Inc. for fraudulent concealment
arising out of her hiring and termination by the Denver
company.
   Ms. Berger was recruited by the company, and had moved
from New Orleans to Denver to accept a job in January 1986.
She was terminated some eight months later, after the
computer project she had been hired to manage was
discontinued. Ms. Berger contended that in interviews for the
job, Security Pacific Information had presented a positive
picture of the company and her future, concealing its
financial losses and the "substantial, known risk" that her
project might soon be abandoned.
   The appeals court upheld a jury award that included nearly
$92,000 in actual damages, covering lost earnings and losses
on the sale of a house Ms. Berger bought in Denver. Punitive
damages made up the balance of the award.
   Andrew T. Brake, a Denver attorney who represented Ms.
Berger, noted that Colorado is a state that permits employers
under certain conditions to terminate a worker without cause
under a so-called employment-at-will law.
   Attorneys for Security Pacific Information couldn't be
reached for comment.

   CHIEF ATTORNEY IN AT&amp;T antitrust litigation will open his
own law firm.
   George L. Saunders Jr., a partner with the Chicago law
firm of Sidley &amp; Austin, is leaving the firm in June to open
his own law firm. He hopes to recruit a small group of
"older, successful lawyers" who want to leave big-firm
practice, he says.
   Mr. Saunders, 58 years old, is not taking any business
with him, including American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., the
client that brought him national attention. Mr. Saunders was
AT&amp;T's lead trial counsel in the long-running antitrust
litigation brought by the Justice Department and MCI
Communications Corp. that led to the breakup of the Bell
System.
   H. Blair White, a Sidley &amp; Austin partner, says he was
surprised Mr. Saunders decided to leave after 28 years at the
firm. "It's a very ambitious thing to do in your career at
that point," Mr. White says. Sidley partner Howard J.
Trienens said Mr. Saunders has been frustrated by having to
turn away some business because of conflict-of-interest
problems with other clients of the law firm.
   Mr. Saunders says he has long contemplated the move.
"Maybe you could call it a midlife crisis," he says.

   JUDGE CLEARS THE WAY for lawsuit accusing Exxon and Conoco
of rigging oil prices.
   In federal court in Manhattan, Judge William Conner
rejected the oil companies' motions to dismiss the suit,
which was filed in 1986 by Transnor Ltd., an oil trader based
in Bermuda. The suit accuses Exxon Corp., Conoco Inc. and a
Conoco subsidiary of conspiring to depress certain crude oil
prices in order to evade taxes in Britain. It seeks damages
totaling about $261 million, stemming from losses Transnor
says it suffered because of the lower prices.
   Transnor accused the companies of forcing down the price
of Brent oil, a widely traded North Sea crude oil, by selling
cargoes of the oil at below-market prices. Transnor had
bought two cargoes of Brent oil, but then refused to accept
delivery after the market value plunged. Transnor alleges
that after forcing the oil prices down, the oil companies
were able to use a trading technique know as tax spinning to
increase profit margins on the refined oil products. Britain
taxes refinery profits at a lower rate than crude oil
profits.
   Exxon and Conoco argued that the case should be thrown out
on several grounds -- including their claim that a conspiracy
is unlikely because they would have hurt themselves by
depressing oil prices. Judge Conner, however, said it is
plausible that the alleged pricing scheme's tax benefits and
other advantages could have offset the companies' lower crude
oil revenue.
   The oil companies, which previously have said the suit is
without merit, also claimed that the case should be dismissed
because the Brent oil market is an international market. They
argued that a U.S. court has no jurisdiction in such
disputes. But Judge Conner said that most of the trading in
oil contracts is done in New York and Boston.
   A spokesman for Exxon said the company was disappointed
that Judge Conner refused to dismiss the case. Officials at
Conoco, a unit of Du Pont Co., couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Edward Swan, an attorney for Transnor, said the trial is
set to begin May 21.

   BASKIN FLAHERTY suffers Pittsburgh defections.
   Half the members of the Pittsburgh office of Baskin
Flaherty Elliott &amp; Mannino, a Philadelphia-based regional law
firm, have resigned, including name partner and former
Chairman Philip Baskin.
   Mr. Baskin left last week. About 15 of Baskin Flaherty's
32 lawyers in Pittsburgh also have left to begin their own
firm. All of the defections took place amid rumors of
dissatisfaction over the direction of the firm.
   Baskin Flaherty is developing a more specialized practice
in complex litigation, financial services, health law and
environmental law, said the firm's President Edward F.
Mannino, who specializes in banking litigation, and John M.
Elliott, also a name partner.
   The Pittsburgh office, said Mr. Elliott, was more oriented
toward less sophisticated litigation in domestic relations,
personal injury and real estate, which Mr. Elliott said were
not compatible with the firm's goals.
   "It's a question of how you emphasize things," said Mr.
Baskin. "We happen to think that while the new area is very
important and should be properly addressed, you don't throw
the old things out, too."
   Baskin Flaherty is currently filling the positions and
opening a seven-lawyer office in Washington D.C.
   In Pittsburgh, meanwhile, the firm recently hired Charles
Sheehey, former U.S. attorney for the Western District of
Pennsylvania, as head of that office's litigation department.

ALUMINUM (ALU)
EARNINGS (ERN)
</IN>
<LP>
   NEW YORK -- Amax Inc., hurt by a softening economy and
sharply lower prices for aluminum ingot and some aluminum
products, posted a 56% drop in first-quarter net income.
   The company, which has interests in domestic energy and
gold production as well as aluminum and manufactured aluminum
products, said net income in the first quarter fell to $50
million, or 57 cents a share, from $114.2 million, or $1.34 a
share, a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Sales fell 5.3%, to $927.9 million, from $979.6 million.
   Allen Born, chairman, chief executive and president, said
a softening of the economy that began in the 1989 third
quarter reduced demand and prices for aluminum ingot and some
aluminum products from the prices a year earlier. Mr. Born
said first-quarter prices for primary aluminum were about 40%
lower than a year ago.
   Mr. Born said, however, there had been some recent
strengthening of demand, reflected in prices for some
aluminum products and aluminum ingot. The average price per
pound of aluminum ingot is currently about 72 cents, slightly
better than the 69 cents in the first three months of this
year, although still lower than the year-earlier first
quarter, when the price was about $1.
   Andrew Silver, an analyst at Dillon, Read &amp; Co., said
Amax's results were stronger than he expected. "The company
is on track for a respectable performance in a somewhat
difficult environment," he said. The analyst is predicting a
modest improvement for earnings in the second quarter based
on somewhat higher aluminum prices, and estimates earnings of
$2.50 a share for the year. He said the diversity of Amax's
operations helped results during a soft cycle for aluminum,
with about 40% of the company's earnings coming from
non-aluminum activity.
   Mr. Born said lower prices for primary ingot, as well as
higher raw-material costs, were partly offset by higher
shipments of semi-fabricated goods and stronger performance
in the company's architectural and building aluminum
products.
   The official also noted improvements in the energy and
gold businesses, with Amax Coal contributing $29 million to
operating earnings, up from $20 million a year earlier. Oil
and gas earnings rose 20% to $6 million.
   "As the year progresses," Mr. Born said, "we expect the
economy to strengthen and Amax's businesses and earnings to
improve above present levels."
   Amax has been a rumored takeover target in recent weeks.
Mr. Silver, the analyst, said that Amax, as the third-largest
aluminum producer and the third-largest coal producer in the
U.S., has "very attractive" assets, which he estimates could
be valued at $35 to $40 a share.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Amax shares closed at $25, down 87.5 cents.

   Two paper-producing concerns, Bowater Inc. and Union Camp
Corp., posted first-quarter profit declines of 43% and 15%,
respectively, reflecting heavy price discounting.
   Bowater, a newsprint producer based in Darien, Conn., had
net income of $22.2 million, or 59 cents a share, down from
$38.9 million, or $1.04 a share. Sales declined 5.7% to
$338.3 million from $358.7 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The newsprint, coated-paper and pulp segments were hurt by
increased price discounting, Bowater said. It added that
operating costs were higher because of continued start-up
expenses at several mills and the temporary shutdown of a
newsprint machine at its Nova Scotia mill.
   Bowater said earnings for the rest of the year will
largely depend on how newsprint and market pulp are affected
by the U.S. and world economies, the relative strength of the
dollar and the success of a price increase effective June 1.
   At Union Camp, Wayne, N.J., first-quarter net income fell
to $67.4 million, or 98 cents a share, from $79.7 million, or
$1.16 a share, a year earlier. Sales slipped to $701.5
million from $706.2 million.
   Gene Cartledge, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the results reflected lower prices for linerboard and
uncoated business paper.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Bowater
closed at $25.50, down 37.5 cents, and Union Camp closed at
$37.375, unchanged.

   LOS ANGELES -- The cost of a biography is rising at
Occidental Petroleum Corp., where shareholders are financing
Volume 2 of Chairman Armand Hammer's exploits.
   According to proxy material, the Los Angeles-based oil and
chemical company spent $195,000 last year on the book's
ghostwriting, bringing total outlays for the project to
$450,000 at year end. Occidental said it's committed to at
least an additional $30,000 plus expenses for the volume.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A company spokesman said the manuscript, which is as yet
untitled, has been completed. Publication is expected later
this year.
   The 91-year-old Dr. Hammer has co-authored the new volume
with Neil Lyndon, a British author with whom he wrote the
1987 tome "Hammer." Occidental has received $680,000 in
royalties from that book, apparently less than the company
advanced for its writing.
   Volume 2, said the proxy material, "will describe Dr.
Hammer's world-wide endeavors since {1987} in international
affairs, art and other philanthropic concerns, as well as
significant domestic and international business activities of
Occidental."
   The latest work will be Dr. Hammer's fourth
autobiographical installment, the earliest of which was
penned in the 1930s, with a second volume in 1975.
   An unauthorized biography by journalist Steve Weinberg,
published last year in the U.S. by Little, Brown &amp; Co., takes
a somewhat darker view of Dr. Hammer than the
corporate-financed volumes. Dr. Hammer has launched an
elaborate legal action in England against Mr. Weinberg and
the book's British publisher, alleging that under that
country's narrower libel laws the book defames him.

   Great American Bank disclosed that its underperforming
assets jumped 42% in the fourth quarter, contributing to its
previously reported net loss for the period and casting a
pall over the thrift's survival plans.
   On Dec. 31, Great American reported underperforming assets
of $645.6 million, compared with $453.4 million on Sept. 30,
according to a regulatory filing with the Office of Thrift
Supervision. The company's total "classified" assets, a
broader measure of actual or potential loan problems, rose
59% to $1.30 billion from $814.6 million at Sept. 30, the
filing said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The increases help explain the $198.9 million, or $8.30 a
share, net loss that the company reported on Tuesday for the
fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with year-earlier
profit of $19.8 million, or 80 cents. The capital-consuming
effect of the deficit, and other problems, has left San
Diego-based Great American, the nation's eighth-largest
thrift with $15.9 billion in assets, on the verge of having
to sell or dismantle itself or face possible federal seizure.
   On Tuesday, Great American said it was making provision
for loan and foreclosed real-estate losses of $271.2 million,
but declined to specify the size of its troubled-loan
portfolio. According to the OTS filing, the company had loss
reserves on Dec. 31 equal to about 19% of its underperforming
assets, excluding previous write-downs, and had set aside
reserves or taken write-downs equal to about 35% of its total
troubled assets.
   Analysts said the growth in troubled assets, largely
reflecting a disastrous 1986 acquisition of an Arizona
thrift, will complicate Great American's efforts to save
itself. At year-end, according to the filing, roughly 23% of
the thrift's total $2.6 billion of assets in Arizona were
considered real or potential trouble. The company must raise
$350 million in new capital by year-end as part of a
regulator-approved plan unveiled earlier this week to comply
with minimum federal capital standards.
   A Great American spokesman said the company considers its
loss reserves to be adequate. He added: "We are still
discussing the bank with a number of qualified investors, and
are proceeding with our operations according to our capital
plan."
   The three biggest California banks -- BankAmerica Corp.,
Security Pacific Corp., and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. -- are
interested in expanding in the lucrative San Diego market and
are considered potential bidders for Great American.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Great American slipped 37.5 cents to $3.625.

partners for participation in a similar operation in New
Zealand.
   The Argentinian government has said it will split its
telecommunications concern into two parts, covering the north
and south of the country and parts of Buenos Aires, and sell
each to private bidders. It has invited companies interested
in submitting bids to present applications this month.
   Mexico and Puerto Rico have indicated they will privatize
their telecommunications services, though they haven't
announced details. New Zealand, meanwhile, is considering
privatizing its telecommunications services, Mr. Used said,
though he declined to elaborate.
   Earlier this month, Telefonica completed its $388 million
purchase of a controlling stake in CTC from Bond Corp.
International Ltd. It also recently bought an additional 10%
of Entel, of which it had already had 10%, for $23 million
from a vendor representing the Chilean armed forces.
   CTC, which controls most of Chile's internal
telecommunications, had profit last year of $95 million on
revenue of $268 million, Mr. Used said. Telefonica will own
43.7% of CTC's shares, once a pending capital restructuring
operation is concluded.
   Entel, which operates Chile's intercity and international
links, limits the maximum holding in its shares by any holder
to 20%. But Mr. Used said Telefonica has approached other
Entel holders to discuss the possibility of raising this
limit to 40%. If this is approved, he said, Telefonica may
seek to acquire the 10% Entel holding owned by Banco
Santander of Spain, as well as shares from other potential
vendors.

   SPRING VALLEY, N.Y. -- Par Pharmaceutical Inc. named Elie
G. Shami senior vice president for scientific affairs and
quality.
   Mr. Shami also was named to the board, filling a vacancy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Shami, who has a doctorate in physical pharmacy, has
held senior positions in pharmaceutical companies and most
recently was in research and development at Orlove Group, a
closely held Fort Lauderdale, Fla., generic-drug company. Mr.
Shami also will oversee quality and scientific affairs at
Par's Quad Pharmaceuticals unit. In late March, Quad halted
distribution of all products subject to federal approval.
   Par, a generic-drug concern under federal investigation,
also reiterated its commitment to the requirements of good
manufacturing practices and compliance with its approved
product applications. It issued a voluntary declaration
providing for comprehensive and continuous reviews of its
practices.
   In addition to the specific commitments outlined in the
declaration, Par said its president is required to certify to
the Food and Drug Administration that the company is in
substantial compliance with the declaration.
   The declaration is expected to facilitate Par's
reintroduction of products that remain under a voluntary
distribution moratorium Par imposed last August. Since then,
the company has reintroduced about 50% of its products, a
spokesman said.

   Santa Fe Pacific
   Settles ETSI Case
   For $350 Million
   ----

   CHICAGO -- Santa Fe Pacific Corp., operating the past year
under the cloud of a court judgment that it pay $750 million
to a pipeline joint venture, settled the case for $350
million.
   A settlement with Energy Transportation Systems Inc. had
been far from certain. In addition, the final figure came in
well below the $400 million to $450 million analysts expected
would be required to extricate Santa Fe from the huge
judgment, which was the result of an unfavorable ruling in an
antitrust case.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Santa Fe shares jumped $1.75 to close at $21.625, on volume
of nearly 900,000 shares.
   Not only was the settlement "smart, it was imperative,"
said First Boston Corp. analyst Graeme Lidgerwood, who added
that Santa Fe has been "basically blocked" from progressing
with its restructuring plans "until they could put the ETSI
litigation behind them."
   The settlement, combined with accelerated royalties
received under a recent agreement that resolved a separate
long-running lawsuit filed by Texas Utilities Co., resulted
in an after-tax first-quarter charge of $115 million, Santa
Fe said; yesterday the company reported a net loss of $61.4
million, or 39 cents a share.
   Under the agreement, the four ETSI partners will receive
$150 million in cash "as early as June 1," with a promissory
note for the balance. Santa Fe will pay $25 million in 1991
and 1992, and $30 million in each of five succeeding years.
   The partners of the failed, Houston-based joint venture
will sell the promissory note, rather than wait for the
payments. In a release, the companies said Enron Corp. and
Panhandle Eastern Corp. will each receive, after deduction of
legal fees, $69 million in pretax proceeds. K N Energy Inc.,
with a lesser stake in the failed venture, will receive about
$47 million. The fourth member, a unit of closely held
Bechtel Group Inc., with an indicated stake roughly similar
to K N Energy's, didn't disclose what it will receive.
   In the 1980s, ETSI had planned to construct a coal-slurry
pipeline linking the coal beds of Wyoming to Oklahoma and
Texas. The project was never built, and the venture
subsequently sued a number of railroads -- which profit from
hauling coal to the region's utilities -- for allegedly
conspiring to block the project. Santa Fe was the only
defendant that didn't settle the antitrust lawsuit before
trial.
   Last year, after a federal judge ruled against Santa Fe,
the company ended up owing adjusted damages of $750 million.
Although it had appealed the judgment, it signaled repeatedly
that it would be amenable to a settlement.
   "We continue to believe that we are innocent of the
charges in the ETSI case," said Santa Fe's chairman,
president and chief executive officer, Robert D. Krebs. But
the settlement, he said, is "the prudent course to follow in
view of the previous court action and the uncertainty and
cost of the appeal and retrial process."
   First Boston's Ms. Lidgerwood noted that the spread out
payments called for under the settlement will help the
company's cash flow. The company this summer probably will
replace the $780 million in payment-in-kind debentures it
issued under a 1988 recapitalization, she said. The timetable
for the planned spin-off of the company's 80%-owned
real-estate operation, and the unannounced but widely
expected spinoff of its energy unit, may advance as a result
of the settlement, she noted.

   The Stoughton, Mass., footwear concern said U.S. sales of
Reebok footwear grew about 2% during the current quarter.
   The company said sales increases at its Rockport and
Ellesse divisions and the addition of sales of its Boston
Whaler division, acquired last October, were "largely" offset
by a decrease in sales at its Avia unit.
   A company spokesman said sales for Avia were $48.2 million
in the latest quarter, down 26%, from $64.9 million in the
year-ago period.
   He said the Avia segment, under new management since last
year, "needed focusing" and has had to be "positioned to a
point from which it can grow." He declined to predict the
group's annual sales, which totaled $196.2 million last year.
   He said the unit is now concentrating on "pure atheletic"
shoes.

   Tandy Corp. said its net income declined about 20% for the

more than a year recorded a 4% sales gain during the period.

   For the third quarter, Tandy said it had net income of $53
million, or 67 cents a share, compared to $66.7 million, or
75 cents a share, last year. Revenue rose 7.4% to $1.01
billion from $943.7 million last year. The company had about
79.6 million shares outstanding at March 31, reflecting a
10-million shares buy-back during calendar 1989.
   It was the second consecutive quarter that Tandy's
earnings per share had dropped below year-ago levels "and
hopefully the last," said a spokesman.
   The company said its introduction of more expensive
computer models and the growth of its cellular telephone
business were bright spots during the quarter.

   Campeau's Proposal
   To Defer Payments

   TORONTO -- National Bank of Canada said it would support a
Campeau Corp. proposal to defer its interest payments on 184
million Canadian dollars (US$158.4 million) of 7% convertible
debentures.
   Andre Berard, president and chief executive officer of
National Bank, said he would agree to an interest-payment
deferral for Campeau because the troubled retailer is
"basically sound" and needs time to restructure its finances.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I will agree to any decent proposal that is to give those
people the time and the freedom to restructure and do a
better job," Mr. Berard said after a luncheon speech here.
   Montreal-based National Bank holds C$60.4 million of the 7
1/2% debentures. It registered them under its name in January
along with other Campeau securities when Campeau's chairman,
Robert Campeau, defaulted on personal loans by missing
interest payments on C$153 million of debt.
   Campeau missed interest payments last month on its two
series of convertible debentures. At a special meeting June
1, Campeau will ask holders of its 7 1/2% debentures to waive
defaults triggered by the missed payments until Dec. 31,
1991.
   National Bank has a 35% fully diluted voting stake in
Campeau and two seats on its board. Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd., the real estate concern owned by Toronto's
Reichmann family, holds C$46.6 million of the 7 1/2%
debentures and all of Campeau's US$260 million of 7%
convertible debentures. Sources close to Olympia &amp; York
previously said the Reichmanns likely would be willing to
support an interest-payment deferral on the debentures.
   National Bank's Mr. Berard said Campeau's Canadian
properties and its U.S. retailing units, Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., are high quality assets
even though Federated and Allied are in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings and the real estate assets largely are pledged as
collateral for loans.
   "I think if we take the time, if we compromise, if we
support a restructuring of that group, we'll end up better
three years down the road than we are today," Mr. Berard
said.
   As for Mr. Campeau's personal financial problems stemming
from the bankruptcy-law filing of Federated and Allied and
the subsequent plunge in Campeau's stock price, Mr. Berard
said the situation was "difficult." He declined to say
whether the bank would seek a court order in Ontario enabling
it to seize Mr. Campeau's personal assets.
   Mr. Campeau is facing a C$50 million lawsuit from National
Bank and a C$12.5 million lawsuit from Bank of Nova Scotia
related to defaults on his personal loans. Last week, Bank of
Montreal obtained a court order requiring Mr. Campeau to
repay C$26.7 million outstanding in a personal loan. The
order could entitle the bank to seize Mr. Campeau's personal
assets.

   Pulitzer Publishing Co., citing lower profit at its

   NEW YORK -- The dollar dropped almost one yen yesterday on
continuing sentiment that the U.S. unit was overbought at its
recent levels near 160 yen. The move continued the dollar's
slide against the yen that began Wednesday.
   But the dollar strengthened against the mark in the wake
of strong mark-selling for yen. The effects of the heavy
selling of the West German currency against its Japanese
counterpart spread to benefit the U.S. unit as well.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The dollar staged a rebound after hitting its intraday low
of 156.20 yen. But the recovery was seen by the traders as
only a temporary reprieve from the day's move toward a
stronger yen. The dollar finished mostly higher against other
currencies.
   Some traders attributed the yen's broad strength to a move
by Japanese investors back into the Tokyo stock market and
out of dollar-denominated investments.
   In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock index surged for the second
straight day, ending 696.35 points higher at 29,945.41, a
gain of 2.38%. The index rose 787.46 points on Wednesday.
   "Capital flows are dictating the course of the market" as
the Japanese take money home to support their own securities
markets, said Susan Babcock, vice president of corporate
foreign exchange at Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp. in New
York.
   After the recent steep loss of value in Japanese stocks,
the low prices are attracting investors once again, weakening
the dollar and the mark as the Japanese reduce the amount of
their U.S. and West German investments, Ms. Babcock said.
   Rumors Wednesday that the Japanese Ministry of Finance is
encouraging insurance companies to restrict their investments
in dollar-denominated assets continued to have an impact on
trading yesterday. Traders said the dollar's losses began
with selling early in the global day in Tokyo.
   A rush to liquidate long-mark positions against the yen --
which began in Tokyo -- accelerated during the European day,
bringing the mark down from 94.30 yen at the end of Tokyo
trading to 93.35 yen at the end of trading in London.
   The mark rebounded somewhat against the yen later in the
U.S., ending at 93.67 yen, down from 94.58 yen late Wednesday
in New York.
   The sell-off of the mark against the Japanese currency was
the major source of support for the dollar against the West
German unit in otherwise lethargic dollar-mark trading, said
Morris Armstrong, vice president and foreign exchange manager
at Girozentrale Vienna in New York.
   For the time being, participants are concentrating more on
the yen's value against the mark and the dollar than on the
U.S. currency's rate against the mark, Mr. Armstrong said.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6784 marks, up from 1.6722 marks late Wednesday, and at
157.20 yen, down from 158.10 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6455, up from $1.6392 Wednesday.
   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at
156.95 yen, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 157.75 yen.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6785 marks.
   Remarks made yesterday by Treasury officials expressing
support for the yen were seen by traders as resulting from
concern that the weak yen could hurt efforts to reduce the
size of the U.S. trade gap with Japan, and also from worries
that Japanese investors might stay away from an important
Treasury refunding operation in May if the dollar is too
strong.
   David Mulford, the Treasury's undersecretary for
international affairs, said yesterday that the recent
depreciation of the yen poses "important risks" for the world
economy. And Thomas Dallara, assistant Treasury secretary,
stated that continued yen weakness against the dollar could
damage the effort to reduce global trade imbalances.
   The remarks followed the release Wednesday of the
Treasury's report to Congress on exchange rates. The report
also said the yen's fall against the dollar is a matter of
concern for the U.S.
   But Hongkong &amp; Shanghai's Ms. Babcock said the statements
by the U.S. officials had little importance. "With the yen
already correcting, {the U.S.} might as well make a show of
looking supportive" of the Japanese, she said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar finished at 157.75 yen, down sharply
from 159.87 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo in moderate,
technical dealings.
   In European dealings, the dollar ended mostly lower
against the major currencies in active trading, a reflection
of a resurgent yen and a rush to take some profits.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery rose $1.20 to $377.30 an ounce. Estimated volume was
a moderate 2.5 million ounces.
   In Hong Kong Friday, gold opened at $377.89 an ounce.

68 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Separately, the nation's fifth-largest thrift, based in

said it increased its tangible and risk-based capital to a
level that continues to exceed more-stringent capital

   In the 1989 first quarter, Textron had net income of $63.3

   B.F. Dolan, chairman and chief executive officer of the
aerospace, commercial products and financial services
concern, said, "Textron's balanced diversity has enabled us
to achieve a good start on the year, despite softness in
several of our markets."
   Mr. Dolan said continued strength in the company's finance

slowdown in its automotive divisions.
   Total revenue in Textron's Aerospace Technology sector,
its largest business segment, rose about 2% to $825.9

   Politics &amp; Policy:
   Dole and Others
   In GOP Exchange
   Criticism on Israel

   WASHINGTON -- Republican divisions over U.S. policy toward
Israel broke into the open in an unusual exchange of testy
letters between Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole and
younger conservatives in the House GOP leadership.
   In recent months, Mr. Dole has been increasingly outspoken
in challenging U.S. aid to Israel, and the tension yesterday
reflected a growing concern among Republicans that the
harshness of his tone is hurting the party going into the
fall elections. The Kansas senator said it was "bunk" for his
critics to paint him as "anti-Israel." But among his own
Jewish backers, his published comments during a recent trip
to the Mideast has provoked concern.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "He's not only hurt himself, but he's hurt his party,"
said a past Jewish contributor to Mr. Dole. "I think his
remarks are mean-spirited."
   The flurry of letters yesterday pitted Mr. Dole most
directly against House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich. And the
conservative support for Israel reflects an alliance that
grew stronger under the Reagan administration. The 1988 GOP
platform was striking in its support of pro-Israel positions,
and even as the Bush administration and Secretary of State
James Baker have signaled a shift in policy, conservatives
have sought to build on ties to Jerusalem and Jewish
contributors at home.
   "We firmly support our party's platform," said Mr.
Gingrich in a letter signed by himself and three other
members of the House leadership. "For this reason, we take
issue with your statements on aid to Israel and the status of
Jerusalem."
   Rep. Vin Weber (R., Minn.), who also signed the letter and
is expected to move soon into the House Republican campaign
structure, said, "Bush and Baker have taken a different
approach and that has caused some uneasiness. What Dole is
doing is far more destructive."
   While Mr. Dole has won praise for his willingness to
question the pro-Israel lobby, he has hurt himself by seeming
to reverse his positions from one month to the next. His
initial proposal to impose a 5% cut in foreign aid to Israel
and other major recipient countries appeared hastily
prepared, and came even as he was signaling support for new
aid to help build housing for Soviet Jews in Israel. He has
since moved away from a proposal to help finance such
housing. And after being among the first sponsors last month
of a pro-Israel resolution calling for a unified Jerusalem,
he now says the legislation is harmful to peace in the region
and his own support of it was a mistake.
   Mindful of the House criticism, Senate GOP Whip Alan
Simpson (R., Wyo.) rose last night to defend Mr. Dole, who
said in turn that he would match his record on Israel against
that of any other member of Congress. But the Kansas
Republican and former presidential hopeful is described as
resentful that he didn't receive more financial support from
Jewish contributors in the past. More recently, Mr. Dole was
angered when pro-Israel forces -- in alliance with the
Turkish lobby -- helped to undercut his efforts to win
passage of a resolution commemorating the Armenian massacres.
And he has portrayed the leadership of the pro-Israel lobby
as shortsighted and selfish.
   In January, when Mr. Dole first proposed redistributing
foreign aid, Mr. Gingrich praised him for showing "great
courage." As a postscript to his own letter, the senator
needled the Georgia conservative yesterday by reminding him
of his praise then. "Weren't those words for public
consumption?" asked Mr. Dole of Mr. Gingrich.

   Marty Shugrue Has
   Background Needed
   To Save Eastern Air

   Former Pan Am Executive
   Had Tried to Turnaround
   Continental Airlines

   Maybe Marty Shugrue's business card should read "Troubled
Airlines My Specialty."
   Mr. Shugrue started yesterday as bankruptcy
court-appointed trustee of Eastern Airlines with stints at
financially strapped Pan American Airways and Continental
Airlines already on his resume.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   His latest job, de facto chief executive officer of
Eastern, undoubtedly tops the list of the toughest in the
airline industry at the moment. Mr. Shugrue must rebuild the
anemic Texas Air Corp. unit that has been decimated by a
lengthy machinists strike and resulting Chapter 11 filing and
that has lost the confidence of travelers, especially
business passengers essential to profitability. U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland gave Mr. Shugrue the job
after finding the management at Eastern and its parent
"unfit" to operate the carrier.
   "I have received strong pledges of cooperation from
Eastern Airlines' management, the creditors' committee and
Texas Air," Mr. Shugrue said in a statement. The veteran
airline executive didn't return numerous phone calls.
   A former associate of Mr. Shugrue believes the court
picked the right man for the job. "Marty fits the bill real
well," said Donald Garvett, a former Pan Am vice president.
"He understands and respects people," but he also is "a man
of action who gets things done and makes hard decisions when
he has to."
   Mr. Garvett credits Mr. Shugrue with shoring up travel
agent support for Pan Am, cutting costs, retaining the
respect of labor and keeping good managers during tough
times. "Part of the reason Pan Am is in business today stems
from things Marty could accomplish under difficult
circumstances."
   Mr. Shugrue, 49 years old, has yet to effect a clear-cut
airline turnaround, however. After some 20 years at Pan Am,
in jobs ranging from pilot to vice chairman, he was fired
following a showdown with other board members over Pan Am's
future. He left that carrier in January 1988 when it was
still mired in financial difficulties.
   He landed at Continental Airlines, another Texas Air unit,
as that carrier's fifth president in as many years. Industry
executives and analysts had heralded the much needed
operating experience in marketing, personnel and
adminstration he brought to Continental.
   But he, too, was in for a short tenure, apparently not
correcting Continental's lackluster performance quickly
enough to suit Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo, who brought
in another executive over Mr. Shugrue, prompting him to
resign in February 1989 after a year in the post.
   Mr. Shugrue's appointment Wednesday isn't his first brush
with Eastern. A year ago, he was affiliated with the
investment group led by former baseball commissioner Peter V.
Ueberroth that negotiated to buy Eastern. The deal ultimately
collapsed, and Mr. Shugrue returned to his Houston-based
consulting business.

dividend," said Joseph F. Paquette Jr., chairman and chief
executive officer. The company said its annual earnings will
reduced by about $1 a share; in 1989, it earned $590 million,
or $2.36 a share. It also will incur this year a one-time
charge of about $255 million, or about $1.20 a share, to
write off the part of its Limerick No. 2 investment that it
won't allowed to recover through its rate base.

   Marciulionis Has a Struggle
   With Game and Culture;
   `I Am . . . Not a Russian'

   OAKLAND, Calif. -- Sarunas Marciulionis, the National
Basketball Association's first Soviet import, gazes calmly
into the television lights just after picking up 15 points to
help his team win big in its final home game on Wednesday.
   A man with an accent pokes a microphone toward him and
asks if he has any words for his "many Latino fans." Without
hesitation, he smiles confidently for the cameras and says:
"Sure. Gracias."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Flashback to last fall, when such smoothness was not
evident: Mr. Marciulionis slumps on a chair for medical
treatment after a lousy game, his English thick-tongued
although the sound slipping through his clenched teeth
translates easily enough: "Arrrghh]" He has an ugly gash on
right wrist and a scarlet hook of welts on his left bicep.
Two wires run from a flashing electronic box to his neck,
pulsing with current to relieve muscle spasms. (That injury
resulted from a collision with American culture rather than
with an American opponent: He hurt his neck twisting suddenly
to catch something on one of his three color-TV sets.)
   "You look like a robot," chortles Manute Bol, his
7-foot-7-inch teammate. "Mr. Neck," quips another. "Welcome
to the National Basketball Association, baby," gibes a third.
   The national in this case is a 25-year-old Lithuanian, who
has gone from stardom on the Soviet team to being an average
substitute guard in the NBA. But he has come a long way since
his historic season began last October.
   In one of the more intriguing glasnostic sidelights, Mr.
Marciulionis became the first Soviet athlete ever permitted
by Soviet authorities to play for an American professional
team in a genuine, born-in-the-USA sport. After years of
delicate negotiations and false starts, Mr. Marciulionis
(pronounced Marsh-a-LOAN-us) signed a three-year contract
with the Golden State Warriors at $1.3 million a year. He
gets to keep 60%; Soviet authorities get the rest.
   Mr. Marciulionis's season has been complicated by events
back home, as Lithuania attempts to secede from the Soviet
Union. At his first press conference, the first words out of
his mouth were: "I am a Lithuanian, not a Russian." He is a
nationalist, rooting for independence but worrying about his
family and friends. "Lithuanians must be free," he says.
"Gorbachev must understand this. The wall is down. The Poles
are free. I think Lithuania will be free too, but I worry."
   After the Warriors final game Sunday, Mr. Marciulionis
intends to go back to Lithuania. The Warriors don't want him
to go; they're afraid he might not be able to get back out to
rejoin the team.
   Over the course of the season, Mr. Marciulionis has had
some awful games and some good games (zero points against the
Los Angeles Lakers in March; 33 points against the Orlando
Magic in January), averaging 12 points a game. His coach has
gone from early-season raves about his play to a rather
tepid, "He's done a nice job, but he's got a tremendous
amount to learn."
   All things considered, Mr. Marciulionis says, "it's been a
crazy time."
   Mr. Marciulionis is the leader of a fast break by East
bloc basketball stars toward America, land of the free throw
and home of the wave. It is all part of the
internationalization of professional sports.
   Six Soviet hockey stars have arrived this year to play in
the National Hockey League. One defected in order to play,
which may help explain why the others were given permission
to skate. There is even talk of young Soviet and East bloc
hotshots attending and playing for American colleges, though
some might have to take pay cuts to come here.
   A few deep thinkers perceive serious geopolitical
implications in the sporting world's Westward tilt. The
returns coming in as the NBA season winds down suggest the
main implication for basketball is a potentially vast source
of new talent, amusing spectacle and truly great names.
   Aside from Mr. Marciulionis, there is Zarko Paspalj
(pronounced PAZ-pie), a gabby Yugoslavian on the San Antonio
Spurs who chain-smokes Marlboros, eats at least one Pizza Hut
Supreme a day and says he wants to open the first Pizza Hut
in Yugoslavia. His talking outshines his playing: He is
averaging 2.6 points a game.
   Teammates of Aleksander Volkov, the Atlanta Hawks's
Ukranian power forward, instantly nicknamed him "Gym," short
for "Gym rat," because of his diligent after-hours
practicing. Mr. Volkov (pronounced VOHL-cough) kept asking
why his teammates were calling him "Jim" when Al was just as
easy to pronounce.
   The Los Angeles Lakers drafted Vlade Divac (pronounced
DEE-vash), a 7-footer whose NBA future was briefly clouded by
the subsequent draft by another squad: the Yugoslavian army.
An accommodation was made so Mr. Divac could serve as a
back-up Lakers center rather than a first-string Yugoslavian
grunt, and he has become one of the Lakers's most valuable
substitutes. In all, there are five Eastern European players
in the NBA this year.
   They seem to be catching on to the American game, on
court, off court -- and in court. The owners of Jugoplastika,
a Yugoslavian team sponsored by a plastics conglomerate, sued
the Boston Celtics successfully in federal court to prevent
the Celts from spiriting away Jugoplastika star Dino Radja
(pronounced RAHDjaw).
   The idea of all these dribbling foreigners doesn't please
everyone. "We don't need to go overseas for players," Larry
Bird, the great Boston Celtics star, has asserted. His
comments distressed team officials; the Celtics have the
league's only full-time Eastern European scout, Misho
Ostarckebic (pronounced, oh, never mind). The Celts have also
been pursuing Stojan "Stojko" Vrankovick, a 7-2, 260-pound
Yugoslavian said to have an amazing 37-inch vertical leap.
   Mr. Marciulionis, a 6-5 inch, 200-pound guard with thickly
muscled thighs and huge, powerful hands, was steered into
basketball by the Soviet sport apparatchiks at the age of 10.
At age 18, he made the Soviet team, and quickly became one of
its stars. On the Soviets' 1988 gold medal Olympic team, Mr.
Marciulionis scored 18 points in the defeat of the U.S.
   But since coming to America, Mr. Marciulionis has pretty
much been living in a state of constant confusion --
California. "I have new home, new friends, new climate. I
have much thinking, but not much words . . . trouble
communications with teammates . . . is frustrated but getting
better," he sputters after one recent practice. Though his
English has improved markedly since his arrival, he still
can't speak well enough to understand all the new plays and
new rules that Warriors coaches and American life have thrown
at him.
   This has spawned some revolutionary coaching techniques.
"Two up, two up," barks Warriors assistant coach Garry St.
Jean during a workout, calling for a bread-and-butter
offensive pattern. Mr. Marciulionis holds the ball with a
puzzled look on his face. Mr. St. Jean is explaining what to
do if the center is defended and can't take the pass. "The
center is covered, so you look for the next option," he says.
Mr. Marciulionis flips the ball to the center anyway. "No,
he's covered," Mr. St. Jean explains in a patient, fatherly
way. "Covered."
   Then, suddenly, Mr. St. Jean screams, races from under the
basket, grabs the center's jersey, waves his hand in the
center's face, wraps his arms around the center. Turning to
Mr. Marciulionis, he yells: "Covered." Mr. Marciulionis and
his teammates crack up. They run the play again, and Mr.
Marciulionis gets it right.
   He has adapted quickly in other ways. He lives in a swank
Oakland suburb and owns a black Mercedes. "Is dream come
true," he says. He adds that drivers in California, are "more
gentlemen, more intelligent" than Lithuanian drivers, an
observation that may discourage Americans from car tours of
the Lithuanian countryside.
   At his U.S. basketball debut in the Warriors opening game
in Phoenix, he entered the game at 4:02 of the second
quarter. He started tentatively, passing up an open jumper to
pass off. He stumbled on defense and got called for the NBA's
first Soviet foul. But at 2:01, he took the ball on the right
side, bulled toward the hoop and got fouled. Two free throws.
Swish. Swish. The NBA's first Soviet points.
   The Warriors got clobbered in the game, but Mr.
Marciulionis finished with 17 points. In recognition of his
debut, the NBA has put his jersey from the game on display at
the Basketball Hall of Fame.
   Since the auspicious opener in October, Mr. Marciulionis
has shown powerful moves to the basket and tremendous
competitive fire, but his outside shot, considered one of his
strengths, has been erratic. His defense has at times been
dreadful.
   Mr. Marciulionis vows to do better. "I must come back to
NBA, to prove I belong," he says, standing in front of a
locker. "For myself, for all foreign players. I must improve.
I will improve."

   Waldenbooks, Current Target
   Of a Protest Over Playboy
   Sales, to Pay Most of Cost

<LP>
   The American Booksellers Association and a collection of
bookstore chains and independent store owners are taking out
a full-page ad in 30 major newspapers Monday protesting an
increase in censorship.
   The booksellers' group has publicly protested the banning
of books for years, but this particular protest wasn't
prompted by small-town libraries burning copies of "Catcher
in the Rye." This fight started over bookstores that sell
Playboy magazine, particularly the Waldenbooks unit of K mart
Corp.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As it turns out, the American Family Association, a
Christian group known for pressuring companies who advertise
on certain television shows, plans to picket up to 400 stores
across the country next Friday, mostly K mart and Waldenbooks
stores. The picketing comes on top of a boycott of K mart and
Waldenbooks that was launched several months ago by the AFA.
   The fight began last fall when the AFA's Florida chapter
asked Waldenbooks and other retailers to stop selling Playboy
and Penthouse magazines, saying that the organization would
alert the public to their practice of selling pornography if
they didn't stop. Waldenbooks then joined with the publisher
of Playboy, the American Booksellers Association and various
magazine distributors to sue AFA's Florida director, alleging
the AFA tried to coerce them to stop doing something they
have a legal right to do.
   Oren Teicher, associate director of the American
Booksellers Association, says Waldenbooks came up with the
idea for Monday's ad. He says Waldenbooks provided suggested
copy and will pay most of the $400,000-plus cost of running
the ads. The ABA wanted to sign the ad, says Mr. Teicher,
because the booksellers group sued the AFA along with
Waldenbooks, and because "We wanted to stand together and let
people know that if you attack one of us in the bookselling
business, you attack all of us."
   Judith Krug of the American Library Association in
Chicago, who collects examples of books and magazines banned
by libraries and schools around the country, says she sees an
increase in censorship. "There is a growing intolerance in
this country, a movement to limit what books and magazines
are available," says Ms. Krug. "We just learned that `Little
Red Riding Hood' has been removed from first and second-grade
classes in a California school system because {someone
thinks} it's too violent."
   Waldenbooks Chairman Harry Hoffman says, "I think we've
got to start galvanizing public opinion against censorship
and make people realize it is a growing problem."
   Monday's ad talks about how various groups are fighting to
control the content of textbooks, songs, movies and
television shows, as well as books, and asks readers to fill
out a "ballot" protesting censorship and mail it to the
American Booksellers Association or take it to their local
bookstore. Mr. Hoffman says Waldenbooks stores will all carry
displays of "banned books" to punctuate the point.
   Reaction to the anti-censorship campaign is surprisingly
positive at the American Family Association. Publicity about
it "will let more people know they {Waldenbooks and K mart}
are selling pornography," says executive director Donald
Wildmon of Tupelo, Miss. "You know, we aren't complaining
here about `Huckleberry Finn.' Heck, I read that book when I
was in school, and I think it's pretty terrific. We're just
engaging in our constitutional right to picket stores like K
mart that sell pornography."

   New Pesticide Policy
   May Tighten Rules
   For Processed Foods

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency
announced a new policy that could allow wider regulation of
cancer-causing pesticides found in processed foods, but it is
unlikely to reduce pesticide residues anytime soon.
   For the first time, the EPA said it might ban uses of
pesticides that have long been on the market if their
residues in processed foods pose more than a minimal cancer
risk to consumers. Up to now, the agency had agreed to
enforce a cancer-risk standard on processed foods only for
newly registered pesticides; environmental groups said that
left out at least 66 pesticides that are suspected of causing
cancer in test animals.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While the new policy is a theoretical victory, it is
"really a mixed blessing," said Janet Hathaway, a lawyer with
the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental
group. For example, the policy doesn't mean that EPA will
launch cancer-risk investigations for the 66 pesticides. EPA
officials said their approach will be more gradual; cancer
risks in processed foods will be examined at the same time
the agency conducts lengthy studies on the general safety of
each pesticide now on the market.
   Ms. Hathaway also argued that the EPA's minimal-risk
standard is too lenient. She said her group intends to go to
court to try to force a stricter interpretation of the
so-called Delaney Clause of the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, which she contends demands that any pesticide
posing any cancer risk be banned from food.

   WASHINGTON -- A federal regulator said executives of
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association offered the government an
unusual trade in the days after the feds seized the thrift
last April: We'll give you loan documents if you give us the
art in Lincoln's offices.
   Charles Keating, the colorful chairman of Lincoln's parent
company, called this yet another "ridiculous" exaggeration of
the real story from incompetent regulators.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The takeover was "the most chaotic, incredible situation
I've been involved in," said regulator Keith Seibold. Mr.
Seibold, a 20-year veteran of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., has been in the first wave of regulators in many a
bank seizure.
   Testifying in Mr. Keating's court challenge to the
takeover, Mr. Seibold said "lots of documents -- loan and
credit files -- were missing" when an FDIC team swept through
Lincoln's offices in Phoenix, Ariz., April 14, 1989. He said
that over the next several days, the FDIC managed to retrieve
the documents from Lincoln officials -- in exchange for
giving the officials some of the art that decorated Lincoln's
offices.
   Federal District Judge Stanley Sporkin seemed incredulous.
"You don't actually mean pictures on the wall?" he asked.
"Yes, your honor, pictures on the wall," Mr. Seibold replied.
   But during a break in the trial, Mr. Keating said the
suggestion that there was any bartering to get documents back
was "ridiculous." He explained that Lincoln's files were
spread among two buildings used by Lincoln and by American
Continental Corp., the parent company.
   In sorting out what belonged where after the takeover,
Lincoln's files were returned to Lincoln's building.
Meanwhile, Mr. Keating asked the regulators to return to him
a painting, which hung in Lincoln's offices and was given to
him by his nephew. Mr. Keating also said that Lincoln was
required to keep all original loan files at its headquarters
in Irvine, Calif.
   Mr. Seibold wouldn't speak to reporters about Mr.
Keating's version of the events.
   A few blocks away on Capitol Hill, Rep. Henry Gonzalez,
who made Mr. Keating something of a celebrity with his
hearings on Lincoln last year, called for the Justice
Department to freeze the assets of Mr. Keating and other
"highflyers who have defrauded savings and loans."
   Mr. Keating said Mr. Gonzalez was ignoring the "truth" of
regulatory iniquity that was evident from the trial. "He
prefers his kangaroo court," Mr. Keating said.

   Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd., Johannesburg,
said first-quarter combined net income of its six gold mines
fell 15% to 443.9 million rand ($167.8 million) from 523.4
million rand in the previous quarter.
   South African gold mines supply quarterly, rather than
annual, results, because swings in revenue, tax and spending
tend to obscure the longer comparison. Overall interim and
year-end earnings are reported with year-to-year comparisons.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Anglo American's overall gold production in the first
quarter exceeded 1.9 million troy ounces, a 3.5% decline from
the quarter ended Dec. 31. Sporadic labor unrest and
seismicity caused a drop in gold output by the group's
second-largest producer, Vaal Reefs Exploration &amp; Mining Co.
The third-largest producer, Western Deep Levels Ltd., also
lost output as a result of a fire in the previous quarter.
But Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd., the world's
largest gold mine, improved its performance, despite some
loss of production owing to industrial action and damage
caused by a late-March tornado.

   LITHUANIA URGED energy conservation as Moscow slashed gas
supplies.
   Soviet leader Gorbachev increased pressure on the Baltic
republic by reducing deliveries of natural gas by about 80%.
The move followed Wednesday's cutoff of oil. The Kremlin said
it imposed the sanctions because Lithuania failed to give a
"constructive response" to demands to rescind
independence-related laws. Officials in Vilnius called on
Lithuanians to use energy supplies "most thriftily." In
Moscow, Gorbachev offered Latvia "special status" within the
Soviet Union if it refrained from secessionist moves.

folded up after it lands.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although skeptics abound and no one is sure how the
traveling public will react, Boeing believes that a folding
wing could give it an edge over its competitors, particularly
Airbus Industrie, whose A-330 twin-jet is too wide to fit
into parking spaces now occupied by slimmer, aging aircraft.
"The airlines are really encouraging us to tailor a design so
they'll have no changes to make in their infrastructure,"
says Alan Mulally, vice president for engineering on the
767-X. "We're converging very fast on a practical,
implementable design."
   "This is clearly going to be the way of the future," says
Michael Durham, chief financial officer for AMR Corp.'s
American Airlines, which has prodded Seattle-based Boeing to
explore folding-wing technology. He's also trying to spur
McDonnell Douglas Corp. to try the folding wing on an
advanced version of its newly planned tri-jet, the MD-12X.
James Guyette, executive vice president for operations at
United Airlines, says the UAL Corp. unit is also
contemplating joining the fold as a potential customer.
   But others remain doubtful that the idea will get very
far. And they argue that before an aircraft manufacturer
commits to such a radical move, the aviation industry needs
to consider this fundamental question: Should ever-larger
aircraft be rigged to fit into increasingly packed airports,
or should airports be revamped to handle bigger, more modern
jets?
   The answer is important. Facility managers say overcrowded
gates are one cause of the flight delays plaguing airports
all over the country. According to the Partnership for
Improved Air Travel, an aviation coalition that includes
carriers as well as aircraft manufacturers, 17 of the
nation's major airports experienced significant congestion in
1985. That figure is expected to jump to 58 by the end of
this decade. And the delays are costly, already the
equivalent of grounding 250 commercial planes every day.
   About a year ago, Airbus rejected the idea of using
folding wings on its larger craft, concluding that there
wasn't enough demand to offset the indirect costs of using
such a system. "Airports always have adapted to new
generations of aircraft," says Barnard Ziegler, senior vice
president for engineering at Airbus, the European consortium.
"I don't think folding wings are the right way to solve"
gridlock.
   The folding wing may add a few million dollars to the
price of the plane, not that much in the realm of aircraft.
But it would cost more in other ways. Indeed, airlines have
to consider the extra weight that folding wings would add --
up to 2,800 pounds by Boeing's own estimate. Airbus
calculated that in the case of its A-330, folding wings would
equal the weight of 15 passengers and their luggage.
   On top of that, folding wings would mean more hydraulic
equipment to check and maintain, driving up a carrier's
operating expenses. "Whenever you have another thing to
control from the cockpit, you're increasing the complexity,"
says David Hazen, professor emeritus of aeronautical
engineering at Princeton University. A pre-flight review of
the folding wings couldn't even begin until a plane backed
out onto the tarmac.
   Some also wonder how safe the traveling public would feel
on a plane where nearly a quarter of each wing would swing 90
degrees perpendicularly. "The airline industry doesn't need
to give people one more thing to be afraid of," says Tim
Becker, a former manager with American Airlines and Braniff
and now a marketing professor at San Diego State University.
"It may not be rational, but the public could see the fold as
another fatigue point. They'd be jumpy."
   Also, by fitting a 410-passenger plane into a gate that
now handles a 380-seater at most, "you just aggravate how
full it is inside the terminal," says Francis McKelvey, a
professor of civil engineering at Michigan State University.
"The airport terminals of today are becoming crowded like the
bus terminals of the '40s and '50s. And I don't think the
traveler is going to accept that."
   There aren't any guarantees that Boeing will go ahead with
the folding wing, and there's a chance it will offer the
design simply as an option on some members of the 767-X
family. Officials at the company stress that the
configuration of the twin-engine 767-X -- to be renamed the
777 once the receipt of firm orders officially launches the
line -- is far from certain.
   Yet Boeing is giving the idea far more weight than it did
six months ago. American Airlines says Boeing's engineers are
now saying they've eliminated surplus drag generated by their
first folding-wing models. A few weeks ago, the company
reportedly began building a prototype of the hinges that
would be used to fold up the outer 20 to 25 feet of the
767-X's wings, each of which would be roughly 88 feet long
from tip to fuselage.
   Folding wings aren't revolutionary in and of themselves.
For decades, the Navy has folded the wings of its fighters in
order to position them on the crowded decks of aircraft
carriers. "Some people think the folding wing is a scary
concept," says Bill Whitlow, who follows Boeing for the
Seattle brokerage firm Dain Bosworth Inc. and once piloted
Navy A-3s himself. "But it's no different than fold-up
landing gear. You don't even notice it."
   Airlines today want planes with especially long wings.
That's because an aircraft's efficiency is measured by the
ratio of the wing's width to its span -- what engineers call
the "aspect ratio." The span of the 767-X is 197 feet, nearly
the same as a 747-400 jumbo jet.
   But with open gate areas at airports becoming harder to
find, Boeing has been forced to consider the options in
fitting such long wings into designated areas. The company
looked at parking the 767-X at a 60-degree angle, instead of
pulling it straight in. That, however, could require airlines
to re-jigger their entire ground-support network. "There's a
lot of debate within the airline industry as to what is going
to be the most cost-effective solution," says Steven
Udvar-Hazy, president of International Lease Finance Corp., a
big Boeing buyer. "I think the jury is still out."
   Some, though, have already decided to go for the fold. If
you're going to increase the wingspan, American Airlines' Mr.
Durham declares, "you've just got to be able to bend it."

   Newport News Savings Bank, Newport News, Va., said it
signed a letter of intent to merge with United Financial
Banking Cos., a Vienna, Va.-based bank holding company,
through an exchange of shares.
   In the proposed transaction, the two financial
institutions would exchange stock on a book value-for-book
value basis, as of the last day of the month preceding the
effective date of consolidation. They hope to complete the
transaction by Dec. 31, subject to a definitive agreement, as
well as shareholder and regulatory approvals.
</LP>

   The proposal also calls for two directors of Newport News
Savings Bank, Robert L. Freeman Jr. and Gary A. Suttle, to
become directors of United Financial. United Financial, with
its primary subsidiary, Business Bank, had total assets of
$78 million and equity of $13.2 million as of Dec. 31, 1989.
Newport News Savings Bank would become a second wholly owned
subsidiary.

   ELKINS PARK, Pa. -- Mortgage &amp; Realty Trust said it
suspended its fiscal second-quarter dividend, as a result of
its April 12 filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The trust previously declared a 45-cent-a-share dividend
for the first quarter ended Dec. 31.

   The trust said it will present promptly a plan of
reorganization to be discharged from the Chapter 11
proceedings in time to make a dividend payment prior to June
5, 1991. The trust would thereby preserve its status as a
real estate investment trust for the current fiscal year
ending Sept. 30.
   If this dividend payment schedule isn't met, net income
reported for the six months ended March 31 would be reduced
by a provision for income taxes of approximately $3.8
million. The trust is self-administered, with investments in
floating-rate real estate loans and equities.

   BETHPAGE, N.Y. -- Grumman Corp. is weighing new layoffs
while promising generous severance pay to top executives in
the event they lose their jobs following a takeover.
   John O'Brien, Grumman chairman and president, said after
the annual meeting yesterday that the defense company's
first-quarter earnings will be flat compared with last year's
first-quarter profit of $16 million, or 46 cents a share.
That confirms expectations of securities analysts who follow
the company.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. O'Brien said the company is reviewing all aspects of
its business, including "staffing levels across the board,"
partly with the aim of cutting expenses. "I have no doubt
that we can take many millions of dollars of annual operating
cost out of this company without sacrificing anything of
business value," he said.
   In the proxy statement for the meeting, Grumman also
disclosed the new severance packages, known as "golden
parachutes," which cover 27 "key employees," including Mr.
O'Brien and his top four officers. The plan would pay the
employees 2.99 times their average annual base pay for the
previous five years, if they are dismissed after a change in
control of the company. Mr. O'Brien's base pay in 1989 was
$384,375, before a $180,000 bonus.
   Mr. O'Brien said the companywide review, aided by the
management consultant, McKinsey &amp; Co., could lead to the
divestiture of parts of the corporation. "We're examining the
businesses we're in and how they fit into our corporate
strategy. If there are some that don't fit, we'll divest
them," he said.
   Mr. O'Brien added that Grumman expects to receive a
production contract for the Air Force's Joint STARS flying
surveillance and command system next year, which he has
previously stated could produce between $6 billion and $10
billion in revenue. He added that Grumman anticipates that
its international business will grow by $500 million a year
during the next five years.

   Tokyo stock prices surged for the second straight day
yesterday as the strength of the yen encouraged bargain
hunting over a broad range of shares.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which advanced
787.46 points Wednesday, finished at 29945.41, up 696.35
points.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Trading was active. The pace of the strong advances was
set by sectors such as steel manufacturing, shipbuilding and
gas and electric utilities.
   The popularity of these large-capital stocks pushed up
volume on the first section to an estimated one billion
shares, the highest level since the beginning of this year.
Volume was 489 million shares Wednesday.
   Winners outpaced losers 855 to 141, while 103 issues
remained unchanged.
   In early trading Friday, the Nikkei index was up 35.74
points to 29981.15.
   Thursday's recovery of the yen worked against shares of
electronics makers, which had been bought on expectations
that the weaker yen would benefit these export-oriented
companies, traders said.
   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which advanced 39.39 points Wednesday, was up
45.53 points, or 2.10%, at 2213.49.
   The second section index, which gained 16.76 points
Wednesday, was up 26.87 points, or 0.76%, to close at
3551.43.
   Volume in the second section was estimated at nine million
shares, up from eight million shares Wednesday.
   Active buying started right from the beginning of the day.
   Wednesday's strong advances, despite the dollar's rise
above 160 yen, made investors feel secure about buying
yesterday, traders said. The market's rise supported
investors' belief the Nikkei hit bottom around 27000 points
and that stock prices are unlikely to fall too far below that
level, they said.
   In addition, yesterday's fall in the dollar, in the face
of a favorable report on U.S. trade in February, spawned
expectations the dollar may stabilize below the 160-yen
level, traders said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar opened the day at 158.35 yen,
compared with 158.13 yen in New York late Wednesday and
159.87 yen in Tokyo late Wednesday. The U.S. unit slid
further yesterday to finish at 157.75 yen in Tokyo.
   The yen's sharp recovery boosted trade momentum.
Institutions, corporations and foreign investors actively
sought out stocks that appeared to have been oversold in the
past month and thus had good potential for a technical
rebound, traders said.
   Steel and shipbuilding shares, which are priced mostly
below 1,000 yen, also attracted individual investors, who
have been severely hurt by margin calls, traders said.
   Yesterday's strong winners included Kawasaki Heavy
Industries, which was up 60 yen to 860 yen ($5.47), and Kobe
Steel, which advanced 34 to 613.
   Among utilities issues, Chubu Electric gained 190 to
3,160, while Tokyo Gas was up 43 to 767.
   Also advancing strongly were trading houses such as
Marubeni, which rose 41 to 794, and railway companies such as
Keisei, which gained 80 to 1,630.
   High-technology shares declined. Pioneer was down 120 at
5,950. TDK, which advanced 460 Wednesday, fell 100 to 6,740.
   In London, share prices finished significantly lower, as
the early morning demise of a longstanding technical support
point left investors with little confidence in the market.
   Shares got off to a shaky start on the back of a weak
performance overnight on Wall Street. The jitters continued
throughout the morning as the 2200-point barrier on the
broad-based Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
fell away, leaving investors uncertain of the market's next
direction.
   But most commentators suggested they witnessed no
wholesale selling, as share prices were largely scaled back
by market makers amid a cautious and confused market.
   At the close, the 100-share index was down 21.2 points at
2184.7, off its early morning best of 2194.9 and up a bit
from the midafternoon low of 2180.5. The index last closed
below 2200 on Nov. 22.
   The narrower 30-share index was down 20.4 points at
1712.2. Volume reached a moderately active 491.9 million
shares, compared with the 352.5 million of Wednesday.
   On the corporate front, B.A.T Industries shares finished
just three pence lower at 720 pence ($11.80). The
conglomerate said it has agreed to sell its retail subsidiary
Marshall Field for $1.04 billion to Dayton Hudson Corp. of
the U.S.
   The sale of Marshall Field is part of a major
restructuring of B.A.T to concentrate on its core businesses
of tobacco and financial services operations in an effort to
stave off a takeover bid by Sir James Goldsmith.
   Elsewhere around the market, beverage concern Allied-Lyons
finished up six pence at 432. It said it will sell its
Embassy Hotels chain to Jarvis Hotels Ltd. for #202 million
($331 million).
   Royal Insurance slipped 6 pence to 449. The composite
insurer said it expects losses related to storms in Britain
to amount to #100 million in the first quarter.
   In Frankfurt, West German share prices closed lower, but
above intraday lows, in moderate trading.
   The German Stock Index (DAX) declined 10.89 to end at
1878.87. The blue chips led the market lower, as electronics
concern Siemens dropped eight marks to 762 marks ($455.70),
Daimler-Benz fell 13 to 899 and Deutsche Bank dipped 4.50 to
787. Siemens had been as low as 758 early in the session
before selective buying brought it slightly back.
   Machinery-maker issues were again pushed down sharply, as
Linde fell 9 to 986, MAN dropped 9.50 to 487.50 and
Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz (KHD) fell 2 to 270.
   Elsewhere in Europe, share prices closed higher in
Stockholm, lower in Paris, Zurich, Milan and Amsterdam, and
mixed in Brussels.
   In Asian and Pacific markets, prices closed higher in Hong
Kong and Wellington and were lower in Sydney, Seoul,
Singapore, Taipei and Manila.
                                                                                                       

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The

   Bell Atlantic Corp., U S West Inc. and Nynex Corp., aided

   Pacific Telesis Group and Southern New England

   U S West managed to post an 8.9% increase in net income,
even though revenue from its largest contributor, the
telephone sector, was essentially flat. Jack A. MacAllister,
U S West's chairman and chief executive officer, attributed
the gain to solid growth in the non-telephone sector, which
includes cellular operations, directory publishing and
financial services.
   The Denver company said revenue in the non-telephone group
climbed almost 11% to $405.1 million. Telephone revenue
basically was flat at $2.02 billion. Overall, U S West's
revenue inched up 1.4% to $2.43 billion from $2.39 billion a
year ago.
   Telephone operations were hurt by lower interstate access
charges and rate reductions. However, the sector had strong
growth in new telephone lines, which increased 3% to 12.3
million. Minutes of local long-distance usage also rose to
9.3 million, a 5.4% jump from 8.8 million in the year-earlier
quarter.
   U S West said revenue for its cellular company, U S West
NewVector Group Inc., surged 54% to $58.5 million from $37.9
million. NewVector reported a 66% increase in new cellular
customers. The cellular unit had a loss of about $4 million,
compared with a loss of $5.3 million a year ago.

S West fell 25 cents to $72.50.
                                                                                                       

   Nynex
                                                                                                       

   Nynex said earnings were hampered by a pretax charge of
$39 million for the New York company's previously announced
early retirement program. To date, about 3,100 management
employees plan to retire.
   Nynex's modest 2.8% profit increase largely reflected
contributions from the company's non-telephone operations.
Overall operating profit from the non-telephone business
segments rose about $22 million from a year ago to about $40
million. Cellular telephone operations had a 62% rise in new
cellular customers for a total of 229,000.
   The company also was aided by stringent spending.
Operating expenses rose less than 1% to $2.71 billion,
compared with $2.68 billion a year ago. Despite the soft
Northeast economy, new telephone lines grew about 208,000 to
15.2 million, a 1.3% rise.
   Revenue rose 2% to $3.3 billion from $3.2 billion.
   In Big Board composite trading yesterday, Nynex closed
down $1.50 at $81.75.
                                                                                                       

   Bell Atlantic
                                                                                                       

   At Bell Atlantic, Philadelphia, net rose 7.4%, reflecting
healthy results across the board.
   Revenue rose 9% to $3.02 billion from $2.77 billion. The
revenue growth represents strong volumes in the network
services business, the acquisition of Control Data Corp.'s
third-party maintenance business, and good growth in the
non-telephone business.
   Telephone revenue for local service increased 3.2% to
$1.11 billion from $1.08 billion, while non-telephone
operations, excluding financial and real estate division,
rose 47% to $208.4 million.
   Expenses increased 8.2% to $2.36 billion, generally
reflecting the Control Data acquisition and expanded business
activity.
   Results also include a portion of a $42 million award to
settle charges that its Bell of Pennsylvania unit used
deceptive techniques to sell customers extra services, such
as call waiting and speed dialing.
   Bell Atlantic said cellular customer growth was stymied by
above normal disconnections associated with a legal dispute
involving a former sales agent. The company added 18,200
customers for a total of 207,200.
   Bell Atlantic fell $1.125 to $95.875 in Big Board trading.
                                                                                                       

   Pacific Telesis
                                                                                                       

   Higher expenses and a rate reduction resulted in a 17%
drop in net income for Pacific Telesis. Expenses rose 6.5%,
primarily because of contract-related labor costs,
depreciation and increased expenditures for telephone network
and internal-operating systems improvements.
   The San Francisco company also said results were depressed
by a $391 million rate reduction associated with California's
new regulatory program that became effective in January.
   Overall, all operations performed well. Toll messages grew
11% to 829 million and minutes of access use increased 8.8%
to 9.9 billion. The company's Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell
units added more than 144,000 customers, an increase of 4.2%
for a total of 13.8 million.
   Cellular operations posted a 74% profit gain to $16.9
million. Cellular revenue rose 36% to $134.3 million, and new
customers increased 44% to about 413,000.
   Revenue rose 1.3% to $2.37 billion from $2.34 billion.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Pacific Telesis fell 25 cents to $44.50.
                                                                                                       

   SNET
                                                                                                       

   Southern New England Telecommunications said net dropped
6%, mainly the result of a slowing Connecticut economy and
lower results from the company's telephone operations and
SNET Systems unit.
   In January, the New Haven, Conn., company reduced
telephone rates about 5% to reflect the elimination of a
gross earnings tax on telecommunications services.
   Moreover, the company said higher expenses associated with
higher wages and benefits and litigation against the company
also hurt profit. Costs increased to $318.6 million from
$313.7 million.
   Revenue fell 1% to $401.5 million from $407.1 million.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, SNET
gained 50 cents to $38.50.

   Martin Ebner's Resignation From Board
   Of Zurich Exchange Highlights Dispute
   ----

   ZURICH -- The sudden resignation of maverick banker Martin
Ebner from the board of the Zurich Stock Exchange has drawn
attention to a simmering dispute within the Swiss banking
community over the future of the country's financial center,
market observers say.
   Observers say privately that small banks and large banks
are increasingly taking opposing sides on key issues
affecting the Swiss financial community's future. And Mr.
Ebner's resignation is being viewed as a clear victory for
the big banks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "He is really a leader of the small banks," says one
banker familiar with the situation.
   Mr. Ebner, who is president of BZ Bank Zurich AG, wasn't
available for comment on his resignation. People close to the
situation, however, say he decided to quit when it became
apparent that he lacked the votes needed to shake up the
leadership of the stock exchange's board.
   "He had some opposition from the big banks, and he knew he
had no chance," says one banker.
   One key element of the dispute, several analysts say, is
Mr. Ebner's outspoken criticism of the Swiss stock market's
plans for an expensive electronic trading system. Large banks
are said to favor the idea, while some smaller banks are said
to oppose it as too expensive or even unnecessary.
   In addition, smaller, traditional private banking houses
face enormous costs in meeting the challenge of a
fast-changing global financial industry, and an electronic
trading system would use up resources that could be spent
elsewhere, analysts say.
   Such costs could eventually force some of the smaller,
family-owned Swiss banks to forge alliances with the major
players, CS Holding (Credit Suisse), Union Bank of
Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp., according to analysts.
   "The big banks have the power and financial muscle, and
the smaller ones don't have that," noted Albert Pauchard,
vice president for research at HandelsBank NatWest in Zurich.
   Analysts point to recent takeovers of smaller banks by
larger ones in Switzerland, including the proposed CS Holding
alliance with the much smaller Bank Leu AG. This trend toward
consolidation will continue as Swiss banks seek to prepare
for more competition from abroad.
   The electronic market, which is set to begin next year
with trading in straight bonds at first, has served as a
focal point in the debate over the Swiss banking community's
efforts to modernize as foreign challengers grow stronger.
   Mr. Ebner's role in opposing electronic trading carried
some clout largely because BZ Bank Zurich, a small, upstart
bank that pioneered covered options on Swiss shares, has
captured some 20% of the turnover on the Zurich Stock
Exchange, compared to about 15% each for Union Bank and
Credit Suisse, and about 12% for Swiss Bank Corp.
   Although numerous smaller banks that are members of the
exchange lined up on Mr. Ebner's side on the electronic
banking issue, the big banks prevailed in a narrow, 15-to-14
vote last autumn to approve the startup of electronic
trading. Plans to expand the system from bond trading to
stock trading, however, haven't been finalized, and the
debate has intensified.
   Richard Meier, chief executive officer of the Zurich Stock
Exchange, acknowledged that the debate over the electronic
market could have played a role in Mr. Ebner's decision to
quit the exchange's board. Although Mr. Meier says the stock
exchanges could afford to foot the start-up cost of 35
million Swiss francs ($23.5 million) for the system, he
conceded that there would be additional costs for the 28 ring
banks. Operating costs of the system will be about 4.5
million francs a year.

   L. Gordon Crovitz's March 7 Rule of Law column "Can
Takeover Targets Just Say No to Stockholders?" on the
Delaware court opinion regarding the "just say no" maneuver
to hostile bids highlights the tremendous confusion over the
principle of the time value of money. The Delaware court
maintains that board members are "not under any per se duty
to maximize shareholder value in the short term" and Time
Inc. directors "expressed their concern that their
stockholders would not comprehend the long-term benefits of
the Warner merger." Rubbish.
   The simple truth is that there is no such thing as a
distinction between long-term or short-term value. There is
only one value: present value; the present value of the
existing cash flow (the amount together with the risk of it
decreasing over time) and the present value of futures
estimates of cash flow (the amount together with the risk of
it being realized).
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Managements' job is to create wealth for their
shareholders as well as to communicate and sell their game
plan to the marketplace to evaluate its merits on a
continuing basis. If the stock price doesn't reflect the
value of what management ascribes to its investment plan, it
means that its current and prospective shareholders don't
concur with management, and the investment program should be
scrapped or revised. This is the market's disciplining
process, which ultimately holds management and directors
accountable to their employers (i.e. shareholders).
Conversely, if management is sacrificing lucrative long-term
investment alternatives to prop up "short-term" earnings, the
auction market for the stock will reflect this.
   It is ironic and frightening that while most of the world
is moving toward less government control in market
transactions, our state courts and legislatures are suddenly
anxious to impose economic solutions on microevents that have
enormous wealth consequences not only for the individuals
involved but for society at large as well.
   Mr. Crovitz is correct in suggesting that there is only
one fair, efficient and equitable way in which to handle
mergers, hostile bids, greenmail or whitemail or any matter
that seriously affects the company's stock value. Not the
courts, not the directors, and not the management, but the
owners should decide vis-a-vis a shareholders' referendum as
a basic exercise of fundamental property rights.

   Mr. Crovitz was right on target about an illness that
pervades business today and, by extension, the U.S. economy.
With few exceptions, major corporations' boards are dominated
by a self-elected elite -- the management of the companies
they pretend to run in the interests of the shareholders.
   It is not surprising then that these boards continue to
make decisions, such as Time Warner's decision to reject the
Paramount tender offer, that demonstrably serve only the
interests of management. The amazing thing is that the
courts, as in the Delaware decision, continue to aid and abet
management.
   The loss of property value illustrated by the fall of Time
Warner's stock price after it rejected Paramount's bid could
be mirrored many times on the other side of such transactions
by showing the loss in stock values suffered by shareholders
of acquiring companies whose boards authorize the payment of
ridiculously high premiums (and ridiculously high fees) for
companies they acquire. In either case, does anyone think the
shareholders concerned would vote in favor of their board's
action if given the chance? In effect shareholders are being
robbed of their most fundamental right -- the right to
dispose of their property as they choose.

   FDA Urged to Require

   With Stricter Warning

   WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration was urged
to require that Halcion, a popular sleeping pill, carry a
stricter warning label that cautions users about potential
side effects.
   An FDA advisory committee recommended last September that
the label on the Upjohn Co. product warn users that they may
suffer temporary amnesia. But the Public Citizen Health
Research Group, a public-interest lobby, petitioned the FDA
yesterday for even stricter labeling requirements, including
a warning that Halcion is more likely than other sleeping
pills to cause delirium, depression and hallucinations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman for Kalamazoo, Mich.-based Upjohn denounced
the petition as "medically unjustified and unnecessarily
alarming to millions of patients who have been or are being
successfully treated with Halcion."
   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, the public interest group's director,
charged that the FDA failed to release to the advisory
committee a 1988 study by two FDA scientists that was highly
critical of Halcion. The study said that complaints passed by
Upjohn to the FDA raised serious questions about Halcion
compared to other sleeping pills. The study also argued that
the large number of consumer complaints about the drug could
not be attributed to critical stories in the media.
   Dr. Paul Leber, director of the FDA's division of
neuropharmacological drug products, said the unpublished
study was "not the same as an agency report," and had "no
official standing." He added, "I don't think there's anything
in that manuscript that wasn't presented to the committee."
Another FDA study of Halcion, also critical of its side
effects, was presented at the September meeting.
   FDA officials said that they will review the Public
Citizen petition.

   BROOKLYN UNION GAS Co. (New York) -- Moody's Investors

bonds and industrial revenue bonds of this natural gas
company to single-A-1 from double-A-3. Approximately $600
million of debt is affected. The rating concern said its
downgrade reflects expected continued deterioration in

billion of debt is affected. The upgrade reflects a

Poor's Corp. said it lowered to triple-C-minus from

company's $57.5 million face amount of 6.5% convertible
subordinated debentures, due 2011. The rating concern said
its downgrade reflects National Education's "substantial
debt-service requirements and limited liquidity caused by the
unsuccessful integration of recent computer-based training
company acquisitions." S&amp;P said National Education has so far
been unsuccessful in raising a minimum of $10 million in
additional capital required before May 1 by a bank credit
agreement. It said the company's "negative cash flow,
strained liquidity, and lack of additional borrowing capacity
reduce its ability to service debt."

   DALLAS -- Texas Instruments Inc. narrowly avoided the
first-quarter loss it had warned of in January, but only
because it sold a majority interest in one of its operations.
   The electronics and semiconductor maker reported net
income of $13 million, or five cents a share, down 85% from
year-earlier net of $84.6 million, or 90 cents a share. The
earnings included a pretax gain of approximately $15 million
from the sale of a majority interest in the company's
photomask operation. The company's operating loss for the
quarter was $2 million.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue declined 3.8% to $1.54 billion from $1.59 billion.
Company officials blamed a weak semiconductor market.
   And while Jerry R. Junkins, chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said March semiconductor orders were at
their highest level in more than a year, prices are still
soft. "We expect the second quarter to be about as difficult
as the first," he said.
   Despite the gloomy short-term outlook, Mr. Junkins told
shareholders at the annual meeting that semiconductor demand
will grow throughout this year and approach double-digit
levels by the fourth quarter. In the long term, he said, the
world semiconductor market will grow from $50 billion this
year to about $200 billion by 2000.
   Texas Instruments also was hurt by the decline in defense
spending, recording a 66% drop in defense orders for the
first quarter and projecting annual revenue growth of no more
than 2% for the next decade. The defense group has been Texas
Instruments' second-largest revenue generator, last year
contributing $2.1 billion of the company's $6.5 billion in
revenue.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Texas Instruments shares closed at $35.50, down 87.5 cents.

   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- MCA Inc. said that first-quarter
net income rose 15% to $31.6 million, or 42 cents a share,
despite a $21.5 million loss attributable to the
entertainment concern's stake in Cineplex Odeon Corp.
   In the year-earlier quarter, MCA posted net income of
$27.3 million, or 37 cents a share. Those results included
$5.2 million of profit from Cineplex Odeon, the Toronto-based
movie theater chain in which MCA holds a 49.9% stake.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Revenue in the latest quarter jumped 30% to $912.9 million
from $703.3 million.
   MCA results were bolstered by the strong performance of
the company's filmed entertainment group, which benefited
from the continuing success of such releases as "Back to the
Future Part II" and "Born on the Fourth of July." Theatrical
films revenue more than doubled in the quarter to $184.2
million from $79.9 million.
   Revenue from the company's home video and pay television
operations increased by 48% to $169.4 million from $114.3
million. However, the filmed entertainment group's results
were hurt by lower foreign television sales.
   MCA's pretax operating profit climbed 8% to $71.1 million,
including $75.7 million from the filmed entertainment group.
In the year-ago quarter, operating profit was $65.6 million,
including $42.6 million from filmed entertainment.
   MCA's music division posted a 8% increase in operating
profit to $12.6 million, on a 35% increase in sales of $208.5
million. Book publishing profit jumped 72% to $9.9 million
from $5.7 million. Retail and mail order business continued
to show a loss, $9.4 million compared with $8.3 million last
year, partly because the 1990 Easter holiday fell in the
second quarter. Broadcasting and cable operations profits
rose 8% to $3.8 million from $3.5 million.

   STOCKHOLM -- Esselte AB signed a six-year pact with Walt

raising the Disney image around Europe" ahead of the planned
1992 opening of the Euro-Disneyland theme park outside Paris.
Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.

Holland, FilmNet claims to be Europe's biggest satellite
distributed pay-TV service.
   FilmNet has struggled with mounting competition in recent
years, running up hefty losses that finally triggered
Esselte's retreat from the entertainment sector. Martin
Lindskog, president of Esselte's entertainment division, said
he was convinced the link with Disney "makes FilmNet more
attractive to prospective buyers."
   The planned FilmNet auction is being conducted by U.S.
investment bank Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. Though preparations
are still at an early stage, Mr. Lindskog said Esselte has
been approached by about 15 prospective suitors, 10 of which
he described as serious. He declined to identify any of the
companies.
   Mr. Lindskog expects the auction to formally commence next
month and be completed during the autumn. Industry analysts
estimate FilmNet could fetch as much as 2 billion Swedish
kronor ($329 million).

   Marketers See Broadway Shows
   As a Way to Reach the Affluent

   Marketers may have found a new way to reach affluent
consumers -- by linking up with Broadway shows.
   Corporations in the past have hooked up with Broadway
plays and musicals only occasionally, sometimes by investing
money, other times by donating products for use on stage in
exchange for a credit in the program. But now, more
advertisers are considering becoming promotional partners
with Broadway shows -- with the intention of getting their ad
messages to affluent crowds.

   This season, Epi Products, a Santa Monica, Calif., maker
of health and beauty aids, made a sizable financial
investment in "Meet Me in St. Louis," and then used the show
as a venue to attract new consumers to its product line.
   Epi and "Meet Me in St. Louis" shared the spotlight in
radio and print ad campaigns. One promotion offered plane
tickets to New York and tickets to the show's opening as the
top prize.
   "It's been a very happy marriage," says Christopher
Seabrooke, one of the show's three producers. "Epi hasn't
looked on the investment in the show just as a straight
investment. They see it as a promotional tool and as image
promotion for their company."
   American Express also has taken to the Broadway circuit,
having recently sponsored the opening night party of the
revival of "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," which stars Kathleen
Turner and Charles Durning. American Express funded the event
in conjunction with offering a number of tickets to its gold
card members.
   Broadway's relatively affluent audience makes it a natural
for many marketers, says Don White, president of Saugatuck
Direct, a Westport, Conn., direct marketing and promotions
agency. "Our clients are thinking about ways to make their
advertising dollars work harder and to really focus those
dollars on the customers and prospects they really want," he
says.
   Mr. White says that Saugatuck has been shopping the idea
around to a number of big advertisers, adding that the firm
is in discussions with a financial services company and some
packaged-goods firms to develop promotional tie-ins with road
tours of Broadway shows. He says such sponsorships, which
offer an advertiser the prospect of mentions on publicity
materials, ticket stubs and in the program, start at about
$250,000.
   New Musicals, a newly formed producing group that plans to
mount 16 productions over the next four years, also is
talking with a corporation for sponsorship of one of its
first shows, a musical called "Secret Garden." New Musicals
wouldn't name the company with which it is holding
discussions.
   Producers seem intrigued by the idea of promotional
tie-ins. Barry Weissler, a producer whose current shows
include "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" and "Gypsy," says, however,
that corporate participation works only "if they're the right
corporation." The sponsorships and tie-ins need to be geared
to the particular show and to the corporation's needs, he
says.
   For "Meet Me in St. Louis," Epi designed a number of
promotions to boost ticket sales and increase sales of its
own products. At the cosmetics counter at Macy's department
store in New York, for example, Epi offered consumers a free
ticket to the show if they purchased another ticket and an
Epi product.
   But like a conventional investment in a Broadway show,
promotional tie-ins and sponsorships carry a certain amount
of risk. For every Broadway hit, there are many failures.
Corporations, of course, don't have any control on the show's
quality and take a chance with any vehicle.
   "In almost any new marketing initiative, you're going to
take some risk," says Ken Chenault, president of the consumer
card group at American Express. "We do try to carefully
screen the productions. But at the end of the day, it's a
judgment call," he adds.

   Fitzgerald Quits Ketchum
                                                                                                       

   John W. Fitzgerald left his post as chairman of Ketchum
Advertising/USA to take the top post at McCann-Erickson's New
York office.
   At McCann, an Interpublic Group agency, Mr. Fitzgerald
will be vice chairman and chief operating officer. He will
report to John Dooner, who has been president of
McCann-Erickson North America since the end of 1988.
   Ketchum's ad operations were headed up by Mr. Fitzgerald,
who is 43 years old, and Robert W. Kroyer, who is president.
The unit of Ketchum Communications said it hasn't decided
whether to appoint someone to succeed Mr. Fitzgerald.
   In a letter to Ketchum executives, Mr. Fitzgerald said he
left because of a "desire to accelerate personal growth."

   Ad Notes. . . .

   MOVIE INVESTIGATION: The Federal Trade Commission is
looking into whether moves by movie studios to ban on-screen
ads in theaters constitute restraint of trade. A FTC
spokeswoman declined to comment, but a Justice Department
spokesman confirmed that the FTC has been looking at Walt
Disney's decision in February to ban theaters from running
commercials when they show Disney movies. Earlier this week,
Time Warner's Warner Bros. announced a similar move to ban
commercials in theaters.
                                                                                                       

   AMERICAN AIRLINES: DDB Needham was named to handle
advertising for American Airlines in 15 Latin American
countries, including Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela. The
account will bill an estimated $10 million. DDB Needham, a
unit of Omnicom Group, also handles American Airlines'
domestic ad account.
                                                                                                       

   STARKIST: Actor Peter Horton will appear in a TV
commercial touting StarKist Seafood's recently announced
policy not to catch tuna in a manner harmful to dolphins. The
H.J. Heinz affiliate's ad, created by Leo Burnett, Chicago,
will appear tonight during "Dolphins, Whales and Us," a
program on CBS.
                                                                                                       

   NEW ACCOUNT: The Board of Tourism of Mazatlan in Mexico
awarded its $3 million ad account to Castellanos Latina
Advertising, Los Angeles.
